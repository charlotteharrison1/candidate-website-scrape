The Council has now concluded, for our Ward, the long-running consultation on parking and has introduced new measures on speeding. While the Council has, on legal advice, amended or withdrawn the six month trial low traffic neighbourhood schemes funded by Transport for London, we have studied resident reaction to these trial schemes and retained the aspects that were popular.\nWe have retained the 20 miles per hour speed limit area in the east of the Ward that was originally introduced as part of these schemes. Consultation with residents showed this was popular and we are discussing action to achieve more enforcement of the limits. The speed limit area covers Mayfield Road and the roads in the Ward to the east of it. This is the area where, following lengthy consultation, a new parking control area was introduced last November. This has cleared parking from these roads which has encouraged speeding, thus justifying the new controls on speeding. The Council’s consultation exercise on parking reached a successful conclusion last year with the Sutton South Permit Parking Area now introduced. An earlier proposal was thrown out by residents but this proposal achieved majority support, generally by overwhelming majorities, in the roads consulted. We regard this as evidence of the success of the approach of the Council, with successive rounds of careful consultation. The parking permit area will be subject to a review this summer. Do contact us if there are aspects of the scheme you want reviewed.",

What a pity that so much taxpayers’ money has been wasted by the BSBV team before they came to their senses.”\nCouncillor Mary Burstow, Chair of Sutton’s Scrutiny Committee, said: “Of course this is a reason to celebrate, but now we must work to secure the future of St Helier Hospital for generations of Sutton residents to come.\n“This is now a real opportunity for residents, politicians and medical staff to work out exactly how we want to see healthcare delivered in years to come.\n“And it is crucial that that discussion covers the entire capital. London’s health services need to be looked at as a whole and decisions need to be reached that meet the needs of all Londoners.”\nHowever, the uncertainty remains for hospital staff and patients, who are still unclear about what the future holds.",

To ensure a consistent approach throughout the Borough, all local schemes will be drawn into a central strategy and progressed on the basis of an assessment of priorities.\nAn ambitious scheme for the introduction of a 20mph scheme across most of the area of Sutton South Ward west of the Sutton to Belmont railway line has now been included in the “Local Implementation Plan” prepared by Transport for London. This was the subject of proposals put to the local committee in 2015. However, it is on the “reserve list” which means that implementation in the near future is most unlikely.\nA parking scheme for the newly-named Berridge Close is agreed, implementation to coincide with the opening of the adjacent Subsea7 building, as this will lead to more intensive use of the road by those working in the building and accessing the underground car park. Obstructive parking in Berridge Close could lead to problems when the building is occupied, so needs to be avoided. It is proposed that the road will be included in the controlled parking zone with four parking bays in the road, reserved for residents with parking permits. Completion of the building is unlikely before December.\nTraffic and parking schemes were the subject of a session at the December 2015 meeting of the South Sutton, Cheam and Belmont Local Committee, when residents noted down parking and traffic problems. A list of the proposals raised by residents was reported back to the local committee meeting on 10 March.\nIn relation to our own area, the proposals fell into three main categories.\nFirst, concerns about intensive and sometimes obstructive parking in Mayfield Road and roads nearby (The Ridgway, Chalgrove Road, Upland Road).\nSecond, concerns about visibility at the Farm Road / The Ridgway junction.\nThird, a set of other concerns, mostly about speeding at various locations.\nThis listing will form the agenda for further work by the traffic department within a wider cross-Borough study, which is centrally managed by the Council. A number of minor, initial proposals were agreed on 10 March, including to restrict parking at the Prior Avenue / Banstead Road junction due to visibility issues.\nThe question of a parking control scheme in Mayfield Road and the surrounding area was the subject of a consultation exercise by local Councillors last year which showed support in Mayfield Road but not adjacent roads. On 10 March the local committee agreed to devote some of its public realm funds to fund the traffic department to “kick start” a study of potential for parking controls in this area. A discussion between traffic engineers and Ward Councillors to consider this study was held on 8 June in Mayfield Road. The traffic engineers will design a parking control scheme for consultation. The precise parameters of this scheme and the consultation have yet to be finalised. Consultation with residents is due to begin in January 2017.\nSome residents of Audley Place have commented to us that there is difficulty when driving out of Audley Place in seeing vehicles coming down Camborne Road, if cars are parked close to the corner. We raised this issue with traffic engineers and the Council is proposing a small extension of the yellow lines on each side at the exit from Audley Place. We think this will do the trick in terms of making it easier, and safer, to drive out into Camborne Road.\nResidents of Tapestry Close have complained to us about obstructive parking in the Close. We raised this issue with traffic engineers and a scheme of yellow lining was proposed. Further consultation with residents, required by law, found some residents objecting and this scheme is currently on hold.\nSeveral schemes consulted on some time ago have now been implemented, including yellow lining at the bottom of Downside Road to deal with obstructive parking (see photo above) and switching some “pay and display” bays to “dual use” so residents with parking permits can use them, in Grange Road and Langley Park Road.",

This piece of equipment will add to the fun of the local area, without, in the opinion of local Councillors, being of a size or on a scale that will have an unacceptable environmental impact on the nature reserve. The Headmaster of the school has indicated his support for this project.\nCouncillors have agreed to work with local environmentalists to encourage the proliferation of the small blue butterfly, sometimes found on the site.\n“This is a good start to improving play facilities for children in Sutton South Ward” said Councillor Honour. “We really do need to take seriously the lack of open spaces in our Ward.”\nCouncillor Clifton added “Another good outcome from this discussion of the nature reserve is that both Councillor Honour and I will be examining whether there are ways of drawing on the enthusiasm of local gardeners to seek to improve the natural habitat of the small blue butterfly, which is sometimes found at the reserve.”",

Richard raised over £26 000 for his charity appeal for Sutton Shopmobility and the Alzheimer’s Society.\nIn the course of his Mayoral year Richard attended several hundred events in the Borough. The range of these events is enormous. They include:\n- opening the various open-air festivals, carnivals and fêtes that are held in Sutton in the summer months\n- opening new shops, pubs and business premises\n- attending events at churches, mosques, the synagogue and schools\n- attending school prizegiving evenings at most of our schools in Sutton\n- taking part in many Citizenship ceremonies, at which local residents from distant parts of the world took British citizenship\n- attending many 100th birthday parties\n- attending scout camps\n- attending award ceremonies, particularly for young people and for the many groups of cadets – police cadets, sea cadets, air cadets and the combined cadet forces of some of our schools\n- turning on the Christmas lights, which he did four times.\nAnd of course hundreds of events organised by the many voluntary groups in Sutton. And going to a few football and cricket matches, not just Sutton United but many local teams who have invited him to their games and to give out the awards at end-of-season prizegivings.\nHe has also represented the Borough at important events in London and in Surrey where the Borough should be represented, ranging from the pan-London Citizenship Ceremonies organised by the Mayor of London to more poignant occasions such as the service at Westminster Abbey to remember those killed in the terrorist action in Westminster last March.\nHe has also held receptions in the Mayor’s Parlour for about a dozen groups of people whose contribution to Sutton needs to be recognised – including carers, the local business community, food bank volunteers, the arts network, and of course Sutton United Football Club.\nRichard recollects that there was a day in March when, in one day, he opened the new Poundland store in Sutton town centre, opened the Red Lion pub in Hackbridge which had been closed for re-furbishment, attended a 100th birthday party for a local resident, and held a reception for food bank volunteers in the Mayor’s Parlour. And there were two other invitations on that day that he had to pass to his Deputies as he could not fit them in. This demonstrates the demands on his time\nRichard has had to do some challenging things as Mayor, including dressing up as Father Christmas to go out with the Sutton and Cheam Rotary Club collecting money for charity. This has left him with a rich fund of anecdotes about his discussions with small children when dressed as Father Christmas, which he offers to regale people with.\nRichard sometimes had to chair the Annual General Meetings of local groups who have it in their constitution that the Mayor will chair their AGM. Chairing Council meetings is sometimes a bit tricky, so you would think that chairing the meetings of bodies like the Sutton Swimming Association, Sutton Seniors Forum and the Friends of Whitehall would be a doddle. It was not always so.\nRichard said when he was elected that he hoped his Mayoralty would be remembered for some good music. There have been some great concerts to support his charity appeal, including by The Surrey Yeomanry Band, the Sutton Youth Wind Orchestra, The Phoenix Concert Band, the Norwood Wind Ensemble and the Show Choir – not to mention the group of musicians led by Richard that played Christmas carols in the St Nicholas Centre on several Saturdays before Christmas to raise funds, and the performance by the Clockhouse Choir at one of his dinners. Councillor Wendy Mathys attended all his concerts so deserves a special prize.\nIt has to be said that 2017 was a good year to be Mayor of Sutton as the year will be remembered as ranking alongside 1970 (remember Leeds United) and 1989 (remember Coventry City) as a year when Sutton United football club achieved great things in the FA Cup. The Mayor was one of the people guaranteed a ticket for the Sutton United v. Arsenal match, when the team acquitted themselves with honour, so a good year to be Mayor. There was worldwide interest in the Arsenal match, so much so that before the match he was much in demand for interviews on the general theme of “where is Sutton?”. He was interviewed by radio and TV teams from, amongst other places, Turkey, Russia and South Korea.\nRichard’s charity appeal has raised over £26 000 for his two excellent charities.",

There was a good turnout of Sutton South Ward members for what was a packed meeting.\nPaddy accepted that we live in difficult times but stressed that we must hold on to our liberal values. In a wide ranging discussion following his address members stressed that given the result of the 2010 election, with a hung Parliament, it was the responsible thing for the Liberal Democrats to enter a coalition. We had taken the edge off what would otherwise have been more extreme Tory policies, and there were benefits. Members stressed the need to maintain our concern, as Liberal Democrats, for equality, diversity, internationalism, multi-culturalism and helping the less fortunate.

This was the message last night, Monday 7th March, from Councillor Heather Honour speaking at the Council debate on the budget.\nShe said that it was good news that people were living longer. But over the next 20 years the population of those over 65 years would grow by 50 per cent, that the number of people over 90 would treble and the number of people with learning disability of working age would grow by 30 per cent.\nThey would need support from the state and from their families in managing their personal care and everyday living, social care in other words.\n“This is relevant to us today in our debate on a budget where Eric Pickles has reduced our formula grant by 13.3 per cent. I have been told that were it not for the additional £2billion allocated by the government for social care across the country, the reduction in our grant would have been 17 per cent. Set this against the research published by the Dilnot Commission on Future Funding of Care and Support that carers were willing to contribute an extra 13 per cent of their time to care for their loved ones but the need for care would grow by 55 per cent.”\nShe said” As we go forward we will need to preserve and develop the services that keep us fit and healthy, prevention as it is called. An example is the chair based exercise class organised by Age Concern at Granfers Hall. This was a lifeline for my late mother giving her confidence to go out and the opportunity to meet people in a similar situation to her”.\nThe personalisation agenda, giving everyone receiving social care an individual budget, would be better value as individuals chose the services that suit them.

The owners are again seeking to extend the building, creating a further 29 flats by adding two extra storeys on the top of the ten storey part of the building and an extra storey on the lower part, with some additional flats in the “undercroft” above the parking area. Some of the current parking spaces would be lost.\nAn earlier similar application was not supported by Sutton Council on the basis of design of the proposed tower extension and issues about the alignment of the windows. Planning law allows developers to seek to over-ride the decisions of local Councillors by appealing to the remote Bristol-based Planning Inspectorate, whose decision is final. The developers went to appeal, to the Planning Inspectorate, and on 5 October Richard and Louise attended and spoke on behalf of residents at a hearing organised by the Planning Inspectorate.\nWe had noted that there would be some positives, such as the creation of a community amenity and play space on the tarmaced area at ground floor level. However, while there is a shortage of accommodation in London and more housing is needed, we were concerned that the building work had the potential to be extremely disruptive to the lives of current residents. And an extra two storeys on the top of the building looks incongruous and out of keeping with the design of the rest of the building. Richard told the Inspector the design “looked like a couple of portacabins had been dumped on the top of the building.” At the hearing we told the Planning Inspector that residents of Northumberland House are concerned about the likely disruption involved in this proposed work, and have long standing concerns about frequent lift breakdowns in the building and the general standard of housekeeping, particularly in the bin area. We pressed the Inspector to impose conditions, if he were to agree to the scheme, to protect the interests of residents, and include these conditions in any planning permission they eventually obtained. We asked that access to the roof areas would be only by external hoists, and that the peace and quiet of the interior of the building would not be disturbed or the interior turned into a storage area, or building site. We sought controls on scaffolding to ensure any scaffolding that is required is removed as soon as the requirement has passed. We insisted there must be a construction management plan to control hours of work and control noise and dust nuisance. We asked that the contractor joins the “Considerate Contractors Scheme”, which provides a route for residents to raise concerns if they observe poor behaviour. We were pleased that the developers indicated they would accept all these conditions.\nThe Inspector supported our views and commented that the proposed building looks “incongruous” – the exact wording Richard had used at the hearing. He turned down the application and also refused the application for costs.\nThe owners have now submitted a further, similar application. Residents can see the proposals via the Council’s website (go to the section on planning and follow leads to get to comment on planning applications). It is application DM2023/00796. We are keen to learn of the views of residents on this matter, particularly those who live in Northumberland House. Do contact us at the email addresses given in the first post on this site.",

Their track record is simply dreadful.”\nSome observers believe the problems started in April 2010 when NHS Croydon was given the added responsibility of hosting London Specialised Commissioning Group. It is thought that running the £800million project may have stretched the resources of officers beyond their ability to cope.\nThe committee, which is comprised of councillors from Sutton, Richmond, Croydon, Merton, Wandsworth and Kingston, meet again on 24 September. It will call a number of witnesses including Ann Radmore, Chief Executive of NHS South West London.\nMs Radmore was appointed Sector Chief Executive for South West London in 2009 and led the establishment of the SWL Cluster in early 2010.\nAnother witness will be Dr Peter Brambleby, who was Croydon’s Director of Public Health from March 2010 to February 2012. On 6 July he blew the whistle on NHS London’s decision on 28 June to try to hide the deficit as a ‘prior period adjustment’ which, despite Dr Brambleby’s revelation, the South West London Cluster tried to repeat on 26 July.\nHeather added: “Key personnel involved in the Better Service Better Value team planning the future of healthcare in south west London are involved in this Croydon mess. What confidence can we have in their plans for St Helier?”",

If you received this email, we trust you realised it was a scam.\nRichard says “I am astonished at the number of people who contacted me to say this has happened to them. Interestingly, there is a very good article on Scams in the recent, excellent newsletter from the South Sutton Neighbourhood Association (SSNA). This advises, if you suspect a scam or are a victim, to contact Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040, and advertises a booklet produced by the Metropolitan Police Operation Sterling Team which can be obtained by calling 0207 230 1228.”\nWe recommend joining the SSNA if you live in the area the Association covers.

Our residents are among those affected by and objecting to this proposal.\nWe objected to the proposal on the grounds that it is overdevelopment of the site, with 50 dwellings crammed in. It is the type of low-quality accommodation that we continue to oppose in Sutton South Ward, where so many houses have been demolished to give way to flats. There is as a result a shortage of larger family homes and many children grow up in a flat with no garden. In addition, as many objectors pointed out, the provision for car parking (33 car parking spaces for 50 dwellings) was inadequate and will lead to great pressure on parking, with additional demand for parking in an area that is already fully parked up much of the time.\nWe will continue to oppose this type of development. We oppose the demolition of family homes to make way for blocks of small flats as it is leading to an imbalance of housing in the Ward. Unfortunately the developer can appeal to the Planning Inspectorate and in both Albion Road and Eaton Road (the site pictured above) there are current examples of houses demolished after the Council rejected the application but the Planning Inspectorate granted it. We cannot control that aspect of the process but will continue our campaign to protect the quality of housing, and life, in Sutton South.",
  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_category_news_page_21/content_777.html": "Here is Councillor Simon Wales, chair of the Sutton Gateway Project Board (on which Richard represents Sutton South), cutting the ribbon to open the side entrance on 26 September.\nAnd, below, this is what it used to looks like – shuttered and barricaded.\nWork is completed and the new side entrance to Sutton station is open. Hooray.\nA further meeting of the project board guiding the Sutton Gateway project, a board on which Richard represents Sutton South Ward, heard on 25 September that good progress is being made with the scheme.\nThe most important news is that the building work on the side entrance is completed enabling the passageway from The Quadrant to be restored and the side entrance to be opened for passenger use. The side entrance is open from 7am to 7pm.The cycle racks next to the newly opened side entrance have been improved.\nWork at the front of the station commenced in September and will be completed by March 2015, but with no work over the Christmas period to avoid any inconvenience to shoppers. Some of the work will involve traffic diversions.\nThe project’s proposals to further develop the area around Sutton station include:\n– refitted shop fronts, new paving and newly planted trees to improve the look of the area\n– more lighting and CCTV cameras to make the area safer\n– extra cycling facilities, with new bike racks and shelters\n– a town centre clock\n– a new crossing in Brighton Road\n– the opening of the side entrance to Sutton station\n– new “legible London” signs\n– a re-arrangement of the bus stops to reduce congestion\n– an additional crossing for pedestrians outside the station\n– re-design of the Cedar Road / Brighton Road junction to improve visibility for motorists\n– it is not proposed to move the taxi rank, except that after 6.30 some taxis will be able to park immediately opposite the station, with the bus stop opposite the station moved further down Brighton Road and with some buses stopping in Mulgrave Road\n– there will be “live” bus information in Sutton station, subject to further research by Network Rail\n– the timing of the pedestrian crossing at the High Street / Grove Road / Sutton Court Road junction will be amended to give more time to cross\n– the number of parking spaces in the station area will be increased\n– general improvements in design and to the “public realm” around the station, with more flowers, more colour and better signage.\nThe changes, including the changes to the bus stops, will be completed by March 2015.\nThese changes are largely funded by grants the Council has obtained, not local Council tax payers.\nThe results of the earlier consultation exercise on the Gateway Project indicated general support for the scheme, but we were able to make a number of changes to respond to specific issues raised. In our Ward, a particular concern for the businesses was the need for a loading bay on Regents Parade just south of the station. We successfully lobbied for this to be incorporated into the scheme.\nOn 27 February Richard and former Ward Councillor Heather Honour organised a breakfast meeting with local businesses in our Ward to take their views on the Sutton Gateway project. Several joined us in the Rose Café in the Brighton Road, which serves excellent scrambled eggs (Richard’s breakfast). This is right in the area that is to be developed so we were able to chat and walk round the area to see the proposed changes.\nPublic consultation on the emerging proposals ran till 5 March. Consultation was by leaflets in the locality, questionnaires to members of the public, posters, newspaper advertisements, exhibitions, further “stakeholder” meetings and putting information in Sutton station.\nResidents and businesses close to the station were consulted, together with the emergency services and other groups with a major interest such as Network Rail, Southern Rail and TfL.\nAlso of great value will be the “legible London” signs at the station entrance. See the designs at\nhttp://www.tfl.gov.uk/microsites/legible-london/3.aspx\nRichard says “As a local man who for twenty years of my life commuted to central London by a route that meant I walked every working day along Wellesley Road and past the shuttered and barricaded side entrance, to enter the station from the front, it has long been an objective of mine to get the side entrance open. Every second counts when you are a commuter.”",

Trish was first elected in 2014 and was re-elected in 2018 and 2022. Louise was elected in 2022. Richard served as Mayor of Sutton for 2016-17 and Trish was our Mayor for a record three yearly terms, to May 2023. Louise is our Deputy Mayor for a second successive year, through to May 2025.\nLouise, Richard and Trish at City Hall presenting the petition opposing ULEZ signed by over 10 000 Sutton residents\nCONTINUE DOWN THE PAGE TO OUR CURRENT NEWS STORIES\nOR CLICK ON THE LINKS BELOW TO GO TO OUR SPECIFIC PAGES\nThe statue “The Messenger” by David Wynne, in The Quadrant, is close to the boundary between our Ward and Sutton Central Ward\nOn 10 April there was a remarkable victory for the Liberal Democrat candidate, Richard Choi, in a by-election to elect a Councillor for Sutton Central Ward on Sutton Council. Sutton Central Ward is immediately north of our Ward, Sutton South.\nRichard got more votes than all the other six candidates added together. The result was\nLiberal Democrats 1291\nConservatives 327\nReform 282\nLabour 216\nThree other candidates (the Greens, an independent and the Christian People’s Alliance) each got less than 100 votes.\nThe Liberal Democrat share of the vote increased by 17.4%, the Conservatives fell by 10% and Labour – who finished second in this seat in 2022 – by 17.4%.\nOn 3 March the Council discussed the budget proposals for the coming year. Legally, the Council is required to set a balanced budget. With so many Councils going bust or in great financial difficulty, this was always going to be a difficult task. The problems are due to a legacy of Government cuts but also a big spike in demand for services. While people think of the Council as the body that mends the potholes, empties the bins and fixes the street lights, 70% of spending is on adult social care and children’s services (particularly for those children with special educational needs), plus the cost of finding accommodation for the homeless. There has been an increase in demand in the past year, particularly in the number of adults whose social care has to be paid for by the Council, the number of children with special educational needs and in the number of homeless families.\nRichard spoke in the debate, on homelessness – a subject in which he has a special interest due to the work history of his daughter, Ellie, who worked for many years for a homelessness charity and because as chair of Planning Committee he has a role in increasing the supply of affordable family accommodation.\nHere is Richard’s speech:\n“I would like to direct the attention of Council to paragraph 8.11 of the supplemental agenda which is discussing financial risks.\nIt says that the biggest driver of overspending by London boroughs is the number of people presenting as homeless and who need to be offered temporary accommodation.\nThe paper tells us Sutton had 1 084 households homeless and in temporary accommodation in October last year. It is a higher figure tonight. It is a frightening figure. Tonight we are discussing homelessness as a financial risk to the Council, but we all recognise that the fundamental reason for our concern is that behind so many of these cases are stories of tragedy, of families losing their homes and often winding up in bed and breakfast accommodation remote from their workplace and remote from the schools their children attend.\nThere is a housing crisis and we need more homes. Residents comment on the number of new flats being built in the centre of Sutton but we need this accommodation.\nThe aspiration of the Government to build more homes is right – but it has to be tempered by a concern about quality and about dealing with the consequences.\nSutton is very built up. It is not always easy to see where the new homes will come from, particularly when we are all rightly sensitive to the concerns of residents about inappropriate development and the pressures intensification can bring.\nIt is worthwhile re-stating the principles in our local plan for Sutton.\nWe need more housing, but it must be of good quality – good enough for Sutton, which means of high quality.\nWe aim to reduce development pressures on what I call the “suburban heartland” of the borough by concentrating development in the areas where development is appropriate.\nIn particular there is a zone of potential intensification close to the town centre where public transport connections are good. This may mean some tall buildings. It may mean car free or car light development as you can provide much more accommodation if you do not have to provide a parking space for every unit, and this is more acceptable in areas close to the railway station and the town centre where public transport connections are good.\nWe have a local plan, currently under review, which sets out how we meet the requirements for infrastructure to support an increase in population, which is an important concern of residents.\nI am always keen to point out that our local plan is not like the local plan you might find in, for example, North Korea, mandating what will be built. It is aspirational. It depends on developers bringing forward proposals. Its success depends a lot on the skills of our planning staff in negotiating with developers to secure what is good for Sutton, which may not be what makes most profit for the developer. I would like to pay tribute to the work of our planning staff and in particular the head, Andy Webber, who retires this month.\nIn the past year the planning system has had a bad press. The Government says we are going for growth, growth, growth. Quite right. But when asked what are the impediments to growth they invariably cite the planning system – which is represented as run by NIMBYS frustrating necessary development. That might well be the case in some places – not here in Sutton of course. But I think there is a counter argument that the planning system is a bastion against having fields and fields of sub-standard housing, as that is what makes money for developers. We destroy the planning system at our peril. But it is also right that we need a planning system that does not stand in the way of necessary change and renewal, but ensures high quality and appropriate development, to provide housing and to stimulate the economy.\nI think we have a good track record in Sutton in supporting high quality development and there are many examples in our borough of developments characterised by good design providing quality housing and infrastructure. That is what we need.”\nThe bench at the junction of The Ridgway and Mayfield Road\nThere are a number of locations in our Ward where there are benches to enable weary pedestrians to put up their feet. At the most recent meeting of the Council’s local committee we got agreement to re-new two benches in the Ward that have deteriorated over time. These are benches in Copse Hill and the one in the photograph, which is at the junction of The Ridgway and Mayfield Road.\nThere is a history to some of the benches in our Ward. In 1988 the South Sutton Neighbourhood Association celebrated the tenth anniversary of its foundation by funding a bench in Cavendish Road close to Ambleside Gardens. The bench was, after over twenty years of use and exposure to the elements, in a very sorry state. We took action to get the bench restored, with the plaque explaining the history of the bench moved to the new bench.\nOn the 27th of January Sutton Council met. Richard raised the issue of the reasons why a recent survey by The Times newspaper ranked Sutton as the eighth most attractive place to live in England. This finding does not surprise us. We spend a lot of time knocking on the doors of our residents to introduce ourselves as your local Councillors and we find people generally say they really like Sutton, mentioning a strong sense of community, open spaces, low crime, good schools, a green and pleasant environment, parks, street trees, being convenient for London and for the countryside. This is particularly the case with people who have moved to Sutton from elsewhere, particularly those from other London boroughs, from Hong Kong and from Ukraine. Please write to us and tell us what you like about Sutton or think we can improve.\nWe are always keen to look at ways of improving our Ward.\nLast year traffic engineers undertook a study of traffic flows in our Ward and the results of the exercise are listed in a later post on this site. The results have not led to some “standout” conclusion as to a problem that needs tackling but traffic officers are examining three main issues:\nwhether action can be taken to improve the safety and the experience of pedestrians crossing the Kings Lane bridge without closing the road to vehicles. The bridge is narrow. Installing a second bridge would be impossibly expensive. Marking a pedestrian path at one side of the road might be feasible. We would welcome the views of users of the bridge, both pedestrians and motorists\nsimilarly, whether something can be done to improve the safety and the experience of pedestrians passing under the railway bridge in Langley Park Road. Some proposals are to be consulted on\npossible improvements to the busy junction where Cedar Road crosses Langley Park Road. Residents have spoken to us of the difficulties pedestrians have in crossing Langley Park Road. Consultation with residents in adjacent streets is underway on proposals to install two new traffic islands in Langley Park Road. These will form a safe area in the middle of the road so the road can be crossed by pedestrians in two phases.\nYour views on these issues, and views on any other traffic and parking issues you would like us to look at would be welcomed.\nThe police met residents of Sutton South Ward again on the evening of 15 January 2025, at Devonshire Avenue school. There are open, public meetings held quarterly at which the police discuss the policing of the Ward with local residents. We were addressed by our Ward Constable, Constable Robyn Skivens, who went through the crime statistics for the Ward. Sutton has a lower crime rate than most outer London boroughs and our Ward has one of the lowest crime rates in Sutton. However, crime always has a significant impact on the victim and public concern remains high. The draft minutes of the meeting are as below.\nSUTTON SOUTH COMMUNITY / POLICE MEETING. 15 JANUARY 2025 Attended by PC Robyn Skivens and PCSO Helen Maguire for the police. A report was given on main crime trends from 1 September to the date of the meeting. DRUG OFFENCES There had been 18 drug offences, mainly possession of drugs, mainly cannabis. While this was higher than normal the increase was partly attributable to a special police operation at Sutton train station. Four of these crimes were the interception by the Border Force of drug shipments. Where such a shipment is to premises in our Ward it will count in our statistics. BURGLARY There had been 21 burglaries or attempted burglaries. This included residential burglaries, burglaries of garages and sheds, and some burglaries of businesses. It was noted that there was usually a seasonal increase in burglary at this time of year as it was darker earlier. There had been eight residential burglaries. However, some that had been reported in sheltered accommodation in the Ward were later disproved and attributed to dementia. A disturbing case was that of a landlord who was able to let himself into a flat and commit theft. Two burglaries of garages had involved theft of bicycles. Mention was made of a shop in Brighton Road where the window was smashed and the wooden panel that was then put in place to secure the premises was pulled away to facilitate burglary. Mention was made of the theft of tools from a construction site in the Ward. Some burglaries had involved the theft of keys, which were then used to commit further offences (theft of a car key leading to theft of a car). The police stressed the need to make sure keys were kept out of sight – if the keys can be seen from your letterbox you are inviting crime.\nVEHICLE CRIME\nThere had been 14 instances of vehicle crime (theft of vehicles, damage to vehicles, theft from vehicles). The police stressed the need to avoid leaving anything of value on display in your car, or in the car at all. An unusual crime had been the theft of an excavator and a dumper from the road works in Brighton Road. THEFT There had been 23 crimes in a category the police described as “theft and kindred (to theft)” events. This included shoplifting, parcel theft, theft of pedal cycles and mobile phones. Examples mentioned included theft of scrap metal, theft of a wheelie bin and theft of a wedding ring by distraction techniques. MAJOR CRIMES There had been nine major, violent crimes in the Ward. This included several robberies at the train station, a large group altercation outside a restaurant, a fight between two drug users, and a concerning incident of a woman who was followed from the station and robbed. There were also two incidents of arson, of a bin and of a Ford transit. A ULEZ camera was deliberately damaged. There was an incident where a drug user was searched and a knife, and bladed articles, were found to be in his possession. There was a disturbing incident of an anti-semitic symbol being daubed on a wall outside the synagogue in Cedar Road. There had been a succession of incidents related to a woman living in Cedar Road who had engaged in anti- social activities that had attracted a community of drug users to her premises. This was now the subject of police reports to the DPS that were expected to lead to her being charged with serious offences. SPEEDING The police had been conducting a programme of visits to local care homes and sheltered housing to talk about scams. Residents had raised with them concerns about speeding in Cavendish Road, which had led to police action in that road. There was a discussion of speeding in local roads including Chalgrove Road, Langley Park Road, The Ridgway and Cavendish Road. The police had been carrying out speed checks in Chalgrove Road and Cavendish Road. The action in Cavendish Road had led to twelve drivers receiving warnings. The police would consider further action against speeding in local roads, subject to resources.\nOTHER MATTERS DISCUSSED Staffing levels: There should be in theory be a third officer on the Ward to support Robyn and Helen, but they were coping. The number of “extractions” when they were called away to join police exercises elsewhere in London, or at the Croydon custody suite, remained an issue of concern but was now running close to 35% of their time rather than the 50% it had once been. Mention was made of local concern about a story that a body had been discovered at a house in Egmont Road. The police assured the meeting that there was no wider implication of this incident. The next meeting was tentatively scheduled for Wednesday 14 May at Devonshire Avenue school (7pm) subject to the police checking their work rota. The meeting thanked Robyn for coming back from leave to attend the meeting and thanked the officers for their work for the community in dealing with crime in the Ward. The meeting thanked Fiona Ostler for letting us meet at the school. The date of the next meeting was provisionally set as Wednesday 14 May, at Devonshire Avenue primary school and thought continues to be given to what could be done to better publicise the meeting and get a better attendance.\nConstable Skivens, Louise, Trish and Richard with other Ward police officers at the Sutton South Hello Christmas party\nThe Phoenix Concert Band – which is based in our Ward and for which Richard plays trumpet – were busy over the Christmas period raising money for the Mayor of Sutton’s charity appeal. The band practices every Friday in the church at Christchurch in Christchurch Park. A concert in the church, staged by the band in December, drew an audience of over a hundred and raised £790 for the charity appeal. The band also played Christmas carols at an event in the Straw cafe in Manor Park in December, which raised £360. On the last Saturday before Christmas the band joined a wider group of musicians to play Christmas carols in the atrium of the St Nicholas shopping centre in Sutton (see photo) which raised £180, so £1330 in all. We were grateful to the Mayor, Councillor Colin Stears, who attended all these events. In addition the band played a concert at the Friends’ Meeting House in Cedar Road on the second Saturday in December, to entertain an enthusiastic audience before the “Second Saturday Tea” which the Quakers provide every month on the second Saturday. The Mayor of Sutton’s charities are Home-Start, Sutton, and Sutton, Kingston and Epsom – Parkinson’s UK. Our contribution to the appeal was dwarfed by the £10 000 prize for second place in the boroughs’ competition won by the Sutton float in the London New Year’s Day parade.\nWe pride ourselves on the fact that we have a network of dedicated volunteers who deliver our “FOCUS” magazine throughout the Ward. If you have the odd half hour a few times a year to support us in this way please contact us. We recently prepared an end of year newsletter to update our volunteer deliverers on our activities. We thought we would share it with those who look at our website.\n“The last year has been our most successful year in Sutton South Ward. With the election of Luke as our Member of Parliament in July we have, for the first time, three Liberal Democrat Councillors representing our Ward and a Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament representing us at Westminster. We held a successful Ward meeting on 28 November where we heard from Luke on the incredibly busy life he now has as our Member of Parliament. He has been meeting all the important community groups in Sutton and Cheam, and has made speeches in Parliament on a variety of issues – ranging from the importance of support for carers to the future of Taiwan. In his maiden speech he spoke about what a pleasant place Sutton is to live, work and raise a family, a great change from the previous MP who spent all his time running Sutton down. He is enthusiastic about his role as spokesperson for London. As Ward Councillors, we have a lot of local casework that we deal with and are doing more than our fair bit as Chairs of Council committees – Trish chairing the Audit and Governance Committee, Richard the Planning Committee and Louise combining being chair of the Licensing Committee with her role as Deputy Mayor. This is her second year as Deputy Mayor following the three years during which Trish was Mayor.\nLike every local authority, Sutton Council is pre-occupied by financial issues and struggling with some difficult decisions to balance the books. The decision to close the Registrar’s office (The Russetings) in Worcester Road was one we regretted, driven by a need to consolidate services in fewer buildings, but we believe planning controls are sufficient to protect the appearance of this attractive, locally listed, building in the street scene.\nWe have secured funding for improvements to the WArd, including new information signs at the only open space in our Ward – the Devonshire Avenue Nature Area (DANA). Maintenance of the nature area involves a balance of ensuring it is a peaceful place for people to visit while preserving the biodiversity of the site. There is now a Friends of DANA group – let us know if you would like to join it. We are already looking forward to our next electoral challenge, to retain control of the Council in 2026. We need to keep up the work of talking to our residents, delivering our literature and doorknocking. Let us know if you are interested in being one of our candidates. We welcome talking or corresponding with you and with all our residents. We hope to have further Ward meetings next year. We are really grateful for the help we get.”\nSutton South Councillors were concerned to learn about changes proposed to the organisation of the Police Cadets, who meet at a school in our ward. Currently there are over 120 cadets. However, the decision has been made to close junior cadets and cut the remaining senior cadets to just 46. Their future programme is also being severely curtailed. This will have a major impact on the youth of this borough who will no longer have the opportunity to participate in activities such as camps, parades and Duke of Edinburgh awards.\nCouncillor Louise Phelan, whose son has been a Cadet, commented “I’ve seen first-hand the benefits of being part of police cadets. They learn valuable life skills, and gain self confidence. They also support the local community and get to take part in things they wouldn’t otherwise have had the opportunity to do. For many this is a stepping stone into a career within the police force, for others the Cadets help to keep them on the right path and make better life decisions. I am incredibly concerned others will now not get these opportunities.”",
  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_category_news_page_2/content_156.html": "Richard has been trying to get Network Rail to cut back the vegetation on the railway bank adjacent to the southern bridge in Kings Lane as it obscures sight lines for motorists. Every autumn, after the vegetation on the railway bank has grown up, he has this correspondence with Network Rail. They have now cut back the undergrowth sufficiently for cars to be able to see if there are vehicles coming towards them across the bridge.\nTRISH GETS OUR FOOTBALL TEAM BACK TRAINING IN THE BOROUGH\nThanks to Trish’s hard work, Sutton United football team is back training in the Borough, after two years training near Heathrow. Their new base at the David Weir Leisure Centre from August marks a significant step for both the club and the community.\nThis move, made possible through Trish’s negotiations with Sutton Council, allows players to train locally and to engage more with local residents, something they could not do while training so far away. Players have visited Rosehill Bowling Club to meet residents, reinforcing community ties, and have helped in the campaign led by Trish to re-invigorate the bowling club, which was close to going out of existence. The photos below are of the team at the bowling club.\nTrish is a trustee of Sutton United Football Foundation, whose mission is to support people of all ages and abilities. She emphasises that “Our club’s return to Sutton for training strengthens the team and the bond between sport and our local community”\nSETTING UP THE “FRIENDS OF THE DEVONSHIRE AVENUE NATURE AREA”: WOULD YOU LIKE TO JOIN?\nWe are working with Sutton Council to set up a Friends of Devonshire Avenue Nature Area group.\nWould you like to join it? The nature area is the only open space in our Ward, in an area where many children live in flats without access to a garden. As it is the only open space in our Ward it is precious to us. It is a nature area so requires careful management. To join the Friends group email the Sutton Council officer leading the work, Dawn Fielding\ndawn.fielding@sutton.gov.uk\nWe have secured funding for improvements to the nature area – to the signage and the seating and to clean off the graffiti. On 18 October last year the three Councillors met with several Council officers from the Parks Department at the Nature Area to discuss improvements to the area, and we subsequently took proposals to the local committee to obtain funding for improvement work. On 23 January we met with the volunteers from Sutton Nature Conservation Volunteers who were engaged in necessary maintenance activities at the site. There is discussion about how to best use the area, protect biodiversity (such as the rare “ivy broomrape” which is found in the nature area) while keeping it well used by residents, reduce litter and graffiti, and whether it should be locked at night. Please contact us with your views and to join the Friends group.\nWhile the Nature Reserve is the only open space in our Ward two parks are adjacent – Warren Park at the north eastern boundary of the Ward and Overton Park at the south western boundary. There are also steps being taken to establish Friends groups for these parks, in particular Warren Park. If you live close to one of these parks and would like to join the Friends group contact Dawn Fielding\ndawn.fielding@sutton.gov.uk\nA CLEAN SWEEP FOR THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS IN SUTTON SOUTH WARD\nMEASURING TRAFFIC IN OUR WARD\nIt is some years since we have last had an exercise to measure the volume and speed of traffic in our Ward. The last time this happened it enabled us to introduce some measures to calm traffic in Cavendish Road. From Monday 19th February the tubes seen in this picture taken in The Ridgway, integral to traffic measurement equipment, appeared in many local roads at the eastern end of the Ward. The tubes collected data for seven days on the volume, speed and classification of vehicles.\nThe results of the exercise are listed below. The results have not led to some “standout” conclusion as to a problem that needs tackling. Traffic officers are examining three main issues:\n- whether action can be taken to improve the safety and the experience of pedestrians crossing the Kings Lane bridge without closing the road to vehicles. The bridge is narrow. Installing a second bridge would be impossibly expensive. Marking a pedestrian path at one side of the road might be feasible\n- similarly, whether something can be done to improve the safety and the experience of pedestrians passing under the railway bridge in Langley Park Road\n- possible improvements to the busy junction where Cedar Road crosses Langley Park Road.\nYour views on these issues, and views on any other traffic and parking issues you would like us to look at, are invited.\nThe traffic survey yielded three pieces of data on traffic movements at 17 locations in the part of Sutton South Ward east of Brighton Road. The survey was undertaken in February 2024 over a seven day period Monday to Saturday. The three pieces of data are:\n- the percentage of vehicle traffic that was heavy goods vehicles (HGVs)\n- the average speed of traffic, and\n- the average daily flow of vehicles over the seven day period.\nThe 17 traffic measurement stations are listed here, with the three pieces of data in each direction of the road, in an approximate order from north to south of the Ward, taking roads to the west of the Ward and then listing roads further east.\nKINGS LANE (Southernmost bridge)\nNorth 5.1 / 14.2 / 1350 South 6.7 / 13.9 /1119\nHILLCROOME ROAD\nEast 7.7 / 19.8 /1034 West 4.2 / 18.4 / 808\nLANGLEY PARK ROAD (at the railway bridge)\nNorth 6.9 /21.6 / 3749 South 7.0 / 22,2 / 3059\nBRIGHTON ROAD (at the junction with The Quadrant)\nNorth 8.4 / 17.9 / 6807 South 7.5 / 18.3 / 8508\nBRIGHTON ROAD (just south of the junction with Christchurch Park)\nNorth 8.5 / 25.5 / 8421 South 8.6 / 24.6 / 7599\nCEDAR ROAD (between the junctions with Brighton Road and with Langley Park Road)\nEast 8.3 / 17.8 / 2727 West 7.5 / 18.7 / 1936\nLANGLEY PARK ROAD (just north of the junction with Cavendish Road)\nNorth 5.6 / 22.4 /3034 South 5.8 / 21.3 / 3043\nLANGLEY PARK ROAD (just south of the junction with Chalgrove Road)\nNorth 8.5 / 22.0 / 1697 South 8.2 / 21,0 / 1843\nCAVENDISH ROAD\nEast 9.9 / 19.3 / 648 West 8.7 / 21.2 / 878\nCHRISTCHURCH PARK\nEast 6.0 / 22.2 / 424 West 5.7 / 23,1 / 667\nDEVONSHIRE AVENUE (one way street)\nEast 5.8 / 18.7 / 622\nMAYFIELD ROAD\nNorth 6.8 / 25.0 / 616 South 6.4 / 23.6 / 332\nTHE RIDGWAY (north of junction with Farm Road)\nNorth 6.2 / 24.3 /324 South 5.1 / 24.2 / 349\nTHE RIDGWAY SOUTH and CHALGROVE ROAD\nNorth 5.9 / 25.1 / 571 South 5.9 / 25.1 / 545\nFARM ROAD\nEast 5.0 / 21.2 / 869 West 4.9 / 20.4 / 994\nUPLAND ROAD\nNorth 5.2 / 21.3 / 263 South 11.3 / 25.8 / 293\nDOWNSIDE ROAD\nEast 6.7 / 19.2 / 1089 West 5.9 / 20.8 / 1147\nNEW RESPONSIBILITIES FOR TRISH, RICHARD AND LOUISE\nFollowing the Annual Council Meeting, held on 20 May 2024, where membership of Council committees is decided, Trish, Richard and Louise continue to have important new responsibilities. Louise is continuing for a second year as our Deputy Mayor. Sutton South Councillors have made a major contribution to the Mayoralty, as prior to Louise accepting this role Trish was Mayor of Sutton for three years. Richard was Mayor of Sutton in 2016-17. Louise is now combining this role with being Chair of the Licensing Committee, and is a member of the important Housing, Economy and Business Committee.\nTrish continues as Chair of the important Audit and Governance Committee and is a member of the important Environment and Sustainable Transport Committee. Richard will continue as Chair of the Council’s Planning Committee.\nTHE MUSIC HAS TO STOP AT SPAGHETTI TREE\nOn 14 May a sub-committee of Sutton Council’s Licensing Committee considered a string of complaints by local residents about noise nuisance from the Spaghetti Tree restaurant in Brighton Road. As the restaurant is in our Ward, none of the Ward Councillors could sit as members of the sub-committee, as those taking the decision must be independent from any local influence. The committee considered whether this anti-social behaviour, involving the frequent playing of music at loud volume and thus disturbing local residents, was a breach of the licence conditions for regulated entertainment that governed the operation of the restaurant. The committee was concerned about the disturbance and decided to vary the licence of the restaurant to prevent the playing of live and recorded music as regulated entertainment at the premises. The owner has 21 days to appeal against the decision.\nThis is sad – but the owners of premises must recognise that licence conditions are imposed to protect the local residents and they will be enforced, so they cannot be ignored without there being consequences.\nADVANCES IN OUR WARD\nWe are always seeking ways to improve the quality of life locally. The defibrillator installed in Brighton Road outside Northumberland House, pictured above, is a potentially important facility, but we were disturbed to learn that the one at the railway station a few hundred metres north of this location has been stolen. Action is in hand to replace it.\nMany new street trees have been planted in the Ward including, in the recent period, new trees in Farm Road, Devonshire Avenue, Effingham Close, Prior Avenue and Kayemoor Road, adding to the pleasant, green, suburban feel of our Ward. We are delighted that the tree that had to be felled in Brighton Road, outside Northumberland House, as it was diseased, has been replaced, thanks to funding we obtained from the Council’s Public Realm budget.\nThe fencing in The Quadrant, nearby, which had become damaged has been repaired, also with funding we obtained from the Public Realm budget.\nIn addition, Sutton Council was delighted to be successful in obtaining funding to upgrade rail services to Belmont Station. The funding will allow train services to double from two to four trains per hour and will also facilitate improvements to the station. This will improve transport to the Cancer Hub.\nMORE APPLICATIONS FOR EXTRA STOREYS\nThe owners of Harrow Lodge, 28 Eaton Road, have used a device known as “Prior Approval” to obtain planning permission to extend the building – adding a storey to the top of the building, with some other changes. This will add 10 new flats to the building. In Mulgrave Road the owners of The Rowans, 47 Mulgrave Road, have similarly obtained planning application to add 8 new flats by adding two storeys to the top of the building. This is a current trend – to add extra storeys to the top of blocks of flats.\nThe applicants both used a device in national planning law known as “Prior Approval” which means that Councillors cannot take the application to the Council’s Planning Committee. We consider that this procedure was introduced to undermine the planning system and reduce local control of planning decisions. We are not able to stop these changes taking place as the system means the application has to be assessed by Council officers against a narrow set of criteria and if the application is refused the Planning Inspectorate, based in Bristol, has the power to over-ride local decisions.\nAs your local Councillors, we are concerned about these developments. While there is a need for more accommodation, these changes will involve building work that will impact on residents. However we seek to ensure that conditions are stipulated in any planning permission, if it is granted, to protect the peace and quiet of the residents during construction work. These include that access to the roof should be via an external hoist, the interior of the building should not be a storage area or building site, there should be a construction management plan, the contractors should join the Considerate Contractors’ Scheme, and there should be a liaison officer residents can contact. If scaffolding is erected it should only be erected when needed and removed as soon as it is not needed.\nA similar application for extra storeys on the roof of the building at Chelsea Court in Mulgrave Road was turned down on the basis of our representations that it would have made the building look incongruous.\nWe welcome feedback on your views on planning proposals. You can see the details of and comment on planning applications via the Sutton Council website (go to the section on planning) or comment by post to\nDevelopment Management, Civic Offices, St Nicholas Way, Sutton, SM1 1EA.\nNEW HOMES LOCALLY TO MEET THE HOUSING CRISIS\nOn 30 November Richard and Trish sat as members of the Council’s Planning Committee, with Richard chairing the meeting, to consider the fate of the B and Q site in central Sutton. This is just outside our Ward. B and Q plan to close the store next June. Richard commented that, though he is no do-it-yourself fanatic, he regretted the closure of the store, but B and Q say it no longer makes them money and they have decided to close.\nIt is inevitable that the site will be developed as housing. There is no demand for new office space (more people work at home) or new shops (more people shop using the internet) but there is a housing crisis. On the day of the discussion 970 Sutton families were homeless and living in bed and breakfast accommodation, at the expense of the Council and thus our Council tax payers. More homes are desperately needed. The philosophy in the Sutton local plan is to meet our housing targets partly through a more intensive area of development close to the town centre and near the railway station. As public transport links are good in this area it is possible to envisage a car free or “car light” development – if you have to provide a parking space for every house many fewer homes can be built. This reduces development pressure on the borough’s suburban heartland and Green Belt areas. Planning Committee often considers proposals to build on the Green Belt which we resist, but the new homes must go somewhere. The more intensive development in the town centre will inevitably include some tall buildings, and there is a cluster close to the railway station.\nEvidence was presented to the committee on action taken to deal with some of the consequences of this development, such as a need for places in local schools, demands on health services and additional strain on water and sewage systems. Richard commented that there were attractive features to the proposed development, 60% of which would be open space, including an area of public parkland, a water feature, an amphitheatre and terraced roof gardens. The most important aspect, though, was the plan for 337 “affordable” homes where Sutton Council can place the most deserving of the 2 600 families on the housing register. This will include families that are homeless or those we meet, in our Ward, who are living in dreadful housing circumstances – sometimes families with three or four children living together in tiny flats.\nThe planning application was approved. Initially all that local people will observe is the closure of the store, hoardings put up round the site and the store demolished. Then there will be building work but it will be several years before anyone moves in. Eventually, it will be an attractive, landscaped site. On the website\nthere is a video of a walk through a CGI representation of what the final product will look like.",

To ensure a consistent approach throughout the Borough, all local schemes will be drawn into a central strategy and progressed on the basis of an assessment of priorities.\nAn ambitious scheme for the introduction of a 20mph scheme across most of the area of Sutton South Ward west of the Sutton to Belmont railway line has now been included in the “Local Implementation Plan” prepared by Transport for London. This was the subject of proposals put to the local committee in 2015. However, it is on the “reserve list” which means that implementation in the near future is most unlikely.\nA parking scheme for the newly-named Berridge Close is agreed, implementation to coincide with the opening of the adjacent Subsea7 building, as this will lead to more intensive use of the road by those working in the building and accessing the underground car park. Obstructive parking in Berridge Close could lead to problems when the building is occupied, so needs to be avoided. It is proposed that the road will be included in the controlled parking zone with four parking bays in the road, reserved for residents with parking permits. Completion of the building is unlikely before December.\nTraffic and parking schemes were the subject of a session at the December 2015 meeting of the South Sutton, Cheam and Belmont Local Committee, when residents noted down parking and traffic problems. A list of the proposals raised by residents was reported back to the local committee meeting on 10 March.\nIn relation to our own area, the proposals fell into three main categories.\nFirst, concerns about intensive and sometimes obstructive parking in Mayfield Road and roads nearby (The Ridgway, Chalgrove Road, Upland Road).\nSecond, concerns about visibility at the Farm Road / The Ridgway junction.\nThird, a set of other concerns, mostly about speeding at various locations.\nThis listing will form the agenda for further work by the traffic department within a wider cross-Borough study, which is centrally managed by the Council. A number of minor, initial proposals were agreed on 10 March, including to restrict parking at the Prior Avenue / Banstead Road junction due to visibility issues.\nThe question of a parking control scheme in Mayfield Road and the surrounding area was the subject of a consultation exercise by local Councillors last year which showed support in Mayfield Road but not adjacent roads. On 10 March the local committee agreed to devote some of its public realm funds to fund the traffic department to “kick start” a study of potential for parking controls in this area. A discussion between traffic engineers and Ward Councillors to consider this study was held on 8 June in Mayfield Road. The traffic engineers will design a parking control scheme for consultation. The precise parameters of this scheme and the consultation have yet to be finalised. Consultation with residents is due to begin in January 2017.\nSome residents of Audley Place have commented to us that there is difficulty when driving out of Audley Place in seeing vehicles coming down Camborne Road, if cars are parked close to the corner. We raised this issue with traffic engineers and the Council is proposing a small extension of the yellow lines on each side at the exit from Audley Place. We think this will do the trick in terms of making it easier, and safer, to drive out into Camborne Road.\nResidents of Tapestry Close have complained to us about obstructive parking in the Close. We raised this issue with traffic engineers and a scheme of yellow lining was proposed. Further consultation with residents, required by law, found some residents objecting and this scheme is currently on hold.\nSeveral schemes consulted on some time ago have now been implemented, including yellow lining at the bottom of Downside Road to deal with obstructive parking (see photo above) and switching some “pay and display” bays to “dual use” so residents with parking permits can use them, in Grange Road and Langley Park Road.",
  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_sutton-south-hello/content_52.html": "[ This photo is of me playing the Last Post at the Remembrance Sunday service at the Cheam war memorial in 2022 ]\nHERE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS I HAVE BEEN DOING IN THE MOST RECENT PAST AS YOUR COUNCILLOR. I REGARD THIS BLOG AS A WAY OF REPORTING BACK.\nI am now into my fifteenth year as a local Councillor – where do the years go? I was first elected in 2010, having contested Sutton South Ward unsuccessfully in 2006. I was re-elected in 2014 and then again in 2018 and 2022. I take some pride in this. The fact that I lost in 2006 shows defeat is possible. Having an election every four years, if you are the sitting Ward Councillor, is like having a test where your residents can either say you are doing a good job or throw you out. So far I have passed the test each time.\nI spend a significant proportion of every day dealing with some aspect of my responsibilities as a Councillor, in particular local casework. My principal contribution to Sutton’s civic administration, now, is that I chair the Planning Committee.\nThis is my latest responsibility. Over my years as a Councillor I have had a succession of jobs. For the two years to May 2016 I was Chair of the Planning Committee and lead member on human resources – which carried with it chairing the Council and Employees’ Joint Committee and the health and safety committee. I also sat on the important Strategy and Resources Committee. On 23 May 2016 I was elected Mayor and gave up these responsibilities to concentrate on Mayoral duties. I stood down as Mayor on 22 May 2017, a date etched on my memory as the following day my eldest daughter, Jane, was admitted to St Christopher’s hospice in Sydenham where she died shortly afterwards of a brain tumour.\nFollowing my re-election in May 2018 I took up the post of Chair of the Audit and Governance Committee, a new committee formed by the merger of the audit committee and the standards committee. I was yet again appointed Chair of the Council and Employees Joint Committee and the Health and Safety committee. In May 2019 I stood down as Chair of the Audit and Governance Committee. I continued to chair the Council and Employees Joint Committee and represent the Council on the Greater London Employment Forum, which discusses employment matters in London with recognised trade unions. I was again appointed to the Planning Committee, which I used to chair, and the Housing, Economy and Business Committee, of which I was once vice-chair. After the election in 2022 I again took up the role as Chair of the Planning Committee, retaining my duties as chair of the Council and Employees Joint Committee (which has now absorbed the duties of the separate health and safety committee) and leader of the Liberal Democrat delegation to the Greater London Employment Forum.\nSubsequently there have been further changes in committee membership and I am now, in addition to being Chair of Planning Committee, a member of the Licensing Committee and a member of the Pensions Committee.\nBelow are some highlights of my work, mixed in with a bit of personal information. But do have a look at the page “Who are we?” for some biographical information on who I am and what I stand for.\nApril 2025. A very busy start to the month with a week when all the main Council committees I am on met. I went to Pensions Committee on Tuesday (1 April), Planning Committee on the Wednesday and the South Sutton, Cheam and Belmont Local Committee on the Thursday. My other big activity this week was to do some canvassing in Sutton Central Ward for the by-election.\nThe result of the by-election was extraordinary. It is not often that your candidate gets more votes than all the other six candidates added together. Our man, Richard Choi, won with 1291 votes and the candidate who came second – the Conservative – only got 327. Reform got a significant number of votes (282) and pushed Labour, who came second in this Ward in 2022 and may have seen it as a target seat, into fourth. No joy for the Greens, the Christian People’s Alliance and the “independent” group on Sutton Council, each of whose candidates got less than a hundred votes.\nWhy do we call this activity “canvassing” ? The previous week end I visited my daughter in Birmingham and we went to Hanbury Hall, a National Trust property. Apparently in the 18th century a candidate standing for Parliament – lacking modern technology – would commission a local artist to paint a poster with his portrait on it. When addressing public meetings he would unfurl and display this canvas. It seems that this is where the expression “canvassing for votes” comes from. I came across this rare example of such a canvas at Hanbury Hall. Thomas Vernon, a Whig politician, stood for Worcestershire in 1714.\nMarch 2025. An emotional start to the month. The Phoenix band (for which I play trumpet) provided the music at an event, held at Christchurch in Christchurch Park, to mark the sad anniversary of the invasion of Ukraine. No-one could have envisaged, when we first were involved in planning the event last October, what a terrible moment this would be for Ukraine after the disgraceful behaviour of Trump and Vance the previous day. It was an emotional event. I thought the music was great – both the Ukrainian choirs and our band. My wife Gloria joined the choir.\nOn 3 March the Council discussed and agreed the budget for the coming year. I felt this was a good debate. I made what I thought a good speech, that was well received, on homelessness, which is the subject of a post on the main site.\nOn the 23rd I took part in a vigil for peace organised by the Quakers in Trinity Square in Sutton. This was quite moving and came at a point where I feel despair over the situation in Ukraine and Gaza. The month ended, for me, on a more hopeful note with the family news that my nine year old grandson has passed his grade 1 trombone exam with a merit. I play some duets with him – myself on cornet, he on trombone. I am sure he is playing the part better than I am.\nFebruary 2025. The month began with a busy week of Council meetings. On the 5th we had Planning Committee. We had the unusual experience of re-examining a decision taken some time ago to reject an application for extra care beds in Woodcote Grove as changes to the National Planning Policy Framework meant we were likely to lose the appeal. We decided not to contest the appeal. The following day we had the local committee meeting (the Sutton South, Cheam and Belmont Local Committee) where we were entertained by a local choir that the Council had supported. We also agreed to replace two benches in the Ward that have deteriorated, one in Copse Hill and one in The Ridgway at the junction with Mayfield Road.\nOn 15 February Gloria and I went to the annual dinner of the London Mayors’ Association held in a building adjacent to the National Liberal Club in central London. There was a good turnout of past and present Sutton Mayors.\nJanuary 2025. A peaceful start to the New Year with the January meeting of Planning Committee cancelled for lack of business. Consequently I was able to get to the quarterly meeting of the Mitcham Common Conservators, which was scheduled for the same evening. This was an interesting meeting at which I raised the question of fencing part of the common to graze sheep. Gloria and I often go for a walk on Banstead Downs and the Banstead Downs Conservators graze sheep on the downs during the winter. However, there would be difficulties in doing the same on Mitcham Common. On the 15th we had our quarterly public meeting with the local police, at Devonshire Avenue school, on which I have posted a report on the main website. Again, a very small attendance. Crime remains low. perhaps that is why there is such low interest.\nOn the 27th Council met. I asked a question about the reasons why a recent survey by The Times newspaper ranked Sutton as the eighth most attractive place to live in England. This does not surprise me – when doorknocking, I find people generally say they really like Sutton (a strong sense of community, open spaces, low crime, good schools, convenient for London and for the countryside). This is particularly the case with people who have moved to Sutton from elsewhere, particularly those from Hong Kong and from Ukraine.\nDecember 2024. The month started with Planning Committee, where we agreed a retrospective application, deferred from the November meeting, for some minor variations from the original planning permission (granted in 2016) in respect of the New Mill Quarter estate. I went to have a look at the estate and was impressed. On 6 December I took a training course by video on safeguarding. This was required by the Lawn Tennis Association to enable me to continue my role as Safeguarding Officer for the nearby tennis club. The other requirement was to renew my DBS certificate, and on the same day this came through.\nOn the 7th I helped raise money for the Mayor of Sutton’s charity appeal by organising a group of musicians to play Christmas carols in the Straw cafe in Sutton, in Manor Park. Sadly the weather was poor so we only had a small crowd. However, the event raised £380 for the Mayor’s charity appeal.\nA lot of Council committees seem to have meetings just before Christmas. On 10 December there was the Pensions Committee. On the following evening Scrutiny Committee, where we had an interesting discussion of flooding with representatives of Thames Water.\nOn 13 December I played (trumpet) in a concert given by the Phoenix Concert Band at Christchurch, the church where we regularly practice, in Christchurch Park. This was attended by the Mayor of Sutton and raised almost £800 for his charity appeal. The programme was varied, ranging from an arrangement of the music from Porgy and Bess to an arrangement of Bad Romance (a Lady Gaga number). There was a lot of Christmassy music including an arrangement of White Christmas and the famous Christmas Festival arrangement of Christmas music by Leroy Anderson. The following day the band played a concert at the Friends’ Meeting House in Cedar Road and the following Saturday we joined a larger group of musicians to play Christmas carols in the atrium of the St Nicholas centre (see photo below) to facilitate a collection for the Mayor’s charity appeal. So we raised over £1330 for the appeal – to support Home-Start, Sutton, and the local branch of Parkinson’s UK.\nNovember 2024. On 5 November I went to the Devonshire Avenue Nature Area, the only open space in our Ward, with my fellow Sutton South Councillors, to help the Sutton Nature Conservation Volunteers in tidying up the area and hacking back the undergrowth. We do this a couple of times each year.\nOn the 6th Planning Committee met. I was concerned that the agenda included consideration of an application regarding the Felnex site in Hackbridge but no representative of the applicant attended the committee. I proposed we defer the item, which was agreed. We agreed a proposal for a block of flats in Wallington and an important application to re-configure the Goat Road junction on Mitcham Common.\nThe following weekend was Remembrance weekend. I had the privilege of playing the Last Post at a short ceremony outside Wallington Old Town Hall on the Saturday, and on Sunday played trumpet with the Phoenix concert band at the Remembrance Sunday event at the war memorial in Belmont. It was a bit chilly but I thought we played well. The music included Nimrod, the British Legion March and Moonlight Serenade.\nOn the 14th. I attended the AGM of the only company of which I am a Director – Highfield Lawns Ltd. This company owns the tennis courts opposite my house and its only function is to enable the tennis club to continue by charging it a peppercorn rent. It also ensures the tennis courts are not built on. It has never declared a dividend to shareholders.\nOctober 2024. The month usually begins with a meeting of Planning Committee on the first Wednesday. However, it was cancelled due to lack of business. When I was first elected in 2010 the committee met fortnightly and could not keep up with the business. Now, it has much less business due to the changes in what is permitted development and the introduction of the “quickie” “prior approval” route to get planning permission. I regard these changes as reducing oversight of development and cannot say I welcome them.\nSo the month began with a meeting of the Pensions Committee. This is a committee of Councillors that oversees the pension fund of the Council, which pays pensions to retired employees of the Council and some other associated bodies. As a retired civil servant, it always strikes me as a point of interest that every local authority in the land has its own pension scheme. There is a single pension scheme for civil servants. Higher rates of return on investments might be possible if the authorities pooled investments. This is now, to some extent, being done across London authorities and one of our agenda items was a report on the progress made.\nOn 21 October there was a meeting of Council. There was, in my view, insufficient attention paid by Councillors to the size of the agenda and the need to get through the business. Discussion of the final items on the agenda was abbreviated and I did not get to make the speech I had prepared on the European Environmental Safety Directives. On 24 October I went to a meeting held at Sutton FC to hear a talk by Helen Maguire, the newly elected MP for Epsom and Ewell. I was fascinated to learn she has a background of service in the Military Police, including in Iraq, an untypical background for a LibDem MP. On 27 October I went to the Diamond Riding Centre, half an hour’s walk from where I live, to play trumpet for the Allegra Concert Band at a concert to raise money for the centre. I understand we raised over £400. Our programme included the music from The King and I, from Jersey Boys, and a great arrangement of the music of John Williams (Star Wars etc.). On 28 October I attended a board meeting of Sutton South Hello, an important organisation in my Ward that provides opportunities for the socially isolated to meet.\nSeptember 2024. A major commitment for me during the school summer holidays is to look after my grandson. On Tuesday 3 September we went to the Oval to see Surrey beat Durham in a 20-20 quarter final match. This was one of the best cricket matches I have seen this summer. He went back to school on 5 September.\nCouncil business began the following evening, on 4 September, with the monthly meeting of the Planning Committee. We agreed an outline application for re-development of the Elm Grove estate in central Sutton. This will return to committee when plans are more concrete. The only resident of Elm Grove who asked to speak to the committee strongly supported the proposal.\nOn 15 September I attended the annual “inspection” of Mitcham Common, required by the statute setting up the Mitcham Common Conservators. Part of the common is in Sutton. I am a Mitcham Common Conservator.\nOn 23 September I attended a “Walkabout” inspection of Sutton Court, one of the social housing estates in our Ward.\nOn 25 September I attended the quarterly open meeting with our Ward police officers. A note of this meeting is on a separate page dealing with policing matters. The key point to note was the Ward remains a low-crime area, though every crime is a a matter of concern and we are never complacent.\nAugust 2024. August is usually a quiet month for Council activities, though I seem to have quite a lot of casework with residents on at the moment. I do not discuss this casework in this blog as it is a confidential matter between myself, often my fellow Ward Councillors, and the resident or group of residents concerned. The one Council committee meeting I have attended this month was Planning Committee, which concerned a disputed proposal for a new Macdonalds restaurant in Wallington. Planning law requires that each application is approached by Councillors with an open mind, so there is no political “whipping” of members to support a certain line. No-one can doubt that this happens in practice as there was a lot of cross-party voting on this application and I was in the minority in supporting the recommendation of officers.\nI have had a relaxing month after the hard work of the (successful) General Election campaign. I am a member of Surrey County Cricket Club and have watched some cricket at the Oval. My least liked form of cricket is The Hundred but I go to watch the games if it is a pleasant and dry evening, as getting in costs nothing if you are a Member and travel is free due to the wonders of the Freedom Pass (if, like me, you are 77 years old). On our 54th wedding anniversary on 8 August Gloria and I went for an excellent meal at a Michelin starred restaurant (St Barts) in the City. On 11 August I played third trumpet for the Allegra concert band on the bandstand at Clapham Common. Our programme included the Dam Busters march, an excellent arrangement of pieces composed by John Williams (Star Wars etc.), the music from Fiddler On The Roof, from the film Aladdin, and from Jersey Boys (Big Girls Don’t Cry etc.).\nJuly 2024. The month has begun with the resounding victory of the Liberal Democrats locally in the General Election. It has been a great result for the party with 72 Liberal Democrat MPs elected to the new Parliament. These include our two victorious candidates in the two constituencies that make up the London borough of Sutton. I spent a lot of time canvassing and delivering literature in support of Luke Taylor, our candidate in the Sutton and Cheam constituency. I am delighted that he is now Luke Taylor MP.\nThe calling of the election for 4 July meant that the meeting of Planning Committee due to be held on 3 July was postponed a week. This caused me a problem as I had arranged a week’s holiday that week, visiting Reykjavic in Iceland. My vice-chair, Councillor McCoy, chaired the meeting in my absence. From 16 to 19 July my wife Gloria and I took part in a Civic visit, or study tour, with the London Mayors’ Association to Lille, Arras and Douai, where we met the Mayors of these towns (or city in the case of Lille). These were very interesting visits. Lest anyone reading this gets the impression these were jaunts at public expense, there was no element of subsidy and we all had to meet the full costs of the visit.\nJune 2024. The general election has been called for 4 July ! I will be fully involved in work related to the election and not adding to this blog till it is over. Council committee meetings are cancelled for June – except for Planning Committee as there are statutory deadlines to be observed. So the one Council commitment I have had in the month was to chair Planning Committee on 5 June. On 8 June there was an event to remember D-Day at the Cheam War Memorial where I was invited to play the Last Post..\nMay 2024. The month began with the local elections on 2 May. Nationally, the LibDems have done well, gaining seats and winning more seats than the Tories. Our Mayoral candidate finished ahead of the Greens and Reform. We maintained our two seats on the Greater London Authority and, for the first time, won a constituency seat (in South West London, broadly Richmond and Kingston). Trish was our constituency candidate and increased our vote in the Croydon and Sutton constituency.\nThe Sutton Council by-election produced what must have been the only Conservative gain from Labour in the whole of England. The by-election was triggered by the resignation of one of the three Labour Councillors for reasons that remain unclear. This result is undoubtedly attributable to the special circumstances of ULEZ. This does not alter the “balance of power” on Sutton Council where the LibDems continue to have a majority of three over all other parties.\nMay 13 was local AGMs day – the Sutton South Neighbourhood Association met in the afternoon for their AGM at Christchurch, the Highfields Residents’ Association met in the evening for their AGM at the tennis club pavilion opposite my house. At both meetings I reflected that they had attracted more people in earlier years.\nOn May 14 I attended a meeting of the Licensing Committee at which the owner of the Spaghetti Tree in Brighton Road was taken to task over complaints of loud music disturbing the neighbourhood over a prolonged period, and despite warnings. His licence was modified to prevent him doing this. Unfortunate – but a salutary lesson that these licence conditions are there for a purpose, to protect local residents, and they will be enforced.\nApril 2024. The 3rd of April was a busy day in relation to my responsibilities as chair of Planning Committee. In the morning I attended a public hearing on an appeal against a decision we took to turn down an application for a substantial development on Green Belt land, based on an argument that this was a care home. I dislike a system whereby the remote Planning Inspectorate in Bristol can overturn local democratic decisions. Our officers gave a good account of themselves. We await the outcome. That evening Planning Committee considered three interesting applications. The most significant decisions were to endorse a tree preservation order to protect a beautiful tree in Carshalton from being chopped down and to turn down an application to re-develop the pharmacy building in Carshalton. I thought the design of the proposed building unacceptable. The big event for me so far this month is that on 11 April I went to The Barbican to hear Alison Balsom play Wynton Marsalis’s trumpet concerto. Wynton was in the audience. It was fabulous – but I sometimes reflect that hearing these great musicians makes me consider giving up my own pathetic efforts to play the trumpet.\nWork is building up for the Mayoral and Greater London Authority (GLA) elections on 2 May, together with a Council by-election in St Helier West on the same day.\nOn April 24 there was a further meeting of the police consultative panel, held at Devonshire Avenue school. Burglaries were up but thefts of and from motor vehicles down. No thefts of catalytic converters for about a year.\nMarch 2024. The month began with the Council meeting on 4 March where we adopted the budget for the next year. With so many Councils going bust or in dire straits, we are surviving, but it is difficult and we are being driven back to asking what we can afford above the statutory minima. Trish and I both spoke – Trish on the audit and governance function (she chairs the Audit and Governance Committee) and I on homelessness. This is a particular interest due to the work history of my daughter Ellie, and because as chair of Planning Committee I have a role in increasing the supply of affordable housing.\nThe following day I attended the first day of a public enquiry into a decision of the Planning Committee to reject an application for a major development on Green Belt at Woodcote Grove. I have taken a great dislike to these applicants and I hope the decision goes the right way. I learned later that the applicants, clearly recognising that they were losing the argument, tried to get the Inspector removed. The hearing was then suspended till September. What a farce! The day after, 6 March, Planning Committee met.\nOn Friday 8th Gloria travelled to Armagh to visit the Observatory there with a group from the Scientific Instruments Society, an international society of which she is President. I stayed home to play (trumpet) in a concert at Redhill on the Saturday. On the 13th I attended a meeting of the Housing, Economy and Business Committee where we considered a report on the work of Sutton Housing Partnership, meeting their Board members. On the 20th I attended a meeting of the Mitcham Common Conservators.\nThe resignation of Ruth Dombey as Leader of the Council has been announced. She has been a very capable and inspiring leader. She has excellent judgement and a wonderful ability to put our policies into words all can understand. She will be missed. Councillor Lewis is an excellent successor and will grow into the job.\nFebruary 2024. A great start to the month with the “Safari Supper” organised by my local residents’ association. Twenty one couples took part. You cook one course and go to other people’s houses for the other courses. A great idea. On the 7th there was a meeting of Planning Committee, unusually and by accident a “themed” meeting in that both applications we considered related to educational facilities for children with special educational needs. We passed both applications. The following day our local committee met, by video. I do not think a video meeting is a good idea for this type of committee. On 10 February Gloria and I attended the London Mayors’ Association annual dinner, at the Royal Horseguards hotel in London. An excellent meal. But not a cheap event so we may not get there next year.\nOn 20 February the three Councillors attended a review meeting where architects “peer reviewed” proposals for the conversion of Quadrant House from being an office block to being flats. The logic is unassailable – there is a housing crisis but little demand for office space in an era when so many work from home. But I was not keen on some aspects of these proposals.\nOn 24 February Trish and I attended an event organised by the Ukranian community in our Ward to note with sadness the second anniversary of the Russian invasion. On the 25th I played cornet for the Crystal Palace Brass Band Progress Band in a music contest in Bromley, where we played well and won a cup. One piece we played was the famous Shostakovitch Waltz.\nJanuary 2024. A busy start to the year, though the monthly meeting of Planning Committee which is always on the first Wednesday of each month was cancelled due to lack of pressing business. The 17th was a busy day with a meeting at the Devonshire Avenue Nature Area with Council officers and a local resident to discuss the setting up of a “Friends of Devonshire Avenue Nature Area” group. That evening there was a meeting of the Housing, Economy and Business Committee which discussed important proposals to get some local projects back on track after they had been disrupted by the private sector contractors leading them going bust. We also discussed the rental charges for social housing in the borough. The following evening there was a meeting of the Audit and Governance Committee which I attended as a substitute for Councillor McCoy who is unwell. This discussed a disgraceful event where a Councillor (Councillor Mattey) had been found to have breached the Council’s Code of Conduct in relation to some comments regarding Holocaust Memorial Day events but he had refused to apologise for the breach.\nOn the 19th Gloria and I went swimming at the Westcroft baths, something we do every week to keep fit. As old age pensioners, both in our seventies, we have free swimming. I wonder how long this concession can be retained in the light of the financial problems that all local Councils are now having to cope with.\nOn the 19th I was part of a Licensing Sub-Committee considering a licence application for “FeastyFest” in Cheam next summer. We granted the licence. On 26 January I went to the Holocaust Memorial Day event in Sutton library – we remembered the Holocaust and reflected on later events that had led to refugees, including Ukraine, Afghanistan. Nothing was said about Gaza. On the 29th there was a full Council meeting at which, for once, I did not make a speech.\nDecember 2023. A further meeting of Planning Committee, not as dramatic or important as the one we held last Thursday to discuss the future of the B and Q site. Council activities tend to ease off as it gets towards Christmas and my time is increasingly occupied with Christmas carol playing. I played second trumpet for the Phoenix Concert Band on 8 December, a free concert at Christchurch in Christchurch Park with a collection for the Mayor of Sutton’s charities. We collected £442, The following day six of us raised £300 for the charity appeal playing Christmas carols at the Straw cafe in Manor Park. On 13 December all three Councillors went to the Hello Christmas party at Christchurch. As ever, Trish led the dancing.\nOn 16 December I organised a group to play Christmas carols in the St Nicholas shopping Centre. A collection for the Mayor’s charity fund raised £230. Seventeen musicians turned up including trumpets, flutes, clarinets, saxophones, a bass clarinet, a tuba, an electric bass. I am fifth from the left in the photo. So my musician friends raised almost £1 000 for the Mayor’s charity appeal over the Christmas period.\nNovember 2023. The month began with Planning Committee. Just two planning applications to consider, both in Wallington. Sensible decisions were reached but I was disappointed at the behaviour of a Conservative member and had to remind him that the committee treats those who come to speak to us on these applications with courtesy. On the 3rd I attended the tea for “retired folk” organised my local residents’ association – the Highfield Residents’ Association. Although I am 77 years old, am I really “retired” ? I am pretty busy, as readers of this blog will realise. On the 4th Gloria and I went to watch the firework display in Ruskin Park, Carshalton. It was very good. The following day I played cornet for the Crystal Palace Brass Band at a street market in Norwood next to South Norwood cemetery, combining it with a visit to the grave of my daughter Jane, who died of a brain tumour in 2017, in the cemetery. This is her tombstone.\nOn the 9th I travelled to Reading to have a medical examination by the UK Biobank. This is a research facility. The results of their medical examination go into their research data base. I get no feedback on the results unless I have a serious medical problem that is detected in which case they tell my doctor – not me. On the 12th I played trumpet as part of the Phoenix Concert Band at the Remembrance Day event in Belmont. This was a good event. On the 21st I attended the AGM of Highfield Lawns Ltd., the only company of which I am a Director. The aim of the company is to ensure the open space it owns opposite my house remains a tennis club. On the 28th. I attended a meeting of the Housing, Economy and Building Committee where the sobering news was that there is a big spike in homelessness with 970 Sutton families homeless and in bed and breakfast accommodation that night. This statistic was referred to (by me) two days later when Planning Committee met under my chairmanship and approved development plans for the soon to be redundant B and Q store site, which will provide 337 affordable homes where families from the housing register, in desperate circumstances, will be housed – but not before 2028.\nDUE TO SOME WEBSITE CAPACITY PROBLEMS I HAVE CURRENTLY LOST THE EARLIER MONTH BY MONTH RECORD OF MY ACTIVITIES – I THINK IT DOUBTFUL NOW THAT WE CAN FIX THE PROBLEM\n[…] Sutton South Hello!

The Council agreed a motion directed to the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government calling for a re-think. The motion criticised the proposed extension of permitted development rights and the envisaged interference of the Planning Inspectorate in local decisions on planning applications, affordable housing and section 106 contributions.\nHere is the full text of Richard’s Speech:\n“It is right that the London Borough of Sutton, which has been at the intellectual vanguard of so many policies in local Government, should be at the forefront in leading a campaign against the proposals of the Government to weaken planning law.\nThe motion is a balanced motion in that we are complimenting the Government on aspects of the announcement made on 6 September that we support, but we are making clear what we oppose.\nWe support proposals concerning the funding of new affordable housing, the refurbishment of empty homes, support for the FirstBuy shared equity scheme and support for housing associations.\nBut we are critical of the extension of permitted development rights, and the envisaged interference of the Planning Inspectorate in local decisions on planning applications, affordable housing and section 106 contributions.\nWhat we are saying tonight is entirely consistent with our actions and our words on planning issues.\nIt is consistent with our words in that we had an excellent debate on planning policy at the Council meeting on 17 October last year. I remember speaking in that debate and noting what we have achieved in Sutton in adopting and refining a planning policy that has secured the green, pleasant, suburban character of Sutton that we all treasure. But we noted in that debate threats and concerns that arose from national policy. We welcomed many aspects of the National Planning Policy Framework but saw four difficulties with the planning system that should be addressed – and for each of these I could cite specific examples in Sutton South Ward:\n1. that what is permitted development is already quite permissive and is leading to people building large and intrusive structures that should be brought within planning controls\n2. that the planning system is slow moving in dealing with developers who are recalcitrant and play the system\n3. the decisions of the Planning Inspectorate are sometimes inconsistent and unhelpful\n4. the Courts do not always seem to take breaches of planning law seriously.\nThese problems remain but, sadly, the Government has not taken our advice set out in the motion we passed. Indeed, it has moved in an opposite direction in what is now proposed.\nWhat is proposed seems to abandon the National Planning Policy Framework, does not address any of the problems that concerned us, and loosens further permitted development law.\nI do not believe for one second that the relaxation of requirements to seek planning permission for extensions to domestic properties is going to unleash an avalanche of building work, thus creating jobs. To the extent that this happens, it follows that this will be through the erection of buildings that would not be permitted under current arrangements. So this is a recipe for neighbourhood disputes and the erection of ugly buildings that society does not want, and that we certainly do not want in Sutton.\nI also particularly object to the way the package deals with affordable housing and section 106 contributions. Like most of you, I find that quite a lot of my casework as a Councillor involves families that are living in poor circumstances, often because they cannot find and afford accommodation that fits their needs. We desperately need more affordable housing. There are already “get out” clauses for developers who present financial analyses seemingly proving their development is unviable if they have to provide affordable housing. I am deeply suspicious of those processes and now there are to be further “get out” routes involving the Planning Inspectorate.\nWhat we say in this motion is also consistent with our actions. We have adopted stringent controls on development to ensure it meets the local needs of Sutton, particularly on the development of major sites and on back garden development. We do not want these interfered with by remote bodies in Whitehall and Bristol.\nWe have worked hard to control development in Sutton in a way that meets what local people want. And so much flows from the way the character of the area is preserved by our planning policies, making it an attractive environment for businesses and families. I never tire of telling people of the virtues of Sutton – low crime, good schools, attractive leafy streets, good transport connections, voted the best place in London to bring up children, a local economy that is surviving the recession well. All these things, to my mind, hinge crucially on having an attractive local environment and street scene.\nI hope these proposals will be re-thought.\nI strongly believe, in the words of the motion, that it is local people, through democratically elected local authorities, who are the best judges of what development is acceptable in an area.\nI commend this motion to Council.”",
  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_2020_07_03_exciting-new-street-art-at-sutton-station/content_56.html": "The renowned artist Lionel Stanhope has brightened up our Ward. The painting, on the railway bridge at Sutton station, is not easy to photograph, so what is shown below is a CGI of the artwork created before the painting was undertaken. What is above, is the painting.\n| The railway bridge at Sutton station has been brightened up with a painting by the renowned artist Lionel Stanhope, whose art has brightened up many railway stations. Stanhope completed the painting in four days starting on 26 May. Stanhope is regarded by many as a better and more important street artist than Banksy. We have been pleased to support this project which brings an attractive feature to add interest to the area.The façade of the railway bridge, as you come out of Sutton station and turn left,was a patchwork of various colours. The Council first tried to interest Network Rail in making the bridge look more attractive, over four years ago, during the “Sutton Gateway” project, which involved re-paving the area around the station and the installation of the clock opposite Sutton station. The artwork has been mainly funded by Network Rail, with a small contribution from Sutton Council. The parapet of the bridge required extensive cleaning and preparation before the painting commenced. Lionel Stanhope produced a design which incorporates the word “Sutton” in the typeface traditionally used by Southern railway, and a depiction of the historic Sutton locomotive. The locomotive “Sutton” came into the possession of the Council many years ago and is a 144 year old, 28 tonne, 26 feet, A1 class Terrier steam engine. It is currently with a heritage railway undertaking in Tunbridge Wells who have undertaken to restore it. The painting is an addition to an area becoming famous for its street art. Within two hundred yards you can find the remarkable statue “The Messenger”, located directly outside the entrance to Quadrant House in The Quadrant. The Messenger is a statue, a sculpture in bronze with very dark patination, completed by David Wynne in 1981, of a large horse and rider. It was a major commission for the sculptor, who died in 2014. It took four years to complete from his first idea and inspiration, on receipt of the brief – through roughing out, refining and casting in a foundry, to the final unveiling and installation. We are not including a photograph of the statue in this post due to the philistine attitude of the owners of Quadrant House, who do not cherish this artwork and have stuck a notice on the front of it about some aspect of building maintenance, thus disfiguring it. They have been unco-operative in the face of requests to remove the notice. Even more striking is the remarkable mural by the famous Spanish “street” artist from Bilbao, Eva Mena, on a wall in nearby Wellesley Road. This is said to be of the American singer and musician Erykah Badu. The work was commissioned by the owners of the building, Indepth Hygiene Services. It was painted in three days in 2010, when the artist came over from Spain to paint it. It is entirely typical of her street art, which is to be found on walls in many parts of the world, including Egypt, Ireland and Spain, as well as Sutton. Eva Mena is said to be more famous than Banky in her native Spain. |",
  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_2013_10_21_fewer-empty-homes-in-sutton/content_428.html": "With continuing pressure on housing in the Borough, it is a matter of concern if houses are left empty for long period.\nLast year Sutton Council introduced a number of technical changes to Council tax collection arrangements that changed financial incentives to keep properties empty. Richard, in his role as vice-chair of the Housing, Economy and Business Commmittee, was closely involved in the design of these changes, which involved the removal of discounts on Council tax previously enjoyed by owners of second homes and owners of empty properties.\nAt the meeting of the Housing, Economy and Business Committee on 8 October Richard commented on figures the Committee discussed that showed a fall in the number of empty properties. However, while the figures are moving in the right direction there is clearly some way to go. They show that there are still 200 properties in Sutton empty for over two years (excluding those in probate), down from 210, and over 450 properties unoccupied and unfurnished (470 down from 573).\nRichard said “at a time of housing pressure these empty properties are a cause for concern. The policy the Council introduced last year to remove financial incentives to keep properties empty has been a success, in that the numbers have fallen, but there is still a way to go.”",
  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_page_20/content_664.html": "At last some positive news on what is happening to Sutherland House, the empty building just south of the railway station in Brighton Road on the corner with Cedar Road.\nThis building has been empty far too long but we now have confirmation from the owners, Criterion Capital, that the work is well under way to renovate the building. The renovation will convert the building to 128 luxury flats with car parking spaces, one per flat.\nThey expect the work to be finished by March 2016. They will be appointing local estate agents to act for them to offer the flats for rent. We are a little surprised that they are to be offered for rent rather than sale, but given the location close to the station there will be no shortage of demand. We doubt if they will be actively marketing the flats until the work is sufficiently progressed for them to have a show flat for people to look at, but they say the work will be to a high standard.\nWe have been critical of the developers as they used a route to bypass normal planning permission requirements, but at last work is under way and we have a date by which the building will be occupied. The year 2016 will be a good one for the area with the occupation of the Subsea7 building and Sutherland House, bringing people into the area who will spend money in local shops and restaurants, which will give the whole area an uplift.\nThe argument over the future of Sutherland House was the subject of a letter from Richard published by The Guardian (the national paper, not the Sutton Guardian) on 5 February. Here is the text:\n“Sir\nCongratulations to The Guardian for exposing the loss of affordable housing that has resulted from the Government’s successive changes to planning law.\nThe latest changes are in a series that have progressively created major loopholes to excuse developers from providing affordable housing. Just south of Sutton station, in south London, there is an office building, empty for some years, which the developers propose to convert to 128 luxury flats. The day before Sutton Council’s Planning Committee was to approve the scheme, which included a significant number of affordable homes, the developers withdrew the scheme. They had spotted the advantages to them if they followed a newly-created route called “prior approval” that has now forced the Council to accept the application with zero affordable homes included.\nOn one calculation, our Borough may have lost up to 500 affordable homes due to that legislation. The latest changes you highlight are further steps on a path that is seriously undermining the efforts of local authorities to help those in dire need of better housing.\nCouncillor Richard Clifton, Chair of Planning Committee, London Borough of Sutton”\nAt the meeting of Sutton Council on 19 January Richard criticised the owners of Sutherland House for their “inertia” in relation to the re-development of the empty building.\nRichard joined with Sutton Councillor Hanna Zuchowska in pointing out that the owners withdrew an application for planning permission that included an element of affordable housing before exploiting recent changes in planning law to get permission for conversion of the building to 128 luxury flats with no affordable housing element. But still, although the building has been empty for five years, they do not get on with the re-development.\nSpeaking after the meeting Richard said “The building is still empty and a blot on the landscape. The development of the Subsea7 building, bringing 800 office jobs to the area, and the improvements associated with the Sutton Gateway project, are giving a lift to the area just south of Sutton station. We need the developers to get on with the renovation of Sutherland House.”\nThe full text of Richard’s speech, seconding a motion on affordable housing, is as follows:\n“In seconding this motion, I would like to draw attention to the opening sentence, which speaks of the widening gap between the rich and the poor.\nI find it astonishing that in my own lifetime the wealth gap between rich and poor has not just failed to diminish but has actually widened.\nThe figures are so astounding one hardly believes them – that the top 80 (eight zero) wealthiest individuals in the world own more than half the world’s wealth, that is they own as much as half the population of the planet.\nAnd in our own country about 30 billionaires own half the wealth of the nation.\nAnd the implications of this inequality are not just a matter of concern for social policy.\nA fascinating study published by the OECD last December showed that countries with a smaller and narrowing gap between rich and poor experienced higher rates of economic growth, and if the gap between rich and poor had not widened in Britain from the 1980’s the UK economy would in fact be 20% larger.\nGeorge Osborne ought to reflect on the reasons for this. If you increase the earnings of the poor they will spend it, creating income, jobs and wealth for others, but if you increase the earnings of the rich they may save much of it. He ought to remember this when he plans yet further raids on the welfare budget, on financial support to the very poorest in society, rather than asking the wealthy to contribute more.\nIt is a finding that demonstrates that the so-called “trickledown” economics so beloved of leaders on the right of the political spectrum – and that included Margaret Thatcher – whereby largesse afforded to the very rich trickled down to help the very poor, was in fact a recipe for lower growth and thus a lower increase in living standards for all.\nWe need concerted policy action to deal with this, and tax rates on the highest earners, property taxes, the minimum wage, and welfare support to the very poor, are all important aspects. But we all know that action and support for those in need can be best targeted if undertaken at a local level.\nHere in Sutton, we will continue to do what we can to build a fairer and more equal society, something of particular importance to us as Liberal Democrats, even if what we can do is sometimes at the most basic level, such as dealing with concerns about food and housing.\nAnd the fact that we have Food Banks, here in Britain, in one of the more affluent countries in the world, makes my point about inequality more eloquently than any of my words can do.\nOn housing, we can be proud of our record in Sutton.\nAs Councillor McCoy told us, the Council is promoting affordable housing, something that is vital when I find that in my own Ward changes to planning law mean that a block like Sutherland House can become 128 luxury flats with no affordable housing requirement atall. If and when the developers finally get on with it, and I deplore their inertia.\nAnd the Council is dealing with homelessness: I was heartened by the serious and concerned tone of the debate at Planning Committee on the proposal to provide short-term accommodation for homeless families in Benhill Road. It was the Committee at its best. This was on an evening – 17 December 2014 – when no less than 76 (seven six) Sutton families were homeless and in bed and breakfast accommodation, often miles from Sutton.\nMr. Mayor, we must continue our efforts as a Council to care for the most needy of our residents, while having a concern – as citizens – to promote policies, at every level, that will increase economic growth but distribute the rewards more fairly.\nI am pleased to second the motion.”",
  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_2021_03_17_speed-limits-and-controls-on-parking/content_173.html": "Dealing with parking problems and speeding vehicles has always been a problem. The Council has now concluded, for our Ward, the long-running consultation on parking and has introduced new measures on speeding. While the Council has, on legal advice, amended or withdrawn the six month trial low traffic neighbourhood schemes funded by Transport for London, we have studied resident reaction to these trial schemes and retained the aspects that were popular.\nWe have retained the 20 miles per hour speed limit area in the east of the Ward that was originally introduced as part of these schemes. Consultation with residents showed this was popular and we are discussing action to achieve more enforcement of the limits. The speed limit area covers Mayfield Road and the roads in the Ward to the east of it. This is the area where, following lengthy consultation, a new parking control area was introduced last November. This has cleared parking from these roads which has encouraged speeding, thus justifying the new controls on speeding. The Council’s consultation exercise on parking reached a successful conclusion last year with the Sutton South Permit Parking Area now introduced. An earlier proposal was thrown out by residents but this proposal achieved majority support, generally by overwhelming majorities, in the roads consulted. We regard this as evidence of the success of the approach of the Council, with successive rounds of careful consultation. The parking permit area will be subject to a review this summer. Do contact us if there are aspects of the scheme you want reviewed.",
  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_author_richardclifton_page_14/content_822.html": "Sutton is renowned for low crime and good schools. Like all London boroughs we have had to deal with the bulge in pupil numbers. This has gone through the primary school system and our excellent local primary schools in this area have been able to cope, with most parents still getting their first choice of school. Many secondary schools in Sutton have expanded, including our popular local school Overton Grange, but two new secondary schools will still be needed and are planned. The new Harris Academy, integrated into the Sutton Cancer Hub development, is already proving popular with parents who plan to apply for places next year. Parents can be reassured that Sutton will be able to cope with the increased numbers without a fall in the high quality of local education or unacceptable congestion problems at the schools, which the schools have plans in place to cope with.\nYET AGAIN\nNEW LICENCE APPLICATION IN SUTTON SOUTH WARD\nThe Licensing Committee has received an application to open new premises at 11 Regent Parade, Brighton Road. This is for a salon, with the name Bamboo, providing reflexology and massage by certified Chinese practitioners. Regent Parade is the parade of shops just south of Sutton station, on the western side of Brighton Road, just north of the petrol station.\nThis is known as a “Special Treatments Licence.” Under the London Authorities Act 1991 premises offering special treatments involving a degree of physical contact (such as massage, acupuncture, manicure, piercing and tattooing) must have a “Special Treatments Licence” to undertake such activities.\nThere is a 28 days consultation period during which representations can be submitted to the Council’s Licensing Section. The full details of the application can be found on this link\nhttps://www.sutton.gov.uk/info/200549/licensing/1325/current_applications\nwww.sutton.gov.uk/info/200549/licensing/1325/current_applications\nIf you wish to submit a representation it must be received by 11th November 2017. The link also provides details on how to make a representation. Do let us know if you make a representation.\nDOCTORS’ SURGERIES\nMany local residents use the medical centre in Grove Road in Sutton. Several years ago Richard was involved, with former Councillor Heather Honour, in a campaign to prevent this practice closing and moving to the Henderson hospital site in Belmont, as there were few transport links to the site and it would not have been easily accessible to those without a car.\nWe are pleased that this proposal is not being proceeded with. NHS Sutton Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) now propose to move the surgery to a health centre in Robin Hood Lane in central Sutton, closer to the current practice. This is a proposal currently being worked up. It is also proposed to move the Mulgrave Road surgery, which many local residents use, to this site. The full list of surgeries that might move to the site is:\n- Grove Road practice\n- Mulgrave road surgery\n- Benhill surgery (part of Benhill and Belmont GP centre)\nIn addition, Dr Grice and partners branch surgery is already at the site (though not their main surgery at the Old Court House) and Dr Seyan and partners are already at the site. If you are registered with any of these practices you should have received a letter from the CCG inviting views on the proposal.\nThe Grove Road practice does need to move. It is currently in a converted house so some surgery rooms are upstairs, with no lift, and it is not possible to have a private conversation with reception staff as the reception is in the hallway of the house. It does not meet modern standards and NHS England will require it to move. But there are few sites available in Sutton. There are some similar problems with the Mulgrave Road surgery.\nYou can comment on this proposal, which is at an early stage of development, at\nFor our part, we will be seeking to ensure that transport and accessibility issues are fully taken into consideration when working up the proposal.\nA GREEN AND PLEASANT SUTTON SOUTH\nOne of our concerns as Councillors is to maintain the pleasant, green, suburban feel of our area. Recently there have been a number of planning applications for sites in our Ward, including in Cavendish Road, Langley Park Road and Downside Road, that the Council’s planning officers have, rightly, turned down.\nThese have included proposals for house extensions that would close the visual gap between houses, causing harm to the spacious and open character of most of the roads in our Ward, and proposals for blocks of flats whose height, bulk, mass and design would constitute an unsympathetic form of development and have a detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the area. Applications have also been turned down where at least some affordable housing ought to be provided, to promote mixed and balanced communities.\nWe are concerned that developments should relate sympathetically to the street scene and the local area. We have also objected to the way the Planning Inspectorate in Bristol sometimes over-rules democratic local decisions, leading to inappropriate development.\nA post below describes the concerns in Cavendish Road. In Langley Park Road a proposal for a block of flats was turned down because the proposed development would result in an incongruous layout and unduly prominent development, excessive in scale, bulk and width, with an overly dominant parking area to the front out of keeping with the existing development pattern in the locality, thus detrimental to the character and appearance of the area and the street scene. It would by virtue of its siting and height result in an unacceptable impact on the outlook of the neighbouring occupiers, and would be detrimental to the health of significant trees affected by the development.\nIn Downside Road a proposal for erection of a two storey side/rear extension was turned down by the Council. The grounds were:\n- The proposal would uncharacteristically close the visual gap between the application site and the adjoining neighbour causing significant and unacceptable harm to the spacious and open character of Downside Road and resulting in a visual terracing impact on the street scene contrary to planning policies.\n- The proposal, by reason of its lack of a setback from the shared side boundary and excessively narrow garage, would result in a contrived appearance that would fail to relate sympathetically and subordinately to the original dwelling and cause harm to the street scene and the local area contrary to planning policies.\nSLOWING TRAFFIC IN FARM ROAD AND GRANGE VALE\nAt the South Sutton, Cheam and Belmont Local Committee meeting on 7 September our main decision was to install a vehicle operated sign in Farm Road to reduce speeding. Richard lives round the corner from Farm Road and vehicles certainly speed down it. This complements other measures in the Ward to reduce speeding, in particular in Cavendish Road and Cedar Road.\nWe also agreed to install a width restriction at the point in Grange Vale where the road passes under the bridge. The speed of vehicles has a safety implication for pedestrians walking west to east on the narrow pathway, particularly if pushing a buggy. We also agreed to plant a replacement for the vandalised tree in Willis Avenue. The committee also agreed Richard’s proposal to purchase from the Royal British Legion a “Silent Soldier” and install it in the flower beds in front of Northumberland House. These are large silhouettes of soldiers, designed to be installed through 2018 in prominent places to remind us that this is the centenary of the conclusion of the Great War.\nWe hope the parking consultation will now take place much earlier than anticipated.\nPROTECTING OUR ENVIRONMENT\nThe concern of Sutton Council to protect the green and pleasant environment in our Ward has again been demonstrated in Cavendish Road, though the threat to sensible and informed local decision taking from the remote Planning Inspectorate, based in Bristol, remains.\nA planning application was submitted for the buildings at 7-9 Cavendish Road, previously a care home, for demolition of the buildings and erection of a three storey block of flats, with roof accommodation, comprising 16 flats (three 1-bedroomed, seven 2-bedroomed and six 3-bedroomed), 9 car parking spaces, secure cycle parking, provision of a refuse store, with access to the rear.\nThe Council has turned the application down. The Council considered that the proposed development, by reason of its height, bulk, mass and detailed design, would constitute an unsympathetic form of development that would have a negative visual impact on the Cavendish Road street scene. The proposed development would therefore have a detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the area.\nThe Council also turned the application down because it considered that at least some affordable housing ought to be provided as part of an acceptable development on this site and, as such, the proposal would cause significant harm to the promotion of mixed and balanced communities.\nAn earlier application was also turned down but is now the subject of an appeal to the Planning Inspectorate. This is a threat we cannot control. We will let residents know the outcome and if further applications are made.\nA proposal for a house extension in Downside Road was also rejected as it would close the visual gap between houses, causing harm to the spacious and open character of the road and result in a visual terracing impact on the street scene.\nREDUCING VEHICLE CO2 EMISSIONS IN SUTTON SOUTH\nA significant part of the northernmost section of Sutton South Ward is in the central Sutton Controlled Parking Zone. Sutton Council is consulting on a scheme to alter charges for parking permits in the Controlled Parking Zone so that charges relate to the CO2 emissions of vehicles. It is also introducing special provisions to help carers and those undertaking childcare who are regular visitors.\nThe general nature of the Order is, to support the Council’s Parking Strategy and policy to cut carbon emissions in the Borough, to link the charges for parking permits in the controlled parking zones to the CO2 emissions of the vehicle for which the permit is issued; and also to introduce the facility to purchase carer and childcare permits for use in the zones. The impact will be to reduce charges for the least polluting vehicles and increase them for some others, and facilitate carers and those with regular childcare responsibilities to park in the zone.\nYou can find the proposals at\nwww.sutton.gov.uk/trafficpublicnotices\nclicking on “view our Permanent Traffic Order Consultations” and “Notices of Proposals”\nReference PP1035 – CPZ permit charge changes linked to CO2 emissions and carer permits\nComments are invited by 31 August.\nRichard has commented on the proposals that he would like to see a differential scheme imposed for diesel vehicles as they do not emit excessive CO2 compared to other vehicles but do emit other harmful particulates.\nCONSULTATION ON CHANGES TO TRAIN SERVICES FROM SUTTON\nTo find the consultation, and make comments, you need to click on this link, then go to “Be Part of It” and click on “Read More”, then click on information sheet 4 to discover what is proposed for our area.\n[NOTE: The information above was correct when this post was posted. As of 30 July, they seem to have removed information sheet 4 and are promising it will be restored, with an invitation to comment, in the autumn. We are trying to find out what is happening. It is still worthwhile visiting the site. ]\nCHANGES TO OUR POLICE TEAM\nAt the Sutton South Ward consultative meeting with the local police on 11 June we learned that our long serving PC, Mark Towler, is moving to other duties. There is a new policing model being adopted and our Ward will be under Sergeant Anna Smith – who also covers Cheam, Belmont and Sutton West – but with two dedicated Ward officers – Kelly Heath and Andy Peak – plus a PCSO (Laura Jagoe, who has been with us a long time but is currently on maternity leave).\nWe recorded our grateful thanks to Mark, who will be missed.\nThe meeting heard that Sutton South remains a low crime area with just two house burglaries, though four garage burglaries, in the previous twelve weeks. The sector priorities remain tackling burglary, anti-social behaviour and speeding, while for our area we asked the police to continue to keep an eye on drug use at certain addresses, speeding and action to deal with all-day drinking.",

I hope that this will be answered in the communications that we are having with the Transaction Board, but this is not satisfactory.",

We are delighted this scheme, which has been so successful, has been repeated despite the massive pressure on Sutton Council due to Government cuts in funding.",
  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_category_local-issues_page_5/content_282.html": "The extended yellow lines at the bottom of Downside Road\nThere is further progress on the traffic and parking schemes under consideration for the Ward to report following the meeting of the South Sutton, Cheam and Belmont Local Committee held on 8 September 2016 and the discussion at the Environment and Neighbourhoods Committee on 15 September of a global strategy for parking. To ensure a consistent approach throughout the Borough, all local schemes will be drawn into a central strategy and progressed on the basis of an assessment of priorities.\nAn ambitious scheme for the introduction of a 20mph scheme across most of the area of Sutton South Ward west of the Sutton to Belmont railway line has now been included in the “Local Implementation Plan” prepared by Transport for London. This was the subject of proposals put to the local committee in 2015. However, it is on the “reserve list” which means that implementation in the near future is most unlikely.\nA parking scheme for the newly-named Berridge Close is agreed, implementation to coincide with the opening of the adjacent Subsea7 building, as this will lead to more intensive use of the road by those working in the building and accessing the underground car park. Obstructive parking in Berridge Close could lead to problems when the building is occupied, so needs to be avoided. It is proposed that the road will be included in the controlled parking zone with four parking bays in the road, reserved for residents with parking permits. Completion of the building is unlikely before December.\nTraffic and parking schemes were the subject of a session at the December 2015 meeting of the South Sutton, Cheam and Belmont Local Committee, when residents noted down parking and traffic problems. A list of the proposals raised by residents was reported back to the local committee meeting on 10 March.\nIn relation to our own area, the proposals fell into three main categories.\nFirst, concerns about intensive and sometimes obstructive parking in Mayfield Road and roads nearby (The Ridgway, Chalgrove Road, Upland Road).\nSecond, concerns about visibility at the Farm Road / The Ridgway junction.\nThird, a set of other concerns, mostly about speeding at various locations.\nThis listing will form the agenda for further work by the traffic department within a wider cross-Borough study, which is centrally managed by the Council. A number of minor, initial proposals were agreed on 10 March, including to restrict parking at the Prior Avenue / Banstead Road junction due to visibility issues.\nThe question of a parking control scheme in Mayfield Road and the surrounding area was the subject of a consultation exercise by local Councillors last year which showed support in Mayfield Road but not adjacent roads. On 10 March the local committee agreed to devote some of its public realm funds to fund the traffic department to “kick start” a study of potential for parking controls in this area. A discussion between traffic engineers and Ward Councillors to consider this study was held on 8 June in Mayfield Road. The traffic engineers will design a parking control scheme for consultation. The precise parameters of this scheme and the consultation have yet to be finalised. Consultation with residents is due to begin in January 2017.\nSome residents of Audley Place have commented to us that there is difficulty when driving out of Audley Place in seeing vehicles coming down Camborne Road, if cars are parked close to the corner. We raised this issue with traffic engineers and the Council is proposing a small extension of the yellow lines on each side at the exit from Audley Place. We think this will do the trick in terms of making it easier, and safer, to drive out into Camborne Road.\nResidents of Tapestry Close have complained to us about obstructive parking in the Close. We raised this issue with traffic engineers and a scheme of yellow lining was proposed. Further consultation with residents, required by law, found some residents objecting and this scheme is currently on hold.\nSeveral schemes consulted on some time ago have now been implemented, including yellow lining at the bottom of Downside Road to deal with obstructive parking (see photo above) and switching some “pay and display” bays to “dual use” so residents with parking permits can use them, in Grange Road and Langley Park Road.",

Last year, we were delighted by the re-surfacing of the pavement in Mayfield Road.

Richard is to chair the new Audit and Governance Committee while Trish is a member of the important Housing, Economy and Business Committee. Steve Cook, who was Deputy Mayor when Richard was Mayor in 2016, was elected Mayor. Richard moved the nomination. This is his speech.\n“Madame Mayor, I wanted to begin my remarks by echoing what many others have said about the grace, dignity, hard work and commitment you have brought, with Councillor Heron, to the Mayoralty this year.\nSo let me turn now to another Councillor who, I know, will bring commitment and hard work to the Mayoralty in this coming year, if Council accepts my nomination tonight.\nIt gives me great pleasure to nominate, to be Mayor of the London Borough of Sutton for the year 2018-19, Councillor Steve Cook.\nI cannot resist beginning by saying that if you do accept this nomination it will be the second time in three years that the Mayor of Sutton has been a Muswell Hillbilly, as Steve and I discovered we share a common birthplace, a maternity hospital (sadly later demolished) in Alexandra Park Road in Muswell Hill, in north London. And for those too young to recognise the reference, “I’m a Muswell Hillbilly” is a song made famous by The Kinks pop group, who hail from Muswell Hill, and famous Muswell Hillbillies include Steve and myself, obviously, Ray and Dave Davies of The Kinks, Adam Ant and Alvin Stardust – so a really distinguished company of people.\nLet me tell you about Steve. Steve was born on the Queen’s coronation day, so every birthday is the anniversary of the Coronation, of Sir Edmund Hillary climbing Everest and of the D-Day landings.\nHe left school as a teenager after the tragic death of his father and after he had himself suffered a major, life threatening illness. He became a runner in the Soho film business and was such a great success that by the 1980s he had his own large scale, thriving post production studios, in Soho, in London, and in Los Angeles.\nBut Steve is a drummer, and in a particular milieu, Steve is famous, famous for the Steve Cook Soul Band, formed in 1975. The Steve Cook Soul Band was effectively the “house” band at the Grosvenor House Hotel in Park Lane for over twenty years, the industry favourite for charity balls and awards ceremonies, performing at numerous awards and film industry functions.\nI am told that at its height it had 17 members including musicians and go-go dancers.\nThere are many stories about the band. There is a story that in the 1980s they played at the Istanbul Advertising Awards ceremony, followed by a live televised gig at the Istanbul Hilton, and an international incident was narrowly avoided when the skimpily clad go-go dancers were featured on the front page of the Turkish equivalent of the News of the World.\nThe band lasted from 1975 until its last gig in 2010 – 35 glorious years.\nSteve became a Councillor in 2015 after being Chair of the local residents’ association which successfully campaigned against a huge McDonalds drive-through in Wallington.\nNow in some London Boroughs there is a tradition that whoever is Deputy Mayor one year then becomes Mayor the following year. We have not constrained ourselves in that way in Sutton but of course Steve was, with Councillor Patel, Deputy Mayor just over a year ago, so he has the experience to avoid the traps and be a great Mayor. And his wife Pauline, who had a distinguished career in education in Sutton – headteacher at Robin Hood infants school for twenty years and at Thomas Wall Nursery school for eight year – brought great dedication to the role of Deputy Mayoress, and will be an excellent Mayoress.\nMadame Mayor, I nominate Councillor Steve Cook.”",

Sutton Central Ward is immediately north of our Ward, Sutton South.\nRichard got more votes than all the other six candidates added together. The result was\nLiberal Democrats 1291\nConservatives 327\nReform 282\nLabour 216\nThree other candidates (the Greens, an independent and the Christian People’s Alliance) each got less than 100 votes.\nThe Liberal Democrat share of the vote increased by 17.4%, the Conservatives fell by 10% and Labour – who finished second in this seat in 2022 – by 17.4%.\nOn 3 March the Council discussed the budget proposals for the coming year. Legally, the Council is required to set a balanced budget. With so many Councils going bust or in great financial difficulty, this was always going to be a difficult task. The problems are due to a legacy of Government cuts but also a big spike in demand for services. While people think of the Council as the body that mends the potholes, empties the bins and fixes the street lights, 70% of spending is on adult social care and children’s services (particularly for those children with special educational needs), plus the cost of finding accommodation for the homeless. There has been an increase in demand in the past year, particularly in the number of adults whose social care has to be paid for by the Council, the number of children with special educational needs and in the number of homeless families.\nRichard spoke in the debate, on homelessness – a subject in which he has a special interest due to the work history of his daughter, Ellie, who worked for many years for a homelessness charity and because as chair of Planning Committee he has a role in increasing the supply of affordable family accommodation.\nHere is Richard’s speech:\n“I would like to direct the attention of Council to paragraph 8.11 of the supplemental agenda which is discussing financial risks.\nIt says that the biggest driver of overspending by London boroughs is the number of people presenting as homeless and who need to be offered temporary accommodation.\nThe paper tells us Sutton had 1 084 households homeless and in temporary accommodation in October last year. It is a higher figure tonight. It is a frightening figure. Tonight we are discussing homelessness as a financial risk to the Council, but we all recognise that the fundamental reason for our concern is that behind so many of these cases are stories of tragedy, of families losing their homes and often winding up in bed and breakfast accommodation remote from their workplace and remote from the schools their children attend.\nThere is a housing crisis and we need more homes. Residents comment on the number of new flats being built in the centre of Sutton but we need this accommodation.\nThe aspiration of the Government to build more homes is right – but it has to be tempered by a concern about quality and about dealing with the consequences.\nSutton is very built up. It is not always easy to see where the new homes will come from, particularly when we are all rightly sensitive to the concerns of residents about inappropriate development and the pressures intensification can bring.\nIt is worthwhile re-stating the principles in our local plan for Sutton.\nWe need more housing, but it must be of good quality – good enough for Sutton, which means of high quality.\nWe aim to reduce development pressures on what I call the “suburban heartland” of the borough by concentrating development in the areas where development is appropriate.\nIn particular there is a zone of potential intensification close to the town centre where public transport connections are good. This may mean some tall buildings. It may mean car free or car light development as you can provide much more accommodation if you do not have to provide a parking space for every unit, and this is more acceptable in areas close to the railway station and the town centre where public transport connections are good.\nWe have a local plan, currently under review, which sets out how we meet the requirements for infrastructure to support an increase in population, which is an important concern of residents.\nI am always keen to point out that our local plan is not like the local plan you might find in, for example, North Korea, mandating what will be built. It is aspirational. It depends on developers bringing forward proposals. Its success depends a lot on the skills of our planning staff in negotiating with developers to secure what is good for Sutton, which may not be what makes most profit for the developer. I would like to pay tribute to the work of our planning staff and in particular the head, Andy Webber, who retires this month.\nIn the past year the planning system has had a bad press. The Government says we are going for growth, growth, growth. Quite right. But when asked what are the impediments to growth they invariably cite the planning system – which is represented as run by NIMBYS frustrating necessary development. That might well be the case in some places – not here in Sutton of course. But I think there is a counter argument that the planning system is a bastion against having fields and fields of sub-standard housing, as that is what makes money for developers. We destroy the planning system at our peril. But it is also right that we need a planning system that does not stand in the way of necessary change and renewal, but ensures high quality and appropriate development, to provide housing and to stimulate the economy.\nI think we have a good track record in Sutton in supporting high quality development and there are many examples in our borough of developments characterised by good design providing quality housing and infrastructure. That is what we need.”\nThere are a number of locations in our Ward where there are benches to enable weary pedestrians to put up their feet. At the most recent meeting of the Council’s local committee we got agreement to re-new two benches in the Ward that have deteriorated over time. These are benches in Copse Hill and the one in the photograph, which is at the junction of The Ridgway and Mayfield Road.\nThere is a history to some of the benches in our Ward. In 1988 the South Sutton Neighbourhood Association celebrated the tenth anniversary of its foundation by funding a bench in Cavendish Road close to Ambleside Gardens. The bench was, after over twenty years of use and exposure to the elements, in a very sorry state. We took action to get the bench restored, with the plaque explaining the history of the bench moved to the new bench.\nOn the 27th of January Sutton Council met. Richard raised the issue of the reasons why a recent survey by The Times newspaper ranked Sutton as the eighth most attractive place to live in England. This finding does not surprise us. We spend a lot of time knocking on the doors of our residents to introduce ourselves as your local Councillors and we find people generally say they really like Sutton, mentioning a strong sense of community, open spaces, low crime, good schools, a green and pleasant environment, parks, street trees, being convenient for London and for the countryside. This is particularly the case with people who have moved to Sutton from elsewhere, particularly those from other London boroughs, from Hong Kong and from Ukraine. Please write to us and tell us what you like about Sutton or think we can improve.\nWe are always keen to look at ways of improving our Ward.\nLast year traffic engineers undertook a study of traffic flows in our Ward and the results of the exercise are listed in a later post on this site. The results have not led to some “standout” conclusion as to a problem that needs tackling but traffic officers are examining three main issues:\nwhether action can be taken to improve the safety and the experience of pedestrians crossing the Kings Lane bridge without closing the road to vehicles. The bridge is narrow. Installing a second bridge would be impossibly expensive. Marking a pedestrian path at one side of the road might be feasible. We would welcome the views of users of the bridge, both pedestrians and motorists\nsimilarly, whether something can be done to improve the safety and the experience of pedestrians passing under the railway bridge in Langley Park Road. Some proposals are to be consulted on\npossible improvements to the busy junction where Cedar Road crosses Langley Park Road. Residents have spoken to us of the difficulties pedestrians have in crossing Langley Park Road. Consultation with residents in adjacent streets is underway on proposals to install two new traffic islands in Langley Park Road. These will form a safe area in the middle of the road so the road can be crossed by pedestrians in two phases.\nYour views on these issues, and views on any other traffic and parking issues you would like us to look at would be welcomed.\nThe way to get in touch with us on any issue, or to volunteer, is by email\nrichard.clifton@sutton.gov.uk\ntrish.fivey@sutton.gov.uk\nlouise.phelan@sutton.gov.uk\nor by phone on 0775 905 0685\nSTOP PRESS: A date for the next Sutton South Ward Community/Police Consultative meeting has provisionally been set, subject to the police consulting their rotas, Wednesday 14 May 2025, 7 pm, at Devonshire Avenue school.

Sutton has a lower crime rate than most outer London boroughs and our Ward has one of the lowest crime rates in Sutton. However, crime always has a significant impact on the victim and public concern remains high. The draft minutes of the meeting are as below.\nSUTTON SOUTH COMMUNITY / POLICE MEETING. 15 JANUARY 2025 Attended by PC Robyn Skivens and PCSO Helen Maguire for the police. A report was given on main crime trends from 1 September to the date of the meeting. DRUG OFFENCES There had been 18 drug offences, mainly possession of drugs, mainly cannabis. While this was higher than normal the increase was partly attributable to a special police operation at Sutton train station. Four of these crimes were the interception by the Border Force of drug shipments. Where such a shipment is to premises in our Ward it will count in our statistics. BURGLARY There had been 21 burglaries or attempted burglaries. This included residential burglaries, burglaries of garages and sheds, and some burglaries of businesses. It was noted that there was usually a seasonal increase in burglary at this time of year as it was darker earlier. There had been eight residential burglaries. However, some that had been reported in sheltered accommodation in the Ward were later disproved and attributed to dementia. A disturbing case was that of a landlord who was able to let himself into a flat and commit theft. Two burglaries of garages had involved theft of bicycles. Mention was made of a shop in Brighton Road where the window was smashed and the wooden panel that was then put in place to secure the premises was pulled away to facilitate burglary. Mention was made of the theft of tools from a construction site in the Ward. Some burglaries had involved the theft of keys, which were then used to commit further offences (theft of a car key leading to theft of a car). The police stressed the need to make sure keys were kept out of sight – if the keys can be seen from your letterbox you are inviting crime.\nVEHICLE CRIME\nThere had been 14 instances of vehicle crime (theft of vehicles, damage to vehicles, theft from vehicles). The police stressed the need to avoid leaving anything of value on display in your car, or in the car at all. An unusual crime had been the theft of an excavator and a dumper from the road works in Brighton Road. THEFT There had been 23 crimes in a category the police described as “theft and kindred (to theft)” events. This included shoplifting, parcel theft, theft of pedal cycles and mobile phones. Examples mentioned included theft of scrap metal, theft of a wheelie bin and theft of a wedding ring by distraction techniques. MAJOR CRIMES There had been nine major, violent crimes in the Ward. This included several robberies at the train station, a large group altercation outside a restaurant, a fight between two drug users, and a concerning incident of a woman who was followed from the station and robbed. There were also two incidents of arson, of a bin and of a Ford transit. A ULEZ camera was deliberately damaged. There was an incident where a drug user was searched and a knife, and bladed articles, were found to be in his possession. There was a disturbing incident of an anti-semitic symbol being daubed on a wall outside the synagogue in Cedar Road. There had been a succession of incidents related to a woman living in Cedar Road who had engaged in anti- social activities that had attracted a community of drug users to her premises. This was now the subject of police reports to the DPS that were expected to lead to her being charged with serious offences. SPEEDING The police had been conducting a programme of visits to local care homes and sheltered housing to talk about scams. Residents had raised with them concerns about speeding in Cavendish Road, which had led to police action in that road. There was a discussion of speeding in local roads including Chalgrove Road, Langley Park Road, The Ridgway and Cavendish Road. The police had been carrying out speed checks in Chalgrove Road and Cavendish Road. The action in Cavendish Road had led to twelve drivers receiving warnings. The police would consider further action against speeding in local roads, subject to resources.\nOTHER MATTERS DISCUSSED Staffing levels: There should be in theory be a third officer on the Ward to support Robyn and Helen, but they were coping. The number of “extractions” when they were called away to join police exercises elsewhere in London, or at the Croydon custody suite, remained an issue of concern but was now running close to 35% of their time rather than the 50% it had once been. Mention was made of local concern about a story that a body had been discovered at a house in Egmont Road. The police assured the meeting that there was no wider implication of this incident. The next meeting was tentatively scheduled for Wednesday 14 May at Devonshire Avenue school (7pm) subject to the police checking their work rota. The meeting thanked Robyn for coming back from leave to attend the meeting and thanked the officers for their work for the community in dealing with crime in the Ward. The meeting thanked Fiona Ostler for letting us meet at the school. The date of the next meeting was provisionally set as Wednesday 14 May, at Devonshire Avenue primary school and thought continues to be given to what could be done to better publicise the meeting and get a better attendance.\nConstable Skivens, Louise, Trish and Richard with other Ward police officers at the Sutton South Hello Christmas party\nThe Phoenix Concert Band – which is based in our Ward and for which Richard plays trumpet – were busy over the Christmas period raising money for the Mayor of Sutton’s charity appeal. The band practices every Friday in the church at Christchurch in Christchurch Park. A concert in the church, staged by the band in December, drew an audience of over a hundred and raised £790 for the charity appeal. The band also played Christmas carols at an event in the Straw cafe in Manor Park in December, which raised £360. On the last Saturday before Christmas the band joined a wider group of musicians to play Christmas carols in the atrium of the St Nicholas shopping centre in Sutton (see photo) which raised £180, so £1330 in all. We were grateful to the Mayor, Councillor Colin Stears, who attended all these events. In addition the band played a concert at the Friends’ Meeting House in Cedar Road on the second Saturday in December, to entertain an enthusiastic audience before the “Second Saturday Tea” which the Quakers provide every month on the second Saturday. The Mayor of Sutton’s charities are Home-Start, Sutton, and Sutton, Kingston and Epsom – Parkinson’s UK. Our contribution to the appeal was dwarfed by the £10 000 prize for second place in the boroughs’ competition won by the Sutton float in the London New Year’s Day parade.\nWe pride ourselves on the fact that we have a network of dedicated volunteers who deliver our “FOCUS” magazine throughout the Ward. If you have the odd half hour a few times a year to support us in this way please contact us. We recently prepared an end of year newsletter to update our volunteer deliverers on our activities. We thought we would share it with those who look at our website.\n“The last year has been our most successful year in Sutton South Ward. With the election of Luke as our Member of Parliament in July we have, for the first time, three Liberal Democrat Councillors representing our Ward and a Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament representing us at Westminster. We held a successful Ward meeting on 28 November where we heard from Luke on the incredibly busy life he now has as our Member of Parliament. He has been meeting all the important community groups in Sutton and Cheam, and has made speeches in Parliament on a variety of issues – ranging from the importance of support for carers to the future of Taiwan. In his maiden speech he spoke about what a pleasant place Sutton is to live, work and raise a family, a great change from the previous MP who spent all his time running Sutton down. He is enthusiastic about his role as spokesperson for London. As Ward Councillors, we have a lot of local casework that we deal with and are doing more than our fair bit as Chairs of Council committees – Trish chairing the Audit and Governance Committee, Richard the Planning Committee and Louise combining being chair of the Licensing Committee with her role as Deputy Mayor. This is her second year as Deputy Mayor following the three years during which Trish was Mayor.\nLike every local authority, Sutton Council is pre-occupied by financial issues and struggling with some difficult decisions to balance the books. The decision to close the Registrar’s office (The Russetings) in Worcester Road was one we regretted, driven by a need to consolidate services in fewer buildings, but we believe planning controls are sufficient to protect the appearance of this attractive, locally listed, building in the street scene.\nWe have secured funding for improvements to the WArd, including new information signs at the only open space in our Ward – the Devonshire Avenue Nature Area (DANA). Maintenance of the nature area involves a balance of ensuring it is a peaceful place for people to visit while preserving the biodiversity of the site. There is now a Friends of DANA group – let us know if you would like to join it. We are already looking forward to our next electoral challenge, to retain control of the Council in 2026. We need to keep up the work of talking to our residents, delivering our literature and doorknocking. Let us know if you are interested in being one of our candidates. We welcome talking or corresponding with you and with all our residents. We hope to have further Ward meetings next year. We are really grateful for the help we get.”\nSutton South Councillors were concerned to learn about changes proposed to the organisation of the Police Cadets, who meet at a school in our ward. Currently there are over 120 cadets. However, the decision has been made to close junior cadets and cut the remaining senior cadets to just 46. Their future programme is also being severely curtailed. This will have a major impact on the youth of this borough who will no longer have the opportunity to participate in activities such as camps, parades and Duke of Edinburgh awards.\nCouncillor Louise Phelan, whose son has been a Cadet, commented “I’ve seen first-hand the benefits of being part of police cadets. They learn valuable life skills, and gain self confidence. They also support the local community and get to take part in things they wouldn’t otherwise have had the opportunity to do. For many this is a stepping stone into a career within the police force, for others the Cadets help to keep them on the right path and make better life decisions. I am incredibly concerned others will now not get these opportunities.”",
  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_category_health_page_3/content_327.html": "WEEKLY COLLECTION OF FOOD WASTE PROPOSED\nProposals for a new waste collection service include a weekly collection of food waste.\nThere will continue to be fortnightly collection of re-cycling waste. The waste that currently goes in the brown bin will be divided, with the food waste collected weekly and other waste collected fortnightly. At present around 40 per cent of brown-bin waste is food waste, so this will mean residents will be able to reduce significantly the amount of waste in their brown bins. These changes will mean less waste goes to landfill, which is good for the environment.\nGarden waste collections for paying residents will be extended from nine months a year to all year round. This will be collected in the same green and brown wheelie bin.\nStreet cleaning operations will be extended to 10pm from the current 6.30am start.\nThe new contracts will enable Sutton Council to save £10.3m over the first eight years. It is estimated that Sutton’s recycling rate will increase from 37 per cent (2014/15) to 42 per cent by the end of the first year of the contract.\nSutton Council has agreed to the shared service approach with its neighbours due to the unprecedented Government cuts to the Council’s budget, along with the opportunities to increase recycling rates. Currently Sutton has to save £31m from its annual budget due to Government cuts. The Council’s annual budget is £148.4m.\nACTION ON PORNOGRAPHY\nTrish is continuing her campaign to seek action on the allegations that pornographic films have been shot at locations in the Borough. She has recently been interviewed by both BBC radio and BBC television about these allegations, that pornographic films have been shot at public locations in the Borough, including one close to her home. Trish rightly said she was outraged by this, as it was an act of indecency in public, and children or other members of the public might observe it. The police should take action if they encounter such behaviour and seek additional powers if more powers are needed.\nThere is, of course, no evidence that this type of filming of obscene acts is any more prevalent in Sutton than elsewhere, as no-one is collecting data, but one has to have a concern about the people taking part in such filming (are these trafficked women?) and the possibility that such public acts of indecency might be observed by people, who will of course be horrified. And we all deplore pornography.\nGETTING YOUR FIRST CHOICE OF SECONDARY SCHOOL\nEvery borough in London is struggling to keep place with the increasing demand for school places. Sutton has done well to cope with the increased demand for primary school places. The bulge is now working its way through to secondary schools. Hence the need for Overton Grange school (the only secondary school in our Ward) to expand, and the need for a new school.\nSutton is doing well. It has the third-highest first-preference rate for secondary school places in London, with almost 80 per cent of local families receiving their first choice of school for their child – well above the London average of 68.52 per cent.\nSutton has once again achieved one of the best rates overall, with the percentage of families receiving one of their top-three preferences increasing to 94.5 per cent – up 1.5 per cent from 2015 and almost six percentage points above the London average of 88.64 per cent.\nParents in the borough have been told which secondary schools have made offers of places for their children for the September 2016 intake.\nIn September, these children will start at our secondary schools, officially ranked as being among the best in England for teaching and exam results. In 2015, the proportion of Sutton students scoring 5 or more A* to C grades including English and Maths was 76.9 per cent, well above the 2014 national average of 53.4 per cent. Across the borough, 83.5 per cent of pupils achieved five or more GCSEs.\nAlmost two-thirds (65.1 per cent) of students across the borough achieved the highest A-Level A*, A and B grades in 2015 and the percentage of Sutton students achieving an A-Level pass grade (A* to E) increased to 99.7 per cent from 98.5 per cent in 2014. This was well above the UK average.\nSCHOOL PLACES FOR LOCAL CHILDREN ASSURED\nSutton Council’s Planning Committee, which Richard chairs, has agreed expansion plans for Overton Grange school, the only secondary school in Sutton South Ward.\nSutton Council, like every London Borough, has been pursuing a strategy to cope with the increased demand for school places. Having successfully coped with a surge in demand for primary school places, the bulge is now moving through to secondary schools. The Council continues to work on its proposals for at least one new secondary school in Sutton, while almost all of the existing secondary schools – including Overton Grange – are submitting plans to expand the number of places.\nOverton Grange school is the only secondary school in our Ward and, while it takes students from all over Sutton, many local parents send their children there. Like many Sutton schools, it is planning to expand its intake to meet the additional demand for secondary school places in the Borough due to rising numbers of children. Currently the school takes in 210 students each year and it plans to expand the school by increasing its intake by a class of 30 each year from autumn 2016.\nThe school, which has “Academy” status so it is not under the control of the local authority, staged an exhibition of its building plans on 22 April, at the school. A new teaching block is proposed, and the school is taking the opportunity of the building work to expand its canteen, which is not large enough for the current size of the school.\nAt the time of the last local elections, last May, scare stories were put round that the school planned to expand into Overton Park. This is not the case.\nRichard said, after the Planning Committee decision ” The rising number of children reaching secondary school age means that expansion of our schools is necessary, alongside the proposals for new schools, and I am pleased the Council is taking effective action to avert any crisis in school places. I am pleased there is no intention to expand into the park, a story that had no foundation and was a political scare story.”\nOverton Grange plans to expand its intake by 30 pupils per year, a one form intake, from the autumn of 2016. The Planning Committee considered a report on an application for the erection of a part ground, part first, part second floor extension, to provide five additional classrooms with ancillary accommodation, three single storey extensions to provide additional canteen, kitchen and storage facilities, together with roof canopy to the main front entrance, a detached store, with soft and hard landscaping.\nOverton Grange is a popular local school and this extension will continue to ensure there are sufficient places locally for children reaching secondary school age, so this is good news for the many parents in the area who have young children. Secondary school provision in the area will be further enhanced by the decision to build the first of the new secondary schools we need on the nearby Sutton hospital site.\nONE PLANET SUTTON\nOn 15 July Sutton Council debated our on-going commitment to the sustainability agenda and Sutton’s desire to be London’s most sustainable suburb. Sutton is ranked the highest outer London Borough in having the lowest CO2 emissions.\nWe represent Sutton South Ward, which has only one open space, the Devonshire Avenue Nature Area, an oasis of open space in an area dominated by small blocks of flats, where a study showed half the children live in properties without a garden. We think it commendable that Sutton Council has ensured that this site remains a nature reserve. But a few years ago that meant leaving it as jungle. It was little used, except for anti-social happenings behind the brick walls that still occupied part of the site. Today it remains a nature area, aiding the survival of the rare small blue butterfly (a talisman of Sutton South Ward), but it has benches, paths and a nature trail. We wanted to take the opportunity the motion afforded to pay tribute to Sutton Nature Conservation Volunteers, who maintain the site, and to those who distribute the funds to aid community projects provided by the landfill operator Viridor, whose funding, in 2012, paid for the renovation of the site.\nMAJOR COMMUNITY AWARD – AND NEW EXHIBITION – FOR SUTTON SOUTH HELLO!\nOn 26 March the Sutton South Hello! Thursday afternoon group launched a major exhibition of their work at the Council’s historic museum Honeywood, in Carshalton. The launch was well attended and our picture shows Heather Honour with the Mayor of Sutton, Councillor Arthur Hookway, the Care Minister Norman Lamb MP (who launched the Hello! project on 9 May 2012, see below) and local MP Paul Burstow.\nOn 24 February 2015 Sutton South Hello! received an award in the Sutton Community Awards annual awards ceremony. This was in the “Community Spirit” category for actions that have brought the community together through community events. The photo shows the Hello! team with the certificate. Left to right the Hello! team who came up to collect the award are Colin Iddles (chair of South Sutton Neighbourhood Association), Gerry Benworth (Skill), Fran Wilson (secretary of the Hello! board), Heather Honour (Chair and Founder), Nedal Ali, Councillor Nali Patel.\nSouth Sutton Hello! is the brainchild of our former Liberal Democrat Councillor Heather Honour, an initiative to combat loneliness and isolation. It is supported by major local charities like AgeUK, Citizens’ Advice Bureau, Sutton Mental Health Foundation, and local residents’ Associations such as the South Sutton Neighbourhood Association and the Highfields Residents’ Association. Heather chairs the Board and has been the driving force behind the project.\nIt was launched at Christchurch, in Christchurch Park, on 9 May 2012 by the Care Minister, Liberal Democrat MP Norman Lamb, and is intended to be a pilot for similar initiatives elsewhere. There are now similar Hello! clubs elsewhere in Sutton, such as Worcester Park.\nSutton South Ward was chosen as, on the basis Campaign to End Social Isolation toolkit, it is a ward where the risk of social isolation is particularly high:\n– the Ward has the highest proportion of over 65’s of any Ward in Sutton\n– the proportion over 85 is double the Sutton and national average\n– there are a large number of people living in sheltered accommodation for the elderly or in single occupancy flats\n– over three quarters of residents live in purpose-built blocks of flats\n– almost half of all households are single person households\n– but a quarter of residents in the Ward say they regularly volunteer in some capacity, so there is a high level of community activism.\nThe project has drawn together a listing of the various community initiatives in Sutton South, particularly those run by the churches and AgeUK. It has produced newsletters. There are a number of specific activities it has promoted, in particular the Wednesday “Hello Club” at Christchurch and a Thursday club on craft activities. The project has been aided in setting up these activities by SCILL (Sutton Centre for Independent Living and Learning) and AgeUK\nAgeUK has assisted with the organisation of chair based exercises. Councillor Nali Patel often attends and forms a link with the Sutton and Surrey Senior Citizens Club, which meets at the Thomas Wall Centre and is in particular a friendship club for Asians living in Sutton. Other activities in the Ward include the “Second Saturday” social club for older people at the Friends’ Meeting House on the second Saturday of each month.\nAgeUK say there has been a 106% increase in callers from our Ward to its Information and Advice service since the project started promoting it. The project is seeking volunteers, particularly as befrienders. These are organised by the Sutton Centre for Independent Living and Learning (Skill). There is a phone number 0208 770 4065, or email information@scill.org.uk.\nKEEPING SUTTON CLEAN AND TIDY\nSutton Council issued a call to local people to get involved in the country’s first ever Community Clear Up Day on Saturday 21 March.\nRichard joined with other residents organised by his local residents’ association, the Highfields Residents’ Association, to help clear his local neighbourhood of litter. Richard is a former chair of the Association.\nThe Council supported volunteer groups willing to help clear their local area, by providing litter picking tools, rubbish sacks and gloves.\nAs well as being an awful blight on the green borough of Sutton, litter costs the council up to £4m a year to clean up. That is the equivalent of running a library service for a year; repairing 100,000 potholes, providing 210 residential care places for the elderly; or building half a primary school.\nThe Council successfully campaigned against litter last year – hiring two new enforcement officers to issue penalties to those who litter in Sutton; installing 300 new bins; and even displaying 11 tonnes of rubbish on the high street, to demonstrate a year’s worth of litter.\nBut there is still work to be done to keep Sutton clean and save the taxpayer money.\nTHE BEST RESTAURANT IN A HALF MILE RADIUS OF OUR WARD\nOn 6 January (Twelfth Night) Richard and his wife Gloria had lunch at “The Clink” restaurant which is in Her Majesty’s Prison High Down, in Banstead. Richard now regards this as the best restaurant within a half mile radius of Sutton South Ward.\nNegotiating the website and the security checks to get a booking at this restaurant is a challenge. We tried to go before Christmas but it was full. Today the restaurant, which can seat about 60, was fairly empty. You have to turn up early, bring lots of photo ID, not have a mobile phone on you, and be prepared to pay by cheque. It is a bit of a walk from the reception area to the main gate of the prison, where, accompanied by a warder, you are taken through numerous gates that are opened before you and locked behind you, and across various internal courtyards. When you reach the restaurant it has the ambience of a good central London restaurant, and the food is superb.\nThe restaurant is run as a training restaurant and the prisoners so trained are helped to find jobs in catering after they leave the high security prison. Richard had a Caesar salad, some duck, and a peach desert. Gloria had soup, some beautifully presented fish, and the peach desert. No alcohol of course. All for a little over £50 for two, with an option to leave a donation for the charity, devoted to the rehabilitation of offenders.\nThe restaurant can be found, and a booking made, at this address (click on “at”).\nAVOIDING FLOODING – CLEANING THE RAINWATER GULLEYS\nWork will be carried out between 24 October to 11 November to clean the gulleys in roads in our Ward. This is essential work to avoid flooding.\nThe work will require temporary waiting restrictions – ‘no waiting’ – and loading restrictions – ‘no loading / unloading’ – in those roads or lengths of roads where cleaning is taking place on the day of the cleaning. Advance notice will be given to residents three days before the restrictions are due to apply. The restrictions will be removed as soon as the works are completed. The works will take place between 7am and 2pm on Mondays to Fridays.\nThe work will require the temporary suspension of any disabled persons parking places, permit parking place, shared use permit/pay and display parking place, loading place or any other free parking place in those roads or lengths of roads that are adjacent to a drainage gulley, on the days cleaning is taking place.\nThe days the work will take place are:\n24/10/2014 Abbottsleigh Close, Audely Place, Carmborne Road and Stanley Road (between Worcester Roadand Ventnor Road).\n27/10/2014 Blackbush Close, Effingham Close, Grange Road (Overton Road to Worcester Road), Grange Vale, Tapestry Close. Upton Dene, Ventnor Road and Westmorland Drive.\n28/10/2014 Bonchurch Close, Brighton Road, ( Devonshire Avenue to Mulgrave Road), Devonshire Avenue, Devonshire Road Sutton (Langley Park Road to Devonshire Avenue).\n29/10/2014 Christchurch Park, Milestone Close, Walnut Mews and White Lodge Close\n30/10/2014 Albion Road, Downside Road. Farm Close Sutton, Farm Road, and The Ridgeway.\n31/10/2014 Ambleside Gardens, Cavendish Road, Prior Avenue and Upland Road\n10/11/2014 Cedar Road, Chalgrove Road, Eaton Road, Langley Park Road, (Chalgrove Road to Railway Bridge), Mitre Close.\n11/11/2014 Cedar Gardens, Cumnor Road, Hillcroome Road, Mayfield Road, Rutherford Close and Wellesley Road.\n12/11/2014 Coniston Gardens, Copse Hill, Eastleigh Close, Ferndown Close, Kayemoor Road, Leslie Gardens, Summers Close, Willis Avenue and Worcester Road (Overton Road to Mulgrave Road).",

He said:\n“We all know the importance to Sutton of maintaining a through rail service to north London.\nI want to stress the importance of links to St Pancras International as St Pancras develops further as an international rail hub.\nOver the next few years there will be a positive mushrooming of international rail travel from London. If the current plans of Deutschbahn and Eurostar come to fruition, by 2014 it will be possible, on arriving at St Pancras, to have a choice of services to travel from London to Amsterdam.\nIn addition to the current services to Brussels and Paris there will also be services from London to North Germany. This is a big market in terms of business travel. At present, each day, about 30 planes fly from London’s airports to destinations in north Germany, carrying about the same number of people as could be carried by just a few trains, using the Velaro D trains that are being built to provide rolling stock for these new services from London, by the train manufacturer Siemens at its Dusseldorf factory, which in fact I visited recently.\nAside from the potential importance of these international links to the residents of Sutton, there are international companies that have significant centres of their enterprises in Sutton – Sutton, a thriving London suburb, offering office space much cheaper than that found in the centre of London, less than half an hour by train from the centre, with a pleasant ambience and environment, and a location from which – importantly – you can reach the centre of Brussels in just two train journeys, one taking about 40 minutes and one about 2 hours. And the centre of Paris in just 15 minutes more. And soon – Amsterdam, north Germany.\nNow, these are transport links that it is vital for Sutton to maintain, for the sake of our residents but also to maintain our attractiveness as a centre for business development. When I look at the data on economic activity that comes regularly to the new Housing, Economy and Business committee, some clear conclusions stand out. It is clear that Sutton is doing relatively well in terms of surviving the recession and maintaining one of the highest rates of economic activity on the part of its residents of any part of London. But we need to continue to attract new businesses.\nThe Tramlink extension is perhaps equally important, particularly in relation to the north Sutton site, which is an attractive site, and on which the Housing, Economy and Business committee now has a task group working on the planning brief. Our current plans include scope for a Tramlink stop at the site, something that will greatly enhance its appeal, and we see this development as an important part of our future growth strategy.\nSo we must keep pressure on TfL to continue work on the feasibility of the Sutton Tramlink proposal, and make clear to the Department for Transport that changes that remove our linoks to north London and in particular to St Pancras, are not acceptable.\nThe Thameslink service is absolutely vital. Losing it would sever our only direct link to North London and would mean Sutton residents would need to take at least two trains to get to St Pancras. It is quite scandalous that, at a time when we should be improving public transport, there is a serious proposal to cut the link between North and South London.”\nWe need to act now as the Department for Transport is currently consulting on the new seven-year Thameslink franchise which will run from September next year and incorporate the Southern franchise from 2015.\nIronically, the cross-London Loop Line service which runs through Sutton, Carshalton and Hackbridge stations, was recently reopened at nights and weekends after being split for three and a half years by engineering work. It is all very well reopening it now, but Sutton’s residents need the line to stay open for good.\nThe new franchise will set service patterns for 2018 and beyond, so it is vital that we act now and do not become a Cinderella area for rail transport.\nTo view the DfT consultation document visit www.dft.gov.uk/consultations\nTo give your input into Sutton’s response, email alex.forrest@sutton.gov.uk\nRichard and Heather will be submitting their own response.\nMore detail about the attitude the Council is taking, opposing this threat, is in a further post on this site “Train Links To North London Must Remain” (see archive July 2011).\nHeather and Richard outside Sutton station",

It can lead to people losing their jobs if they are too far away to travel back every day. It can lead to mental breakdown, marriage breakdown, and the disruption of the education of children. Our first priority is to avoid this, and it is not too much to ask landlords to wait a week or two in some cases before a property is vacated as a last effort is made to find somewhere else to live.\nThe report commended the approach that the Council has traditionally used, and was implicitly critical of modifications to the procedure introduced in Feruary to respond to some criticisms of the approach that, the scrutiny report concluded, were not well founded.\nThis was the first scrutiny study undertaken by one of the Council’s subject committees established when governance arrangements were revised last year. The Committee studied a number of documents when it met on 19 March, and listened to a variety of views, from Council officers, from officers from a neighbouring authority (Croydon) and a landlord who voiced criticisms of the Council’s approach. It was evident from these documents that Sutton’s approach is identical to that of most, indeed almost all, London Boroughs.\nThe report describes the procedures followed by the Council. To evict a tenant from a property a landlord has to go through a legal procedure with a number of steps commencing with a notice to quit and ending with the execution of a bailiff’s warrant.\nRichard, whose daughter works for the largest charity supporting the homeless in the West Midlands, commented:\n“This is a procedure involving a private landlord and a private tenant, so it is worthwhile just reminding ourselves why the Council gets involved atall. This is because at the end of the procedure, if someone has no other accommodation and is homeless and in priority need, the obligation falls on the Council to find them accommodation. This usually means putting them in bed and breakfast accommodation, something that can be soul destroying for the family or individual concerned, and an expensive procedure involving costs that ultimately fall on our own Council tax payers.\nSo, the Council has a unit doing all in its power to assist those threatened with homelessness to find new accommodation. The report shows that in many cases they are successful, and that alternative accommodation is often found quite late in the eviction process. If they are not successful, at the end of the process the tenant will be put into bed and breakfast accommodation, but this is rightly regarded as a last resort to be undertaken when all else has failed. The process followed is described in Appendix A of the paper, and the first recommendation in the paper is to support the approach described, on the basis that this offers the best chance of minimising the numbers made homeless, thus minimising both the cost and human misery that homelessness involves, but correctly discharging the Council’s legal duties to those threatened with homelessness.\nThe criticisms of the approach, first voiced by Councillor Shields at a Council meeting, picked up by the local paper in the memorable but misleading headline “Council says wait till the bailiffs arrive”, and repeated by at least one landlord, appear to be that by waiting to the end of the process the Council runs the risk of upsetting landlords and thus discouraging landlords from working with the Council. It was also suggested that the tenants are disadvantaged by having a Court judgement against them. But the evidence in the paper (paragraphs 2.18 to 2.30) is that the Council maintains good relations with landlords, and that the Court judgement relates to possession of a property and does not affect the standing of the individual or family made homeless.\nOfficers told us, however, that for a period from February 2013 a modified approach was trialled, described in Appendix B, involving moving earlier to accept someone was homeless if it appeared that there was no realistic prospect of finding alternative accommodation. It is not often that, in assessing policy options, one can compare the outcome from two periods where different policies were tried. But the evidence in the paper (see paragraphs 2.16 and 3.8) is that the modified approach led to an increase in homelessness, as accommodation is often found for those threatened with homelessness quite late in the process.\nSo the recommendations support our continuing to follow the procedures described in Appendix A, but also call on officers to continue to work closely with landlords, keep the trends and statistics under review, and report back to us in due course.\nHomelessness – being put in bed and breakfast accommodation often far from Sutton – is a terrible experience, especially for families. I know from my casework that it can lead to people losing their jobs if they are too far away to travel back every day, to mental breakdown, to marriage breakdown, and to the disruption of the education of children. Our first priority is to avoid this, and it is not too much to ask landlords to wait a further week or two in some cases before a property is vacated as a last effort is made to find somewhere else to live.”",

Richard had prepared a speech but was not called to speak, as so many members of the public and Councillors wanted to speak. So here is what he would have said.\n“My own objections to ULEZ are because it does something that is rare in British public administration – it\ncreates massive winners and losers on a random basis, for some of the losers it is devastating, and these are ordinary families not corporations or organisations.\nTo illustrate, I have a resident who purely by chance has a car that is not ULEZ compliant, who has to travel each day to a workplace not easily accessible by public transport, and for whom the consequence of paying £12.50 a day to go to work is not supportable from his income. Selling his car is difficult as the bottom has fallen out of the market for non-compliant cars. It is difficult now to obtain a second\nhand complaint car, and the cost is prohibitive even if you can find one. The supply of new cars has been disrupted by the problems related to computer chips – I have a resident who has been on a waiting list for a year, waiting to buy a new van for his business. Re-distributing non- compliant cars does nothing to improve air quality and the replacement of old cars by new is proceeding at a pace determined by supply, so quite unaffected by ULEZ. ULEZ may lead to some trips in cars being undertaken by public\ntransport, though not so much in Sutton where the public transport infrastructure is less well developed.\nSo ULEZ will, randomly, reduce some families to poverty with at best a small effect on air quality.\nClearly a major factor is the deal Sadiq Khan made with the Government to offset part of the implications of the post-pandemic collapse in TfL finances through ULEZ, in return for Government subsidy to cover the rest. So let us be clear that the Tory Government is as much implicated\nin this as the Mayor of London. In this chamber, the only political party leading the fight and not implicated in causing the problem is the Liberal Democrats.”",

We then discussed with Council officers how to deal with the concerns raised. We noted that residents of Cedar Road had also raised concerns about speeding.\nWe obtained funding for a survey of the speed of vehicles in Cavendish Road, and got this extended to other local roads, including Cedar Road. The survey was conducted last November and December – local residents may have seen the measuring equipment (pictured above) at the roadside and with the tubes straddling the road. The traffic engineers concluded that the volume and speed of traffic in Cavendish Road has “created an environment in Cavendish Road that is perceived to be unacceptable for pedestrians and vulnerable road users to cross the road in confidence and safety.”\nIn the light of this, it is proposed to introduce traffic control measures at two locations in Cavendish Road, either a crossing with “road narrowing” build-outs from each side and one lane in the middle or a pedestrian refuge centre island. One will be close to Fiske Court and Hampton Lodge, one will be close to Richard Sharples Court.\nThe traffic engineers also concluded that the volume and speed of traffic in Cedar Road has “created an unfriendly and difficult environment for the pedestrians and the vulnerable road users to negotiate the traffic and cross the road in a safe manner.”\nAs a result, it is proposed to introduce traffic control measures at two locations in Cedar Road – a crossing with “road narrowing” build-outs from each side and one lane in the middle near Ashdown Court and Cedar Court, and a Zebra Crossing with a raised table near the Friends’ Meeting House and Forest Dean Court. The Zebra Crossing is something we have long campaigned for.\nThe precise date for this work is not yet agreed as financial restrictions mean there is no funding available till next year, but we are working to try to get the date brought forward.\nWe believe these improvements will help reduce the speeding problem and help people cross the road. We are delighted to have been able to get this result, following from the petition and the concerns raised with us by Cavendish Road and Cedar Road residents.",

  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_page_24/content_785.html": "Homeland Drive, Belmont\nIn earlier posts on this site we have set out our concerns about the proposed closure of the Grove Road and Belmont surgeries, used by many residents of our Ward, and opening of a replacement surgery in a building in Homeland Drive, in Belmont. This is of particular concern due to the high proportion of over 75s in our Ward (a higher percentage than for any other Ward in Sutton) and the lack of any GP surgery in the Ward. There is a problem of access to the site, which is poorly served by public transport.\nAt the Council’s Strategy and Resources Committee on 11 February and at the Council meeting on 3 March Richard and Heather repeated their opposition to the proposal and pressed for improvements to the proposed community transport scheme. This would go some way to ameliorating our concerns.\nIn speeches to Council on 3 March both Richard and Heather expressed concern that the doctors did not seem interested in proposals from Ruth Dombey, our Council leader, to help find a better alternative site.\nWe are writing to NHS England and continuing our campaign within the decision-taking structures of the NHS. Here is the text of Richard’s speech to Council on 3 March summarising our position.\n“Councillor Honour and I, as Councillors for Sutton South Ward, have consistently opposed the move of the two surgeries to the Henderson hospital site. Our Ward has the highest proportion of elderly residents of any Ward in Sutton and there are many residents of our Ward who go to the Grove Road or Belmont surgeries. Our objection to the site is that it is not sufficiently accessible by public transport. What has been offered by way of a community transport service, to deal with this problem, is a help but does not resolve the problem.\nThis motion applauds the efforts made by Councillor Dombey to resolve this issue, and I would like to warmly support that sentiment.\nThis is a decision taken by local doctors who work within the National Health Service. I understand from the evidence that NHS England gave to the Council’s Scrutiny Committee last year that the doctors have to put their case for the move to NHS England. Councillor Honour and I have written to NHS England to remind them of their responsibilities in this matter and ask them not to endorse this decision.\nThe local authority has come into this by the back door in three ways. First, as local planning authority, because the doctors need planning permission for the building. I sat through the discussion at the Development Control Committee and respect the fact that the Committee concluded ultimately that there were insufficient planning grounds to turn down the application. Its decisions are subject to appeal to the Planning Inspectorate so it cannot capriciously ignore the published planning policies. Second, I understand that the authority is a joint owner of the site but legal advice is that the Council would be in breach of contract were it not to proceed to completion of the sale – if the decision is taken, by the doctors and the NHS, to go ahead with this move. Third, the offer of Councillor Dombey to act as a mediator. I still hope that will be taken up.\nSo the spotlight has to focus on the decision-taking processes in the NHS.\nCouncillor Honour and I have written to NHS England to remind them of their responsibilities in this matter and urge them consider alternatives to this decision.”\nHere is the text of our letter to NHS England.\n“Unsuitable Location for Proposed GP Surgery in Sutton\nAs Councillors for Sutton South Ward in the London Borough of Sutton we are deeply concerned at proposals to close two GP surgeries and replace them with a new medical surgery at a site unsuitable for many of our residents.\nThere is at present no GP surgery in our Ward, which has the highest proportion of residents aged over 70 of any Ward in the Borough of Sutton. Our residents use a number of local surgeries but many go to the surgery at Grove Road in the centre of Sutton and to the Belmont surgery, close to Belmont railway station. These are to close, under the proposals.\nThe proposed new medical centre is in Homeland Drive, at the site of the former Henderson hospital. However, the site is not sufficiently accessible for the elderly and those without a car. It is rated PTAL 1b, which means that it is not accessible to public transport. It is in fact at least 300 metres up a steepish inclined road that is dark and uninviting. Our GPs state that 75% of patients will use a car. The remainder are likely to be elderly, unable to drive a car, or on a low income. They also are likely to be amongst the most frequent patients at the surgery.\nThere are severe limitations on the use of dial-a-ride and taxicard, so use of these services is not an option for people who find it difficult to access public transport and this site.\nThe statistics on the population of the Ward illustrate the problem. Sutton South has much more sheltered housing, and more care homes than other parts of the Borough. 2.94% of Ward residents live in managed residential accommodation compared to a Borough average of 0.78%. Over 75 per cent of properties in Sutton South are flats, many of them single occupancy. 46.3% of households in Sutton South are single person households, with 15.5% occupied by people over 65. The population of the Ward is elderly.\nSutton South Sutton average National average\nOver 65s 17.49% 14.32% 16.74%\nOver 75s 10.62% 7.07% 7.96%\nOver 85s 4.13% 2.1% 2.31%\nAlthough 73% of residents in the Borough say they are ‘well connected’, 10% of respondents in Sutton South say “they have no one to turn to locally for help”, compared to a Borough average of 6%. This means that they would not have people to assist them with transport.\nWe therefore consider that the proposed site for the new GP surgeries does not meet the needs of the most vulnerable in our Ward and we would prefer a more accessible site.\nFrom the information that we have received it does not appear that the GPs have considered the transport needs of their elderly patients, a growing demographic, who will need to use the surgery often, possibly as much as once a week for visits to the other services at the centre as well as their GPs. Many have said to us that they will need to change their doctor if this goes ahead.\nIn response to our concerns the developer of the site, Assura, has offered a community transport scheme. However, after close examination of this, it does not appear to be a practicable solution.\nOnce again the NHS, which declares that it is patient centred, is failing its patients by not taking account of their transport needs. This has been a major local issue in the abortive Better Services Better Value plans to change the status of our local hospital, St Helier.\nIt is by no means clear to us what the process is in the NHS to take a wider view of the optimum location of GP surgeries in the interests of the patients. However, we understand from evidence that NHS England gave to Sutton Council’s Scrutiny Committee last year that NHS England have a role. We would therefore like to meet you to discuss how you conside that these proposals meet the needs of our most vulnerable residents and your most needy patients.\nYours sincerely.\nRICHARD CLIFTON\nHEATHER HONOUR”",

There were new citizens from South Africa, South Korea, China, Macau (now part of mainland China), the Phillipines, a big family from India and a man from Syria, who told Richard a harrowing tale of his relatives back in Syria.

The route chosen means we are now faced with a lengthy delay and a set of formal hearings.\nThe building is an important feature of the “gateway to Sutton” from the South and Gatwick Airport.\nAfter the Criterion Capital got agreement to plans for a hotel, flats and shops at Sutherland House some years ago, they changed their mind and opted for a development involving only private flats.

Richard and Heather would like to see some affordable housing offered in this proposal, and it was this issue that was still under discussion when the developers decided to involve the Planning Inspectorate.\nThese tactics mean that the residents of Sutton South are still confronted with a dilapidated building, with shops boarded up, that drags the whole area down, and we now have to await the outcome of a long-winded formal enquiry process.\nHeather and Richard have been demanding action on the building since they were elected.\nRichard said, ” The dilapidated building pulls down the whole area.

Enforcement is a slow process with numerous opportunities for appeals and delay available to the developer.\nHe mentioned to the Committee that, when elected in 2010, he arranged some meetings between the owner and local residents, which seemed to improve the atmosphere locally for a time.

The committee has a tradition of not voting along party lines, and had indeed earlier in its meeting thrown out a planning application relating to a building in Wallington recommended by officers for approval. The planning application for Cedar Road was, however, approved, by four votes to three with four abstentions.

A further consultation exercise is about to take place on the installation of two new electric vehicle charging points in Mulgrave Road, close to the junction with Worcester Road. A preliminary consultation found majority support but few residents responded.\nThere are now charging points at the following locations:\nOpposite 49 The Ridgway\nOpposite 26 Langley Park Road\nOpposite Foxley Court in Christchurch Park\nOpposite 10 Cumnor Road\nIn Cedar Gardens\nOpposite Grange Court, Grange Road\nOpposite Thomas House, Grange Road\nOpposite 13 Stanley Road\nOpposite Fairford Court, Stanley Road\nWe want to draw attention to the Sutton Citizen space survey where residents should log their suggestions for EV charge points.\nhttps://sutton.citizenspace.com/highways-environment-and-planning/ev-survey/\nThe photo shows the first vehicle that used the first charging point in the Ward, in The Ridgway. Given the policy to ultimately phase out petrol driven vehicles, a big and continuing expansion will be needed.\nSutton Council is working with Siemens to install Ubitricity lamp column electric vehicle charging points. Ubitricity lamp column charging points are compact and fit into the door of a lamp column.\nThe aim of lamp column charging is to give residents the ability to easily charge electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles on the street where they live, especially if they do not have off-street parking or are unable to install their own home charging point. Installing residential charging points is important because a key barrier to people switching to electric vehicles is the concern around where they will be able to charge their vehicle.\nNot all lamp columns are suitable for lamp column charging points. The lamp columns need to be “electrically suitable”, be positioned near the kerb and have enough internal space to fit the charging point. They need to be sensibly located so that a vehicle could safely park and charge next to the lamp column. The lamp columns also need to be made of metal, not concrete.\nAn “earth mat”, a small metal grid, is also installed in the footway next to the lamp column. This is to make the charging point “electrically safe” if there is a fault. There are signs to indicate that the lamp column has a charging point fitted, though this sign will not prevent non-electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles from parking next to the lamp column.\nThis is a major advance in our drive to promote electric vehicles and combat global warming.",

Trish continues a s a member of the Housing, Economy and Business Committee, is elected to the Standards Committee, and will sit on the Merton and Sutton Joint Cemetery Board. Richard stands down as chair of Planning Committee and is elected Mayor for the next year.\nHere is the text of Richard’s acceptance speech.\n“I have during the six years that I have been a member of this Council served under five Mayors, three of whom are currently members of the Council. All of them did the job with great distinction. Gloria and I will do our best to continue in that tradition.\nI have many people to thank, but can I particularly thank our musicians. My good friends John, George, Rachel, Stephen and Andrew. When I was first elected to the Council there was a tradition of having some music during the natural interval that occurs in the middle of these annual meetings. It somehow lapsed but I was determined to revive it with – of course – brass musical instruments.\nLast year there was a review of the functions of the Mayor. The review report noted the long tradition in the cities, towns and boroughs of our country of the office of a Mayor, and in London the history can be traced back to 1189. But the report included proposals to bring the Mayor of Sutton into the 21st. century by promoting the Mayor through, and I quote the report, “twitter, facebook and a Mayoral blog on the Council’s website.” I hope this will become required reading for all of you and I will try to find something interesting or amusing to say each week, and you can give me marks out of ten.\nOf course, these different Mayors, stretching back to 1189, had a wide variety of ceremonial and policy functions. The promotion of charities to aid those less fortunate in life is however a recurring theme throughout, and a role of the Mayor that continues, which brings me to the subject of charities. I am pleased to be able to tell you of the two charities I propose we support this year.\nThese are Sutton Shopmobility and the Altzheimer’s Society. The Altzheimer’s society has a strong presence in Sutton and the Council has worked hard on the theme of being a dementia friendly organisation. I have a personal interest as both of my late parents had severe dementia late in life and were cared for by family members who were greatly helped by the society. And it is the families and carers who often most need most support.\nShopmobility is probably thought of by many of you as a provider of mobility scooters to help people shop in the town centre, but the organisation has a much wider role and outreach to help all those with mobility problems, and there are many in the borough who would be completely housebound without this help. And we have Councillor Patel’s mobility scooter here to show us how important it is. In the audience tonight are some representatives of the charities and I hope Councillors will want to discuss the work of these charities with them later thisevening.\nI would also like to appeal to all Councillors and indeed to everyone in this room to make a resolution to support the Mayor’s charitable appeal, and support at least one of the Mayor’s charity events this year, to support these worthy organisations.\nNow, finally, I am advised that the Mayor may appoint a Chaplin and I am delighted that the Reverend Justine Middlemiss has agreed to be my Chaplin. Justine covers a number of churches in Sutton including the splendid Victorian church, Christchurch, in my Ward, which has splendid acoustics – as I know from playing the trumpet, a small part in a big band, in the church.\nNow, Justine asked me a very pertinent question when I spoke to her about being the Mayor’s Chaplin. She asked me what do I want a Chaplin for? Well, part of the job description is to give the Mayor spiritual guidance and spiritual uplift. And being as human as everyone else, there are moments I feel a bit down and in need of spiritual uplift. Whether or not I need much spiritual uplift in the next year may depend a bit on you – I am talking to the Councillors now – and on whether you are well behaved and orderly when I come to chair these meetings.\nBut I have an advantage. For the last two years of my life I have chaired Planning Committee. And if there is any one member of the Council who sometimes needs a bit of spiritual uplift it is the chair of Planning Committee. So can I say how delighted I am that a Councillor of the calibre of Councillor Bourne is succeeding me in taking on this portfolio. She will do the job much better than I did. And Sam, if you find, as I did, that from time to time you need a bit of spiritual uplift – I will loan you Justine.\nNow in a moment, if I can dispose of the rest of the agenda with dispatch, and I know Councillors will want to help me do this, we are going to enjoy the traditional reception put on by the incoming Mayor at these annual meetings. This is not a celebration of me, Councillor Patel and Councillor Cooke moving into these positions. It is a celebration we have once a year of the civic traditions of Sutton and our shared commitment to public service to the benefit of our residents. We know that there are sometimes pointed exchanges across the floor of the Council but there is much more that unites all of us in this room than that divides us. It is a mutual respect and a mutual belief that we all share in the virtues of public service, we would not be Councillors unless we had that shared belief, and tonight I would like you to share with me a celebration of these virtues.\nThat concludes my remarks under item 5, except to say it is a great honour to be elected Mayor of the borough. I am deeply touched. Gloria and I will do everything to repay the trust you have shown in us. It will be a great year for all of us, and I sincerely thank you.”",
  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_page_36/content_444.html": "Response to the Department for Transport Combined Thameslink Franchise Consultation\nFrom Councillor Richard Clifton and Councillor Heather Honour, Liberal Democrat Councillors for Sutton South, London Borough of Sutton\n1. We are the elected Liberal Democrat Councillors for Sutton South Ward, which is just south of Sutton railway station. Passengers leaving Sutton station to the south, by the side entrance (when it is open), pass into Sutton South Ward as they leave the station.\n2. Our Ward is almost entirely residential and a significant number of our residents commute daily into central London for work. Many of these commuters use trains on the Thameslink Loop Line to travel to stations north of Blackfriars, including Farringdon and St. Pancras. Residents of the Ward also tell us they consider they benefit greatly from having a direct service to St. Pancras International, for Continental Europe, and Luton airport.\n3. For that reason we are concerned at the proposal, first set out in the London and South East Route Utilisation Strategy (July 2011), that all Sutton / Wimbledon Thameslink Loop Line trains will terminate at London Blackfriars from 2018.\n4. Terminating Wimbledon Loop services at Blackfriars would result in our residents losing their cross-London service. This will penalise those of our residents who have made their residential, employment and educational location decisions on the basis of the existence of the cross-London Thameslink service. These residents, who chose to live in Sutton South on the basis of an existing pattern of transport connections, would lose a service that they have had for many years, and based their life around.\n5. Any decision should take account of the impact of changes on the travel patterns of existing passengers, and of consequent requirements to change established travel patterns. It is because of the impact on our residents that we object to any proposal that would result in terminating Wimbledon loop trains at Blackfriars.\n6. Not only would our residents lose a through service they have come to depend on, they would lose their connection with Eurostar and domestic long distance trains at St. Pancras International and Kings Cross. Instead they would have to change trains at Blackfriars, carrying possibly heavy luggage onto already crowded trains. This movement could be particularly difficult from the western bay platform when travelling north and to either bay platform when travelling south because of the platform lengths and the position of lifts and stairs at each end of the platforms. The recent Passenger Focus passenger survey found that having to change trains was a strong disincentive to train travel.\n7. Sutton is identified in the London Plan as one of only four Metropolitan town centres in south London , with a large and growing population and employment base. It is a major business centre with many commuters and business travellers. It is therefore essential that Sutton, as a strategic south London destination, retains its connections to central and north London and beyond, and maintains its direct link to St. Pancras and the City.\n8. We also believe that the attractiveness of Sutton to employers considering re-location away from expensive offices in central London would be affected. Sutton is a location from which one can travel to Brussels with just two train journeys, one taking 45 minutes and one two hours, and the journey to Paris is only fifteen minutes longer. We have been successful in attracting businesses to Sutton and this change would have a negative impact, particularly given the expected mushrooming of international train travel from St. Pancras over the next few years. These negative effects would impact on the residents of our Ward who want to work locally in Sutton.\n9. We thus strongly object to any proposal that would result in terminating Wimbledon loop trains at Blackfriars from 2018.\n10. We are aware that Sutton Council is submitting comments, and support those comments. However, we are making this submission to draw particular attention to the impact on our residents in Sutton South Ward.\nRICHARD CLIFTON\nHEATHER HONOUR\nLiberal Democrat Councillors for Sutton South, London Borough of Sutton",

This consultation is called the Sutton Link and seeks views on bringing the tram to Sutton, or developing what is called a new Bus Rapid Transport (BRT) route. You can respond to the consultation at\nhttp://www.tfl.gov.uk/sutton-link\nCouncillor Whitehead, the Chair of Sutton Council’s transport liaison committee, and Sutton Council officers will be meeting with TfL London Buses in the New Year to discuss how bus services can be tailored to meet future development proposals in the borough. It will also provide an opportunity to raise any issues related to any shortcomings with existing services. A similar meeting has been held in previous years but Councillor Whitehead tells us a more thorough review of outer London services is now promised by TfL.\nThis is an opportunity to set out views on any changes we would like to see made to services in the area, including changes to frequencies or the duration of services, or route diversions/extensions to provide missing connections.\nOfficers will consider how this information is presented to TfL. However, the final decision on any such changes rests with TfL and there will be limited resources available.\nLocal residents in Sutton South Ward have raised with us the following concerns when consulted in the recent past.\nRoute frequency – although residents have commented that on some routes, such as route 80, frequency and reliability is good, bus 470 is seen as too infrequent, being only about every half hour.\nSimilarly, route S4 could be more frequent.\nA further difficulty with the 470 is that it does not run on a Sunday so our suggestions for the 470 are to increase the frequency from once every half an hour, run it on Sundays and (see below) extend it to Epsom hospital.\nThe X26 bus to Heathrow is used by many and the increased frequency of the X26 is welcome, but the buses have difficulty in keeping to the timetable, perhaps because of the length of the route. Some residents say they would not use it if travelling to Heathrow to catch a plane as it is not 100% reliable. There may thus be a case for increasing the frequency further.\nRoute length – could the 470 go to Epsom hospital rather than Epsom market as there are residents who use it to go to the hospital?\nOn route 151, the frequency and reliability is generally good but the service could be improved if some rush hour buses turned round at North Cheam, bearing in mind that the 213 duplicates the 151 onwards to Worcester Park.\nTimetabling – it is noted that the 80 and 280 buses running northwards along Brighton Road frequently arrive at the same time. Could the timetabling be looked at?\nPassenger information – it has been pointed out that the two bus stops in Mulgrave Road close to Sutton station do not include digital displays on bus arrival information. Although there are other ways of getting this information, on your mobile phone, not all passengers have the skill to get this.\nA review of the information arrangements was suggested for some routes. On route 164, at some stops the bus is recorded as a minute away or due but it does not turn up for six or seven minutes.\nOther matters – There has often been comment on arrangements at Sutton station. A resident suggested that congestion in Mulgrave Roadcould be alleviated by moving the taxi rank. It would be possible to move it to The Quadrant now the side entrance to the station is open, but this would probably be unpopular with the taxi drivers and railway passengers, and was not a proposal pursued under the Sutton Gateway project. A resident also commented that this part of Mulgrave Road has on occasions been briefly flooded during very heavy downpours. I have asked Council engineers to investigate.\nA summary of these comments, by bus route, is:\n470 – increase the frequency from once every half an hour, run it on Sundays and extend it to Epsom hospital\n151 – the service could be improved if some rush hour buses turned round at North Cheam, bearing in mind that the 213 duplicates the 151 onwards to Worcester Park\n80 and 280 – buses running northwards along Brighton Road frequently arrive at the same time so review the timetabling\n164 – review the information arrangements as at some stops the bus is recorded as a minute away or due but it does not turn up for six or seven minutes\nS1 – review the way the timetable is set out on the website\nS4 – review the frequency.\nIt should be noted that while this summary is focussed on suggesting improvements, many residents have commented to us in favourable terms on the frequency and reliability of local bus services.\nWe have put this digest of views forward to officers for consideration. Any decision rests, of course, with Transport for London.",

At the Sutton Council meeting on 9 May 2011 the pavilion was included in the list of buildings to be added to the Sutton Local List.\nThis is the only building in Sutton South Ward to be included on the Local List, though the Registry Office in Worcester Road is on the national list of Listed Buildings.\nThe building is the only one of the buildings put forward as additions during the consultation process to make it to the final list. This was attributed to the fact that Councillor Clifton had put forward a carefully researched case, including adequate evidence.\nThe Sutton Local List is a list of buildings thought to be of importance to the comunity, though not of sufficient merit to be “Listed Buildings” for inclusion on the national list. The list thus includes local buildings of significance to the local community. Sutton Council has been consulting on additions to the Local List and, at a presentation to the Sutton South, Cheam and Belmont Local Committee on 27 January, it became evident that not one single building in Sutton South Ward was under consideration for inclusion on the local list. This led to Councillor Clifton proposing inclusion of the pavilion.\nThe inclusion of the pavilion on the list may be helpful in the preservation of the character of this area as an Area of Special Local Character (ASLC), and thus resisting any inappropriate development in the area, such as demolition of houses and erection of blocks of flats, which has been the trend in adjacent areas. At a Planning Appeal attended by Councillor Clifton last year he had to explain to the Inspector the importance of local people of the ASLC and why it should be taken into account in the planning decision.\nCouncillor Clifton said:\n“I am delighted with this outcome. One of our key objectives, as local Councillors, is to preserve the character of the Area of Special Local Character at the east end of Sutton South Ward. We must resist the trend to knock down houses and build small blocks of flats, which has led to a shortage of family homes in many parts of Sutton South Ward, and half the children living in accommodatin with no access to a garden. This recognition of the importance of buildings such as the Edwardian tennis club to the special character of the area may be helpful to us in pursuing that objective.”\nIn proposing the pavilion, Councillor Clifton wrote:\n“It is an Edwardian tennis pavilion, built in 1908 by the local architect Percy Vere Windebank, on the triangle of land at the junction of Mayfield Road and The Ridgway, in South Sutton Ward. It is a relatively unaltered example of a small, Edwardian tennis club pavilion, though the windows have been altered in an unsympathetic manner.\nThe history of the building is interesting. Up to 1906 this area was lavender fields. Between 1906 and 1914 Windebank laid out the Highfields Estate, building what is now The Ridgway, Mayfield Road , Chalgrove Road and Hillcroome Road . The concept was an estate of large, expensive houses with large gardens, grouped around or close to a triangle of land on which there would be a lawn tennis and croquet club, for the benefit of the residents. In 2008 the Highfields Residents’ Association published a history of the estate, “Highfields 100”, to mark the centenary. A copy of this history, to which Councillor Clifton is listed as a contributor, is obtainable from Mr Keith Percy at 63 The Ridgway, SM2 5JX. The houses are of some architectural merit, as indicated in the history.\nWe believe the pavilion was built by 1908, as the Highfield Lawns tennis club was in existence by that year. On 22 August 1908 an advertisement for the first of the newly-built houses on the estate was published in the Surrey County Herald newspapers, and mentioned the private tennis club on the estate. Highfield Lawns Ltd. was established as a company by 1913 with the sole objective of owning the land in order to allow the tennis and croquet club to operate. Those who bought one of Windebank’s houses could buy shares in Highfield Lawns. The Articles of Association of the company provide, to this day, that if you own a share in the company you can only vote on its affairs if you also own property in the Highfields Estate.\nOver the years the large gardens have been sold off for infill housing, mostly of a good quality. The area is designated an Area of Special Local Character (ASLC) and the Edwardian tennis pavilion is central to the character of the area. Were it to be proposed to demolish and re-build the pavilion any replacement would need to be a building of a similar character (not a modern building or a concrete slab) due to the ASLC designation. If the Local List is a list of buildings of some local significance, the pavilion should be on the list. This is based on criteria 3, a building of significant local interest.”\nCouncillors Clifton and Honour would welcome information on any famous people who have lived in Sutton South Ward, for consideration as to whether there should be a plaque erected on the property where they lived.\nThis is a picture of the clubhouse taken from the triangle in The Ridgway. A photograph taken in 1913 shows an almost identical scene.",

It is supported by major local charities like AgeUK, Citizens’ Advice Bureau, Sutton Mental Health Foundation, and local residents’ Associations such as the South Sutton Neighbourhood Association and the Highfields Residents’ Association. Heather chairs the Board and has been the driving force behind the project.\nIt was launched at Christchurch, in Christchurch Park, on 9 May 2012 by the Care Minister, Liberal Democrat MP Norman Lamb, and is intended to be a pilot for similar initiatives elsewhere. There are now similar Hello! clubs elsewhere in Sutton, such as Worcester Park.\nSutton South Ward was chosen as, on the basis Campaign to End Social Isolation toolkit, it is a ward where the risk of social isolation is particularly high:\n– the Ward has the highest proportion of over 65’s of any Ward in Sutton\n– the proportion over 85 is double the Sutton and national average\n– there are a large number of people living in sheltered accommodation for the elderly or in single occupancy flats\n– over three quarters of residents live in purpose-built blocks of flats\n– almost half of all households are single person households\n– but a quarter of residents in the Ward say they regularly volunteer in some capacity, so there is a high level of community activism.\nThe project has drawn together a listing of the various community initiatives in Sutton South, particularly those run by the churches and AgeUK. It has produced newsletters. There are a number of specific activities it has promoted, in particular the Wednesday “Hello Club” at Christchurch and a Thursday club on craft activities. The project has been aided in setting up these activities by SCILL (Sutton Centre for Independent Living and Learning) and AgeUK\nAgeUK has assisted with the organisation of chair based exercises. Councillor Nali Patel often attends and forms a link with the Sutton and Surrey Senior Citizens Club, which meets at the Thomas Wall Centre and is in particular a friendship club for Asians living in Sutton.

There were a number of presentations and themes for discussion, after an introduction by Heather as Chair of the Steering Group.\nHeather reminded us that South Sutton Hello is an initiative to combat loneliness and isolation, supported by major local charities like AgeUK, Citizens’ Advice Bureau, Sutton Mental Health Foundation, and local residents’ Associations such as SSNA and the HRA. It is a non-political initiative with support from all political parties.\nIt was aunched at Christchurch on 9 May by the Care Minister, Norman Lamb MP and is intended to be a pilot for similar initiatives elsewhere. Sutton South Ward chosen as on the basis Campaign to End Social Isolation toolkit, it is a ward where the risk of social isolation is particularly high:\n– the Ward has the highest proportion of over 65’s of any Ward in Sutton\n– the proportion over 85 is double the Sutton and national average\n– there are a large number of people living in sheltered accommodation for the elderly or in single occupancy flats\n– over three quarters of residents live in purpose-built blocks of flats\n– almost half of all households are single person households\n– but a quarter of residents in the Ward say they regularly volunteer in some capacity, so there is a high level of community activism.\nThe project has drawn together a listing of the various community initiatives in Sutton South, particularly those run by the churches and AgeUK. It has produced a first newsletter and will follow this up with more. There are a number of specific activities it has promoted:\n– the Wednesday “Hello Club” at Christchurch run by SCILL (Sutton Centre for Independent Living and Learning)\n– Chair based exercise classes organised by AgeUK for the Sutton and Surrey Senior Citizens Club\n– The “Second Saturday” social club for older people at the Friends’ Meeting House, where attendance has increased five fold since the project started promoting it.\nAgeUK say there has been a 106% increase in callers from our Ward to its Information and Advice service since the project started promoting it.

But it transpired during the meeting that keeping the Loop Line intact would add only 28 seconds to average train times from Blackfriars, and Mr Burns told the meeting the engineering issues at Blackfriars were not insurmountable.\nRichard says “We have not yet won, But I think we can take heart from the fact that the Minister is now well aware of the issue and our strong views.

The bar is the only bar in Sutton South Ward.\nAt a hearing of the Licensing Committee on Monday 17 February in the Civic Offices in Sutton, the decision was taken to revoke the bar’s licence. Trish and Richard attended the hearing. Richard told the committee that he did not want to see the bar closed but it needed to be much better managed, as it had been in the past, to ensure there was no nuisance to local residents.\nThe bar had a Premises Licence to sell food and drink till late at night.\nDiscussion at the committee related to the four licensing objectives of:\n- Prevention of crime and disorder\n2. Protection of children from harm\n3. Public safety\n4. Prevention of public nuisance.\nThe committee was shown video evidence indicating breaches of the licence conditions, with trading outside the permitted hours, smoking in the bar, and noise problems.\nThe decision of the owner to appeal means that, in normal circumstances, the bar could continue to operate until the appeal is determined. However, the current coronavirus restrictions mean that the bar, along with other pubs, restaurants and bars, is closed. The current restrictions mean it may be a while before the appeal is determined.\nThe premises are up for sale and it is believed that there is a buyer keen to take over the bar. The buyer would, unless the appeal succeeds, have to apply for a new licence and convince the Licensing Committee that the premises will be better managed in future.\nIt is understood that the Spagetti Tree restaurant, near the bar, is taking over the vacant unit next to it (also an Italian restaurant until it closed recently).

We all see evidence of the difficult times the economy as a whole is going through, including empty retail outlets.\nYou might therefore be interested in the analysis below, taken from figures presented to the meeting held on 12 September of the Council’s Economic Development Advisory Group, of which Richard is member.\nThe figures show that Sutton has a vibrant local economy which is surviving the recession well. Data for the quarter to June 2011 show:\n• Sutton has the highest economic activity rate of any Borough in London . There are 106,500 economically active residents in the Borough, with an economic activity rate of 82.3% compared to 74.8% for London as a whole\n• The number of long-term unemployed in Sutton is falling, with the figures for June down 15% on the previous year\n• The volume of house sales and the number of planning applications (both important indicators of activity) have been rising, in the case of house sales by over 20% on the previous year’s figures. House prices have however fallen, by 2.8% on the figures for this time last year\n• The number of businesses going into administration has decreased. Business failures are of course compensated for by new local business start-ups and established companies moving into the area, on which data is less reliable\n• The percentage of vacant properties in the borough has decreased.\nThe conclusion is that Sutton is weathering the recession well. People in Sutton find it easier to find work than is the case elsewhere, and Sutton is an attractive centre for inward investment that brings development and jobs. It thus remains a growing and successful London Borough and, despite the current economic climate, is one of the most attractive places to live in the country, with good transport links to central London and beyond, plenty of green space, good leisure facilities and some of the best performing schools in the country.\nTransport links are of course vitally important to our attractiveness to investors. They also are important to the people of Sutton, many of whom commute to central London. For this reason, the threat to terminate the Capital Connect (Thameslink) services at Blackfriars, so they do not run further north of the river, is something we are personally committed to fighting. You can find a link to a petition on this issue on this website if you scroll down the posts to find “Protect Commuter Services From Sutton”.\n[…] Richard Clifton has produced a useful summary of the latest economic trends survey presented at the last Economic Development Advisory Group […]\nMuch appreciated for the information and share!\nThanks for the share!\nNancy.R",

What a pity that so much taxpayers’ money has been wasted by the BSBV team before they came to their senses.”\nCouncillor Mary Burstow, Chair of Sutton’s Scrutiny Committee, said: “Of course this is a reason to celebrate, but now we must work to secure the future of St Helier Hospital for generations of Sutton residents to come.\n“This is now a real opportunity for residents, politicians and medical staff to work out exactly how we want to see healthcare delivered in years to come.\n“And it is crucial that that discussion covers the entire capital. London’s health services need to be looked at as a whole and decisions need to be reached that meet the needs of all Londoners.”\nHowever, the uncertainty remains for hospital staff and patients, who are still unclear about what the future holds.",

Hooray.\nA further meeting of the project board guiding the Sutton Gateway project, a board on which Richard represents Sutton South Ward, heard on 25 September that good progress is being made with the scheme.\nThe most important news is that the building work on the side entrance is completed enabling the passageway from The Quadrant to be restored and the side entrance to be opened for passenger use. The side entrance is open from 7am to 7pm.The cycle racks next to the newly opened side entrance have been improved.\nWork at the front of the station commenced in September and will be completed by March 2015, but with no work over the Christmas period to avoid any inconvenience to shoppers. Some of the work will involve traffic diversions.\nThe project’s proposals to further develop the area around Sutton station include:\n– refitted shop fronts, new paving and newly planted trees to improve the look of the area\n– more lighting and CCTV cameras to make the area safer\n– extra cycling facilities, with new bike racks and shelters\n– a town centre clock\n– a new crossing in Brighton Road\n– the opening of the side entrance to Sutton station\n– new “legible London” signs\n– a re-arrangement of the bus stops to reduce congestion\n– an additional crossing for pedestrians outside the station\n– re-design of the Cedar Road / Brighton Road junction to improve visibility for motorists\n– it is not proposed to move the taxi rank, except that after 6.30 some taxis will be able to park immediately opposite the station, with the bus stop opposite the station moved further down Brighton Road and with some buses stopping in Mulgrave Road\n– there will be “live” bus information in Sutton station, subject to further research by Network Rail\n– the timing of the pedestrian crossing at the High Street / Grove Road / Sutton Court Road junction will be amended to give more time to cross\n– the number of parking spaces in the station area will be increased\n– general improvements in design and to the “public realm” around the station, with more flowers, more colour and better signage.\nThe changes, including the changes to the bus stops, will be completed by March 2015.\nThese changes are largely funded by grants the Council has obtained, not local Council tax payers.\nThe results of the earlier consultation exercise on the Gateway Project indicated general support for the scheme, but we were able to make a number of changes to respond to specific issues raised. In our Ward, a particular concern for the businesses was the need for a loading bay on Regents Parade just south of the station. We successfully lobbied for this to be incorporated into the scheme.\nOn 27 February Richard and former Ward Councillor Heather Honour organised a breakfast meeting with local businesses in our Ward to take their views on the Sutton Gateway project. Several joined us in the Rose Café in the Brighton Road, which serves excellent scrambled eggs (Richard’s breakfast). This is right in the area that is to be developed so we were able to chat and walk round the area to see the proposed changes.\nPublic consultation on the emerging proposals ran till 5 March. Consultation was by leaflets in the locality, questionnaires to members of the public, posters, newspaper advertisements, exhibitions, further “stakeholder” meetings and putting information in Sutton station.\nResidents and businesses close to the station were consulted, together with the emergency services and other groups with a major interest such as Network Rail, Southern Rail and TfL.\nAlso of great value will be the “legible London” signs at the station entrance. See the designs at\nhttp://www.tfl.gov.uk/microsites/legible-london/3.aspx\nRichard says “As a local man who for twenty years of my life commuted to central London by a route that meant I walked every working day along Wellesley Road and past the shuttered and barricaded side entrance, to enter the station from the front, it has long been an objective of mine to get the side entrance open.

These are people from all over the world who share a desire to be British citizens, and have taken examinations in the English language and in our history and way of life to obtain citizenship. On 16 December there were people from Iraq, Sri Lanka, India, Hong Kong and Rwanda. On 10 November there were people from Ethiopia, India, Nigeria,Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bulgaria, Tunisia, South Africa and Zimbabwe, all of whom had successfully applied for British citizenship. On 8 December there were people from Nepal, Sri Lanka, India, the Ukraine, South Korea, the USA and the Congo.\nRichard says “I find these ceremonies moving. Britain benefits enormously from being a multi-racial society, with so many different cultures learning from each other. These people will be a great credit to Britain, and are enthusiastic about becoming British citizens. They will bring to our country cultures and experiences that we will learn from and which will make Britain a better place.”\nThis is the text of his speech of welcome, elaborating on the standard speech normally made at this ceremony in order to draw particular attention to the many advantages of setting up home in the London Borough of Sutton, and the benefits to Sutton of the skills and experiences that people from such diverse backgrounds bring to our community.\n“It is indeed a great pleasure for me to extend my personal welcome you all, as well as welcoming you on behalf of the London Borough of Sutton and on behalf of the government of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the second.\nI am delighted that you have either chosen Sutton as a place to live or have chosen Sutton to celebrate this very special occasion.\nSutton cherishes its diversity and today we are celebrating this with all of you, people who come from many different parts of the world. You bring with you cultures and experiences which we will value, and which can help to continue to make Sutton a great place to live and to work. You have many opportunities to participate in the local community, in particular by volunteering to help in a wide range of groups and activities where your expertise and experience would be invaluable to the community.\nMany of you have children. Sutton is proud to have excellent schools and opportunities for our young people. We look to inspire young people so they develop and thrive in a learning environment. This year students at Sutton schools achieved the best GCSE results in the country.\nA recent study rated Sutton as the best place in London to bring up children. The study looked at factors such as low crime rates, affordability of houses, earnings and access to good schools, and concluded that Sutton is the best Borough in London to set up home. So, for those of you who have set up home in Sutton, congratulations on making such a wise choice.\nSutton is also the Borough with the highest percentage of residents in work – 78% of Sutton’s working age population has a job, and there is evidence that in this period of recession Sutton remains vibrant.\nThe green spaces and parks in Sutton enable everyone to enjoy their leisure time. Sutton is proud of its “green” environment – having over 1 500 acres of parks and open spaces and over 20 000 street trees. There is also a wide range of other facilities in the Borough such as libraries, theatres, and the Life centre, which encourages citizenship and learning.\nHistorically Sutton has been linked to the Queens and Kings of England. King Henry 8th was frequently a visitor to the Borough having a home in Nonsuch park.\nThis house that we are in today is a fine example of Victorian architecture, once inhabited by the Walls family, a name you may recognise, famous for their Walls Ice Cream and Walls Sausages. But there are many other heritage sites worthy of a visit including Whitehall in Cheam and The Honeywood centre in Carshalton. Since 1965 this building has been the Register office, registering important life events such as births, deaths marriages, civil partnerships and – today – people choosing to take British citizenship.\nAs we look across the world and realise how fortunate we are to live in a democracy, I urge you all as new citizens to use the opportunity to vote in our elections, to shape the future of the Borough and your new country. Your next opportunity to do that will be in May, when we elect a new Mayor of London and a London Assembly.\nMay I congratulate you all and wish you happiness and success as new British Citizens. “\nThis is Richard with the Registrar, who conducted the ceremony.",

Following a meeting with residents last January, we agreed to pursue proposals to remove yellow lines on one side of a stretch of Blackbush Close to provide more parking spaces. This is now likely to go ahead in the New Year.\nEASTLEIGH CLOSE – residents have been concerned at the difficulty of parking in their own cul-de-sac, as it is often parked up with the vehicles of people who do not live in the Close. The concerns of residents led to a major survey of views on parking across the whole of the west end of our Ward, in early 2012. The results indicate a desire for parking controls in Eastleigh Close but not elsewhere. It is proposed to hold a final consultation on a proposal to extend the Controlled Parking Zone from its current boundary at the east end of Camborne Road as far as the junction with Stanley Road, taking in Eastleigh Close.\nLORRAINE COURT, CAMBORNE ROAD – some residents were concerned at the difficulty of exiting into Camborne Road if cars were parked close to and thus narrowing the entrance.

The inspiration for the wooden play equipment came from the NT installation at Box Hill. Our letter explains all and reads as follows:\n“Dear National Trust.\nIn a world of grant applications and “evidencing” everything, we thought you would find the following useful.\nThe children’s natural play area in Box Hill has been imitated.\nWe now have similar play equipment in the Devonshire Avenue Nature Area (DANA) in the London Borough of Sutton.\nThis tiny, one acre reserve is surrounded by blocks of flats. The nearest playground for children is over a mile away. But the nature area is home to the very rare small blue butterfly. There was an inevitable conflict between the conservationists, who wanted no “nasty modern looking stuff that looks like it has come from Disney land” and local families desperate for somewhere to take their children.\nWe were able to show that the National Trust have achieved that balance at Box Hill. Using your play area as inspiration we were able to work with the locals and the conservationists to achieve a happy compromise.\nThe result, we hope is a much improved Nature Area, where more children come to play and the precious small blue butterfly is still protected.

  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_author_richardclifton_page_24/content_856.html": "In earlier posts on this site we have set out our concerns about the proposed closure of the Grove Road and Belmont surgeries, used by many residents of our Ward, and opening of a replacement surgery in a building in Homeland Drive, in Belmont. This is of particular concern due to the high proportion of over 75s in our Ward (a higher percentage than for any other Ward in Sutton) and the lack of any GP surgery in the Ward. There is a problem of access to the site, which is poorly served by public transport.\nAt the Council’s Strategy and Resources Committee on 11 February and at the Council meeting on 3 March Richard and Heather repeated their opposition to the proposal and pressed for improvements to the proposed community transport scheme. This would go some way to ameliorating our concerns.\nIn speeches to Council on 3 March both Richard and Heather expressed concern that the doctors did not seem interested in proposals from Ruth Dombey, our Council leader, to help find a better alternative site.\nWe are writing to NHS England and continuing our campaign within the decision-taking structures of the NHS. Here is the text of Richard’s speech to Council on 3 March summarising our position.\n“Councillor Honour and I, as Councillors for Sutton South Ward, have consistently opposed the move of the two surgeries to the Henderson hospital site. Our Ward has the highest proportion of elderly residents of any Ward in Sutton and there are many residents of our Ward who go to the Grove Road or Belmont surgeries. Our objection to the site is that it is not sufficiently accessible by public transport. What has been offered by way of a community transport service, to deal with this problem, is a help but does not resolve the problem.\nThis motion applauds the efforts made by Councillor Dombey to resolve this issue, and I would like to warmly support that sentiment.\nThis is a decision taken by local doctors who work within the National Health Service. I understand from the evidence that NHS England gave to the Council’s Scrutiny Committee last year that the doctors have to put their case for the move to NHS England. Councillor Honour and I have written to NHS England to remind them of their responsibilities in this matter and ask them not to endorse this decision.\nThe local authority has come into this by the back door in three ways. First, as local planning authority, because the doctors need planning permission for the building. I sat through the discussion at the Development Control Committee and respect the fact that the Committee concluded ultimately that there were insufficient planning grounds to turn down the application. Its decisions are subject to appeal to the Planning Inspectorate so it cannot capriciously ignore the published planning policies. Second, I understand that the authority is a joint owner of the site but legal advice is that the Council would be in breach of contract were it not to proceed to completion of the sale – if the decision is taken, by the doctors and the NHS, to go ahead with this move. Third, the offer of Councillor Dombey to act as a mediator. I still hope that will be taken up.\nSo the spotlight has to focus on the decision-taking processes in the NHS.\nCouncillor Honour and I have written to NHS England to remind them of their responsibilities in this matter and urge them consider alternatives to this decision.”\nHere is the text of our letter to NHS England.\n“Unsuitable Location for Proposed GP Surgery in Sutton\nAs Councillors for Sutton South Ward in the London Borough of Sutton we are deeply concerned at proposals to close two GP surgeries and replace them with a new medical surgery at a site unsuitable for many of our residents.\nThere is at present no GP surgery in our Ward, which has the highest proportion of residents aged over 70 of any Ward in the Borough of Sutton. Our residents use a number of local surgeries but many go to the surgery at Grove Road in the centre of Sutton and to the Belmont surgery, close to Belmont railway station. These are to close, under the proposals.\nThe proposed new medical centre is in Homeland Drive, at the site of the former Henderson hospital. However, the site is not sufficiently accessible for the elderly and those without a car. It is rated PTAL 1b, which means that it is not accessible to public transport. It is in fact at least 300 metres up a steepish inclined road that is dark and uninviting. Our GPs state that 75% of patients will use a car. The remainder are likely to be elderly, unable to drive a car, or on a low income. They also are likely to be amongst the most frequent patients at the surgery.\nThere are severe limitations on the use of dial-a-ride and taxicard, so use of these services is not an option for people who find it difficult to access public transport and this site.\nThe statistics on the population of the Ward illustrate the problem. Sutton South has much more sheltered housing, and more care homes than other parts of the Borough. 2.94% of Ward residents live in managed residential accommodation compared to a Borough average of 0.78%. Over 75 per cent of properties in Sutton South are flats, many of them single occupancy. 46.3% of households in Sutton South are single person households, with 15.5% occupied by people over 65. The population of the Ward is elderly.\nSutton South Sutton average National average\nOver 65s 17.49% 14.32% 16.74%\nOver 75s 10.62% 7.07% 7.96%\nOver 85s 4.13% 2.1% 2.31%\nAlthough 73% of residents in the Borough say they are ‘well connected’, 10% of respondents in Sutton South say “they have no one to turn to locally for help”, compared to a Borough average of 6%. This means that they would not have people to assist them with transport.\nWe therefore consider that the proposed site for the new GP surgeries does not meet the needs of the most vulnerable in our Ward and we would prefer a more accessible site.\nFrom the information that we have received it does not appear that the GPs have considered the transport needs of their elderly patients, a growing demographic, who will need to use the surgery often, possibly as much as once a week for visits to the other services at the centre as well as their GPs. Many have said to us that they will need to change their doctor if this goes ahead.\nIn response to our concerns the developer of the site, Assura, has offered a community transport scheme. However, after close examination of this, it does not appear to be a practicable solution.\nOnce again the NHS, which declares that it is patient centred, is failing its patients by not taking account of their transport needs. This has been a major local issue in the abortive Better Services Better Value plans to change the status of our local hospital, St Helier.\nIt is by no means clear to us what the process is in the NHS to take a wider view of the optimum location of GP surgeries in the interests of the patients. However, we understand from evidence that NHS England gave to Sutton Council’s Scrutiny Committee last year that NHS England have a role. We would therefore like to meet you to discuss how you conside that these proposals meet the needs of our most vulnerable residents and your most needy patients.\nYours sincerely.\nRICHARD CLIFTON\nHEATHER HONOUR”",

However, the statement is confused and we await sight of the Regulations to be made nder the Act to really understand what is now the position. The Minister indicated that, in respect of extensions that would otherwise require planning permission but these proposals wanted to exempt, the occupier would need to provide a written description and a plan of the proposed development and give it to the local planning authority. The owner or occupier of any land or property “adjoining” the property where the changes are to be made will be notified of the proposed development and of the period they have to object. The local planning authority will then consider whether it will have an unacceptable impact and if a planning application is needed.\nThe statement quoted figures of 6 metres and 4.5 metres and says these provisions will be repealed in April 2016. This is consistent with Government statements that the objective was to create work for builders as a temporary provision to increase economic activity. We have always disputed that it would have such an effect, and that any such effect would be at the expense of neighbour disputes and the erection of ugly buildings. We assume the current proposal involves a return to the status quo in April 2016",

See articles further down on crime and policing in our Ward.\nTrish, Richard and Louise at the Devonshire Avenue Nature Area\nWELCOME TO OUR SITE\nOur site aims to tell you the latest news about Sutton South Ward and our work as your local Councillors.\nAS LOCAL COUNCILLORS WE AIM TO KEEP SUTTON A GREAT PLACE TO WORK, LIVE AND RAISE A FAMILY, AND TO PRESERVE THE PLEASANT, GREEN, SUBURBAN FEEL OF SUTTON SOUTH WARD.\nWHAT WE VALUE ABOUT SUTTON IS:\ngood schools\nmore affordable housing than in many London boroughs\neasy access to the countryside and to the centre of London\na pleasant, green, suburban atmosphere\nlower levels of crime than is typical in outer London.\nRichard and Trish on the top of the Subsea7 building during its construction\nRichard was first elected to Sutton Council in 2010, and was re-elected in 2014, 2018 and 2022. Trish was first elected in 2014 and was re-elected in 2018 and 2022. Louise was elected in 2022. Richard served as Mayor of Sutton for 2016-17 and Trish was our Mayor for a record three yearly terms, to May 2023. Louise is our Deputy Mayor for a second successive year, through to May 2025.\nLouise, Richard and Trish at City Hall presenting the petition opposing ULEZ signed by over 10 000 Sutton residents\nCONTINUE DOWN THE PAGE TO OUR CURRENT NEWS STORIES\nOR CLICK ON THE LINKS BELOW TO GO TO OUR SPECIFIC PAGES\nThe statue “The Messenger” by David Wynne, in The Quadrant, is close to the boundary between our Ward and Sutton Central Ward\nOn 10 April there was a remarkable victory for the Liberal Democrat candidate, Richard Choi, in a by-election to elect a Councillor for Sutton Central Ward on Sutton Council. Sutton Central Ward is immediately north of our Ward, Sutton South.\nRichard got more votes than all the other six candidates added together. The result was\nLiberal Democrats 1291\nConservatives 327\nReform 282\nLabour 216\nThree other candidates (the Greens, an independent and the Christian People’s Alliance) each got less than 100 votes.\nThe Liberal Democrat share of the vote increased by 17.4%, the Conservatives fell by 10% and Labour – who finished second in this seat in 2022 – by 17.4%.\nOn 3 March the Council discussed the budget proposals for the coming year. Legally, the Council is required to set a balanced budget. With so many Councils going bust or in great financial difficulty, this was always going to be a difficult task. The problems are due to a legacy of Government cuts but also a big spike in demand for services. While people think of the Council as the body that mends the potholes, empties the bins and fixes the street lights, 70% of spending is on adult social care and children’s services (particularly for those children with special educational needs), plus the cost of finding accommodation for the homeless. There has been an increase in demand in the past year, particularly in the number of adults whose social care has to be paid for by the Council, the number of children with special educational needs and in the number of homeless families.\nRichard spoke in the debate, on homelessness – a subject in which he has a special interest due to the work history of his daughter, Ellie, who worked for many years for a homelessness charity and because as chair of Planning Committee he has a role in increasing the supply of affordable family accommodation.\nHere is Richard’s speech:\n“I would like to direct the attention of Council to paragraph 8.11 of the supplemental agenda which is discussing financial risks.\nIt says that the biggest driver of overspending by London boroughs is the number of people presenting as homeless and who need to be offered temporary accommodation.\nThe paper tells us Sutton had 1 084 households homeless and in temporary accommodation in October last year. It is a higher figure tonight. It is a frightening figure. Tonight we are discussing homelessness as a financial risk to the Council, but we all recognise that the fundamental reason for our concern is that behind so many of these cases are stories of tragedy, of families losing their homes and often winding up in bed and breakfast accommodation remote from their workplace and remote from the schools their children attend.\nThere is a housing crisis and we need more homes. Residents comment on the number of new flats being built in the centre of Sutton but we need this accommodation.\nThe aspiration of the Government to build more homes is right – but it has to be tempered by a concern about quality and about dealing with the consequences.\nSutton is very built up. It is not always easy to see where the new homes will come from, particularly when we are all rightly sensitive to the concerns of residents about inappropriate development and the pressures intensification can bring.\nIt is worthwhile re-stating the principles in our local plan for Sutton.\nWe need more housing, but it must be of good quality – good enough for Sutton, which means of high quality.\nWe aim to reduce development pressures on what I call the “suburban heartland” of the borough by concentrating development in the areas where development is appropriate.\nIn particular there is a zone of potential intensification close to the town centre where public transport connections are good. This may mean some tall buildings. It may mean car free or car light development as you can provide much more accommodation if you do not have to provide a parking space for every unit, and this is more acceptable in areas close to the railway station and the town centre where public transport connections are good.\nWe have a local plan, currently under review, which sets out how we meet the requirements for infrastructure to support an increase in population, which is an important concern of residents.\nI am always keen to point out that our local plan is not like the local plan you might find in, for example, North Korea, mandating what will be built. It is aspirational. It depends on developers bringing forward proposals. Its success depends a lot on the skills of our planning staff in negotiating with developers to secure what is good for Sutton, which may not be what makes most profit for the developer. I would like to pay tribute to the work of our planning staff and in particular the head, Andy Webber, who retires this month.\nIn the past year the planning system has had a bad press. The Government says we are going for growth, growth, growth. Quite right. But when asked what are the impediments to growth they invariably cite the planning system – which is represented as run by NIMBYS frustrating necessary development. That might well be the case in some places – not here in Sutton of course. But I think there is a counter argument that the planning system is a bastion against having fields and fields of sub-standard housing, as that is what makes money for developers. We destroy the planning system at our peril. But it is also right that we need a planning system that does not stand in the way of necessary change and renewal, but ensures high quality and appropriate development, to provide housing and to stimulate the economy.\nI think we have a good track record in Sutton in supporting high quality development and there are many examples in our borough of developments characterised by good design providing quality housing and infrastructure. That is what we need.”\nThe bench at the junction of The Ridgway and Mayfield Road\nThere are a number of locations in our Ward where there are benches to enable weary pedestrians to put up their feet. At the most recent meeting of the Council’s local committee we got agreement to re-new two benches in the Ward that have deteriorated over time. These are benches in Copse Hill and the one in the photograph, which is at the junction of The Ridgway and Mayfield Road.\nThere is a history to some of the benches in our Ward. In 1988 the South Sutton Neighbourhood Association celebrated the tenth anniversary of its foundation by funding a bench in Cavendish Road close to Ambleside Gardens. The bench was, after over twenty years of use and exposure to the elements, in a very sorry state. We took action to get the bench restored, with the plaque explaining the history of the bench moved to the new bench.\nOn the 27th of January Sutton Council met. Richard raised the issue of the reasons why a recent survey by The Times newspaper ranked Sutton as the eighth most attractive place to live in England. This finding does not surprise us. We spend a lot of time knocking on the doors of our residents to introduce ourselves as your local Councillors and we find people generally say they really like Sutton, mentioning a strong sense of community, open spaces, low crime, good schools, a green and pleasant environment, parks, street trees, being convenient for London and for the countryside. This is particularly the case with people who have moved to Sutton from elsewhere, particularly those from other London boroughs, from Hong Kong and from Ukraine. Please write to us and tell us what you like about Sutton or think we can improve.\nWe are always keen to look at ways of improving our Ward.\nLast year traffic engineers undertook a study of traffic flows in our Ward and the results of the exercise are listed in a later post on this site. The results have not led to some “standout” conclusion as to a problem that needs tackling but traffic officers are examining three main issues:\nwhether action can be taken to improve the safety and the experience of pedestrians crossing the Kings Lane bridge without closing the road to vehicles. The bridge is narrow. Installing a second bridge would be impossibly expensive. Marking a pedestrian path at one side of the road might be feasible. We would welcome the views of users of the bridge, both pedestrians and motorists\nsimilarly, whether something can be done to improve the safety and the experience of pedestrians passing under the railway bridge in Langley Park Road. Some proposals are to be consulted on\npossible improvements to the busy junction where Cedar Road crosses Langley Park Road. Residents have spoken to us of the difficulties pedestrians have in crossing Langley Park Road. Consultation with residents in adjacent streets is underway on proposals to install two new traffic islands in Langley Park Road. These will form a safe area in the middle of the road so the road can be crossed by pedestrians in two phases.\nYour views on these issues, and views on any other traffic and parking issues you would like us to look at would be welcomed.\nThe police met residents of Sutton South Ward again on the evening of 15 January 2025, at Devonshire Avenue school. There are open, public meetings held quarterly at which the police discuss the policing of the Ward with local residents. We were addressed by our Ward Constable, Constable Robyn Skivens, who went through the crime statistics for the Ward. Sutton has a lower crime rate than most outer London boroughs and our Ward has one of the lowest crime rates in Sutton. However, crime always has a significant impact on the victim and public concern remains high. The draft minutes of the meeting are as below.\nSUTTON SOUTH COMMUNITY / POLICE MEETING. 15 JANUARY 2025 Attended by PC Robyn Skivens and PCSO Helen Maguire for the police. A report was given on main crime trends from 1 September to the date of the meeting. DRUG OFFENCES There had been 18 drug offences, mainly possession of drugs, mainly cannabis. While this was higher than normal the increase was partly attributable to a special police operation at Sutton train station. Four of these crimes were the interception by the Border Force of drug shipments. Where such a shipment is to premises in our Ward it will count in our statistics. BURGLARY There had been 21 burglaries or attempted burglaries. This included residential burglaries, burglaries of garages and sheds, and some burglaries of businesses. It was noted that there was usually a seasonal increase in burglary at this time of year as it was darker earlier. There had been eight residential burglaries. However, some that had been reported in sheltered accommodation in the Ward were later disproved and attributed to dementia. A disturbing case was that of a landlord who was able to let himself into a flat and commit theft. Two burglaries of garages had involved theft of bicycles. Mention was made of a shop in Brighton Road where the window was smashed and the wooden panel that was then put in place to secure the premises was pulled away to facilitate burglary. Mention was made of the theft of tools from a construction site in the Ward. Some burglaries had involved the theft of keys, which were then used to commit further offences (theft of a car key leading to theft of a car). The police stressed the need to make sure keys were kept out of sight – if the keys can be seen from your letterbox you are inviting crime.\nVEHICLE CRIME\nThere had been 14 instances of vehicle crime (theft of vehicles, damage to vehicles, theft from vehicles). The police stressed the need to avoid leaving anything of value on display in your car, or in the car at all. An unusual crime had been the theft of an excavator and a dumper from the road works in Brighton Road. THEFT There had been 23 crimes in a category the police described as “theft and kindred (to theft)” events. This included shoplifting, parcel theft, theft of pedal cycles and mobile phones. Examples mentioned included theft of scrap metal, theft of a wheelie bin and theft of a wedding ring by distraction techniques. MAJOR CRIMES There had been nine major, violent crimes in the Ward. This included several robberies at the train station, a large group altercation outside a restaurant, a fight between two drug users, and a concerning incident of a woman who was followed from the station and robbed. There were also two incidents of arson, of a bin and of a Ford transit. A ULEZ camera was deliberately damaged. There was an incident where a drug user was searched and a knife, and bladed articles, were found to be in his possession. There was a disturbing incident of an anti-semitic symbol being daubed on a wall outside the synagogue in Cedar Road. There had been a succession of incidents related to a woman living in Cedar Road who had engaged in anti- social activities that had attracted a community of drug users to her premises. This was now the subject of police reports to the DPS that were expected to lead to her being charged with serious offences. SPEEDING The police had been conducting a programme of visits to local care homes and sheltered housing to talk about scams. Residents had raised with them concerns about speeding in Cavendish Road, which had led to police action in that road. There was a discussion of speeding in local roads including Chalgrove Road, Langley Park Road, The Ridgway and Cavendish Road. The police had been carrying out speed checks in Chalgrove Road and Cavendish Road. The action in Cavendish Road had led to twelve drivers receiving warnings. The police would consider further action against speeding in local roads, subject to resources.\nOTHER MATTERS DISCUSSED Staffing levels: There should be in theory be a third officer on the Ward to support Robyn and Helen, but they were coping. The number of “extractions” when they were called away to join police exercises elsewhere in London, or at the Croydon custody suite, remained an issue of concern but was now running close to 35% of their time rather than the 50% it had once been. Mention was made of local concern about a story that a body had been discovered at a house in Egmont Road. The police assured the meeting that there was no wider implication of this incident. The next meeting was tentatively scheduled for Wednesday 14 May at Devonshire Avenue school (7pm) subject to the police checking their work rota. The meeting thanked Robyn for coming back from leave to attend the meeting and thanked the officers for their work for the community in dealing with crime in the Ward. The meeting thanked Fiona Ostler for letting us meet at the school. The date of the next meeting was provisionally set as Wednesday 14 May, at Devonshire Avenue primary school and thought continues to be given to what could be done to better publicise the meeting and get a better attendance.\nConstable Skivens, Louise, Trish and Richard with other Ward police officers at the Sutton South Hello Christmas party\nThe Phoenix Concert Band – which is based in our Ward and for which Richard plays trumpet – were busy over the Christmas period raising money for the Mayor of Sutton’s charity appeal. The band practices every Friday in the church at Christchurch in Christchurch Park. A concert in the church, staged by the band in December, drew an audience of over a hundred and raised £790 for the charity appeal. The band also played Christmas carols at an event in the Straw cafe in Manor Park in December, which raised £360. On the last Saturday before Christmas the band joined a wider group of musicians to play Christmas carols in the atrium of the St Nicholas shopping centre in Sutton (see photo) which raised £180, so £1330 in all. We were grateful to the Mayor, Councillor Colin Stears, who attended all these events. In addition the band played a concert at the Friends’ Meeting House in Cedar Road on the second Saturday in December, to entertain an enthusiastic audience before the “Second Saturday Tea” which the Quakers provide every month on the second Saturday. The Mayor of Sutton’s charities are Home-Start, Sutton, and Sutton, Kingston and Epsom – Parkinson’s UK. Our contribution to the appeal was dwarfed by the £10 000 prize for second place in the boroughs’ competition won by the Sutton float in the London New Year’s Day parade.\nWe pride ourselves on the fact that we have a network of dedicated volunteers who deliver our “FOCUS” magazine throughout the Ward. If you have the odd half hour a few times a year to support us in this way please contact us. We recently prepared an end of year newsletter to update our volunteer deliverers on our activities. We thought we would share it with those who look at our website.\n“The last year has been our most successful year in Sutton South Ward. With the election of Luke as our Member of Parliament in July we have, for the first time, three Liberal Democrat Councillors representing our Ward and a Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament representing us at Westminster. We held a successful Ward meeting on 28 November where we heard from Luke on the incredibly busy life he now has as our Member of Parliament. He has been meeting all the important community groups in Sutton and Cheam, and has made speeches in Parliament on a variety of issues – ranging from the importance of support for carers to the future of Taiwan. In his maiden speech he spoke about what a pleasant place Sutton is to live, work and raise a family, a great change from the previous MP who spent all his time running Sutton down. He is enthusiastic about his role as spokesperson for London. As Ward Councillors, we have a lot of local casework that we deal with and are doing more than our fair bit as Chairs of Council committees – Trish chairing the Audit and Governance Committee, Richard the Planning Committee and Louise combining being chair of the Licensing Committee with her role as Deputy Mayor. This is her second year as Deputy Mayor following the three years during which Trish was Mayor.\nLike every local authority, Sutton Council is pre-occupied by financial issues and struggling with some difficult decisions to balance the books. The decision to close the Registrar’s office (The Russetings) in Worcester Road was one we regretted, driven by a need to consolidate services in fewer buildings, but we believe planning controls are sufficient to protect the appearance of this attractive, locally listed, building in the street scene.\nWe have secured funding for improvements to the WArd, including new information signs at the only open space in our Ward – the Devonshire Avenue Nature Area (DANA). Maintenance of the nature area involves a balance of ensuring it is a peaceful place for people to visit while preserving the biodiversity of the site. There is now a Friends of DANA group – let us know if you would like to join it. We are already looking forward to our next electoral challenge, to retain control of the Council in 2026. We need to keep up the work of talking to our residents, delivering our literature and doorknocking. Let us know if you are interested in being one of our candidates. We welcome talking or corresponding with you and with all our residents. We hope to have further Ward meetings next year. We are really grateful for the help we get.”\nSutton South Councillors were concerned to learn about changes proposed to the organisation of the Police Cadets, who meet at a school in our ward. Currently there are over 120 cadets. However, the decision has been made to close junior cadets and cut the remaining senior cadets to just 46. Their future programme is also being severely curtailed. This will have a major impact on the youth of this borough who will no longer have the opportunity to participate in activities such as camps, parades and Duke of Edinburgh awards.\nCouncillor Louise Phelan, whose son has been a Cadet, commented “I’ve seen first-hand the benefits of being part of police cadets. They learn valuable life skills, and gain self confidence. They also support the local community and get to take part in things they wouldn’t otherwise have had the opportunity to do. For many this is a stepping stone into a career within the police force, for others the Cadets help to keep them on the right path and make better life decisions. I am incredibly concerned others will now not get these opportunities.”",

This consultation is called the Sutton Link and seeks views on bringing the tram to Sutton, or developing what is called a new Bus Rapid Transport (BRT) route. You can respond to the consultation at\nhttp://www.tfl.gov.uk/sutton-link\nCouncillor Whitehead, the Chair of Sutton Council’s transport liaison committee, and Sutton Council officers will be meeting with TfL London Buses in the New Year to discuss how bus services can be tailored to meet future development proposals in the borough. It will also provide an opportunity to raise any issues related to any shortcomings with existing services. A similar meeting has been held in previous years but Councillor Whitehead tells us a more thorough review of outer London services is now promised by TfL.\nThis is an opportunity to set out views on any changes we would like to see made to services in the area, including changes to frequencies or the duration of services, or route diversions/extensions to provide missing connections.\nOfficers will consider how this information is presented to TfL. However, the final decision on any such changes rests with TfL and there will be limited resources available.\nLocal residents in Sutton South Ward have raised with us the following concerns when consulted in the recent past.\nRoute frequency – although residents have commented that on some routes, such as route 80, frequency and reliability is good, bus 470 is seen as too infrequent, being only about every half hour.\nSimilarly, route S4 could be more frequent.\nA further difficulty with the 470 is that it does not run on a Sunday so our suggestions for the 470 are to increase the frequency from once every half an hour, run it on Sundays and (see below) extend it to Epsom hospital.\nThe X26 bus to Heathrow is used by many and the increased frequency of the X26 is welcome, but the buses have difficulty in keeping to the timetable, perhaps because of the length of the route. Some residents say they would not use it if travelling to Heathrow to catch a plane as it is not 100% reliable. There may thus be a case for increasing the frequency further.\nRoute length – could the 470 go to Epsom hospital rather than Epsom market as there are residents who use it to go to the hospital?\nOn route 151, the frequency and reliability is generally good but the service could be improved if some rush hour buses turned round at North Cheam, bearing in mind that the 213 duplicates the 151 onwards to Worcester Park.\nTimetabling – it is noted that the 80 and 280 buses running northwards along Brighton Road frequently arrive at the same time. Could the timetabling be looked at?\nPassenger information – it has been pointed out that the two bus stops in Mulgrave Road close to Sutton station do not include digital displays on bus arrival information. Although there are other ways of getting this information, on your mobile phone, not all passengers have the skill to get this.\nA review of the information arrangements was suggested for some routes. On route 164, at some stops the bus is recorded as a minute away or due but it does not turn up for six or seven minutes.\nOther matters – There has often been comment on arrangements at Sutton station. A resident suggested that congestion in Mulgrave Roadcould be alleviated by moving the taxi rank. It would be possible to move it to The Quadrant now the side entrance to the station is open, but this would probably be unpopular with the taxi drivers and railway passengers, and was not a proposal pursued under the Sutton Gateway project. A resident also commented that this part of Mulgrave Road has on occasions been briefly flooded during very heavy downpours. I have asked Council engineers to investigate.\nA summary of these comments, by bus route, is:\n470 – increase the frequency from once every half an hour, run it on Sundays and extend it to Epsom hospital\n151 – the service could be improved if some rush hour buses turned round at North Cheam, bearing in mind that the 213 duplicates the 151 onwards to Worcester Park\n80 and 280 – buses running northwards along Brighton Road frequently arrive at the same time so review the timetabling\n164 – review the information arrangements as at some stops the bus is recorded as a minute away or due but it does not turn up for six or seven minutes\nS1 – review the way the timetable is set out on the website\nS4 – review the frequency.\nIt should be noted that while this summary is focussed on suggesting improvements, many residents have commented to us in favourable terms on the frequency and reliability of local bus services.\nWe have put this digest of views forward to officers for consideration. Any decision rests, of course, with Transport for London.",
  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_2021_07_08_well-done-sutton/content_246.html": "On the day England qualified for the final of the European football championship, 7 July, Richard attended a meeting of Sutton Council’s Planning Committee, where we approved the proposals of Sutton United for a new stand, floodlights and a grass pitch, following their promotion to the English football league. Well done Sutton! Richard made a speech recollecting that in 2017 the club had, for the first time ever, reached the fifth round of the FA Cup, playing Arsenal at home. He was Mayor of Sutton at that time and attended the match. The facilities at the ground need upgrading, so he was delighted with these proposals for renovation. This puts Sutton on the map. Now that Barnet have dropped out of the football league, Sutton is the only one of the 32 London boroughs that people will regularly hear of, as a borough with a football league club that has the same name.",

Again, the police were able to present statistics showing a fall in crime in the Ward.\nThere is a full report on the meeting on the page on this site titled “Sutton Police.”",
  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_2015_12_20_satisfaction-with-the-council-has-increased-survey-shows/content_775.html": "Almost 8 in 10 people feel Sutton Council is doing a good job and 9 in 10 are satisfied with their local area as a place to live, an independent borough-wide survey has found.\nThe data comes from an independent bi-annual survey commissioned by the council to analyse public perception of the borough. This year the survey was carried out by M.E.L Research, which surveyed 1,022 residents aged 16+ with quotas set on age, gender and work status to match the profile of the population of Sutton.\nThe percentage of respondents satisfied with how the council runs services in the borough has risen two percentage points in the past two years to 78 per cent. The satisfaction rate for the local area as a place to live has been maintained at 90 per cent compared to 2013.\nThis is despite the council having to save £74m from its annual budget between 2011 and 2019 due to unprecedented Government cuts to its annual budget.\nSo far the council has saved £43m from its annual budget, with the majority of the saving (£32m) being made without frontline services being affected. However the remaining £31m will result in services being changed, reduced and in some cases stopped which is likely to have an effect on future surveys.\nThe council launched the Sutton’s Future campaign in July 2013 to involve residents in making the savings. So far there have been more than 10,000 responses.\nThe campaign looks to have had an effect with a rise in:\n· the percentage of people saying they feel informed about how council tax is spent (48 per cent in 2013 to 65 per cent in 2015)\n· the percentage of people feel informed about Council services and benefits (49 per cent in 2013 to 64 per cent in 2015)\n· the percentage of people that they feel they can influence council-run services (44 per cent in 2013 to 51 per cent in 2015)\nOther survey results included:\n· Most residents (98 per cent) feel safe walking alone during the day in their neighbourhood. After dark, three-quarters (75 per cent) feel sale, compared with 71 per cent in 2013. The level of worry for burglary and antisocial behaviour has continued to decrease since 2011 (48 per cent and 41 per cent respectively to 37 per cent and 35 per cent in 2015).\n· More than half of residents want to know what the Council is doing but do not wish to be involved beyond that, with only 13 per cent wanting to be more involved or have a say in what the council is doing. Of those who want to be more involved or have a say, just over a third (34 per cent) would be willing to complete a questionnaire, 25 per cent to submit their views through an online channel and 28 per cent to attend a public meeting arranged by Sutton Council.\n· The satisfaction level with Sutton Council has risen consistently since 2009, when just under three-quarters (72 per cent) of residents thought the council was doing a good job. Just over six in 10 (61 per cent) agree that the council provides value for money, up from 54 per cent in 2013.\n· Residents on the whole appear to be reasonably satisfied with Council services. Since 2013, resident satisfaction has increased for services such as borough theatres, the arts and events, historic places and museums, playgrounds, sport and swimming facilities, and pavement and road maintenance.\n· However, resident satisfaction has decreased in recycling, down from 85 per cent in 2013 to 77 per cent in 2015, street cleaning from 76 per cent in 2013 to 69 per cent in 2015, refuse collection from 88 per cent in 2013 to 82 per cent in 2015, and parks and open spaces, from 87 per cent in 2013 to 82 per cent in 2015.\n· But resident satisfaction remained the same in 2013 and 2015 in parking (46 per cent), libraries (73 per cent) and street lighting (81 per cent).",

Trish was first elected in 2014 and was re-elected in 2018 and 2022. Louise was elected in 2022. Richard served as Mayor of Sutton for 2016-17 and Trish was our Mayor for a record three yearly terms, to May 2023. Louise is our Deputy Mayor for a second successive year, through to May 2025.\nLouise, Richard and Trish at City Hall presenting the petition opposing ULEZ signed by over 10 000 Sutton residents\nCONTINUE DOWN THE PAGE TO OUR CURRENT NEWS STORIES\nOR CLICK ON THE LINKS BELOW TO GO TO OUR SPECIFIC PAGES\nThe statue “The Messenger” by David Wynne, in The Quadrant, is close to the boundary between our Ward and Sutton Central Ward\nOn 10 April there was a remarkable victory for the Liberal Democrat candidate, Richard Choi, in a by-election to elect a Councillor for Sutton Central Ward on Sutton Council. Sutton Central Ward is immediately north of our Ward, Sutton South.\nRichard got more votes than all the other six candidates added together. The result was\nLiberal Democrats 1291\nConservatives 327\nReform 282\nLabour 216\nThree other candidates (the Greens, an independent and the Christian People’s Alliance) each got less than 100 votes.\nThe Liberal Democrat share of the vote increased by 17.4%, the Conservatives fell by 10% and Labour – who finished second in this seat in 2022 – by 17.4%.\nOn 3 March the Council discussed the budget proposals for the coming year. Legally, the Council is required to set a balanced budget. With so many Councils going bust or in great financial difficulty, this was always going to be a difficult task. The problems are due to a legacy of Government cuts but also a big spike in demand for services. While people think of the Council as the body that mends the potholes, empties the bins and fixes the street lights, 70% of spending is on adult social care and children’s services (particularly for those children with special educational needs), plus the cost of finding accommodation for the homeless. There has been an increase in demand in the past year, particularly in the number of adults whose social care has to be paid for by the Council, the number of children with special educational needs and in the number of homeless families.\nRichard spoke in the debate, on homelessness – a subject in which he has a special interest due to the work history of his daughter, Ellie, who worked for many years for a homelessness charity and because as chair of Planning Committee he has a role in increasing the supply of affordable family accommodation.\nHere is Richard’s speech:\n“I would like to direct the attention of Council to paragraph 8.11 of the supplemental agenda which is discussing financial risks.\nIt says that the biggest driver of overspending by London boroughs is the number of people presenting as homeless and who need to be offered temporary accommodation.\nThe paper tells us Sutton had 1 084 households homeless and in temporary accommodation in October last year. It is a higher figure tonight. It is a frightening figure. Tonight we are discussing homelessness as a financial risk to the Council, but we all recognise that the fundamental reason for our concern is that behind so many of these cases are stories of tragedy, of families losing their homes and often winding up in bed and breakfast accommodation remote from their workplace and remote from the schools their children attend.\nThere is a housing crisis and we need more homes. Residents comment on the number of new flats being built in the centre of Sutton but we need this accommodation.\nThe aspiration of the Government to build more homes is right – but it has to be tempered by a concern about quality and about dealing with the consequences.\nSutton is very built up. It is not always easy to see where the new homes will come from, particularly when we are all rightly sensitive to the concerns of residents about inappropriate development and the pressures intensification can bring.\nIt is worthwhile re-stating the principles in our local plan for Sutton.\nWe need more housing, but it must be of good quality – good enough for Sutton, which means of high quality.\nWe aim to reduce development pressures on what I call the “suburban heartland” of the borough by concentrating development in the areas where development is appropriate.\nIn particular there is a zone of potential intensification close to the town centre where public transport connections are good. This may mean some tall buildings. It may mean car free or car light development as you can provide much more accommodation if you do not have to provide a parking space for every unit, and this is more acceptable in areas close to the railway station and the town centre where public transport connections are good.\nWe have a local plan, currently under review, which sets out how we meet the requirements for infrastructure to support an increase in population, which is an important concern of residents.\nI am always keen to point out that our local plan is not like the local plan you might find in, for example, North Korea, mandating what will be built. It is aspirational. It depends on developers bringing forward proposals. Its success depends a lot on the skills of our planning staff in negotiating with developers to secure what is good for Sutton, which may not be what makes most profit for the developer. I would like to pay tribute to the work of our planning staff and in particular the head, Andy Webber, who retires this month.\nIn the past year the planning system has had a bad press. The Government says we are going for growth, growth, growth. Quite right. But when asked what are the impediments to growth they invariably cite the planning system – which is represented as run by NIMBYS frustrating necessary development. That might well be the case in some places – not here in Sutton of course. But I think there is a counter argument that the planning system is a bastion against having fields and fields of sub-standard housing, as that is what makes money for developers. We destroy the planning system at our peril. But it is also right that we need a planning system that does not stand in the way of necessary change and renewal, but ensures high quality and appropriate development, to provide housing and to stimulate the economy.\nI think we have a good track record in Sutton in supporting high quality development and there are many examples in our borough of developments characterised by good design providing quality housing and infrastructure. That is what we need.”\nThe bench at the junction of The Ridgway and Mayfield Road\nThere are a number of locations in our Ward where there are benches to enable weary pedestrians to put up their feet. At the most recent meeting of the Council’s local committee we got agreement to re-new two benches in the Ward that have deteriorated over time. These are benches in Copse Hill and the one in the photograph, which is at the junction of The Ridgway and Mayfield Road.\nThere is a history to some of the benches in our Ward. In 1988 the South Sutton Neighbourhood Association celebrated the tenth anniversary of its foundation by funding a bench in Cavendish Road close to Ambleside Gardens. The bench was, after over twenty years of use and exposure to the elements, in a very sorry state. We took action to get the bench restored, with the plaque explaining the history of the bench moved to the new bench.\nOn the 27th of January Sutton Council met. Richard raised the issue of the reasons why a recent survey by The Times newspaper ranked Sutton as the eighth most attractive place to live in England. This finding does not surprise us. We spend a lot of time knocking on the doors of our residents to introduce ourselves as your local Councillors and we find people generally say they really like Sutton, mentioning a strong sense of community, open spaces, low crime, good schools, a green and pleasant environment, parks, street trees, being convenient for London and for the countryside. This is particularly the case with people who have moved to Sutton from elsewhere, particularly those from other London boroughs, from Hong Kong and from Ukraine. Please write to us and tell us what you like about Sutton or think we can improve.\nWe are always keen to look at ways of improving our Ward.\nLast year traffic engineers undertook a study of traffic flows in our Ward and the results of the exercise are listed in a later post on this site. The results have not led to some “standout” conclusion as to a problem that needs tackling but traffic officers are examining three main issues:\nwhether action can be taken to improve the safety and the experience of pedestrians crossing the Kings Lane bridge without closing the road to vehicles. The bridge is narrow. Installing a second bridge would be impossibly expensive. Marking a pedestrian path at one side of the road might be feasible. We would welcome the views of users of the bridge, both pedestrians and motorists\nsimilarly, whether something can be done to improve the safety and the experience of pedestrians passing under the railway bridge in Langley Park Road. Some proposals are to be consulted on\npossible improvements to the busy junction where Cedar Road crosses Langley Park Road. Residents have spoken to us of the difficulties pedestrians have in crossing Langley Park Road. Consultation with residents in adjacent streets is underway on proposals to install two new traffic islands in Langley Park Road. These will form a safe area in the middle of the road so the road can be crossed by pedestrians in two phases.\nYour views on these issues, and views on any other traffic and parking issues you would like us to look at would be welcomed.\nThe police met residents of Sutton South Ward again on the evening of 15 January 2025, at Devonshire Avenue school. There are open, public meetings held quarterly at which the police discuss the policing of the Ward with local residents. We were addressed by our Ward Constable, Constable Robyn Skivens, who went through the crime statistics for the Ward. Sutton has a lower crime rate than most outer London boroughs and our Ward has one of the lowest crime rates in Sutton. However, crime always has a significant impact on the victim and public concern remains high. The draft minutes of the meeting are as below.\nSUTTON SOUTH COMMUNITY / POLICE MEETING. 15 JANUARY 2025 Attended by PC Robyn Skivens and PCSO Helen Maguire for the police. A report was given on main crime trends from 1 September to the date of the meeting. DRUG OFFENCES There had been 18 drug offences, mainly possession of drugs, mainly cannabis. While this was higher than normal the increase was partly attributable to a special police operation at Sutton train station. Four of these crimes were the interception by the Border Force of drug shipments. Where such a shipment is to premises in our Ward it will count in our statistics. BURGLARY There had been 21 burglaries or attempted burglaries. This included residential burglaries, burglaries of garages and sheds, and some burglaries of businesses. It was noted that there was usually a seasonal increase in burglary at this time of year as it was darker earlier. There had been eight residential burglaries. However, some that had been reported in sheltered accommodation in the Ward were later disproved and attributed to dementia. A disturbing case was that of a landlord who was able to let himself into a flat and commit theft. Two burglaries of garages had involved theft of bicycles. Mention was made of a shop in Brighton Road where the window was smashed and the wooden panel that was then put in place to secure the premises was pulled away to facilitate burglary. Mention was made of the theft of tools from a construction site in the Ward. Some burglaries had involved the theft of keys, which were then used to commit further offences (theft of a car key leading to theft of a car). The police stressed the need to make sure keys were kept out of sight – if the keys can be seen from your letterbox you are inviting crime.\nVEHICLE CRIME\nThere had been 14 instances of vehicle crime (theft of vehicles, damage to vehicles, theft from vehicles). The police stressed the need to avoid leaving anything of value on display in your car, or in the car at all. An unusual crime had been the theft of an excavator and a dumper from the road works in Brighton Road. THEFT There had been 23 crimes in a category the police described as “theft and kindred (to theft)” events. This included shoplifting, parcel theft, theft of pedal cycles and mobile phones. Examples mentioned included theft of scrap metal, theft of a wheelie bin and theft of a wedding ring by distraction techniques. MAJOR CRIMES There had been nine major, violent crimes in the Ward. This included several robberies at the train station, a large group altercation outside a restaurant, a fight between two drug users, and a concerning incident of a woman who was followed from the station and robbed. There were also two incidents of arson, of a bin and of a Ford transit. A ULEZ camera was deliberately damaged. There was an incident where a drug user was searched and a knife, and bladed articles, were found to be in his possession. There was a disturbing incident of an anti-semitic symbol being daubed on a wall outside the synagogue in Cedar Road. There had been a succession of incidents related to a woman living in Cedar Road who had engaged in anti- social activities that had attracted a community of drug users to her premises. This was now the subject of police reports to the DPS that were expected to lead to her being charged with serious offences. SPEEDING The police had been conducting a programme of visits to local care homes and sheltered housing to talk about scams. Residents had raised with them concerns about speeding in Cavendish Road, which had led to police action in that road. There was a discussion of speeding in local roads including Chalgrove Road, Langley Park Road, The Ridgway and Cavendish Road. The police had been carrying out speed checks in Chalgrove Road and Cavendish Road. The action in Cavendish Road had led to twelve drivers receiving warnings. The police would consider further action against speeding in local roads, subject to resources.\nOTHER MATTERS DISCUSSED Staffing levels: There should be in theory be a third officer on the Ward to support Robyn and Helen, but they were coping. The number of “extractions” when they were called away to join police exercises elsewhere in London, or at the Croydon custody suite, remained an issue of concern but was now running close to 35% of their time rather than the 50% it had once been. Mention was made of local concern about a story that a body had been discovered at a house in Egmont Road. The police assured the meeting that there was no wider implication of this incident. The next meeting was tentatively scheduled for Wednesday 14 May at Devonshire Avenue school (7pm) subject to the police checking their work rota. The meeting thanked Robyn for coming back from leave to attend the meeting and thanked the officers for their work for the community in dealing with crime in the Ward. The meeting thanked Fiona Ostler for letting us meet at the school. The date of the next meeting was provisionally set as Wednesday 14 May, at Devonshire Avenue primary school and thought continues to be given to what could be done to better publicise the meeting and get a better attendance.\nConstable Skivens, Louise, Trish and Richard with other Ward police officers at the Sutton South Hello Christmas party\nThe Phoenix Concert Band – which is based in our Ward and for which Richard plays trumpet – were busy over the Christmas period raising money for the Mayor of Sutton’s charity appeal. The band practices every Friday in the church at Christchurch in Christchurch Park. A concert in the church, staged by the band in December, drew an audience of over a hundred and raised £790 for the charity appeal. The band also played Christmas carols at an event in the Straw cafe in Manor Park in December, which raised £360. On the last Saturday before Christmas the band joined a wider group of musicians to play Christmas carols in the atrium of the St Nicholas shopping centre in Sutton (see photo) which raised £180, so £1330 in all. We were grateful to the Mayor, Councillor Colin Stears, who attended all these events. In addition the band played a concert at the Friends’ Meeting House in Cedar Road on the second Saturday in December, to entertain an enthusiastic audience before the “Second Saturday Tea” which the Quakers provide every month on the second Saturday. The Mayor of Sutton’s charities are Home-Start, Sutton, and Sutton, Kingston and Epsom – Parkinson’s UK. Our contribution to the appeal was dwarfed by the £10 000 prize for second place in the boroughs’ competition won by the Sutton float in the London New Year’s Day parade.\nWe pride ourselves on the fact that we have a network of dedicated volunteers who deliver our “FOCUS” magazine throughout the Ward. If you have the odd half hour a few times a year to support us in this way please contact us. We recently prepared an end of year newsletter to update our volunteer deliverers on our activities. We thought we would share it with those who look at our website.\n“The last year has been our most successful year in Sutton South Ward. With the election of Luke as our Member of Parliament in July we have, for the first time, three Liberal Democrat Councillors representing our Ward and a Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament representing us at Westminster. We held a successful Ward meeting on 28 November where we heard from Luke on the incredibly busy life he now has as our Member of Parliament. He has been meeting all the important community groups in Sutton and Cheam, and has made speeches in Parliament on a variety of issues – ranging from the importance of support for carers to the future of Taiwan. In his maiden speech he spoke about what a pleasant place Sutton is to live, work and raise a family, a great change from the previous MP who spent all his time running Sutton down. He is enthusiastic about his role as spokesperson for London. As Ward Councillors, we have a lot of local casework that we deal with and are doing more than our fair bit as Chairs of Council committees – Trish chairing the Audit and Governance Committee, Richard the Planning Committee and Louise combining being chair of the Licensing Committee with her role as Deputy Mayor. This is her second year as Deputy Mayor following the three years during which Trish was Mayor.\nLike every local authority, Sutton Council is pre-occupied by financial issues and struggling with some difficult decisions to balance the books. The decision to close the Registrar’s office (The Russetings) in Worcester Road was one we regretted, driven by a need to consolidate services in fewer buildings, but we believe planning controls are sufficient to protect the appearance of this attractive, locally listed, building in the street scene.\nWe have secured funding for improvements to the WArd, including new information signs at the only open space in our Ward – the Devonshire Avenue Nature Area (DANA). Maintenance of the nature area involves a balance of ensuring it is a peaceful place for people to visit while preserving the biodiversity of the site. There is now a Friends of DANA group – let us know if you would like to join it. We are already looking forward to our next electoral challenge, to retain control of the Council in 2026. We need to keep up the work of talking to our residents, delivering our literature and doorknocking. Let us know if you are interested in being one of our candidates. We welcome talking or corresponding with you and with all our residents. We hope to have further Ward meetings next year. We are really grateful for the help we get.”\nSutton South Councillors were concerned to learn about changes proposed to the organisation of the Police Cadets, who meet at a school in our ward. Currently there are over 120 cadets. However, the decision has been made to close junior cadets and cut the remaining senior cadets to just 46. Their future programme is also being severely curtailed. This will have a major impact on the youth of this borough who will no longer have the opportunity to participate in activities such as camps, parades and Duke of Edinburgh awards.\nCouncillor Louise Phelan, whose son has been a Cadet, commented “I’ve seen first-hand the benefits of being part of police cadets. They learn valuable life skills, and gain self confidence. They also support the local community and get to take part in things they wouldn’t otherwise have had the opportunity to do. For many this is a stepping stone into a career within the police force, for others the Cadets help to keep them on the right path and make better life decisions. I am incredibly concerned others will now not get these opportunities.”",

We spend a lot of time knocking on the doors of our residents to introduce ourselves as your local Councillors and we find people generally say they really like Sutton, mentioning a strong sense of community, open spaces, low crime, good schools, a green and pleasant environment, parks, street trees, being convenient for London and for the countryside. This is particularly the case with people who have moved to Sutton from elsewhere, particularly those from other London boroughs, from Hong Kong and from Ukraine. Please write to us and tell us what you like about Sutton or think we can improve.\nIS THE “A AND E” AT St HELIER STILL UNDER THREAT ? SADLY, YES\nThe following statement was issued at the start of January by Six South West London Clinical Commissioning Groups – Croydon, Kingston, Merton, Richmond, Sutton and Wandsworth.. They are the NHS decision makers for South West London:\n“The six south west London CCGs are actively discussing the next steps for local health services following the withdrawal of Surrey Downs CCG from the BSBV programme. As we have made clear in the past, the BSBV business case is now invalid and the options put forward through the programme are no longer on the table for consultation. It follows that all six CCGs are in the process of dissolving the committees to which they had delegated decision-making on BSBV.\n“However, the challenges outlined in the BSBV case for change remain. If we do not address these challenges, we know that local services will decline in quality and that we will not be able to meet the required quality and safety standards. We are discussing with each other and with our boards how we address these challenges and we hope to make a further announcement in February.”\nThe key phrase is “The challenges outlined in the BSBV case for change remain”. They are right in saying this. Too many people do go to A&E, who should instead be going to a pharmacist or their local GP. The reason they do is often because they can not get an appointment with their GP and they do not realise that visiting a pharmacist is even an option!\nWe are concerned that even though the BSBV business case is now invalid, the original solution proposed by the six CCGs of closing St Helier A&E and closing St Helier’s Maternity Ward still remain as favoured options, by the CCGs. We have to wait to see what they say.\nAn indication was given on 18 February when GPs and healthcare professionals from across South West London announced that the BSBV review that recommended the closure of key healthcare services at St Helier hospital has been scrapped.\nA new strategy on how to deliver health services in our area will now be developed by local Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) so that the best possible care can be delivered in the future.\nWe welcome that, in contrast with the failed BSBV review, healthcare services will be viewed in a holistic way and that the CCGs will be working closely with all health providers and local authorities to deliver high quality care services.\nWhile t is good news that the BSBV review has been scrapped we still need to continue demonstrating our support for St Helier and make sure that essential health services remain accessible.\nWe want to see Sutton CCG working closely with St Helier Hospital, Sutton Council (Adult Social Services and Childrens Social Services) and the Royal Marsden (Community Health Visitors) to resolve the issues raised by the original BSBV plan, and not promoting the closure of the A and E Department at St Helier.\nSTAGGERING WORKLOAD INCREASE CHALLENGES CASE FOR CLOSURE\nA staggering increase in the workload of the St. Helier hospital Accident and Emergency Department, during the hot weather, has again challenged the case for closure of this important facility.\nThe hot weather has led to the busiest July in six years at St Helier and Epsom’s Accident and Emergency departments.\nThe threatened A&E departments saw an increase of 19 per cent – which is around 1,420 extra patients between July 1 and 22.\nOverall 8,917 patients were seen during that period compared to 7,496 in 2008.\nAn average of 405 patients came in to A&E each day and on July 15 a staggering 468 patients attended A&E.\nOur photo above shows Heather and Richard at St. Helier hospital protesting against the closure of the A & E and maternity departments.\nSt. HELIER BATTLE MOVES TO NEW LEVEL\nOn 9 May local GPs and other clinicians met to discuss the future of St Helier Hospital and the proposals put forward by the Better Service Better Value (BSBV) review. Very disappointingly, the Sutton Clinical Commissioning Group has agreed to consult on the three proposals recommended by the BSBV review.\nThis is despite the clear opposition to these proposals that local campaigners and presented to the meeting.\nThe decision means that St Helier is at risk of becoming a “local hospital”, losing its A&E and maternity units and Epsom is also potentially losing its frontline services, becoming a centre for elective care.\nThe second option, but less preferred by BSBV, is Epsom becoming the local hospital with St Helier becoming the centre for elective care. The third option is St Helier continuing as an acute hospital with Epsom becoming the centre for elective care and Croydon University Hospital becoming the most downgraded.\nBut this is not a done deal.\nThese recommendations still need to be approved by the other Clinical Commissioning Groups in South West London before they will be subject to a public consultation.\nWe will continue to fight tooth and nail for the future of our local hospital, working with other local campaigners to plan how we can make sure the voice of the local community is heard.\nWe will be taking our campaign to the next level to ensure that NHS bosses can be in no doubt – we want to Save Our St Helier!\nBATTLE TO SAVE St HELIER CONTINUES\nThe BBC London news has reported tonight that, despite our efforts to date and the many flaws and criticisms of their proposals, the local NHS Better Services, Better Value (BSBV) team has decided to press ahead with recommending the closure of both St Helier and Epsom’s A&E and maternity units.\nThis is an appalling decision that flies in the face of the facts. It is not the end of the matter. It is still not too late to stop these ill-conceived plans.\nNext Wednesday (9th May) Sutton’s Clinicial Commissioning Group (CCG) will meet to consider whether it wants to consult on BSBVs proposals. The meeting will start at 1pm at St Bedes Conference Centre, St Raphael’s Hospice, London Road, North Cheam. This is not a public meeting, though it is a meeting held in public. There will be a large number of residents attending the meeting to make a silent protest against BSBVs plans and send a powerful message to the GPs and other clinicians who sit on the CCG board.\nWe are, with local MPs Paul Burstow and Tom Brake, urging as many other people as possible to write to their local GP to support St Helier.\nDespite St Helier being the best performing hospital in SW London, today’s quality has been discounted by BSBV in favour of a hope that the quality of the rest will improve in the future. You can compare the performance of our local hospitals by following this link: www.epsom-sthelier.nhs.uk/compare.\nBSBV assumes that as many as six out of ten people who use A&E do not need to be there. Even if that were true, and it is not, there are no credible costed plans to deliver the expansion in community health and GP services necessary to reverse the rising demand for A&E.\nBSBV claim that their proposals are necessary to improve patient safety. They want to have more consultants on hand, which is a good idea. But rather than taking the steps necessary to recruit them, they want to embark on a £350 million building programme to expand the remaining hospitals. They do not have any guarantees that this money will be available from the Treasury and no idea what they will do if it is not provided.\nRather than looking for the simplest, lowest cost way of delivering improved patient safety they are set on a disruptive, highly complex and risky enterprise.\nPlease write to your GP and urge them to lobby the CCG to drop the plans and opt for a less expensive and less risky alternative. Ask them to join with you and other residents in supporting our local A&E and maternity units.\nMAJOR STEP FORWARD AS LIBERAL DEMOCRATS CONTINUE BATTLE TO SAVE St. HELIER\nLocal campaigners have won a victory in the ongoing battle to save St Helier Hospital.\nLiberal Democrat campaigners are celebrating the announcement that the immediate threat to St Helier Hospital’s Accident and Emergency, maternity and children’s wards has passed – although the future remains very uncertain.\nThe Better Services Better Value (BSBV) review, which in May recommended the cuts to these hospital services, has now recommended delaying going out to consultation on the plans saying, ‘This is because NHS Surrey wish to more fully understand the impact of BSBV on their residents who use NHS services in south west London, and implications for the NHS in Surrey, before public consultation begins.\n‘This means that the BSBV programme and NHS Surrey now need more time to carry out further detailed analysis of the impact of the proposals.’\nIn May, BSBV recommended that St George’s, Croydon and Kingston hospitals remain as they are while St Helier should lose these crucial services, and instead become a centre for planned surgery across south west London.\nThe Liberal Democrat campaign to save St Helier immediately swung into action and months of effort reached a climax on 8 September when a Fun Day outside the hospital attracted protesters from across the area, who presented petitions carrying thousands of names to health service representatives.\nThe proposals were due to go out to a three-month consultation period at the beginning of October and we were preparing to continue the fight.\nHeather Honour is one of two Sutton Councillors sitting on the pan-South West London committee investigating the proposals.\nShe said: “From the start we have made it clear that this was a deeply flawed process. What a pity that so much taxpayers’ money has been wasted by the BSBV team before they came to their senses.”\nCouncillor Mary Burstow, Chair of Sutton’s Scrutiny Committee, said: “Of course this is a reason to celebrate, but now we must work to secure the future of St Helier Hospital for generations of Sutton residents to come.\n“This is now a real opportunity for residents, politicians and medical staff to work out exactly how we want to see healthcare delivered in years to come.\n“And it is crucial that that discussion covers the entire capital. London’s health services need to be looked at as a whole and decisions need to be reached that meet the needs of all Londoners.”\nHowever, the uncertainty remains for hospital staff and patients, who are still unclear about what the future holds.\nNHS CROYDON MESS RAISES NEW CONCERNS ON St HELIER\nWhere’s the money gone?\nHeather is playing a major role on a newly-created committee probing the massive hole in NHS Croydon’s finances. She is determined to find out what mistakes were made, who was at fault and what impact it will have on future healthcare in south west London.\nThe South West London Joint Health Overview and Scrutiny Committee on NHS Croydon finances met for the first time on 6 September and set itself the task of answering three crucial questions.\nFirst, how was it that on 8 June 2011 the year’s accounts were signed off with a £5.54million surplus, yet when the same books were re-examined a year later they revealed a £22.7million overspend?\nSecond, why were officers – charged with managing a huge and vital job – not properly monitored, and were they given the right tools to do the job?\nAnd, third, why in July 2012 did the South West London Cluster Board decide to try to cover up the huge deficit as a ‘prior period adjustment’?\nHeather, one of two Sutton councillors sitting on the committee, said: “It is vital that we reach the bottom of this and that we do that quickly.\n“If this is the sort of financial mismanagement we see from NHS bosses how can we be sure that the NHS BSBV team, which is after all proposing a multi-million pound plan which would close vital parts of St Helier Hospital, be able to run such a huge scheme successfully? Their track record is simply dreadful.”\nSome observers believe the problems started in April 2010 when NHS Croydon was given the added responsibility of hosting London Specialised Commissioning Group. It is thought that running the £800million project may have stretched the resources of officers beyond their ability to cope.\nThe committee, which is comprised of councillors from Sutton, Richmond, Croydon, Merton, Wandsworth and Kingston, meet again on 24 September. It will call a number of witnesses including Ann Radmore, Chief Executive of NHS South West London.\nMs Radmore was appointed Sector Chief Executive for South West London in 2009 and led the establishment of the SWL Cluster in early 2010.\nAnother witness will be Dr Peter Brambleby, who was Croydon’s Director of Public Health from March 2010 to February 2012. On 6 July he blew the whistle on NHS London’s decision on 28 June to try to hide the deficit as a ‘prior period adjustment’ which, despite Dr Brambleby’s revelation, the South West London Cluster tried to repeat on 26 July.\nHeather added: “Key personnel involved in the Better Service Better Value team planning the future of healthcare in south west London are involved in this Croydon mess. What confidence can we have in their plans for St Helier?”\nMORE CONCERNS ABOUT PROPOSALS FOR St. HELIER\nThe London Ambulance Service has revealed alarming journey time figures to Sutton Councillors.\n[ Heather, Paul Burstow MP and Richard demonstrating their opposition to the threatened closure of of the Accident and Emergency Department, outside St. Helier hospital ]\nAlarming figures from London Ambulance Service stunned Councillors at the special meeting, attended by Heather, of Sutton Council’s Scrutiny Committee, a meeting focusing on St Helier Hospital, on Monday June 11.\nBill Arkell, Operations Manager for Sutton and Streatham, shocked the meeting by revealing that journey times for emergency patients will more than double if St Helier’s Accident and Emergency (A&E) ward is closed.\nCurrently, the average journey time to St Helier is 8.5 minutes. Under the new proposals that will soar to 14-15 minutes to St George’s in Tooting, 16-17 minutes to Kingston and up to 20 minutes to Croydon Hospital.\nLiberal Democrat Councillor Mary Burstow, Chair of the Scrutiny Committee, said: “These are truly alarming figures. Report after report has shown that the quicker people get treatment the better the outcome. Doubling journey times can only put Sutton residents at greater risk.”\nThe well-attended meeting also heard that turnaround time – how long it takes from an ambulance arriving at a hospital to being ready to go on another call – is 15 minutes or less on average at St. Helier Hospital, again half the time of neighbouring hospitals.\nCouncillor Burstow added: “In light of these figures, it is absolutely astonishing that Better Services Better Value (BSBV) [the NHS body that recommended closure of St. Helier’s Accident and Emergency Department] didn’t bother to ask seek wider views and opinions.”\nThe BSBV panel last month recommended that St Helier Hospital’s A&E, maternity and children’s wards should be closed – leaving St George’s, Kingston and Croydon to deal with the patients.\nSt Helier would instead become a centre for planned operations.\nAge UK Sutton, which represents around 27,000 people – and Sutton Carers – which has 4,500 registered members looking after thousands of people – also told the meeting that they had also not been consulted before BSBV made its recommendations.\nIn robust exchanges between councillors and Rachel Tyndall, BSBV Senior Responsible Officer, and Mike Bailey, Acute Medical Director for BSBV, Sutton Council Leader Ruth Dombey referred to previous threats to St Helier saying: “We have been through years of uncertainty, so we are more than a little cynical.”\nCouncillor Dombey added: “Under the proposals St Helier would become the site for elective surgery for patients from Ham to New Addington.\n“Is there any guarantee they would come? What about the transport issues? Where would they park when they got here?”\nDuring the meeting it was revealed that BSBV’s recommendation supposes that between 2013 when the decision is due to be made and 2017 when it should be implemented, up to 50% of A&E patients would be persuaded to seek treatment in the community instead of going to hospital.\nClick here to sign our petition organised by local LibDems, on the website of Paul Burstow. [Click on the word “petition”]\nHELP US SAVE ST. HELIER’S MATERNITY AND A and E UNITS !\nA panel established under the NHS’s Better Services Better Value review has recommended that St Helier should become the centre for planned surgery in South West London, but losing its Accident & Emergency (A & E) and maternity units.\nThe review was initiated by the local NHS not by the Department of Health. Decisions about healthcare are taken by the local NHS organisation not Ministers. In the event that the final decision taken was challenged it could be referred to the Secretary of State for Health for a final decision.\nAs local Councillors who have used the services of St. Helier hospital, we oppose this decision. Heather has already been particularly active in opposing it as a member of the Joint Health Overview and Scrutiny Committee for south west London. On 15 May we joined our MP Paul Burstow in a demonstration against the decision at St. Helier hospital (in the photo above you can see Heather, Paul and Richard in front of the hospital).\nPaul Burstow, has raised serious concerns about the way in which the Better Services Better Value review, and the talks about a merger with St Georges, have been handled. Treated as completely separate discussions, in fact they directly impacted on each other.\nAt this point no final decisions have been taken. Whilst important, the panel’s recommendations are not binding and mark the beginning of a process which will include a public consultation, expected in early autumn.\nLocal LibDems have previously fought to save St Helier and in 2010 secured £219m to refurbish and rebuild the hospital.\nPaul Burstow comments:\n“This is a flawed conclusion from a flawed process. There is still a lot of water to flow under the bridge before final decisions are made.\nThe panel have ignored the pressure on all the A&Es and maternity units in south west London.\nA cloud has gathered over St Helier but I believe we can mount a successful challenge to the assumptions that have led the panel to this conclusion.\nWe have saved St Helier before, and we will fight to do so again.”\nClick here to sign our petition organised by local LibDems, on the website of Paul Burstow. [Click on the word “petition”]\nSAVE ST HELIERS\nHeather asked the Lead Councillor for Health and Social Care two questions about St Helier at last night’s council meeting:\nQ Sutton having now secured the funding for a new hospital, does the lead councillor see any risks from the proposed move away from the organisational structure that St Helier had with Epsom Hospital.”\nAnswer by Colin Stears, Lead Councillor Health and Social Care\nCertain services have been concentrated on the Epsom site whilst the preferred merger candidate St Georges Trust obviously has services in Tooting that it has built up over the years.\nI think it is important for our Health and Wellbeing scrutiny Committee to monitor closely any proposed service changes and work with clinical commissioning colleagues in the GP consortia to make sure that quality services are delivered as near as possible to the patient.\nIt would be unfortunate if one of the very few new hospitals to be built in England did not deliver the appropriate range of services to the local community.\nThe building of the new hospital is an ideal opportunity for service users , commissioners , council representatives and the provider to starting working together early in the process to make sure quality services for local people are delivered in a local setting.\nQ What does the lead councillor think about the ridiculously short timescale, scarcely a month, set by St Heliers Transaction Board, for potential partners to undertake all the work necessary to take part in the selection process, given this is an issue of such importance to the health and wellbeing of Sutton’s residents?\nA This does seem a very short timescale compared to other projects that I am aware of. I hope that this will be answered in the communications that we are having with the Transaction Board, but this is not satisfactory.",

This is despite the fact that there have been no significant flooding incidents in the Ward in the recent past.\nFollowing a report to the Council’s Scrutiny Committee about water management and flooding, the Environment Agency has approved funding to develop three flood alleviation schemes in Sutton, including a scheme in Sutton South Ward.\nThe funding is for schemes to reduce the likelihood of flooding in the Hackbridge (London Road) area, in Sandy Lane Cheam by the railway bridge, and in the Brighton Road/Overton Grange area in Sutton South.\nIn total we have been awarded £123,500 to produce studies that identify the specific problems in each area, propose solutions and provide specifications, including costings, for necessary works.\nThe Environment Agency has stated that it will look favourably on providing funding for construction of any works proposed by the studies, so this is an important step towards sorting these problems out.\nThe Environment Agency’s modelling has suggested that there is an area of possible flood risk in South Sutton Ward, around Overton Grange school and the surrounding area. However, we have no known incidents of flooding in that specific area. Residents have advised us that some years ago there was a minor flooding incident at the foot of Copse Hill (pictured above), but changes to the drainage system at the foot of the hill (following discussions Richard held with relevant Council officers) is believed to have dealt with this issue. There has also been a brief flooding incident under the Grange Vale bridge when leaf fall blocked the drains, before Richard himself removed the obstruction.\nThrough discussion with the Environment Agency’s experts the Council has come to the conclusion that the surface water sewers in Brighton Road and adjoining streets, and the railway line, are probably affecting surface water flow, with the result that any actual flooding would be more likely to occur in Brighton Road and in the part of Cedar Road between the Brighton Road and Langley Park Road, this being the area that the sewers divert the water towards.\nThe proposal is to develop the scheme to protect these areas and to model the impact of proposed new arrangements. This should help us understand where the water is actually flowing now and the benefits any new flood infrastructure will bring.\nQualified consultants recommended by the Agency are about to start work on undertaking the investigations and design work.",

We are finalising arrangements to instal more of these signs, in Grange Road and in Cedar Road.\nLocations have been agreed for the new speeding signs the Council will instal in Cedar Road. They will be slightly different from the ones in Farm Road, pictured, One sign in each direction, they will warn motorists of their speed as they approach the Langley Park Road junction. A study in 2012 found cars regularly speed in Cedar Road despite the humps and 20 mph speed limit. But residents were unhappy with a proposal for a width restriction. A re-arrangement of the parking places and the zebra crossing at the Brighton Road end have been of some help in slowing the traffic. Last year Richard took part in a police “Speedwatch” operation to record the speed of speeding vehicles in the road and was surprised at the speed some vehicles reached.",

This is in line with recent surveys that concluded that Sutton is the best place in London to bring up children, taking account of factors such as our good schools, good transport links and low crime rate\n* the issues that most concern residents in Sutton are parking, dog fouling and speeding traffic, these scoring above issues such as litter, vandalism and graffiti. There is sharply increasing concern about dog fouling, which reflects our experience in terms of issues residents raise with us as Councillors. Parking is also an issue of concern though these concerns take different forms – in roads like Eastleigh Close and Bonchurch Close it concerns difficulty in finding a parking space nearby for one’s own car, in some other roads it is a concern about commuter parking in the road. In Sutton South Ward, there is definately a concern about litter, but vandalism and graffiti are less of a problem locally\n* almost three in four (73%) are satisfied with the services of Sutton Council, higher than the national figure. There appears to be a strongly positive attitude to services such as parks and open spaces, street lighting, street cleaning, refuse collection and playgrounds, less strongly positive (though still positive) attitudes to pavement and road maintenance, and to parking services\n* a concern emerges from the survey about how well Sutton Council keeps people informed\n* although Sutton is a low crime area compared to other parts of London and 96% of residents feel safe walking outside in their neighbourhood alone during the day, this proportion drops to 62% after dark, and residents are increasingly concerned about anti-social behaviour and burglary or theft\n* a quarter of Sutton’s residents volunteer regularly and 81% think Sutton is an area where people from different backgrounds get on well together.\nIt should be noted is that, overall, people feel less well-off than when the survey was last undertaken two years ago, with 45% saying their personal financial circumstances have got worse in the last year, as the recession has bitten.\nWe are interested in the views of local people on these issues and would welcome it if readers of this article want to give us their opinion.\nMatters that clearly require attention include:\n– there is a finding that people are less satisfied than one might expect with the information received from the Council. How can we improve on this ?\n– dog fouling has got worse. The problem is a small minority of dog owners. Most are very responsible. Is there any solution ?\nA further study of our local area (covering three Wards – Sutton South, Belmont and Cheam) will be available shortly. The sample size is too small to give results just for Sutton South Ward.",

The national average was 58.3 per cent, while 62.2 per cent of outer London pupils achieved the benchmark this summer.\nAn impressive 91.2 per cent of Sutton’s 16-year-olds earned five or more A*-C grades in any subject, compared to an outer London average of 82.7 per cent.\nThis is excellent news and confirms something we have known for a long time; that Sutton has some of the very best schools in the country. To top the table, ahead of every other local authority area in England, is a real achievement, and one that teachers, parents and students will be delighted about. All those pupils who took GCSE exams this summer should be very proud of themselves.\nThe local authority looks forward to working in partnership with those schools which have since become academies, to ensure these results continue.\nIn August it was revealed that Sutton pupils had achieved their best ever SATs results, placing the borough third in the national league table. The tests in reading, writing and mathematics, are taken by 11-year-olds at the end of their primary education.\nIt also follows Sutton being announced as the best place in London to bring up a family.

  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_category_news_page_3/content_79.html": "On 21 September Richard attended a “Community Walkabout” organised by Sutton Housing Partnership (SHP) at Kingslee Court and Thorn Court in Worcester Road. These events are organised to provide an opportunity for residents to raise issues of concern with SHP staff. SHP’s Chief Executive and senior SHP staff attended. A high proportion of the residents are leaseholders and many took part. The residents said they appreciated the recent re-location of the refuse bins and the re-painting of the entrance gate. Some “snagging” arising from the recent renovation work on the buildings was noted and various other concerns of the residents explored.\nOn 19 October all three Councillors attended similar “Community Walkabouts” at Sutton Court and at Beauclere House, in Brighton Road. These were again well attended by residents. A wide variety of issues were raised including the use of the garages, parking, dealing with anti-social behaviour and lighting. These exercises were thought to have been very useful by those who took part. The photo shows the group at Kingslee Court.\nThe owner of Chelsea Court, 54 Mulgrave Road has had planning permission to extend the building – in effect adding two extra floors to the block of flats – refused by Sutton Council. This was the latest in a series of applications in our Ward where owners of blocks of flats have sought to extend the building upwards.\nAs local Councillors, we were concerned about these proposals. While there is a need for more accommodation, the changes to the building would in our view make it look incongruous, not good enough for Sutton. The block is an attractive architect-designed building (see photo), one of the more attractive blocks in Mulgrave Road, and the proposed changes would destroy the symmetry of the building. The Planning Department at Sutton Council agreed with our objections. The changes would also have involved building work that would greatly disturb the current residents of the block.\nThe owners used a mechanism called “prior approval” when submitting their planning application. This mechanism, in our view, was introduced by the Government to undermine the planning system. As a result, we could take the application to the Council’s Planning Committee, which Richard chairs, for decision by Councillors. We may still not be able to stop these changes taking place given the powers of the remote Planning Inspectorate based in Bristol to over-ride local decisions.\nWe always seek to ensure in such cases that a number of conditions are stipulated in any planning permission, if one is ever granted, to try to protect the peace and quiet of the building during construction work. These include that access to the roof should be via an external hoist with all materials for work on the roof transported to the roof by an external hoist and not brought up via the well of the building. The interior of the building should not be a storage area or building site. There should be a construction management plan to minimize disruption to existing residents and ensure there are controls on dust and noise, and on hours of work. The contractors should join the Considerate Contractors’ Scheme. There should be a liaison officer that residents can contact if they observe poor behaviour. If scaffolding is erected outside residents’ windows it should only be erected when needed and removed as soon as it is not needed.\nWe have successfully opposed this development but wait to see if the developer will appeal to the Planning Inspectorate against the decision of the Council.\nLouise, Richard and Trish travelled to City Hall, the HQ of London Mayor Sadiq Khan, on 30 June to join other Sutton Liberal Democrat Councillors in presenting a petition to the Mayor. The petition, signed by over 10 000 Sutton residents, expressed our opposition to the extension of the ULEZ zone to outer London boroughs. Our views on why we opposed the extension of ULEZ can be found in posts further down this site.\nDespite our opposition, ULEZ has now been extended by the London Mayor to outer London.\nWe are again involved in arguments over proposals to add extra storeys the top of Northumberland House.\nNorthumberland House is the tower block at the corner of Brighton Road and Wellesley Road, about 200 yards along Brighton Road if you turn left when coming out of Sutton station.\nCriterion Capital, the owners of Northumberland House, are again seeking planning permission to add two storeys to the top of the building. The owners are again seeking to extend the building, creating a further 29 flats by adding two extra storeys on the top of the ten storey part of the building and an extra storey on the lower part, with some additional flats in the “undercroft” above the parking area. Some of the current parking spaces would be lost.\nAn earlier similar application was not supported by Sutton Council on the basis of design of the proposed tower extension and issues about the alignment of the windows. Planning law allows developers to seek to over-ride the decisions of local Councillors by appealing to the remote Bristol-based Planning Inspectorate, whose decision is final. The developers went to appeal, to the Planning Inspectorate, and on 5 October Richard and Louise attended and spoke on behalf of residents at a hearing organised by the Planning Inspectorate.\nWe had noted that there would be some positives, such as the creation of a community amenity and play space on the tarmaced area at ground floor level. However, while there is a shortage of accommodation in London and more housing is needed, we were concerned that the building work had the potential to be extremely disruptive to the lives of current residents. And an extra two storeys on the top of the building looks incongruous and out of keeping with the design of the rest of the building. Richard told the Inspector the design “looked like a couple of portacabins had been dumped on the top of the building.” At the hearing we told the Planning Inspector that residents of Northumberland House are concerned about the likely disruption involved in this proposed work, and have long standing concerns about frequent lift breakdowns in the building and the general standard of housekeeping, particularly in the bin area. We pressed the Inspector to impose conditions, if he were to agree to the scheme, to protect the interests of residents, and include these conditions in any planning permission they eventually obtained. We asked that access to the roof areas would be only by external hoists, and that the peace and quiet of the interior of the building would not be disturbed or the interior turned into a storage area, or building site. We sought controls on scaffolding to ensure any scaffolding that is required is removed as soon as the requirement has passed. We insisted there must be a construction management plan to control hours of work and control noise and dust nuisance. We asked that the contractor joins the “Considerate Contractors Scheme”, which provides a route for residents to raise concerns if they observe poor behaviour. We were pleased that the developers indicated they would accept all these conditions.\nThe Inspector supported our views and commented that the proposed building looks “incongruous” – the exact wording Richard had used at the hearing. He turned down the application and also refused the application for costs.\nThe owners have now submitted a further, similar application. Residents can see the proposals via the Council’s website (go to the section on planning and follow leads to get to comment on planning applications). It is application DM2023/00796. We are keen to learn of the views of residents on this matter, particularly those who live in Northumberland House. Do contact us at the email addresses given in the first post on this site.\nThis picture shows Louise and Trish cleaning off the graffiti we found in the area outside Northumberland House in Brighton Road. We want residents to report to us instances of graffiti, which is one of the scourges of our times, worldwide. In general, the Council has a good record in cleaning off graffiti quickly. A difficulty is when the graffiti is on private property and the owners of the property have responsibility.\nHere is an example of graffiti we got cleaned off, on the bridge at Kings Lane.\nIn support of our policies to combat global warming and reduce carbon emissions, the programme to fit electric vehicle charging points in lampposts in our Ward continues. A further consultation exercise is about to take place on the installation of two new electric vehicle charging points in Mulgrave Road, close to the junction with Worcester Road. A preliminary consultation found majority support but few residents responded.\nThere are now charging points at the following locations:\nOpposite 49 The Ridgway\nOpposite 26 Langley Park Road\nOpposite Foxley Court in Christchurch Park\nOpposite 10 Cumnor Road\nIn Cedar Gardens\nOpposite Grange Court, Grange Road\nOpposite Thomas House, Grange Road\nOpposite 13 Stanley Road\nOpposite Fairford Court, Stanley Road\nWe want to draw attention to the Sutton Citizen space survey where residents should log their suggestions for EV charge points.\nThe photo shows the first vehicle that used the first charging point in the Ward, in The Ridgway. Given the policy to ultimately phase out petrol driven vehicles, a big and continuing expansion will be needed.\nSutton Council is working with Siemens to install Ubitricity lamp column electric vehicle charging points. Ubitricity lamp column charging points are compact and fit into the door of a lamp column. The aim of lamp column charging is to give residents the ability to easily charge electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles on the street where they live, especially if they do not have off-street parking or are unable to install their own home charging point. Installing residential charging points is important because a key barrier to people switching to electric vehicles is the concern around where they will be able to charge their vehicle.\nNot all lamp columns are suitable for lamp column charging points. The lamp columns need to be “electrically suitable”, be positioned near the kerb and have enough internal space to fit the charging point. They need to be sensibly located so that a vehicle could safely park and charge next to the lamp column. The lamp columns also need to be made of metal, not concrete.\nAn “earth mat”, a small metal grid, is also installed in the footway next to the lamp column. This is to make the charging point “electrically safe” if there is a fault. There are signs to indicate that the lamp column has a charging point fitted, though this sign will not prevent non-electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles from parking next to the lamp column.\nThis is a major advance in our drive to promote electric vehicles and combat global warming.\nOn 22 May Louise was elected as Deputy Mayor of the London Borough of Sutton. Louise was elected to Sutton Council, joining Trish and Richard as Councillors for Sutton South Ward, on 5 May 2022. Louise – Louise Phelan – has lived in Sutton for over 20 years and her son Harry, who will be officially titled her “Consort” as Deputy Mayor, attends Overton Grange school in our Ward. She is an active member of many local community organisations and was a leading member of the Sutton New Town Community Festival, serving as chair of the organisation. Harry is a member of Sutton Police Cadets.\nThe Coronation weekend saw a rash of street parties throughout Sutton South Ward, though there were fewer than there had been for the Platinum Jubilee celebrations last June. Louise, Trish and Richard dropped in at some of the parties, including the street party in Prior Avenue, which was a more modest affair than their Jubilee street party last summer. Richard also dropped in at the Highfield Residents’ Association event.\nOur Mayor and the two other Ward Councillors at the Effingham Close street party last June.\nThe three Sutton South Councillors are united in opposing the extension of ULEZ to Sutton. While everyone is concerned about air quality, it will have a detrimental effect on so many of our residents, particularly those who run businesses or depend on using a car to get to work or to see family. At the Sutton Council meeting on 24 April we debated ULEZ. This is the speech Louise made.\n“So ULEZ… I don’t have a car and I don’t drive, so it won’t affect me…\nOnly, actually it will…\nYou see, as I don’t have a car I have to rely on people that do, and many of the people I know do not have ULEZ compliant vehicles…\nI rely on\nThe friend that’s taken me and my son on days out to places that we wouldn’t be able to get to by public transport,\nThe neighbour that’s taken me and my son Christmas shopping so we didn’t have to carry everything on a long bus journey,\nThe friend that’s picked me and my son up from hospital when my son was taken in for an emergency,\nThe friend who has moved furniture for me in his van.\nThe family and friends that come and visit me from outside the borough.\nThis is just a tiny snapshot of the people who I and people like me depend on who will have to change their vehicles because of the ULEZ, but these people are all going to struggle to replace those cars or vans because they are already wrestling with the after effects of COVID and the cost of living crisis. Public transport isn’t currently an alternative in Sutton, it’s too expensive, too infrequent and too patchy throughout the borough.\nDon’t get me wrong, I live on a busy cut through road and would appreciate cleaner air and all the health benefits, but the effects on the quality of life and opportunities for me and my son are just too great. This will leave so many people like me without that extra help they need and rely on, they will find it harder to work, socialise and access healthcare and become even more isolated than before.\nSo you can see, this doesn’t just affect a small amount of vehicles as the Mayor of London claims in his now withdrawn advert, the knock on effect if this is brought in its current form will actually affect a much wider community of people whose lifelines will be cut. “\nAt the Sutton Council meeting on 24 April Councillors passed a vote of thanks to Trish for her service, for the third consecutive year, as Mayor. Here is the speech Richard made moving the vote of thanks.\n“It is often the case that these votes of thanks at the end of a period of office are seen as routine. I would like to suggest to you some reasons why this particular vote of thanks is far from routine and should be a heartfelt “thank you” from all of us. First, stamina. This is Councillor Fivey’s third successive year as Mayor. I recollect from my own year as Mayor how drained I felt at the end of it. I know that activities in Councillor Fivey’s first year as Mayor were limited by the pandemic, and she was evidently ready to have another go at it when it came to the end of the year. But to go on for a third successive year is extraordinary. And my observation is that she was such a success in her first two years – so energetic, so popular, someone who brought real fizz and energy to any event she went to – that the invitations and the demands on the Mayor kept increasing, as people wanted to see her again, and again, and again. She has taken whatever workload has been thrown at her in her stride. And her sparkling and warm personality has been the key to her popularity and her success. What I have really admired in the past year, though, is her remarkable good judgement in the handling of these Council meetings. We have seen interruptions and behaviour at recent meetings that were not problems, on the same scale, that her predecessors, in my thirteen years as a Councillor, have had to deal with, and all of us would have struggled with. Trish has shown great ability, great common sense and impeccable judgement in the way she has handled these problems. Councillors, it gives me great pleasure to move this vote of thanks.”",

To make this manageable the study will be scheduled over several years, dealing with the town centre in the first year. Any changes to the town centre controlled parking zone and car parks will have an impact on the roads in our Ward so the plan starts from the centre and moves outwards. Our area will be considered the following year.\nPeople have a mix of views on parking controls in their road. As they can displace parking into nearby roads, it is not intended to introduce further parking controls in the roads in our Ward prior the study next year. But we would welcome the views of residents in preparation for this study.",

We are finalising arrangements to instal more of these signs, in Grange Road and in Cedar Road.\nLocations have been agreed for the new speeding signs the Council will instal in Cedar Road. They will be slightly different from the ones in Farm Road, pictured, One sign in each direction, they will warn motorists of their speed as they approach the Langley Park Road junction. A study in 2012 found cars regularly speed in Cedar Road despite the humps and 20 mph speed limit. But residents were unhappy with a proposal for a width restriction. A re-arrangement of the parking places and the zebra crossing at the Brighton Road end have been of some help in slowing the traffic. Last year Richard took part in a police “Speedwatch” operation to record the speed of speeding vehicles in the road and was surprised at the speed some vehicles reached.",

This led to the biggest speeding survey ever in our Ward, and to agreement on width restrictions to reduce speeding at two points in Cedar Road and two points in Cavendish Road.\nIn addition we have proposed and obtained funding for additional “20 mph” roundels to be painted on roads within the South Sutton 20mph area. This will enable the Council to put 20 mph “roundels” on the road at the east end of Cavendish Road to match those at the west end. There have always been roundels at the west end, so drivers know it is a 20mph zone they are entering. At the east end there is no roundel as the driver is already in a 20 mph zone and the law said the roundels could only be placed at the entry point to the zone. A recent change in the law means the roundels can now be displayed within the zone to re-enforce the message. We hope to have additional roundels at several points within the 20mph zone to re-enforce the message that you are in such a zone.\nWe are convinced this will help with the speeding problem in Cavendish Road, and elsewhere in the 20mph zone.",

Richard had prepared a speech but was not called to speak, as so many members of the public and Councillors wanted to speak. So here is what he would have said.\n“My own objections to ULEZ are because it does something that is rare in British public administration – it\ncreates massive winners and losers on a random basis, for some of the losers it is devastating, and these are ordinary families not corporations or organisations.\nTo illustrate, I have a resident who purely by chance has a car that is not ULEZ compliant, who has to travel each day to a workplace not easily accessible by public transport, and for whom the consequence of paying £12.50 a day to go to work is not supportable from his income. Selling his car is difficult as the bottom has fallen out of the market for non-compliant cars. It is difficult now to obtain a second\nhand complaint car, and the cost is prohibitive even if you can find one. The supply of new cars has been disrupted by the problems related to computer chips – I have a resident who has been on a waiting list for a year, waiting to buy a new van for his business. Re-distributing non- compliant cars does nothing to improve air quality and the replacement of old cars by new is proceeding at a pace determined by supply, so quite unaffected by ULEZ. ULEZ may lead to some trips in cars being undertaken by public\ntransport, though not so much in Sutton where the public transport infrastructure is less well developed.\nSo ULEZ will, randomly, reduce some families to poverty with at best a small effect on air quality.\nClearly a major factor is the deal Sadiq Khan made with the Government to offset part of the implications of the post-pandemic collapse in TfL finances through ULEZ, in return for Government subsidy to cover the rest. So let us be clear that the Tory Government is as much implicated\nin this as the Mayor of London. In this chamber, the only political party leading the fight and not implicated in causing the problem is the Liberal Democrats.”",

Of this figure 92 per cent said they were satisfied with how their query was dealt with face-to-face.\nThe data is collected and analysed by a company called GovMetric, which is used by 75 local authorities across the country.\nThe council is keen to replicate this success on its website, to save council tax payers money. Each face-to-face transaction costs the council £5.87 to process. Over the telephone the cost is £2.24, but internet transactions cost just 28p.\nFrom January to November this year, residents contacted the council by telephone 314,425 times, face-to-face 31,539 times and 625,958 times via the internet.\nDeputy Leader of Sutton Council, Councillor Ruth Dombey, said: “Now more than ever it is important that we are able to deal with residents’ enquiries as efficiently and helpfully as possible, to ensure we get the best possible value for money for our council tax payers and the best possible results.\n“I’m delighted residents are happy with the level of service they receive from their council. Our customer services team are doing a great job and it’s fantastic to have that recognised.\n“The feedback we receive allows us to listen to residents and, if anything goes wrong, rectify it quickly. For example, when the 24-hour touchtone payment system was replaced with voice recognition software, customers told us they did not like it. The council reverted back to touchtone within a couple of days.”",

Although the revised policing model promised by Borough Commander Mark Lawrence promises two Dedicated Ward Officers, supported by a PCSO, by the end of 2017, Kellie is at the moment something of a one woman band.\nWe were delighted that Frank Berry, who lives in Christchurch Park and was formerly chair of the Sutton Federation of Residents and Tenants’ Associations has agreed to chair future meetings.\nThe meeting ran through the crime statistics for the last three months. A theme in the four burglaries from houses was windows left open, and in motor vehicle crime carelessness about locking vehicles and leaving SatNavs on display inside the car. Other themes discussed at the meeting were incidents of rough sleeping in stairwells of blocks of flats.

This picture shows Sutherland House – it is hoped that the seat outside Sutherland House can be restored if the problems associated with public drinking in this area can be dealt with ]\nSutton Council has extended what is popularly called the “No Drinking” zone to our Ward.\nEven before we were elected, we were aware of the concerns of local residents and the problems of anti-social behaviour associated with a group of what are sometimes called “all day drinkers”. These people often congregated at the Brighton Road / Cedar Road intersection.\nFollowing a number of discussions that we, as Ward Councillors, had with the Council Executive member responsible for public order matters, Councillor Graham Tope, the Council has taken steps in a policy direction that we have advocated, to deal with the problem.\nAt present, the town centre in Sutton is a “Designated Public Place” – popularly called a “No Drinking” zone. An effect is that the group of people who drink on the street for much of the day congregated just outside the zone, in particular at the street corner at the end of Cedar Road where it meets the Brighton Road. This is close to Forest Dene Court, a large block of flats for elderly people, some of whom have expressed to us their concern about this group of drinkers. Now, the Council has extended the zone to cover an area of Sutton South Ward.\nThe area covered is a square bordered by Cedar Road, Langley Park Road, Egmont Road and the Brighton Road. The police were able to provide evidence of anti-social behaviour associated with drinking to justify including this area in the zone. Now the zone is extended to this area, the police will monitor the effect. If the problem is simply displaced to a different area, consideration can be given to a further extension.\nThe legal effect of the Designated Public Places Order is that if someone is drinking alcohol in public in this area the police can ask them to stop. If they do not stop, they are guilty of an offence.\nThe designation of the Sutton South zone was subject to public consultation. Statutory notices were placed in newspapers and on relevant websites on 11 January. Representations could be made during the consultation period, which ended on 7 February. A second statutory notice was published. The order came into force on 15 March 2011.\nAs your local Councillors, we are delighted with these developments, which we have pressed for, with the Council. We have had the support of the local police and the Sutton South police consultative committee (whose activities are reported elsewhere on this website, on the page on police matters). As a result of this development the police will be able to spend less time dealing with the anti-social behaviour associated with public drinking and spend more time on their two other priorities for our Ward, car crime and drug dealing.\nWhen the results of the new measures are clear, we hope it will then be possible to restore the seat outside Sutherland House, which was removed as it became associated with public order problems caused by this group of people.",

A resident suggested this was about the point where someone walking back from the station with a takeaway snack would finish it and drop rubbish.\nRe-surfacing of Hillcroome Road to deal with potholes after the hard winter of 2009/2010.\nImprovements to the layout of the Brighton Road at the junction with Ventnor Road and Devonshire Avenue, to reduce road accidents.\nImprovements made in relation to signage and road markings outside Overton Grange school due to concerns about road safety when students leave the school at the end of the day. A new, flashing “wig wag” sign (it flashes when switched on at about the time students arrive at or leave school) erected.\nThis is the “wig wag” sign.\nExpansion of Devonshire Avenue, The Avenue and Barrow Hedges primary schools will make it easier for Sutton South parents to get their children into these excellent, popular and frequently over-subscribed schools. We also succeeded in moving the polling stations from Devonshire and Barrow Hedges schools to local church halls, so the education of the children will not be disrupted for a day and related child care problems can be avoided.\nExtension of the “No Drinking Zone” into Sutton South Ward, to deal with issues of anti-social behaviour associated with a group of “all day drinkers” who tend to congregate on the corner of Cedar Road and Brighton road, the location shown in this picture.\nRepresentations made by your local Liberal Democrat Councillors to contribute to Sutton-wide response to Transport for London consultation on the future of the X26 Croydon to Heathrow service, the 80 service from Sutton station to Belmont and the 280 Tooting to Belmont service, to stress the importance to local people of these services.\nSupport for the creation of more “car club” bays in Sutton South Ward, such as this bay in Albion Road which was identified for conversion to a “car club” bay, in order to encourage better car use, reducing pollution, a “greener” Borough and policy on sustainable transport. This proposal is currently on hold but Car2go have expanded their car club service in the Ward.\nNew street trees planted, such as this one in Copse Hill. And in Copse Hill we also intervened to get Council officials to look at the potential for a flooding problem at the foot of the hill, with the cleaning out of the soakaways and other improvements.\nAction to improve the Devonshire Avenue Nature Area, involving, amongst other things, re-positioning the benches, partially removing a wall that divides up the site, possibly fencing some areas with low wooden fencing to protect the kidney vetch essential for the small blue buterfly, removing the corrugated iron sheeting found at the site and installing a small piece of play equipment for children aged 5 to 7 at the entrance, while taking action to control the habitat. The reserve is the only open space in the Ward. We have supported only limited installation of play equipment as we believe the area should continue to be a nature reserve, and our proposals are designed to ensure the habitat of the area will not be harmed. We are promoting a programme to assist the small blue butterfly.\nAction to improve the safety of pedestrians who pass under the railway bridge in Grange Vale. There is a narrow pavement and, as it is a one-way street, cars roar round the corner from the Brighton Road end and under the bridge, the driver only seeing a pedestrian on the pavement under the bridge at the last moment. This is a particular problem for parents with buggies or with small children passing under the bridge against the direction of traffic. A barrier and set of posts have been erected to slow the traffic.\nThis photo shows the improvement made.\nAction taken to discuss with BT the installation of the new generation of very large green cabinets at locations in the Ward, to ensure they are put in locations that do not cause annoyance to residents, as this box in Cedar Road does. Action to prevent the boxes being covered with unsightly advertising.\nAction to promote the sensitive re-development of Sutherland House, which is currently an eyesore, and to ensure that if it is re-developed there will be gains for the residents of the Ward through a programme of improvements funded by the developer, through the community infrastructure levy and section 106 contributions.\nAction to get the Edwardian tennis pavilion in Mayfield Road included on the Sutton Local List as a building of significant local historical importance and interest.\nCampaign launched to stop Thameslink services being terminated at Blackfriars, something that would lead to dispersion of commuters onto other services that are already packed, cut Sutton off from St. Pancras International and north London, and harm the attractiveness of Sutton to companies locating their offices away from but close to central London.\nA programe of road maintenence throughout the Ward – this picture shows line painting in Eaton Road.\nThe side entrance at Sutton station\nOur campaign continues to get the side entrance to Sutton station opened. A bid submitted by Sutton Council for funding from the Mayor’s Outer London Fund was not successful, but the campaign continues and a further bid (to TfL) has been successful. This is not the end of the story as negotiations continue on matched funding..\nWe succeeded in getting the date for the four-yearly pruning of the thousand or so street trees in Sutton South Ward brought forward to the end of 2011. We have also got commitment to an interim look at the state of the trees, outside the normal four year cycle, in 2014.",

Currently, Subsea7 are applying for planning permission to build a new international headquarters (see above) on the site.\nRichard pointed out that this development will safeguard several hundred jobs currently in Sutton that were likely to move elsewhere, and bring a further three to four hundred jobs into Sutton South Ward. These new jobs are good news for Sutton.\nThis development will create jobs, not just for engineers but a range of less skilled jobs (clerks, receptionists, cleaners, messengers, drivers etc.). This site is surrounded by areas of social housing where we meet, in our casework, people who are out of work and whose lives would be transformed by finding work. Every day we open the newspaper and see news of more redundancies nationwide – but Richard and Heather can speak of securing an extra 300 plus jobs in our Ward. The development will also give an uplift to the area, the Gateway to Sutton from the south, with office workers and the company’s clients spending money in local shops, restaurants and hotels, creating further jobs.\nBut the second message is that to deal with local concerns about parking in local streets if the car park closes, we need to persuade the users of the Brighton Road car park to use the town centre car parks, which have the capacity. The average weekday demand at peak occupancy of the car park is about 380 vehicles and 320 have season tickets. So the season ticket holders are key.\nThe first and most important element in the strategy is a financial discount to persuade people to move. The discount proposed by the Committee, as a recommendation to the Strategy and Resources Committee, says to the season ticket holders “move to Gibson Road and you will pay, for the first year, what you paid last year less 10% – unless, you already have a discount, in which case it continues. This is to compensate you for the inconvenience of moving and to provide an incentive to move to Gibson Road”.\nWe hope this will persuade people to move, to a car park which is no more than seven minutes walk away.\nThe further element of the strategy is improvements in respect of signage to the car parks (including electronic signs indicating what number spaces are available) and improvements in access, in particular enabling those leaving Gibson Road to avoid the town centre one way system.\nWe hope this proposed substantial discount will achieve the right result, so that we will be able to secure the major advantage of the new jobs while coping with the reduction in parking space. The structure of discounts will, however, be further considered by the Strategy and Resources Committee.",

Richard served as Mayor of Sutton for 2016-17 and Trish was our Mayor for a record three yearly terms, to May 2023. Louise is our Deputy Mayor for a second successive year, through to May 2025.\nLouise, Richard and Trish at City Hall presenting the petition opposing ULEZ signed by over 10 000 Sutton residents\nCONTINUE DOWN THE PAGE TO OUR CURRENT NEWS STORIES\nOR CLICK ON THE LINKS BELOW TO GO TO OUR SPECIFIC PAGES\nThe statue “The Messenger” by David Wynne, in The Quadrant, is close to the boundary between our Ward and Sutton Central Ward\nOn 10 April there was a remarkable victory for the Liberal Democrat candidate, Richard Choi, in a by-election to elect a Councillor for Sutton Central Ward on Sutton Council. Sutton Central Ward is immediately north of our Ward, Sutton South.\nRichard got more votes than all the other six candidates added together. The result was\nLiberal Democrats 1291\nConservatives 327\nReform 282\nLabour 216\nThree other candidates (the Greens, an independent and the Christian People’s Alliance) each got less than 100 votes.\nThe Liberal Democrat share of the vote increased by 17.4%, the Conservatives fell by 10% and Labour – who finished second in this seat in 2022 – by 17.4%.\nOn 3 March the Council discussed the budget proposals for the coming year. Legally, the Council is required to set a balanced budget. With so many Councils going bust or in great financial difficulty, this was always going to be a difficult task. The problems are due to a legacy of Government cuts but also a big spike in demand for services. While people think of the Council as the body that mends the potholes, empties the bins and fixes the street lights, 70% of spending is on adult social care and children’s services (particularly for those children with special educational needs), plus the cost of finding accommodation for the homeless. There has been an increase in demand in the past year, particularly in the number of adults whose social care has to be paid for by the Council, the number of children with special educational needs and in the number of homeless families.\nRichard spoke in the debate, on homelessness – a subject in which he has a special interest due to the work history of his daughter, Ellie, who worked for many years for a homelessness charity and because as chair of Planning Committee he has a role in increasing the supply of affordable family accommodation.\nHere is Richard’s speech:\n“I would like to direct the attention of Council to paragraph 8.11 of the supplemental agenda which is discussing financial risks.\nIt says that the biggest driver of overspending by London boroughs is the number of people presenting as homeless and who need to be offered temporary accommodation.\nThe paper tells us Sutton had 1 084 households homeless and in temporary accommodation in October last year. It is a higher figure tonight. It is a frightening figure. Tonight we are discussing homelessness as a financial risk to the Council, but we all recognise that the fundamental reason for our concern is that behind so many of these cases are stories of tragedy, of families losing their homes and often winding up in bed and breakfast accommodation remote from their workplace and remote from the schools their children attend.\nThere is a housing crisis and we need more homes. Residents comment on the number of new flats being built in the centre of Sutton but we need this accommodation.\nThe aspiration of the Government to build more homes is right – but it has to be tempered by a concern about quality and about dealing with the consequences.\nSutton is very built up. It is not always easy to see where the new homes will come from, particularly when we are all rightly sensitive to the concerns of residents about inappropriate development and the pressures intensification can bring.\nIt is worthwhile re-stating the principles in our local plan for Sutton.\nWe need more housing, but it must be of good quality – good enough for Sutton, which means of high quality.\nWe aim to reduce development pressures on what I call the “suburban heartland” of the borough by concentrating development in the areas where development is appropriate.\nIn particular there is a zone of potential intensification close to the town centre where public transport connections are good. This may mean some tall buildings. It may mean car free or car light development as you can provide much more accommodation if you do not have to provide a parking space for every unit, and this is more acceptable in areas close to the railway station and the town centre where public transport connections are good.\nWe have a local plan, currently under review, which sets out how we meet the requirements for infrastructure to support an increase in population, which is an important concern of residents.\nI am always keen to point out that our local plan is not like the local plan you might find in, for example, North Korea, mandating what will be built. It is aspirational. It depends on developers bringing forward proposals. Its success depends a lot on the skills of our planning staff in negotiating with developers to secure what is good for Sutton, which may not be what makes most profit for the developer. I would like to pay tribute to the work of our planning staff and in particular the head, Andy Webber, who retires this month.\nIn the past year the planning system has had a bad press. The Government says we are going for growth, growth, growth. Quite right. But when asked what are the impediments to growth they invariably cite the planning system – which is represented as run by NIMBYS frustrating necessary development. That might well be the case in some places – not here in Sutton of course. But I think there is a counter argument that the planning system is a bastion against having fields and fields of sub-standard housing, as that is what makes money for developers. We destroy the planning system at our peril. But it is also right that we need a planning system that does not stand in the way of necessary change and renewal, but ensures high quality and appropriate development, to provide housing and to stimulate the economy.\nI think we have a good track record in Sutton in supporting high quality development and there are many examples in our borough of developments characterised by good design providing quality housing and infrastructure. That is what we need.”\nThe bench at the junction of The Ridgway and Mayfield Road\nThere are a number of locations in our Ward where there are benches to enable weary pedestrians to put up their feet. At the most recent meeting of the Council’s local committee we got agreement to re-new two benches in the Ward that have deteriorated over time. These are benches in Copse Hill and the one in the photograph, which is at the junction of The Ridgway and Mayfield Road.\nThere is a history to some of the benches in our Ward. In 1988 the South Sutton Neighbourhood Association celebrated the tenth anniversary of its foundation by funding a bench in Cavendish Road close to Ambleside Gardens. The bench was, after over twenty years of use and exposure to the elements, in a very sorry state. We took action to get the bench restored, with the plaque explaining the history of the bench moved to the new bench.\nOn the 27th of January Sutton Council met. Richard raised the issue of the reasons why a recent survey by The Times newspaper ranked Sutton as the eighth most attractive place to live in England. This finding does not surprise us. We spend a lot of time knocking on the doors of our residents to introduce ourselves as your local Councillors and we find people generally say they really like Sutton, mentioning a strong sense of community, open spaces, low crime, good schools, a green and pleasant environment, parks, street trees, being convenient for London and for the countryside. This is particularly the case with people who have moved to Sutton from elsewhere, particularly those from other London boroughs, from Hong Kong and from Ukraine. Please write to us and tell us what you like about Sutton or think we can improve.\nWe are always keen to look at ways of improving our Ward.\nLast year traffic engineers undertook a study of traffic flows in our Ward and the results of the exercise are listed in a later post on this site. The results have not led to some “standout” conclusion as to a problem that needs tackling but traffic officers are examining three main issues:\nwhether action can be taken to improve the safety and the experience of pedestrians crossing the Kings Lane bridge without closing the road to vehicles. The bridge is narrow. Installing a second bridge would be impossibly expensive. Marking a pedestrian path at one side of the road might be feasible. We would welcome the views of users of the bridge, both pedestrians and motorists\nsimilarly, whether something can be done to improve the safety and the experience of pedestrians passing under the railway bridge in Langley Park Road. Some proposals are to be consulted on\npossible improvements to the busy junction where Cedar Road crosses Langley Park Road. Residents have spoken to us of the difficulties pedestrians have in crossing Langley Park Road. Consultation with residents in adjacent streets is underway on proposals to install two new traffic islands in Langley Park Road. These will form a safe area in the middle of the road so the road can be crossed by pedestrians in two phases.\nYour views on these issues, and views on any other traffic and parking issues you would like us to look at would be welcomed.\nThe police met residents of Sutton South Ward again on the evening of 15 January 2025, at Devonshire Avenue school. There are open, public meetings held quarterly at which the police discuss the policing of the Ward with local residents. We were addressed by our Ward Constable, Constable Robyn Skivens, who went through the crime statistics for the Ward. Sutton has a lower crime rate than most outer London boroughs and our Ward has one of the lowest crime rates in Sutton. However, crime always has a significant impact on the victim and public concern remains high. The draft minutes of the meeting are as below.\nSUTTON SOUTH COMMUNITY / POLICE MEETING. 15 JANUARY 2025 Attended by PC Robyn Skivens and PCSO Helen Maguire for the police. A report was given on main crime trends from 1 September to the date of the meeting. DRUG OFFENCES There had been 18 drug offences, mainly possession of drugs, mainly cannabis. While this was higher than normal the increase was partly attributable to a special police operation at Sutton train station. Four of these crimes were the interception by the Border Force of drug shipments. Where such a shipment is to premises in our Ward it will count in our statistics. BURGLARY There had been 21 burglaries or attempted burglaries. This included residential burglaries, burglaries of garages and sheds, and some burglaries of businesses. It was noted that there was usually a seasonal increase in burglary at this time of year as it was darker earlier. There had been eight residential burglaries. However, some that had been reported in sheltered accommodation in the Ward were later disproved and attributed to dementia. A disturbing case was that of a landlord who was able to let himself into a flat and commit theft. Two burglaries of garages had involved theft of bicycles. Mention was made of a shop in Brighton Road where the window was smashed and the wooden panel that was then put in place to secure the premises was pulled away to facilitate burglary. Mention was made of the theft of tools from a construction site in the Ward. Some burglaries had involved the theft of keys, which were then used to commit further offences (theft of a car key leading to theft of a car). The police stressed the need to make sure keys were kept out of sight – if the keys can be seen from your letterbox you are inviting crime.\nVEHICLE CRIME\nThere had been 14 instances of vehicle crime (theft of vehicles, damage to vehicles, theft from vehicles). The police stressed the need to avoid leaving anything of value on display in your car, or in the car at all. An unusual crime had been the theft of an excavator and a dumper from the road works in Brighton Road. THEFT There had been 23 crimes in a category the police described as “theft and kindred (to theft)” events. This included shoplifting, parcel theft, theft of pedal cycles and mobile phones. Examples mentioned included theft of scrap metal, theft of a wheelie bin and theft of a wedding ring by distraction techniques. MAJOR CRIMES There had been nine major, violent crimes in the Ward. This included several robberies at the train station, a large group altercation outside a restaurant, a fight between two drug users, and a concerning incident of a woman who was followed from the station and robbed. There were also two incidents of arson, of a bin and of a Ford transit. A ULEZ camera was deliberately damaged. There was an incident where a drug user was searched and a knife, and bladed articles, were found to be in his possession. There was a disturbing incident of an anti-semitic symbol being daubed on a wall outside the synagogue in Cedar Road. There had been a succession of incidents related to a woman living in Cedar Road who had engaged in anti- social activities that had attracted a community of drug users to her premises. This was now the subject of police reports to the DPS that were expected to lead to her being charged with serious offences. SPEEDING The police had been conducting a programme of visits to local care homes and sheltered housing to talk about scams. Residents had raised with them concerns about speeding in Cavendish Road, which had led to police action in that road. There was a discussion of speeding in local roads including Chalgrove Road, Langley Park Road, The Ridgway and Cavendish Road. The police had been carrying out speed checks in Chalgrove Road and Cavendish Road. The action in Cavendish Road had led to twelve drivers receiving warnings. The police would consider further action against speeding in local roads, subject to resources.\nOTHER MATTERS DISCUSSED Staffing levels: There should be in theory be a third officer on the Ward to support Robyn and Helen, but they were coping. The number of “extractions” when they were called away to join police exercises elsewhere in London, or at the Croydon custody suite, remained an issue of concern but was now running close to 35% of their time rather than the 50% it had once been. Mention was made of local concern about a story that a body had been discovered at a house in Egmont Road. The police assured the meeting that there was no wider implication of this incident. The next meeting was tentatively scheduled for Wednesday 14 May at Devonshire Avenue school (7pm) subject to the police checking their work rota. The meeting thanked Robyn for coming back from leave to attend the meeting and thanked the officers for their work for the community in dealing with crime in the Ward. The meeting thanked Fiona Ostler for letting us meet at the school. The date of the next meeting was provisionally set as Wednesday 14 May, at Devonshire Avenue primary school and thought continues to be given to what could be done to better publicise the meeting and get a better attendance.\nConstable Skivens, Louise, Trish and Richard with other Ward police officers at the Sutton South Hello Christmas party\nThe Phoenix Concert Band – which is based in our Ward and for which Richard plays trumpet – were busy over the Christmas period raising money for the Mayor of Sutton’s charity appeal. The band practices every Friday in the church at Christchurch in Christchurch Park. A concert in the church, staged by the band in December, drew an audience of over a hundred and raised £790 for the charity appeal. The band also played Christmas carols at an event in the Straw cafe in Manor Park in December, which raised £360. On the last Saturday before Christmas the band joined a wider group of musicians to play Christmas carols in the atrium of the St Nicholas shopping centre in Sutton (see photo) which raised £180, so £1330 in all. We were grateful to the Mayor, Councillor Colin Stears, who attended all these events. In addition the band played a concert at the Friends’ Meeting House in Cedar Road on the second Saturday in December, to entertain an enthusiastic audience before the “Second Saturday Tea” which the Quakers provide every month on the second Saturday. The Mayor of Sutton’s charities are Home-Start, Sutton, and Sutton, Kingston and Epsom – Parkinson’s UK. Our contribution to the appeal was dwarfed by the £10 000 prize for second place in the boroughs’ competition won by the Sutton float in the London New Year’s Day parade.\nWe pride ourselves on the fact that we have a network of dedicated volunteers who deliver our “FOCUS” magazine throughout the Ward. If you have the odd half hour a few times a year to support us in this way please contact us. We recently prepared an end of year newsletter to update our volunteer deliverers on our activities. We thought we would share it with those who look at our website.\n“The last year has been our most successful year in Sutton South Ward. With the election of Luke as our Member of Parliament in July we have, for the first time, three Liberal Democrat Councillors representing our Ward and a Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament representing us at Westminster. We held a successful Ward meeting on 28 November where we heard from Luke on the incredibly busy life he now has as our Member of Parliament. He has been meeting all the important community groups in Sutton and Cheam, and has made speeches in Parliament on a variety of issues – ranging from the importance of support for carers to the future of Taiwan. In his maiden speech he spoke about what a pleasant place Sutton is to live, work and raise a family, a great change from the previous MP who spent all his time running Sutton down. He is enthusiastic about his role as spokesperson for London. As Ward Councillors, we have a lot of local casework that we deal with and are doing more than our fair bit as Chairs of Council committees – Trish chairing the Audit and Governance Committee, Richard the Planning Committee and Louise combining being chair of the Licensing Committee with her role as Deputy Mayor. This is her second year as Deputy Mayor following the three years during which Trish was Mayor.\nLike every local authority, Sutton Council is pre-occupied by financial issues and struggling with some difficult decisions to balance the books. The decision to close the Registrar’s office (The Russetings) in Worcester Road was one we regretted, driven by a need to consolidate services in fewer buildings, but we believe planning controls are sufficient to protect the appearance of this attractive, locally listed, building in the street scene.\nWe have secured funding for improvements to the WArd, including new information signs at the only open space in our Ward – the Devonshire Avenue Nature Area (DANA). Maintenance of the nature area involves a balance of ensuring it is a peaceful place for people to visit while preserving the biodiversity of the site. There is now a Friends of DANA group – let us know if you would like to join it. We are already looking forward to our next electoral challenge, to retain control of the Council in 2026. We need to keep up the work of talking to our residents, delivering our literature and doorknocking. Let us know if you are interested in being one of our candidates. We welcome talking or corresponding with you and with all our residents. We hope to have further Ward meetings next year. We are really grateful for the help we get.”\nSutton South Councillors were concerned to learn about changes proposed to the organisation of the Police Cadets, who meet at a school in our ward. Currently there are over 120 cadets. However, the decision has been made to close junior cadets and cut the remaining senior cadets to just 46. Their future programme is also being severely curtailed. This will have a major impact on the youth of this borough who will no longer have the opportunity to participate in activities such as camps, parades and Duke of Edinburgh awards.\nCouncillor Louise Phelan, whose son has been a Cadet, commented “I’ve seen first-hand the benefits of being part of police cadets. They learn valuable life skills, and gain self confidence. They also support the local community and get to take part in things they wouldn’t otherwise have had the opportunity to do. For many this is a stepping stone into a career within the police force, for others the Cadets help to keep them on the right path and make better life decisions. I am incredibly concerned others will now not get these opportunities.”",
  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_2011_04_08_going-green-to-save-the-small-blue/content_455.html": "Residents are being urged to use their green-fingered skills to help save a tiny endangered butterfly.\nThe Small Blue is one of the UK’s rarest butterflies and in London is only established in a few locations, including in an area of Sutton.\nAs its name suggests, it is Britain’s smallest resident butterfly with a wing span that can be as little as 16mm. But numbers have plummeted in recent years due to the loss of chalk grassland habitats.\nNow householders in Sutton South are being encouraged to save the Small Blue by growing kidney vetch, one of the main plants on which the butterflies feed and breed.\nKidney vetch only flourishes on poor nutrient, alkaline soils.\nCllr Heather Honour, one of the local ward councillors on Sutton Council, said: “We want local people to get involved and help save this beautiful butterfly. They can grow kidney vetch in their gardens or allotments, and we hope local landlords and businesses will also plant it on their land.\n“The response from residents so far has been excellent, with a large number of people, children from the local primary school and several local organisations saying they want to help. Together we can help the Small Blue to thrive.”\nThe call to help protect the butterfly came as plans were announced to build\na small climbing frame for young children in the Devonshire Avenue Local Nature Area.\nEnvironmental campaigners feared the climbing frame could pose a risk to the Small Blue, whose habitat is in the area.\nCllr Honour said: “There are currently no playgrounds anywhere else in the ward, which is an area where 50 per cent of homes do not have a back garden. Hopefully this is a solution which will help both the butterflies and our young people to flourish.”\nHendryk Jurk, biodiversity manager at Sutton Council, said: “Kidney vetch is a reasonably easy plant to grow and can be cultivated in people’s back gardens, though it does need to be properly maintained.”\nResidents will be able to learn more about the butterfly and growing kidney vetch at an event at the site on June 25.\nTo get involved contact Cllr Honour at heather.honour@sutton.gov.uk\nWatch this website for details of the Sutton South Butterfly Watch Devonshire Avenue Nature Area June 25th 12 noon",
  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_category_news_page_30/content_761.html": "On the day when the House of Commons approved Government proposals to weaken planning law in respect of house extensions, Richard has drawn attention to the motion he successfully moved at the Sutton Council meeting last November, calling for this policy to be scrapped.\nAnd he has congratulated our MP Paul Burstow on voting against the proposal.\nThe motion moved by Richard at the Council meeting on 5 November said:\n“This Council opposes … the Secretary of State’s proposals for planning permission – currently required for extensions of more than three or four metres from the rear wall of any home – to only be needed for those reaching beyond 8m for detached homes and 6m for others.”\nRichard says “Sutton Council passed my motion to call on the Government to change its mind. I am sorry it has not yet done so. This policy weakens planning law further and will lead to neighbour on neighbour disputes over ugly extensions. It is a recipe for neighbourhood disputes and the erection of ugly buildings that society does not want, and that we certainly do not want in Sutton. ”\nThe motion pased on 5 November was also critical of the envisaged interference of the Planning Inspectorate in local decisions on planning applications, affordable housing and section 106 contributions.\nThis is the full text of Richard’s speech:\n“It is right that the London Borough of Sutton, which has been at the intellectual vanguard of so many policies in local Government, should be at the forefront in leading a campaign against the proposals of the Government to weaken planning law.\nThe motion is a balanced motion in that we are complimenting the Government on aspects of the announcement made on 6 September that we support, but we are making clear what we oppose.\nWe support proposals concerning the funding of new affordable housing, the refurbishment of empty homes, support for the FirstBuy shared equity scheme and support for housing associations.\nBut we are critical of the extension of permitted development rights, and the envisaged interference of the Planning Inspectorate in local decisions on planning applications, affordable housing and section 106 contributions.\nWhat we are saying tonight is entirely consistent with our actions and our words on planning issues.\nIt is consistent with our words in that we had an excellent debate on planning policy at the Council meeting on 17 October last year. I remember speaking in that debate and noting what we have achieved in Sutton in adopting and refining a planning policy that has secured the green, pleasant, suburban character of Sutton that we all treasure. But we noted in that debate threats and concerns that arose from national policy. We welcomed many aspects of the National Planning Policy Framework but saw four difficulties with the planning system that should be addressed – and for each of these I could cite specific examples in Sutton South Ward:\n1. that what is permitted development is already quite permissive and is leading to people building large and intrusive structures that should be brought within planning controls\n2. that the planning system is slow moving in dealing with developers who are recalcitrant and play the system\n3. the decisions of the Planning Inspectorate are sometimes inconsistent and unhelpful\n4. the Courts do not always seem to take breaches of planning law seriously.\nThese problems remain but, sadly, the Government has not taken our advice set out in the motion we passed. Indeed, it has moved in an opposite direction in what is now proposed.\nWhat is proposed seems to abandon the National Planning Policy Framework, does not address any of the problems that concerned us, and loosens further permitted development law.\nI do not believe for one second that the relaxation of requirements to seek planning permission for extensions to domestic properties is going to unleash an avalanche of building work, thus creating jobs. To the extent that this happens, it follows that this will be through the erection of buildings that would not be permitted under current arrangements. So this is a recipe for neighbourhood disputes and the erection of ugly buildings that society does not want, and that we certainly do not want in Sutton.\nI also particularly object to the way the package deals with affordable housing and section 106 contributions. Like most of you, I find that quite a lot of my casework as a Councillor involves families that are living in poor circumstances, often because they cannot find and afford accommodation that fits their needs. We desperately need more affordable housing. There are already “get out” clauses for developers who present financial analyses seemingly proving their development is unviable if they have to provide affordable housing. I am deeply suspicious of those processes and now there are to be further “get out” routes involving the Planning Inspectorate.\nWhat we say in this motion is also consistent with our actions. We have adopted stringent controls on development to ensure it meets the local needs of Sutton, particularly on the development of major sites and on back garden development. We do not want these interfered with by remote bodies in Whitehall and Bristol.\nWe have worked hard to control development in Sutton in a way that meets what local people want. And so much flows from the way the character of the area is preserved by our planning policies, making it an attractive environment for businesses and families. I never tire of telling people of the virtues of Sutton – low crime, good schools, attractive leafy streets, good transport connections, voted the best place in London to bring up children, a local economy that is surviving the recession well. All these things, to my mind, hinge crucially on having an attractive local environment and street scene.\nI hope these proposals will be re-thought.\nI strongly believe, in the words of the motion, that it is local people, through democratically elected local authorities, who are the best judges of what development is acceptable in an area.\nI commend this motion to Council.”",

Sutton Central Ward is immediately north of our Ward, Sutton South.\nRichard got more votes than all the other six candidates added together. The result was\nLiberal Democrats 1291\nConservatives 327\nReform 282\nLabour 216\nThree other candidates (the Greens, an independent and the Christian People’s Alliance) each got less than 100 votes.\nThe Liberal Democrat share of the vote increased by 17.4%, the Conservatives fell by 10% and Labour – who finished second in this seat in 2022 – by 17.4%.\nOn 3 March the Council discussed the budget proposals for the coming year. Legally, the Council is required to set a balanced budget. With so many Councils going bust or in great financial difficulty, this was always going to be a difficult task. The problems are due to a legacy of Government cuts but also a big spike in demand for services. While people think of the Council as the body that mends the potholes, empties the bins and fixes the street lights, 70% of spending is on adult social care and children’s services (particularly for those children with special educational needs), plus the cost of finding accommodation for the homeless. There has been an increase in demand in the past year, particularly in the number of adults whose social care has to be paid for by the Council, the number of children with special educational needs and in the number of homeless families.\nRichard spoke in the debate, on homelessness – a subject in which he has a special interest due to the work history of his daughter, Ellie, who worked for many years for a homelessness charity and because as chair of Planning Committee he has a role in increasing the supply of affordable family accommodation.\nHere is Richard’s speech:\n“I would like to direct the attention of Council to paragraph 8.11 of the supplemental agenda which is discussing financial risks.\nIt says that the biggest driver of overspending by London boroughs is the number of people presenting as homeless and who need to be offered temporary accommodation.\nThe paper tells us Sutton had 1 084 households homeless and in temporary accommodation in October last year. It is a higher figure tonight. It is a frightening figure. Tonight we are discussing homelessness as a financial risk to the Council, but we all recognise that the fundamental reason for our concern is that behind so many of these cases are stories of tragedy, of families losing their homes and often winding up in bed and breakfast accommodation remote from their workplace and remote from the schools their children attend.\nThere is a housing crisis and we need more homes. Residents comment on the number of new flats being built in the centre of Sutton but we need this accommodation.\nThe aspiration of the Government to build more homes is right – but it has to be tempered by a concern about quality and about dealing with the consequences.\nSutton is very built up. It is not always easy to see where the new homes will come from, particularly when we are all rightly sensitive to the concerns of residents about inappropriate development and the pressures intensification can bring.\nIt is worthwhile re-stating the principles in our local plan for Sutton.\nWe need more housing, but it must be of good quality – good enough for Sutton, which means of high quality.\nWe aim to reduce development pressures on what I call the “suburban heartland” of the borough by concentrating development in the areas where development is appropriate.\nIn particular there is a zone of potential intensification close to the town centre where public transport connections are good. This may mean some tall buildings. It may mean car free or car light development as you can provide much more accommodation if you do not have to provide a parking space for every unit, and this is more acceptable in areas close to the railway station and the town centre where public transport connections are good.\nWe have a local plan, currently under review, which sets out how we meet the requirements for infrastructure to support an increase in population, which is an important concern of residents.\nI am always keen to point out that our local plan is not like the local plan you might find in, for example, North Korea, mandating what will be built. It is aspirational. It depends on developers bringing forward proposals. Its success depends a lot on the skills of our planning staff in negotiating with developers to secure what is good for Sutton, which may not be what makes most profit for the developer. I would like to pay tribute to the work of our planning staff and in particular the head, Andy Webber, who retires this month.\nIn the past year the planning system has had a bad press. The Government says we are going for growth, growth, growth. Quite right. But when asked what are the impediments to growth they invariably cite the planning system – which is represented as run by NIMBYS frustrating necessary development. That might well be the case in some places – not here in Sutton of course. But I think there is a counter argument that the planning system is a bastion against having fields and fields of sub-standard housing, as that is what makes money for developers. We destroy the planning system at our peril. But it is also right that we need a planning system that does not stand in the way of necessary change and renewal, but ensures high quality and appropriate development, to provide housing and to stimulate the economy.\nI think we have a good track record in Sutton in supporting high quality development and there are many examples in our borough of developments characterised by good design providing quality housing and infrastructure. That is what we need.”\nThe bench at the junction of The Ridgway and Mayfield Road\nThere are a number of locations in our Ward where there are benches to enable weary pedestrians to put up their feet. At the most recent meeting of the Council’s local committee we got agreement to re-new two benches in the Ward that have deteriorated over time. These are benches in Copse Hill and the one in the photograph, which is at the junction of The Ridgway and Mayfield Road.\nThere is a history to some of the benches in our Ward. In 1988 the South Sutton Neighbourhood Association celebrated the tenth anniversary of its foundation by funding a bench in Cavendish Road close to Ambleside Gardens. The bench was, after over twenty years of use and exposure to the elements, in a very sorry state. We took action to get the bench restored, with the plaque explaining the history of the bench moved to the new bench.\nOn the 27th of January Sutton Council met. Richard raised the issue of the reasons why a recent survey by The Times newspaper ranked Sutton as the eighth most attractive place to live in England. This finding does not surprise us. We spend a lot of time knocking on the doors of our residents to introduce ourselves as your local Councillors and we find people generally say they really like Sutton, mentioning a strong sense of community, open spaces, low crime, good schools, a green and pleasant environment, parks, street trees, being convenient for London and for the countryside. This is particularly the case with people who have moved to Sutton from elsewhere, particularly those from other London boroughs, from Hong Kong and from Ukraine. Please write to us and tell us what you like about Sutton or think we can improve.\nWe are always keen to look at ways of improving our Ward.\nLast year traffic engineers undertook a study of traffic flows in our Ward and the results of the exercise are listed in a later post on this site. The results have not led to some “standout” conclusion as to a problem that needs tackling but traffic officers are examining three main issues:\nwhether action can be taken to improve the safety and the experience of pedestrians crossing the Kings Lane bridge without closing the road to vehicles. The bridge is narrow. Installing a second bridge would be impossibly expensive. Marking a pedestrian path at one side of the road might be feasible. We would welcome the views of users of the bridge, both pedestrians and motorists\nsimilarly, whether something can be done to improve the safety and the experience of pedestrians passing under the railway bridge in Langley Park Road. Some proposals are to be consulted on\npossible improvements to the busy junction where Cedar Road crosses Langley Park Road. Residents have spoken to us of the difficulties pedestrians have in crossing Langley Park Road. Consultation with residents in adjacent streets is underway on proposals to install two new traffic islands in Langley Park Road. These will form a safe area in the middle of the road so the road can be crossed by pedestrians in two phases.\nYour views on these issues, and views on any other traffic and parking issues you would like us to look at would be welcomed.\nThe police met residents of Sutton South Ward again on the evening of 15 January 2025, at Devonshire Avenue school. There are open, public meetings held quarterly at which the police discuss the policing of the Ward with local residents. We were addressed by our Ward Constable, Constable Robyn Skivens, who went through the crime statistics for the Ward. Sutton has a lower crime rate than most outer London boroughs and our Ward has one of the lowest crime rates in Sutton. However, crime always has a significant impact on the victim and public concern remains high. The draft minutes of the meeting are as below.\nSUTTON SOUTH COMMUNITY / POLICE MEETING. 15 JANUARY 2025 Attended by PC Robyn Skivens and PCSO Helen Maguire for the police. A report was given on main crime trends from 1 September to the date of the meeting. DRUG OFFENCES There had been 18 drug offences, mainly possession of drugs, mainly cannabis. While this was higher than normal the increase was partly attributable to a special police operation at Sutton train station. Four of these crimes were the interception by the Border Force of drug shipments. Where such a shipment is to premises in our Ward it will count in our statistics. BURGLARY There had been 21 burglaries or attempted burglaries. This included residential burglaries, burglaries of garages and sheds, and some burglaries of businesses. It was noted that there was usually a seasonal increase in burglary at this time of year as it was darker earlier. There had been eight residential burglaries. However, some that had been reported in sheltered accommodation in the Ward were later disproved and attributed to dementia. A disturbing case was that of a landlord who was able to let himself into a flat and commit theft. Two burglaries of garages had involved theft of bicycles. Mention was made of a shop in Brighton Road where the window was smashed and the wooden panel that was then put in place to secure the premises was pulled away to facilitate burglary. Mention was made of the theft of tools from a construction site in the Ward. Some burglaries had involved the theft of keys, which were then used to commit further offences (theft of a car key leading to theft of a car). The police stressed the need to make sure keys were kept out of sight – if the keys can be seen from your letterbox you are inviting crime.\nVEHICLE CRIME\nThere had been 14 instances of vehicle crime (theft of vehicles, damage to vehicles, theft from vehicles). The police stressed the need to avoid leaving anything of value on display in your car, or in the car at all. An unusual crime had been the theft of an excavator and a dumper from the road works in Brighton Road. THEFT There had been 23 crimes in a category the police described as “theft and kindred (to theft)” events. This included shoplifting, parcel theft, theft of pedal cycles and mobile phones. Examples mentioned included theft of scrap metal, theft of a wheelie bin and theft of a wedding ring by distraction techniques. MAJOR CRIMES There had been nine major, violent crimes in the Ward. This included several robberies at the train station, a large group altercation outside a restaurant, a fight between two drug users, and a concerning incident of a woman who was followed from the station and robbed. There were also two incidents of arson, of a bin and of a Ford transit. A ULEZ camera was deliberately damaged. There was an incident where a drug user was searched and a knife, and bladed articles, were found to be in his possession. There was a disturbing incident of an anti-semitic symbol being daubed on a wall outside the synagogue in Cedar Road. There had been a succession of incidents related to a woman living in Cedar Road who had engaged in anti- social activities that had attracted a community of drug users to her premises. This was now the subject of police reports to the DPS that were expected to lead to her being charged with serious offences. SPEEDING The police had been conducting a programme of visits to local care homes and sheltered housing to talk about scams. Residents had raised with them concerns about speeding in Cavendish Road, which had led to police action in that road. There was a discussion of speeding in local roads including Chalgrove Road, Langley Park Road, The Ridgway and Cavendish Road. The police had been carrying out speed checks in Chalgrove Road and Cavendish Road. The action in Cavendish Road had led to twelve drivers receiving warnings. The police would consider further action against speeding in local roads, subject to resources.\nOTHER MATTERS DISCUSSED Staffing levels: There should be in theory be a third officer on the Ward to support Robyn and Helen, but they were coping. The number of “extractions” when they were called away to join police exercises elsewhere in London, or at the Croydon custody suite, remained an issue of concern but was now running close to 35% of their time rather than the 50% it had once been. Mention was made of local concern about a story that a body had been discovered at a house in Egmont Road. The police assured the meeting that there was no wider implication of this incident. The next meeting was tentatively scheduled for Wednesday 14 May at Devonshire Avenue school (7pm) subject to the police checking their work rota. The meeting thanked Robyn for coming back from leave to attend the meeting and thanked the officers for their work for the community in dealing with crime in the Ward. The meeting thanked Fiona Ostler for letting us meet at the school. The date of the next meeting was provisionally set as Wednesday 14 May, at Devonshire Avenue primary school and thought continues to be given to what could be done to better publicise the meeting and get a better attendance.\nConstable Skivens, Louise, Trish and Richard with other Ward police officers at the Sutton South Hello Christmas party\nThe Phoenix Concert Band – which is based in our Ward and for which Richard plays trumpet – were busy over the Christmas period raising money for the Mayor of Sutton’s charity appeal. The band practices every Friday in the church at Christchurch in Christchurch Park. A concert in the church, staged by the band in December, drew an audience of over a hundred and raised £790 for the charity appeal. The band also played Christmas carols at an event in the Straw cafe in Manor Park in December, which raised £360. On the last Saturday before Christmas the band joined a wider group of musicians to play Christmas carols in the atrium of the St Nicholas shopping centre in Sutton (see photo) which raised £180, so £1330 in all. We were grateful to the Mayor, Councillor Colin Stears, who attended all these events. In addition the band played a concert at the Friends’ Meeting House in Cedar Road on the second Saturday in December, to entertain an enthusiastic audience before the “Second Saturday Tea” which the Quakers provide every month on the second Saturday. The Mayor of Sutton’s charities are Home-Start, Sutton, and Sutton, Kingston and Epsom – Parkinson’s UK. Our contribution to the appeal was dwarfed by the £10 000 prize for second place in the boroughs’ competition won by the Sutton float in the London New Year’s Day parade.\nWe pride ourselves on the fact that we have a network of dedicated volunteers who deliver our “FOCUS” magazine throughout the Ward. If you have the odd half hour a few times a year to support us in this way please contact us. We recently prepared an end of year newsletter to update our volunteer deliverers on our activities. We thought we would share it with those who look at our website.\n“The last year has been our most successful year in Sutton South Ward. With the election of Luke as our Member of Parliament in July we have, for the first time, three Liberal Democrat Councillors representing our Ward and a Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament representing us at Westminster. We held a successful Ward meeting on 28 November where we heard from Luke on the incredibly busy life he now has as our Member of Parliament. He has been meeting all the important community groups in Sutton and Cheam, and has made speeches in Parliament on a variety of issues – ranging from the importance of support for carers to the future of Taiwan. In his maiden speech he spoke about what a pleasant place Sutton is to live, work and raise a family, a great change from the previous MP who spent all his time running Sutton down. He is enthusiastic about his role as spokesperson for London. As Ward Councillors, we have a lot of local casework that we deal with and are doing more than our fair bit as Chairs of Council committees – Trish chairing the Audit and Governance Committee, Richard the Planning Committee and Louise combining being chair of the Licensing Committee with her role as Deputy Mayor. This is her second year as Deputy Mayor following the three years during which Trish was Mayor.\nLike every local authority, Sutton Council is pre-occupied by financial issues and struggling with some difficult decisions to balance the books. The decision to close the Registrar’s office (The Russetings) in Worcester Road was one we regretted, driven by a need to consolidate services in fewer buildings, but we believe planning controls are sufficient to protect the appearance of this attractive, locally listed, building in the street scene.\nWe have secured funding for improvements to the WArd, including new information signs at the only open space in our Ward – the Devonshire Avenue Nature Area (DANA). Maintenance of the nature area involves a balance of ensuring it is a peaceful place for people to visit while preserving the biodiversity of the site. There is now a Friends of DANA group – let us know if you would like to join it. We are already looking forward to our next electoral challenge, to retain control of the Council in 2026. We need to keep up the work of talking to our residents, delivering our literature and doorknocking. Let us know if you are interested in being one of our candidates. We welcome talking or corresponding with you and with all our residents. We hope to have further Ward meetings next year. We are really grateful for the help we get.”\nSutton South Councillors were concerned to learn about changes proposed to the organisation of the Police Cadets, who meet at a school in our ward. Currently there are over 120 cadets. However, the decision has been made to close junior cadets and cut the remaining senior cadets to just 46. Their future programme is also being severely curtailed. This will have a major impact on the youth of this borough who will no longer have the opportunity to participate in activities such as camps, parades and Duke of Edinburgh awards.\nCouncillor Louise Phelan, whose son has been a Cadet, commented “I’ve seen first-hand the benefits of being part of police cadets. They learn valuable life skills, and gain self confidence. They also support the local community and get to take part in things they wouldn’t otherwise have had the opportunity to do. For many this is a stepping stone into a career within the police force, for others the Cadets help to keep them on the right path and make better life decisions. I am incredibly concerned others will now not get these opportunities.”",
  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_2018_06_03_5861/content_619.html": "We regret that local democracy has again been overruled by the remote Planning Inspectorate, based in Bristol. The proposed development of 81 and 83 Langley Park Road to demolish the houses and build a block of nine flats was turned down by Sutton Council but then granted on appeal by the Planning Inspectorate.\nThe concerns of the Council largely related to design. We expect high quality standards of development in our Ward and could envisage a much more attractive development if this proposal was to go ahead. There were also issues about car parking, traffic and congestion, largely dismissed by the Inspector in his report.\nOur concern is with the outcome but also with the system. The Planning Inspectorate seems to us to have a bias in favour of development, come what may, and it seems wrong that local decisions taken by locally elected Councillors reflecting a local plan can be overturned with no further right of appeal.\nWhile this is a disappointing outcome, we will, as your local Councillors, continue to seek acceptable standards in proposals for development in the Ward.",
  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_category_news_page_32/content_744.html": "Our long-running campaign to open the side entrance to Sutton station has taken a major step forward, with the acceptance of the Council’s submission to Transport for London of a bid for £740 000 worth of funding under the TfL Major Projects scheme.\nThe project, known as the Sutton Station Gateway Major Scheme bid, will need to be the subject of further negotiation, so is not finally home and dry, but we are hopeful that it will proceed next year following confirmation from Transport for London that the bid was successful. We have been awarded £740,000 for this scheme in the 2013/14 financial year.\nRichard says “We have made this a major campaign since we were elected. Initial setbacks, such as the rejection of a bid by the Mayor under the Outer London Fund Scheme, have not deterred us. If this now goes ahead it will be good news for the residents of Sutton South Ward, particularly who commute from Sutton station, giving easier access to the station and an improved frontage in The Quadrant.”\nSutton station is the 5th busiest in South London, and the 27th busiest in the whole of Greater London, with almost 6 million passenger movements every year. It is one of 18 stations in London identified by TfL as suffering significant congestion problems.\nThe main elements in the scheme not only include opening the side entrance but extensive landscaping to improve the appearance of what will in effect be a new entrance from The Quadrant. The main elements include:\n* Opening up the side entrance to the station to improve station access and egress, improve the streetscape and improve pedestrian access to the station\n* Public realm and footway improvements in The Quadrant and at the front of the station\n* Bus stop improvements at the front of the station to improve passenger experience\n* “De-cluttering” and harmonisation of street furniture and materials\n* Junction and crossing improvements on walking routes to the station\n* Road safety improvements\n* Additional cycle parking and cycle lanes, and\n* Improved street lighting.\nBenefits of the scheme will include reduced pedestrian journey times between the station and The Quadrant, the station car park and the Langley Park Road area, as well as reduced congestion within the station main entrance and at the barriers.\nOpening the side entrance at Sutton Station will cater for the considerable demand for direct access to the station from the Quadrant House office block, which houses Reed Business Information (with approximately 2,000 employees, about one third of whom travel to work by train) and a number of other expanding companies, together with the Tudor Court office block, which houses Synergy UK. The new entrance will also serve the large station car park (which Network Rail wish to expand), and the motorcycle and cycle parking areas, which generate considerable demand for access from that side of the station. There is also direct footpath access between The Quadrant and Langley Park Road and surrounding residential streets, well-used by rail passengers. These station users currently have to walk around the side to the front of the station on a convoluted route and negotiate busy footways, bus stops and the station entrance. Most of these passengers are likely to have season tickets, and opening up the side entrance will significantly reduce their journey times and congestion outside and in the entrance hall of the main station entrance.\nWhile the Council has been lobbying for the opening up of the side entrance since the entrance was created with a retractable shutter ten years ago, the campaign took on new impetus when Richard and Heather were elected in 2010. The entrance is opened up when rail replacement buses are used during engineering work, as the buses stop in The Quadrant. This demonstrates that it is possible to open and use the entrance. Southern has supported the opening in principle, subject to funding being available to provide the barriers etc. Network Rail has also supported the scheme in principle and has assisted with business case work.\nWe will keep readers advised of further progress in the negotiations that are now underway. At the Council meeting on 14 January Richard sought re-assurance that elements such as lighting in the Quadrant and cycle parking will not be lost.",

A further consultation exercise is about to take place on the installation of two new electric vehicle charging points in Mulgrave Road, close to the junction with Worcester Road. A preliminary consultation found majority support but few residents responded.\nThere are now charging points at the following locations:\nOpposite 49 The Ridgway\nOpposite 26 Langley Park Road\nOpposite Foxley Court in Christchurch Park\nOpposite 10 Cumnor Road\nIn Cedar Gardens\nOpposite Grange Court, Grange Road\nOpposite Thomas House, Grange Road\nOpposite 13 Stanley Road\nOpposite Fairford Court, Stanley Road\nWe want to draw attention to the Sutton Citizen space survey where residents should log their suggestions for EV charge points.\nhttps://sutton.citizenspace.com/highways-environment-and-planning/ev-survey/\nThe photo shows the first vehicle that used the first charging point in the Ward, in The Ridgway. Given the policy to ultimately phase out petrol driven vehicles, a big and continuing expansion will be needed.\nSutton Council is working with Siemens to install Ubitricity lamp column electric vehicle charging points. Ubitricity lamp column charging points are compact and fit into the door of a lamp column.\nThe aim of lamp column charging is to give residents the ability to easily charge electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles on the street where they live, especially if they do not have off-street parking or are unable to install their own home charging point. Installing residential charging points is important because a key barrier to people switching to electric vehicles is the concern around where they will be able to charge their vehicle.\nNot all lamp columns are suitable for lamp column charging points. The lamp columns need to be “electrically suitable”, be positioned near the kerb and have enough internal space to fit the charging point. They need to be sensibly located so that a vehicle could safely park and charge next to the lamp column. The lamp columns also need to be made of metal, not concrete.\nAn “earth mat”, a small metal grid, is also installed in the footway next to the lamp column. This is to make the charging point “electrically safe” if there is a fault. There are signs to indicate that the lamp column has a charging point fitted, though this sign will not prevent non-electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles from parking next to the lamp column.\nThis is a major advance in our drive to promote electric vehicles and combat global warming.",

The opportunity was taken, at the same time, to confirm with residents whether they want any changes made to the layout of this attractive local feature.\nThe small triangle of land at this road junction is planted with cotoneaster bushes and three flowering cherry trees. It is understood that up to about the mid-1980’s the area was grassed, though with the trees, and it was planted with cotoneaster bushes at the initiative of local residents. It is believed that there was an understanding that the residents would maintain the bushes, but the bushes have always been maintained by the Council.\nCorrespondence between residents about the maintenance of the cotoneaster bushes led Richard to convene a meeting at the triangle on 9 August 2012, attended by Bill Bailey, the Council officer in charge of the maintenance of hedges, and several local residents.\nMr. Bailey explained that the Council treated the cotoneaster bushes as a slow-growing hedge and cut them twice a year, normally in July and September. The difficulty arose with the first cut, as advice from the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds was not to cut any hedges till August, and by then it is likely that the cotoneaster bushes will have grown to a height that means they are interfering with the visibility of drivers. Drivers coming from Mayfield Road have difficulty seeing cars coming down The Ridgway, from the left, as they are obscured by the bushes. In recent years the cut had been scheduled for July but he had usually been alerted by a local resident to a developing safety problem and had immediately arranged for the bushes to be trimmed, ahead of their position in the schedule. The Council would be happy to adopt any solution that was acceptable to the residents.\nIn discussion the following points were made:\n– it seemed unlikely that birds would nest in these bushes, and residents did not believe that this was a real likelihood. Mr. Bailey said that the contractors would always check in any case, and he had no problem about arranging that the first cut would be earlier\n– options such as paving the edge of the area or reverting to grass had been proposed but were unpopular with residents, who generally liked the layout of the triangle as it is\n– an option would be to cut back the cotoneasters at the corners or along the part of the triangle fronting The Ridgway, but these solutions too would be unpopular\n– the problem could be avoided by scheduling an earlier cut, with the additional safeguard that any resident who felt a problem was arising before the first cut could contact the Council or a local Councillor (three LibDem Councillors live in The Ridgway), and the Council would arrange an immediate inspection and cut (if necessary). This was agreed to be the best solution.\nMr. Bailey has now written to the Council’s contractors instructing that next year the first cut will be in June. This will eliminate the potential road safety problem but without making more radical changes to the triangle that residents do not want.\nRichard said “There was a potential road safety issue here and I was pleased I was able to sort it out. It was good to take the opportunity to take views on the layout of what is an attractive feature of the area. I am glad we are not going to change it but can at the same time deal with the problem these bushes can cause.”",

It will now be held on Tuesday 26 March from 3pm to 9pm in addition to the exhibition on 19 March. Both events will be at the Holiday Inn in Sutton.\nRichard and Heather have had further meetings with Subsea7, and the following is the text of their letter sent to local residents.\n“Since we learned of the proposed redevelopment of the Brighton Road Car Park site, we have been working hard to tackle the parking issues that might arise for residents in Sutton South. Although this is still very much work in progress, we thought it a good time to bring you up to date with what is going on.\nAs you know, the high-tech engineering firm Subsea 7 want to expand their presence in Sutton by building a brand new state-of-the-art Head Quarters for their international business. This may bring up to 500 new jobs.\nThe new building will be much more attractive than the existing Brighton Road Car Park and will be designed by a renowned firm of architects, ESA. It will form part of a renewed “Gateway to Sutton” along the Brighton Road from the South that, in addition to new jobs, will provide extra spending power for local shops, restaurants and hotels.\nKeeping the company in Sutton will also protect over 300 jobs that the company currently have located in the Borough so that they do not move elsewhere.\nSubsea 7 have considered other buildings in Sutton that are currently empty, like Sutherland House, but have found that these are not satisfactory for the needs of an international headquarters.\nThe Council undertook a parking capacity study that showed that Council public car parks are only 53 per cent full during the peak weekday period. This means that there is therefore 47 per cent spare capacity.\nBut the report did not address the specific issue of increased on-road parking in the Highfields area and adjacent roads, including Upland Road and Farm Road. We immediately pointed this out to the Council and were told that its purpose was to ensure that the loss of parking in the Brighton Road Car Park would not damage the town centre’s economy.\nWe have therefore asked for work to be undertaken on the impact on car parking in the Highfields area and adjacent roads. We have also asked for financial incentives to encourage those drivers who currently use the Brighton Road Car Park to go to the Gibson Road Car Park rather than drive up to the area outside the controlled parking zone. These discussions are ongoing.\nWe have discussed with Subsea 7 our concerns about on-road parking in Sutton South and, as part of any planning application, they will be required to submit a traffic impact survey. We have asked that the traffic survey also considers where commuters will park as a result of these changes, And what local impact it will have. The results of this study will then be taken in to account by the Council when it negotiates with Subsea 7 about their financial obligations to the local community. This is part of the normal process with any large planning development.\nThe next steps are as follows:\n- Subsea 7 will hold an exhibition on the proposed development at the Holiday Inn on 19 March and 26 March, and we do encourage you to visit it.\n- The Council’s Strategy and Resources Committee (which is made up of a number of Sutton Councillors from both parties) will consider whether they can agree Heads of Agreement with Subsea 7. This is basically an agreement to go ahead, subject to planning permission. The meeting is open to the public.\n- If the Heads of Agreement are agreed, Subsea 7 can then apply for planning permission and all aspects of their application, including the impact on parking, will be assessed against current planning standards. Residents have the opportunity to submit their comments on the application and the decision will be taken by the Council’s Development Control Committee, again made up of Sutton’s elected Councillors.”",

There were a number of presentations and themes for discussion, after an introduction by Heather as Chair of the Steering Group.\nHeather reminded us that South Sutton Hello is an initiative to combat loneliness and isolation, supported by major local charities like AgeUK, Citizens’ Advice Bureau, Sutton Mental Health Foundation, and local residents’ Associations such as SSNA and the HRA. It is a non-political initiative with support from all political parties.\nIt was aunched at Christchurch on 9 May by the Care Minister, Norman Lamb MP and is intended to be a pilot for similar initiatives elsewhere. Sutton South Ward chosen as on the basis Campaign to End Social Isolation toolkit, it is a ward where the risk of social isolation is particularly high:\n– the Ward has the highest proportion of over 65’s of any Ward in Sutton\n– the proportion over 85 is double the Sutton and national average\n– there are a large number of people living in sheltered accommodation for the elderly or in single occupancy flats\n– over three quarters of residents live in purpose-built blocks of flats\n– almost half of all households are single person households\n– but a quarter of residents in the Ward say they regularly volunteer in some capacity, so there is a high level of community activism.\nThe project has drawn together a listing of the various community initiatives in Sutton South, particularly those run by the churches and AgeUK. It has produced a first newsletter and will follow this up with more. There are a number of specific activities it has promoted:\n– the Wednesday “Hello Club” at Christchurch run by SCILL (Sutton Centre for Independent Living and Learning)\n– Chair based exercise classes organised by AgeUK for the Sutton and Surrey Senior Citizens Club\n– The “Second Saturday” social club for older people at the Friends’ Meeting House, where attendance has increased five fold since the project started promoting it.\nAgeUK say there has been a 106% increase in callers from our Ward to its Information and Advice service since the project started promoting it. The project is seeking volunteers, particularly as befrienders. These are organised by the Sutton Centre for Independent Living and Learning. There is a phone number 0208 770 4065, or email information@scill.org.uk.\nAt its meeting, following the discussion, the Committee agreed the extension of controlled parking to Eastleigh Close, a project Richard has championed on behalf of the residents there, who have voted for it in successive consultation exercises.\nThe Commmittee also agreed to a proposal Richard made for additional “20mph” roundels in the road in the Sutton South 20mph area, to combat speeding.",

The Mayor is invited to present these awards. This service ranged from acts of bravery to prevent crime to systematic action and campaigns to reduce crime. We are delighted that PC Towler received an award, recognising his work to reduce crime in our area, the citation reading “commended for motivation, commitment and drive to reduce anti-social behaviour in Sutton South ward linked to the supply of drugs, through the use of search warrants and arrest of offenders, improving the quality of life for his residents.”",

This involved the closure of the part of Stanley Road adjacent to the school for a short period in the morning and afternoon, when the school day starts and ends.\nThe objectives of school streets are:\n1) To improve safety around the school at start and finish time\n2) To improve air quality for children outside their school gates (small people are particularly vulnerable to emissions from cars)\n3) To create a more welcoming atmosphere around the school, where children can walk in the road and parents can feel more relaxed.\nThe scheme was a six month trial funded by Transport for London, who set the parameters of the scheme. The scheme was withdrawn in advance of the conclusion of the six month trial following a legal challenge to the lawfulness of such schemes, but by then it was proposed to withdraw the scheme. This related to difficulties experienced in enforcing the traffic controls, which at successful “school street” schemes involved the participation of the school and parents.",

This included not requiring workers to have to manipulate heavy metal bins that were damaged and would not roll on their wheels, and not bumping the heavy bins up and down kerbs. At Redruth House, in Grange Road, this created a problem as one of the bin stores, built when the block was constructed in 1969, faces onto the pavement in Camborne Road. It was only possible for the binmen to empty the large metal bins if they could be bumped across the pavement and down the kerb into the road, to the cart. The rough treatment had damaged the bins.\nApproached by the Residents’ Association, Richard’s solution was to work with Council officers to get the bins repaired and a “dropped kerb” put in so the bins can be rolled into the road. A white line deters car users from blocking the dropped kerb by parking there.\nThe Association (the Redruth House Sutton Residents Co. Ltd.), which is in effect a committee of residents who act as “managing agents” for the block, invited Richard to their Annual General Meeting on 24 October, where he was warmly thanked. Richard said he endorsed the view of the chair of the Company, in his annual report that:\n“Redruth House enjoys the reputation of being one of the best managed blocks in Sutton.”\nHe thought this was, in part, because the blocks are managed by a committee of residents and not a remote and disinterested managing agent company.",

The staff, parents, governors and of course, our wonderfully talented children, fully deserve this recognition.”\nCllr Kirsty Jerome, Executive Member for Education and Schools at Sutton Council, said: “This is a great result for the pupils, staff and parents at Devonshire Primary School who have worked so hard over the last three years. They should be very proud of themselves and this report, which highlights the excellent learning and social opportunities available at the school.”\nThe result follows the expansion of Devonshire Primary, which saw three new classrooms open in September 2011.\nIt was one of four to expand as the number of places needed in Sutton continues to rise. Beddington Park, Dorchester and Muschamp primaries also expanded this year, and another five – All Saints Benhilton Church of England Primary, All Saints Carshalton Church of England Primary, Brookfield Primary, The Federation of St Elphege’s Catholic Infants and Junior and Cheam Common Infants – will be enlarged in time for the next school year.\nSutton’s primary school pupils achieved the third best SATs results in the country this year, and at GCSE level Sutton came top.\nNEW POLLING ARRANGEMENTS WILL HELP LOCAL SCHOOLS\nWe have supported, and been instrumental in extending, proposals that will reduce disruption at local schools every time there is an election.\nSutton Council recently completed a review of polling areas and polling stations, something it is required by law to conduct at set intervals.\nWe have long been aware of a concern on the part of parents of children at Devonshire Avenue primary school, the school that most primary-age school children in our Ward attend, of the disruptive effect of closing the school for a day to use it as a polling station. It disrupts the education of the children and creates a child-care issue for many parents, particularly those who work and may need to take a day off work as the school is closed. Consequently we have supported the proposal to consider, as an alternative, the use of the hall of Christchurch church in Christchurch Park. We are pleased that this proposal is now likely to be agreed.\nDuring this consultation exercise Richard was approached by parents who live in Sutton South Ward but who send their children to Barrow Hedges school, which is just outside the Ward, making the point that similar considerations (the disruptive effect to the education of the children and the impact on parents) apply in respect of Barrow Hedges school. This led Richard to promote considering the use of the Baptist church hall in Banstead Road as an alternative. At the meeting of Sutton Council on 5 December the proposal will be put to it that in future neither Devonshire Avenue school nor Barrow Hedges school be used as polling stations. We support these proposals as they will avoid the disruption to the life of these schools that is involved in closing them for a day every time there is an election.\nSUTTON STUDENTS ACHIEVE THE BEST GCSE RESULTS IN THE COUNTRY\nStudents at Sutton schools achieved the best GCSE results in the country this summer.\nSutton’s schoolchildren topped the results table, published in October, with 74.4 per cent achieving five or more A*-C grades including maths and English. The national average was 58.3 per cent, while 62.2 per cent of outer London pupils achieved the benchmark this summer.\nAn impressive 91.2 per cent of Sutton’s 16-year-olds earned five or more A*-C grades in any subject, compared to an outer London average of 82.7 per cent.\nThis is excellent news and confirms something we have known for a long time; that Sutton has some of the very best schools in the country. To top the table, ahead of every other local authority area in England, is a real achievement, and one that teachers, parents and students will be delighted about. All those pupils who took GCSE exams this summer should be very proud of themselves.\nThe local authority looks forward to working in partnership with those schools which have since become academies, to ensure these results continue.\nIn August it was revealed that Sutton pupils had achieved their best ever SATs results, placing the borough third in the national league table. The tests in reading, writing and mathematics, are taken by 11-year-olds at the end of their primary education.\nIt also follows Sutton being announced as the best place in London to bring up a family. The survey which looked at a number of factors, including access to good schools, named Sutton as one the top 20 best places to live in England and Wales.\nThe top 10 local authorities with the best GCSE results – percentage of pupils achieving five or more A*-C grades including English and mathematics – are:\nSutton 74.4%\nKensington and Chelsea 72.2%\nHammersmith and Fulham 70.8%\nKingston 70.4%\nBuckinghamshire 69.4%\nIsles of Scilly 68.4%\nRedbridge 68.1%\nSlough 67.7%\nBarnet 67.5%\nWokingham 67.4%\nRESIDENTS GIVE THE SMALL BLUE A HELPING HAND\nMore than 150 residents of our Ward joined forces on 25 June at a special event to help save one of the UK’s rarest butterflies.\nThe Butterfly Watch, at Devonshire Avenue Nature Area in Devonshire Avenue, was part of a series of measures to aid the small blue butterfly, which lives in just seven locations in London – three of which are in Sutton.\nResidents learnt how different butterflies use the reserve, while children joined in with face painting, nature trails, and craft activities to build a butterfly. Devonshire School’s Parent Teacher Association kept everyone fuelled with cold drinks and home made scones, whilst watching their children have a lot of fun.\nSutton’s Biodiversity Team showed residents how the butterfly survives on kidney vetch, the plant which provides the caterpillar with its food and habitat.\nKidney vetch thrives in Sutton’s chalky, alkaline soil, and Sutton Nature Conservation Volunteers took the names of people and organisations who want to grow the plant in their gardens and allotments to increase the available habitat and provide stepping stones for the butterfly to colonise further areas.\nHere, the Council’s Biodiversity Officer, Jurk Hendryk, explains what the butterflies need to survive.\nCouncillor Heather Honour said: “This event was part of a wider scheme to improve the site, which provides an important green space in an area of our borough which has fewer back gardens. I am so pleased that many different parts of our local community are involved in this project, from Christchurch in the neighbouring road, to the South Sutton Neighbourhood Association (SSNA). For many of the children, it was the first time they had ever been on a nature trail, and they loved it! Fun and learning, what better way to spend a Saturday afternoon?”\nThe SSNA has put in a bid for external funds to improve the area and provide a small play facility so local children have somewhere local to play.\nSmall blue butterflies were identified in the late afternoon and there is currently (July) a good display of kidney vetch at the nature area. There will be a demonstration of how to grow it and distribution of seeds later, in early September.\nColin Hall, Executive Member for Environment and Climate Change on Sutton Council, said: “The information day was all about telling residents how to give the butterfly a helping hand by growing the plants that it needs to survive – it’s a great example of the community coming together and boosting biodiversity in its own back yard.”\nFor any enquiries about getting involved with the project contact Councillor Honour on heather.honour@sutton.org.uk or for information about the site or small blue butterfly, please call the Biodiversity Team on 020 8770 5821 or email: biodiversity@sutton.gov.uk.\n[ Devonshire Avenue Nature Area ]\nEXPANDING POPULAR LOCAL SCHOOLS\nHeather and Richard visiting Devonshire Avenue school\nEXPANDING POPULAR LOCAL SCHOOLS\nSutton Council has taken an important decision to expand D\nThis is good news for parents of young children in Sutton South ward, as more Sutton South parents will be able to get their children into these popular and often oversubscribed schools. Heather and Richard have met the headteachers of both schools to discuss the consequences for local people and the management of the process, recognising the concerns of some parents at Barrow Hedges about possible detrimental effects, such as on parking.\nBoth headteachers have assured us that they see benefits for the schools from the expansion.\nBarrow Hedges school usually has about 300 applications for places each year – more applicants are turned away than get in to the school. Up to 2008 Barrow Hedges school had an intake of 60 children per year. Since then it has been 90 and the proposal is to stick to this number. When only 60 children were admitted you usually had to live within 600 metres of the school to get in, so only parents in a few roads at the east end of Sutton South ward could get their children into this school. The expansion will mean more Sutton South children get into the school.\nMore parents in Sutton South Ward send their children to Devonshire Avenue school, and the expansion of this school, with associated improvements to its facilities, is also to be welcomed.\nThis is good news for Sutton South.",

The third round of consultation was on a proposal developed from the results of the first two consultations, for a Permit Parking Area in roads in our Ward east of Langley Park Road.\nWHAT HAPPENED IN THE EARLIER ROUNDS OF CONSULTATION\nAs parking is often raised as a problem in the regular surveys of residents on what they like about living in Sutton, the Council asked residents if parking was a problem in their road and what they would like done. Earlier rounds of consultation led to proposals that were not given sufficient support by residents for the Council to proceed with them.\nThere were concerns that unless the controls cover the whole local area parking will be displaced into roads without controls, and “free to park at any time” bays would be a magnet for commuters and long stay parkers, squeezing out residents. The alternative to schemes that have these disadvantages is a residents-only Permit Parking Area (PPA).\nTHE FINAL STAGE OF CONSULTATION\nConsequently, the Council consulted residents at the end of 2019 on a proposed PPA. As roads not within the scheme will suffer from displaced parking if the roads nearby are in the scheme, the area consulted on was wide, running from Egmont Road to Willis Avenue and Prior Avenue – including Chalgrove Road, The Ridgway, Mayfield Road, Farm Road, Farm Close, Upland Road, Kayemoor Road, Downside Road, Willis Avenue and Prior Avenue.\nThe results of the consultation are clear – in every one of the roads listed above a majority of those expressing a view on the proposals supported their introduction. In some roads – particularly Chalgrove, Mayfield, The Ridgway, Upland – this was by a large margin. In all these roads more than one in four residents responded to the study, a high response rate for such local consultation exercises, and opinion was more than two to one in support of the proposed parking controls. In other roads consulted there was a lower response rate but still majorities in favour of the proposals. Once a scheme is introduced, any individual road left out will suffer high levels of parking, so any scheme needs to cover the whole area. It is a clear result that gives the Council a mandate to proceed with the introduction of the PPA consulted on.\nThe way the PPA works is that only residents can park their vehicles in the road for a “control period”, 9 to 11 AM each day on weekdays, thus removing commuters and long stay parkers. Residents who need to park a car on the road rather than in their drive during the “control period” will need to obtain a parking permit to display on the vehicle, and many residents will want to obtain “visitors’ permits” for their visitors if the visitors need to park in the street during the control period. There are special arrangements for carers. As this scheme will involve some costs of administration and enforcement there will be a charge for a permit, to cover costs, though all residents can get an initial supply of visitors’ permits without charge. The Council can cover costs but not use parking charges to subsidise other services. Parking charges in Sutton are amongst the lowest of any London borough. Charges per vehicle are on a scale you can find on the Council website and start at £40. A similar charge in Croydon is £80, Merton and Kingston £90, Richmond £99. You only need a permit if you need to park a car in the road during the “control period.” A PPA involves notices to advise motorists of the parking controls but there is no need for yellow lines.\nResidents will receive a letter from the Council which will set out the timetable for introducing the scheme, later this year, and how to obtain permits.\nMany residents are concerned about parking and we are pleased they have now had the opportunity to put their view on a concrete proposal developed on the basis of consultation, and a clear outcome has emerged.\nSPEEDING AND POLLUTION\nWe are concerned that the removal of parking from the area will lead to clear roads that will attract more traffic and speeding. In many parts of London, though often more affluent areas, residents have campaigned to get the traffic out of otherwise quiet residential streets and onto the main roads by turning roads into cul-de-sacs, thus creating quiet roads with better air quality and no through traffic. A good example locally is the gate at the end of Dorset Road which makes Homeland Drive a quiet, traffic free road. We are interested in the proposals residents have been putting to us for consultation on such traffic initiatives in our area. Nothing is currently proposed but, as traffic continues to increase, this is the next issue we need to look at. Do let us know your views.",

We will continue to promote this campaign.\nOur latest proposal is that we will be preparing a bid under TfL’s “Major Schemes Funding”, for this scheme. The bids are required to be submitted to TfL in September, so we have started work on it and Council Leader Ruth Dombey wrote to Boris Johnson on 29 May to seek his support. We will consult with stakeholders as appropriate. The bid will be for a wider scheme to improve the area around the station, a “Major Scheme” bid. Opening up and staffing the station side entrance is a matter for Southern Rail so the Council will need to enter into an agreement with them to open it up. They agreed to this ‘in principle’ during the Outer London Fund bid preparation, when the Council submitted a well-researched bid for funding under the Mayor’s Outer London Fund to facilitate the opening of the side entrance at the station.\nOpening the side entrance would be of benefit to the many commuters and other travellers who live in South Sutton Ward, who could enter and leave the station by this entrance, leading directly into The Quadrant. A page on this site (“Ward Map”) leads you to a map of the Ward, which shows the importance of opening this entrance. As rail travellers pass through the side entrance they would cross the boundary into Sutton South Ward.\nAs Sutton South Ward Councillors we strongly support this bid, as the outcome would be of benefit to our residents.\nThe Council wants to improve the “Gateway” into Sutton and the experience of those arriving in Sutton. Hence it wishes to improve Sutton station. The station is an important focal point for the town centre and the first impression that many visitors have of Sutton. It has been identified byTransport for London as a station that suffers from congestion problems due to its limited capacity in terms of the front entrance hall and ticket barriers. The Council continues to hope, in partnership with Southern Rail, to open the side entrance to the station for passenger use. In the longer term a more comprehensive re-development of the station is hoped for to expand and modernise passenger facilities and and enhance this important gateway and transport interchange.\nThe side entrance at Sutton station would cater for the considerable demand for direct access to the station from the Quadrant House office block, which houses Reed Business Information (which has approximately 2 000 employess, many of whom travel to work by train) and a number of other companies. This office block and those who work there are an important contributor to the economic vitality of Sutton. Reed Business Information fully supported the bid. The new side entrance would also serve the station car park, motor cycle and cycle parking areas, which generate considerable demand for access from that side of the station. It would also serve all the residents of Sutton South Ward who approach the station via Wellesley Road from the Langley Park Road direction.\nOpening up the side entrance, which physically is already there, requires the installation of automatic ticket barriers with Oyster readers, a new ticket machine, associated lighting, signing, communication improvements and CCTV improvements. Staffing costs would be met by Southern Rail. It is accepted that the side entrance would probably not be open all day, but using the entrance could ease the congestion at the station if open during peak hours in the morning and evening.\nDespite this strong case, the Mayor refused to support the earlier Outer London Fund bid, although accepting other aspects of the Council’s bid for funding under that scheme. We are not giving up and are taking forward this further “Major Schemes Funding” option. Let us hope for eventual success, as this development will be of value to the residents of Sutton South Ward.",

We have obtained, from schemes established by the Government and the London Mayor to deal with the aftermath of the pandemic, funding for plans to maintain these advances. The schemes are trials and will be monitored throughout the initial six months. Normally the Council would consult extensively before their introduction but the offer of funding is for immediate action following emergence from lockdown, so the measures will be introduced and monitored to assess resident reaction and their impact. The principal proposals include, in our Ward:\n* The Permit Parking Area (PPA) planned for roads from Mayfield Road running east as far as Banstead Road South, which residents strongly supported in consultation exercises, will be introduced from 30 November. This should reduce traffic and parking in this area\n* An extension of the 20 mph speed limit area in Langley Park Road to roads to the east, as far as Banstead Road South, has been introduced. This includes the part of the Ward where a PPA is to be introduced, so the reduced parking will lead to speeding, which has to be dealt with to maintain the peace and quiet of these residential roads\n* An experimental “modal filter” (allowing cyclists and pedestrians to cross but not other vehicles) to reduce traffic rat running north to south through the area, at Kings Lane, has been introduced. This will be subject to assessment after introduction and maintained if there is resident support. The impact on traffic in Langley Park Road and other local roads will be monitored. A proposal for a second filter, in Langley Park Road, remains in the programme but will not be implemented while Sutton Court Road is closed at the west end, and will be subject to review in the light of an assessment of the impact on traffic in the area from the Kings Lane filter\n* A“school street” at Overton Grange school to deal with traffic at the school gates has been implemented, closing the road where the school is situated to traffic when school students are arriving and leaving, so they can do so in safety and quiet. This involves the closure of Stanley Road south of the junction with Camborne Road when Overton Grange students are arriving and leaving.\nThese improvements will help maintain the peace of the quiet residential roads in our Ward, improve air quality, make the area more pleasant for walking and cycling, and benefit the neighbourhood. We hope to create a neighbourhood with less noise, less non-residential traffic, less speeding, cleaner air and a safer and more pleasant environment, promoting walking and cycling.\nThe proposals also respond to the many of the concerns raised by residents in the survey last year supporting the Council’s Liveable Neighbourhoods bid to the Mayor of London. These were:\n1. Too much rat-running traffic\n2. A wish for more trees, plants, greenery\n3. A need for improvement to air-quality\n4. A need for slower vehicle speeds on residential roads\n5. More pedestrian crossings on main roads\n6. More welcoming streets for walking\n7. More welcoming streets for cycling\nWe will be monitoring closely the impact of these measures and traffic levels were monitored in local streets in August. Normally the Council would consult extensively before their introduction but the offer of funding is for immediate action following emergence from lockdown, so the measures will be introduced and monitored to assess resident reaction and their impact. If, after the initial experimental six month period, the Council was minded to retain the schemes on a permanent basis there would be full resident consultation on a traffic management order.\nOn the criteria for evaluation of the temporary schemes, this is what TfL are asking us to use.\nWe will look at a range of factors when considering whether or not to make a temporary scheme permanent. These include the:\n- Effects the scheme has had and could continue to have on road safety and pedestrian overcrowding\n- Number of cyclists and pedestrians who have used each scheme\n- Contribution each scheme makes to the look and feel of the local area\n- Impact of the scheme on traffic, including the bus network\n- Feedback from the public and other stakeholders\n- Impact of the scheme on people protected under the Equality Act 2010\nBy way of background, the Low Traffic Neighbourhoods scheme was set up by the Conservative Government in consultation with the Labour London Mayor. A total of 859 schemes are being trialled across London for six months from September, and the rules for these schemes were set up by Central Government at very short notice. The Government asked for bids from every London Borough in mid May that had to be made within just a month, by 22nd June, which is not ideal.\nThe choice of areas was based on past requests to Local Committees, suggestions made by residents, and proposals previously made under the Transport for London (TfL) Liveable Neighbourhoods bid.\nThe Department for Transport advise that the six months long trials of the temporary schemes will enable further consultation if it is intended to make any of the schemes permanent. The benefit of a trial is that one can see if a scheme works or does not work, or can be improved. Where these schemes have been set up elsewhere in London they have often proved popular with residents.\nIn normal non- Covid times, we would have expected longer notice of bidding for schemes to allow for public consultation but the Government did not allow the usual process (which normally takes some months), on this occasion, as the timescale was telescoped into a very short one, of one month only.",
  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_page_7/content_367.html": "On Remembrance Sunday, November 8, Trish – our Mayor – led the brief service at the war memorial at Carshalton ponds, to remember the fallen. Due to the COVID restrictions, the traditional service was kept very brief this year.\nRichard attended the service and laid a wreath.\nSadly, the event normally held in Manor Park, at which Richard played the Last Post last year, was called off due to the COVID restrictions.\nEvery year, in the autumn, residents contact us to enquire about the leaf clearing programme. Each year the Council has a leaf clearing programme in place, where a team is deployed to all roads/streets that suffer from significant leaf fall. No Council can keep every road entirely free of leaves during the autumn leaf fall period, as resources are not unlimited. However, there is a programme that will, over a period, gradually clear away the fallen leaves.\nAs part of the South London Waste Partnership contract with Veolia, dedicated resources are provided for leafing, in support of the core street cleaning service. The operation is in two parts.\nFirst, throughout the borough leaves should be cleared by beat sweepers as they break down and start to lose their shape and structure. Gully grates should also be kept clear, by beat sweepers, to help minimise surface water runoff and drainage. Second, the dedicated Veolia team will work to clear leaves throughout the borough, aiming to ensure they do not become hazardous to road users and pedestrians, turning into detritus and blocking road-side gullies with danger of flooding. If there are particular streets that residents feel need to be addressed more urgently, we ask that this is done through the Report It function on the Council website.\nCommencement of the dedicated resource is a joint decision with Veolia and is based on the level of leaf fall and forecast weather conditions. The leaf fall programme is likely to start in the first week of November. There is an operational document that schedules which roads will be visited by the dedicated leafing team and when. As with all operational documents, and particularly with leafing, those involved have to be prepared to respond to weather conditions, to locations where demand and need is greatest, taking decisions on the basis of available resources. This means that the schedule is being constantly reviewed.\nIf residents or a community/resident group would like to get involved in clearing leaves from streets or communal areas please contact Council officers. Simply complete our Community Clean-Up Event Form with a few details. We can provide bags for use and will arrange for them to be collected from a pre-arranged location.\nLeaves from residents own property can be disposed through our paid for Garden Waste service or taken free of charge to the reuse and recycling centre at Kimpton Park Way, Sutton SM3 9QH. Alternatively, a garden composting bin could be used.\nResidents should not sweep leaves from their own property into the road.\nStudents returning to school at the start of the 2020 autumn term at Overton Grange enjoyed a quieter and safer atmosphere due to the introduction of a “school street” at the gates in Stanley Road at the time students arrived and left for the school day. This involved the closure of the part of Stanley Road adjacent to the school for a short period in the morning and afternoon, when the school day starts and ends.\nThe objectives of school streets are:\n1) To improve safety around the school at start and finish time\n2) To improve air quality for children outside their school gates (small people are particularly vulnerable to emissions from cars)\n3) To create a more welcoming atmosphere around the school, where children can walk in the road and parents can feel more relaxed.\nThe scheme was a six month trial funded by Transport for London, who set the parameters of the scheme. The scheme was withdrawn in advance of the conclusion of the six month trial following a legal challenge to the lawfulness of such schemes, but by then it was proposed to withdraw the scheme. This related to difficulties experienced in enforcing the traffic controls, which at successful “school street” schemes involved the participation of the school and parents.\nWhen Richard was first elected in 2010 one of the first projects he initiated was to get the “No Drinking Zone” in the centre of Sutton extended to our Ward. There were a group of what the police termed “all day drinkers” who used to congregate on Cedar Road outside Forest Dene Court.\nThe zone was extended to cover the area of our Ward south of the station as far as Cavendish Road, and running west to east from Brighton Road to Langley Park Road. In this area it is unlawful to continue to drink alcohol if asked by the police to stop, and there are provisions that would enable the police to confiscate alcohol. You will find reminders of the provisions attached to lampposts in the area, for example in Cedar Road.\nThe Council has, by law, to re-consider and consult afresh on these provisions from time to time. It is doing so at present. You can comment or make representations on the proposal to maintain these provisions. Representations must be made in writing and addressed to Safer Sutton Partnership Service, Environment, Housing and Regeneration Directorate, Sutton Police Station, 6 Carshalton Road, Sutton, SM1 4RF, before 21st September 2020. You need to state the grounds on which your representation or objection is made.\nIf you have any questions about this consultation, you can contact the Safer Sutton Partnership Team via email at safersutton@sutton.gov.uk.\nThe reduction in traffic in our residential roads at the height of the lockdown brought quiet, clean air, blue skies and a wish to preserve the pleasant environment it created. We have obtained, from schemes established by the Government and the London Mayor to deal with the aftermath of the pandemic, funding for plans to maintain these advances. The schemes are trials and will be monitored throughout the initial six months. Normally the Council would consult extensively before their introduction but the offer of funding is for immediate action following emergence from lockdown, so the measures will be introduced and monitored to assess resident reaction and their impact. The principal proposals include, in our Ward:\n* The Permit Parking Area (PPA) planned for roads from Mayfield Road running east as far as Banstead Road South, which residents strongly supported in consultation exercises, will be introduced from 30 November. This should reduce traffic and parking in this area\n* An extension of the 20 mph speed limit area in Langley Park Road to roads to the east, as far as Banstead Road South, has been introduced. This includes the part of the Ward where a PPA is to be introduced, so the reduced parking will lead to speeding, which has to be dealt with to maintain the peace and quiet of these residential roads\n* An experimental “modal filter” (allowing cyclists and pedestrians to cross but not other vehicles) to reduce traffic rat running north to south through the area, at Kings Lane, has been introduced. This will be subject to assessment after introduction and maintained if there is resident support. The impact on traffic in Langley Park Road and other local roads will be monitored. A proposal for a second filter, in Langley Park Road, remains in the programme but will not be implemented while Sutton Court Road is closed at the west end, and will be subject to review in the light of an assessment of the impact on traffic in the area from the Kings Lane filter\n* A“school street” at Overton Grange school to deal with traffic at the school gates has been implemented, closing the road where the school is situated to traffic when school students are arriving and leaving, so they can do so in safety and quiet. This involves the closure of Stanley Road south of the junction with Camborne Road when Overton Grange students are arriving and leaving.\nThese improvements will help maintain the peace of the quiet residential roads in our Ward, improve air quality, make the area more pleasant for walking and cycling, and benefit the neighbourhood. We hope to create a neighbourhood with less noise, less non-residential traffic, less speeding, cleaner air and a safer and more pleasant environment, promoting walking and cycling.\nThe proposals also respond to the many of the concerns raised by residents in the survey last year supporting the Council’s Liveable Neighbourhoods bid to the Mayor of London.

The police attended to ensure social distancing was observed, which it was. Trish made an excellent and impassioned speech, as did her daughter Lauren. Lauren told us that the previous day she had submitted, as part of her University course, a dissertation on mental illness in prisons. A finding had been that BAME prisoners were much more likely to be affected. Councillor Dombey also spoke.\nThe renowned artist Lionel Stanhope has brightened up our Ward. The painting, on the railway bridge at Sutton station, is not easy to photograph, so what is shown below is a CGI of the artwork created before the painting was undertaken. What is above, is the painting.\nThe railway bridge at Sutton station has been brightened up with a painting by the renowned artist Lionel Stanhope, whose art has brightened up many railway stations. Stanhope completed the painting in four days starting on 26 May. Stanhope is regarded by many as a better and more important street artist than Banksy. We have been pleased to support this project which brings an attractive feature to add interest to the area.The façade of the railway bridge, as you come out of Sutton station and turn left,was a patchwork of various colours. The Council first tried to interest Network Rail in making the bridge look more attractive, over four years ago, during the “Sutton Gateway” project, which involved re-paving the area around the station and the installation of the clock opposite Sutton station. The artwork has been mainly funded by Network Rail, with a small contribution from Sutton Council. The parapet of the bridge required extensive cleaning and preparation before the painting commenced. Lionel Stanhope produced a design which incorporates the word “Sutton” in the typeface traditionally used by Southern railway, and a depiction of the historic Sutton locomotive. The locomotive “Sutton” came into the possession of the Council many years ago and is a 144 year old, 28 tonne, 26 feet, A1 class Terrier steam engine. It is currently with a heritage railway undertaking in Tunbridge Wells who have undertaken to restore it. The painting is an addition to an area becoming famous for its street art. Within two hundred yards you can find the remarkable statue “The Messenger”, located directly outside the entrance to Quadrant House in The Quadrant. The Messenger is a statue, a sculpture in bronze with very dark patination, completed by David Wynne in 1981, of a large horse and rider. It was a major commission for the sculptor, who died in 2014. It took four years to complete from his first idea and inspiration, on receipt of the brief – through roughing out, refining and casting in a foundry, to the final unveiling and installation. We are not including a photograph of the statue in this post due to the philistine attitude of the owners of Quadrant House, who do not cherish this artwork and have stuck a notice on the front of it about some aspect of building maintenance, thus disfiguring it. They have been unco-operative in the face of requests to remove the notice. Even more striking is the remarkable mural by the famous Spanish “street” artist from Bilbao, Eva Mena, on a wall in nearby Wellesley Road. This is said to be of the American singer and musician Erykah Badu. The work was commissioned by the owners of the building, Indepth Hygiene Services. It was painted in three days in 2010, when the artist came over from Spain to paint it. It is entirely typical of her street art, which is to be found on walls in many parts of the world, including Egypt, Ireland and Spain, as well as Sutton. Eva Mena is said to be more famous than Banky in her native Spain.\nThe Local Government Boundary Commission for England has been reviewing the boundaries of the local Government Wards in Sutton prior to the next local elections in 2022.\nThey published draft proposals last year and have now published final decisions. You can view these on their website.\nTheir final decisions leave the Ward much as it was, with the addition of a part of Mulgrave Road. The new structure they outline will be the structure of Wards at the next Council elections in 2022. The new Ward will be one of the largest Wards in the borough.\nCurrently the Ward runs from Sutton station in the north to Devonshire Road in the south, and Banstead Road South in the east to Overton Road in the west. It is mostly a Ward of residential roads with three schools (Devonshire Avenue primary, Overton Grange, Eagle House school), one small park (the Devonshire Avenue Nature Area), three places of worship (Christchurch, the Friends’ Meeting House, the synagogue in Cedar Road), split into three parts by Langley Park Road and Brighton Road running north-south.\nThe draft proposals published earlier this year removed from the Ward roads east of Upland Road – Kaymoor, Willis, Prior, Downside, Farm Close – and put them into Carshalton Beeches Ward. There were minor adjustments at the western end so the whole Ward moved westwards.\nIn drawing up new boundaries, the Commission is required to aim to deliver electoral equality for voters in Council elections so that each Councillor represents roughly the same number of voters. The review also aimed to ensure that the new Council wards reflect, as far as possible, the interests and identities of communities across Sutton.\nThe final proposals leave the Ward much as it was, with the addition of a small part of Mulgrave Road. The new Ward will be one of the largest Wards in the borough.\nAfter a debate on 14 October Sutton Council submitted some proposals. Richard spoke in this debate, commenting in particular on the proposals fro Sutton South Ward. He said:\n“I recognise that there is always a tension between drawing lines on maps that create sensible geographical structures in terms of communities and natural boundaries and getting the numbers right in terms of residents per Councillor. I would like to stress that where these create tensions I think it important to give priority to getting the boundaries right, creating areas that residents recognise as communities, in particular respecting natural boundaries such as main roads and railway lines, and keeping recognised communities together, and this should be the priority even if it does lead to some unevenness in Ward sizes. In any exercise like this there will inevitably be some disparity in the size of Wards with some outliers.”\nThe Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, advised by Historic England, has added to the National Heritage List for England the historic sewer pipe in Hillcroome Road.\nThis structure thus becomes the only structure in our Ward to be nationally listed as of historic and architectural significance, so it could only be altered or have work done on it if listed building consent was obtained. There are three other buildings in our Ward that are listed on the Local List of structures of local importance, which provides a lesser degree of protection. These are:\nthe Registrar’s office (The Russetings) in Worcester Road, a Victorian house that it is believed the Walls family, famous for Walls ice cream and Walls sausages, lived in, though this is disputed\nStowford in Brighton Road, a Victorian house, now the Eagle House school\nthe pavilion of the Highfield Lawns tennis club at the junction of Mayfield Road and The Ridgway, as an example of an Edwardian tennis pavilion, build by local builder Percy Vere Windebank in 1908\nThese Drain Pressure Release Pipes, also known as ‘Stink Pipes’, can be seen at various locations within the old Carshalton Urban District Council boundary. They have been listed on the basis of the criterion that they are important to the townscape view.\nThey were produced by W. Macfarlane & Co. of Glasgow, a prestigous Victorian Ironworks. The company employed imaginative designers and produced huge amounts of ornate and decorative ironwork. The pipes are extremely tall with an ornate top fixture comprising a large arrow, a globe with four trumpetlike funnels and a spike spire piercing a crown. The height and funnels may be to ensure the gas disperses efficiently so as not to inconvenience local residents. It is not known what purpose the arrow has, whether to indicate the direction of sewer flow or act as a weather vane to indicate wind direction.\nThey serve two purposes, firstly to prevent a build up of pressure in underground sewers in the event of a blockage, and secondly to vent off any hydrogen sulphide gas. This gas, which smells of rotten eggs, can build up when sewage becomes septic, on long runs, or when the speed of the sewage is slow in flat areas. It is extremely corrosive and can eat through the concrete pipes. The sewerage system would have become a necessity after the rapid increases in population and residences in Sutton and Carshalton at the end of the 1800s. Prior to this sewage would have been dispersed into cesspits and drainage ditches, with a risk of contamination of the drinking water supply, contributing to ill health.\nThe history of W. Macfarlane and Co. and their foundry, the Saracen Foundry, is fascinating. In 1851 Walter Macfarlane (1817-1885) established his company in a disused foundry in Saracen Lane in Gallowgate, Glasgow, and named it Saracen Foundry. It later moved to Washington Street, near the River Clyde. By 1872 his nephew, also named Walter MacFarlane (1853–1932), joined the rapidly expanding company and they relocated to Possilpark, a site of 100 acres on the outskirts of the city. Here a foundry with railway access and a village-styled infrastructure to house the workforce was built. In a decade it housed 10,000 people but the vast iron-founding site caused much pollution. The young MacFarlane made standardisation and good design the key to the company’s successful development. The foundry’s work was used on prestigous developments and widely distributed. During the Second World War Possilpark industrial works was a vast and well-lit target for attack. The recovery of iron to melt down for the war effort also removed much of Saracen’s work. After the war, the collapse of the British Empire, the move away from steam power and the use of new designs and materials led to a vast decline in orders. In 1967 the foundry at Possilpark closed.\nOne of the ways to combat global warming is to plant more trees. Richard and Trish have been responsible for getting the Council to plant many trees in our Ward, some to replace trees that were lost to disease but many new trees. Trees absorb carbon dioxide and pollution, and pump out oxygen. Sutton is amongst the leaders among the 32 London boroughs in the number of street trees per yard of pavement. This contributes to the pleasant, green, suburban atmosphere of the area we all so much enjoy, though it creates a headache every autumn when the leaves fall.\nThis planting activity has included trees in:\nUpland Road – outside 18, 20, 39. 103\nCamborne Road – outside 47/49, 32/34\nEffingham Close – 17, 26\nLangley Park Road – opposite 91 Egmont\nDevonshire Road – outside the school\nThe Ridgway – 18, 59\nChristchurch Park – one outside, and one opposite, White Lodge Close.",

Thank you. We now want to build up Lib Dem support in the ward and increase our number of councillors to three next time. It is very important that we keep our Ward members in touch with what we are both doing and find out what you think we can all do to make Sutton South an even better place to live in. Being a Councillor is not a job for slouches! The few paragraphs below give you a sample of what’s been going on.\nPolice\nAlthough crime is statistically low in our area, on a number of occasions we have met local police from the Sutton South Safer Neighbourhood Team to discuss what to do about the drug dealing that has been taking place outside some blocks of flats; “street drinkers” congregating near Forest Dene on Cedar Road, and about serious instances of anti social behaviour affecting a number of residents in social housing. Some significant proposals are under discussion. We are of course in touch with our local Neighbourhood Watch scheme.\nPlanning\nRichard is becoming something of a planning expert! He has spoken several times at the Development Control Committee on planning applications that have worried residents, and attended Planning Inspectorate hearings on appeals concerning planning decisions affecting the Ward. One concerned a nursing home in Mayfield Road, where the owner breached planning conditions. Another concerned the prospect of additional noise and disturbance for residents of Grosvenor Court in the Brighton Road from a proposed pizza takeaway which planned to use six motorbikes to deliver pizzas.\nOpen Spaces\nAlthough Sutton is renowned for its delightful green open spaces, there is only one such area in Sutton South, the nature reserve in Devonshire Road. After we discovered that 50 per cent of children in Devonshire School do not have the use of a garden, we’ve been working to improve this area, but without detracting from its purpose and basic informal character.\nIn collaboration with LibDem Councillors in Carshalton Central we are forming a Friends of Warren Park group, a much loved park on the borders of this ward. Do let us know if you are interested in being involved.\nLocal Schools\nWe have been talking to residents and head teachers about the Council’s proposals to increase the intake and expand the buildings at both Devonshire and Barrow Hedges Primary Schools. Expansion is needed because the number of young children has increased in the borough. Both Head Teachers support the proposals and see them improving standards. It should now become easier for our local parents to get their children into these popular and successful schools. But we will be watching to make sure that the expansions are well managed, to meet the concerns of some parents at Barrow Hedges about issues such as parking.\nWe visited Overton Grange School to discuss road safety concerns with the Head Master. Following this visit council officials have come forward with proposed improvements, which we support.\nRubbish etc\nRubbish remains a problem. Some local residents are vigilant in tackling this unhealthy and unpleasant eye sore. We have been addressing the issue of rubbish at the side of Sutherland House and Richard as dealt with problems about rubbish disposal at Grosvenor Court.\nOther issues we have taken up include blocked drains, potholes, grit bins, noise in flats, the pruning of trees and replacing trees damaged by cars in Copse Hill.\nSutton Housing Partnership\nWith staff from Sutton Housing Partnership, we have visited a number of properties that they manage in this ward to identify necessary remedial work to the buildings. More visits are planned. We believe that our concern about the state of the ball court at Sutton Court has revived plans for its improvement, which are now being pursued.\nMeetings, Meetings and More Meetings!\nAside from this, we are both members of several Council committees, including the Health and Wellbeing Scrutiny Committee, the Health and Safety Committee (which Richard chairs) and the Audit Committee. Heather is a member of the Smarter Sutton Services Steering Group, looking at strategies to transform planned expenditure reductions into an opportunity to improve efficiency and services. She has already made her maiden speech at a Council meeting\nLocal Action\nWe both sit on the Sutton South, Belmont and Cheam Local Committee. This has previously been entirely Conservative controlled. Most residents are unaware of the committee which provides small amounts of funding for local capital projects. We need to make this committee work better. Please come and take part.",

This is a concern Richard and Trish share – on 8 October Trish attended a service in St Paul’s Cathedral to express our detestation of the racist hate crimes that followed the Brexit vote.\nRichard was making a speech closing Black History Month, which he had opened at an event at the start of October, and he repeated themes he had raised the previous day when addressing the Annual General Meeting of Sutton’s Afro-Caribbean Heritage Association.\nWhile drawing attention to positive developments in the promotion of diversity and multiculturalism he said he had been shocked by the racist hate crimes that followed the Brexit vote, and hoped this was a phase we would quickly move on from.\nThe Mayor said:\n“Each year October is Black History Month, focused on raising the awareness of African and Caribbean history and cultural heritage, and celebrating the positive contribution of this heritage to the political, economic and cultural life of Britain.\nMy own family has a great interest in black history, in diversity and multiculturalism. Our daughter is married to man whose family comes from Ghana, so we have a grandson who is of mixed race. I look forward to having long, deep and meaningful discussions with him about diversity and multiculturalism, and what he can draw from a heritage that is both British and African. But he is only one year old, so not yet.\nFirst celebrated in the UK in 1987, Black History Month is marked annually as an important point of reference for the black community. I believe we have made progress in the UK over recent decades in tackling racist attitudes, increasing diversity, and improving equality, within Sutton and in Britain as a whole. I tell my daughter and my son-in-law that when I was growing up in the 1950s and 1960s in this country, her marriage, a white woman marrying a black African man, would have been unusual and provoked openly racist comment in the white community.\nToday, where she lives in Brixton, it is quite usual, and when I take my grandson to play groups there, such as the one I took him to in Brockwell Park last Monday, I cannot help but notice what an enormous melting pot there is of children of many different colours and racial groups, and many variation of mixed race, playing happily together. It makes me optimistic about the prospects for further progress in building a diverse community, something that is re-enforced every week when I represent the community, as Mayor, at Citizenship ceremonies, where people of many different cultural backgrounds take British citizenship.\nFor that reason I have been shocked, we have all been shocked, by the racist attacks and hate crimes following the Brexit vote, and we must pray that this is a phase we will, as a community, quickly recover from.\nSutton’s Black History Group was established in 2010 and has promoted a wide range of free community-wide events. The Group has been strongly supported by Sutton Council which is why I, the Mayoress and the Deputy Mayor Councillor Patel are here today, to show that support.”",

The Council has won on both counts.\nThere is a history of planning difficulties with this site, with three different extensions being the subject, at different times, of appeals to the Planning Inspectorate against Council decisions.\nThis application sought the retention of an outhouse built in a garden at the north end of the site, without planning permission, which had already been the subject of earlier appeals that had been lost.\nUnusually, not only did the Planning Inspector dismiss the appeal but made an award of costs.

He says in the judgement:\n“For these reasons, I therefore find that unreasonable behaviour resulting in unnecessary or wasted expense, as described in Circular 03/2009, has been demonstrated and that a full award of Costs is justified.”\nRichard has attended previous appeal hearings relating to this property. He says “I am not surprised at the view the Inspector took. This appeal was never likely to succeed. I have tried to assist in sorting out the planning problems the applicant faces by arranging meetings between him and local residents. I hope he will now take the necessary action to resolve the remaining planning issues.”\nThe Inspector says “The proposal would cause harm to the living conditions of the residents of the adjoining property by reason of its overbearing nature contrary to DPD Policy DM2 and the Framework, which aims to protect amenity by ensuring no adverse affect (sic) on the amenities of the occupiers of adjoining properties.” The Inspector also makes reference to the importance of the Area of Special Local Character.",

This was after the meeting of the consultative panel for our Ward arranged for Wednesday 14 March was called off due a shortage of available police personnel.\nWe both sit on the panel, which is a vehicle for consultation with the community about police priorities and is also a mechanism for the community to help the police. More information about the panel is available on the page on “Sutton Police”.\nThe text of our letter to Sutton’s senior police officers was as follows:\n“To Superintendant Phil Willis, Head of SPSS\nChief Inspector Alan Chambers\nDear Colleagues\nThe scheduled police consultative panel meeting that was due to take place tonight in Sutton South Ward of the London Borough of Sutton has been postponed by the police.\nCouncillor Heather Honour and I, the two Liberal Democrat Councillors for the Ward, are concerned at this cancellation, which appears to be due to problems related to police resources. I am writing to you to express our concern and to seek re-assurance that there are not going to be longer term problems with the policing of our Ward.\nThe Sutton South Ward Safer Neighbourhoods policing team used to have its own sergeant. Last year that was taken away from us, when the long-serving Dave Williams retired, and a single segeant was appointed to cover both Belmont and Sutton South. We did not protest at this, since analysis we regularly carry out of crime trends in Sutton South compared to the rest of the Borough show it is a low crime area, and Belmont Ward has similarly low figures. Sergeant Brendan Mcwilliams was appointed.\nSince then there has been a continuous pattern of change. Sergeant McWilliams is now leaving us and we find that the resources of the team are almost continuously depleted by training and by officers being deployed away from the area to help with operations elsewhere. This depletion is the reason we have been given as to why it is not possible to hold the scheduled meeting of the panel thisevening.\nWe fully appreciate that there are times when local resources have to be offered up to assist in wider policing exercises, and recognise that as the Olympics approach this may happen more often. However, we would be concerned if our area was left with so little cover that normal policing tasks for the community were put at risk, and if this were to impact on crime levels.\nWe would welcome your reaction to these concerns and trust you can put our minds at rest.\nBest wishes.\nRichard Clifton\nCouncillor for Sutton South Ward”",

NHS Sutton Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) now propose to move the surgery to a health centre in Robin Hood Lane in central Sutton, closer to the current practice. This is a proposal currently being worked up. It is also proposed to move the Mulgrave Road surgery, which many local residents use, to this site. The full list of surgeries that might move to the site is:\n- Grove Road practice\n- Mulgrave road surgery\n- Benhill surgery (part of Benhill and Belmont GP centre)\nIn addition, Dr Grice and partners branch surgery is already at the site (though not their main surgery at the Old Court House) and Dr Seyan and partners are already at the site. If you are registered with any of these practices you should have received a letter from the CCG inviting views on the proposal.\nThe Grove Road practice does need to move. It is currently in a converted house so some surgery rooms are upstairs, with no lift, and it is not possible to have a private conversation with reception staff as the reception is in the hallway of the house. It does not meet modern standards and NHS England will require it to move. But there are few sites available in Sutton.

The third round of consultation was on a proposal developed from the results of the first two consultations, for a Permit Parking Area in roads in our Ward east of Langley Park Road.\nWHAT HAPPENED IN THE EARLIER ROUNDS OF CONSULTATION\nAs parking is often raised as a problem in the regular surveys of residents on what they like about living in Sutton, the Council asked residents if parking was a problem in their road and what they would like done. Earlier rounds of consultation led to proposals that were not given sufficient support by residents for the Council to proceed with them.\nThere were concerns that unless the controls cover the whole local area parking will be displaced into roads without controls, and “free to park at any time” bays would be a magnet for commuters and long stay parkers, squeezing out residents. The alternative to schemes that have these disadvantages is a residents-only Permit Parking Area (PPA).\nTHE FINAL STAGE OF CONSULTATION\nConsequently, the Council consulted residents at the end of 2019 on a proposed PPA. As roads not within the scheme will suffer from displaced parking if the roads nearby are in the scheme, the area consulted on was wide, running from Egmont Road to Willis Avenue and Prior Avenue – including Chalgrove Road, The Ridgway, Mayfield Road, Farm Road, Farm Close, Upland Road, Kayemoor Road, Downside Road, Willis Avenue and Prior Avenue.\nThe results of the consultation are clear – in every one of the roads listed above a majority of those expressing a view on the proposals supported their introduction. In some roads – particularly Chalgrove, Mayfield, The Ridgway, Upland – this was by a large margin. In all these roads more than one in four residents responded to the study, a high response rate for such local consultation exercises, and opinion was more than two to one in support of the proposed parking controls. In other roads consulted there was a lower response rate but still majorities in favour of the proposals. Once a scheme is introduced, any individual road left out will suffer high levels of parking, so any scheme needs to cover the whole area. It is a clear result that gives the Council a mandate to proceed with the introduction of the PPA consulted on.\nThe way the PPA works is that only residents can park their vehicles in the road for a “control period”, 9 to 11 AM each day on weekdays, thus removing commuters and long stay parkers. Residents who need to park a car on the road rather than in their drive during the “control period” will need to obtain a parking permit to display on the vehicle, and many residents will want to obtain “visitors’ permits” for their visitors if the visitors need to park in the street during the control period. There are special arrangements for carers. As this scheme will involve some costs of administration and enforcement there will be a charge for a permit, to cover costs, though all residents can get an initial supply of visitors’ permits without charge. The Council can cover costs but not use parking charges to subsidise other services. Parking charges in Sutton are amongst the lowest of any London borough. Charges per vehicle are on a scale you can find on the Council website and start at £40. A similar charge in Croydon is £80, Merton and Kingston £90, Richmond £99. You only need a permit if you need to park a car in the road during the “control period.” A PPA involves notices to advise motorists of the parking controls but there is no need for yellow lines.\nResidents will receive a letter from the Council which will set out the timetable for introducing the scheme, later this year, and how to obtain permits.\nMany residents are concerned about parking and we are pleased they have now had the opportunity to put their view on a concrete proposal developed on the basis of consultation, and a clear outcome has emerged.\nSPEEDING AND POLLUTION\nWe are concerned that the removal of parking from the area will lead to clear roads that will attract more traffic and speeding. In many parts of London, though often more affluent areas, residents have campaigned to get the traffic out of otherwise quiet residential streets and onto the main roads by turning roads into cul-de-sacs, thus creating quiet roads with better air quality and no through traffic. A good example locally is the gate at the end of Dorset Road which makes Homeland Drive a quiet, traffic free road. We are interested in the proposals residents have been putting to us for consultation on such traffic initiatives in our area. Nothing is currently proposed but, as traffic continues to increase, this is the next issue we need to look at. Do let us know your views.",

The cost of the average house sold in February, the latest month for which reliable data are available, was £255 000. This bullishness in the housing market is generally taken as an indicator of confidence in the local economy.\nPositive indicators include:\nThe economic activity rate of working age adults in Sutton, at 81%, continues to be well above the average for London, which is 76%. Sutton residents continue to find work, and the percentage has increased (by 0.5%) in the last year. Many residents commute to central London for work, and it is unsurprising that the average pay of employees working in Sutton (£519 a week) is less than that in central London.\nThis finding, that Sutton residents continue to find work, is supported by the decline in numbers claiming Job Seekers Allowance, down by 7% in March compared to the figure for a year previously.\nThat said, the number of people who have been collecting JSA for over a year has risen in the last year, suggesting that those who have become distanced from the labour market are finding it more difficult to get work. Richard says this mirrors what he finds, as a local Councillor, in his casework, with people made redundant in their 50’s often finding it hard to get back into work.\nThis suggests that the Council’s “Opportunity Sutton” programme is an important priority. Jobs are gold dust and the prosperity of the Borough depends on people finding and staying in work.\nNew business start ups were at a record level in Sutton in 2012, with 863 new companies formed.\nThe number of local companies going into administration was down in the most recent quarter (January to March) and down on figures for a year previously.\nThe data that comes to the Housing, Economy and Business Committee usually shows a mixed picture, but the latest data are mostly encouraging. One negative that concerns us is that enquiries to Sutton’s Citizens’ Advice Bureau were up by about 5% in the last quarter, with debt advice enquiries increasing by 8.8%. Richard has said his piece, at Sutton Council meetings, about the problem of “payday” loans and we cannot see why it is impossible to have a maximum figure for the interest charged on these loans (it can be over 1000% APR) imposed in law. Richard’s comments are included in a separate post on this site on this subject.\nThis information is analysed by Richard in his role as vice-chair of the Council’s Housing, Economy and Business Committee, which has oversight of economic development matters and the “Opportunity Sutton” programme. This is currently generating projects involving over £90 million worth of investment in Sutton, including the “Sutton Gateway” project to develop and improve the area from Sutton Court to the station. We hope this will include improving and opening up the side entrance to Sutton station, better shops and restaurants, new jobs from office development, more housing as Sutherland House is developed, the relocation of the recycling bins at The Quadrant and a general tidying up of the area.",

Public transport isn’t currently an alternative in Sutton, it’s too expensive, too infrequent and too patchy throughout the borough.\nDon’t get me wrong, I live on a busy cut through road and would appreciate cleaner air and all the health benefits, but the effects on the quality of life and opportunities for me and my son are just too great. This will leave so many people like me without that extra help they need and rely on, they will find it harder to work, socialise and access healthcare and become even more isolated than before.\nSo you can see, this doesn’t just affect a small amount of vehicles as the Mayor of London claims in his now withdrawn advert, the knock on effect if this is brought in its current form will actually affect a much wider community of people whose lifelines will be cut. “",

These include that access to the roof should be via an external hoist with all materials for work on the roof transported to the roof by an external hoist and not brought up via the well of the building. The interior of the building should not be a storage area or building site. There should be a construction management plan to minimize disruption to existing residents and ensure there are controls on dust and noise, and on hours of work.

It can lead to family break up and people losing their jobs if they wind up in bed and breakfast accommodation far away. In the recession, there are many reasons why this may happen, in particular redundancy. Every effort should be made to keep people in their homes while efforts are made to find them other suitable accommodation they can move to.\nLandlords, sometimes because they are intent on jacking up rents, may try to remove tenants without going through a proper legal process. The policy of the Council is to insist the proper process is followed and to give those threatened with homelessness advice and support, trying to find them some other private sector accommodation. In most cases this is successful, but it is often quite late in the process that a solution is found.\nRichard argued that people should not be pressured into leaving their accommodation early in the legal process, if no alternative accommodation had been found. If they were pressured into leaving their accommodation two problems arose:\n– it reduces the time available to the Council’s support team to find them an alternative home, and an alternative was often found quite late in the process, meaning they would have to go into bed and breakfast\n– there was a danger that they might, in law, be deemed to have made themselves intentionally homeless, in which case what support the Council can provide is limited.\nRichard therefore supported a policy of avoiding putting pressure on people to leave their accommodation early in the legal process, and that the Council should only accept that someone is homeless and put them in B and B accommodation before the process is exhausted if and when it is fundamentally evident that no alternative accommodation will become available.",

Richard visited the event twice during the day and reports that the inflatable (bouncy castle) was one of the biggest he has seen. The biodiversity team were there with an interesting display and the police had a kick about on the ball court with local kids. A good time had by all despite a little rain.\nLook at Richard’s Blog for 17 August to discover some other interesting things he did on this day and the name of a film he saw that he particularly recommends.\nSUTHERLAND HOUSE – PLANNING INSPECTORATE SUPPORTS VIEW THAT AFFORDABLE HOMES ARE REQUIRED\nThe owners of Sutherland House will make sufficient profit when they re-develop Sutherland House as 160 luxury flats that they can and should include some “affordable homes” in the proposal.\nThis is the view of the Planning Inspector who has rejected the appeal by the owners of Sutherland House against the view taken by the Council and supported by Richard and Heather. The Inspector awarded the Council costs on the grounds of the unreasonable action of the developers.\nRichard and Heather have appealed to the developers to now get on with the re-development of the site taking on board the Inspector’s views – that we need some affordable housing and a better design for the units in Cedar Road.\nRichard spoke at the appeal hearing on 17 July.\nThe Council supported the re-development of Sutherland House as residential units but argued for some affordable housing and that the proposed development fronting on to Cedar Road included accommodation of a quality that was not acceptable. The Inspector supported the Council on both points. The Inspector accepted a financial analysis of the viability of the project that showed there was sufficient profit to make it possible to include some affordable housing.\nRichard says “The views of the Inspector accord exactly with the case I put to the hearing. I feel vindicated, in saying this proposal was not good enough. The developer will make a lot of money from turning this building, close to the town centre and Sutton station, into luxury flats. The appraisal accepted by the Inspector showed there can be some affordable housing included without threatening the financial viability of the project. As a Councillor, I meet local families living in extremely overcrowded conditions and we desperately need more affordable housing. The building has been empty too long and I call on the developer to now get on with it and come up with a scheme that reflects the Inspector’s decision.”\nNEW ACTION ON SPEEDING\nWe are pleased that we have been able to obtain funding from the Council to paint 20 mph “roundels” (see picture) at a number of locations within the 20mph speed restriction area in Sutton South Ward.\nThese locations include both ends of Cumnor Road, the east end of Cavendish Road, and the junction of Langley Park Road and Cedar Road. There are also “reminder” signs in Cavendish Road and Cedar Road some way along the road.\nThe law used to say the roundels could only be at the entry point to the speed limit zone. A recent change in the law means the roundels can now be displayed within the zone to re-enforce the message.\nWe hope this will contribute to a reduction in speeding in the Ward.\nCOUNCIL’S WAR ON PAYDAY LENDERS CONTINUES\nPayday lenders have been frozen out by the Borough. Access to their websites has been blocked on all council computers.\nAccess to over 170 sites – such as Wonga.com and 247cashline.com – have been barred from all Council PCs, including those in public spaces like libraries. The move aims to help protect local people from the quick cash companies and avoid sky high interest rates.\nRichard welcomed the move, calling again for new controls on payday loan companies.\nHe pointed out that figures released as part of Sutton Council’s “Economy Watch – Economic Indicators” report show an alarming rise in debt enquiries from Sutton residents to the Citizens Advice Bureau. Richard said, in a letter to residents, “I am increasingly concerned that people are turning to these companies without looking into the real costs of borrowing money, which in some cases that I have investigated are well over 1000% APR.”\nSpeaking to the Council’s Housing, Economy and Business Committee about the latest data on Sutton’s economic performance, on 18 June, Richard pointed out that enquiries to Sutton’s Citizens Advice Bureau were up by about 5% in the last quarter with debt enquiries increasing by 8.8%. There has to be a fear that recent welfare cuts will make the position worse.\nIn a letter to residents he called for consideration to be given to establishing by law some upper limit on the interest rate that can be charged on loans.\nThe Leader of Sutton Council, Councillor Ruth Dombey, said: “Payday lenders prey on people who are at their most vulnerable and in need of quick financial assistance. Sometimes people don’t realise the trouble taking out one of these irresponsible loans can do for them in the long run. A small initial loan can lead to thousands of pounds of debt and an irreversible downward spiral.\n“This is a small yet significant step towards protecting local people from these companies. I’d urge anyone who needs advice to speak to their bank or the local credit union.”\nPeople who live, work or study in Croydon, Merton or Sutton can start saving at the CMS Credit Union. Credit unions are savings and loans co-operative businesses that are committed to promoting saving rather than borrowing. Anyone who saves with a credit union becomes a member. The members’ savings are pooled to form a sum of money from which members can borrow at those times when they need to.\nFor more information about CMS Credit Union click on this link.\nLOLLIPOP PEOPLE SAFE IN SUTTON\nWe have recently received a number of letters from residents, as part of a national campaign, raising concerns regarding road safety and lollipop ladies and men.\nSutton has a very good record on this subject.\nIn Sutton we currently have 13 School Crossing Patrol Officers employed at 12 sites in the Borough. One of these is a job share which is vacant but we plan to recruit in time for the start of term in September. We have no plans to reduce or stop any of our patrols. Only one post has been lost in recent years, at St Dunstan’s school when Transport For London installed a Pelican crossing at the site.\nSutton Council has been very pro-active in seeking funds for school crossings from Transport for London (TFL) at a number of sites in the Borough. Bids are made once a year for TFL funding for road schemes by Councillors in discussion with community representatives and residents, and these include road safety projects.\nIn fact Sutton’s roads were recently acknowledged as being the safest in London in a report that examined accident rates, casualties and road conditions. The report identified that drivers in Sutton have 4 accidents per 1,000 vehicles, which is well below the Greater London average of 8.1.\nHowever, even this low number of casualties is too many and we are working with TFL to make our roads safer for everyone.\nThe Council is about to publish a Road Safety Guide for Parents, covering many aspects of Road Safety including information on School Crossing Patrols, travelling to school, and roadside behaviour when walking, driving or cycling.”\nOur lollipop ladies and men provide an excellent service, keeping our roads safe and there are no plans to withdraw any posts in Sutton.\n“THE CHALLENGE” CHALLENGES RICHARD\nOn Saturday 3 August Richard took part in an event organised by “The Challenge” (website www.the-challenge.org ), a major charity involved in promoting social inclusion amongst young people, funded by the Cabinet Office.\nThe event involved teams of young people aged 16 to 18 developing and presenting projects to promote socially useful ideas. A panel assesses the proposals (this part based on the TV “Dragons’ Den” concept) and can award up to £80 to the team for them to undertake the project. Richard was one of the “Dragons”, forming a panel with Croydon MP Gavin Barwell and the HR Director of the Fairfield Halls.\nThe event took place at St. Andrew’s secondary school, at Warrington Road in Croydon.\nRichard says “The ideas put forward by these teams were so imaginative. Their projects were all socially useful, though not always entirely practical. But the enthusiasm was massive and the careful presentation of the projects, all of them based on research the teams had carried out, was impressive. One involved inviting people to paint on massive boards, to combat graffiti but also to produce an artwork. Another promoted a national “telling jokes” day, to cheer us all up, and another promoted strategies to get people on the Croydon tram to talk to each other, as they did during the Olympics.”\nAll the teams were awarded the funds they sought. This was not a “play” exercise – the teams will get the funding and take their ideas to completion.\nSOUTH SUTTON NEIGHBOURHOOD ASSOCIATION GARDEN PARTY\nOn Sunday 4 August the South Sutton Neighbourhood Association held its 2013 garden party, hosted by Richard and Gloria in their garden, in The Ridgway.\nRichard and Gloria have been members of the SSNA since moving to The Ridgway, exactly a quarter of a century ago this year. Heather is also a longstanding member, and was among those who came to the party.\nAbout 30 SSNA members came, and enjoyed cakes, tea, soft drinks or a glass of wine. Richard’s courgettes were much admired, though his runner beans are suffering badly from blackfly.\nSTAGGERING WORKLOAD INCREASE CHALLENGES CASE FOR CLOSURE\nA staggering increase in the workload of the St. Helier hospital Accident and Emergency Department, during the hot weather, has again challenged the case for closure of this important facility.\nThe hot weather has led to the busiest July in six years at St Helier and Epsom’s Accident and Emergency departments.\nThe threatened A&E departments saw an increase of 19 per cent – which is around 1,420 extra patients between July 1 and 22.\nOverall 8,917 patients were seen during that period compared to 7,496 in 2008.\nAn average of 405 patients came in to A&E each day and on July 15 a staggering 468 patients attended A&E.\nOur photo above shows Heather and Richard at St. Helier hospital protesting against the closure of the A & E and maternity departments.\nSTUDY CONFIRMS PARKING REVENUE IN SUTTON AMONGST LOWEST IN SOUTH LONDON\nA study by the RAC Foundation of the revenue Councils make from on-street parking permits, off-street parking charges and parking penalties in 2011-12 found that Sutton had the smallest net revenue of any London Borough Council in south London except Bexley.\nSutton ranked 92 in the listing produced by the Foundation. Bexley, ranked 93, was just below Sutton. All other London Boroughs in south London came above Sutton, with higher net revenue figures.\nThe study, based on annual returns to the Department of Communities and Local Government, examined gross figures for revenue offset against the cost of running parking operations (excluding capital costs).\nRichard said “While I have criticisms of the value of this study in terms of the way statistics are used, the study is consistent with something we already knew. Parking charges in Sutton are very reasonable to the motorist and to local residents.”",
  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_2013_01_10_promoting-choice-in-travel/content_688.html": "These “car club” cars have made an appearance on the streets of Sutton. They initially caused a stir as so many were in a few roads around Sutton station, but now they are more dispersed.\nThey offer an alternative to car clubs such as Zipcar, where the car has to be returned to a specified point, as they can be used and then left where the user ends the journey. They can be parked anywhere legal, though not in “Residents Only” parking bays. The company, Car2go, pays Sutton Council the cost if they are parked in a pay and dispay bay, the movements of each car being monitored by sophisticated GPS technology.\nResidents who use car clubs tell us they are an attractive and economic alternative to private car ownership for anyone who is an irregular or occasional car user, but who sometimes wants to use a car for a complex series of journeys (visiting relatives or shops, for example) where a minicab or taxi does not offer sufficient flexibility. They thus offer an alternative that is a step in the direction of more environmentally sustainable transport patterns. That said, car club and car hire users are advised to shop around, as there is quite a spread of charges between different companies.",

We will continue to promote this campaign.\nOur latest proposal is that we will be preparing a bid under TfL’s “Major Schemes Funding”, for this scheme. The bids are required to be submitted to TfL in September, so we have started work on it and Council Leader Ruth Dombey wrote to Boris Johnson on 29 May to seek his support. We will consult with stakeholders as appropriate. The bid will be for a wider scheme to improve the area around the station, a “Major Scheme” bid. Opening up and staffing the station side entrance is a matter for Southern Rail so the Council will need to enter into an agreement with them to open it up. They agreed to this ‘in principle’ during the Outer London Fund bid preparation, when the Council submitted a well-researched bid for funding under the Mayor’s Outer London Fund to facilitate the opening of the side entrance at the station.\nOpening the side entrance would be of benefit to the many commuters and other travellers who live in South Sutton Ward, who could enter and leave the station by this entrance, leading directly into The Quadrant. A page on this site (“Ward Map”) leads you to a map of the Ward, which shows the importance of opening this entrance. As rail travellers pass through the side entrance they would cross the boundary into Sutton South Ward.\nAs Sutton South Ward Councillors we strongly support this bid, as the outcome would be of benefit to our residents.\nThe Council wants to improve the “Gateway” into Sutton and the experience of those arriving in Sutton. Hence it wishes to improve Sutton station. The station is an important focal point for the town centre and the first impression that many visitors have of Sutton. It has been identified byTransport for London as a station that suffers from congestion problems due to its limited capacity in terms of the front entrance hall and ticket barriers. The Council continues to hope, in partnership with Southern Rail, to open the side entrance to the station for passenger use. In the longer term a more comprehensive re-development of the station is hoped for to expand and modernise passenger facilities and and enhance this important gateway and transport interchange.\nThe side entrance at Sutton station would cater for the considerable demand for direct access to the station from the Quadrant House office block, which houses Reed Business Information (which has approximately 2 000 employess, many of whom travel to work by train) and a number of other companies. This office block and those who work there are an important contributor to the economic vitality of Sutton. Reed Business Information fully supported the bid. The new side entrance would also serve the station car park, motor cycle and cycle parking areas, which generate considerable demand for access from that side of the station. It would also serve all the residents of Sutton South Ward who approach the station via Wellesley Road from the Langley Park Road direction.\nOpening up the side entrance, which physically is already there, requires the installation of automatic ticket barriers with Oyster readers, a new ticket machine, associated lighting, signing, communication improvements and CCTV improvements. Staffing costs would be met by Southern Rail. It is accepted that the side entrance would probably not be open all day, but using the entrance could ease the congestion at the station if open during peak hours in the morning and evening.\nDespite this strong case, the Mayor refused to support the earlier Outer London Fund bid, although accepting other aspects of the Council’s bid for funding under that scheme. We are not giving up and are taking forward this further “Major Schemes Funding” option. Let us hope for eventual success, as this development will be of value to the residents of Sutton South Ward.",

A resident suggested this was about the point where someone walking back from the station with a takeaway snack would finish it and drop rubbish.\nRe-surfacing of Hillcroome Road to deal with potholes after the hard winter of 2009/2010.\nImprovements to the layout of the Brighton Road at the junction with Ventnor Road and Devonshire Avenue, to reduce road accidents.\nImprovements made in relation to signage and road markings outside Overton Grange school due to concerns about road safety when students leave the school at the end of the day. A new, flashing “wig wag” sign (it flashes when switched on at about the time students arrive at or leave school) erected.\nThis is the “wig wag” sign.\nExpansion of Devonshire Avenue, The Avenue and Barrow Hedges primary schools will make it easier for Sutton South parents to get their children into these excellent, popular and frequently over-subscribed schools. We also succeeded in moving the polling stations from Devonshire and Barrow Hedges schools to local church halls, so the education of the children will not be disrupted for a day and related child care problems can be avoided.\nExtension of the “No Drinking Zone” into Sutton South Ward, to deal with issues of anti-social behaviour associated with a group of “all day drinkers” who tend to congregate on the corner of Cedar Road and Brighton road, the location shown in this picture.\nRepresentations made by your local Liberal Democrat Councillors to contribute to Sutton-wide response to Transport for London consultation on the future of the X26 Croydon to Heathrow service, the 80 service from Sutton station to Belmont and the 280 Tooting to Belmont service, to stress the importance to local people of these services.\nSupport for the creation of more “car club” bays in Sutton South Ward, such as this bay in Albion Road which was identified for conversion to a “car club” bay, in order to encourage better car use, reducing pollution, a “greener” Borough and policy on sustainable transport. This proposal is currently on hold but Car2go have expanded their car club service in the Ward.\nNew street trees planted, such as this one in Copse Hill. And in Copse Hill we also intervened to get Council officials to look at the potential for a flooding problem at the foot of the hill, with the cleaning out of the soakaways and other improvements.\nAction to improve the Devonshire Avenue Nature Area, involving, amongst other things, re-positioning the benches, partially removing a wall that divides up the site, possibly fencing some areas with low wooden fencing to protect the kidney vetch essential for the small blue buterfly, removing the corrugated iron sheeting found at the site and installing a small piece of play equipment for children aged 5 to 7 at the entrance, while taking action to control the habitat. The reserve is the only open space in the Ward. We have supported only limited installation of play equipment as we believe the area should continue to be a nature reserve, and our proposals are designed to ensure the habitat of the area will not be harmed. We are promoting a programme to assist the small blue butterfly.\nAction to improve the safety of pedestrians who pass under the railway bridge in Grange Vale. There is a narrow pavement and, as it is a one-way street, cars roar round the corner from the Brighton Road end and under the bridge, the driver only seeing a pedestrian on the pavement under the bridge at the last moment. This is a particular problem for parents with buggies or with small children passing under the bridge against the direction of traffic. A barrier and set of posts have been erected to slow the traffic.\nThis photo shows the improvement made.\nAction taken to discuss with BT the installation of the new generation of very large green cabinets at locations in the Ward, to ensure they are put in locations that do not cause annoyance to residents, as this box in Cedar Road does. Action to prevent the boxes being covered with unsightly advertising.\nAction to promote the sensitive re-development of Sutherland House, which is currently an eyesore, and to ensure that if it is re-developed there will be gains for the residents of the Ward through a programme of improvements funded by the developer, through the community infrastructure levy and section 106 contributions.\nAction to get the Edwardian tennis pavilion in Mayfield Road included on the Sutton Local List as a building of significant local historical importance and interest.\nCampaign launched to stop Thameslink services being terminated at Blackfriars, something that would lead to dispersion of commuters onto other services that are already packed, cut Sutton off from St. Pancras International and north London, and harm the attractiveness of Sutton to companies locating their offices away from but close to central London.\nA programe of road maintenence throughout the Ward – this picture shows line painting in Eaton Road.\nThe side entrance at Sutton station\nOur campaign continues to get the side entrance to Sutton station opened. A bid submitted by Sutton Council for funding from the Mayor’s Outer London Fund was not successful, but the campaign continues and a further bid (to TfL) has been successful. This is not the end of the story as negotiations continue on matched funding..\nWe succeeded in getting the date for the four-yearly pruning of the thousand or so street trees in Sutton South Ward brought forward to the end of 2011.

This is the text of his speech:\n“This motion is about poverty and the impact the pandemic has had in exacerbating the gap between the wealthy and the poor in what was already a very unequal society.\nIn current political debate the phrase “Levelling Up” is sometimes used, but in a vague and unspecific manner. I have always seen “levelling up” as a key political aim, but what I mean by this is the need to level up to help those in poverty. It is a preoccupation that is one of the reasons I have always wanted to play a part in public service and political life. I am a Councillor for Sutton South Ward, one of the more affluent Wards in a borough that is more affluent than most of the 32 London boroughs. But in knocking on the doors of my residents I sometimes find people living in shocking poverty, families crowded into small flats, well down the queue for social housing despite their crowded living circumstances, using food banks, often struggling to put food on the table, sometimes out of work due to long term illness but often in these circumstances despite working long hours in low paid jobs. The statistics are frightening – in a borough with a population of about 200 000 over 18 000 of our residents are in such poverty that they are relying on Universal Credit to feed themselves and make ends meet, while over 800 of our families are homeless and living temporarily in nightly-paid accommodation, often far from Sutton with all the problems of getting their children to school here.\nWho is helping these families? Not the Government, and the low point was reached on the sixth of October of last year when, on the very day that the Government cut £20 a week from the welfare support to the poorest in society, making us one of the European countries that gives least help to the poorest in society from welfare, Boris Johnson made his famous closing speech to the Tory party conference which even one Conservative newspaper described as being like an after dinner speech full of jokey one-liners rather than a serious speech, talking in serious terms, about serious problems, given by a serious politician. We are still waiting for such a speech. I doubt if we will ever get it. And I think that even the Tories now doubt we ever get it. And in recent months it has become evident that the public at large have clearly recognised we will never get it.\nThe Resolution Foundation estimated that despite the minimum wage rise and other Government tinkering, the lowest paid fifth of households will lose £280 in support this financial year – and that was before the rise in National Insurance contributions was announced, and before the coming tidal wave of inflationary pressures became clear. This is a massive sum for those whose budgets are so stretched. Not a lot of “Levelling Up” here.\nBy contrast, what does local Government do? Despite the £36 million annual cut from our budget by central Government since 2010 Sutton Council continues to give priority to services that help the poorest, in accordance with our Liberal Democrat principles. We are one of a minority of Councils keeping Meals on Wheels going. We fund Admiral nurses to help families struggling with illness and dementia. We maintain a system of crisis loans and grants for those in greatest need, though central Government support for this was cut back years ago. We support families whose children are eligible for Free School Meals due to the financial position of the family, children who might otherwise go hungry over holiday periods. We can hold our heads high.\nWe have stuck to our principles and to these policies while maintaining our concern for financial responsibility – and despite the savings and cuts to services we have had to make over the years to balance the books as Government support has been cut. The pandemic has added a further layer of financial difficulty with demands for community support that the Council has responded to magnificently, but that have been expensive.\nWhat this motion says is:\nThe pandemic has left many families struggling to survive financially\nThe actions of Government have not helped them\nWe are the key driver locally to spearhead the recovery of the community and help those in most need\nWe need to be funded properly and the welfare support to those of our residents who are the poorest in society needs to be restored.”",
  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_author_richardclifton_page_4/content_380.html": "Louise made an excellent speech on ULEZ at the Council meeting on 24 April. Richard had prepared a speech but was not called to speak, as so many members of the public and Councillors wanted to speak. So here is what he would have said.\n“My own objections to ULEZ are because it does something that is rare in British public administration – it\ncreates massive winners and losers on a random basis, for some of the losers it is devastating, and these are ordinary families not corporations or organisations.\nTo illustrate, I have a resident who purely by chance has a car that is not ULEZ compliant, who has to travel each day to a workplace not easily accessible by public transport, and for whom the consequence of paying £12.50 a day to go to work is not supportable from his income. Selling his car is difficult as the bottom has fallen out of the market for non-compliant cars. It is difficult now to obtain a second\nhand complaint car, and the cost is prohibitive even if you can find one. The supply of new cars has been disrupted by the problems related to computer chips – I have a resident who has been on a waiting list for a year, waiting to buy a new van for his business. Re-distributing non- compliant cars does nothing to improve air quality and the replacement of old cars by new is proceeding at a pace determined by supply, so quite unaffected by ULEZ. ULEZ may lead to some trips in cars being undertaken by public\ntransport, though not so much in Sutton where the public transport infrastructure is less well developed.\nSo ULEZ will, randomly, reduce some families to poverty with at best a small effect on air quality.\nClearly a major factor is the deal Sadiq Khan made with the Government to offset part of the implications of the post-pandemic collapse in TfL finances through ULEZ, in return for Government subsidy to cover the rest. So let us be clear that the Tory Government is as much implicated\nin this as the Mayor of London. In this chamber, the only political party leading the fight and not implicated in causing the problem is the Liberal Democrats.”",

Some 83% of residents said they were satisfied with the area as a place to live.\nLocal residents feel fairly well informed about about the services and benefits provided by Sutton Council, with 79% agreeing that they were well informed. 75% feel informed about how their Council tax is spent and 76% believe they can influence Council-run services in their area. In each case these figures are significantly above the figures in Sutton as a whole (the comparative figures being 64%, 65%, 51%).\nLocal residents have significantly lower levels of worry about crime in the area, for every category of crime.

  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_category_news_page_20/content_693.html": "At last some positive news on what is happening to Sutherland House, the empty building just south of the railway station in Brighton Road on the corner with Cedar Road.\nThis building has been empty far too long but we now have confirmation from the owners, Criterion Capital, that the work is well under way to renovate the building. The renovation will convert the building to 128 luxury flats with car parking spaces, one per flat.\nThey expect the work to be finished by March 2016. They will be appointing local estate agents to act for them to offer the flats for rent. We are a little surprised that they are to be offered for rent rather than sale, but given the location close to the station there will be no shortage of demand. We doubt if they will be actively marketing the flats until the work is sufficiently progressed for them to have a show flat for people to look at, but they say the work will be to a high standard.\nWe have been critical of the developers as they used a route to bypass normal planning permission requirements, but at last work is under way and we have a date by which the building will be occupied. The year 2016 will be a good one for the area with the occupation of the Subsea7 building and Sutherland House, bringing people into the area who will spend money in local shops and restaurants, which will give the whole area an uplift.\nThe argument over the future of Sutherland House was the subject of a letter from Richard published by The Guardian (the national paper, not the Sutton Guardian) on 5 February. Here is the text:\n“Sir\nCongratulations to The Guardian for exposing the loss of affordable housing that has resulted from the Government’s successive changes to planning law.\nThe latest changes are in a series that have progressively created major loopholes to excuse developers from providing affordable housing. Just south of Sutton station, in south London, there is an office building, empty for some years, which the developers propose to convert to 128 luxury flats. The day before Sutton Council’s Planning Committee was to approve the scheme, which included a significant number of affordable homes, the developers withdrew the scheme. They had spotted the advantages to them if they followed a newly-created route called “prior approval” that has now forced the Council to accept the application with zero affordable homes included.\nOn one calculation, our Borough may have lost up to 500 affordable homes due to that legislation. The latest changes you highlight are further steps on a path that is seriously undermining the efforts of local authorities to help those in dire need of better housing.\nCouncillor Richard Clifton, Chair of Planning Committee, London Borough of Sutton”\nAt the meeting of Sutton Council on 19 January Richard criticised the owners of Sutherland House for their “inertia” in relation to the re-development of the empty building.\nRichard joined with Sutton Councillor Hanna Zuchowska in pointing out that the owners withdrew an application for planning permission that included an element of affordable housing before exploiting recent changes in planning law to get permission for conversion of the building to 128 luxury flats with no affordable housing element. But still, although the building has been empty for five years, they do not get on with the re-development.\nSpeaking after the meeting Richard said “The building is still empty and a blot on the landscape. The development of the Subsea7 building, bringing 800 office jobs to the area, and the improvements associated with the Sutton Gateway project, are giving a lift to the area just south of Sutton station. We need the developers to get on with the renovation of Sutherland House.”\nThe full text of Richard’s speech, seconding a motion on affordable housing, is as follows:\n“In seconding this motion, I would like to draw attention to the opening sentence, which speaks of the widening gap between the rich and the poor.\nI find it astonishing that in my own lifetime the wealth gap between rich and poor has not just failed to diminish but has actually widened.\nThe figures are so astounding one hardly believes them – that the top 80 (eight zero) wealthiest individuals in the world own more than half the world’s wealth, that is they own as much as half the population of the planet.\nAnd in our own country about 30 billionaires own half the wealth of the nation.\nAnd the implications of this inequality are not just a matter of concern for social policy.\nA fascinating study published by the OECD last December showed that countries with a smaller and narrowing gap between rich and poor experienced higher rates of economic growth, and if the gap between rich and poor had not widened in Britain from the 1980’s the UK economy would in fact be 20% larger.\nGeorge Osborne ought to reflect on the reasons for this. If you increase the earnings of the poor they will spend it, creating income, jobs and wealth for others, but if you increase the earnings of the rich they may save much of it. He ought to remember this when he plans yet further raids on the welfare budget, on financial support to the very poorest in society, rather than asking the wealthy to contribute more.\nIt is a finding that demonstrates that the so-called “trickledown” economics so beloved of leaders on the right of the political spectrum – and that included Margaret Thatcher – whereby largesse afforded to the very rich trickled down to help the very poor, was in fact a recipe for lower growth and thus a lower increase in living standards for all.\nWe need concerted policy action to deal with this, and tax rates on the highest earners, property taxes, the minimum wage, and welfare support to the very poor, are all important aspects. But we all know that action and support for those in need can be best targeted if undertaken at a local level.\nHere in Sutton, we will continue to do what we can to build a fairer and more equal society, something of particular importance to us as Liberal Democrats, even if what we can do is sometimes at the most basic level, such as dealing with concerns about food and housing.\nAnd the fact that we have Food Banks, here in Britain, in one of the more affluent countries in the world, makes my point about inequality more eloquently than any of my words can do.\nOn housing, we can be proud of our record in Sutton.\nAs Councillor McCoy told us, the Council is promoting affordable housing, something that is vital when I find that in my own Ward changes to planning law mean that a block like Sutherland House can become 128 luxury flats with no affordable housing requirement atall. If and when the developers finally get on with it, and I deplore their inertia.\nAnd the Council is dealing with homelessness: I was heartened by the serious and concerned tone of the debate at Planning Committee on the proposal to provide short-term accommodation for homeless families in Benhill Road. It was the Committee at its best. This was on an evening – 17 December 2014 – when no less than 76 (seven six) Sutton families were homeless and in bed and breakfast accommodation, often miles from Sutton.\nMr. Mayor, we must continue our efforts as a Council to care for the most needy of our residents, while having a concern – as citizens – to promote policies, at every level, that will increase economic growth but distribute the rewards more fairly.\nI am pleased to second the motion.”",

Their new base at the David Weir Leisure Centre from August marks a significant step for both the club and the community.\nThis move, made possible through Trish’s negotiations with Sutton Council, allows players to train locally and to engage more with local residents, something they could not do while training so far away. Players have visited Rosehill Bowling Club to meet residents, reinforcing community ties, and have helped in the campaign led by Trish to re-invigorate the bowling club, which was close to going out of existence. The photos below are of the team at the bowling club.\nTrish is a trustee of Sutton United Football Foundation, whose mission is to support people of all ages and abilities. She emphasises that “Our club’s return to Sutton for training strengthens the team and the bond between sport and our local community”\nWe are working with Sutton Council to set up a Friends of Devonshire Avenue Nature Area group.\nWould you like to join it? The nature area is the only open space in our Ward, in an area where many children live in flats without access to a garden. As it is the only open space in our Ward it is precious to us. It is a nature area so requires careful management. To join the Friends group email the Sutton Council officer leading the work, Dawn Fielding\ndawn.fielding@sutton.gov.uk\nWe have secured funding for improvements to the nature area – to the signage and the seating and to clean off the graffiti. On 18 October last year the three Councillors met with several Council officers from the Parks Department at the Nature Area to discuss improvements to the area, and we subsequently took proposals to the local committee to obtain funding for improvement work. On 23 January we met with the volunteers from Sutton Nature Conservation Volunteers who were engaged in necessary maintenance activities at the site. There is discussion about how to best use the area, protect biodiversity (such as the rare “ivy broomrape” which is found in the nature area) while keeping it well used by residents, reduce litter and graffiti, and whether it should be locked at night. Please contact us with your views and to join the Friends group.\nWhile the Nature Reserve is the only open space in our Ward two parks are adjacent – Warren Park at the north eastern boundary of the Ward and Overton Park at the south western boundary. There are also steps being taken to establish Friends groups for these parks, in particular Warren Park. If you live close to one of these parks and would like to join the Friends group contact Dawn Fielding\nIn the General Election held on 4 July 2024 our Liberal Democrat candidates won convincing victories in the two Parliamentary constituencies that make up the London borough of Sutton. Our candidates – Luke Taylor in Sutton and Cheam and Bobby Dean in Carshalton and Wallington – recorded significant victories to take the two seats from the Conservatives. Trish, Louise and Richard were part of the team working for Luke in the period leading up to the election. Luke and Bobby are among 72 Liberal Democrat candidates elected to the new House of Commons.\nLuke’s victory means that for the first time, here in Sutton South Ward, we have three Liberal Democrat Councillors and a Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament, serving our residents. Luke made an excellent maiden speech in the House on 8 October, taking the opportunity to emphasise what a great place Sutton is.\nThis success followed on from some remarkable victories for Liberal Democrat candidates in the local elections held nationwide on 2 May 2024. Across England, Liberal Democrats won 521 Council seats, more than the Tories, with a net gain of 104 seats.\nTrish stood as our candidate in the Greater London Authority constituency elections. Our constituency covered Croydon as well as Sutton so this was not a winnable seat for the Liberal Democrats. However, Trish performed remarkably well. She pushed our share of the vote up from 14.4% to 15.8%. We were one of only five constituencies where we beat both the Greens and Reform, taking third place in the constituency member vote.\nTrish was our candidate for the Sutton and Croydon GLA constituency. Here she is with Richard and our Mayoral candidate, Rob Blackie, outside Sutton train station\nIn the Mayoral election our candidate, Rob Blackie, performed well. Sadiq Khan won the Mayoralty despite the unpopularity locally of ULEZ, a policy we have opposed. Our views on ULEZ are set out in articles further down.

The last time this happened it enabled us to introduce some measures to calm traffic in Cavendish Road. From Monday 19th February the tubes seen in this picture taken in The Ridgway, integral to traffic measurement equipment, appeared in many local roads at the eastern end of the Ward. The tubes collected data for seven days on the volume, speed and classification of vehicles.\nThe results of the exercise are listed below. The results have not led to some “standout” conclusion as to a problem that needs tackling. Traffic officers are examining three main issues:\nwhether action can be taken to improve the safety and the experience of pedestrians crossing the Kings Lane bridge without closing the road to vehicles. The bridge is narrow. Installing a second bridge would be impossibly expensive. Marking a pedestrian path at one side of the road might be feasible\nsimilarly, whether something can be done to improve the safety and the experience of pedestrians passing under the railway bridge in Langley Park Road\npossible improvements to the busy junction where Cedar Road crosses Langley Park Road.\nYour views on these issues, and views on any other traffic and parking issues you would like us to look at, are invited.\nThe traffic survey yielded three pieces of data on traffic movements at 17 locations in the part of Sutton South Ward east of Brighton Road. The survey was undertaken in February 2024 over a seven day period Monday to Saturday. The three pieces of data are:\nthe percentage of vehicle traffic that was heavy goods vehicles (HGVs)\nthe average speed of traffic, and\nthe average daily flow of vehicles over the seven day period.\nThe 17 traffic measurement stations are listed here, with the three pieces of data in each direction of the road, in an approximate order from north to south of the Ward, taking roads to the west of the Ward and then listing roads further east.\nKINGS LANE (Southernmost bridge)\nNorth 5.1 / 14.2 / 1350 South 6.7 / 13.9 /1119\nHILLCROOME ROAD\nEast 7.7 / 19.8 /1034 West 4.2 / 18.4 / 808\nLANGLEY PARK ROAD (at the railway bridge)\nNorth 6.9 /21.6 / 3749 South 7.0 / 22,2 / 3059\nBRIGHTON ROAD (at the junction with The Quadrant)\nNorth 8.4 / 17.9 / 6807 South 7.5 / 18.3 / 8508\nBRIGHTON ROAD (just south of the junction with Christchurch Park)\nNorth 8.5 / 25.5 / 8421 South 8.6 / 24.6 / 7599\nCEDAR ROAD (between the junctions with Brighton Road and with Langley Park Road)\nEast 8.3 / 17.8 / 2727 West 7.5 / 18.7 / 1936\nLANGLEY PARK ROAD (just north of the junction with Cavendish Road)\nNorth 5.6 / 22.4 /3034 South 5.8 / 21.3 / 3043\nLANGLEY PARK ROAD (just south of the junction with Chalgrove Road)\nFollowing the Annual Council Meeting, held on 20 May 2024, where membership of Council committees is decided, Trish, Richard and Louise continue to have important new responsibilities. Louise is continuing for a second year as our Deputy Mayor. Sutton South Councillors have made a major contribution to the Mayoralty, as prior to Louise accepting this role Trish was Mayor of Sutton for three years. Richard was Mayor of Sutton in 2016-17. Louise is now combining this role with being Chair of the Licensing Committee, and is a member of the important Housing, Economy and Business Committee.\nTrish continues as Chair of the important Audit and Governance Committee and is a member of the important Environment and Sustainable Transport Committee. Richard will continue as Chair of the Council’s Planning Committee.\nOn 14 May a sub-committee of Sutton Council’s Licensing Committee considered a string of complaints by local residents about noise nuisance from the Spaghetti Tree restaurant in Brighton Road. As the restaurant is in our Ward, none of the Ward Councillors could sit as members of the sub-committee, as those taking the decision must be independent from any local influence. The committee considered whether this anti-social behaviour, involving the frequent playing of music at loud volume and thus disturbing local residents, was a breach of the licence conditions for regulated entertainment that governed the operation of the restaurant. The committee was concerned about the disturbance and decided to vary the licence of the restaurant to prevent the playing of live and recorded music as regulated entertainment at the premises. The owner has 21 days to appeal against the decision.\nThis is sad – but the owners of premises must recognise that licence conditions are imposed to protect the local residents and they will be enforced, so they cannot be ignored without there being consequences.\nWe are always seeking ways to improve the quality of life locally. The defibrillator installed in Brighton Road outside Northumberland House, pictured above, is a potentially important facility, but we were disturbed to learn that the one at the railway station a few hundred metres north of this location has been stolen. Action is in hand to replace it.\nMany new street trees have been planted in the Ward including, in the recent period, new trees in Farm Road, Devonshire Avenue, Effingham Close, Prior Avenue and Kayemoor Road, adding to the pleasant, green, suburban feel of our Ward. We are delighted that the tree that had to be felled in Brighton Road, outside Northumberland House, as it was diseased, has been replaced, thanks to funding we obtained from the Council’s Public Realm budget.\nThe fencing in The Quadrant, nearby, which had become damaged has been repaired, also with funding we obtained from the Public Realm budget.\nIn addition, Sutton Council was delighted to be successful in obtaining funding to upgrade rail services to Belmont Station. The funding will allow train services to double from two to four trains per hour and will also facilitate improvements to the station. This will improve transport to the Cancer Hub.\nThe owners of Harrow Lodge, 28 Eaton Road, have used a device known as “Prior Approval” to obtain planning permission to extend the building – adding a storey to the top of the building, with some other changes. This will add 10 new flats to the building. In Mulgrave Road the owners of The Rowans, 47 Mulgrave Road, have similarly obtained planning application to add 8 new flats by adding two storeys to the top of the building. This is a current trend – to add extra storeys to the top of blocks of flats.\nThe applicants both used a device in national planning law known as “Prior Approval” which means that Councillors cannot take the application to the Council’s Planning Committee. We consider that this procedure was introduced to undermine the planning system and reduce local control of planning decisions. We are not able to stop these changes taking place as the system means the application has to be assessed by Council officers against a narrow set of criteria and if the application is refused the Planning Inspectorate, based in Bristol, has the power to over-ride local decisions.\nAs your local Councillors, we are concerned about these developments. While there is a need for more accommodation, these changes will involve building work that will impact on residents. However we seek to ensure that conditions are stipulated in any planning permission, if it is granted, to protect the peace and quiet of the residents during construction work. These include that access to the roof should be via an external hoist, the interior of the building should not be a storage area or building site, there should be a construction management plan, the contractors should join the Considerate Contractors’ Scheme, and there should be a liaison officer residents can contact. If scaffolding is erected it should only be erected when needed and removed as soon as it is not needed.\nA similar application for extra storeys on the roof of the building at Chelsea Court in Mulgrave Road was turned down on the basis of our representations that it would have made the building look incongruous.\nWe welcome feedback on your views on planning proposals. You can see the details of and comment on planning applications via the Sutton Council website (go to the section on planning) or comment by post to\nDevelopment Management, Civic Offices, St Nicholas Way, Sutton, SM1 1EA.\nOn 30 November Richard and Trish sat as members of the Council’s Planning Committee, with Richard chairing the meeting, to consider the fate of the B and Q site in central Sutton. This is just outside our Ward. B and Q plan to close the store next June. Richard commented that, though he is no do-it-yourself fanatic, he regretted the closure of the store, but B and Q say it no longer makes them money and they have decided to close.\nIt is inevitable that the site will be developed as housing. There is no demand for new office space (more people work at home) or new shops (more people shop using the internet) but there is a housing crisis. On the day of the discussion 970 Sutton families were homeless and living in bed and breakfast accommodation, at the expense of the Council and thus our Council tax payers. More homes are desperately needed. The philosophy in the Sutton local plan is to meet our housing targets partly through a more intensive area of development close to the town centre and near the railway station. As public transport links are good in this area it is possible to envisage a car free or “car light” development – if you have to provide a parking space for every house many fewer homes can be built. This reduces development pressure on the borough’s suburban heartland and Green Belt areas. Planning Committee often considers proposals to build on the Green Belt which we resist, but the new homes must go somewhere. The more intensive development in the town centre will inevitably include some tall buildings, and there is a cluster close to the railway station.\nEvidence was presented to the committee on action taken to deal with some of the consequences of this development, such as a need for places in local schools, demands on health services and additional strain on water and sewage systems. Richard commented that there were attractive features to the proposed development, 60% of which would be open space, including an area of public parkland, a water feature, an amphitheatre and terraced roof gardens. The most important aspect, though, was the plan for 337 “affordable” homes where Sutton Council can place the most deserving of the 2 600 families on the housing register. This will include families that are homeless or those we meet, in our Ward, who are living in dreadful housing circumstances – sometimes families with three or four children living together in tiny flats.\nThe planning application was approved. Initially all that local people will observe is the closure of the store, hoardings put up round the site and the store demolished. Then there will be building work but it will be several years before anyone moves in. Eventually, it will be an attractive, landscaped site. On the website\nOn 21 September Richard attended a “Community Walkabout” organised by Sutton Housing Partnership (SHP) at Kingslee Court and Thorn Court in Worcester Road. These events are organised to provide an opportunity for residents to raise issues of concern with SHP staff. SHP’s Chief Executive and senior SHP staff attended. A high proportion of the residents are leaseholders and many took part. The residents said they appreciated the recent re-location of the refuse bins and the re-painting of the entrance gate. Some “snagging” arising from the recent renovation work on the buildings was noted and various other concerns of the residents explored.\nOn 19 October all three Councillors attended similar “Community Walkabouts” at Sutton Court and at Beauclere House, in Brighton Road. These were again well attended by residents. A wide variety of issues were raised including the use of the garages, parking, dealing with anti-social behaviour and lighting. These exercises were thought to have been very useful by those who took part. The photo shows the group at Kingslee Court.",

And yet, not a single library had been closed in the borough. In fact, listening to what residents want has meant that Sutton was actually investing in new library services rather than closing them down to great uproar, as was the case with many other councils.\nHeather commented on a visit to the library in the Life Centre, which was exciting, well used and, with moving stacks for the books, very flexible. The computers there had been fully used and families were gathered around the computers, using them together ,\nThe relocation of the Carshalton Library to the soon to be refurbished Westcroft Centre was another imaginative development and residents would be able to choose books and other library services after having a swim or using the gym.\nAt the main Sutton Library Heather had found that there was an innovative investment in e books, plus advice for beginners as to how to use the, She had read that there were something like 16,000 books in e form.\nFinally she pointed out that in spite of all the scaremongering the mobile library still served those who found it heard to leave their home.

This consultation is called the Sutton Link and seeks views on bringing the tram to Sutton, or developing what is called a new Bus Rapid Transport (BRT) route. You can respond to the consultation at\nhttp://www.tfl.gov.uk/sutton-link\nCouncillor Whitehead, the Chair of Sutton Council’s transport liaison committee, and Sutton Council officers will be meeting with TfL London Buses in the New Year to discuss how bus services can be tailored to meet future development proposals in the borough. It will also provide an opportunity to raise any issues related to any shortcomings with existing services. A similar meeting has been held in previous years but Councillor Whitehead tells us a more thorough review of outer London services is now promised by TfL.\nThis is an opportunity to set out views on any changes we would like to see made to services in the area, including changes to frequencies or the duration of services, or route diversions/extensions to provide missing connections.\nOfficers will consider how this information is presented to TfL. However, the final decision on any such changes rests with TfL and there will be limited resources available.\nLocal residents in Sutton South Ward have raised with us the following concerns when consulted in the recent past.\nRoute frequency – although residents have commented that on some routes, such as route 80, frequency and reliability is good, bus 470 is seen as too infrequent, being only about every half hour.\nSimilarly, route S4 could be more frequent.\nA further difficulty with the 470 is that it does not run on a Sunday so our suggestions for the 470 are to increase the frequency from once every half an hour, run it on Sundays and (see below) extend it to Epsom hospital.\nThe X26 bus to Heathrow is used by many and the increased frequency of the X26 is welcome, but the buses have difficulty in keeping to the timetable, perhaps because of the length of the route. Some residents say they would not use it if travelling to Heathrow to catch a plane as it is not 100% reliable. There may thus be a case for increasing the frequency further.\nRoute length – could the 470 go to Epsom hospital rather than Epsom market as there are residents who use it to go to the hospital?\nOn route 151, the frequency and reliability is generally good but the service could be improved if some rush hour buses turned round at North Cheam, bearing in mind that the 213 duplicates the 151 onwards to Worcester Park.\nTimetabling – it is noted that the 80 and 280 buses running northwards along Brighton Road frequently arrive at the same time. Could the timetabling be looked at?\nPassenger information – it has been pointed out that the two bus stops in Mulgrave Road close to Sutton station do not include digital displays on bus arrival information. Although there are other ways of getting this information, on your mobile phone, not all passengers have the skill to get this.\nA review of the information arrangements was suggested for some routes. On route 164, at some stops the bus is recorded as a minute away or due but it does not turn up for six or seven minutes.\nOther matters – There has often been comment on arrangements at Sutton station. A resident suggested that congestion in Mulgrave Roadcould be alleviated by moving the taxi rank. It would be possible to move it to The Quadrant now the side entrance to the station is open, but this would probably be unpopular with the taxi drivers and railway passengers, and was not a proposal pursued under the Sutton Gateway project. A resident also commented that this part of Mulgrave Road has on occasions been briefly flooded during very heavy downpours. I have asked Council engineers to investigate.\nA summary of these comments, by bus route, is:\n470 – increase the frequency from once every half an hour, run it on Sundays and extend it to Epsom hospital\n151 – the service could be improved if some rush hour buses turned round at North Cheam, bearing in mind that the 213 duplicates the 151 onwards to Worcester Park\n80 and 280 – buses running northwards along Brighton Road frequently arrive at the same time so review the timetabling\n164 – review the information arrangements as at some stops the bus is recorded as a minute away or due but it does not turn up for six or seven minutes\nS1 – review the way the timetable is set out on the website\nS4 – review the frequency.\nIt should be noted that while this summary is focussed on suggesting improvements, many residents have commented to us in favourable terms on the frequency and reliability of local bus services.\nWe have put this digest of views forward to officers for consideration.

The match was played under 20/20 rules. The police won the toss and put the Muslim Cultural Welfare Association in to bat.

Residents want to increase parking in Blackbush Close, as there is a shortage of parking spaces for those living in the blocks in Bonchurch Close and Blackbush Close. It was agreed that proposals to remove yellow lines on one side of the road over a part of Blackbush Close will be actively examined. An alternative would be to extend the parking controls in the adjacent Controlled Parking Zone to the road. Richard will get back to residents as this proposal progresses.\nWe are grateful to residents of Westmoreland Drive who contacted us following our letter to residents on the subject of proposals for yellow lines controlling parking in the road. Last September The Council consulted residents on proposals for yellow lines in Westmoreland Drive, responding to concerns about access for emergency vehicles following a fire in which a resident died. The clear majority view of residents was that the initial proposals were not acceptable due to the reduction in parking spaces.\nAs local Councillors, we discussed with Council officers how to meet the wishes of residents. A reduced proposal is to free up one side of the road by removing all the proposed yellow lines on the left hand side as you walk from Ventnor Road down Westmoreland Drive but retaining those on the right. This should maintain access but meet concerns about the number of parking spaces available to residents, by reducing the restrictions on parking.\nThe Fire Service have been consulted, to be sure they will be able to gain access in an emergency when the reduced scheme is implemented. This scheme appears acceptable to a majority of residents and if it meets the concerns for emergency access it will in due course be implemented.\nBlackbush Close: where residents would like more parking to be available. The proposal is to remove the yellow line on the left but make the yellow line on the right a double yellow line for part of the road, a little beyond where this photo was taken.

There are open, public meetings held quarterly at which the police discuss the policing of the Ward with local residents. We were addressed by our Ward Constable, Constable Robyn Skivens, who went through the crime statistics for the Ward. Sutton has a lower crime rate than most outer London boroughs and our Ward has one of the lowest crime rates in Sutton. However, crime always has a significant impact on the victim and public concern remains high. The draft minutes of the meeting are as below.\nSUTTON SOUTH COMMUNITY / POLICE MEETING. 15 JANUARY 2025\nAttended by PC Robyn Skivens and PCSO Helen Maguire for the police.\nA report was given on main crime trends from 1 September to the date of the\nmeeting.\nDRUG OFFENCES\nThere had been 18 drug offences, mainly possession of drugs, mainly cannabis.\nWhile this was higher than normal the increase was partly attributable to a\nspecial police operation at Sutton train station.\nFour of these crimes were the interception by the Border Force of drug\nshipments. Where such a shipment is to premises in our Ward it will count in\nour statistics.\nBURGLARY\nThere had been 21 burglaries or attempted burglaries. This included residential\nburglaries, burglaries of garages and sheds, and some burglaries of businesses.\nIt was noted that there was usually a seasonal increase in burglary at this time\nof year as it was darker earlier.\nThere had been eight residential burglaries. However, some that had been\nreported in sheltered accommodation in the Ward were later disproved and\nattributed to dementia. A disturbing case was that of a landlord who was able\nto let himself into a flat and commit theft. Two burglaries of garages had\ninvolved theft of bicycles.\nMention was made of a shop in Brighton Road where the window was\nsmashed and the wooden panel that was then put in place to secure the\npremises was pulled away to facilitate burglary. Mention was made of the\ntheft of tools from a construction site in the Ward.\nSome burglaries had involved the theft of keys, which were then used to\ncommit further offences (theft of a car key leading to theft of a car). The police\nstressed the need to make sure keys were kept out of sight – if the keys can be\nseen from your letterbox you are inviting crime.\nVEHICLE CRIME\nThere had been 14 instances of vehicle crime (theft of vehicles, damage to\nvehicles, theft from vehicles). The police stressed the need to avoid leaving\nanything of value on display in your car, or in the car at all. An unusual crime\nhad been the theft of an excavator and a dumper from the road works in\nBrighton Road.\nTHEFT\nThere had been 23 crimes in a category the police described as “theft and\nkindred (to theft)” events. This included shoplifting, parcel theft, theft of pedal\ncycles and mobile phones. Examples mentioned included theft of scrap metal,\ntheft of a wheelie bin and theft of a wedding ring by distraction techniques.\nMAJOR CRIMES\nThere had been nine major, violent crimes in the Ward. This included several\nrobberies at the train station, a large group altercation outside a restaurant, a\nfight between two drug users, and a concerning incident of a woman who was\nfollowed from the station and robbed. There were also two incidents of arson,\nof a bin and of a Ford transit. A ULEZ camera was deliberately damaged.\nThere was an incident where a drug user was searched and a knife, and bladed\narticles, were found to be in his possession.\nThere was a disturbing incident of an anti-semitic symbol being daubed on a\nwall outside the synagogue in Cedar Road. There had been a succession of\nincidents related to a woman living in Cedar Road who had engaged in anti-\nsocial activities that had attracted a community of drug users to her premises.\nThis was now the subject of police reports to the DPS that were expected to\nlead to her being charged with serious offences.\nSPEEDING\nThe police had been conducting a programme of visits to local care homes and\nsheltered housing to talk about scams. Residents had raised with them\nconcerns about speeding in Cavendish Road, which had led to police action in\nthat road. There was a discussion of speeding in local roads including\nChalgrove Road, Langley Park Road, The Ridgway and Cavendish Road. The\npolice had been carrying out speed checks in Chalgrove Road and Cavendish\nRoad. The action in Cavendish Road had led to twelve drivers receiving\nwarnings. The police would consider further action against speeding in local\nroads, subject to resources.\nOTHER MATTERS DISCUSSED\nStaffing levels: There should be in theory be a third officer on the Ward to\nsupport Robyn and Helen, but they were coping.\nThe number of “extractions” when they were called away to join police\nexercises elsewhere in London, or at the Croydon custody suite, remained an\nissue of concern but was now running close to 35% of their time rather than\nthe 50% it had once been.\nMention was made of local concern about a story that a body had been\ndiscovered at a house in Egmont Road. The police assured the meeting that\nthere was no wider implication of this incident.\nThe next meeting was tentatively scheduled for Wednesday 14 May at Devonshire Avenue school (7pm) subject to the police checking their work rota.\nThe meeting thanked Robyn for coming back from leave to attend the meeting\nand thanked the officers for their work for the community in dealing with\ncrime in the Ward. The meeting thanked Fiona Ostler for letting us meet at the school. The date of the next meeting was provisionally set as Wednesday 14 May, at Devonshire Avenue primary school and thought continues to be given to what could be done to better publicise the meeting and get a better attendance.",

Following the speeding survey we promoted in 2011 new traffic islands in Cavendish Road have had an impact on the speed of vehicles using the road. The new zebra crossing with the re-distribution of parking bays along the road – so there is more parking along the road, which generally does slow the speed of traffic – in Cedar Road (between Brighton Road and Langley Park Road) has had some impact on speeds there.\nWe have also sought to deal with the specific problem of the speed of vehicles approaching the right turn from The Ridgway into Chalgrove Road with better signage on the road and on lamp-posts as your approach the bend.\nA proposal now under consideration and discussed by the local committee on May 25 concerns the area of the Ward west of Brighton Road. If fully implemented this would introduce a 20 mile per hour limit in the area east of Overton Road (including Overton Road) as far as the Sutton to Belmont railway line, so including these parts of Worcester Road, Grange Road, Camborne Road and Stanley Road. There would be signage to indicate the speed limit and some raised junctions, and road humps, where roads crossed. This follows a speeding survey indicating some vehicles travel too fast along these roads. There will, of course, be extensive consultation with residents before such a proposal is implemented and, given current funding restrictions and other priorities, action on this proposal – which is a proposal for Transport for London funding – cannot be guaranteed even if supported in consultation.\nWe would welcome any reactions, particularly from residents who live in the area.\nWe have also previously floated, in the list of bids to Transport for London, consultation of residents on the inclusion of Christchurch Park in the Sutton South 20mph speed limit area.",

We were addressed by our Ward Constable, Constable Robyn Skivens, who went through the crime statistics for the Ward. Sutton has a lower crime rate than most outer London boroughs and our Ward has one of the lowest crime rates in Sutton. However, crime always has a significant impact on the victim and public concern remains high. The draft minutes of the meeting are as below.\nSUTTON SOUTH COMMUNITY / POLICE MEETING. 15 JANUARY 2025\nAttended by PC Robyn Skivens and PCSO Helen Maguire for the police.\nA report was given on main crime trends from 1 September to the date of the\nmeeting.\nDRUG OFFENCES\nThere had been 18 drug offences, mainly possession of drugs, mainly cannabis.\nWhile this was higher than normal the increase was partly attributable to a\nspecial police operation at Sutton train station.\nFour of these crimes were the interception by the Border Force of drug\nshipments. Where such a shipment is to premises in our Ward it will count in\nour statistics.\nBURGLARY\nThere had been 21 burglaries or attempted burglaries. This included residential\nburglaries, burglaries of garages and sheds, and some burglaries of businesses.\nIt was noted that there was usually a seasonal increase in burglary at this time\nof year as it was darker earlier.\nThere had been eight residential burglaries. However, some that had been\nreported in sheltered accommodation in the Ward were later disproved and\nattributed to dementia. A disturbing case was that of a landlord who was able\nto let himself into a flat and commit theft. Two burglaries of garages had\ninvolved theft of bicycles.\nMention was made of a shop in Brighton Road where the window was\nsmashed and the wooden panel that was then put in place to secure the\npremises was pulled away to facilitate burglary. Mention was made of the\ntheft of tools from a construction site in the Ward.\nSome burglaries had involved the theft of keys, which were then used to\ncommit further offences (theft of a car key leading to theft of a car).

  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_category_environment_page_6/content_571.html": "At last some positive news on what is happening to Sutherland House, the empty building just south of the railway station in Brighton Road on the corner with Cedar Road.\nThis building has been empty far too long but we now have confirmation from the owners, Criterion Capital, that the work is well under way to renovate the building. The renovation will convert the building to 128 luxury flats with car parking spaces, one per flat.\nThey expect the work to be finished by March 2016. They will be appointing local estate agents to act for them to offer the flats for rent. We are a little surprised that they are to be offered for rent rather than sale, but given the location close to the station there will be no shortage of demand. We doubt if they will be actively marketing the flats until the work is sufficiently progressed for them to have a show flat for people to look at, but they say the work will be to a high standard.\nWe have been critical of the developers as they used a route to bypass normal planning permission requirements, but at last work is under way and we have a date by which the building will be occupied. The year 2016 will be a good one for the area with the occupation of the Subsea7 building and Sutherland House, bringing people into the area who will spend money in local shops and restaurants, which will give the whole area an uplift.\nThe argument over the future of Sutherland House was the subject of a letter from Richard published by The Guardian (the national paper, not the Sutton Guardian) on 5 February. Here is the text:\n“Sir\nCongratulations to The Guardian for exposing the loss of affordable housing that has resulted from the Government’s successive changes to planning law.\nThe latest changes are in a series that have progressively created major loopholes to excuse developers from providing affordable housing. Just south of Sutton station, in south London, there is an office building, empty for some years, which the developers propose to convert to 128 luxury flats. The day before Sutton Council’s Planning Committee was to approve the scheme, which included a significant number of affordable homes, the developers withdrew the scheme. They had spotted the advantages to them if they followed a newly-created route called “prior approval” that has now forced the Council to accept the application with zero affordable homes included.\nOn one calculation, our Borough may have lost up to 500 affordable homes due to that legislation. The latest changes you highlight are further steps on a path that is seriously undermining the efforts of local authorities to help those in dire need of better housing.\nCouncillor Richard Clifton, Chair of Planning Committee, London Borough of Sutton”\nAt the meeting of Sutton Council on 19 January Richard criticised the owners of Sutherland House for their “inertia” in relation to the re-development of the empty building.\nRichard joined with Sutton Councillor Hanna Zuchowska in pointing out that the owners withdrew an application for planning permission that included an element of affordable housing before exploiting recent changes in planning law to get permission for conversion of the building to 128 luxury flats with no affordable housing element. But still, although the building has been empty for five years, they do not get on with the re-development.\nSpeaking after the meeting Richard said “The building is still empty and a blot on the landscape. The development of the Subsea7 building, bringing 800 office jobs to the area, and the improvements associated with the Sutton Gateway project, are giving a lift to the area just south of Sutton station. We need the developers to get on with the renovation of Sutherland House.”\nThe full text of Richard’s speech, seconding a motion on affordable housing, is as follows:\n“In seconding this motion, I would like to draw attention to the opening sentence, which speaks of the widening gap between the rich and the poor.\nI find it astonishing that in my own lifetime the wealth gap between rich and poor has not just failed to diminish but has actually widened.\nThe figures are so astounding one hardly believes them – that the top 80 (eight zero) wealthiest individuals in the world own more than half the world’s wealth, that is they own as much as half the population of the planet.\nAnd in our own country about 30 billionaires own half the wealth of the nation.\nAnd the implications of this inequality are not just a matter of concern for social policy.\nA fascinating study published by the OECD last December showed that countries with a smaller and narrowing gap between rich and poor experienced higher rates of economic growth, and if the gap between rich and poor had not widened in Britain from the 1980’s the UK economy would in fact be 20% larger.\nGeorge Osborne ought to reflect on the reasons for this. If you increase the earnings of the poor they will spend it, creating income, jobs and wealth for others, but if you increase the earnings of the rich they may save much of it. He ought to remember this when he plans yet further raids on the welfare budget, on financial support to the very poorest in society, rather than asking the wealthy to contribute more.\nIt is a finding that demonstrates that the so-called “trickledown” economics so beloved of leaders on the right of the political spectrum – and that included Margaret Thatcher – whereby largesse afforded to the very rich trickled down to help the very poor, was in fact a recipe for lower growth and thus a lower increase in living standards for all.\nWe need concerted policy action to deal with this, and tax rates on the highest earners, property taxes, the minimum wage, and welfare support to the very poor, are all important aspects. But we all know that action and support for those in need can be best targeted if undertaken at a local level.\nHere in Sutton, we will continue to do what we can to build a fairer and more equal society, something of particular importance to us as Liberal Democrats, even if what we can do is sometimes at the most basic level, such as dealing with concerns about food and housing.\nAnd the fact that we have Food Banks, here in Britain, in one of the more affluent countries in the world, makes my point about inequality more eloquently than any of my words can do.\nOn housing, we can be proud of our record in Sutton.\nAs Councillor McCoy told us, the Council is promoting affordable housing, something that is vital when I find that in my own Ward changes to planning law mean that a block like Sutherland House can become 128 luxury flats with no affordable housing requirement atall. If and when the developers finally get on with it, and I deplore their inertia.\nAnd the Council is dealing with homelessness: I was heartened by the serious and concerned tone of the debate at Planning Committee on the proposal to provide short-term accommodation for homeless families in Benhill Road. It was the Committee at its best. This was on an evening – 17 December 2014 – when no less than 76 (seven six) Sutton families were homeless and in bed and breakfast accommodation, often miles from Sutton.\nMr. Mayor, we must continue our efforts as a Council to care for the most needy of our residents, while having a concern – as citizens – to promote policies, at every level, that will increase economic growth but distribute the rewards more fairly.\nI am pleased to second the motion.”",
  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_2013_10_20_jobs-are-gold-dust-success-in-bringing-jobs-to-sutton-south/content_805.html": "A survey across Sutton South Ward in the period immediately before the Brighton Road car park closed and immediately after shows that the closure of the Brighton Road car park has not had an impact on parking in the Ward.\nThe results are shown below.\nNow that the decision is reached on the Subsea7 proposal to build their new offices in Sutton, Richard has written to residents setting out his thoughts on the impact locally. He claims that that he and Heather are probably the most successful local Councillors in Britain, as few have been involved in attracting 500 new jobs to their Ward. He writes:\n“When I was elected in 2010 I observed that Sutton South is a generally affluent area but there are pockets of poverty, particularly in the social housing estates in the Ward. Many of these people are people who are at the margins of the labour market, often single mothers or people in their 50s who have been made redundant, unskilled and struggling to find work, people whose lives would be transformed if they could get back into employment. Jobs are gold dust.\nI cannot pretend that the Subsea7 proposal was something I was responsible for. But when it was proposed, I felt that to have a major, successful, expanding engineering company create 500 jobs in my Ward by building a modern, attractive HQ building, replacing a half empty car park, was something positive. So, with Heather, I had a lot of discussions with Subsea7 and we would like to think that we were responsible for many of the improvements made to the plans as they developed.\nThere were three sets of objections put to me by residents.\nFirst, Subsea7 could have gone to one of the other empty office buildings in Sutton. I discussed this with them. They had a number of technical objections, in particular that the size of their work teams meant any conventional 80s or earlier tower block would not be suitable as the teams would be spread over several floors. But it became clear to me that they wanted their own, prestige building, being prepared to spend surprising amounts of money employing a top firm of European architects to design it, and if we could not accept that they would go elsewhere – Epsom or Leatherhead seemed likely. In fact Sutton has suffered a decline in the number of office buildings, as many are converted to residential uses, and it is a bonus to have this new prestige office development.\nSecond, the development would only create jobs for engineers, and not for local people. This is not so. An office complex of this size will create jobs for cleaners, receptionists, clerks, drivers, catering workers etc. The site is surrounded by social housing estates ( Sutton Court , Beauclere House, Westmoreland Drive , Ambleside Gardens ) and local people within walking distance will be well placed to compete for these less skilled jobs. The workforce in this office complex will spend money in local shops and restaurants. The clients will come to these offices from, we are told, all over the world, spending money in local hotels and restaurants. This is the type of upward momentum the area needs.\nThird, it would displace parking into local streets to an unacceptable extent. The current evidence, in the immediate aftermath of closure, is that this has not happened. Heather and I insisted on a substantial discount being offered to drivers to move to Gibson Road , and the deal done by Reed to enable their staff to park in the underused B and Q car park has been significant. For the longer term, we know Network Rail is interested in expanding the station car park. There still is a problem of parking in some roads in the Ward, though the closure of Brighton Road has not affected it.\nFrom my point of view, my term as a Councillor ends next year and I would like to think I am leaving some legacy in the location in our Ward of such a prestige development by an expanding company, creating local jobs. There are very few Councillors in the UK who have got 500 new jobs in their Ward.”\nCAR PARKING SURVEY: SEPTEMBER 2013\nThis survey of the number of parked cars was carried out on a number of dates, between 9.30am and 10.30am, this being late enough for any commuter parking in local roads to be in place.\nThe count covers all roads in Sutton South Ward outside the Controlled Parking Zone, except those with other parking controls in place such as yellow lines preventing commuter parking.\nThe dates were as follows.

Most people are aware that historic buildings might be “listed” to prevent their being inappropriately developed or demolished. This is, however, a national system, and local authorities can prepare lists of local structures that are of significance locally though not grand enough to go on the national list.\nThere are four such structures in Sutton South Ward.\n- the Registrar’s office (The Russetings) in Worcester Road, a Victorian house that it is believed the Walls family, famous for Walls ice cream and Walls sausages, lived in, though this is disputed\n- Stowford in Brighton Road, a Victorian house, now the Eagle House school\n- the pavilion of the Highfield Lawns tennis club at the junction of Mayfield Road and The Ridgway, as an example of an Edwardian tennis pavilion, build by local builder Percy Vere Windebank in 1908\n- a Victorian sewer vent pipe in Hillcroome Road, one of 24 in the area, manufactured at an ironworks (W.

The results have not led to some “standout” conclusion as to a problem that needs tackling but traffic officers are examining three main issues:\n- whether action can be taken to improve the safety and the experience of pedestrians crossing the Kings Lane bridge without closing the road to vehicles. The bridge is narrow. Installing a second bridge would be impossibly expensive. Marking a pedestrian path at one side of the road might be feasible. We would welcome the views of users of the bridge, both pedestrians and motorists\n- similarly, whether something can be done to improve the safety and the experience of pedestrians passing under the railway bridge in Langley Park Road. Some proposals are to be consulted on\n- possible improvements to the busy junction where Cedar Road crosses Langley Park Road. Residents have spoken to us of the difficulties pedestrians have in crossing Langley Park Road. Consultation with residents in adjacent streets is underway on proposals to install two new traffic islands in Langley Park Road. These will form a safe area in the middle of the road so the road can be crossed by pedestrians in two phases.\nYour views on these issues, and views on any other traffic and parking issues you would like us to look at would be welcomed.",

Following a question raised by resident Mrs Ceri Schillinger and interventions by Councillor Honour, the committee agreed to investigate how to improve outdoor play areas for children in the ward. Sutton South has only one safe outdoor playing area for children, the small Devonshire Avenue Nature Reserve. In recent years, when the Local Committee had only Conservative councillors as members, Sutton South ward lost out to Cheam and Belmont and did not receive its fair share of “public realm” funding available. Now, with three Lib Dem councillors ( Heather, Richard, and Mary Burstow in Cheam) the committee is waking up to the needs of all its residents.\nCouncillor Honour said, “We want to hear what play schemes the people of Sutton South would like their children to have. Of course we do not have much space so we will need to as creative as possible, but I am glad this subject is on the agenda at last”",

This picture shows Sutherland House – it is hoped that the seat outside Sutherland House can be restored if the problems associated with public drinking in this area can be dealt with ]\nSutton Council has extended what is popularly called the “No Drinking” zone to our Ward.\nEven before we were elected, we were aware of the concerns of local residents and the problems of anti-social behaviour associated with a group of what are sometimes called “all day drinkers”. These people often congregated at the Brighton Road / Cedar Road intersection.\nFollowing a number of discussions that we, as Ward Councillors, had with the Council Executive member responsible for public order matters, Councillor Graham Tope, the Council has taken steps in a policy direction that we have advocated, to deal with the problem.\nAt present, the town centre in Sutton is a “Designated Public Place” – popularly called a “No Drinking” zone. An effect is that the group of people who drink on the street for much of the day congregated just outside the zone, in particular at the street corner at the end of Cedar Road where it meets the Brighton Road. This is close to Forest Dene Court, a large block of flats for elderly people, some of whom have expressed to us their concern about this group of drinkers. Now, the Council has extended the zone to cover an area of Sutton South Ward.\nThe area covered is a square bordered by Cedar Road, Langley Park Road, Egmont Road and the Brighton Road. The police were able to provide evidence of anti-social behaviour associated with drinking to justify including this area in the zone. Now the zone is extended to this area, the police will monitor the effect. If the problem is simply displaced to a different area, consideration can be given to a further extension.\nThe legal effect of the Designated Public Places Order is that if someone is drinking alcohol in public in this area the police can ask them to stop. If they do not stop, they are guilty of an offence.\nThe designation of the Sutton South zone was subject to public consultation. Statutory notices were placed in newspapers and on relevant websites on 11 January. Representations could be made during the consultation period, which ended on 7 February. A second statutory notice was published. The order came into force on 15 March 2011.\nAs your local Councillors, we are delighted with these developments, which we have pressed for, with the Council. We have had the support of the local police and the Sutton South police consultative committee (whose activities are reported elsewhere on this website, on the page on police matters). As a result of this development the police will be able to spend less time dealing with the anti-social behaviour associated with public drinking and spend more time on their two other priorities for our Ward, car crime and drug dealing.\nWhen the results of the new measures are clear, we hope it will then be possible to restore the seat outside Sutherland House, which was removed as it became associated with public order problems caused by this group of people.",

This year, following the tragic events in Westminster a few days previously, it was also attended by local police officers.

  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_category_sutton-station-campaign_page_2/content_18.html": "Our long-running campaign to open the side entrance to Sutton station has taken a major step forward, with the acceptance of the Council’s submission to Transport for London of a bid for £740 000 worth of funding under the TfL Major Projects scheme.\nThe project, known as the Sutton Station Gateway Major Scheme bid, will need to be the subject of further negotiation, so is not finally home and dry, but we are hopeful that it will proceed next year following confirmation from Transport for London that the bid was successful. We have been awarded £740,000 for this scheme in the 2013/14 financial year.\nRichard says “We have made this a major campaign since we were elected. Initial setbacks, such as the rejection of a bid by the Mayor under the Outer London Fund Scheme, have not deterred us. If this now goes ahead it will be good news for the residents of Sutton South Ward, particularly who commute from Sutton station, giving easier access to the station and an improved frontage in The Quadrant.”\nSutton station is the 5th busiest in South London, and the 27th busiest in the whole of Greater London, with almost 6 million passenger movements every year. It is one of 18 stations in London identified by TfL as suffering significant congestion problems.\nThe main elements in the scheme not only include opening the side entrance but extensive landscaping to improve the appearance of what will in effect be a new entrance from The Quadrant. The main elements include:\n* Opening up the side entrance to the station to improve station access and egress, improve the streetscape and improve pedestrian access to the station\n* Public realm and footway improvements in The Quadrant and at the front of the station\n* Bus stop improvements at the front of the station to improve passenger experience\n* “De-cluttering” and harmonisation of street furniture and materials\n* Junction and crossing improvements on walking routes to the station\n* Road safety improvements\n* Additional cycle parking and cycle lanes, and\n* Improved street lighting.\nBenefits of the scheme will include reduced pedestrian journey times between the station and The Quadrant, the station car park and the Langley Park Road area, as well as reduced congestion within the station main entrance and at the barriers.\nOpening the side entrance at Sutton Station will cater for the considerable demand for direct access to the station from the Quadrant House office block, which houses Reed Business Information (with approximately 2,000 employees, about one third of whom travel to work by train) and a number of other expanding companies, together with the Tudor Court office block, which houses Synergy UK. The new entrance will also serve the large station car park (which Network Rail wish to expand), and the motorcycle and cycle parking areas, which generate considerable demand for access from that side of the station. There is also direct footpath access between The Quadrant and Langley Park Road and surrounding residential streets, well-used by rail passengers. These station users currently have to walk around the side to the front of the station on a convoluted route and negotiate busy footways, bus stops and the station entrance. Most of these passengers are likely to have season tickets, and opening up the side entrance will significantly reduce their journey times and congestion outside and in the entrance hall of the main station entrance.\nWhile the Council has been lobbying for the opening up of the side entrance since the entrance was created with a retractable shutter ten years ago, the campaign took on new impetus when Richard and Heather were elected in 2010. The entrance is opened up when rail replacement buses are used during engineering work, as the buses stop in The Quadrant. This demonstrates that it is possible to open and use the entrance. Southern has supported the opening in principle, subject to funding being available to provide the barriers etc. Network Rail has also supported the scheme in principle and has assisted with business case work.\nWe will keep readers advised of further progress in the negotiations that are now underway. At the Council meeting on 14 January Richard sought re-assurance that elements such as lighting in the Quadrant and cycle parking will not be lost.",

Hooray.\nA further meeting of the project board guiding the Sutton Gateway project, a board on which Richard represents Sutton South Ward, heard on 25 September that good progress is being made with the scheme.\nThe most important news is that the building work on the side entrance is completed enabling the passageway from The Quadrant to be restored and the side entrance to be opened for passenger use. The side entrance is open from 7am to 7pm.The cycle racks next to the newly opened side entrance have been improved.\nWork at the front of the station commenced in September and will be completed by March 2015, but with no work over the Christmas period to avoid any inconvenience to shoppers. Some of the work will involve traffic diversions.\nThe project’s proposals to further develop the area around Sutton station include:\n– refitted shop fronts, new paving and newly planted trees to improve the look of the area\n– more lighting and CCTV cameras to make the area safer\n– extra cycling facilities, with new bike racks and shelters\n– a town centre clock\n– a new crossing in Brighton Road\n– the opening of the side entrance to Sutton station\n– new “legible London” signs\n– a re-arrangement of the bus stops to reduce congestion\n– an additional crossing for pedestrians outside the station\n– re-design of the Cedar Road / Brighton Road junction to improve visibility for motorists\n– it is not proposed to move the taxi rank, except that after 6.30 some taxis will be able to park immediately opposite the station, with the bus stop opposite the station moved further down Brighton Road and with some buses stopping in Mulgrave Road\n– there will be “live” bus information in Sutton station, subject to further research by Network Rail\n– the timing of the pedestrian crossing at the High Street / Grove Road / Sutton Court Road junction will be amended to give more time to cross\n– the number of parking spaces in the station area will be increased\n– general improvements in design and to the “public realm” around the station, with more flowers, more colour and better signage.\nThe changes, including the changes to the bus stops, will be completed by March 2015.\nThese changes are largely funded by grants the Council has obtained, not local Council tax payers.\nThe results of the earlier consultation exercise on the Gateway Project indicated general support for the scheme, but we were able to make a number of changes to respond to specific issues raised. In our Ward, a particular concern for the businesses was the need for a loading bay on Regents Parade just south of the station. We successfully lobbied for this to be incorporated into the scheme.\nOn 27 February Richard and former Ward Councillor Heather Honour organised a breakfast meeting with local businesses in our Ward to take their views on the Sutton Gateway project. Several joined us in the Rose Café in the Brighton Road, which serves excellent scrambled eggs (Richard’s breakfast). This is right in the area that is to be developed so we were able to chat and walk round the area to see the proposed changes.\nPublic consultation on the emerging proposals ran till 5 March. Consultation was by leaflets in the locality, questionnaires to members of the public, posters, newspaper advertisements, exhibitions, further “stakeholder” meetings and putting information in Sutton station.\nResidents and businesses close to the station were consulted, together with the emergency services and other groups with a major interest such as Network Rail, Southern Rail and TfL.\nAlso of great value will be the “legible London” signs at the station entrance. See the designs at\nhttp://www.tfl.gov.uk/microsites/legible-london/3.aspx\nRichard says “As a local man who for twenty years of my life commuted to central London by a route that meant I walked every working day along Wellesley Road and past the shuttered and barricaded side entrance, to enter the station from the front, it has long been an objective of mine to get the side entrance open. Every second counts when you are a commuter.”",

This year the survey was carried out by M.E.L Research, which surveyed 1,022 residents aged 16+ with quotas set on age, gender and work status to match the profile of the population of Sutton.\nThe percentage of respondents satisfied with how the council runs services in the borough has risen two percentage points in the past two years to 78 per cent. The satisfaction rate for the local area as a place to live has been maintained at 90 per cent compared to 2013.\nThis is despite the council having to save £74m from its annual budget between 2011 and 2019 due to unprecedented Government cuts to its annual budget.\nSo far the council has saved £43m from its annual budget, with the majority of the saving (£32m) being made without frontline services being affected. However the remaining £31m will result in services being changed, reduced and in some cases stopped which is likely to have an effect on future surveys.\nThe council launched the Sutton’s Future campaign in July 2013 to involve residents in making the savings. So far there have been more than 10,000 responses.\nThe campaign looks to have had an effect with a rise in:\n· the percentage of people saying they feel informed about how council tax is spent (48 per cent in 2013 to 65 per cent in 2015)\n· the percentage of people feel informed about Council services and benefits (49 per cent in 2013 to 64 per cent in 2015)\n· the percentage of people that they feel they can influence council-run services (44 per cent in 2013 to 51 per cent in 2015)\nOther survey results included:\n· Most residents (98 per cent) feel safe walking alone during the day in their neighbourhood. After dark, three-quarters (75 per cent) feel sale, compared with 71 per cent in 2013. The level of worry for burglary and antisocial behaviour has continued to decrease since 2011 (48 per cent and 41 per cent respectively to 37 per cent and 35 per cent in 2015).\n· More than half of residents want to know what the Council is doing but do not wish to be involved beyond that, with only 13 per cent wanting to be more involved or have a say in what the council is doing. Of those who want to be more involved or have a say, just over a third (34 per cent) would be willing to complete a questionnaire, 25 per cent to submit their views through an online channel and 28 per cent to attend a public meeting arranged by Sutton Council.\n· The satisfaction level with Sutton Council has risen consistently since 2009, when just under three-quarters (72 per cent) of residents thought the council was doing a good job. Just over six in 10 (61 per cent) agree that the council provides value for money, up from 54 per cent in 2013.\n· Residents on the whole appear to be reasonably satisfied with Council services. Since 2013, resident satisfaction has increased for services such as borough theatres, the arts and events, historic places and museums, playgrounds, sport and swimming facilities, and pavement and road maintenance.\n· However, resident satisfaction has decreased in recycling, down from 85 per cent in 2013 to 77 per cent in 2015, street cleaning from 76 per cent in 2013 to 69 per cent in 2015, refuse collection from 88 per cent in 2013 to 82 per cent in 2015, and parks and open spaces, from 87 per cent in 2013 to 82 per cent in 2015.\n· But resident satisfaction remained the same in 2013 and 2015 in parking (46 per cent), libraries (73 per cent) and street lighting (81 per cent).",

The renovation will convert the building to 128 luxury flats with car parking spaces, one per flat.\nThey expect the work to be finished by March 2016. They will be appointing local estate agents to act for them to offer the flats for rent. We are a little surprised that they are to be offered for rent rather than sale, but given the location close to the station there will be no shortage of demand. We doubt if they will be actively marketing the flats until the work is sufficiently progressed for them to have a show flat for people to look at, but they say the work will be to a high standard.\nWe have been critical of the developers as they used a route to bypass normal planning permission requirements, but at last work is under way and we have a date by which the building will be occupied. The year 2016 will be a good one for the area with the occupation of the Subsea7 building and Sutherland House, bringing people into the area who will spend money in local shops and restaurants, which will give the whole area an uplift.\nThe argument over the future of Sutherland House was the subject of a letter from Richard published by The Guardian (the national paper, not the Sutton Guardian) on 5 February. Here is the text:\n“Sir\nCongratulations to The Guardian for exposing the loss of affordable housing that has resulted from the Government’s successive changes to planning law.\nThe latest changes are in a series that have progressively created major loopholes to excuse developers from providing affordable housing. Just south of Sutton station, in south London, there is an office building, empty for some years, which the developers propose to convert to 128 luxury flats. The day before Sutton Council’s Planning Committee was to approve the scheme, which included a significant number of affordable homes, the developers withdrew the scheme. They had spotted the advantages to them if they followed a newly-created route called “prior approval” that has now forced the Council to accept the application with zero affordable homes included.\nOn one calculation, our Borough may have lost up to 500 affordable homes due to that legislation. The latest changes you highlight are further steps on a path that is seriously undermining the efforts of local authorities to help those in dire need of better housing.\nCouncillor Richard Clifton, Chair of Planning Committee, London Borough of Sutton”\nAt the meeting of Sutton Council on 19 January Richard criticised the owners of Sutherland House for their “inertia” in relation to the re-development of the empty building.\nRichard joined with Sutton Councillor Hanna Zuchowska in pointing out that the owners withdrew an application for planning permission that included an element of affordable housing before exploiting recent changes in planning law to get permission for conversion of the building to 128 luxury flats with no affordable housing element. But still, although the building has been empty for five years, they do not get on with the re-development.\nSpeaking after the meeting Richard said “The building is still empty and a blot on the landscape. The development of the Subsea7 building, bringing 800 office jobs to the area, and the improvements associated with the Sutton Gateway project, are giving a lift to the area just south of Sutton station. We need the developers to get on with the renovation of Sutherland House.”\nThe full text of Richard’s speech, seconding a motion on affordable housing, is as follows:\n“In seconding this motion, I would like to draw attention to the opening sentence, which speaks of the widening gap between the rich and the poor.\nI find it astonishing that in my own lifetime the wealth gap between rich and poor has not just failed to diminish but has actually widened.\nThe figures are so astounding one hardly believes them – that the top 80 (eight zero) wealthiest individuals in the world own more than half the world’s wealth, that is they own as much as half the population of the planet.\nAnd in our own country about 30 billionaires own half the wealth of the nation.\nAnd the implications of this inequality are not just a matter of concern for social policy.\nA fascinating study published by the OECD last December showed that countries with a smaller and narrowing gap between rich and poor experienced higher rates of economic growth, and if the gap between rich and poor had not widened in Britain from the 1980’s the UK economy would in fact be 20% larger.\nGeorge Osborne ought to reflect on the reasons for this. If you increase the earnings of the poor they will spend it, creating income, jobs and wealth for others, but if you increase the earnings of the rich they may save much of it. He ought to remember this when he plans yet further raids on the welfare budget, on financial support to the very poorest in society, rather than asking the wealthy to contribute more.\nIt is a finding that demonstrates that the so-called “trickledown” economics so beloved of leaders on the right of the political spectrum – and that included Margaret Thatcher – whereby largesse afforded to the very rich trickled down to help the very poor, was in fact a recipe for lower growth and thus a lower increase in living standards for all.\nWe need concerted policy action to deal with this, and tax rates on the highest earners, property taxes, the minimum wage, and welfare support to the very poor, are all important aspects. But we all know that action and support for those in need can be best targeted if undertaken at a local level.\nHere in Sutton, we will continue to do what we can to build a fairer and more equal society, something of particular importance to us as Liberal Democrats, even if what we can do is sometimes at the most basic level, such as dealing with concerns about food and housing.\nAnd the fact that we have Food Banks, here in Britain, in one of the more affluent countries in the world, makes my point about inequality more eloquently than any of my words can do.\nOn housing, we can be proud of our record in Sutton.\nAs Councillor McCoy told us, the Council is promoting affordable housing, something that is vital when I find that in my own Ward changes to planning law mean that a block like Sutherland House can become 128 luxury flats with no affordable housing requirement atall. If and when the developers finally get on with it, and I deplore their inertia.\nAnd the Council is dealing with homelessness: I was heartened by the serious and concerned tone of the debate at Planning Committee on the proposal to provide short-term accommodation for homeless families in Benhill Road. It was the Committee at its best. This was on an evening – 17 December 2014 – when no less than 76 (seven six) Sutton families were homeless and in bed and breakfast accommodation, often miles from Sutton.\nMr. Mayor, we must continue our efforts as a Council to care for the most needy of our residents, while having a concern – as citizens – to promote policies, at every level, that will increase economic growth but distribute the rewards more fairly.\nI am pleased to second the motion.”",
  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_author_richardclifton/content_74.html": "On 10 April there was a remarkable victory for the Liberal Democrat candidate, Richard Choi, in a by-election to elect a Councillor for Sutton Central Ward on Sutton Council. Sutton Central Ward is immediately north of our Ward, Sutton South.\nRichard got more votes than all the other six candidates added together. The result was\nLiberal Democrats 1291\nConservatives 327\nReform 282\nLabour 216\nThree other candidates (the Greens, an independent and the Christian People’s Alliance) each got less than 100 votes.\nThe Liberal Democrat share of the vote increased by 17.4%, the Conservatives fell by 10% and Labour – who finished second in this seat in 2022 – by 17.4%.\nOn 3 March the Council discussed the budget proposals for the coming year. Legally, the Council is required to set a balanced budget. With so many Councils going bust or in great financial difficulty, this was always going to be a difficult task. The problems are due to a legacy of Government cuts but also a big spike in demand for services. While people think of the Council as the body that mends the potholes, empties the bins and fixes the street lights, 70% of spending is on adult social care and children’s services (particularly for those children with special educational needs), plus the cost of finding accommodation for the homeless. There has been an increase in demand in the past year, particularly in the number of adults whose social care has to be paid for by the Council, the number of children with special educational needs and in the number of homeless families.\nRichard spoke in the debate, on homelessness – a subject in which he has a special interest due to the work history of his daughter, Ellie, who worked for many years for a homelessness charity and because as chair of Planning Committee he has a role in increasing the supply of affordable family accommodation.\nHere is Richard’s speech:\n“I would like to direct the attention of Council to paragraph 8.11 of the supplemental agenda which is discussing financial risks.\nIt says that the biggest driver of overspending by London boroughs is the number of people presenting as homeless and who need to be offered temporary accommodation.\nThe paper tells us Sutton had 1 084 households homeless and in temporary accommodation in October last year. It is a higher figure tonight. It is a frightening figure. Tonight we are discussing homelessness as a financial risk to the Council, but we all recognise that the fundamental reason for our concern is that behind so many of these cases are stories of tragedy, of families losing their homes and often winding up in bed and breakfast accommodation remote from their workplace and remote from the schools their children attend.\nThere is a housing crisis and we need more homes. Residents comment on the number of new flats being built in the centre of Sutton but we need this accommodation.\nThe aspiration of the Government to build more homes is right – but it has to be tempered by a concern about quality and about dealing with the consequences.\nSutton is very built up. It is not always easy to see where the new homes will come from, particularly when we are all rightly sensitive to the concerns of residents about inappropriate development and the pressures intensification can bring.\nIt is worthwhile re-stating the principles in our local plan for Sutton.\nWe need more housing, but it must be of good quality – good enough for Sutton, which means of high quality.\nWe aim to reduce development pressures on what I call the “suburban heartland” of the borough by concentrating development in the areas where development is appropriate.\nIn particular there is a zone of potential intensification close to the town centre where public transport connections are good. This may mean some tall buildings. It may mean car free or car light development as you can provide much more accommodation if you do not have to provide a parking space for every unit, and this is more acceptable in areas close to the railway station and the town centre where public transport connections are good.\nWe have a local plan, currently under review, which sets out how we meet the requirements for infrastructure to support an increase in population, which is an important concern of residents.\nI am always keen to point out that our local plan is not like the local plan you might find in, for example, North Korea, mandating what will be built. It is aspirational. It depends on developers bringing forward proposals. Its success depends a lot on the skills of our planning staff in negotiating with developers to secure what is good for Sutton, which may not be what makes most profit for the developer. I would like to pay tribute to the work of our planning staff and in particular the head, Andy Webber, who retires this month.\nIn the past year the planning system has had a bad press. The Government says we are going for growth, growth, growth. Quite right. But when asked what are the impediments to growth they invariably cite the planning system – which is represented as run by NIMBYS frustrating necessary development. That might well be the case in some places – not here in Sutton of course. But I think there is a counter argument that the planning system is a bastion against having fields and fields of sub-standard housing, as that is what makes money for developers. We destroy the planning system at our peril. But it is also right that we need a planning system that does not stand in the way of necessary change and renewal, but ensures high quality and appropriate development, to provide housing and to stimulate the economy.\nI think we have a good track record in Sutton in supporting high quality development and there are many examples in our borough of developments characterised by good design providing quality housing and infrastructure. That is what we need.”\nThere are a number of locations in our Ward where there are benches to enable weary pedestrians to put up their feet. At the most recent meeting of the Council’s local committee we got agreement to re-new two benches in the Ward that have deteriorated over time. These are benches in Copse Hill and the one in the photograph, which is at the junction of The Ridgway and Mayfield Road.\nThere is a history to some of the benches in our Ward. In 1988 the South Sutton Neighbourhood Association celebrated the tenth anniversary of its foundation by funding a bench in Cavendish Road close to Ambleside Gardens. The bench was, after over twenty years of use and exposure to the elements, in a very sorry state. We took action to get the bench restored, with the plaque explaining the history of the bench moved to the new bench.\nOn the 27th of January Sutton Council met. Richard raised the issue of the reasons why a recent survey by The Times newspaper ranked Sutton as the eighth most attractive place to live in England. This finding does not surprise us. We spend a lot of time knocking on the doors of our residents to introduce ourselves as your local Councillors and we find people generally say they really like Sutton, mentioning a strong sense of community, open spaces, low crime, good schools, a green and pleasant environment, parks, street trees, being convenient for London and for the countryside. This is particularly the case with people who have moved to Sutton from elsewhere, particularly those from other London boroughs, from Hong Kong and from Ukraine. Please write to us and tell us what you like about Sutton or think we can improve.\nWe are always keen to look at ways of improving our Ward.\nLast year traffic engineers undertook a study of traffic flows in our Ward and the results of the exercise are listed in a later post on this site. The results have not led to some “standout” conclusion as to a problem that needs tackling but traffic officers are examining three main issues:\nwhether action can be taken to improve the safety and the experience of pedestrians crossing the Kings Lane bridge without closing the road to vehicles. The bridge is narrow. Installing a second bridge would be impossibly expensive. Marking a pedestrian path at one side of the road might be feasible. We would welcome the views of users of the bridge, both pedestrians and motorists\nsimilarly, whether something can be done to improve the safety and the experience of pedestrians passing under the railway bridge in Langley Park Road. Some proposals are to be consulted on\npossible improvements to the busy junction where Cedar Road crosses Langley Park Road. Residents have spoken to us of the difficulties pedestrians have in crossing Langley Park Road. Consultation with residents in adjacent streets is underway on proposals to install two new traffic islands in Langley Park Road. These will form a safe area in the middle of the road so the road can be crossed by pedestrians in two phases.\nYour views on these issues, and views on any other traffic and parking issues you would like us to look at would be welcomed.\nThe police met residents of Sutton South Ward again on the evening of 15 January 2025, at Devonshire Avenue school. There are open, public meetings held quarterly at which the police discuss the policing of the Ward with local residents. We were addressed by our Ward Constable, Constable Robyn Skivens, who went through the crime statistics for the Ward. Sutton has a lower crime rate than most outer London boroughs and our Ward has one of the lowest crime rates in Sutton. However, crime always has a significant impact on the victim and public concern remains high. The draft minutes of the meeting are as below.\nSUTTON SOUTH COMMUNITY / POLICE MEETING. 15 JANUARY 2025 Attended by PC Robyn Skivens and PCSO Helen Maguire for the police. A report was given on main crime trends from 1 September to the date of the meeting. DRUG OFFENCES There had been 18 drug offences, mainly possession of drugs, mainly cannabis. While this was higher than normal the increase was partly attributable to a special police operation at Sutton train station. Four of these crimes were the interception by the Border Force of drug shipments. Where such a shipment is to premises in our Ward it will count in our statistics. BURGLARY There had been 21 burglaries or attempted burglaries. This included residential burglaries, burglaries of garages and sheds, and some burglaries of businesses. It was noted that there was usually a seasonal increase in burglary at this time of year as it was darker earlier. There had been eight residential burglaries. However, some that had been reported in sheltered accommodation in the Ward were later disproved and attributed to dementia. A disturbing case was that of a landlord who was able to let himself into a flat and commit theft. Two burglaries of garages had involved theft of bicycles. Mention was made of a shop in Brighton Road where the window was smashed and the wooden panel that was then put in place to secure the premises was pulled away to facilitate burglary. Mention was made of the theft of tools from a construction site in the Ward. Some burglaries had involved the theft of keys, which were then used to commit further offences (theft of a car key leading to theft of a car). The police stressed the need to make sure keys were kept out of sight – if the keys can be seen from your letterbox you are inviting crime.\nVEHICLE CRIME\nThere had been 14 instances of vehicle crime (theft of vehicles, damage to vehicles, theft from vehicles). The police stressed the need to avoid leaving anything of value on display in your car, or in the car at all. An unusual crime had been the theft of an excavator and a dumper from the road works in Brighton Road. THEFT There had been 23 crimes in a category the police described as “theft and kindred (to theft)” events. This included shoplifting, parcel theft, theft of pedal cycles and mobile phones. Examples mentioned included theft of scrap metal, theft of a wheelie bin and theft of a wedding ring by distraction techniques. MAJOR CRIMES There had been nine major, violent crimes in the Ward. This included several robberies at the train station, a large group altercation outside a restaurant, a fight between two drug users, and a concerning incident of a woman who was followed from the station and robbed. There were also two incidents of arson, of a bin and of a Ford transit. A ULEZ camera was deliberately damaged. There was an incident where a drug user was searched and a knife, and bladed articles, were found to be in his possession. There was a disturbing incident of an anti-semitic symbol being daubed on a wall outside the synagogue in Cedar Road. There had been a succession of incidents related to a woman living in Cedar Road who had engaged in anti- social activities that had attracted a community of drug users to her premises. This was now the subject of police reports to the DPS that were expected to lead to her being charged with serious offences. SPEEDING The police had been conducting a programme of visits to local care homes and sheltered housing to talk about scams. Residents had raised with them concerns about speeding in Cavendish Road, which had led to police action in that road. There was a discussion of speeding in local roads including Chalgrove Road, Langley Park Road, The Ridgway and Cavendish Road. The police had been carrying out speed checks in Chalgrove Road and Cavendish Road. The action in Cavendish Road had led to twelve drivers receiving warnings. The police would consider further action against speeding in local roads, subject to resources.\nOTHER MATTERS DISCUSSED Staffing levels: There should be in theory be a third officer on the Ward to support Robyn and Helen, but they were coping. The number of “extractions” when they were called away to join police exercises elsewhere in London, or at the Croydon custody suite, remained an issue of concern but was now running close to 35% of their time rather than the 50% it had once been. Mention was made of local concern about a story that a body had been discovered at a house in Egmont Road. The police assured the meeting that there was no wider implication of this incident. The next meeting was tentatively scheduled for Wednesday 14 May at Devonshire Avenue school (7pm) subject to the police checking their work rota. The meeting thanked Robyn for coming back from leave to attend the meeting and thanked the officers for their work for the community in dealing with crime in the Ward. The meeting thanked Fiona Ostler for letting us meet at the school. The date of the next meeting was provisionally set as Wednesday 14 May, at Devonshire Avenue primary school and thought continues to be given to what could be done to better publicise the meeting and get a better attendance.\nConstable Skivens, Louise, Trish and Richard with other Ward police officers at the Sutton South Hello Christmas party\nThe Phoenix Concert Band – which is based in our Ward and for which Richard plays trumpet – were busy over the Christmas period raising money for the Mayor of Sutton’s charity appeal. The band practices every Friday in the church at Christchurch in Christchurch Park. A concert in the church, staged by the band in December, drew an audience of over a hundred and raised £790 for the charity appeal. The band also played Christmas carols at an event in the Straw cafe in Manor Park in December, which raised £360. On the last Saturday before Christmas the band joined a wider group of musicians to play Christmas carols in the atrium of the St Nicholas shopping centre in Sutton (see photo) which raised £180, so £1330 in all. We were grateful to the Mayor, Councillor Colin Stears, who attended all these events. In addition the band played a concert at the Friends’ Meeting House in Cedar Road on the second Saturday in December, to entertain an enthusiastic audience before the “Second Saturday Tea” which the Quakers provide every month on the second Saturday. The Mayor of Sutton’s charities are Home-Start, Sutton, and Sutton, Kingston and Epsom – Parkinson’s UK. Our contribution to the appeal was dwarfed by the £10 000 prize for second place in the boroughs’ competition won by the Sutton float in the London New Year’s Day parade.\nWe pride ourselves on the fact that we have a network of dedicated volunteers who deliver our “FOCUS” magazine throughout the Ward. If you have the odd half hour a few times a year to support us in this way please contact us. We recently prepared an end of year newsletter to update our volunteer deliverers on our activities. We thought we would share it with those who look at our website.\n“The last year has been our most successful year in Sutton South Ward. With the election of Luke as our Member of Parliament in July we have, for the first time, three Liberal Democrat Councillors representing our Ward and a Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament representing us at Westminster. We held a successful Ward meeting on 28 November where we heard from Luke on the incredibly busy life he now has as our Member of Parliament. He has been meeting all the important community groups in Sutton and Cheam, and has made speeches in Parliament on a variety of issues – ranging from the importance of support for carers to the future of Taiwan. In his maiden speech he spoke about what a pleasant place Sutton is to live, work and raise a family, a great change from the previous MP who spent all his time running Sutton down. He is enthusiastic about his role as spokesperson for London. As Ward Councillors, we have a lot of local casework that we deal with and are doing more than our fair bit as Chairs of Council committees – Trish chairing the Audit and Governance Committee, Richard the Planning Committee and Louise combining being chair of the Licensing Committee with her role as Deputy Mayor. This is her second year as Deputy Mayor following the three years during which Trish was Mayor.\nLike every local authority, Sutton Council is pre-occupied by financial issues and struggling with some difficult decisions to balance the books. The decision to close the Registrar’s office (The Russetings) in Worcester Road was one we regretted, driven by a need to consolidate services in fewer buildings, but we believe planning controls are sufficient to protect the appearance of this attractive, locally listed, building in the street scene.\nWe have secured funding for improvements to the WArd, including new information signs at the only open space in our Ward – the Devonshire Avenue Nature Area (DANA). Maintenance of the nature area involves a balance of ensuring it is a peaceful place for people to visit while preserving the biodiversity of the site. There is now a Friends of DANA group – let us know if you would like to join it. We are already looking forward to our next electoral challenge, to retain control of the Council in 2026. We need to keep up the work of talking to our residents, delivering our literature and doorknocking. Let us know if you are interested in being one of our candidates. We welcome talking or corresponding with you and with all our residents. We hope to have further Ward meetings next year. We are really grateful for the help we get.”\nSutton South Councillors were concerned to learn about changes proposed to the organisation of the Police Cadets, who meet at a school in our ward. Currently there are over 120 cadets. However, the decision has been made to close junior cadets and cut the remaining senior cadets to just 46. Their future programme is also being severely curtailed. This will have a major impact on the youth of this borough who will no longer have the opportunity to participate in activities such as camps, parades and Duke of Edinburgh awards.\nCouncillor Louise Phelan, whose son has been a Cadet, commented “I’ve seen first-hand the benefits of being part of police cadets. They learn valuable life skills, and gain self confidence. They also support the local community and get to take part in things they wouldn’t otherwise have had the opportunity to do. For many this is a stepping stone into a career within the police force, for others the Cadets help to keep them on the right path and make better life decisions. I am incredibly concerned others will now not get these opportunities.”\nRichard has been trying to get Network Rail to cut back the vegetation on the railway bank adjacent to the southern bridge in Kings Lane as it obscures sight lines for motorists. Every autumn, after the vegetation on the railway bank has grown up, he has this correspondence with Network Rail. They have now cut back the undergrowth sufficiently for cars to be able to see if there are vehicles coming towards them across the bridge.",
  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_2022_09_30_sutton-council-launches-new-e-bike-scheme/content_298.html": "In collaboration with HumanForest Sutton Council has launched a dockless electric bike hire scheme in the borough to provide residents and visitors with Sustainable Transport options for their journeys and to meet one of the aims of the current Sustainable Transport Strategy to increase the number of local journeys made by cycle rather than by private motor vehicle. The scheme launched on 22nd September with 120 ebikes in each borough and the potential to increase the fleet size. This is a year’s trial with the option to extend the contract for a further two years. This is a year’s trial with the option to extend the contract for a further two years.\nUsers register to use the scheme via the HumanForest app and receive up to 10 minutes free use each day. Additional use time costs 17p per minute and “usage bundles” are available to reduce this. HumanForest is launching a discount scheme for NHS employees and students.\nCurrently, HumanForest operates successful schemes in Islington, Hammersmith & Fulham and the City of London. We understand that Merton Borough is considering a scheme too.\nSutton’s Sustainable Transport and Commissioning team has been working with Human Forest to identify locations where dockless e-bikes are deployed (for users to collect) and where users may also finish their ride. Known as “green bays’, ebike users are not charged for parking the e-bike in a “green bay” as a way of encouraging responsible use. E-bikes parked outside of the “green bay” are charged £1.50 (even if the user is within their daily 10 minute free allowance). Users who consistently park inconsiderately incur a penalty charge and repeat offenders may be banned from using the scheme.\nCurrently, all bays are on the footway and it is the borough’s intention to move some e-bike parking to the carriageway, once usage patterns become known and we receive funding from TfL. HumanForest is currently negotiating with Rail Operators and NHS trusts to use their land as “green bays” and, whilst this was not in place on the launch day, 22nd September, we are aware that the Royal Marsden has asked to host “green bays”. HumanForest is also talking to organisations representing those who may be adversely affected by inconsiderately parked ebikes e.g. Sutton Vision, Sutton Talking Newspapers, Sutton Living Streets and Wheels for Wellbeing.\nGeo-fencing technology is used to define the “green bays” and users will see them on the HumanForest app Bays which are found to be inconvenient to residents or visitors will be removed within 5 working days although, as these are “virtual”, we anticipate that urgent requests can occur sooner. Hire ebikes have a regulated maximum speed of 15.5 miles per hour but they can be programmed so that the motor slows in certain locations e.g. the pedestrianised sections of Sutton High Street and they can be excluded from locations where cycling is not permitted. This is work in progress which will continue during the course of the contract and we welcome resident feedback initially or during the course of the contract.\nHumanForest were appointed as the supplier for the ebike hire scheme following a procurement exercise in spring 2022 for both Sutton and Kingston Councils. This is a “concession contract” and as such the boroughs do not pay the operator, who makes revenue from bike hire and “in-app” advertisements”.\nSutton Council web pages contain links to report incorrectly or inconveniently parked ebikes and this information will be continuously updated with information on the Human Forest.",
  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_2010_12_04_true-grit/content_266.html": "[ Snow in The Ridgway – click on any of the photos on this site to see them full size ]\nThe cold weather and snow in December was a massive challenge for the gritting teams of Sutton Council. As your local Councillors, we received many enquiries concerning the gritting of particular roads. We were in frequent contact with the gritting teams.\nWhile it is inevitable that there will be roads that have not been gritted as frequently as some residents would like, the gritting teams made heroic efforts. We would like to pay particular credit to duty manager Mick Carter and his team. Mick and his team worked virtually round the clock, getting home in the early hours of the morning, during the snowy weather. We alerted Mick to a request from some elderly residents at Hampton Lodge, a block of flats for people aged over 60 and where some residents are over 90, in Cavendish Road, in Sutton South Ward. After a strenous evening gritting, a gritting machine arrived at Hampton Lodge at 1.30 in the morning. It was found that the machine was too large to get through the gates of Hampton Lodge so the driver backed the vehicle in as far as it could go and spread as much grit as possible, before putting down a mass of grit on the pavement and the road outside, so that when people left the premises they would be walking on a secure surface. Well done! Mick was still working at almost 4am when he emailed Councillor Honour to tell her what had been done. Councillor Honour said to Mick “on behalf of myself, Richard Clifton and the residents of South Sutton Ward can I say a big thank you to you and all your team. The fact that you were working at 3.56am shows the grit and determination of the whole team.”\n[ The gritting team with Councillors Honour and Clifton. Team members Mateus Malczuk, Lee Hunt, Graham Murray and Mick Carter are in the picture. The other member team member is Przemyseaw Szczygiel. ]\nPriority is given to the main and through roads, and to roads used by buses. This meant that for most of the period of snowfall the “hail and ride” “S” buses continued to run through Sutton South Ward, though the S4 was suspended for a short period by the bus company.\nThe new grit bins at many locations in Sutton South Ward, and the Council’s arrangements for distributing grit, came just in time and helped.\nPlease note that the story that you could be sued if you cleared the snow from the front of your house and then someone slipped when the area iced over again, is a complete urban myth. There is no record of anyone being successfully sued in these circumstances. We want to encourge everyone in Sutton South to consider clearing the pavement in front of their house, if able to do this (not everyone can and please don’t take risks if it’s too much hard labour in the cold), as their contribution to “The Big Society”.\nPlease get in touch with us if there is anything you want the Council to do if the cold and snowy weather returns.\n[ Gritting takes place in the early hours. This picture was taken in The Ridgway]",
  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_2012_05_11_can-we-improve-safety-at-the-kings-lane-bridge/content_471.html": "While we are concerned about safety at the Hillcroome Road / Kings Lane single track railway bridge, we have some concerns about proposals to change the layout of the Kings Lane bridge currently being put to our local committee by Sutton’s traffic engineers.\nAs your local Councillors, we have had discussions with traffic engineers about whether some simple steps could be taken to improve the safety of pedestrians and cars at the Kings Lane bridge adjacent to Hillcroome Road, at the far north east of Sutton South Ward.\nThe single lane road with no pavement means pedestrians have to walk in the road. Drivers have poor visibility as to whether a car is coming the other way and are frequently uncertain as to when to advance. The picture above illustrates the problem, as the lady with a buggy and a toddler hurries to get across the bridge while a car waits at the far side for her to get out of the way.\nSome major restructuring such as putting in a separate pedestrian bridge is unaffordable and would be disproportionate. We have considered whether more minor improvements would help, such as mirrors, steps to improve visibility, better or different signage, building out the pavement at the Hillcroome Road end to alter the alignment of vehicles as they approach, etc. The changes we championed to the layout of the road passing under the bridge at Grange Vale (reported in a post elsewhere on this site, “Action to improve safety at the Grange Vale bridge”, see archive for February 2012) have shown that it is possible to make improvements through some simple steps.\nWe are interested in the views of local people on what is feasible or useful and would like you to contact us if you have a view.\nThe proposal to change the layout at the Hillcroome Road end to “straighten up” cars approaching from that end is worth considering but would probably have little impact on the risk. We favour more public consultation on possible proposals,\nI have never heard of any accident on this bridge. Do you have any evidence of one ? I cannot help thinking that this is an invented problem. The lady with the buggy need not have hurried. I never do when on my bike.\nAs you know, this bridge was never intended to take motor traffic, but was provided for access to the farm (for horse & cart etc). I suggest that it be designated a pedestrian priority bridge and that appropriate road signs be erected at each end, along the lines \\SLOW. PEDESTRIANS HAVE PRIORITY.\\\nDear Keith\nI have been reviewing the voluminous comments section on my website on the Kings Lane bridge issue and I’m not sure if i ever responded to your comment of a long time back. I put to the traffic engineers your suggestion to have a notice that said “pedestrians have priority” (very sensible suggestion) and the reply was that this would not be allowed under DfT guidance as, under the Highway Code, they already have priority. Not a good answer but I concluded i was not going to get anywhere with the idea.\nThere is no perfect solution to the bridge and as you say accidents are rare, but the current proposal to build out the kerb on one side is a small step.\nBest wishes.\nRichard\nNeed a mirror as you approach from the park side.\nDear Adam\nI have been reviewing the comments on the Kings Lane bridge issiue on the website and I am not sure I ever replied to a comment you made a long time ago about mirrors.\nThe traffic engineers say mirrors are now contrary to TfL guidance as it seems they can confuse at night when cars have headlights. There is no perfect solution to the bridge problem except at disproportionate cost and I hope the latest proposal, building out the kerb on just one side, will be a small step.\nbest wishes.\nRichard Clifton",
  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_category_news_page_16/content_630.html": "PIONEERING EXHIBITION STAGED BY SUTTON SOUTH HELLO\nOn 7 March Ricard, as Mayor, opened a remarkable exhibition put together by Heather Honour and her Sutton South Hello team. This featured the reminiscences of elderly members of the group, based on a number of themes, such as their experience of evacuation of children during the 1939-45 war. Richard had attended some of these reminiscence sessions and found them fascinating.\nSutton South Hello goes from strength to strength.\nNEW SUBSEA7 OFFICES OPENED BY SUTTON’S MAYOR AT RIBBON CUTTING CEREMONY\nGOLD DUST FOR THE LOCAL ECONOMY: SUBSEA7 MOVE IN TO THEIR NEW HQ\nOccupation of these two buildings, increasing footfall in the area and business for local shops, restaurants and hotels, will have a positive effect on the local economy. And the Subsea7 project will keep many hundreds of jobs to our area that would otherwise have been in Epsom or Leatherhead, and add several hundred new jobs. Jobs are gold dust for the local economy.\nCRIME REMAINS LOW IN SUTTON SOUTH\nTrish and Richard attended the Ward police consultative committee meeting on 10 January. The police again reported that crime in our area remains low.\nIn the final quarter of 2016 there were 3 residential burglaries in our Ward (down from 6 in the corresponding period a year previously), 3 non-residential burglaries (down from 7), 7 thefts from motor vehicles (down from 12) and 2 thefts of motor bikes.\nThe police had executed a number of drug searches in the last quarter, which they felt had had a positive impact. Priorities continue to include drugs, looking out for rough sleepers in stairwells of blocks of flats, anti-social behaviour at bus stops, speeding checks and aggressive begging around Sutton station.\nThe police consultative panel next meets at Christchurch hall in Christchurch Park on 9 May. This is a public meeting. See if you can come.\nThere were several “Speedwatch” events in the last quarter, some involving students from Overton Grange school, using a speed gun to catch and warn speeding motorists.\nSUTHERLAND HOUSE – NOW NORTHUMBERLAND HOUSE: RESIDENTS MOVE IN\nResidents have started to move in to the the block in the Brighton Road just south of Sutton station that we all knew as Sutherland House but which now has a new name – Northumberland House. Perhaps the owners changed the name as – after it being empty for five years – they want to signal a new beginning for this building. They have spent money on the renovation and certainly improved the way it looks, as the pictures above show.\nThe apartments in the block, a few hundred yards south of Sutton station and in our Ward, are available to rent. The Acorn Group are in charge of renting out the flats. If anyone is interested in renting they can contact Kimberley Ellen (kimberley.ellen@acorn.ltd.uk or ring her 020 8315 6917). The flats are also advertised on the website Rightmove.\nOn 14 January Richard visited the block. It has been refurbished to a high standard and it is good to see it occupied. There are 128 flats with parking spaces.\nAs long ago as December 2015 we met with Council officers and the developer to discuss renovation of the front, to fit in with the Gateway scheme further north. We have sought agreement that the owners fund the renovation of the area in front of the building, to bring it up to the same standard as the area renovated during the “Gateway” project just to the north. The shops at the bottom are not fully let out and we have hopes that the area just south of the station will include of a mix of good restaurants, shops and maybe a wine bar as the area will have so much more footfall. We are pleased that the Rose cafe and Sofra are surviving. We look forward to the area in front of the building being renewed and improved in due course and the vacant shops let out. However Sainsburys have pulled out of opening a store at the bottom.\nThe area has in the past suffered from a group of “all day drinkers” who walk the streets drinking alcohol from cans. However, one of Richard’s first acts when elected in 2010 was to get the “no drinking” zone extended from Sutton town centre into Sutton South Ward. This makes it unlawful to drink alcohol in public in the area if a police officer asks you to stop.\nSTUNNING SUCCESS FOR SUTTON IN 2017 LONDON NEW YEAR’S DAY PARADE\nThe float entered by the London Borough of Sutton won fourth prize in the 2017 London New Year’s Day Parade, our best result in over a decade and a stunning achievement given the stiff competition from other London Boroughs.\nCAN YOU HELP? A CHRISTMAS APPEAL\nThe Salvation Army in Benhill Avenue is again running its Christmas Toy Appeal for vulnerable children, many whom may not receive a Christmas present this year. Tags are placed on the Christmas Tree with restricted information provided by social services, (i.e. the number of children and their ages).\nThe number of children they have been asked to consider as part of their appeal this year has increased from about 200 to about 300. The Salvation Army is concerned they will be unable to provide a gift to all the children, as they rely heavily on donations. We are sure our residents will want to contribute towards this worthy cause and help put a smile on the face of a child at Christmas.\nCELEBRATING THE CONTRIBUTION OF BLACK CULTURE TO SUTTON\nOn 29 October Richard, as Mayor of Sutton, delivered a strong message of support for the contribution those of African and Caribbean heritage have made to the borough. This is a concern Richard and Trish share – on 8 October Trish attended a service in St Paul’s Cathedral to express our detestation of the racist hate crimes that followed the Brexit vote.\nRichard was making a speech closing Black History Month, which he had opened at an event at the start of October, and he repeated themes he had raised the previous day when addressing the Annual General Meeting of Sutton’s Afro-Caribbean Heritage Association.\nWhile drawing attention to positive developments in the promotion of diversity and multiculturalism he said he had been shocked by the racist hate crimes that followed the Brexit vote, and hoped this was a phase we would quickly move on from.\nThe Mayor said:\n“Each year October is Black History Month, focused on raising the awareness of African and Caribbean history and cultural heritage, and celebrating the positive contribution of this heritage to the political, economic and cultural life of Britain.\nMy own family has a great interest in black history, in diversity and multiculturalism. Our daughter is married to man whose family comes from Ghana, so we have a grandson who is of mixed race. I look forward to having long, deep and meaningful discussions with him about diversity and multiculturalism, and what he can draw from a heritage that is both British and African. But he is only one year old, so not yet.\nFirst celebrated in the UK in 1987, Black History Month is marked annually as an important point of reference for the black community. I believe we have made progress in the UK over recent decades in tackling racist attitudes, increasing diversity, and improving equality, within Sutton and in Britain as a whole. I tell my daughter and my son-in-law that when I was growing up in the 1950s and 1960s in this country, her marriage, a white woman marrying a black African man, would have been unusual and provoked openly racist comment in the white community.\nToday, where she lives in Brixton, it is quite usual, and when I take my grandson to play groups there, such as the one I took him to in Brockwell Park last Monday, I cannot help but notice what an enormous melting pot there is of children of many different colours and racial groups, and many variation of mixed race, playing happily together. It makes me optimistic about the prospects for further progress in building a diverse community, something that is re-enforced every week when I represent the community, as Mayor, at Citizenship ceremonies, where people of many different cultural backgrounds take British citizenship.\nFor that reason I have been shocked, we have all been shocked, by the racist attacks and hate crimes following the Brexit vote, and we must pray that this is a phase we will, as a community, quickly recover from.\nSutton’s Black History Group was established in 2010 and has promoted a wide range of free community-wide events. The Group has been strongly supported by Sutton Council which is why I, the Mayoress and the Deputy Mayor Councillor Patel are here today, to show that support.”\nTAKING CRIME SERIOUSLY\nSutton South Ward has one of the lowest crime levels in London, but we cannot be complacent and need to take the simple precautions necessary to avoid making life easy for the criminal.\nWe are well served by our local police, and we meet them regularly to assess crime trends in the Ward. There are many blocks of flats in the Ward and recently there have been a small number of incidents reported to us of rough sleepers spending the night in stairwells.\nThe problem of homelessness has, of course, increased recently due to Government housing policies. We have been involved in discussions with housing managers and the police about precautions such as entryphone systems and sought to help local groups that are trying to deal with the problem of homelessness and rough sleeping. If you observe rough sleepers in stairwells it is best to contact the police on the non-emergency 101 number. They can also be directed to sources of advice such as the Salvation Army (02086429862), Shelter (02034686293) and the Sutton Civic offices (02087705800).",

Unfortunately at this time of year they drop a lot of leaves, and these are being progressively cleared up. Trees are selectively pruned on a four year cycle. A survey of the trees in Sutton South Ward has recently been completed by trained arborculturalists and a programme of tree pruning and felling will be completed in the Ward between the end of December 2014 and March 2015. The arborculturalists have carried out a full health and condition survey and the pruning recommended is to remove or minimise the potential for the trees to cause harm to people or property. Unfortunately the programme will involve the loss of a few trees, nineteen in all. We are only taking down trees which are dead, or dying, or diseased, and dangerous.\nOur contractor City Suburban Tree Surgeons will begin the work shortly and expect it will be completed by the end of March 2015. If a tree near you is felled and, after it is felled, you would like the Council to consider a replacement, let us know. The tree planting budget is, like all Council budgets, under some pressure. Residents and residents’ organisation sometimes fund planting and this is always possible.",

This one in Langley Park Road. And repairs to the chain fence in Christchurch Park at the junction with Brighton Road, with repainting.\nRICHARD WINS SECOND CONSECUTIVE BATTLE AT PLANNING COMMITTEE\nWe have said that one of our objectives is to protect the Ward from inappropriate development.\nAt Sutton Council’s Planning Committee on 6 June Richard spoke in support of two residents from Allon Court in Eaton Road in a bid to overturn a recommendation from officers to permit the erection of a further storey on the roof of the block of flats, though the block is occupied and this would have been disruptive to residents. The developer wanted to erect a penthouse on the flat roof of the building.\nThe higher building would also have blocked the light of residents in Cumnor Road.\nAfter a wide ranging debate, Richard and the residents persuaded the Committee to reject the application. Sadly, this may not be the end of the story if the developer goes to appeal – see our story below.\nAt the next meeting of the Planning Committee, on 4 July, Richard again persuaded the Committee to reject an application officers had recommended they accept, this to extend a house in Mayfield Road, The Highfields Residents’ Association had raised objection.\nOfficers have rejected a plan to demolish a house at 87 The Ridgway and build a small estate. Richard and Trish campaigned against this proposal,\nIMPROVING SUTTON SOUTH\nThe width restriction in Grange Vale slows the traffic to protect pedestrians passing under the bridge, but we are going to slightly widen the gap for cars (moving the right bollard slightly further right or the left bollard further left, by about an inch). We were surprised when, at the first Local Committee meeting (the South Sutton, Cheam and Belmont Local Committee) since the election, at Overton Grange school, on 21 June, the big issue of the evening turned out to be whether the width restriction should be modified by moving the left hand post an inch to the left or the right hand post an inch to the right. A decision was left to the traffic engineers.\nAnd two more of the vehicle activated signs to deal with speeding are to be installed, in Worcester Road and Grange Road.\nAbove, the new low energy lights being installed, these in Cavendish Road.\nBelow, the new tree replacing one that was vandalised (also pictured), in Willis Avenue. Note the protection against vandals.\nLOCAL DEMOCRACY OVER-RULED AGAIN\nWe regret that local democracy has again been overruled by the remote Planning Inspectorate, based in Bristol. The proposed development of 81 and 83 Langley Park Road to demolish the houses and build a block of nine flats was turned down by Sutton Council but then granted on appeal by the Planning Inspectorate.\nThe concerns of the Council largely related to design. We expect high quality standards of development in our Ward and could envisage a much more attractive development if this proposal was to go ahead. There were also issues about car parking, traffic and congestion, largely dismissed by the Inspector in his report.\nOur concern is with the outcome but also with the system. The Planning Inspectorate seems to us to have a bias in favour of development, come what may, and it seems wrong that local decisions taken by locally elected Councillors reflecting a local plan can be overturned with no further right of appeal.\nWhile this is a disappointing outcome, we will, as your local Councillors, continue to seek acceptable standards in proposals for development in the Ward.\nNEW JOBS FOR TRISH AND RICHARD\nAt the annual Council meeting where the new Mayor is elected, on 21 May, Richard and Trish got new jobs. Richard is to chair the new Audit and Governance Committee while Trish is a member of the important Housing, Economy and Business Committee. Steve Cook, who was Deputy Mayor when Richard was Mayor in 2016, was elected Mayor. Richard moved the nomination. This is his speech.\n“Madame Mayor, I wanted to begin my remarks by echoing what many others have said about the grace, dignity, hard work and commitment you have brought, with Councillor Heron, to the Mayoralty this year.\nSo let me turn now to another Councillor who, I know, will bring commitment and hard work to the Mayoralty in this coming year, if Council accepts my nomination tonight.\nIt gives me great pleasure to nominate, to be Mayor of the London Borough of Sutton for the year 2018-19, Councillor Steve Cook.\nI cannot resist beginning by saying that if you do accept this nomination it will be the second time in three years that the Mayor of Sutton has been a Muswell Hillbilly, as Steve and I discovered we share a common birthplace, a maternity hospital (sadly later demolished) in Alexandra Park Road in Muswell Hill, in north London. And for those too young to recognise the reference, “I’m a Muswell Hillbilly” is a song made famous by The Kinks pop group, who hail from Muswell Hill, and famous Muswell Hillbillies include Steve and myself, obviously, Ray and Dave Davies of The Kinks, Adam Ant and Alvin Stardust – so a really distinguished company of people.\nLet me tell you about Steve. Steve was born on the Queen’s coronation day, so every birthday is the anniversary of the Coronation, of Sir Edmund Hillary climbing Everest and of the D-Day landings.\nHe left school as a teenager after the tragic death of his father and after he had himself suffered a major, life threatening illness. He became a runner in the Soho film business and was such a great success that by the 1980s he had his own large scale, thriving post production studios, in Soho, in London, and in Los Angeles.\nBut Steve is a drummer, and in a particular milieu, Steve is famous, famous for the Steve Cook Soul Band, formed in 1975. The Steve Cook Soul Band was effectively the “house” band at the Grosvenor House Hotel in Park Lane for over twenty years, the industry favourite for charity balls and awards ceremonies, performing at numerous awards and film industry functions.\nI am told that at its height it had 17 members including musicians and go-go dancers.\nThere are many stories about the band. There is a story that in the 1980s they played at the Istanbul Advertising Awards ceremony, followed by a live televised gig at the Istanbul Hilton, and an international incident was narrowly avoided when the skimpily clad go-go dancers were featured on the front page of the Turkish equivalent of the News of the World.\nThe band lasted from 1975 until its last gig in 2010 – 35 glorious years.\nSteve became a Councillor in 2015 after being Chair of the local residents’ association which successfully campaigned against a huge McDonalds drive-through in Wallington.\nNow in some London Boroughs there is a tradition that whoever is Deputy Mayor one year then becomes Mayor the following year. We have not constrained ourselves in that way in Sutton but of course Steve was, with Councillor Patel, Deputy Mayor just over a year ago, so he has the experience to avoid the traps and be a great Mayor. And his wife Pauline, who had a distinguished career in education in Sutton – headteacher at Robin Hood infants school for twenty years and at Thomas Wall Nursery school for eight year – brought great dedication to the role of Deputy Mayoress, and will be an excellent Mayoress.\nMadame Mayor, I nominate Councillor Steve Cook.”\nTIMETABLE SPELT OUT FOR ACTION ON RESULTS OF CONSULTATION ON THE SOLUTIONS TO PARKING ISSUES IN THE WARD\nResidents of Sutton South Ward have been consulted on problems and solutions concerning parking in the Ward. There has been a high response and the timetable for future action has been spelt out.\nAll residents received a consultation letter from Sutton Council relating to the parking issues in our Ward. When the Council’s Environment and Neighbourhoods Committee adopted the parking strategy in late 2016, involving a programme of consultation with residents over a period of time, we were pleased at the programme of consultation proposed but unhappy with the timescales. To undertake consultation in a way the traffic engineers could cope with, action in our area would not start till well into 2018. Following our campaign, this first stage has now been brought forward.\nThe consultation document recognises that there is a high demand for commuter parking near to Sutton train station and the town centre, in our Ward. The fact that part of our area is just outside the Sutton Controlled Parking Zone (CPZ) means that there is more pressure on local roads, leading to parking problems being moved onto neighbouring streets.\nThe consultation will gather feedback from local residents in respect of parking pressures, issues and the days/times these are occurring to feed into wider analysis and development of options to progress to statutory consultation to address these issues.\nThe consultation ran until early January and response was via postage paid return envelope. Responses will be collated and analysed, the results to be fed back to consult on next steps. The timetable has now been spelt out and will involve analysis of responses and road-by-road results in the Spring, consultation on proposed options over the summer. If a clear consensus emerges there could be statutory consultation in the autumn and implementation by November.\nThere is more information at\nA NECESSARY JOB\nThe Council have pruned the cotoneasters at the triangle where Mayfield Road and The Ridgway join Farm Road. Periodic pruning is an essential part of the maintenance programme for these shrubs, and if they grow too high it affects visibility for motorists. The pruning always looks severe and has a stark impact, but these shrubs are robust and grow again quickly. The snow on the day they were pruned makes the impact look particularly severe – contrast these pictures of the triangle on the day after the pruning and the triangle last summer.\nCHECKING SPEED IN CEDAR ROAD\nCedar Road has a 20 mph limit but drivers often exceed it. On the last day of February Richard joined local police officers and Jack Hamilton, the former chair of the South Sutton Neighbourhood Association, in checking speeds with a “speed gun.” Those exceeding the speed limit will get a warning letter and action will escalate if they are caught again.\nFREE GRIT SCHEME PROVES ITS WORTH\nThe last two winters have been fairly mild with not much snow, so many of us who collected free grit under the Council’s scheme to distribute free grit against icy weather in the last two years have still got the grit. This winter is, by contrast, proving severe and the cold weather at the end of February is demonstrating to all of us the value of the grit distribution scheme.\nA PLAN FOR A SUCCESSFUL SUTTON\nTrish and Richard were members of the task group that drafted the new local plan for Sutton. After going through a process of public review by a Government Inspector, the plan was presented to and agreed by the Housing, Economy and Business Committee on 13 February. Richard addressed the Committee on what he saw as the virtues of the plan. The plan was endorsed by Council on 26 February and Richard again addressed the meeting, reminding Councillors that the process of public review – which can lead to major revision of such plans – left it virtually unscathed. The core policies of the plan survived without alteration, and are the central policies that have helped us maintain the pleasant, green, suburban character of Sutton our residents cherish. This is evidence of the strength of the document.\nThe plan supports development that is in keeping with the best in our local environment – preserving the green, suburban feel of Sutton while meeting the aspiration to have homes for our children to grow up here. The plan promotes good quality design, school places, the London Cancer Hub, surgeries, the protection of pubs, parks and open spaces, and minimum standards for housing. It also strengthens the protection of Conservation Areas and Areas of Special Local Character. It is our plan for a successful Sutton.",

The man was forced to run and jump onto a vehicle to avoid being bitten.\nAs a result the resident was sent a letter on the 13th April advising that this incident had come to the attention of police. A second letter was sent on 2nd July after her dogs had continued to behave in an unacceptable way.\nThis second letter included an Acceptable Behaviour Contract – a voluntary agreement between the resident and Sutton Council, the Met Police in Sutton and London and Quadrant Housing Trust – the resident’s landlord.\nThe contract only named one of her dogs – Governor – as she had given up Roxy at around this time. The conditions in the agreement include:\n- The dog being kept on a lead no longer than three metres in a public place including Langley Park Road, public footpaths and roads within Sutton borough\n- Clearing up after her dog\n- Regularly exercising her dog\nFailure to comply with the agreement may result in an Anti-Social Behaviour Order being obtained to stop the resident causing harassment, alarm or distress and the tenancy agreement being reviewed and even revoked.\nThe action is part of borough’s Local Environmental Awareness of Dogs (LEAD) initiative to make owners of all breeds of dog aware of their responsibilities to their pet and the wider community.\nSince August 2011 a total of 27 letters have been sent to residents whose dogs have come to the notice of police.\nPC Heath Keogh, of Sutton Police station, who is co-ordinating the LEAD initiative for the borough, said: “Whilst we want to work with residents to reduce the nuisance and concerns caused by their pets, we are equally determined that we will take whatever action we need to make sure that this happens in reality.\n“The bottom line for Sutton residents is a breach of an ASBO which could result in five years jail or a fine or both, and a possession order leading to a tenant’s eviction, for those in rented accommodation.”\nThe LEAD initiative was prompted by the fatal dog attack in Demesne Road, Wallington, on 23 December 2010, when a 52-year-old woman died after being attacked by a dog.",

Richard welcomed and congratulated the new British citizens.\nThe ceremonies are of particular interest because of the variety of people from distant parts of the world, all of whom have lived and worked in this country for a long time, who take Citizenship. On 2 January there were people from Bulgaria, Poland, India, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Trinidad, Nigeria, Egypt and the USA (from Hawaii).\nRichard says “These are invariably hard working people who have contributed to Britain and want to take the logical final step of becoming British Citizens, something that involves them passing examinations on the British way of life and on our language.

I am sorry it has not yet done so. This policy weakens planning law further and will lead to neighbour on neighbour disputes over ugly extensions. It is a recipe for neighbourhood disputes and the erection of ugly buildings that society does not want, and that we certainly do not want in Sutton. ”\nThe motion pased on 5 November was also critical of the envisaged interference of the Planning Inspectorate in local decisions on planning applications, affordable housing and section 106 contributions.\nThis is the full text of Richard’s speech:\n“It is right that the London Borough of Sutton, which has been at the intellectual vanguard of so many policies in local Government, should be at the forefront in leading a campaign against the proposals of the Government to weaken planning law.\nThe motion is a balanced motion in that we are complimenting the Government on aspects of the announcement made on 6 September that we support, but we are making clear what we oppose.\nWe support proposals concerning the funding of new affordable housing, the refurbishment of empty homes, support for the FirstBuy shared equity scheme and support for housing associations.\nBut we are critical of the extension of permitted development rights, and the envisaged interference of the Planning Inspectorate in local decisions on planning applications, affordable housing and section 106 contributions.\nWhat we are saying tonight is entirely consistent with our actions and our words on planning issues.\nIt is consistent with our words in that we had an excellent debate on planning policy at the Council meeting on 17 October last year. I remember speaking in that debate and noting what we have achieved in Sutton in adopting and refining a planning policy that has secured the green, pleasant, suburban character of Sutton that we all treasure. But we noted in that debate threats and concerns that arose from national policy. We welcomed many aspects of the National Planning Policy Framework but saw four difficulties with the planning system that should be addressed – and for each of these I could cite specific examples in Sutton South Ward:\n1. that what is permitted development is already quite permissive and is leading to people building large and intrusive structures that should be brought within planning controls\n2. that the planning system is slow moving in dealing with developers who are recalcitrant and play the system\n3. the decisions of the Planning Inspectorate are sometimes inconsistent and unhelpful\n4. the Courts do not always seem to take breaches of planning law seriously.\nThese problems remain but, sadly, the Government has not taken our advice set out in the motion we passed. Indeed, it has moved in an opposite direction in what is now proposed.\nWhat is proposed seems to abandon the National Planning Policy Framework, does not address any of the problems that concerned us, and loosens further permitted development law.\nI do not believe for one second that the relaxation of requirements to seek planning permission for extensions to domestic properties is going to unleash an avalanche of building work, thus creating jobs. To the extent that this happens, it follows that this will be through the erection of buildings that would not be permitted under current arrangements. So this is a recipe for neighbourhood disputes and the erection of ugly buildings that society does not want, and that we certainly do not want in Sutton.\nI also particularly object to the way the package deals with affordable housing and section 106 contributions. Like most of you, I find that quite a lot of my casework as a Councillor involves families that are living in poor circumstances, often because they cannot find and afford accommodation that fits their needs. We desperately need more affordable housing. There are already “get out” clauses for developers who present financial analyses seemingly proving their development is unviable if they have to provide affordable housing. I am deeply suspicious of those processes and now there are to be further “get out” routes involving the Planning Inspectorate.\nWhat we say in this motion is also consistent with our actions. We have adopted stringent controls on development to ensure it meets the local needs of Sutton, particularly on the development of major sites and on back garden development. We do not want these interfered with by remote bodies in Whitehall and Bristol.\nWe have worked hard to control development in Sutton in a way that meets what local people want. And so much flows from the way the character of the area is preserved by our planning policies, making it an attractive environment for businesses and families. I never tire of telling people of the virtues of Sutton – low crime, good schools, attractive leafy streets, good transport connections, voted the best place in London to bring up children, a local economy that is surviving the recession well. All these things, to my mind, hinge crucially on having an attractive local environment and street scene.\nI hope these proposals will be re-thought.\nI strongly believe, in the words of the motion, that it is local people, through democratically elected local authorities, who are the best judges of what development is acceptable in an area.\nI commend this motion to Council.”",
  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_page_31/content_620.html": "The BBC London news has reported tonight that, despite our efforts to date and the many flaws and criticisms of their proposals, the local NHS Better Services, Better Value (BSBV) team has decided to press ahead with recommending the closure of both St Helier and Epsom’s A&E and maternity units.\nThis is an appalling decision that flies in the face of the facts. It is not the end of the matter. It is still not too late to stop these ill-conceived plans.\nNext Wednesday (9th May) Sutton’s Clinicial Commissioning Group (CCG) will meet to consider whether it wants to consult on BSBVs proposals. The meeting will start at 1pm at St Bedes Conference Centre, St Raphael’s Hospice, London Road, North Cheam. This is not a public meeting, though it is a meeting held in public. There will be a large number of residents attending the meeting to make a silent protest against BSBVs plans and send a powerful message to the GPs and other clinicians who sit on the CCG board.\nWe are, with local MPs Paul Burstow and Tom Brake, urging as many other people as possible to write to their local GP to support St Helier.\nDespite St Helier being the best performing hospital in SW London, today’s quality has been discounted by BSBV in favour of a hope that the quality of the rest will improve in the future. You can compare the performance of our local hospitals by following this link: www.epsom-sthelier.nhs.uk/compare.\nBSBV assumes that as many as six out of ten people who use A&E do not need to be there. Even if that were true, and it is not, there are no credible costed plans to deliver the expansion in community health and GP services necessary to reverse the rising demand for A&E.\nBSBV claim that their proposals are necessary to improve patient safety. They want to have more consultants on hand, which is a good idea. But rather than taking the steps necessary to recruit them, they want to embark on a £350 million building programme to expand the remaining hospitals. They do not have any guarantees that this money will be available from the Treasury and no idea what they will do if it is not provided.\nRather than looking for the simplest, lowest cost way of delivering improved patient safety they are set on a disruptive, highly complex and risky enterprise.\nPlease write to your GP and urge them to lobby the CCG to drop the plans and opt for a less expensive and less risky alternative. Ask them to join with you and other residents in supporting our local A&E and maternity units.\nSUTHERLAND HOUSE PROPOSALS PUT PROFITS BEFORE PEOPLE\nThe latest proposals for redevelopment of Sutherland House go to the Development Control Committee on Wednesday 8 May. Richard and Heather support the recommendation of the Council’s Planning Department to oppose the proposals.\nWe want to see Sutherland House re-developed, but not at any price. What is most objectionable is the lack of inclusion of affordable housing, despite evidence to be presented to the Committee that massive profits will be made by the developers and that they could afford to make such a contribution to the local community. There will be 160 private, luxury flats in the development. Richard and Heather, in their casework, meet local families with small children living in horribly over-crowded conditions. These developers can afford to do more for the community! An independent assessment of their proposals shows that the profits they will make are £3.67million beyond what would be “normal” profits.\nThe proposal will go to the Planning Inspectorate who will, we hope, insist of some provision of affordable housing, something that would be normal in such a big housing development. The reasons given for opposing the current proposal are, in full:\n| The proposal does not include any affordable housing which would cause harm to the promotion of mixed and balanced communities and would fail to contribute towards addressing the lack of affordable houses in Sutton and London in general. In addition, the lack of employment generating uses proposed would undermine the policies that underpin the future economic growth of Sutton and would fail to promote the vitality and viability of the Town Centre. Having independently reviewed the applicant’s viability assessment submitted with the application the Councils independent experts disagree with some of the assumptions that underpin the applicant’s figures. The Council’s independent consultant considers the scheme has a surplus of £2.9m in addition to the £670,000 the appellant allows for S106 payments and the developers profit, whilst still providing a viable scheme. This means that approximately £3.67m could be spent on providing affordable housing, planning contributions and/or employment uses along with a CIL payment of approximately £40,000. | |||\n• The over-concentration of restaurant uses proposed at ground floor level is considered unacceptable and would mean the over-supply of food and drink uses, which would limit the range, choice and interest of uses in this parade.\n|\nRICHARD WINS PARTIAL SUCCESS ON OPPOSITION TO PROPOSALS TO WEAKEN PLANNING LAW\nThe post immediately below this describes the efforts Richard has made, including successfully moving a motion at last November’s meeting of Sutton Council, to resist Government plans to make it possible to build larger extensions to houses without need of planning permission.\nThese efforts have been to some degree successful as on 19 April the Government introduced an amendment to their proposals that goes some way towards meeting the objections we raised. However, the statement is confused and we await sight of the Regulations to be made nder the Act to really understand what is now the position. The Minister indicated that, in respect of extensions that would otherwise require planning permission but these proposals wanted to exempt, the occupier would need to provide a written description and a plan of the proposed development and give it to the local planning authority. The owner or occupier of any land or property “adjoining” the property where the changes are to be made will be notified of the proposed development and of the period they have to object. The local planning authority will then consider whether it will have an unacceptable impact and if a planning application is needed.\nThe statement quoted figures of 6 metres and 4.5 metres and says these provisions will be repealed in April 2016. This is consistent with Government statements that the objective was to create work for builders as a temporary provision to increase economic activity. We have always disputed that it would have such an effect, and that any such effect would be at the expense of neighbour disputes and the erection of ugly buildings. We assume the current proposal involves a return to the status quo in April 2016\nRICHARD CONDEMNS GOVERNMENT ACTION TO WEAKEN PLANNING LAW\nOn the day when the House of Commons approved Government proposals to weaken planning law in respect of house extensions, Richard has drawn attention to the motion he successfully moved at the Sutton Council meeting last November, calling for this policy to be scrapped.\nAnd he has congratulated our MP Paul Burstow on voting against the proposal.\nThe motion moved by Richard at the Council meeting on 5 November said:\n“This Council opposes … the Secretary of State’s proposals for planning permission – currently required for extensions of more than three or four metres from the rear wall of any home – to only be needed for those reaching beyond 8m for detached homes and 6m for others.”\nRichard says “Sutton Council passed my motion to call on the Government to change its mind.

I am deeply suspicious of those processes and now there are to be further “get out” routes involving the Planning Inspectorate.\nWhat we say in this motion is also consistent with our actions. We have adopted stringent controls on development to ensure it meets the local needs of Sutton, particularly on the development of major sites and on back garden development. We do not want these interfered with by remote bodies in Whitehall and Bristol.\nWe have worked hard to control development in Sutton in a way that meets what local people want. And so much flows from the way the character of the area is preserved by our planning policies, making it an attractive environment for businesses and families. I never tire of telling people of the virtues of Sutton – low crime, good schools, attractive leafy streets, good transport connections, voted the best place in London to bring up children, a local economy that is surviving the recession well. All these things, to my mind, hinge crucially on having an attractive local environment and street scene.\nI hope these proposals will be re-thought.\nI strongly believe, in the words of the motion, that it is local people, through democratically elected local authorities, who are the best judges of what development is acceptable in an area.\nI commend this motion to Council.”\nRICHARD AND HEATHER CONDEMN NEW DELAY ON SUTHERLAND HOUSE\nCriterion Capital, the owners at Sutherland House, are further delaying progress on the development of this almost derelict building.\nHaving submitted a planning application to develop the building as residential units they have abruptly cut off further discussion with Sutton Council’s planners and, using one of the devices open to developers who wish to bypass local arrangements, got the application referred to the Planning Inspectorate. The route chosen means we are now faced with a lengthy delay and a set of formal hearings.\nThe building is an important feature of the “gateway to Sutton” from the South and Gatwick Airport.\nAfter the Criterion Capital got agreement to plans for a hotel, flats and shops at Sutherland House some years ago, they changed their mind and opted for a development involving only private flats. This proposal did not include plans for any affordable housing, a usual requirement for large-scale residential development, to meet the current shortage of affordable homes. Richard and Heather would like to see some affordable housing offered in this proposal, and it was this issue that was still under discussion when the developers decided to involve the Planning Inspectorate.\nThese tactics mean that the residents of Sutton South are still confronted with a dilapidated building, with shops boarded up, that drags the whole area down, and we now have to await the outcome of a long-winded formal enquiry process.\nHeather and Richard have been demanding action on the building since they were elected.\nRichard said, ” The dilapidated building pulls down the whole area. It is not fair that residents should be confronted with this eyesore. Developers know that they need to provide affordable housing in a residential development such as this, and I will be disappointed if no affordable housing is required.”\nHeather further commented,” The location of Sutherland House is at the gateway to Sutton. With Opportunity Sutton attracting new business to Sutton, this site needs to brought up to standard.”\nIn the past a cannabis factory has been found in the building by police. Criterion Capital also were the developers of a site in Colliers Wood that remained empty for years.\nSPEEDING SURVEY RESULTS BRING ACTION\nSPEEDING IN CAVENDISH ROAD AND CEDAR ROAD\nOn 16 July last year we were pleased to present to Sutton Council the petition signed by over 70 residents of Cavendish Road concerning cars speeding in the road. We then discussed with Council officers how to deal with the concerns raised. We noted that residents of Cedar Road had also raised concerns about speeding.\nWe obtained funding for a survey of the speed of vehicles in Cavendish Road, and got this extended to other local roads, including Cedar Road. The survey was conducted last November and December – local residents may have seen the measuring equipment (pictured above) at the roadside and with the tubes straddling the road. The traffic engineers concluded that the volume and speed of traffic in Cavendish Road has “created an environment in Cavendish Road that is perceived to be unacceptable for pedestrians and vulnerable road users to cross the road in confidence and safety.”\nIn the light of this, it is proposed to introduce traffic control measures at two locations in Cavendish Road, either a crossing with “road narrowing” build-outs from each side and one lane in the middle or a pedestrian refuge centre island. One will be close to Fiske Court and Hampton Lodge, one will be close to Richard Sharples Court.\nThe traffic engineers also concluded that the volume and speed of traffic in Cedar Road has “created an unfriendly and difficult environment for the pedestrians and the vulnerable road users to negotiate the traffic and cross the road in a safe manner.”\nAs a result, it is proposed to introduce traffic control measures at two locations in Cedar Road – a crossing with “road narrowing” build-outs from each side and one lane in the middle near Ashdown Court and Cedar Court, and a Zebra Crossing with a raised table near the Friends’ Meeting House and Forest Dean Court. The Zebra Crossing is something we have long campaigned for.\nThe precise date for this work is not yet agreed as financial restrictions mean there is no funding available till next year, but we are working to try to get the date brought forward.\nWe believe these improvements will help reduce the speeding problem and help people cross the road. We are delighted to have been able to get this result, following from the petition and the concerns raised with us by Cavendish Road and Cedar Road residents.\nCRIME FALLS FURTHER IN SUTTON SOUTH\nOne of the themes Richard and Heather return to from time to time is the good things about Sutton.\nIn his speech to the Council on 4 March (you can find the text of this on his blog under 4 March) Richard mentioned how employers he has met through the “Opportunity Sutton” programme tell him of the things their employees like about Sutton – low crime, good schools, voted the best place in London to bring up children, a pleasant green and suburban atmosphere.\nThis week we met the local police for the quarterly consultative meeting of the Sutton South Police Panel. Again, the police were able to present statistics showing a fall in crime in the Ward.\nThere is a full report on the meeting on the page on this site titled “Sutton Police.”\nA NICE DISPLAY !\nAfter extensive correspondence with Council officers and raising the matter at the Local Committee, we have succeeded in getting a very good display to brighten up the crossing outside Sutherland House, in the Brighton Road. The baskets are an attractive display.\nThis “Gateway to Sutton” area needs brightening up. We hope to get Sutherland House sorted out and occupied in the next year, despite the current delay (see our article below). If the project to build a dramatic-looking new building on the site of the Brighton Road car park were to come to fruition (and there is a long way to go on this, including consideration of a planning application against local development policies), the gateway to Sutton from the South would be much improved. The baskets are an important contribution.\nPREVENTING HOMELESSNESS\nRichard spoke up on behalf of those threatened with homelessness, and supported the Council’s efforts to try to prevent people being made homeless, during a discussion on homelessness in the Council Committee of which he is vice-chair.\nOn 19 March the Housing, Economy and Business Committee (HEB) discussed the efforts the Council makes to prevent people who are threatened with eviction becoming homeless.\nDrawing on the casework he deals with as a Councillor, Richard pointed out that being threatened with eviction from one’s home – being out on the street or placed in bed and breakfast accommodation many miles away – was a terrifying prospect for the families involved. It can lead to family break up and people losing their jobs if they wind up in bed and breakfast accommodation far away. In the recession, there are many reasons why this may happen, in particular redundancy. Every effort should be made to keep people in their homes while efforts are made to find them other suitable accommodation they can move to.\nLandlords, sometimes because they are intent on jacking up rents, may try to remove tenants without going through a proper legal process. The policy of the Council is to insist the proper process is followed and to give those threatened with homelessness advice and support, trying to find them some other private sector accommodation. In most cases this is successful, but it is often quite late in the process that a solution is found.\nRichard argued that people should not be pressured into leaving their accommodation early in the legal process, if no alternative accommodation had been found. If they were pressured into leaving their accommodation two problems arose:\n– it reduces the time available to the Council’s support team to find them an alternative home, and an alternative was often found quite late in the process, meaning they would have to go into bed and breakfast\n– there was a danger that they might, in law, be deemed to have made themselves intentionally homeless, in which case what support the Council can provide is limited.\nRichard therefore supported a policy of avoiding putting pressure on people to leave their accommodation early in the legal process, and that the Council should only accept that someone is homeless and put them in B and B accommodation before the process is exhausted if and when it is fundamentally evident that no alternative accommodation will become available.\nANOTHER TREE IN COPSE HILL\nWhen Richard was first was elected a Sutton Councillor for our area, in 2010, one of the first pieces of casework he dealt with concerned approaches from residents in Copse Hill about the loss of trees that had been hit by cars. He succeeded in getting several replacement trees, including one planted outside number 24.\nHe was upset to see, recently, that the tree had been vandalised, and lost. He has now got a further replacement planted. At present it is wet but he has asked local residents to check, if we have a dry summer, that the tree has enough water.",

Bexley, ranked 93, was just below Sutton. All other London Boroughs in south London came above Sutton, with higher net revenue figures.\nThe study, based on annual returns to the Department of Communities and Local Government, examined gross figures for revenue offset against the cost of running parking operations (excluding capital costs).\nRichard said “While I have criticisms of the value of this study in terms of the way statistics are used, the study is consistent with something we already knew. Parking charges in Sutton are very reasonable to the motorist and to local residents.”",

On 9 January Richard attended a hearing on the appeal conducted by the Planning Inspectorate, and spoke up for the interests of local residents. Richard helped the previous owner get permission for the change of use of the building from being a care home, when the care home closed, to being a residential property, as the owner said she intended to live in it. He also helped her get Sutton Housing Partnership to repair the fence at the back.\nWe regret that the national planning system allows developers to bypass local democracy and appeal to this remote body, whose decision is final.",

The full text of his speech is on his blog, on this website (see “Richard’s Blog”). Here is the text of Heather’s speech.\nWhat Heather said to Council about jobs in Sutton 4th November 2013\n“As someone who spent nearly twenty five years working for British companies, I am pleased to speak in favour of this motion.\nThat experience is why I have strongly supported Subsea 7”s vote of confidence in Sutton and its wish to expand here. I regard this as a litmus test for business support in this Borough. Because the company is growing and winning contracts overseas. This is what we need. It plans to create nearly 500 new jobs in Sutton, and not just in engineering. This was described by a Conservative as “just a few” earlier in this debate.\nThose jobs are vital in the current economic climate and should not be dismissed. Those extra jobs will lead to more business for local shops, cafes and restaurants. Surprisingly the Leader of the Opposition found this difficult to understand at a recent Strategy and Resources Committee.\nSubsea 7 wants to encourage people in Sutton to understand the opportunities in engineering. For the last few years the company has been going into local schools and talking to young people about careers in engineering, and it plans to expand this, for example by inviting GCSE and A Level students into their offices to get “up close and personal “ and see the excitement that there is in engineering.\nWe need engineers if British manufacturing is to compete internationally. The company’s new investment will also lead to over £500,000 in community developments through section 106 funding. In my book that means more jobs.\nThe company must therefore have been surprised to find that the immediate reaction from the local Conservatives was to oppose its plans to expand. As we heard tonight, they continue to do so.\nNo wonder William Hague had to pay a flying visit down here!\nI am delighted to be a member of the local party that has been so successful at the ballot box that it can offer practical measures to support business rather than the hot airwe get from the Opposition.”",

There are open, public meetings held quarterly at which the police discuss the policing of the Ward with local residents. We were addressed by our Ward Constable, Constable Robyn Skivens, who went through the crime statistics for the Ward. Sutton has a lower crime rate than most outer London boroughs and our Ward has one of the lowest crime rates in Sutton. However, crime always has a significant impact on the victim and public concern remains high. The draft minutes of the meeting are as below.\nSUTTON SOUTH COMMUNITY / POLICE MEETING. 15 JANUARY 2025\nAttended by PC Robyn Skivens and PCSO Helen Maguire for the police.\nA report was given on main crime trends from 1 September to the date of the\nmeeting.\nDRUG OFFENCES\nThere had been 18 drug offences, mainly possession of drugs, mainly cannabis.\nWhile this was higher than normal the increase was partly attributable to a\nspecial police operation at Sutton train station.\nFour of these crimes were the interception by the Border Force of drug\nshipments. Where such a shipment is to premises in our Ward it will count in\nour statistics.\nBURGLARY\nThere had been 21 burglaries or attempted burglaries. This included residential\nburglaries, burglaries of garages and sheds, and some burglaries of businesses.\nIt was noted that there was usually a seasonal increase in burglary at this time\nof year as it was darker earlier.\nThere had been eight residential burglaries. However, some that had been\nreported in sheltered accommodation in the Ward were later disproved and\nattributed to dementia. A disturbing case was that of a landlord who was able\nto let himself into a flat and commit theft. Two burglaries of garages had\ninvolved theft of bicycles.\nMention was made of a shop in Brighton Road where the window was\nsmashed and the wooden panel that was then put in place to secure the\npremises was pulled away to facilitate burglary. Mention was made of the\ntheft of tools from a construction site in the Ward.\nSome burglaries had involved the theft of keys, which were then used to\ncommit further offences (theft of a car key leading to theft of a car). The police\nstressed the need to make sure keys were kept out of sight – if the keys can be\nseen from your letterbox you are inviting crime.\nVEHICLE CRIME\nThere had been 14 instances of vehicle crime (theft of vehicles, damage to\nvehicles, theft from vehicles). The police stressed the need to avoid leaving\nanything of value on display in your car, or in the car at all. An unusual crime\nhad been the theft of an excavator and a dumper from the road works in\nBrighton Road.\nTHEFT\nThere had been 23 crimes in a category the police described as “theft and\nkindred (to theft)” events. This included shoplifting, parcel theft, theft of pedal\ncycles and mobile phones. Examples mentioned included theft of scrap metal,\ntheft of a wheelie bin and theft of a wedding ring by distraction techniques.\nMAJOR CRIMES\nThere had been nine major, violent crimes in the Ward. This included several\nrobberies at the train station, a large group altercation outside a restaurant, a\nfight between two drug users, and a concerning incident of a woman who was\nfollowed from the station and robbed. There were also two incidents of arson,\nof a bin and of a Ford transit. A ULEZ camera was deliberately damaged.\nThere was an incident where a drug user was searched and a knife, and bladed\narticles, were found to be in his possession.\nThere was a disturbing incident of an anti-semitic symbol being daubed on a\nwall outside the synagogue in Cedar Road. There had been a succession of\nincidents related to a woman living in Cedar Road who had engaged in anti-\nsocial activities that had attracted a community of drug users to her premises.\nThis was now the subject of police reports to the DPS that were expected to\nlead to her being charged with serious offences.\nSPEEDING\nThe police had been conducting a programme of visits to local care homes and\nsheltered housing to talk about scams. Residents had raised with them\nconcerns about speeding in Cavendish Road, which had led to police action in\nthat road. There was a discussion of speeding in local roads including\nChalgrove Road, Langley Park Road, The Ridgway and Cavendish Road. The\npolice had been carrying out speed checks in Chalgrove Road and Cavendish\nRoad. The action in Cavendish Road had led to twelve drivers receiving\nwarnings. The police would consider further action against speeding in local\nroads, subject to resources.\nOTHER MATTERS DISCUSSED\nStaffing levels: There should be in theory be a third officer on the Ward to\nsupport Robyn and Helen, but they were coping.\nThe number of “extractions” when they were called away to join police\nexercises elsewhere in London, or at the Croydon custody suite, remained an\nissue of concern but was now running close to 35% of their time rather than\nthe 50% it had once been.\nMention was made of local concern about a story that a body had been\ndiscovered at a house in Egmont Road. The police assured the meeting that\nthere was no wider implication of this incident.\nThe next meeting was tentatively scheduled for Wednesday 14 May at Devonshire Avenue school (7pm) subject to the police checking their work rota.\nThe meeting thanked Robyn for coming back from leave to attend the meeting\nand thanked the officers for their work for the community in dealing with\ncrime in the Ward. The meeting thanked Fiona Ostler for letting us meet at the school. The date of the next meeting was provisionally set as Wednesday 14 May, at Devonshire Avenue primary school and thought continues to be given to what could be done to better publicise the meeting and get a better attendance.\nSUPPORTING THE POLICE CADETS\nSutton South Councillors were concerned to learn about changes proposed to the organisation of the Police Cadets, who meet at a school in our ward. Currently there are over 120 cadets. However, the decision has been made to close junior cadets and cut the remaining senior cadets to just 46. Their future programme is also being severely curtailed. This will have a major impact on the youth of this borough who will no longer have the opportunity to participate in activities such as camps, parades and Duke of Edinburgh awards.\nCouncillor Louise Phelan, whose son has been a Cadet, commented “I’ve seen first-hand the benefits of being part of police cadets. They learn valuable life skills, and gain self confidence. They also support the local community and get to take part in things they wouldn’t otherwise have had the opportunity to do. For many this is a stepping stone into a career within the police force, for others the Cadets help to keep them on the right path and make better life decisions. I am incredibly concerned others will now not get these opportunities.”\nKINGS LANE\nRichard has been trying to get Network Rail to cut back the vegetation on the railway bank adjacent to the southern bridge in Kings Lane as it obscures sight lines for motorists. Every autumn, after the vegetation on the railway bank has grown up, he has this correspondence with Network Rail. They have now cut back the undergrowth sufficiently for cars to be able to see if there are vehicles coming towards them across the bridge.\nMORE APPLICATIONS FOR EXTRA STOREYS\nThe owners of Harrow Lodge, 28 Eaton Road, have used a device known as “Prior Approval” to obtain planning permission to extend the building – adding a storey to the top of the building, with some other changes. This will add 10 new flats to the building. In Mulgrave Road the owners of The Rowans, 47 Mulgrave Road, have similarly obtained planning application to add 8 new flats by adding two storeys to the top of the building. This is a current trend – to add extra storeys to the top of blocks of flats.\nThe applicants both used a device in national planning law known as “Prior Approval” which means that Councillors cannot take the application to the Council’s Planning Committee. We consider that this procedure was introduced to undermine the planning system and reduce local control of planning decisions. We are not able to stop these changes taking place as the system means the application has to be assessed by Council officers against a narrow set of criteria and if the application is refused the Planning Inspectorate, based in Bristol, has the power to over-ride local decisions.\nAs your local Councillors, we are concerned about these developments. While there is a need for more accommodation, these changes will involve building work that will impact on residents. However we seek to ensure that conditions are stipulated in any planning permission, if it is granted, to protect the peace and quiet of the residents during construction work. These include that access to the roof should be via an external hoist, the interior of the building should not be a storage area or building site, there should be a construction management plan, the contractors should join the Considerate Contractors’ Scheme, and there should be a liaison officer residents can contact. If scaffolding is erected it should only be erected when needed and removed as soon as it is not needed.\nA similar application for extra storeys on the roof of the building at Chelsea Court in Mulgrave Road was turned down on the basis of our representations that it would have made the building look incongruous.\nWe welcome feedback on your views on planning proposals. You can see the details of and comment on planning applications via the Sutton Council website (go to the section on planning) or comment by post to\nDevelopment Management, Civic Offices, St Nicholas Way, Sutton, SM1 1EA.\nNOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR SUTTON: PLANNING APPLICATION IN MULGRAVE ROAD TURNED DOWN\nThe owner of Chelsea Court, 54 Mulgrave Road has had planning permission to extend the building – in effect adding two extra floors to the block of flats – refused by Sutton Council. This was the latest in a series of applications in our Ward where owners of blocks of flats have sought to extend the building upwards.\nAs local Councillors, we were concerned about these proposals. While there is a need for more accommodation, the changes to the building would in our view make it look incongruous, not good enough for Sutton. The block is an attractive architect-designed building (see photo), one of the more attractive blocks in Mulgrave Road, and the proposed changes would destroy the symmetry of the building. The Planning Department at Sutton Council agreed with our objections. The changes would also have involved building work that would greatly disturb the current residents of the block.\nThe owners used a mechanism called “prior approval” when submitting their planning application. This mechanism, in our view, was introduced by the Government to undermine the planning system. As a result, we could take the application to the Council’s Planning Committee, which Richard chairs, for decision by Councillors. We may still not be able to stop these changes taking place given the powers of the remote Planning Inspectorate based in Bristol to over-ride local decisions.\nWe always seek to ensure in such cases that a number of conditions are stipulated in any planning permission, if one is ever granted, to try to protect the peace and quiet of the building during construction work. These include that access to the roof should be via an external hoist with all materials for work on the roof transported to the roof by an external hoist and not brought up via the well of the building. The interior of the building should not be a storage area or building site. There should be a construction management plan to minimize disruption to existing residents and ensure there are controls on dust and noise, and on hours of work. The contractors should join the Considerate Contractors’ Scheme. There should be a liaison officer that residents can contact if they observe poor behaviour. If scaffolding is erected outside residents’ windows it should only be erected when needed and removed as soon as it is not needed.\nWe have successfully opposed this development but wait to see if the developer will appeal to the Planning Inspectorate against the decision of the Council.\nA VISIT TO CITY HALL TO PRESENT SUTTON’S PETITION OPPOSING THE EXTENSION OF ULEZ\nLouise, Richard and Trish travelled to City Hall, the HQ of London Mayor Sadiq Khan, on 30 June to join other Sutton Liberal Democrat Councillors in presenting a petition to the Mayor. The petition, signed by over 10 000 Sutton residents, expressed our opposition to the extension of the ULEZ zone to outer London boroughs. Our views on why we opposed the extension of ULEZ can be found in posts further down this site.\nDespite our opposition, ULEZ has now been extended by the London Mayor to outer London.\nFURTHER PROPOSALS FOR NORTHUMBERLAND HOUSE\nWe are again involved in arguments over proposals to add extra storeys the top of Northumberland House.\nNorthumberland House is the tower block at the corner of Brighton Road and Wellesley Road, about 200 yards along Brighton Road if you turn left when coming out of Sutton station.\nCriterion Capital, the owners of Northumberland House, are again seeking planning permission to add two storeys to the top of the building. The owners are again seeking to extend the building, creating a further 29 flats by adding two extra storeys on the top of the ten storey part of the building and an extra storey on the lower part, with some additional flats in the “undercroft” above the parking area. Some of the current parking spaces would be lost.\nAn earlier similar application was not supported by Sutton Council on the basis of design of the proposed tower extension and issues about the alignment of the windows. Planning law allows developers to seek to over-ride the decisions of local Councillors by appealing to the remote Bristol-based Planning Inspectorate, whose decision is final. The developers went to appeal, to the Planning Inspectorate, and on 5 October Richard and Louise attended and spoke on behalf of residents at a hearing organised by the Planning Inspectorate.\nWe had noted that there would be some positives, such as the creation of a community amenity and play space on the tarmaced area at ground floor level. However, while there is a shortage of accommodation in London and more housing is needed, we were concerned that the building work had the potential to be extremely disruptive to the lives of current residents. And an extra two storeys on the top of the building looks incongruous and out of keeping with the design of the rest of the building. Richard told the Inspector the design “looked like a couple of portacabins had been dumped on the top of the building.” At the hearing we told the Planning Inspector that residents of Northumberland House are concerned about the likely disruption involved in this proposed work, and have long standing concerns about frequent lift breakdowns in the building and the general standard of housekeeping, particularly in the bin area. We pressed the Inspector to impose conditions, if he were to agree to the scheme, to protect the interests of residents, and include these conditions in any planning permission they eventually obtained. We asked that access to the roof areas would be only by external hoists, and that the peace and quiet of the interior of the building would not be disturbed or the interior turned into a storage area, or building site. We sought controls on scaffolding to ensure any scaffolding that is required is removed as soon as the requirement has passed. We insisted there must be a construction management plan to control hours of work and control noise and dust nuisance. We asked that the contractor joins the “Considerate Contractors Scheme”, which provides a route for residents to raise concerns if they observe poor behaviour. We were pleased that the developers indicated they would accept all these conditions.\nThe Inspector supported our views and commented that the proposed building looks “incongruous” – the exact wording Richard had used at the hearing. He turned down the application and also refused the application for costs.\nThe owners have now submitted a further, similar application. Residents can see the proposals via the Council’s website (go to the section on planning and follow leads to get to comment on planning applications). It is application DM2023/00796. We are keen to learn of the views of residents on this matter, particularly those who live in Northumberland House. Do contact us at the email addresses given in the first post on this site.\nTACKLING GRAFFITI IN SUTTON SOUTH WARD\nThis picture shows Louise and Trish cleaning off the graffiti we found in the area outside Northumberland House in Brighton Road. We want residents to report to us instances of graffiti, which is one of the scourges of our times, worldwide. In general, the Council has a good record in cleaning off graffiti quickly. A difficulty is when the graffiti is on private property and the owners of the property have responsibility.\nHere is an example of graffiti we got cleaned off, on the bridge at Kings Lane.",

Sutton has done well to cope with the increased demand for primary school places. The bulge is now working its way through to secondary schools. Hence the need for Overton Grange school (the only secondary school in our Ward) to expand, and the need for a new school.\nSutton is doing well. It has the third-highest first-preference rate for secondary school places in London, with almost 80 per cent of local families receiving their first choice of school for their child – well above the London average of 68.52 per cent.\nSutton has once again achieved one of the best rates overall, with the percentage of families receiving one of their top-three preferences increasing to 94.5 per cent – up 1.5 per cent from 2015 and almost six percentage points above the London average of 88.64 per cent.\nParents in the borough have been told which secondary schools have made offers of places for their children for the September 2016 intake.\nIn September, these children will start at our secondary schools, officially ranked as being among the best in England for teaching and exam results. In 2015, the proportion of Sutton students scoring 5 or more A* to C grades including English and Maths was 76.9 per cent, well above the 2014 national average of 53.4 per cent. Across the borough, 83.5 per cent of pupils achieved five or more GCSEs.\nAlmost two-thirds (65.1 per cent) of students across the borough achieved the highest A-Level A*, A and B grades in 2015 and the percentage of Sutton students achieving an A-Level pass grade (A* to E) increased to 99.7 per cent from 98.5 per cent in 2014. This was well above the UK average.",

No indication was given as to why Councillor McManus, previously a member of the committee, had resigned. Matters discussed included:\n– we heard an interesting presentation on the work of the parks police, who are diligent in pursuing and preventing anti-social behaviour in our parks\n– we agreed to set in chain consultation on an action plan to improve Overton Park\n– we confirmed decisions to install speed awareness signs in Cedar Road, which is notorious for speeding, to complement those in Farm Road and those planned for Grange Road and Worcester Road\n– we noted a number of improvements to Sutton South Ward, including re-painting of the railings at two places in Brighton Road and the modification of the width restriction at Grange Vale.",
  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_category_local-issues_page_11/content_251.html": "Every two years Sutton Council has commissioned the polling organisation MORI to undertake an independent in-depth research survey into the attitudes of people who live in Sutton, to help us understand what people like and dislike, and thus improve services.\nThe full results will appear soon on the Council’s website (www.sutton.gov.uk) but we have seen a digest of the results and would welcome any feedback from local residents on your reactions.\nThe results that particularly struck us are:\n* Sutton residents have a high level of satisfaction with Sutton as a place to live, 91% being satisfied (11 points higher than the national average), with the proportion “very satisfied” increasing from 25% to 36% since the last survey in 2009. This is in line with recent surveys that concluded that Sutton is the best place in London to bring up children, taking account of factors such as our good schools, good transport links and low crime rate\n* the issues that most concern residents in Sutton are parking, dog fouling and speeding traffic, these scoring above issues such as litter, vandalism and graffiti. There is sharply increasing concern about dog fouling, which reflects our experience in terms of issues residents raise with us as Councillors. Parking is also an issue of concern though these concerns take different forms – in roads like Eastleigh Close and Bonchurch Close it concerns difficulty in finding a parking space nearby for one’s own car, in some other roads it is a concern about commuter parking in the road. In Sutton South Ward, there is definately a concern about litter, but vandalism and graffiti are less of a problem locally\n* almost three in four (73%) are satisfied with the services of Sutton Council, higher than the national figure. There appears to be a strongly positive attitude to services such as parks and open spaces, street lighting, street cleaning, refuse collection and playgrounds, less strongly positive (though still positive) attitudes to pavement and road maintenance, and to parking services\n* a concern emerges from the survey about how well Sutton Council keeps people informed\n* although Sutton is a low crime area compared to other parts of London and 96% of residents feel safe walking outside in their neighbourhood alone during the day, this proportion drops to 62% after dark, and residents are increasingly concerned about anti-social behaviour and burglary or theft\n* a quarter of Sutton’s residents volunteer regularly and 81% think Sutton is an area where people from different backgrounds get on well together.\nIt should be noted is that, overall, people feel less well-off than when the survey was last undertaken two years ago, with 45% saying their personal financial circumstances have got worse in the last year, as the recession has bitten.\nWe are interested in the views of local people on these issues and would welcome it if readers of this article want to give us their opinion.\nMatters that clearly require attention include:\n– there is a finding that people are less satisfied than one might expect with the information received from the Council. How can we improve on this ?\n– dog fouling has got worse. The problem is a small minority of dog owners. Most are very responsible. Is there any solution ?\nA further study of our local area (covering three Wards – Sutton South, Belmont and Cheam) will be available shortly. The sample size is too small to give results just for Sutton South Ward.",

While we all love the trees, they drop leaves and sap, block light and disturb pavements and front gardens with their roots. A balance has to be struck in keeping their height down, since heavy pollarding of lime trees (for example) leads to them developing many more branches that grow back quickly with larger leaves. Tree pruning policy is governed by a British Standard, and needs to take account of the shaping of the tree. Changes to the Standard in the 1980’s led to some changes in tree pruning policy involving less severe pruning.\nIn 2011 an exercise was carried out to deal with basal growth and low level branches. A more severe pruning programme occurs on a four yearly basis. Richard and Heather were able to get the programme changed so that the pruning programme began in the Ward in November 2011. It is due to conclude by February 2012. It has involved identifying any trees that are diseased and 16 have been taken out. The locations are noted and replacement trees will be provided in due course, but there is a waiting list. The rest are subject to the pruning programme.\nBefore the programme began Richard met Ben Morris, the Council’s Chief arborculturalist, in Sutton South Ward, to discuss the programme. They called on a number of residents who have particular issues with street trees.\nRichard comments “We all love the trees and Sutton is rightly regarded as a green and pleasant Borough. I was pleased we were able to get the pruning programme brought forward. Inevitably the decisions taken by the arborculturalists leave some people complaining that trees near them should be pruned harder or less hard, and in a few locations trees that twere declining or diseased have been lost. But overall this is a programme to maintain the trees that are such an attractive aspect of South Sutton Ward.”",

See the page on this site on “Sutton Police” for information on the Ward police panel.\nNow the Mayor, and the Mayor’s Office for Policing (MOPAC), want to change this, abolishing the Forum and setting up a new set of bodies, Safer Neighbourhood Boards.\nThe Boards will replace existing groups such as our Community and Police Forum, long-standing groups that were established in the 1980’s as a result of the Scarman Report, which identified a collapse in relationships between the police and local communities as contributing to the 1981 Brixton Riots.\nMore worryingly, our South Sutton Ward Panel, where the police discuss crime trends in the Ward with local community groups, will no longer set the policing priorities. This is a backward step.\nPolicing priorities for the Ward – no longer set by the local panel – are burglary, motor vehicle crime and violence with injury. This last priority is not relevant to Sutton South, which is a low crime area with few such crimes. The police have agreed, at the Ward panel meeting on 11 December, to continue action on local priorities such as traffic and speeding.\nWe remain concerned that these changes will not help community / police consultation on crime and policing in our Ward.",

Use the “Report a Problem” button on the website or email us at the address given on the banner at the top of the website.\nDuring the period of cold weather and snowfall, we were contacted by many people in the Ward seeking assistance.\nWe were contacted by a resident in Rutherford Close who commented on the icy state of the pavements in Rutherford Close and in Cumnor Road, as they had to walk the length of Cumnor Road to get a bus in Langley Park Road. We contacted the gritting team who left a pile of grit at each end of Cumnor Road. We went round to Cumnor Road and ourselves distributed grit along the pavements, including gritting the road at the Cumnor Road / Rutherford Close intersection, a part of Wellesley Road and most of Rutherford Close. We were assisted by Courtney and Curtis Sampson of Cumnor Road, to whom we extend thanks.\nThe Council does not have the resources to clear or grit all the pavements in the Borough. After each fall of snow priority is given to pavements outside hospitals, GP surgeries and schools, and care homes. Responding to requests we made, the pavement outside Fiske Court (a large care home in Cavendish Road) was partly cleared, and Councillor Clifton himself cleared a further stretch of the pavement, in response to a request from a resident. It is worth noting that, if there is more snow before the winter ends, if people clear a path outside their own house it will dry off during the periods of thaw when the temperature gets above freezing, and this will leave the pavement clear of ice. Which is why we encourage people to do this.\nThe new grit bins in the Ward have been of value but were rapidly emptied. The gritting teams are continuing to fill them up but they are emptied again almost as soon as they are filled. Which, of course, means they are being used for their intended purpose. Most of the bins in the Ward were re-filled in the period immediately after Christmas.\nResidents of Downside Road have commented to us that the new bin, installed at the request of Councilor Clifton, in the middle of the hill, outside number 31, has been of great value and helped them keep the road open during the snow. This supplements the bins at the top and bottom of the hill.",

Devonshire School’s Parent Teacher Association kept everyone fuelled with cold drinks and home made scones, whilst watching their children have a lot of fun.\nSutton’s Biodiversity Team showed residents how the butterfly survives on kidney vetch, the plant which provides the caterpillar with its food and habitat.\nKidney vetch thrives in Sutton’s chalky, alkaline soil, and Sutton Nature Conservation Volunteers took the names of people and organisations who want to grow the plant in their gardens and allotments to increase the available habitat and provide stepping stones for the butterfly to colonise further areas.\nHere, the Council’s Biodiversity Officer, Jurk Hendryk, explains what the butterflies need to survive.\nCouncillor Heather Honour said: “This event was part of a wider scheme to improve the site, which provides an important green space in an area of our borough which has fewer back gardens. I am so pleased that many different parts of our local community are involved in this project, from Christchurch in the neighbouring road, to the South Sutton Neighbourhood Association (SSNA).

Fun and learning, what better way to spend a Saturday afternoon?”\nThe SSNA has put in a bid for external funds to improve the area and provide a small play facility so local children have somewhere local to play.\nSmall blue butterflies were identified in the late afternoon and there is currently (July) a good display of kidney vetch at the nature area. There will be a demonstration of how to grow it and distribution of seeds later, in early September.\nColin Hall, Executive Member for Environment and Climate Change on Sutton Council, said: “The information day was all about telling residents how to give the butterfly a helping hand by growing the plants that it needs to survive – it’s a great example of the community coming together and boosting biodiversity in its own back yard.”\nFor any enquiries about getting involved with the project contact Councillor Honour on heather.honour@sutton.org.uk or for information about the site or small blue butterfly, please call the Biodiversity Team on 020 8770 5821 or email: biodiversity@sutton.gov.uk.\n[ Devonshire Avenue Nature Area ]",

The full text can be found at the end of this post.\nTo put in your submission email it to teamp2@pins.gsi.gov.uk for the attention of Peter Lyne, Case Officer, quoting Planning Inspectorate reference APP/P5870/A/12/2184339/NWF.\nWe object to the proposal on the grounds that it is overdevelopment of the site, with 50 dwellings crammed in. It is the type of low-quality accommodation that we continue to oppose in our Ward, where there are instances of the Planning Inspectorate overturning local decisions and allowing substantial family houses to be demolished to make way for blocks of small flats without gardens. There are current examples in Eaton Road and Albion Road, sites where building work is currently underway, the proposals rejected by Sutton Council but allowed by the Planning Inspectorate. Half the children in our Ward live in accommodation without access to a garden. There is a shortage of affordable family homes.\nIn addition, the provision for car parking (33 car parking spaces for 50 dwellings) is inadequate and will lead to great pressure on parking, with additional demand for parking in the area.\nOur reasons are, unsurprisingly, almost identical with the reasons given by the Council for rejecting the application.\nOur submission objecting to the proposal was included in the papers that went to the Council’s Development Control Committee on 5 September, and Richard attended the Committee meeting, though he was not called to be a member of the panel of Councillors reaching a decision that evening.\nHERE IS THE FULL TEXT OF OUR SUBMISSION\nFor the attention of Peter Lyne, Case Officer\nPostal Address:\nPeter Lyne\nThe Planning Inspectorate\n3/10 Wing\nTemple Quay House\n2 The Square\nBristol.\nBS1 6PN\nAppeal relating to 54 – 58 Overton Road, Sutton, Surrey, SM2 6RB\nLondon Borough of Sutton Reference B2012/66079/FUL\nPlanning Inspectorate reference APP/P5870/A/12/2184339/NWF\nSUBMISSION\nWe understand this appeal is being determined by written procedure.\nWe would like to comment on this appeal, and ask that our comments are considered by the Inspector.\nWe are elected Councillors for Sutton South Ward in the London Borough of Sutton.\nAlthough the development is not in Sutton South Ward, it is very close to the Ward. The Ward boundary runs down Overton Road in front of the property. Our residents are among those affected by the proposal and objecting to it.\nWe object to the proposal on the grounds, first, that it is overdevelopment of the site, with 50 dwellings crammed in. It is the type of low-quality accommodation that we continue to oppose in our own Ward, where there are many instances of substantial family houses being demolished to make way for blocks of small flats without gardens. Half the children at the one primary school in our Ward live in accommodation without access to a garden. There are a lot of small flats but a shortage of affordable family homes. Couples who live in the flats in the Ward often find that when they have children, and the flat is too small, they cannot find a home they can afford in the area so have to move away.\nSecond, the provision for car parking (33 car parking spaces for 50 dwellings) is inadequate and will lead to great pressure on parking, with additional demand for parking in an area that is already fully parked up much of the time.\nOur reasons are almost identical with the reasons given by the Council for rejecting the application.\nWe note that there is to be a site visit. We would like to be advised of the date and given opportunity to attend.\nWe would like to be informed of the outcome of the appeal when it is determined.

Berridge was an engineer who travelled the world and contributed to many important civil engineering projects worldwide, including the building of tunnels under the river Hudson in New York in 1902 and the development of the port of Aden – in modern day Yemen – in the ensuing decade. He settled in Sutton in the 1920’s to work on housing development for the London County Council. He is noted in civil engineering circles as the inventor of equipment for the testing of concrete, based on principles which are still relevant to modern day equipment used for this purpose.\nTrish said “We favour naming roads after celebrated local people and think it is appropriate to name this road after an interesting and distinguished man who once lived here, and made a significant contribution to civil engineering.”\nHarold Berridge was born in 1872 and went to the City of London school. After serving a pupilage in civil engineering from 1890 to 1893 he became the resident engineer at Poole Harbour in 1893.\nAfter working as an engineer for companies including John Mowlem & Co. and the City and South London Railway in the period to 1898, he became Assistant Superintendent supervising the approaches to the Hudson Tunnel, in New York, in 1902, before becoming Chief Engineer to the Aden Port Trust in 1904. He was involved in work in Aden through to 1924, after which he worked on housing development schemes for the London County Council through to 1931. During his time in Aden he was awarded the OBE.\nThe Times of 20 June 1949 reports his death, on 17 June 1949, at 8 Worcester Gardens, Sutton, Surrey. Worcester Gardens stood on the site now occupied by the Subsea7 building in Brighton Road, and was a turning off the Brighton Road. Berridge lived in a Victorian house in Worcester Gardens.\nBerridge is remembered for his patents relating to principles and equipment for the testing of concrete, including one dating from 1925 under the title “Contractible and expansible supporting means suitable for use in the construction of pipes, tunnels, bridges and other bodies or structures.” In 1932 he submitted an important patent entitled ”Apparatus for Testing the Strength of Materials.” His equipment for the testing of concrete was based on principles which are still relevant to modern day equipment used for this purpose.",

They persuaded the office to limit the hours sought so that it did not extend into the evenings.\nThe office was happy to do this as they are closed in the evening. It seems the application for a licence in the evening was a mistake. They want to be able to provide the happy couple at the weddings they conduct with a glass of champagne. These weddings are always daytime events.\nRichard spoke at the hearing on the licence application. This is his speech:\n“The task of the committee is to satisfy itself that two very important objectives can be achieved simultaneously. There is no reason why they cannot be.\nThese are:\nFirst, the Registrar’s Office should be able to properly perform the important functions it discharges for the residents of Sutton, in a world where (I accept) the expectations of the community as to how these functions are discharged has changed a little.\nSecond, the Office should be a good neighbour and not disturb the peace and quiet of the residential area where it is situated.\nI would like to say a word about each of these objectives.\nThe Registrar’s Office has been in Worcester Road for over 50 years and its functions have changed little over time. I have been to weddings at the office, as a guest, to meetings and conferences there, and to Citizenship Ceremonies. During my year as Mayor I attended these every week to make a speech of welcome to new citizens. The importance of these functions to those who take part needs to be recognised. The day you get married, the day you take British citizenship, these are massive moments in life that stay in the memory and I know the office does all it can to ensure these are happy events. I have been to these events and found champagne is being served when it has been brought by the happy couple or, very occasionally, the new citizen. I think it quite appropriate that a glass of champagne should be available at these events. Those involved all want to make this a happy day and there is no reason atall to suppose that this will lead to disorder in the context of these carefully organised and conducted ceremonies. In fact, there is more of an element of control if champagne is being provided in a managed way rather than people bringing their own.\nOn the second objective, the expectations of the Councillors and the residents is that the Office will continue to be a good neighbour. That is vital and I am pleased the Office has emphasised its commitment to do this. I am pleased with the assurances that have been given about a limit on the supply of champagne and how these events will continue to be carefully organised. The changes the Office have made to the application to limit the hours and to daytime are, of course, of massive importance and re-assurance.\nThere was no reason why the licence should extend into the evening. These weddings are daytime events and the office is normally closed in the evening.\nI think it important this hearing today had taken place so we can get these assurances from the Office. The officers who run the Registrar’s Office know that were there to be any disorder and disturbance to local residents in the future, the Councillors and their employers would be immediately investigating. I very much hope the Office will continue to discharge these very important functions – which bring happiness to those who take part are are important, memorable days in their lives – without any undue disturbance to the neighbourhood beyond what has happened for the many years the Office has been in Worcester Road. “",

Here is the text:\n“Sir\nAt the meeting of Sutton Council on 19 January Richard criticised the owners of Sutherland House for their “inertia” in relation to the re-development of the empty building.\nRichard joined with Sutton Councillor Hanna Zuchowska in pointing out that the owners withdrew an application for planning permission that included an element of affordable housing before exploiting recent changes in planning law to get permission for conversion of the building to 128 luxury flats with no affordable housing element. But still, although the building has been empty for five years, they do not get on with the re-development.\nSpeaking after the meeting Richard said “The building is still empty and a blot on the landscape. The development of the Subsea7 building, bringing 800 office jobs to the area, and the improvements associated with the Sutton Gateway project, are giving a lift to the area just south of Sutton station. We need the developers to get on with the renovation of Sutherland House.”\nThe full text of Richard’s speech, seconding a motion on affordable housing, is as follows:\n“In seconding this motion, I would like to draw attention to the opening sentence, which speaks of the widening gap between the rich and the poor.\nI find it astonishing that in my own lifetime the wealth gap between rich and poor has not just failed to diminish but has actually widened.\nThe figures are so astounding one hardly believes them – that the top 80 (eight zero) wealthiest individuals in the world own more than half the world’s wealth, that is they own as much as half the population of the planet.\nAnd in our own country about 30 billionaires own half the wealth of the nation.\nAnd the implications of this inequality are not just a matter of concern for social policy.\nA fascinating study published by the OECD last December showed that countries with a smaller and narrowing gap between rich and poor experienced higher rates of economic growth, and if the gap between rich and poor had not widened in Britain from the 1980’s the UK economy would in fact be 20% larger.\nGeorge Osborne ought to reflect on the reasons for this. If you increase the earnings of the poor they will spend it, creating income, jobs and wealth for others, but if you increase the earnings of the rich they may save much of it. He ought to remember this when he plans yet further raids on the welfare budget, on financial support to the very poorest in society, rather than asking the wealthy to contribute more.\nIt is a finding that demonstrates that the so-called “trickledown” economics so beloved of leaders on the right of the political spectrum – and that included Margaret Thatcher – whereby largesse afforded to the very rich trickled down to help the very poor, was in fact a recipe for lower growth and thus a lower increase in living standards for all.\nWe need concerted policy action to deal with this, and tax rates on the highest earners, property taxes, the minimum wage, and welfare support to the very poor, are all important aspects. But we all know that action and support for those in need can be best targeted if undertaken at a local level.\nHere in Sutton, we will continue to do what we can to build a fairer and more equal society, something of particular importance to us as Liberal Democrats, even if what we can do is sometimes at the most basic level, such as dealing with concerns about food and housing.\nAnd the fact that we have Food Banks, here in Britain, in one of the more affluent countries in the world, makes my point about inequality more eloquently than any of my words can do.\nOn housing, we can be proud of our record in Sutton.\nAs Councillor McCoy told us, the Council is promoting affordable housing, something that is vital when I find that in my own Ward changes to planning law mean that a block like Sutherland House can become 128 luxury flats with no affordable housing requirement atall. If and when the developers finally get on with it, and I deplore their inertia.\nAnd the Council is dealing with homelessness: I was heartened by the serious and concerned tone of the debate at Planning Committee on the proposal to provide short-term accommodation for homeless families in Benhill Road. It was the Committee at its best. This was on an evening – 17 December 2014 – when no less than 76 (seven six) Sutton families were homeless and in bed and breakfast accommodation, often miles from Sutton.\nMr. Mayor, we must continue our efforts as a Council to care for the most needy of our residents, while having a concern – as citizens – to promote policies, at every level, that will increase economic growth but distribute the rewards more fairly.\nI am pleased to second the motion.”",

We all see evidence of the difficult times the economy as a whole is going through, including empty retail outlets.\nYou might therefore be interested in the analysis below, taken from figures presented to the meeting held on 12 September of the Council’s Economic Development Advisory Group, of which Richard is member.\nThe figures show that Sutton has a vibrant local economy which is surviving the recession well. Data for the quarter to June 2011 show:\n• Sutton has the highest economic activity rate of any Borough in London . There are 106,500 economically active residents in the Borough, with an economic activity rate of 82.3% compared to 74.8% for London as a whole\n• The number of long-term unemployed in Sutton is falling, with the figures for June down 15% on the previous year\n• The volume of house sales and the number of planning applications (both important indicators of activity) have been rising, in the case of house sales by over 20% on the previous year’s figures. House prices have however fallen, by 2.8% on the figures for this time last year\n• The number of businesses going into administration has decreased. Business failures are of course compensated for by new local business start-ups and established companies moving into the area, on which data is less reliable\n• The percentage of vacant properties in the borough has decreased.\nThe conclusion is that Sutton is weathering the recession well. People in Sutton find it easier to find work than is the case elsewhere, and Sutton is an attractive centre for inward investment that brings development and jobs. It thus remains a growing and successful London Borough and, despite the current economic climate, is one of the most attractive places to live in the country, with good transport links to central London and beyond, plenty of green space, good leisure facilities and some of the best performing schools in the country.\nTransport links are of course vitally important to our attractiveness to investors. They also are important to the people of Sutton, many of whom commute to central London. For this reason, the threat to terminate the Capital Connect (Thameslink) services at Blackfriars, so they do not run further north of the river, is something we are personally committed to fighting.

The plans were made public at a meeting on Thursday 23 May attended by Councillors, local business leaders and the Under Secretary of State for Transport, Norman Baker MP, who was at the launch event to give the project his backing. .\nThe planned route would run from the existing Tramlink Croydon-Wimbledon line at Merton through Rosehill and St Helier, Angel Hill, and Sutton High Street to a terminal at Sutton station. A later second phase would link the town centre to the Royal Marsden Hospital.\nThe tram connection would cut local journey times and costs, reduce pollution on the streets of Sutton and help regenerate areas such as the St Helier Estate by encouraging investment, improving access and widening the job market in the areas concerned.\nThe extension through our Ward to the Marsden hospital would be of importance as it is expected that the development of a research centre at the Marsden will create many local jobs.\nThe Tramlink is a major plank in the “Opprtunity Sutton” programme, which Richard is closely involved with as vice-chair of the Housing, Economy and Business Committee.",

Recently there have been a number of planning applications for sites in our Ward, including in Cavendish Road, Langley Park Road and Downside Road, that the Council’s planning officers have, rightly, turned down.\nThese have included proposals for house extensions that would close the visual gap between houses, causing harm to the spacious and open character of most of the roads in our Ward, and proposals for blocks of flats whose height, bulk, mass and design would constitute an unsympathetic form of development and have a detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the area. Applications have also been turned down where at least some affordable housing ought to be provided, to promote mixed and balanced communities.\nWe are concerned that developments should relate sympathetically to the street scene and the local area. We have also objected to the way the Planning Inspectorate in Bristol sometimes over-rules democratic local decisions, leading to inappropriate development.\nA post below describes the concerns in Cavendish Road. In Langley Park Road a proposal for a block of flats was turned down because the proposed development would result in an incongruous layout and unduly prominent development, excessive in scale, bulk and width, with an overly dominant parking area to the front out of keeping with the existing development pattern in the locality, thus detrimental to the character and appearance of the area and the street scene. It would by virtue of its siting and height result in an unacceptable impact on the outlook of the neighbouring occupiers, and would be detrimental to the health of significant trees affected by the development.\nIn Downside Road a proposal for erection of a two storey side/rear extension was turned down by the Council. The grounds were:\n- The proposal would uncharacteristically close the visual gap between the application site and the adjoining neighbour causing significant and unacceptable harm to the spacious and open character of Downside Road and resulting in a visual terracing impact on the street scene contrary to planning policies.\n- The proposal, by reason of its lack of a setback from the shared side boundary and excessively narrow garage, would result in a contrived appearance that would fail to relate sympathetically and subordinately to the original dwelling and cause harm to the street scene and the local area contrary to planning policies.",

He said:\n“We all know the importance to Sutton of maintaining a through rail service to north London.\nI want to stress the importance of links to St Pancras International as St Pancras develops further as an international rail hub.\nOver the next few years there will be a positive mushrooming of international rail travel from London. If the current plans of Deutschbahn and Eurostar come to fruition, by 2014 it will be possible, on arriving at St Pancras, to have a choice of services to travel from London to Amsterdam.\nIn addition to the current services to Brussels and Paris there will also be services from London to North Germany. This is a big market in terms of business travel. At present, each day, about 30 planes fly from London’s airports to destinations in north Germany, carrying about the same number of people as could be carried by just a few trains, using the Velaro D trains that are being built to provide rolling stock for these new services from London, by the train manufacturer Siemens at its Dusseldorf factory, which in fact I visited recently.\nAside from the potential importance of these international links to the residents of Sutton, there are international companies that have significant centres of their enterprises in Sutton – Sutton, a thriving London suburb, offering office space much cheaper than that found in the centre of London, less than half an hour by train from the centre, with a pleasant ambience and environment, and a location from which – importantly – you can reach the centre of Brussels in just two train journeys, one taking about 40 minutes and one about 2 hours. And the centre of Paris in just 15 minutes more. And soon – Amsterdam, north Germany.\nNow, these are transport links that it is vital for Sutton to maintain, for the sake of our residents but also to maintain our attractiveness as a centre for business development. When I look at the data on economic activity that comes regularly to the new Housing, Economy and Business committee, some clear conclusions stand out. It is clear that Sutton is doing relatively well in terms of surviving the recession and maintaining one of the highest rates of economic activity on the part of its residents of any part of London. But we need to continue to attract new businesses.\nThe Tramlink extension is perhaps equally important, particularly in relation to the north Sutton site, which is an attractive site, and on which the Housing, Economy and Business committee now has a task group working on the planning brief. Our current plans include scope for a Tramlink stop at the site, something that will greatly enhance its appeal, and we see this development as an important part of our future growth strategy.\nSo we must keep pressure on TfL to continue work on the feasibility of the Sutton Tramlink proposal, and make clear to the Department for Transport that changes that remove our linoks to north London and in particular to St Pancras, are not acceptable.\nThe Thameslink service is absolutely vital. Losing it would sever our only direct link to North London and would mean Sutton residents would need to take at least two trains to get to St Pancras. It is quite scandalous that, at a time when we should be improving public transport, there is a serious proposal to cut the link between North and South London.”\nWe need to act now as the Department for Transport is currently consulting on the new seven-year Thameslink franchise which will run from September next year and incorporate the Southern franchise from 2015.\nIronically, the cross-London Loop Line service which runs through Sutton, Carshalton and Hackbridge stations, was recently reopened at nights and weekends after being split for three and a half years by engineering work. It is all very well reopening it now, but Sutton’s residents need the line to stay open for good.\nThe new franchise will set service patterns for 2018 and beyond, so it is vital that we act now and do not become a Cinderella area for rail transport.\nTo view the DfT consultation document visit www.dft.gov.uk/consultations\nTo give your input into Sutton’s response, email alex.forrest@sutton.gov.uk\nRichard and Heather will be submitting their own response.\nMore detail about the attitude the Council is taking, opposing this threat, is in a further post on this site “Train Links To North London Must Remain” (see archive July 2011).\nHeather and Richard outside Sutton station",

There are three other buildings in our Ward that are listed on the Local List of structures of local importance, which provides a lesser degree of protection. These are:\n- the Registrar’s office (The Russetings) in Worcester Road, a Victorian house that it is believed the Walls family, famous for Walls ice cream and Walls sausages, lived in, though this is disputed\n- Stowford in Brighton Road, a Victorian house, now the Eagle House school\n- the pavilion of the Highfield Lawns tennis club at the junction of Mayfield Road and The Ridgway, as an example of an Edwardian tennis pavilion, build by local builder Percy Vere Windebank in 1908\nThese Drain Pressure Release Pipes, also known as ‘Stink Pipes’, can be seen at various locations within the old Carshalton Urban District Council boundary. They have been listed on the basis of the criterion that they are important to the townscape view.\nThey were produced by W. Macfarlane & Co. of Glasgow, a prestigous Victorian Ironworks. The company employed imaginative designers and produced huge amounts of ornate and decorative ironwork. The pipes are extremely tall with an ornate top fixture comprising a large arrow, a globe with four trumpetlike funnels and a spike spire piercing a crown. The height and funnels may be to ensure the gas disperses efficiently so as not to inconvenience local residents. It is not known what purpose the arrow has, whether to indicate the direction of sewer flow or act as a weather vane to indicate wind direction.\nThey serve two purposes, firstly to prevent a build up of pressure in underground sewers in the event of a blockage, and secondly to vent off any hydrogen sulphide gas. This gas, which smells of rotten eggs, can build up when sewage becomes septic, on long runs, or when the speed of the sewage is slow in flat areas. It is extremely corrosive and can eat through the concrete pipes. The sewerage system would have become a necessity after the rapid increases in population and residences in Sutton and Carshalton at the end of the 1800s. Prior to this sewage would have been dispersed into cesspits and drainage ditches, with a risk of contamination of the drinking water supply, contributing to ill health.\nThe history of W. Macfarlane and Co. and their foundry, the Saracen Foundry, is fascinating. In 1851 Walter Macfarlane (1817-1885) established his company in a disused foundry in Saracen Lane in Gallowgate, Glasgow, and named it Saracen Foundry. It later moved to Washington Street, near the River Clyde. By 1872 his nephew, also named Walter MacFarlane (1853–1932), joined the rapidly expanding company and they relocated to Possilpark, a site of 100 acres on the outskirts of the city. Here a foundry with railway access and a village-styled infrastructure to house the workforce was built. In a decade it housed 10,000 people but the vast iron-founding site caused much pollution. The young MacFarlane made standardisation and good design the key to the company’s successful development. The foundry’s work was used on prestigous developments and widely distributed. During the Second World War Possilpark industrial works was a vast and well-lit target for attack. The recovery of iron to melt down for the war effort also removed much of Saracen’s work. After the war, the collapse of the British Empire, the move away from steam power and the use of new designs and materials led to a vast decline in orders. In 1967 the foundry at Possilpark closed.",

To ensure a consistent approach throughout the Borough, all local schemes will be drawn into a central strategy and progressed on the basis of an assessment of priorities.\nAn ambitious scheme for the introduction of a 20mph scheme across most of the area of Sutton South Ward west of the Sutton to Belmont railway line has now been included in the “Local Implementation Plan” prepared by Transport for London. This was the subject of proposals put to the local committee in 2015. However, it is on the “reserve list” which means that implementation in the near future is most unlikely.\nA parking scheme for the newly-named Berridge Close is agreed, implementation to coincide with the opening of the adjacent Subsea7 building, as this will lead to more intensive use of the road by those working in the building and accessing the underground car park. Obstructive parking in Berridge Close could lead to problems when the building is occupied, so needs to be avoided. It is proposed that the road will be included in the controlled parking zone with four parking bays in the road, reserved for residents with parking permits. Completion of the building is unlikely before December.\nTraffic and parking schemes were the subject of a session at the December 2015 meeting of the South Sutton, Cheam and Belmont Local Committee, when residents noted down parking and traffic problems. A list of the proposals raised by residents was reported back to the local committee meeting on 10 March.\nIn relation to our own area, the proposals fell into three main categories.\nFirst, concerns about intensive and sometimes obstructive parking in Mayfield Road and roads nearby (The Ridgway, Chalgrove Road, Upland Road).\nSecond, concerns about visibility at the Farm Road / The Ridgway junction.\nThird, a set of other concerns, mostly about speeding at various locations.\nThis listing will form the agenda for further work by the traffic department within a wider cross-Borough study, which is centrally managed by the Council. A number of minor, initial proposals were agreed on 10 March, including to restrict parking at the Prior Avenue / Banstead Road junction due to visibility issues.\nThe question of a parking control scheme in Mayfield Road and the surrounding area was the subject of a consultation exercise by local Councillors last year which showed support in Mayfield Road but not adjacent roads. On 10 March the local committee agreed to devote some of its public realm funds to fund the traffic department to “kick start” a study of potential for parking controls in this area. A discussion between traffic engineers and Ward Councillors to consider this study was held on 8 June in Mayfield Road. The traffic engineers will design a parking control scheme for consultation. The precise parameters of this scheme and the consultation have yet to be finalised. Consultation with residents is due to begin in January 2017.\nSome residents of Audley Place have commented to us that there is difficulty when driving out of Audley Place in seeing vehicles coming down Camborne Road, if cars are parked close to the corner. We raised this issue with traffic engineers and the Council is proposing a small extension of the yellow lines on each side at the exit from Audley Place. We think this will do the trick in terms of making it easier, and safer, to drive out into Camborne Road.\nResidents of Tapestry Close have complained to us about obstructive parking in the Close. We raised this issue with traffic engineers and a scheme of yellow lining was proposed. Further consultation with residents, required by law, found some residents objecting and this scheme is currently on hold.\nSeveral schemes consulted on some time ago have now been implemented, including yellow lining at the bottom of Downside Road to deal with obstructive parking (see photo above) and switching some “pay and display” bays to “dual use” so residents with parking permits can use them, in Grange Road and Langley Park Road.",

The ceremony was attended by Trish and other Councillors, including the Leader of Sutton Council, Councillor Dombey.\nSubsea7 are an offshore exploration and technical support company, and they had brought one of their submarines from Aberdeen to the building to show it to guests. Paul Rosier, of Subsea7, gave the audience a potted history of the site, including information on the famous people who had once lived on the site. These included the famous engineer Harold Berridge, who invented techniques for measuring the strength of concrete, after whom the adjacent road has been named Berridge Close.\nSubsea7 had considered re-locating from Sutton to an adjacent Borough, but their staff were keen to remain in Sutton. They wanted a purpose-built new office building and purchased the site in order to build an HQ to their own design. They have closed their office in Hammersmith to concentrate their staff in Sutton, and will eventually expand to employ up to 900 staff at the site.\nIn opening the building Richard said “This is great moment for Sutton. This is one of the most attractive new buildings in our town and the decision of Subsea7 to locate their headquarters here will be of massive benefit to the local economy, bringing jobs and prosperity to local shops, restaurants and hotels. As a Councillor for this Ward, I have supported this project throughout.”\nThe Mayoral party",

These are people from all over the world who share a desire to be British citizens, and have taken examinations in the English language and in our history and way of life to obtain citizenship. On 16 December there were people from Iraq, Sri Lanka, India, Hong Kong and Rwanda. On 10 November there were people from Ethiopia, India, Nigeria,Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bulgaria, Tunisia, South Africa and Zimbabwe, all of whom had successfully applied for British citizenship. On 8 December there were people from Nepal, Sri Lanka, India, the Ukraine, South Korea, the USA and the Congo.\nRichard says “I find these ceremonies moving. Britain benefits enormously from being a multi-racial society, with so many different cultures learning from each other. These people will be a great credit to Britain, and are enthusiastic about becoming British citizens. They will bring to our country cultures and experiences that we will learn from and which will make Britain a better place.”\nThis is the text of his speech of welcome, elaborating on the standard speech normally made at this ceremony in order to draw particular attention to the many advantages of setting up home in the London Borough of Sutton, and the benefits to Sutton of the skills and experiences that people from such diverse backgrounds bring to our community.\n“It is indeed a great pleasure for me to extend my personal welcome you all, as well as welcoming you on behalf of the London Borough of Sutton and on behalf of the government of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the second.\nI am delighted that you have either chosen Sutton as a place to live or have chosen Sutton to celebrate this very special occasion.\nSutton cherishes its diversity and today we are celebrating this with all of you, people who come from many different parts of the world. You bring with you cultures and experiences which we will value, and which can help to continue to make Sutton a great place to live and to work. You have many opportunities to participate in the local community, in particular by volunteering to help in a wide range of groups and activities where your expertise and experience would be invaluable to the community.\nMany of you have children. Sutton is proud to have excellent schools and opportunities for our young people. We look to inspire young people so they develop and thrive in a learning environment. This year students at Sutton schools achieved the best GCSE results in the country.\nA recent study rated Sutton as the best place in London to bring up children. The study looked at factors such as low crime rates, affordability of houses, earnings and access to good schools, and concluded that Sutton is the best Borough in London to set up home. So, for those of you who have set up home in Sutton, congratulations on making such a wise choice.\nSutton is also the Borough with the highest percentage of residents in work – 78% of Sutton’s working age population has a job, and there is evidence that in this period of recession Sutton remains vibrant.\nThe green spaces and parks in Sutton enable everyone to enjoy their leisure time. Sutton is proud of its “green” environment – having over 1 500 acres of parks and open spaces and over 20 000 street trees. There is also a wide range of other facilities in the Borough such as libraries, theatres, and the Life centre, which encourages citizenship and learning.\nHistorically Sutton has been linked to the Queens and Kings of England. King Henry 8th was frequently a visitor to the Borough having a home in Nonsuch park.\nThis house that we are in today is a fine example of Victorian architecture, once inhabited by the Walls family, a name you may recognise, famous for their Walls Ice Cream and Walls Sausages. But there are many other heritage sites worthy of a visit including Whitehall in Cheam and The Honeywood centre in Carshalton. Since 1965 this building has been the Register office, registering important life events such as births, deaths marriages, civil partnerships and – today – people choosing to take British citizenship.\nAs we look across the world and realise how fortunate we are to live in a democracy, I urge you all as new citizens to use the opportunity to vote in our elections, to shape the future of the Borough and your new country. Your next opportunity to do that will be in May, when we elect a new Mayor of London and a London Assembly.\nMay I congratulate you all and wish you happiness and success as new British Citizens. “\nThis is Richard with the Registrar, who conducted the ceremony.",
  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_category_thameslink-campaign/content_6.html": "On the 27th of January Sutton Council met. Richard raised the issue of the reasons why a recent survey by The Times newspaper ranked Sutton as the eighth most attractive place to live in England. This finding does not surprise us. We spend a lot of time knocking on the doors of our residents to introduce ourselves as your local Councillors and we find people generally say they really like Sutton, mentioning a strong sense of community, open spaces, low crime, good schools, a green and pleasant environment, parks, street trees, being convenient for London and for the countryside. This is particularly the case with people who have moved to Sutton from elsewhere, particularly those from other London boroughs, from Hong Kong and from Ukraine. Please write to us and tell us what you like about Sutton or think we can improve.\nTRISH LEADS THE FIGHT FOR A BETTER TRAIN SERVICE\nMany of our residents commute to London by train, and the combination of good schools, low crime, a green and leafy borough and proximity to local railway stations is what attracts many London commuters to Sutton South Ward.\nFor this reason we are concerned at the reports we get from many residents that the train service is not adequate. Both of us have, at times, been commuters into central London and we know the frustrations. In September Trish made an impassioned speech to Sutton Council on the problems residents have experienced, quoting the stories residents have shared with us of cancelled services and broken down trains. The Council called on the Government to review the franchise of Southern Railway and Govia, and implement stringent penalties for failure to deliver an adequate service.\nSince Richard was elected he has fought successful campaigns to save the Thameslink service and to get the side entrance to Sutton station open. We are now campaigning to get Network Rail to increase the capacity of the station car park. We want to monitor the performance of the railway so please continue to contact us with your thoughts and experiences.\nTHAMESLINK CAMPAIGN SUCCESS\nOur campaign to keep open through trains from Sutton to north London has been a successs. The threat has been removed.\nThe picture above shows Richard and Heather at our “Day of Action” outside Sutton station.\nThe picture below shows Richard, with Councillor Simon Wales, presenting our petition at the Department for Transport last August.\nTHAMESLINK DECISION TO BE REVIEWED\nOur campaign to save the Thameslink loop line and ensure trains from Sutton continue to run direct to the north of London took a step forward when Sutton Councillors were involved in a delegation that met Simon Burns, Minister of State for Transport, on 26 November.\nDuring the meeting Mr Burns said that he had told the Department for Transport to review the decision to cut the line at Blackfriars and report back to him early in 2013.\nThe current plan would see the service – which links Sutton to Luton and St Albans through central and north London, calling at key stops such as the City, Farringdon and St Pancras International – severed at Blackfriars from 2018. But it transpired during the meeting that keeping the Loop Line intact would add only 28 seconds to average train times from Blackfriars, and Mr Burns told the meeting the engineering issues at Blackfriars were not insurmountable.\nRichard says “We have not yet won, But I think we can take heart from the fact that the Minister is now well aware of the issue and our strong views. He has agreed that the case must be reviewed. I hope the petition I was involved in presenting at the department for Transport has added to the pressure.”\nLOCAL COMMITTEE DEBATES OUR RESPONSES TO THAMESLINK CONSULTATION\nRichard and Heather called for action by the South Sutton, Cheam and Belmont Local Committee to support our Thameslink campaign, when initiating a debate at the committee on 11 October.\nWe drew attention to the submission we had put in on behalf of local residents (go to the category of posts called “Thameslink Campaign” to see our submission) to the recent Department of Transport consultation. Councillor Mary Burstow drew attention to her submission.\nWe know that many of our residents, with our proximity to Sutton station being a reason to live in our Ward, commute into London every day to work. Richard and Heather themselves did this for many years. Some commute to north London and the proposal to terminate Sutton’s Capital Connect trains at Blackfriars will add more than ten minutes in each direction to their daily commute, almost two hours extra down time a week. Taken with the effect of cutting us off from international services at St. Pancras, and Luton airport, and the fact that our ability to attract businesses to Sutton has been greatly enhanced by our good transport links, this proposal has to be resisted.\nThe most recent stage in what will be a battle with further, continuing stages was the combined Thameslink franchise consultation on which responses were required by mid-September.\nRichard commented, in the discussion “The reputation of civil servants at the Department of Transport, following the West Coast Main Line fiasco, is not high, and having worked there during the time that I was chair of the Channel tunnel Safety Authority, I am not altogether surprised. We will need to be vigilant in watching and contributing to the further steps in this process.\nI know that the way responses to consultation are analysed in the Department means that the volume of reaction is important. Councillor Honour and I put in our own response on behalf of our residents. Councillor Burstow did the same. ”\nRichard made some suggestions to prepare ourselves for the further stages.\n“First, I suggest that all those Councillors who put in submissions send them to the secretary so they can be included – along with his helpful note – with the papers for this meeting, so they are on the record to be used as necessary as an information quarry in further stages.\nSecond, we should consider, if it is appropriate at a later stage, passing a motion drawing attention to the difficulties this proposal causes for our residents, and send it to the Secretary of State, and seek a reply.\nThis is an important issue for our residents. On 23 August I presented a petition signed by over 5 000 residents, largely developed through Paul Burstow’s website, at the Department for Transport in Marsham Street, and the numbers wanting to sign shows how significant this is.”\nNEW ACTION BY YOUR COUNCILLORS TO SAVE CROSS-LONDON TRAIN SERVICES\nResponse to the Department for Transport Combined Thameslink Franchise Consultation\nFrom Councillor Richard Clifton and Councillor Heather Honour, Liberal Democrat Councillors for Sutton South, London Borough of Sutton\n1. We are the elected Liberal Democrat Councillors for Sutton South Ward, which is just south of Sutton railway station. Passengers leaving Sutton station to the south, by the side entrance (when it is open), pass into Sutton South Ward as they leave the station.\n2. Our Ward is almost entirely residential and a significant number of our residents commute daily into central London for work. Many of these commuters use trains on the Thameslink Loop Line to travel to stations north of Blackfriars, including Farringdon and St. Pancras. Residents of the Ward also tell us they consider they benefit greatly from having a direct service to St. Pancras International, for Continental Europe, and Luton airport.\n3. For that reason we are concerned at the proposal, first set out in the London and South East Route Utilisation Strategy (July 2011), that all Sutton / Wimbledon Thameslink Loop Line trains will terminate at London Blackfriars from 2018.\n4. Terminating Wimbledon Loop services at Blackfriars would result in our residents losing their cross-London service. This will penalise those of our residents who have made their residential, employment and educational location decisions on the basis of the existence of the cross-London Thameslink service. These residents, who chose to live in Sutton South on the basis of an existing pattern of transport connections, would lose a service that they have had for many years, and based their life around.\n5. Any decision should take account of the impact of changes on the travel patterns of existing passengers, and of consequent requirements to change established travel patterns. It is because of the impact on our residents that we object to any proposal that would result in terminating Wimbledon loop trains at Blackfriars.\n6. Not only would our residents lose a through service they have come to depend on, they would lose their connection with Eurostar and domestic long distance trains at St. Pancras International and Kings Cross. Instead they would have to change trains at Blackfriars, carrying possibly heavy luggage onto already crowded trains. This movement could be particularly difficult from the western bay platform when travelling north and to either bay platform when travelling south because of the platform lengths and the position of lifts and stairs at each end of the platforms. The recent Passenger Focus passenger survey found that having to change trains was a strong disincentive to train travel.\n7. Sutton is identified in the London Plan as one of only four Metropolitan town centres in south London , with a large and growing population and employment base. It is a major business centre with many commuters and business travellers. It is therefore essential that Sutton, as a strategic south London destination, retains its connections to central and north London and beyond, and maintains its direct link to St. Pancras and the City.\n8. We also believe that the attractiveness of Sutton to employers considering re-location away from expensive offices in central London would be affected. Sutton is a location from which one can travel to Brussels with just two train journeys, one taking 45 minutes and one two hours, and the journey to Paris is only fifteen minutes longer. We have been successful in attracting businesses to Sutton and this change would have a negative impact, particularly given the expected mushrooming of international train travel from St. Pancras over the next few years. These negative effects would impact on the residents of our Ward who want to work locally in Sutton.\n9. We thus strongly object to any proposal that would result in terminating Wimbledon loop trains at Blackfriars from 2018.\n10. We are aware that Sutton Council is submitting comments, and support those comments. However, we are making this submission to draw particular attention to the impact on our residents in Sutton South Ward.\nRICHARD CLIFTON\nHEATHER HONOUR\nLiberal Democrat Councillors for Sutton South, London Borough of Sutton\nTHREAT TO SUTTON’S COMMUTER SERVICES: RICHARD AND HEATHER SUPPORT ACTION\nMANY RESIDENTS OF SUTTON SOUTH WARD COMMUTE INTO CENTRAL LONDON EVERY DAY TO WORK.\nSERVICES WILL BE CUT AND JOURNEYS ON OTHER ROUTES MORE CROWDED UNLESS WE CAN STOP THE PROPOSALS TO AXE SERVICES TO FARRINGDON, St PANCRAS AND BEYOND.\nAfter Richard made a stirring speech to Sutton Council about transport services on 16 July, Richard and Heather joined rail campaigners in Sutton for a day of action on 18 July in a bid to save our vital link to The City, St. Pancras, North London and stations to Luton.\nUnder current plans Thameslink Loop Line trains which link Sutton to St. Albans and Luton through central and north London will terminate at Blackfriars station from 2018.\nBut Richard, Heather and other campaigners – including our two LibDem MPs and the Leader of the Council Ruth Dombey – boarded trains on the morning of 18 July to travel to Blackfriars as part of our day of action.\nRichard – who was interviewed on BBC Radio London that morning as part of the campaign – summarised our case in a speech he made to Sutton Council on 16 July. He said:\n“We all know the importance to Sutton of maintaining a through rail service to north London.\nI want to stress the importance of links to St Pancras International as St Pancras develops further as an international rail hub.\nOver the next few years there will be a positive mushrooming of international rail travel from London. If the current plans of Deutschbahn and Eurostar come to fruition, by 2014 it will be possible, on arriving at St Pancras, to have a choice of services to travel from London to Amsterdam.\nIn addition to the current services to Brussels and Paris there will also be services from London to North Germany. This is a big market in terms of business travel. At present, each day, about 30 planes fly from London’s airports to destinations in north Germany, carrying about the same number of people as could be carried by just a few trains, using the Velaro D trains that are being built to provide rolling stock for these new services from London, by the train manufacturer Siemens at its Dusseldorf factory, which in fact I visited recently.\nAside from the potential importance of these international links to the residents of Sutton, there are international companies that have significant centres of their enterprises in Sutton – Sutton, a thriving London suburb, offering office space much cheaper than that found in the centre of London, less than half an hour by train from the centre, with a pleasant ambience and environment, and a location from which – importantly – you can reach the centre of Brussels in just two train journeys, one taking about 40 minutes and one about 2 hours. And the centre of Paris in just 15 minutes more. And soon – Amsterdam, north Germany.\nNow, these are transport links that it is vital for Sutton to maintain, for the sake of our residents but also to maintain our attractiveness as a centre for business development. When I look at the data on economic activity that comes regularly to the new Housing, Economy and Business committee, some clear conclusions stand out. It is clear that Sutton is doing relatively well in terms of surviving the recession and maintaining one of the highest rates of economic activity on the part of its residents of any part of London. But we need to continue to attract new businesses.\nThe Tramlink extension is perhaps equally important, particularly in relation to the north Sutton site, which is an attractive site, and on which the Housing, Economy and Business committee now has a task group working on the planning brief. Our current plans include scope for a Tramlink stop at the site, something that will greatly enhance its appeal, and we see this development as an important part of our future growth strategy.\nSo we must keep pressure on TfL to continue work on the feasibility of the Sutton Tramlink proposal, and make clear to the Department for Transport that changes that remove our linoks to north London and in particular to St Pancras, are not acceptable.\nThe Thameslink service is absolutely vital. Losing it would sever our only direct link to North London and would mean Sutton residents would need to take at least two trains to get to St Pancras. It is quite scandalous that, at a time when we should be improving public transport, there is a serious proposal to cut the link between North and South London.”\nWe need to act now as the Department for Transport is currently consulting on the new seven-year Thameslink franchise which will run from September next year and incorporate the Southern franchise from 2015.\nIronically, the cross-London Loop Line service which runs through Sutton, Carshalton and Hackbridge stations, was recently reopened at nights and weekends after being split for three and a half years by engineering work. It is all very well reopening it now, but Sutton’s residents need the line to stay open for good.\nThe new franchise will set service patterns for 2018 and beyond, so it is vital that we act now and do not become a Cinderella area for rail transport.\nTo view the DfT consultation document visit www.dft.gov.uk/consultations\nTo give your input into Sutton’s response, email alex.forrest@sutton.gov.uk\nRichard and Heather will be submitting their own response.\nMore detail about the attitude the Council is taking, opposing this threat, is in a further post on this site “Train Links To North London Must Remain” (see archive July 2011).\nNEW PLAN TO OPEN UP THE SIDE ENTRANCE TO SUTTON STATION\nAs local Councillors, we have been enthusiastically promoting and supporting a campaign to ease the congestion at peak times at Sutton station and create an easier route into and out of the station for Sutton South residents by opening up the side entrance. We will continue to promote this campaign.\nOur latest proposal is that we will be preparing a bid under TfL’s “Major Schemes Funding”, for this scheme. The bids are required to be submitted to TfL in September, so we have started work on it and Council Leader Ruth Dombey wrote to Boris Johnson on 29 May to seek his support. We will consult with stakeholders as appropriate. The bid will be for a wider scheme to improve the area around the station, a “Major Scheme” bid. Opening up and staffing the station side entrance is a matter for Southern Rail so the Council will need to enter into an agreement with them to open it up. They agreed to this ‘in principle’ during the Outer London Fund bid preparation, when the Council submitted a well-researched bid for funding under the Mayor’s Outer London Fund to facilitate the opening of the side entrance at the station.\nOpening the side entrance would be of benefit to the many commuters and other travellers who live in South Sutton Ward, who could enter and leave the station by this entrance, leading directly into The Quadrant. A page on this site (“Ward Map”) leads you to a map of the Ward, which shows the importance of opening this entrance. As rail travellers pass through the side entrance they would cross the boundary into Sutton South Ward.\nAs Sutton South Ward Councillors we strongly support this bid, as the outcome would be of benefit to our residents.\nThe Council wants to improve the “Gateway” into Sutton and the experience of those arriving in Sutton. Hence it wishes to improve Sutton station. The station is an important focal point for the town centre and the first impression that many visitors have of Sutton. It has been identified byTransport for London as a station that suffers from congestion problems due to its limited capacity in terms of the front entrance hall and ticket barriers. The Council continues to hope, in partnership with Southern Rail, to open the side entrance to the station for passenger use. In the longer term a more comprehensive re-development of the station is hoped for to expand and modernise passenger facilities and and enhance this important gateway and transport interchange.\nThe side entrance at Sutton station would cater for the considerable demand for direct access to the station from the Quadrant House office block, which houses Reed Business Information (which has approximately 2 000 employess, many of whom travel to work by train) and a number of other companies. This office block and those who work there are an important contributor to the economic vitality of Sutton. Reed Business Information fully supported the bid. The new side entrance would also serve the station car park, motor cycle and cycle parking areas, which generate considerable demand for access from that side of the station. It would also serve all the residents of Sutton South Ward who approach the station via Wellesley Road from the Langley Park Road direction.\nOpening up the side entrance, which physically is already there, requires the installation of automatic ticket barriers with Oyster readers, a new ticket machine, associated lighting, signing, communication improvements and CCTV improvements. Staffing costs would be met by Southern Rail. It is accepted that the side entrance would probably not be open all day, but using the entrance could ease the congestion at the station if open during peak hours in the morning and evening.\nDespite this strong case, the Mayor refused to support the earlier Outer London Fund bid, although accepting other aspects of the Council’s bid for funding under that scheme. We are not giving up and are taking forward this further “Major Schemes Funding” option. Let us hope for eventual success, as this development will be of value to the residents of Sutton South Ward.\nTRAIN LINKS TO NORTH LONDON MUST REMAIN\nSutton Council agreed a motion on Monday 18 July deploring a proposal floated by the train operating companies that trains from Sutton on the Capital Connect line to north London (passing through Farringdon, St. Pancras International and St. Albans on the way to Luton airport) would all terminate at Blackfriars.\nCouncillor Clifton was to be one of the proposers of the motion but due to the length of debate on earlier motions the motion was voted on without debate. Here is the text of the speech he was to have made:\n“I am confident that we will all want to support this motion and to emphasise the importance to Sutton of maintaining a through rail service to north London. I’d like to mention a significant detail that ought to be recognised in our examination of this proposal here tonight.\nThis concerns the importance of links to St Pancras International as St Pancras develops further as an international rail hub.\nOver the next few years there will be a mushrooming of international rail travel from London. If the current plans of Deutschbahn and Eurostar come to fruition – as they will – by 2014 it will be possible, on arriving at St Pancras, to have a choice of services, competing against each other, to travel from London to Amsterdam.\nIn addition to the current services to Brussels and Paris there will also be services from London to North Germany. This is a big market in terms of business travel. At present, each day, about 30 plane services fly between London’s airports and destinations in north Germany, carrying about the same number of people as could be carried by four or five train services using the Velaro D trains that are even now being built to provide rolling stock for these services, by the train manufacturer Siemens at its Dusseldorf factory, which in fact I visited last year.\nAside from the potential importance of these international links to the residents of Sutton, there are international companies that have significant centres of their enterprises in Sutton – Sutton, a thriving London suburb, offering office space much cheaper than that found in the centre of London, less than half an hour by train from the centre, with a pleasant ambience and environment, and a location from which – importantly – you can reach the centre of Brussels in just two train journeys, one taking about 40 minutes and one about 2 hours.\nAnd the centre of Paris in just 15 minutes more. And soon – Amsterdam, north Germany.\nThese transport links are links that it is vital for Sutton to maintain, for the sake of our residents but also to maintain our attractiveness as a centre for business development.\nWe must keep pressure on the Department for Transport to make clear that the changes to the Capital Connect franchise being sought by the domestic train companies, that remove our links to north London and in particular to St Pancras, are just not acceptable.”",

The full text can be found at the end of this post.\nTo put in your submission email it to teamp2@pins.gsi.gov.uk for the attention of Peter Lyne, Case Officer, quoting Planning Inspectorate reference APP/P5870/A/12/2184339/NWF.\nWe object to the proposal on the grounds that it is overdevelopment of the site, with 50 dwellings crammed in. It is the type of low-quality accommodation that we continue to oppose in our Ward, where there are instances of the Planning Inspectorate overturning local decisions and allowing substantial family houses to be demolished to make way for blocks of small flats without gardens. There are current examples in Eaton Road and Albion Road, sites where building work is currently underway, the proposals rejected by Sutton Council but allowed by the Planning Inspectorate. Half the children in our Ward live in accommodation without access to a garden. There is a shortage of affordable family homes.\nIn addition, the provision for car parking (33 car parking spaces for 50 dwellings) is inadequate and will lead to great pressure on parking, with additional demand for parking in the area.\nOur reasons are, unsurprisingly, almost identical with the reasons given by the Council for rejecting the application.\nOur submission objecting to the proposal was included in the papers that went to the Council’s Development Control Committee on 5 September, and Richard attended the Committee meeting, though he was not called to be a member of the panel of Councillors reaching a decision that evening.\nHERE IS THE FULL TEXT OF OUR SUBMISSION\nFor the attention of Peter Lyne, Case Officer\nPostal Address:\nPeter Lyne\nThe Planning Inspectorate\n3/10 Wing\nTemple Quay House\n2 The Square\nBristol.\nBS1 6PN\nAppeal relating to 54 – 58 Overton Road, Sutton, Surrey, SM2 6RB\nLondon Borough of Sutton Reference B2012/66079/FUL\nPlanning Inspectorate reference APP/P5870/A/12/2184339/NWF\nSUBMISSION\nWe understand this appeal is being determined by written procedure.\nWe would like to comment on this appeal, and ask that our comments are considered by the Inspector.\nWe are elected Councillors for Sutton South Ward in the London Borough of Sutton.\nAlthough the development is not in Sutton South Ward, it is very close to the Ward. The Ward boundary runs down Overton Road in front of the property. Our residents are among those affected by the proposal and objecting to it.\nWe object to the proposal on the grounds, first, that it is overdevelopment of the site, with 50 dwellings crammed in. It is the type of low-quality accommodation that we continue to oppose in our own Ward, where there are many instances of substantial family houses being demolished to make way for blocks of small flats without gardens. Half the children at the one primary school in our Ward live in accommodation without access to a garden. There are a lot of small flats but a shortage of affordable family homes. Couples who live in the flats in the Ward often find that when they have children, and the flat is too small, they cannot find a home they can afford in the area so have to move away.\nSecond, the provision for car parking (33 car parking spaces for 50 dwellings) is inadequate and will lead to great pressure on parking, with additional demand for parking in an area that is already fully parked up much of the time.\nOur reasons are almost identical with the reasons given by the Council for rejecting the application.\nWe note that there is to be a site visit.

  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_2019_02_27_where-we-are-on-parking/content_395.html": "THIS ARTICLE WAS PUBLISHED IN FEBRUARY 2019. THERE ARE LATER DEVELOPMENTS COVERED IN LATER ARTICLES, ABOVE. THIS ARTICLE IS KEPT ON THE SITE TO SHOW HOW THE PROPOSALS EVOLVED.\nWe would like to again thank residents who have contributed to the two stages of consultation by the Council on parking.\nSince some misinformation has been put round in the Ward, we want to summarise where matters now stand – though all the information on the process is on the Council’s website, click on parking and follow the links to the parking strategy.\nNo decisions have been taken. We await the analysis by the traffic engineers of the results of the second consultation. As Councillors, we only want to do what residents want. We will be guided by the results of consultation and are determined not to impose our own views on this process.\nWhat we know from the first consultation is this. Much of Sutton South Ward experiences a high demand for parking as we are close to the town centre and the railway station. Parking is rationed by having a controlled parking zone (CPZ) but this leads to bumper to bumper parking six days a week in the roads just outside the zone, such as Mayfield Road. The results of the first round of consultation were consistent with previous studies by Councillors, the Council and the residents’ association, in that:\n- there is a strong majority favouring parking controls in Mayfield Road\n- there are more mixed views in Chalgrove Road and The Ridgway but, overall, support for controls\n- there are more mixed views in Upland Road and roads beyond, though less support for parking controls the further you are from the CPZ.\nThe proposals of officers was to introduce controls in Mayfield, The Ridgway and Chalgrove. It will be interesting to see whether the results of the second consultation mean that other roads, in particular Upland Road, want to join the scheme. The objective of having successive consultations was to let residents have a second opportunity to give a view when they could see what was proposed for neighbouring roads, recognising that any parking scheme will lead to some displacement.\nPrevious surveys have suggested that there is no appetite for a full CPZ with machines. The solution adopted with success elsewhere in Sutton, including in Hillcroome Road, is to have a mix of yellow lines operative for an hour a day to deter commuters, with some free to park bays. These bays are needed to cater for residents who will need to park a vehicle on the road and they also reduce the amount of displacement into neighbouring roads, which is a legitimate consideration.\nAn alternative that has been suggested is to have a “residents’ only” parking scheme with residents obtaining a permit to park during controlled hours. Disadvantages are that this scheme would involve extensive signage along the roads involved, bureaucracy, and a cost as the administrative costs of dealing with permit applications would have to be covered by charges for permits. It would also lead to more displacement. We welcome views on that alternative.\nParking has been an issue of concern locally for the 30 years Richard has lived in The Ridgway. We want to tackle this issue though recognising that it is problematic. We are consulting and will do what the majority of residents want, not impose our own solutions.",
  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_category_news_page_28/content_783.html": "125 th. ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATIONS\nThe weekend of the 13th and 14th July marked the 125th. anniversary of Christchurch in Christchurch Park.\nRichard brought the New London Concert Band, for whom he plays trumpet, to Christchurch on Sunday afternoon to perform a concert, as part of the celebrations. A large audience, on a hot day, listened to a concert that included a selection of James Bond themes, some Bach, a lot of Leroy Anderson (Blue Tango, Belle of the Ball), themes from Walt Disney films, and a lot more.\nCARING FOR SUTTON’S 20 000 STREET TREES\nSutton is famous for its street trees, over 20 000 in the Borough and over a thousand in our Ward. It is what gives Sutton its green, pleasant, suburban feel that people so like. Low crime, good schools and a pleasant suburban feel. We like Sutton.\nA lot of correspondence with residents this summer about the basal growth of trees, which seems to have been particularly vigorous. The programme is well underway to cut it back and we are monitoring progress. We got them to give priority to Cavendish Road and some trees on street corners, like the one below, where the basal growth was affecting sight lines of car drivers at junctions.\nAnd after.\nA COMPLETE WARD TOUR\nHeather and Richard marked the first day of July by spending the morning undertaking a complete tour of the Ward, going down every road. They noted every pothold in the Ward and were able to compile a full list of problems – including areas where there was a bit of rubbish that needed clearing up, a dumped washing machine and sink, some graffiti (not a lot, this is much less of a problem than it was a few years ago), and candidates for further grit bins (but there are a lot in the Ward already) and rubbish bins. Basal growth of trees is vigorous this year but the programmeto cut it back is underway. We have noted some specific problems and got them dealt with.\nLet us know of any locations you are concerned about that ought to be on their list.\nHOW IS SUTTON SURVIVING THE RECESSION?\nThe latest data continue to show that Sutton is surviving the recession well.\nThey show that average house prices in Sutton (as measured by the average price of houses in Sutton sold in any particular month) were up almost 1% in February of this year compared to the previous month, and stood at 4.2% above the figure for a year previously. The cost of the average house sold in February, the latest month for which reliable data are available, was £255 000. This bullishness in the housing market is generally taken as an indicator of confidence in the local economy.\nPositive indicators include:\nThe economic activity rate of working age adults in Sutton, at 81%, continues to be well above the average for London, which is 76%. Sutton residents continue to find work, and the percentage has increased (by 0.5%) in the last year. Many residents commute to central London for work, and it is unsurprising that the average pay of employees working in Sutton (£519 a week) is less than that in central London.\nThis finding, that Sutton residents continue to find work, is supported by the decline in numbers claiming Job Seekers Allowance, down by 7% in March compared to the figure for a year previously.\nThat said, the number of people who have been collecting JSA for over a year has risen in the last year, suggesting that those who have become distanced from the labour market are finding it more difficult to get work. Richard says this mirrors what he finds, as a local Councillor, in his casework, with people made redundant in their 50’s often finding it hard to get back into work.\nThis suggests that the Council’s “Opportunity Sutton” programme is an important priority. Jobs are gold dust and the prosperity of the Borough depends on people finding and staying in work.\nNew business start ups were at a record level in Sutton in 2012, with 863 new companies formed.\nThe number of local companies going into administration was down in the most recent quarter (January to March) and down on figures for a year previously.\nThe data that comes to the Housing, Economy and Business Committee usually shows a mixed picture, but the latest data are mostly encouraging. One negative that concerns us is that enquiries to Sutton’s Citizens’ Advice Bureau were up by about 5% in the last quarter, with debt advice enquiries increasing by 8.8%. Richard has said his piece, at Sutton Council meetings, about the problem of “payday” loans and we cannot see why it is impossible to have a maximum figure for the interest charged on these loans (it can be over 1000% APR) imposed in law. Richard’s comments are included in a separate post on this site on this subject.\nThis information is analysed by Richard in his role as vice-chair of the Council’s Housing, Economy and Business Committee, which has oversight of economic development matters and the “Opportunity Sutton” programme. This is currently generating projects involving over £90 million worth of investment in Sutton, including the “Sutton Gateway” project to develop and improve the area from Sutton Court to the station. We hope this will include improving and opening up the side entrance to Sutton station, better shops and restaurants, new jobs from office development, more housing as Sutherland House is developed, the relocation of the recycling bins at The Quadrant and a general tidying up of the area.\nRAISING THE FLAG\nAVOIDING THE MISERY OF HOMELESSNESS – RICHARD COMMENDS THE COUNCIL’S APPROACH\nIt fell to Richard, as vice-chair of Sutton’s Housing, Economy and Business Committee, to make the case, when the Committee met on 18 June, for the scrutiny report prepared by the Committee on the Council’s procedures to deal with those about to become homeless.\nRichard told the Committee that homelessness – being put in bed and breakfast accommodation often far from Sutton – is a terrible experience, especially for families. It can lead to people losing their jobs if they are too far away to travel back every day. It can lead to mental breakdown, marriage breakdown, and the disruption of the education of children. Our first priority is to avoid this, and it is not too much to ask landlords to wait a week or two in some cases before a property is vacated as a last effort is made to find somewhere else to live.\nThe report commended the approach that the Council has traditionally used, and was implicitly critical of modifications to the procedure introduced in Feruary to respond to some criticisms of the approach that, the scrutiny report concluded, were not well founded.\nThis was the first scrutiny study undertaken by one of the Council’s subject committees established when governance arrangements were revised last year. The Committee studied a number of documents when it met on 19 March, and listened to a variety of views, from Council officers, from officers from a neighbouring authority (Croydon) and a landlord who voiced criticisms of the Council’s approach. It was evident from these documents that Sutton’s approach is identical to that of most, indeed almost all, London Boroughs.\nThe report describes the procedures followed by the Council. To evict a tenant from a property a landlord has to go through a legal procedure with a number of steps commencing with a notice to quit and ending with the execution of a bailiff’s warrant.\nRichard, whose daughter works for the largest charity supporting the homeless in the West Midlands, commented:\n“This is a procedure involving a private landlord and a private tenant, so it is worthwhile just reminding ourselves why the Council gets involved atall. This is because at the end of the procedure, if someone has no other accommodation and is homeless and in priority need, the obligation falls on the Council to find them accommodation. This usually means putting them in bed and breakfast accommodation, something that can be soul destroying for the family or individual concerned, and an expensive procedure involving costs that ultimately fall on our own Council tax payers.\nSo, the Council has a unit doing all in its power to assist those threatened with homelessness to find new accommodation. The report shows that in many cases they are successful, and that alternative accommodation is often found quite late in the eviction process. If they are not successful, at the end of the process the tenant will be put into bed and breakfast accommodation, but this is rightly regarded as a last resort to be undertaken when all else has failed. The process followed is described in Appendix A of the paper, and the first recommendation in the paper is to support the approach described, on the basis that this offers the best chance of minimising the numbers made homeless, thus minimising both the cost and human misery that homelessness involves, but correctly discharging the Council’s legal duties to those threatened with homelessness.\nThe criticisms of the approach, first voiced by Councillor Shields at a Council meeting, picked up by the local paper in the memorable but misleading headline “Council says wait till the bailiffs arrive”, and repeated by at least one landlord, appear to be that by waiting to the end of the process the Council runs the risk of upsetting landlords and thus discouraging landlords from working with the Council. It was also suggested that the tenants are disadvantaged by having a Court judgement against them. But the evidence in the paper (paragraphs 2.18 to 2.30) is that the Council maintains good relations with landlords, and that the Court judgement relates to possession of a property and does not affect the standing of the individual or family made homeless.\nOfficers told us, however, that for a period from February 2013 a modified approach was trialled, described in Appendix B, involving moving earlier to accept someone was homeless if it appeared that there was no realistic prospect of finding alternative accommodation. It is not often that, in assessing policy options, one can compare the outcome from two periods where different policies were tried. But the evidence in the paper (see paragraphs 2.16 and 3.8) is that the modified approach led to an increase in homelessness, as accommodation is often found for those threatened with homelessness quite late in the process.\nSo the recommendations support our continuing to follow the procedures described in Appendix A, but also call on officers to continue to work closely with landlords, keep the trends and statistics under review, and report back to us in due course.\nHomelessness – being put in bed and breakfast accommodation often far from Sutton – is a terrible experience, especially for families. I know from my casework that it can lead to people losing their jobs if they are too far away to travel back every day, to mental breakdown, to marriage breakdown, and to the disruption of the education of children. Our first priority is to avoid this, and it is not too much to ask landlords to wait a further week or two in some cases before a property is vacated as a last effort is made to find somewhere else to live.”\nEARLY SUCCESS FOR CAMPAIGN TO BRING TRAMS TO SUTTON\nSutton Council’s campaign to bring trams to the Borough is celebrating an early success.\nPlans to extend the existing Tramlink network to Sutton have been included in the Mayor’s new vision for London document, “2020 Vision – The Greatest City on Earth”, published last week. It outlines some of the challenges facing the capital, including housing, employment and transport.\nSutton Council, business and residents support the tram extension, which will improve transport links in and out of, and across, Sutton. The project will also create and sustain new jobs, drive economic growth, ease traffic congestion and reduce CO2 emissions.\nWe understand the original draft of the Mayor’s vision document made no mention of bringing the tram to Sutton, but our Tramlink campaign, still in its infancy, has already yielded a result. The Mayor of London is asking us to demonstrate how this investment will be justified by the improvements it can bring in terms of jobs, growth, and housing.\nSutton is already one step ahead. We have commissioned research which demonstrates that extending Tramlink to Sutton will create 10,000 jobs, bring forward sites for residential development, and support and boost the economy.\nWe know that extending Tramlink will ensure Sutton continues to prosper into the future. The Borough of Sutton has had an ambition to bring Tramlink to Sutton since 2003 when it was included in the Unitary Development Plan. The Borough has successfully worked with Transport for London to examine the feasibility of bringing trams to central Sutton, connecting it to St Helier Hospital, Morden Tube Station and Wimbledon. At some point a spur through our Ward, Sutton South, would connect to the Marsden hospital. This feasibility work is ongoing, and Sutton’s Tramlink campaign seeks to ensure the Mayor will continue to fund this work in Transport for London’s future budgets.\nCANNABIS, DOGS, SPEEDING, DRINKING, ATTEMPTED BURGLARIES – BUT SUTTON SOUTH REMAINS A LOW CRIME AREA\nHeather and Richard attended the Sutton South Ward police panel on 12 June. There was discussion of current crime trends, including recent burglaries and attempted burglaries in Mayfield Road.\nWhile the police were unable to give a reason for these incidents they commented that sometimes there is a “clustering” of crime in an area for a short period for no obvious reason, but it would be unusual for it to persist as a problem. They have moved quickly to re-assure residents and have knocked on doors in Mayfield Road, and left a feedback form where there was no-one in. If you have any observations you want to make to the local police you can contact them on ztsnt-suttonsouth@met.police.uk\nAlso, nine local residents attended their recent street briefing.\nWhile no-one can ever be complacent and we must all maintain our vigilance, it remains the case that this Ward is a low crime area, indeed one of the safest areas in south London. Burglary, along with theft from motor vehicles, remains a police priority for the area, but the most common form of burglary in our area is theft from garages, and residential (house) burglaries are mercifully rare.\nThe meeting also discussed future action on speeding, a dog seizure in Cumnor Road, a cannabis factory in Westmoreland Drive and the success of the extension of the “No Drinking Zone” to our Ward.\nWe also discussed the introduction of the “London Policing Model” on 24 June. While the implications are not all positive, these changes are not going to damage the excellent service we generally get from our local police.\nNext street briefing: 12 July outside Lavender Court in Cavendish Road.\nSUBSTANTIAL PRICE INCENTIVES PROPOSED TO HELP PEOPLE MOVE TO GIBSON ROAD CAR PARK IF BRIGHTON ROAD CAR PARK CLOSES\nSpeaking at the Environment and Neighbourhoods Committee on 13 June Richard welcomed progress on agreeing a structure of incentives to persuade Brighton Road car park users to move to Gibson Road if the car park closes. Currently, Subsea7 are applying for planning permission to build a new international headquarters (see above) on the site.\nRichard pointed out that this development will safeguard several hundred jobs currently in Sutton that were likely to move elsewhere, and bring a further three to four hundred jobs into Sutton South Ward. These new jobs are good news for Sutton.\nThis development will create jobs, not just for engineers but a range of less skilled jobs (clerks, receptionists, cleaners, messengers, drivers etc.). This site is surrounded by areas of social housing where we meet, in our casework, people who are out of work and whose lives would be transformed by finding work. Every day we open the newspaper and see news of more redundancies nationwide – but Richard and Heather can speak of securing an extra 300 plus jobs in our Ward. The development will also give an uplift to the area, the Gateway to Sutton from the south, with office workers and the company’s clients spending money in local shops, restaurants and hotels, creating further jobs.\nBut the second message is that to deal with local concerns about parking in local streets if the car park closes, we need to persuade the users of the Brighton Road car park to use the town centre car parks, which have the capacity. The average weekday demand at peak occupancy of the car park is about 380 vehicles and 320 have season tickets. So the season ticket holders are key.\nThe first and most important element in the strategy is a financial discount to persuade people to move. The discount proposed by the Committee, as a recommendation to the Strategy and Resources Committee, says to the season ticket holders “move to Gibson Road and you will pay, for the first year, what you paid last year less 10% – unless, you already have a discount, in which case it continues. This is to compensate you for the inconvenience of moving and to provide an incentive to move to Gibson Road”.\nWe hope this will persuade people to move, to a car park which is no more than seven minutes walk away.\nThe further element of the strategy is improvements in respect of signage to the car parks (including electronic signs indicating what number spaces are available) and improvements in access, in particular enabling those leaving Gibson Road to avoid the town centre one way system.\nWe hope this proposed substantial discount will achieve the right result, so that we will be able to secure the major advantage of the new jobs while coping with the reduction in parking space. The structure of discounts will, however, be further considered by the Strategy and Resources Committee.",

Approaches to the bridge are at 90 degree bends and the bridge parapets are a combination of solid brick with rails on top which makes the sight lines very poor.\nThere have been 3 personal injuries at the junction between April 2008 and April 2011, and residents who use the park have reported numerous “bumps” as cars failed to negotiate the difficult twists and turns safely.\nHeather Honour, Lib Dem Councillor for Sutton South, raised this in April at the Sutton South, Cheam and Belmont Local Committee, Discussions followed with other councillors in Sutton South and the neighbouring ward, Carshalton Central, residents and with the council’s traffic engineers.\nOn July 5th Heather presented a proposal to the Local Committee drawn up by traffic engineers. Building out the footways on both sides of the junction would slow and guide vehicles on a more visible line and provide a longer footway for pedestrians. The warning signs will be upgraded and re positioned and be more prominent. The cost of implementing the complete scheme is £16,000. Other improvements, amounting to £500 will be made at the Carshalton end of the bridge.\nFunding will be allocated from the Local Implementation Plan. The work should begin in November 2012.\nCouncillor Heather Honour said,\n“ Someone said to me that the road is so dangerous we should leave it as it is. I don’t think that is good enough for our residents who risk their lives every day as they walk or drive over Kings Lane Bridge. Our traffic engineers have worked hard to find the best solution because no one wants the road closed to traffic or made one way.\nIt is great that funding can be found quickly and let’s hope that the work can be completed before we have snow and ice on the bridge”.",

Under the new proposals that will soar to 14-15 minutes to St George’s in Tooting, 16-17 minutes to Kingston and up to 20 minutes to Croydon Hospital.\nLiberal Democrat Councillor Mary Burstow, Chair of the Scrutiny Committee, said: “These are truly alarming figures. Report after report has shown that the quicker people get treatment the better the outcome. Doubling journey times can only put Sutton residents at greater risk.”\nThe well-attended meeting also heard that turnaround time – how long it takes from an ambulance arriving at a hospital to being ready to go on another call – is 15 minutes or less on average at St. Helier Hospital, again half the time of neighbouring hospitals.\nCouncillor Burstow added: “In light of these figures, it is absolutely astonishing that Better Services Better Value (BSBV) [the NHS body that recommended closure of St. Helier’s Accident and Emergency Department] didn’t bother to ask seek wider views and opinions.”\nThe BSBV panel last month recommended that St Helier Hospital’s A&E, maternity and children’s wards should be closed – leaving St George’s, Kingston and Croydon to deal with the patients.\nSt Helier would instead become a centre for planned operations.\nAge UK Sutton, which represents around 27,000 people – and Sutton Carers – which has 4,500 registered members looking after thousands of people – also told the meeting that they had also not been consulted before BSBV made its recommendations.\nIn robust exchanges between councillors and Rachel Tyndall, BSBV Senior Responsible Officer, and Mike Bailey, Acute Medical Director for BSBV, Sutton Council Leader Ruth Dombey referred to previous threats to St Helier saying: “We have been through years of uncertainty, so we are more than a little cynical.”\nCouncillor Dombey added: “Under the proposals St Helier would become the site for elective surgery for patients from Ham to New Addington.\n“Is there any guarantee they would come? What about the transport issues? Where would they park when they got here?”\nDuring the meeting it was revealed that BSBV’s recommendation supposes that between 2013 when the decision is due to be made and 2017 when it should be implemented, up to 50% of A&E patients would be persuaded to seek treatment in the community instead of going to hospital.\nClick here to sign our petition organised by local LibDems, on the website of Paul Burstow.

  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_category_planning_page_6/content_92.html": "As local Councillors, we have been enthusiastically promoting and supporting a campaign to ease the congestion at peak times at Sutton station and create an easier route into and out of the station for Sutton South residents by opening up the side entrance. We will continue to promote this campaign.\nOur latest proposal is that we will be preparing a bid under TfL’s “Major Schemes Funding”, for this scheme. The bids are required to be submitted to TfL in September, so we have started work on it and Council Leader Ruth Dombey wrote to Boris Johnson on 29 May to seek his support. We will consult with stakeholders as appropriate. The bid will be for a wider scheme to improve the area around the station, a “Major Scheme” bid. Opening up and staffing the station side entrance is a matter for Southern Rail so the Council will need to enter into an agreement with them to open it up. They agreed to this ‘in principle’ during the Outer London Fund bid preparation, when the Council submitted a well-researched bid for funding under the Mayor’s Outer London Fund to facilitate the opening of the side entrance at the station.\nOpening the side entrance would be of benefit to the many commuters and other travellers who live in South Sutton Ward, who could enter and leave the station by this entrance, leading directly into The Quadrant. A page on this site (“Ward Map”) leads you to a map of the Ward, which shows the importance of opening this entrance. As rail travellers pass through the side entrance they would cross the boundary into Sutton South Ward.\nAs Sutton South Ward Councillors we strongly support this bid, as the outcome would be of benefit to our residents.\nThe Council wants to improve the “Gateway” into Sutton and the experience of those arriving in Sutton. Hence it wishes to improve Sutton station. The station is an important focal point for the town centre and the first impression that many visitors have of Sutton. It has been identified byTransport for London as a station that suffers from congestion problems due to its limited capacity in terms of the front entrance hall and ticket barriers. The Council continues to hope, in partnership with Southern Rail, to open the side entrance to the station for passenger use. In the longer term a more comprehensive re-development of the station is hoped for to expand and modernise passenger facilities and and enhance this important gateway and transport interchange.\nThe side entrance at Sutton station would cater for the considerable demand for direct access to the station from the Quadrant House office block, which houses Reed Business Information (which has approximately 2 000 employess, many of whom travel to work by train) and a number of other companies. This office block and those who work there are an important contributor to the economic vitality of Sutton. Reed Business Information fully supported the bid. The new side entrance would also serve the station car park, motor cycle and cycle parking areas, which generate considerable demand for access from that side of the station. It would also serve all the residents of Sutton South Ward who approach the station via Wellesley Road from the Langley Park Road direction.\nOpening up the side entrance, which physically is already there, requires the installation of automatic ticket barriers with Oyster readers, a new ticket machine, associated lighting, signing, communication improvements and CCTV improvements. Staffing costs would be met by Southern Rail. It is accepted that the side entrance would probably not be open all day, but using the entrance could ease the congestion at the station if open during peak hours in the morning and evening.\nDespite this strong case, the Mayor refused to support the earlier Outer London Fund bid, although accepting other aspects of the Council’s bid for funding under that scheme. We are not giving up and are taking forward this further “Major Schemes Funding” option. Let us hope for eventual success, as this development will be of value to the residents of Sutton South Ward.",

The renovation will convert the building to 128 luxury flats with car parking spaces, one per flat.\nThey expect the work to be finished by March 2016. They will be appointing local estate agents to act for them to offer the flats for rent. We are a little surprised that they are to be offered for rent rather than sale, but given the location close to the station there will be no shortage of demand. We doubt if they will be actively marketing the flats until the work is sufficiently progressed for them to have a show flat for people to look at, but they say the work will be to a high standard.\nWe have been critical of the developers as they used a route to bypass normal planning permission requirements, but at last work is under way and we have a date by which the building will be occupied. The year 2016 will be a good one for the area with the occupation of the Subsea7 building and Sutherland House, bringing people into the area who will spend money in local shops and restaurants, which will give the whole area an uplift.\nThe argument over the future of Sutherland House was the subject of a letter from Richard published by The Guardian (the national paper, not the Sutton Guardian) on 5 February. Here is the text:\n“Sir\nCongratulations to The Guardian for exposing the loss of affordable housing that has resulted from the Government’s successive changes to planning law.\nThe latest changes are in a series that have progressively created major loopholes to excuse developers from providing affordable housing. Just south of Sutton station, in south London, there is an office building, empty for some years, which the developers propose to convert to 128 luxury flats. The day before Sutton Council’s Planning Committee was to approve the scheme, which included a significant number of affordable homes, the developers withdrew the scheme. They had spotted the advantages to them if they followed a newly-created route called “prior approval” that has now forced the Council to accept the application with zero affordable homes included.\nOn one calculation, our Borough may have lost up to 500 affordable homes due to that legislation. The latest changes you highlight are further steps on a path that is seriously undermining the efforts of local authorities to help those in dire need of better housing.\nCouncillor Richard Clifton, Chair of Planning Committee, London Borough of Sutton”\nAt the meeting of Sutton Council on 19 January Richard criticised the owners of Sutherland House for their “inertia” in relation to the re-development of the empty building.\nRichard joined with Sutton Councillor Hanna Zuchowska in pointing out that the owners withdrew an application for planning permission that included an element of affordable housing before exploiting recent changes in planning law to get permission for conversion of the building to 128 luxury flats with no affordable housing element. But still, although the building has been empty for five years, they do not get on with the re-development.\nSpeaking after the meeting Richard said “The building is still empty and a blot on the landscape. The development of the Subsea7 building, bringing 800 office jobs to the area, and the improvements associated with the Sutton Gateway project, are giving a lift to the area just south of Sutton station. We need the developers to get on with the renovation of Sutherland House.”\nThe full text of Richard’s speech, seconding a motion on affordable housing, is as follows:\n“In seconding this motion, I would like to draw attention to the opening sentence, which speaks of the widening gap between the rich and the poor.\nI find it astonishing that in my own lifetime the wealth gap between rich and poor has not just failed to diminish but has actually widened.\nThe figures are so astounding one hardly believes them – that the top 80 (eight zero) wealthiest individuals in the world own more than half the world’s wealth, that is they own as much as half the population of the planet.\nAnd in our own country about 30 billionaires own half the wealth of the nation.\nAnd the implications of this inequality are not just a matter of concern for social policy.\nA fascinating study published by the OECD last December showed that countries with a smaller and narrowing gap between rich and poor experienced higher rates of economic growth, and if the gap between rich and poor had not widened in Britain from the 1980’s the UK economy would in fact be 20% larger.\nGeorge Osborne ought to reflect on the reasons for this. If you increase the earnings of the poor they will spend it, creating income, jobs and wealth for others, but if you increase the earnings of the rich they may save much of it. He ought to remember this when he plans yet further raids on the welfare budget, on financial support to the very poorest in society, rather than asking the wealthy to contribute more.\nIt is a finding that demonstrates that the so-called “trickledown” economics so beloved of leaders on the right of the political spectrum – and that included Margaret Thatcher – whereby largesse afforded to the very rich trickled down to help the very poor, was in fact a recipe for lower growth and thus a lower increase in living standards for all.\nWe need concerted policy action to deal with this, and tax rates on the highest earners, property taxes, the minimum wage, and welfare support to the very poor, are all important aspects. But we all know that action and support for those in need can be best targeted if undertaken at a local level.\nHere in Sutton, we will continue to do what we can to build a fairer and more equal society, something of particular importance to us as Liberal Democrats, even if what we can do is sometimes at the most basic level, such as dealing with concerns about food and housing.\nAnd the fact that we have Food Banks, here in Britain, in one of the more affluent countries in the world, makes my point about inequality more eloquently than any of my words can do.\nOn housing, we can be proud of our record in Sutton.\nAs Councillor McCoy told us, the Council is promoting affordable housing, something that is vital when I find that in my own Ward changes to planning law mean that a block like Sutherland House can become 128 luxury flats with no affordable housing requirement atall. If and when the developers finally get on with it, and I deplore their inertia.\nAnd the Council is dealing with homelessness: I was heartened by the serious and concerned tone of the debate at Planning Committee on the proposal to provide short-term accommodation for homeless families in Benhill Road. It was the Committee at its best. This was on an evening – 17 December 2014 – when no less than 76 (seven six) Sutton families were homeless and in bed and breakfast accommodation, often miles from Sutton.\nMr. Mayor, we must continue our efforts as a Council to care for the most needy of our residents, while having a concern – as citizens – to promote policies, at every level, that will increase economic growth but distribute the rewards more fairly.\nI am pleased to second the motion.”",

L’Aubade de Quercy specialise in traditional French folk dancing, performed in traditional costume. The group included ladies who demonstrated lace making, traditional in this part of France.\nPrior to the performance Richard, as Mayor, welcomed the group to a reception in the Mayor’s Parlour, where the dancers from Gagny presented the borough with an emblem made in lace, and Richard presented them with a copy of the Sutton Coat of Arms.",

This year the survey was carried out by M.E.L Research, which surveyed 1,022 residents aged 16+ with quotas set on age, gender and work status to match the profile of the population of Sutton.\nThe percentage of respondents satisfied with how the council runs services in the borough has risen two percentage points in the past two years to 78 per cent. The satisfaction rate for the local area as a place to live has been maintained at 90 per cent compared to 2013.\nThis is despite the council having to save £74m from its annual budget between 2011 and 2019 due to unprecedented Government cuts to its annual budget.\nSo far the council has saved £43m from its annual budget, with the majority of the saving (£32m) being made without frontline services being affected. However the remaining £31m will result in services being changed, reduced and in some cases stopped which is likely to have an effect on future surveys.\nThe council launched the Sutton’s Future campaign in July 2013 to involve residents in making the savings. So far there have been more than 10,000 responses.\nThe campaign looks to have had an effect with a rise in:\n· the percentage of people saying they feel informed about how council tax is spent (48 per cent in 2013 to 65 per cent in 2015)\n· the percentage of people feel informed about Council services and benefits (49 per cent in 2013 to 64 per cent in 2015)\n· the percentage of people that they feel they can influence council-run services (44 per cent in 2013 to 51 per cent in 2015)\nOther survey results included:\n· Most residents (98 per cent) feel safe walking alone during the day in their neighbourhood. After dark, three-quarters (75 per cent) feel sale, compared with 71 per cent in 2013. The level of worry for burglary and antisocial behaviour has continued to decrease since 2011 (48 per cent and 41 per cent respectively to 37 per cent and 35 per cent in 2015).\n· More than half of residents want to know what the Council is doing but do not wish to be involved beyond that, with only 13 per cent wanting to be more involved or have a say in what the council is doing. Of those who want to be more involved or have a say, just over a third (34 per cent) would be willing to complete a questionnaire, 25 per cent to submit their views through an online channel and 28 per cent to attend a public meeting arranged by Sutton Council.\n· The satisfaction level with Sutton Council has risen consistently since 2009, when just under three-quarters (72 per cent) of residents thought the council was doing a good job. Just over six in 10 (61 per cent) agree that the council provides value for money, up from 54 per cent in 2013.\n· Residents on the whole appear to be reasonably satisfied with Council services. Since 2013, resident satisfaction has increased for services such as borough theatres, the arts and events, historic places and museums, playgrounds, sport and swimming facilities, and pavement and road maintenance.\n· However, resident satisfaction has decreased in recycling, down from 85 per cent in 2013 to 77 per cent in 2015, street cleaning from 76 per cent in 2013 to 69 per cent in 2015, refuse collection from 88 per cent in 2013 to 82 per cent in 2015, and parks and open spaces, from 87 per cent in 2013 to 82 per cent in 2015.\n· But resident satisfaction remained the same in 2013 and 2015 in parking (46 per cent), libraries (73 per cent) and street lighting (81 per cent).",

We believe this will be a significant improvement to the park.\nLast year we strongly opposed a scheme to demolish numbers 54 to 58 Overton Road and build an ugly block with inadequate parking. We were pleased when representations we submitted were supported by the Planning Inspectorate after the developer appealed against the decision of Sutton Council to refuse the application.\nRecently the Council’s Planning Committee, which Richard, chairs, considered two applications for this site. The site is now not to be developed as a single block but number 54 will be retained, rather than being demolished, and renovated with parking at the front. Numbers 56 and 58 will be replaced by a small estate of houses, but the design of the houses facing the road will be sympathetic to the street scene and each property will have a garage and parking space. Taking into account the comments of the Planning Inspector on the earlier proposal, the Committee felt this proposal acceptable. This is a satisfactory conclusion to a difficult issue.",

Please see the press release below.”\nCllr Heather Honour\nSt George’s decide not to proceed with merger process\nSt George’s Healthcare NHS Trust have informed us and our strategic authority, NHS London, that they cannot proceed with their bid to merge with St Helier and Sutton hospitals.\nThroughout the process St George’s have been very positive about the strategic opportunity to merge and the benefits this could bring to patients.\nHowever, due to the financial challenges facing hospitals in south west London and the inability to pre-empt the outcome of the Better Services Better Value review, which is looking at how NHS services are provided across south west London, they do not feel able to proceed at this time.\nThis is because the review, which will be open to public consultation, could have a significant impact on the financial income of all hospitals involved.\nSt George’s have however expressed a full commitment to working closely with St Helier and Sutton hospitals in the future.\nJan Sawkins is the Independent Chair of the special Board set up to help St Helier, Sutton and Epsom hospitals to achieve foundation trust status. She said: “Whilst we have always been aware that a bidder could withdraw during the process, at this stage in the transaction it is obviously very disappointing news.\n“The Transaction Board has a meeting scheduled next week (7 February 2012) and we will use this to consider the options and agree a way forward. This may include re-opening tenders for St Helier and Sutton hospitals.”\nMatthew Hopkins, Trust Chief Executive said: “This is disappointing news, but St George’s have been clear to us that their decision is not based on our staff, nor the quality of the services we provide at St Helier and Sutton hospitals.\n“As you would expect, the Trust Board and those working on the transaction have been looking at other options in case this happened and we look forward to discussing these with the Transaction Board next week.\n“Whilst we are making decisions about the long-term future of our hospitals, our priority will – as ever – continue to be ensuring our patients and local people receive the very best services.”\nAsked what this means for Epsom Hospital, Jan added: “It is the current belief that, subject to Ashford and St Peter’s Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust being confirmed as the Preferred Partner for Epsom Hospital, the de-merger could continue whilst we make alternative arrangements for St Helier and Sutton.\n“Whilst this would, of course, need further investigation and approval by the Transaction Board, the Trust Board and others, it is felt that this would be in the best interest of Epsom Hospital, its patients, staff and local people.\n“However, I would emphasise that the priority remains to secure the future of Epsom, St Helier and Sutton hospitals.”\nFor more information about the work of the Trust visit our website: www.epsom-sthelier.nhs.uk. You can also follow us on Twitter (twitter.com/epsom_sthelier) or find us on Facebook (facebook.com/epsomsthelier).\nThis is what St Georges said in their press release:\nSt George’s media statement\nSt George’s Healthcare NHS Trust submitted a bid for a potential merger with St Helier Hospital in November 2011.\nThe board is clear that a merger between St George’s Healthcare and St Helier would be an excellent strategic opportunity, with the potential to bring significant improvements to the care of patients across southwest London and beyond.\nAfter careful consideration the board has reached the conclusion that the current terms of the merger prevent us from proceeding further at this time.\nThe level of financial challenge facing hospitals in south west London, combined with the inability to pre-empt the outcome of a public consultation around the Better Services Better Value (BSBV) review, means this is not the right time for us to progress with the transaction.\nWe want to continue to build on the existing links that are in place for clinical services. We have identified a number of the potential benefits to patients that would occur from an acquisition which could also be delivered if the organisations remained separate legal entities which we shall continue to pursue.\nWe are particularly keen to develop the clinical and academic networks that span St George’s Healthcare and St Helier, and explore opportunities to establish new networks across services, to the benefit of patients.\nA key priority for the trust is to achieve Foundation Trust (FT) status by 2014, and we will focus our efforts on achieving this. The board feels strongly that achieving FT status will strengthen the opportunities for St. George’s Healthcare and St Helier to work together in the future.\nThis is what Ashford and St Peters have had to say:\nStatement re Epsom Hospital\nChief Executive at Ashford and St Peter’s Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Andrew Liles, said:\n“The decision made by St George’s Healthcare NHS Trust not to pursue their bid for St Helier and Sutton hospitals has not changed our position regarding Epsom and we will continue to progress our plans to acquire Epsom hospital (through merger) in line with the process set out by the Transaction Board. Of course this is still subject to approval by the Transaction Board, Epsom and St Helier, the local health authorities and others and by our own Board, who will need to be assured that any final decision is in the best interests of both the Epsom and Ashford and St Peter’s catchment populations.\nAs a Foundation Trust already we feel we are in a strong position strategically to pursue these plans and we know they have already passed through the first stage of the process successfully, meeting the criteria set by local people, stakeholders and staff. These include new and innovative partnerships – with The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, Central Surrey Health and Surrey and Sussex Partnership NHS Trust – to create an integrated healthcare campus at Epsom Hospital, bringing additional services and added benefits to local patients and staff. Our plans are also made more straightforward by the fact that Epsom hospital is not part of the Better Services Better Value review in South West London.\nWe have also had positive initial discussions regarding financial and commissioning support for our plans, although of course final decisions regarding the preferred provider and agreement of financial support are still to be made.”\nFor more information please call the Press Office on: 01932 722163",

THIS ARTICLE IS KEPT ON THE SITE TO SHOW HOW THE PROPOSALS EVOLVED.\nSutton South Councillors have now seen the results of the second stage of\nthe consultation on parking. There was a strong response rate – about half of\nresidents responding in some roads, high for this type of study. The results\nare clear enough for conclusions to be drawn, but raise some issues on which\nsome more detailed information would be helpful.\nThe results for Mayfield, The Ridgway and Chalgrove indicate that residents\nare not happy with the proposals for yellow lines and bays, so might prefer a\nresidents’ permit parking area. Upland Road residents want to join in any scheme for this area, which makes it logical to also include Farm Road. There is concern about the form of the controls, the proposal being for yellow lines where parking is prohibited for a set period on weekdays, and bays where anyone can park. This could lead to competition between residents and commuters for the bays, the bays attracting “longstay” parkers and commuters touring the area looking for bays. The alternative is a Residents’ Parking Area with no yellow lines or bays, but only residents who have obtained a parking permit, or their visitors displaying a Visitors’ Permit, allowed to park in the street for this set period. This would remove commuters, increase the parking available to residents and eliminate the disadvantages described above, though there would be a charge for the permits to cover the administrative costs of the scheme. We\nwould like your views on these options.\nThere was a lower rate of response from Kayemoor Road, Prior Avenue, Willis Avenue, perhaps because the Stage1 proposals for parking controls in The Ridgway and Mayfield Road were thought to have limited implications. We think the displacement of parking, and the fact that numbers of vehicles parked is continuing to gradually increase, could have an impact in the medium to long term, particularly given current housing developments in central Sutton, So there is a case for further consulting residents of these roads, now that the parking control area will be extended to include Upland Road.\nThere will be further consultation.",

At present, each day, about 30 planes fly from London’s airports to destinations in north Germany, carrying about the same number of people as could be carried by just a few trains, using the Velaro D trains that are being built to provide rolling stock for these new services from London, by the train manufacturer Siemens at its Dusseldorf factory, which in fact I visited recently.\nAside from the potential importance of these international links to the residents of Sutton, there are international companies that have significant centres of their enterprises in Sutton – Sutton, a thriving London suburb, offering office space much cheaper than that found in the centre of London, less than half an hour by train from the centre, with a pleasant ambience and environment, and a location from which – importantly – you can reach the centre of Brussels in just two train journeys, one taking about 40 minutes and one about 2 hours. And the centre of Paris in just 15 minutes more. And soon – Amsterdam, north Germany.\nNow, these are transport links that it is vital for Sutton to maintain, for the sake of our residents but also to maintain our attractiveness as a centre for business development. When I look at the data on economic activity that comes regularly to the new Housing, Economy and Business committee, some clear conclusions stand out. It is clear that Sutton is doing relatively well in terms of surviving the recession and maintaining one of the highest rates of economic activity on the part of its residents of any part of London. But we need to continue to attract new businesses.\nThe Tramlink extension is perhaps equally important, particularly in relation to the north Sutton site, which is an attractive site, and on which the Housing, Economy and Business committee now has a task group working on the planning brief. Our current plans include scope for a Tramlink stop at the site, something that will greatly enhance its appeal, and we see this development as an important part of our future growth strategy.\nSo we must keep pressure on TfL to continue work on the feasibility of the Sutton Tramlink proposal, and make clear to the Department for Transport that changes that remove our linoks to north London and in particular to St Pancras, are not acceptable.\nThe Thameslink service is absolutely vital. Losing it would sever our only direct link to North London and would mean Sutton residents would need to take at least two trains to get to St Pancras. It is quite scandalous that, at a time when we should be improving public transport, there is a serious proposal to cut the link between North and South London.”\nWe need to act now as the Department for Transport is currently consulting on the new seven-year Thameslink franchise which will run from September next year and incorporate the Southern franchise from 2015.\nIronically, the cross-London Loop Line service which runs through Sutton, Carshalton and Hackbridge stations, was recently reopened at nights and weekends after being split for three and a half years by engineering work. It is all very well reopening it now, but Sutton’s residents need the line to stay open for good.\nThe new franchise will set service patterns for 2018 and beyond, so it is vital that we act now and do not become a Cinderella area for rail transport.\nTo view the DfT consultation document visit www.dft.gov.uk/consultations\nTo give your input into Sutton’s response, email alex.forrest@sutton.gov.uk\nRichard and Heather will be submitting their own response.\nMore detail about the attitude the Council is taking, opposing this threat, is in a further post on this site “Train Links To North London Must Remain” (see archive July 2011).\nDisgraceful proposal, Sutton is a thriving London borough which needs its essential links to central and north London to maintain and develop its prosperity. I support the comments made by Councillor Richard Clifton’s to the council and the campaign to prevent changes to the current Thameslink loop line services to Farringdon, Kings Cross and St Albans.",

This featured the reminiscences of elderly members of the group, based on a number of themes, such as their experience of evacuation of children during the 1939-45 war.

Hooray.\nA further meeting of the project board guiding the Sutton Gateway project, a board on which Richard represents Sutton South Ward, heard on 25 September that good progress is being made with the scheme.\nThe most important news is that the building work on the side entrance is completed enabling the passageway from The Quadrant to be restored and the side entrance to be opened for passenger use. The side entrance is open from 7am to 7pm.The cycle racks next to the newly opened side entrance have been improved.\nWork at the front of the station commenced in September and will be completed by March 2015, but with no work over the Christmas period to avoid any inconvenience to shoppers. Some of the work will involve traffic diversions.\nThe project’s proposals to further develop the area around Sutton station include:\n– refitted shop fronts, new paving and newly planted trees to improve the look of the area\n– more lighting and CCTV cameras to make the area safer\n– extra cycling facilities, with new bike racks and shelters\n– a town centre clock\n– a new crossing in Brighton Road\n– the opening of the side entrance to Sutton station\n– new “legible London” signs\n– a re-arrangement of the bus stops to reduce congestion\n– an additional crossing for pedestrians outside the station\n– re-design of the Cedar Road / Brighton Road junction to improve visibility for motorists\n– it is not proposed to move the taxi rank, except that after 6.30 some taxis will be able to park immediately opposite the station, with the bus stop opposite the station moved further down Brighton Road and with some buses stopping in Mulgrave Road\n– there will be “live” bus information in Sutton station, subject to further research by Network Rail\n– the timing of the pedestrian crossing at the High Street / Grove Road / Sutton Court Road junction will be amended to give more time to cross\n– the number of parking spaces in the station area will be increased\n– general improvements in design and to the “public realm” around the station, with more flowers, more colour and better signage.\nThe changes, including the changes to the bus stops, will be completed by March 2015.\nThese changes are largely funded by grants the Council has obtained, not local Council tax payers.\nThe results of the earlier consultation exercise on the Gateway Project indicated general support for the scheme, but we were able to make a number of changes to respond to specific issues raised. In our Ward, a particular concern for the businesses was the need for a loading bay on Regents Parade just south of the station. We successfully lobbied for this to be incorporated into the scheme.\nOn 27 February Richard and former Ward Councillor Heather Honour organised a breakfast meeting with local businesses in our Ward to take their views on the Sutton Gateway project. Several joined us in the Rose Café in the Brighton Road, which serves excellent scrambled eggs (Richard’s breakfast). This is right in the area that is to be developed so we were able to chat and walk round the area to see the proposed changes.\nPublic consultation on the emerging proposals ran till 5 March. Consultation was by leaflets in the locality, questionnaires to members of the public, posters, newspaper advertisements, exhibitions, further “stakeholder” meetings and putting information in Sutton station.\nResidents and businesses close to the station were consulted, together with the emergency services and other groups with a major interest such as Network Rail, Southern Rail and TfL.\nAlso of great value will be the “legible London” signs at the station entrance. See the designs at\nhttp://www.tfl.gov.uk/microsites/legible-london/3.aspx\nRichard says “As a local man who for twenty years of my life commuted to central London by a route that meant I walked every working day along Wellesley Road and past the shuttered and barricaded side entrance, to enter the station from the front, it has long been an objective of mine to get the side entrance open. Every second counts when you are a commuter.”",

  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_category_local-services/content_138.html": "On the 27th of January Sutton Council met. Richard raised the issue of the reasons why a recent survey by The Times newspaper ranked Sutton as the eighth most attractive place to live in England. This finding does not surprise us. We spend a lot of time knocking on the doors of our residents to introduce ourselves as your local Councillors and we find people generally say they really like Sutton, mentioning a strong sense of community, open spaces, low crime, good schools, a green and pleasant environment, parks, street trees, being convenient for London and for the countryside. This is particularly the case with people who have moved to Sutton from elsewhere, particularly those from other London boroughs, from Hong Kong and from Ukraine. Please write to us and tell us what you like about Sutton or think we can improve.\nIMPROVING PEDESTRIAN SAFETY IN OUR WARD\nWe are always keen to look at ways of improving our Ward.\nLast year traffic engineers undertook a study of traffic flows in our Ward and the results of the exercise are listed in a later post on this site. The results have not led to some “standout” conclusion as to a problem that needs tackling but traffic officers are examining three main issues:\n- whether action can be taken to improve the safety and the experience of pedestrians crossing the Kings Lane bridge without closing the road to vehicles. The bridge is narrow. Installing a second bridge would be impossibly expensive. Marking a pedestrian path at one side of the road might be feasible. We would welcome the views of users of the bridge, both pedestrians and motorists\n- similarly, whether something can be done to improve the safety and the experience of pedestrians passing under the railway bridge in Langley Park Road. Some proposals are to be consulted on\n- possible improvements to the busy junction where Cedar Road crosses Langley Park Road. Residents have spoken to us of the difficulties pedestrians have in crossing Langley Park Road. Consultation with residents in adjacent streets is underway on proposals to install two new traffic islands in Langley Park Road. These will form a safe area in the middle of the road so the road can be crossed by pedestrians in two phases.\nYour views on these issues, and views on any other traffic and parking issues you would like us to look at would be welcomed.\nFURTHER OPEN, QUARTERLY MEETING OF LOCAL RESIDENTS AND THE POLICE\nThe police met residents of Sutton South Ward again on the evening of 15 January 2025, at Devonshire Avenue school. There are open, public meetings held quarterly at which the police discuss the policing of the Ward with local residents. We were addressed by our Ward Constable, Constable Robyn Skivens, who went through the crime statistics for the Ward. Sutton has a lower crime rate than most outer London boroughs and our Ward has one of the lowest crime rates in Sutton. However, crime always has a significant impact on the victim and public concern remains high. The draft minutes of the meeting are as below.\nSUTTON SOUTH COMMUNITY / POLICE MEETING. 15 JANUARY 2025\nAttended by PC Robyn Skivens and PCSO Helen Maguire for the police.\nA report was given on main crime trends from 1 September to the date of the\nmeeting.\nDRUG OFFENCES\nThere had been 18 drug offences, mainly possession of drugs, mainly cannabis.\nWhile this was higher than normal the increase was partly attributable to a\nspecial police operation at Sutton train station.\nFour of these crimes were the interception by the Border Force of drug\nshipments. Where such a shipment is to premises in our Ward it will count in\nour statistics.\nBURGLARY\nThere had been 21 burglaries or attempted burglaries. This included residential\nburglaries, burglaries of garages and sheds, and some burglaries of businesses.\nIt was noted that there was usually a seasonal increase in burglary at this time\nof year as it was darker earlier.\nThere had been eight residential burglaries. However, some that had been\nreported in sheltered accommodation in the Ward were later disproved and\nattributed to dementia. A disturbing case was that of a landlord who was able\nto let himself into a flat and commit theft. Two burglaries of garages had\ninvolved theft of bicycles.\nMention was made of a shop in Brighton Road where the window was\nsmashed and the wooden panel that was then put in place to secure the\npremises was pulled away to facilitate burglary. Mention was made of the\ntheft of tools from a construction site in the Ward.\nSome burglaries had involved the theft of keys, which were then used to\ncommit further offences (theft of a car key leading to theft of a car). The police\nstressed the need to make sure keys were kept out of sight – if the keys can be\nseen from your letterbox you are inviting crime.\nVEHICLE CRIME\nThere had been 14 instances of vehicle crime (theft of vehicles, damage to\nvehicles, theft from vehicles). The police stressed the need to avoid leaving\nanything of value on display in your car, or in the car at all. An unusual crime\nhad been the theft of an excavator and a dumper from the road works in\nBrighton Road.\nTHEFT\nThere had been 23 crimes in a category the police described as “theft and\nkindred (to theft)” events. This included shoplifting, parcel theft, theft of pedal\ncycles and mobile phones. Examples mentioned included theft of scrap metal,\ntheft of a wheelie bin and theft of a wedding ring by distraction techniques.\nMAJOR CRIMES\nThere had been nine major, violent crimes in the Ward. This included several\nrobberies at the train station, a large group altercation outside a restaurant, a\nfight between two drug users, and a concerning incident of a woman who was\nfollowed from the station and robbed. There were also two incidents of arson,\nof a bin and of a Ford transit. A ULEZ camera was deliberately damaged.\nThere was an incident where a drug user was searched and a knife, and bladed\narticles, were found to be in his possession.\nThere was a disturbing incident of an anti-semitic symbol being daubed on a\nwall outside the synagogue in Cedar Road. There had been a succession of\nincidents related to a woman living in Cedar Road who had engaged in anti-\nsocial activities that had attracted a community of drug users to her premises.\nThis was now the subject of police reports to the DPS that were expected to\nlead to her being charged with serious offences.\nSPEEDING\nThe police had been conducting a programme of visits to local care homes and\nsheltered housing to talk about scams. Residents had raised with them\nconcerns about speeding in Cavendish Road, which had led to police action in\nthat road. There was a discussion of speeding in local roads including\nChalgrove Road, Langley Park Road, The Ridgway and Cavendish Road. The\npolice had been carrying out speed checks in Chalgrove Road and Cavendish\nRoad. The action in Cavendish Road had led to twelve drivers receiving\nwarnings. The police would consider further action against speeding in local\nroads, subject to resources.\nOTHER MATTERS DISCUSSED\nStaffing levels: There should be in theory be a third officer on the Ward to\nsupport Robyn and Helen, but they were coping.\nThe number of “extractions” when they were called away to join police\nexercises elsewhere in London, or at the Croydon custody suite, remained an\nissue of concern but was now running close to 35% of their time rather than\nthe 50% it had once been.\nMention was made of local concern about a story that a body had been\ndiscovered at a house in Egmont Road. The police assured the meeting that\nthere was no wider implication of this incident.\nThe next meeting was tentatively scheduled for Wednesday 14 May at Devonshire Avenue school (7pm) subject to the police checking their work rota.\nThe meeting thanked Robyn for coming back from leave to attend the meeting\nand thanked the officers for their work for the community in dealing with\ncrime in the Ward. The meeting thanked Fiona Ostler for letting us meet at the school. The date of the next meeting was provisionally set as Wednesday 14 May, at Devonshire Avenue primary school and thought continues to be given to what could be done to better publicise the meeting and get a better attendance.\nSUPPORTING THE POLICE CADETS\nSutton South Councillors were concerned to learn about changes proposed to the organisation of the Police Cadets, who meet at a school in our ward. Currently there are over 120 cadets. However, the decision has been made to close junior cadets and cut the remaining senior cadets to just 46. Their future programme is also being severely curtailed. This will have a major impact on the youth of this borough who will no longer have the opportunity to participate in activities such as camps, parades and Duke of Edinburgh awards.\nCouncillor Louise Phelan, whose son has been a Cadet, commented “I’ve seen first-hand the benefits of being part of police cadets. They learn valuable life skills, and gain self confidence. They also support the local community and get to take part in things they wouldn’t otherwise have had the opportunity to do. For many this is a stepping stone into a career within the police force, for others the Cadets help to keep them on the right path and make better life decisions. I am incredibly concerned others will now not get these opportunities.”\nKINGS LANE\nRichard has been trying to get Network Rail to cut back the vegetation on the railway bank adjacent to the southern bridge in Kings Lane as it obscures sight lines for motorists. Every autumn, after the vegetation on the railway bank has grown up, he has this correspondence with Network Rail. They have now cut back the undergrowth sufficiently for cars to be able to see if there are vehicles coming towards them across the bridge.\nNOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR SUTTON: PLANNING APPLICATION IN MULGRAVE ROAD TURNED DOWN\nThe owner of Chelsea Court, 54 Mulgrave Road has had planning permission to extend the building – in effect adding two extra floors to the block of flats – refused by Sutton Council. This was the latest in a series of applications in our Ward where owners of blocks of flats have sought to extend the building upwards.\nAs local Councillors, we were concerned about these proposals. While there is a need for more accommodation, the changes to the building would in our view make it look incongruous, not good enough for Sutton. The block is an attractive architect-designed building (see photo), one of the more attractive blocks in Mulgrave Road, and the proposed changes would destroy the symmetry of the building. The Planning Department at Sutton Council agreed with our objections. The changes would also have involved building work that would greatly disturb the current residents of the block.\nThe owners used a mechanism called “prior approval” when submitting their planning application. This mechanism, in our view, was introduced by the Government to undermine the planning system. As a result, we could take the application to the Council’s Planning Committee, which Richard chairs, for decision by Councillors. We may still not be able to stop these changes taking place given the powers of the remote Planning Inspectorate based in Bristol to over-ride local decisions.\nWe always seek to ensure in such cases that a number of conditions are stipulated in any planning permission, if one is ever granted, to try to protect the peace and quiet of the building during construction work. These include that access to the roof should be via an external hoist with all materials for work on the roof transported to the roof by an external hoist and not brought up via the well of the building. The interior of the building should not be a storage area or building site. There should be a construction management plan to minimize disruption to existing residents and ensure there are controls on dust and noise, and on hours of work. The contractors should join the Considerate Contractors’ Scheme. There should be a liaison officer that residents can contact if they observe poor behaviour. If scaffolding is erected outside residents’ windows it should only be erected when needed and removed as soon as it is not needed.\nWe have successfully opposed this development but wait to see if the developer will appeal to the Planning Inspectorate against the decision of the Council.\nA VISIT TO CITY HALL TO PRESENT SUTTON’S PETITION OPPOSING THE EXTENSION OF ULEZ\nLouise, Richard and Trish travelled to City Hall, the HQ of London Mayor Sadiq Khan, on 30 June to join other Sutton Liberal Democrat Councillors in presenting a petition to the Mayor. The petition, signed by over 10 000 Sutton residents, expressed our opposition to the extension of the ULEZ zone to outer London boroughs. Our views on why we opposed the extension of ULEZ can be found in posts further down this site.\nDespite our opposition, ULEZ has now been extended by the London Mayor to outer London.\nTACKLING GRAFFITI IN SUTTON SOUTH WARD\nThis picture shows Louise and Trish cleaning off the graffiti we found in the area outside Northumberland House in Brighton Road. We want residents to report to us instances of graffiti, which is one of the scourges of our times, worldwide. In general, the Council has a good record in cleaning off graffiti quickly. A difficulty is when the graffiti is on private property and the owners of the property have responsibility.\nHere is an example of graffiti we got cleaned off, on the bridge at Kings Lane.\nNEW ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING POINTS PLANNED FOR MULGRAVE ROAD\nIn support of our policies to combat global warming and reduce carbon emissions, the programme to fit electric vehicle charging points in lampposts in our Ward continues. A further consultation exercise is about to take place on the installation of two new electric vehicle charging points in Mulgrave Road, close to the junction with Worcester Road. A preliminary consultation found majority support but few residents responded.\nThere are now charging points at the following locations:\nOpposite 49 The Ridgway\nOpposite 26 Langley Park Road\nOpposite Foxley Court in Christchurch Park\nOpposite 10 Cumnor Road\nIn Cedar Gardens\nOpposite Grange Court, Grange Road\nOpposite Thomas House, Grange Road\nOpposite 13 Stanley Road\nOpposite Fairford Court, Stanley Road\nWe want to draw attention to the Sutton Citizen space survey where residents should log their suggestions for EV charge points.\nhttps://sutton.citizenspace.com/highways-environment-and-planning/ev-survey/\nThe photo shows the first vehicle that used the first charging point in the Ward, in The Ridgway. Given the policy to ultimately phase out petrol driven vehicles, a big and continuing expansion will be needed.\nSutton Council is working with Siemens to install Ubitricity lamp column electric vehicle charging points. Ubitricity lamp column charging points are compact and fit into the door of a lamp column.\nThe aim of lamp column charging is to give residents the ability to easily charge electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles on the street where they live, especially if they do not have off-street parking or are unable to install their own home charging point. Installing residential charging points is important because a key barrier to people switching to electric vehicles is the concern around where they will be able to charge their vehicle.\nNot all lamp columns are suitable for lamp column charging points. The lamp columns need to be “electrically suitable”, be positioned near the kerb and have enough internal space to fit the charging point. They need to be sensibly located so that a vehicle could safely park and charge next to the lamp column. The lamp columns also need to be made of metal, not concrete.\nAn “earth mat”, a small metal grid, is also installed in the footway next to the lamp column. This is to make the charging point “electrically safe” if there is a fault. There are signs to indicate that the lamp column has a charging point fitted, though this sign will not prevent non-electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles from parking next to the lamp column.\nThis is a major advance in our drive to promote electric vehicles and combat global warming.\nOUR CLIMATE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\nSutton Council has declared that there is a climate emergency and at the Council meeting on 16 January we adopted a progress report entitled “Environment Strategy and Climate Emergency: Progress Report and Update.” In his speech on this important report Richard pointed out that far from being some vague affirmation of worthy sentiments the report was packed full of detailed, positive actions we had taken and could be proud of. He listed some of them\n– ten new school streets\n– 120 dockless ebikes (although we came quite late to the concept of ebike schemes compared to many London boroughs)\n– double the number of new trees planted than our target\n– seven parks received the green flag award for their biodiversity management with butterfly banks in the parks\n– almost 7 000 teaching sessions on biodiversity, mostly to school age children\n– the work of the Sutton Nature Conservation Volunteers, the Community Environment Champions Network, the Green Enterprise partnership\n– the Healthy Homes Advice and Support Service, providing assessment of homes for energy efficiency\n– promoting green spaces, energy efficiency and electric vehicles through our planning policies and decisions\n– LED street lighting and electric vehicle charging points in street lamps\n– promoting re-cycling of waste\n– the promotion of initiatives to support locations where items can be repaired and re-used\n– action to deal with extreme weather events\n– promoting the cycling network and cycle maintenance and safety workshops\n– travel plans for our own staff to promote cycling and walking, and switching our own vehicles to electric.\nThe list goes on and on.\nThis is an important programme based on positive, practical steps we are taking to protect the environment.",

For this reason Richard took great pleasure in accepting an invitation from the Ahmadiyya Muslim Association to attend their mosque in Willow Lane in Sutton on the evening of 15 June to break fast with them at sundown, during the holy month of Ramadan. In this photo he is inside the mosque with Nasser Butt, former Liberal Democrat Councillor for this Ward, on the left as you look at the picture, and, to the right, Naseer Dean, President of the London region of the Association.\nTrish has also accepted several invitations to attend the Central Mosque in Carshalton Road and took part in the Sutton Peace March on 1 July. She was invited to attend Friday prayers at the mosque the previous day to pass on information about the Peace March.\nNEW WASTE COLLECTION ARRANGEMENTS\nWe are well aware that the new arrangements have not worked as well as they should in some parts of the Ward. We have been working with Veolia to iron out some problems, particularly with bin stores at certain blocks of flats, and pressing them to improve the regularity of the service where it has fallen short.\nA PERSONAL STATEMENT FROM RICHARD\nAbout a week before I was elected Mayor in May 2016 I went to child-mind my grandson, something I have done every week so my daughter and son-in-law could go out to work. I found my daughter ill and took her to the doctor, who told me to take her immediately to the nearby accident and emergency department at St Thomas’s hospital. We arrived at noon and by 5pm they had diagnosed a brain tumour requiring immediate surgery.\nIf I had known of her illness about a week earlier I would have pulled out of being Mayor. But everything was set up and it was too late. In retrospect, that would have been a bad decision as the work involved in being Mayor was a great distraction over a very difficult twelve months. I stood down as Mayor on 22 May 2017 and the following day Jane was taken in by St Christopher’s hospice in Sydenham, where she died on 9 June.\nGloria and I have been overwhelmed by the expressions of condolence and support we have received, from so many local residents. Can I thank you all.\nRICHARD\nTACKLING SPEEDING ON THE ROADS OF SUTTON SOUTH\nRICHARD COMPLETES HIS YEAR AS MAYOR\nRichard completed his year as Mayor, and Gloria her year as Mayoress, on 22 May. Richard raised over £26 000 for his charity appeal for Sutton Shopmobility and the Alzheimer’s Society.\nIn the course of his Mayoral year Richard attended several hundred events in the Borough. The range of these events is enormous. They include:\n- opening the various open-air festivals, carnivals and fêtes that are held in Sutton in the summer months\n- opening new shops, pubs and business premises\n- attending events at churches, mosques, the synagogue and schools\n- attending school prizegiving evenings at most of our schools in Sutton\n- taking part in many Citizenship ceremonies, at which local residents from distant parts of the world took British citizenship\n- attending many 100th birthday parties\n- attending scout camps\n- attending award ceremonies, particularly for young people and for the many groups of cadets – police cadets, sea cadets, air cadets and the combined cadet forces of some of our schools\n- turning on the Christmas lights, which he did four times.\nAnd of course hundreds of events organised by the many voluntary groups in Sutton. And going to a few football and cricket matches, not just Sutton United but many local teams who have invited him to their games and to give out the awards at end-of-season prizegivings.\nHe has also represented the Borough at important events in London and in Surrey where the Borough should be represented, ranging from the pan-London Citizenship Ceremonies organised by the Mayor of London to more poignant occasions such as the service at Westminster Abbey to remember those killed in the terrorist action in Westminster last March.\nHe has also held receptions in the Mayor’s Parlour for about a dozen groups of people whose contribution to Sutton needs to be recognised – including carers, the local business community, food bank volunteers, the arts network, and of course Sutton United Football Club.\nRichard recollects that there was a day in March when, in one day, he opened the new Poundland store in Sutton town centre, opened the Red Lion pub in Hackbridge which had been closed for re-furbishment, attended a 100th birthday party for a local resident, and held a reception for food bank volunteers in the Mayor’s Parlour. And there were two other invitations on that day that he had to pass to his Deputies as he could not fit them in. This demonstrates the demands on his time\nRichard has had to do some challenging things as Mayor, including dressing up as Father Christmas to go out with the Sutton and Cheam Rotary Club collecting money for charity. This has left him with a rich fund of anecdotes about his discussions with small children when dressed as Father Christmas, which he offers to regale people with.\nRichard sometimes had to chair the Annual General Meetings of local groups who have it in their constitution that the Mayor will chair their AGM. Chairing Council meetings is sometimes a bit tricky, so you would think that chairing the meetings of bodies like the Sutton Swimming Association, Sutton Seniors Forum and the Friends of Whitehall would be a doddle. It was not always so.\nRichard said when he was elected that he hoped his Mayoralty would be remembered for some good music. There have been some great concerts to support his charity appeal, including by The Surrey Yeomanry Band, the Sutton Youth Wind Orchestra, The Phoenix Concert Band, the Norwood Wind Ensemble and the Show Choir – not to mention the group of musicians led by Richard that played Christmas carols in the St Nicholas Centre on several Saturdays before Christmas to raise funds, and the performance by the Clockhouse Choir at one of his dinners. Councillor Wendy Mathys attended all his concerts so deserves a special prize.\nIt has to be said that 2017 was a good year to be Mayor of Sutton as the year will be remembered as ranking alongside 1970 (remember Leeds United) and 1989 (remember Coventry City) as a year when Sutton United football club achieved great things in the FA Cup. The Mayor was one of the people guaranteed a ticket for the Sutton United v. Arsenal match, when the team acquitted themselves with honour, so a good year to be Mayor. There was worldwide interest in the Arsenal match, so much so that before the match he was much in demand for interviews on the general theme of “where is Sutton?”. He was interviewed by radio and TV teams from, amongst other places, Turkey, Russia and South Korea.\nRichard’s charity appeal has raised over £26 000 for his two excellent charities.\nOUR LOCAL BOBBY – CONSTABLE MARK TOWLER\nMany Sutton South residents will know our principal neighbourhood police officer, Police Constable Mark Towler. Mark has for many years been our Police Constable, a man who knows our area like the back of his hand and who has made a great contribution to keeping the local community safe. While nowhere has zero crime and we can never be complacent, the borough of Sutton is one of the safest in London and Sutton South Ward one of the safest Wards in Sutton.\nOn 11 May Richard attended, as Mayor of Sutton, the Metropolitan Police Service Sutton Borough Commander’s Commendation Ceremony, where a number of serving police officers from Sutton and some members of the public received awards in recognition of their service to our community. The Mayor is invited to present these awards. This service ranged from acts of bravery to prevent crime to systematic action and campaigns to reduce crime. We are delighted that PC Towler received an award, recognising his work to reduce crime in our area, the citation reading “commended for motivation, commitment and drive to reduce anti-social behaviour in Sutton South ward linked to the supply of drugs, through the use of search warrants and arrest of offenders, improving the quality of life for his residents.”\nA VERY SPECIAL LOCAL RESIDENT\nOn 30 March one of the oldest residents of our Ward, Ethel Hansford, celebrated her 100th birthday. Congratulations Ethel. Ethel once worked at Croydon airport, and now lives in Thomas House in Grange Road. Ethel is mobile and has many great recollections of her interesting past.\nRichard had a very busy day. In the morning he opened the new Poundland store in Sutton. There was a queue of over 100 waiting to go in when the store opened. This was not the only new establishment in Sutton that he opened on that day, opening the refurbished Red Lion pub in Hackbridge that evening. In the afternoon he attended Ethel’s 100th birthday party. Later in the evening he hosted a reception for food bank volunteers in the Mayor’s Parlour.",

To ensure a consistent approach throughout the Borough, all local schemes will be drawn into a central strategy and progressed on the basis of an assessment of priorities.\nAn ambitious scheme for the introduction of a 20mph scheme across most of the area of Sutton South Ward west of the Sutton to Belmont railway line has now been included in the “Local Implementation Plan” prepared by Transport for London. This was the subject of proposals put to the local committee in 2015. However, it is on the “reserve list” which means that implementation in the near future is most unlikely.\nA parking scheme for the newly-named Berridge Close is agreed, implementation to coincide with the opening of the adjacent Subsea7 building, as this will lead to more intensive use of the road by those working in the building and accessing the underground car park. Obstructive parking in Berridge Close could lead to problems when the building is occupied, so needs to be avoided. It is proposed that the road will be included in the controlled parking zone with four parking bays in the road, reserved for residents with parking permits. Completion of the building is unlikely before December.\nTraffic and parking schemes were the subject of a session at the December 2015 meeting of the South Sutton, Cheam and Belmont Local Committee, when residents noted down parking and traffic problems. A list of the proposals raised by residents was reported back to the local committee meeting on 10 March.\nIn relation to our own area, the proposals fell into three main categories.\nFirst, concerns about intensive and sometimes obstructive parking in Mayfield Road and roads nearby (The Ridgway, Chalgrove Road, Upland Road).\nSecond, concerns about visibility at the Farm Road / The Ridgway junction.\nThird, a set of other concerns, mostly about speeding at various locations.\nThis listing will form the agenda for further work by the traffic department within a wider cross-Borough study, which is centrally managed by the Council. A number of minor, initial proposals were agreed on 10 March, including to restrict parking at the Prior Avenue / Banstead Road junction due to visibility issues.\nThe question of a parking control scheme in Mayfield Road and the surrounding area was the subject of a consultation exercise by local Councillors last year which showed support in Mayfield Road but not adjacent roads. On 10 March the local committee agreed to devote some of its public realm funds to fund the traffic department to “kick start” a study of potential for parking controls in this area. A discussion between traffic engineers and Ward Councillors to consider this study was held on 8 June in Mayfield Road. The traffic engineers will design a parking control scheme for consultation. The precise parameters of this scheme and the consultation have yet to be finalised. Consultation with residents is due to begin in January 2017.\nSome residents of Audley Place have commented to us that there is difficulty when driving out of Audley Place in seeing vehicles coming down Camborne Road, if cars are parked close to the corner. We raised this issue with traffic engineers and the Council is proposing a small extension of the yellow lines on each side at the exit from Audley Place. We think this will do the trick in terms of making it easier, and safer, to drive out into Camborne Road.\nResidents of Tapestry Close have complained to us about obstructive parking in the Close. We raised this issue with traffic engineers and a scheme of yellow lining was proposed. Further consultation with residents, required by law, found some residents objecting and this scheme is currently on hold.\nSeveral schemes consulted on some time ago have now been implemented, including yellow lining at the bottom of Downside Road to deal with obstructive parking (see photo above) and switching some “pay and display” bays to “dual use” so residents with parking permits can use them, in Grange Road and Langley Park Road.",

He said:\n“We all know the importance to Sutton of maintaining a through rail service to north London.\nI want to stress the importance of links to St Pancras International as St Pancras develops further as an international rail hub.\nOver the next few years there will be a positive mushrooming of international rail travel from London. If the current plans of Deutschbahn and Eurostar come to fruition, by 2014 it will be possible, on arriving at St Pancras, to have a choice of services to travel from London to Amsterdam.\nIn addition to the current services to Brussels and Paris there will also be services from London to North Germany. This is a big market in terms of business travel. At present, each day, about 30 planes fly from London’s airports to destinations in north Germany, carrying about the same number of people as could be carried by just a few trains, using the Velaro D trains that are being built to provide rolling stock for these new services from London, by the train manufacturer Siemens at its Dusseldorf factory, which in fact I visited recently.\nAside from the potential importance of these international links to the residents of Sutton, there are international companies that have significant centres of their enterprises in Sutton – Sutton, a thriving London suburb, offering office space much cheaper than that found in the centre of London, less than half an hour by train from the centre, with a pleasant ambience and environment, and a location from which – importantly – you can reach the centre of Brussels in just two train journeys, one taking about 40 minutes and one about 2 hours. And the centre of Paris in just 15 minutes more. And soon – Amsterdam, north Germany.\nNow, these are transport links that it is vital for Sutton to maintain, for the sake of our residents but also to maintain our attractiveness as a centre for business development. When I look at the data on economic activity that comes regularly to the new Housing, Economy and Business committee, some clear conclusions stand out. It is clear that Sutton is doing relatively well in terms of surviving the recession and maintaining one of the highest rates of economic activity on the part of its residents of any part of London. But we need to continue to attract new businesses.\nThe Tramlink extension is perhaps equally important, particularly in relation to the north Sutton site, which is an attractive site, and on which the Housing, Economy and Business committee now has a task group working on the planning brief. Our current plans include scope for a Tramlink stop at the site, something that will greatly enhance its appeal, and we see this development as an important part of our future growth strategy.\nSo we must keep pressure on TfL to continue work on the feasibility of the Sutton Tramlink proposal, and make clear to the Department for Transport that changes that remove our linoks to north London and in particular to St Pancras, are not acceptable.\nThe Thameslink service is absolutely vital. Losing it would sever our only direct link to North London and would mean Sutton residents would need to take at least two trains to get to St Pancras. It is quite scandalous that, at a time when we should be improving public transport, there is a serious proposal to cut the link between North and South London.”\nWe need to act now as the Department for Transport is currently consulting on the new seven-year Thameslink franchise which will run from September next year and incorporate the Southern franchise from 2015.\nIronically, the cross-London Loop Line service which runs through Sutton, Carshalton and Hackbridge stations, was recently reopened at nights and weekends after being split for three and a half years by engineering work. It is all very well reopening it now, but Sutton’s residents need the line to stay open for good.\nThe new franchise will set service patterns for 2018 and beyond, so it is vital that we act now and do not become a Cinderella area for rail transport.\nTo view the DfT consultation document visit www.dft.gov.uk/consultations\nTo give your input into Sutton’s response, email alex.forrest@sutton.gov.uk\nRichard and Heather will be submitting their own response.\nMore detail about the attitude the Council is taking, opposing this threat, is in a further post on this site “Train Links To North London Must Remain” (see archive July 2011).\nHeather and Richard outside Sutton station",

After going through a process of public review by a Government Inspector, the plan was presented to and agreed by the Housing, Economy and Business Committee on 13 February. Richard addressed the Committee on what he saw as the virtues of the plan. The plan was endorsed by Council on 26 February and Richard again addressed the meeting, reminding Councillors that the process of public review – which can lead to major revision of such plans – left it virtually unscathed. The core policies of the plan survived without alteration, and are the central policies that have helped us maintain the pleasant, green, suburban character of Sutton our residents cherish. This is evidence of the strength of the document.\nThe plan supports development that is in keeping with the best in our local environment – preserving the green, suburban feel of Sutton while meeting the aspiration to have homes for our children to grow up here. The plan promotes good quality design, school places, the London Cancer Hub, surgeries, the protection of pubs, parks and open spaces, and minimum standards for housing. It also strengthens the protection of Conservation Areas and Areas of Special Local Character. It is our plan for a successful Sutton.",

The ceremony was attended by Trish and other Councillors, including the Leader of Sutton Council, Councillor Dombey.\nSubsea7 are an offshore exploration and technical support company, and they had brought one of their submarines from Aberdeen to the building to show it to guests. Paul Rosier, of Subsea7, gave the audience a potted history of the site, including information on the famous people who had once lived on the site. These included the famous engineer Harold Berridge, who invented techniques for measuring the strength of concrete, after whom the adjacent road has been named Berridge Close.\nSubsea7 had considered re-locating from Sutton to an adjacent Borough, but their staff were keen to remain in Sutton. They wanted a purpose-built new office building and purchased the site in order to build an HQ to their own design. They have closed their office in Hammersmith to concentrate their staff in Sutton, and will eventually expand to employ up to 900 staff at the site.\nIn opening the building Richard said “This is great moment for Sutton. This is one of the most attractive new buildings in our town and the decision of Subsea7 to locate their headquarters here will be of massive benefit to the local economy, bringing jobs and prosperity to local shops, restaurants and hotels. As a Councillor for this Ward, I have supported this project throughout.”",

Galbraith, a hero of mine, coined the phrase “private affluence and public\nsqualor”, pointing out that society spends enormous sums of money on some goods\nand services while services that are collectively funded by society are\ngenerally kept very short of money, something he ascribed, rightly, to the obsession\nof the political right with cutting taxes and reducing the size of the state.\nIn modern Britain,\nwe undoubtedly have this phenomenon – made much worse by austerity.\nThe collectively funded services that in my view society\nfails to fund adequately include education, hospitals, social care, social\nhousing, welfare, help for the homeless, children’s services, libraries, and\nsupport for children with special educational needs.

And also some\nservices that those on the political right might also want to spend more money\non, like the welfare of the armed services.\nWe need more support for public services but we know that\nin Tory Britain we will not get it, which makes setting a responsible and well\ntargeted budget of such great importance.\nWhat stands out from this budget statement is the responsibility\nshown.\nWe are raising revenue, insofar as we can\nWe are not relying on raiding further our meagre reserves.\nWe are concentrating spending on the priorities that help\nthose in most need.\nThere is a lot of Government rhetoric about at the moment\nabout ending austerity, but if you look at the actuality of Government policy\nand spending commitments it remains overall highly fiscally restricted, with\nmuch made of a boost in what is a limited number of areas.\nThe reality is that over the last ten years our core central Government funding has been reduced by more than 60% in real terms and we continue to face unprecedented financial pressures as a result of grant reductions, underfunded new burdens from central Government and increased demand for services – due to demographic pressures and the impact of austerity, particularly cuts in welfare support for those in poverty.\nWhile we’re managing with less, more people than ever need\nour help – child poverty has grown, more people are using food banks.\nAbout two thirds of our spending is on support to\nvulnerable adults and children – including on caring for older people, “looked\nafter” children, and people with learning and physical disabilities who need\nhelp to live independently.\nThe way our expenditure is skewed in this way, skewed by\nour statutory obligations but also our wish to concentrate spending on those in\ngreatest need, is something that I think is not widely realised by our\nresidents, most of whom are of course not consumers of those services.\nAnd it concerns me that if you look at the Council’s risk\nstatement there are areas where the Council faces difficulty in meeting even its\nstatutory obligations – including homelessness, provision for those with\nSpecial Educational Needs, Homecare services, and support for child asylum\nseekers.\nBut we are an authority pursuing highly responsible\npolicies to keep our head above water and maintaining the absolute priority\npolicies that help the most vulnerable\nSo my feeling is we can be proud of this budget is – the\nthemes being\n1 there are major problems to be tackled\n2 there is a very responsible approach and\n3 there are policies to support those in greatest need.”",

Having successfully coped with a surge in demand for primary school places, the bulge is now moving through to secondary schools. The Council continues to work on its proposals for at least one new secondary school in Sutton, while almost all of the existing secondary schools – including Overton Grange – are submitting plans to expand the number of places.\nOverton Grange school is the only secondary school in our Ward and, while it takes students from all over Sutton, many local parents send their children there. Like many Sutton schools, it is planning to expand its intake to meet the additional demand for secondary school places in the Borough due to rising numbers of children. Currently the school takes in 210 students each year and it plans to expand the school by increasing its intake by a class of 30 each year from autumn 2016.\nThe school, which has “Academy” status so it is not under the control of the local authority, staged an exhibition of its building plans on 22 April, at the school. A new teaching block is proposed, and the school is taking the opportunity of the building work to expand its canteen, which is not large enough for the current size of the school.\nAt the time of the last local elections, last May, scare stories were put round that the school planned to expand into Overton Park. This is not the case.\nRichard said, after the Planning Committee decision ” The rising number of children reaching secondary school age means that expansion of our schools is necessary, alongside the proposals for new schools, and I am pleased the Council is taking effective action to avert any crisis in school places. I am pleased there is no intention to expand into the park, a story that had no foundation and was a political scare story.”\nOverton Grange plans to expand its intake by 30 pupils per year, a one form intake, from the autumn of 2016. The Planning Committee considered a report on an application for the erection of a part ground, part first, part second floor extension, to provide five additional classrooms with ancillary accommodation, three single storey extensions to provide additional canteen, kitchen and storage facilities, together with roof canopy to the main front entrance, a detached store, with soft and hard landscaping.\nOverton Grange is a popular local school and this extension will continue to ensure there are sufficient places locally for children reaching secondary school age, so this is good news for the many parents in the area who have young children. Secondary school provision in the area will be further enhanced by the decision to build the first of the new secondary schools we need on the nearby Sutton hospital site.",

The snow usually melts fairly quickly on the pavements on the north side as this gets sun during the day, but the pavements on the south side are shaded by tall buildings like Fiske Court, so the snow lingers and hardens to ice. This is a particular problem as on the south side there are several blocks of sheltered housing for the elderly, Fiske Court and Richard Sharples House.\nResponding to requests from residents of Fiske Court, Richard has several times been to Cavendish Road and himself cleared the pavement of snow. Now, we have discussed the problem with Council officers and got a new grit bin put in place outside Fiske Court. This will help deal with the problem if the snow returns.\nOur picture shows Richard with Lee, who delivered the bin and filled it with grit.",

Decisions about healthcare are taken by the local NHS organisation not Ministers. In the event that the final decision taken was challenged it could be referred to the Secretary of State for Health for a final decision.\nAs local Councillors who have used the services of St. Helier hospital, we oppose this decision. Heather has already been particularly active in opposing it as a member of the Joint Health Overview and Scrutiny Committee for south west London. On 15 May we joined our MP Paul Burstow in a demonstration against the decision at St. Helier hospital (in the photo above you can see Heather, Paul and Richard in front of the hospital).\nPaul Burstow, has raised serious concerns about the way in which the Better Services Better Value review, and the talks about a merger with St Georges, have been handled. Treated as completely separate discussions, in fact they directly impacted on each other.\nAt this point no final decisions have been taken. Whilst important, the panel’s recommendations are not binding and mark the beginning of a process which will include a public consultation, expected in early autumn.\nLocal LibDems have previously fought to save St Helier and in 2010 secured £219m to refurbish and rebuild the hospital.\nPaul Burstow comments:\n“This is a flawed conclusion from a flawed process. There is still a lot of water to flow under the bridge before final decisions are made.\nThe panel have ignored the pressure on all the A&Es and maternity units in south west London.\nA cloud has gathered over St Helier but I believe we can mount a successful challenge to the assumptions that have led the panel to this conclusion.\nWe have saved St Helier before, and we will fight to do so again.”\nClick here to sign our petition organised by local LibDems, on the website of Paul Burstow.

In each case a car had collided with the tree and this had led to the tree being lost. One could see the ugly patch of brown earth left in the grass verge, where the tree had once been. Further investigation revealed that there had been a similar incident in Effingham Close leading to the loss of a tree.\nCouncillor Clifton persuaded Sutton’s chief arborculturalist, Ben Morris, to visit Copse Hill with him. It has taken a little while but in January new trees were planted to replace those lost in Copse Hill, in the exact same places as the trees that were lost, while two new trees have been planted outside 18 and 34 Efingham Close.\nCouncillor Clifton has appealed to residents of the roads to ensure the young trees are watered in dry weather.\nWhile assisting residents in Copse Hill, our attention was drawn to the potential problem of the flooding of the road in periods of very heavy rain, as the water flows down Effingham Close to the bottom of the hill. After discussion with engineers in the Highways Department, action was taken to install a new drain gully at the foot of the hill. We hope this has resolved the problem of the flow of water down the hill. There remains a more minor problem with the puddles outside numbers 2 to 10 Copse Hill. Gerry McLaughlin of the Highways Department is shown here marking out changes to the gulleys. There will be a programme of cleaning out the soakaways over the summer and it is hoped that this problem is resolved.\nCouncillor Clifton visits Copse Hill for a discussion with Gerry McLaughlin.",

There were interesting presentations on the Holocaust and some discussion of other acts of genocide, including those in Rwanda, Bosnia and Dafur.\nTRISH GETS THE FLOWER DISPLAY RENEWED\nTOP MARKS FOR SUTTON SOUTH POLICE\nSUTTON SOUTH WARD POLICE/COMMUNITY PANEL MEETING 5 JANUARY 2016\nTrish and Richard attended their first local meeting of 2016 when they attended the consultative panel for Sutton South Ward set up by the police, on January 5, in Christchurch hall.\nThe police had reported at the previous meeting that that there had been a further fall in the total number of crimes in our Ward in the most recent three month period, a fall of 1.5% compared to the period a year previously. The downward trend has continued and data were presented to the meeting to show that the number of residential and non-residential burglaries in the last four months are down compared to the figures for the corresponding period in 2014. Sutton South Ward continues to have one of the lowest crime rates in London. It will be difficult to reduce it further.\nPriorities remain tackling burglary, anti-social behaviour and speeding. The police are continuing to conduct some evening and night patrols with the objective of tackling rough sleepers in certain blocks of flats.\nThe threat to the future of PCSOs (Police Community Support Officers, the backbone of our neighbourhood policing approach) remains a matter of concern.\nAn exercise to test public satisfaction with the police has found that satisfaction rates are highest in Sutton, of all London boroughs.\nSATISFACTION WITH THE COUNCIL HAS INCREASED, SURVEY SHOWS\nAlmost 8 in 10 people feel Sutton Council is doing a good job and 9 in 10 are satisfied with their local area as a place to live, an independent borough-wide survey has found.\nThe data comes from an independent bi-annual survey commissioned by the council to analyse public perception of the borough. This year the survey was carried out by M.E.L Research, which surveyed 1,022 residents aged 16+ with quotas set on age, gender and work status to match the profile of the population of Sutton.\nThe percentage of respondents satisfied with how the council runs services in the borough has risen two percentage points in the past two years to 78 per cent. The satisfaction rate for the local area as a place to live has been maintained at 90 per cent compared to 2013.\nThis is despite the council having to save £74m from its annual budget between 2011 and 2019 due to unprecedented Government cuts to its annual budget.\nSo far the council has saved £43m from its annual budget, with the majority of the saving (£32m) being made without frontline services being affected. However the remaining £31m will result in services being changed, reduced and in some cases stopped which is likely to have an effect on future surveys.\nThe council launched the Sutton’s Future campaign in July 2013 to involve residents in making the savings. So far there have been more than 10,000 responses.\nThe campaign looks to have had an effect with a rise in:\n· the percentage of people saying they feel informed about how council tax is spent (48 per cent in 2013 to 65 per cent in 2015)\n· the percentage of people feel informed about Council services and benefits (49 per cent in 2013 to 64 per cent in 2015)\n· the percentage of people that they feel they can influence council-run services (44 per cent in 2013 to 51 per cent in 2015)\nOther survey results included:\n· Most residents (98 per cent) feel safe walking alone during the day in their neighbourhood. After dark, three-quarters (75 per cent) feel sale, compared with 71 per cent in 2013. The level of worry for burglary and antisocial behaviour has continued to decrease since 2011 (48 per cent and 41 per cent respectively to 37 per cent and 35 per cent in 2015).\n· More than half of residents want to know what the Council is doing but do not wish to be involved beyond that, with only 13 per cent wanting to be more involved or have a say in what the council is doing. Of those who want to be more involved or have a say, just over a third (34 per cent) would be willing to complete a questionnaire, 25 per cent to submit their views through an online channel and 28 per cent to attend a public meeting arranged by Sutton Council.\n· The satisfaction level with Sutton Council has risen consistently since 2009, when just under three-quarters (72 per cent) of residents thought the council was doing a good job. Just over six in 10 (61 per cent) agree that the council provides value for money, up from 54 per cent in 2013.\n· Residents on the whole appear to be reasonably satisfied with Council services. Since 2013, resident satisfaction has increased for services such as borough theatres, the arts and events, historic places and museums, playgrounds, sport and swimming facilities, and pavement and road maintenance.\n· However, resident satisfaction has decreased in recycling, down from 85 per cent in 2013 to 77 per cent in 2015, street cleaning from 76 per cent in 2013 to 69 per cent in 2015, refuse collection from 88 per cent in 2013 to 82 per cent in 2015, and parks and open spaces, from 87 per cent in 2013 to 82 per cent in 2015.\n· But resident satisfaction remained the same in 2013 and 2015 in parking (46 per cent), libraries (73 per cent) and street lighting (81 per cent).\nTHE CHRISTMAS SPIRIT\nFor the third year in a row Richard helped arrange for one of his bands, the Phoenix Concert Band, to come to the Friends’ Meeting House in Cedar Road on the second Saturday in December to play a concert of Christmas tunes and Christmas carols. See if you can see Richard, who plays trumpet with the band, in one of the the photos. The Phoenix Concert Band comprises sections of flutes, clarinets, saxes, brass and percussion, about 30 members when all turn up. There is a tea for senior citizens every second Saturday of the month at the Friends’ Meeting House. Richard’s band is already booked to play a concert there on 11 June 2016.\nSUTTON COUNCIL FREE GRIT SCHEME AGAIN A GREAT SUCCESS\nAnd Sutton’s car parks were crowded over the weekends before Christmas due to the Council repeating its policy of not charging for using its car parks over weekends in the run-up to Christmas.\nThe Gibson Road multi-story car park in Sutton town centre and several other car parks across the Borough, including Carshalton High Street, Kingsway Cheam, and Wallington Library, offered free parking.\nSCHOOL PLACES FOR LOCAL CHILDREN ASSURED\nSutton Council’s Planning Committee, which Richard chairs, has agreed expansion plans for Overton Grange school, the only secondary school in Sutton South Ward.\nSutton Council, like every London Borough, has been pursuing a strategy to cope with the increased demand for school places. Having successfully coped with a surge in demand for primary school places, the bulge is now moving through to secondary schools. The Council continues to work on its proposals for at least one new secondary school in Sutton, while almost all of the existing secondary schools – including Overton Grange – are submitting plans to expand the number of places.\nOverton Grange school is the only secondary school in our Ward and, while it takes students from all over Sutton, many local parents send their children there.

The side entrance is now open from 6am to 11pm seven days a week. The cycle racks next to the side entrance have been improved and the number of racks doubled.\nThe project further developed the area around Sutton station with:\n– newly planted trees to improve the look of the area\n– more lighting and CCTV cameras to make the area safer\n– extra cycling facilities, with new bike racks and shelters\n– the town centre clock\n– a re-arrangement of the bus stops to reduce congestion\n– re-design of the Cedar Road / Brighton Road junction to improve visibility for motorists\n– after 6.30 some taxis can park immediately opposite the station, with the bus stop previously opposite the station moved further down Brighton Road to ease congestion of buses at peak times\n– the timing of the pedestrian crossing at the High Street / Grove Road / Sutton Court Road junction has been amended to give more time to cross\n– the number of parking spaces in the station area has been increased\n– general improvements in design and to the “public realm” around the station, with more flowers, more colour and better signage\n– new “legible London” signs based on this design, still to be installed.\nThese changes are largely funded by grants the Council has obtained, not local Council tax payers.\nThe results of the earlier consultation exercise on the Gateway Project indicated general support for the scheme, but we were able to make a number of changes to respond to specific issues raised. In our Ward, a particular concern for the businesses was the need for a loading bay on Regents Parade just south of the station. We successfully lobbied for this to be incorporated into the scheme.\nThe improvements attributable to the Gateway project are complemented by the installation of the new zebra crossing in Cedar Road, which was not part of the project.\nMORE DAFFS IN OVERTON PARK\nWELCOMING NEW CITIZENS\nOn 21 October Trish and Richard participated together at a Citizenship ceremony to welcome new British citizens, held at the Sutton Registrar’s office in Worcester Road, in our Ward. We had new citizens from India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Nigeria, South Africa, China and Iraq. Richard made a speech welcoming the new citizens and stressing what they can add to multi-cultural Britain.\nOn 26 November Richard participated in a further event when new citizens came from Iraq, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bulgaria, Poland, South Africa and Nigeria.",

AND YOU ARE WELCOME TO ATTEND THE PUBLIC MEETINGS OF THE POLICE CONSULTATIVE PANEL, DETAILS BELOW.\nREPORTING CRIME\nIn Sutton you can call 101 to report a crime that has already happened, seek crime prevention advice or make the police aware of any issues in your local area. Using 101 for situations that do not require an immediate police response helps keep 999 available for when there is an emergency. An emergency is a crime happening now or immediate danger.

These are open meetings all residents can attend. We advertise these meetings on our website. Attendance at the meetings is lower than we would like or expect given concerns about crime. Reports on meetings are provided below. During the pandemic the panel met infrequently.\nSUTTON SOUTH COMMUNITY / POLICE MEETING. 15 JANUARY 2025\nAttended by PC Robyn Skivens and PCSO Helen Maguire for the police.\nA report was given on main crime trends from 1 September to the date of the\nmeeting.\nDRUG OFFENCES\nThere had been 18 drug offences, mainly possession of drugs, mainly cannabis.\nWhile this was higher than normal the increase was partly attributable to a\nspecial police operation at Sutton train station.\nFour of these crimes were the interception by the Border Force of drug\nshipments. Where such a shipment is to premises in our Ward it will count in\nour statistics.\nBURGLARY\nThere had been 21 burglaries or attempted burglaries. This included residential\nburglaries, burglaries of garages and sheds, and some burglaries of businesses.\nIt was noted that there was usually a seasonal increase in burglary at this time\nof year as it was darker earlier.\nThere had been eight residential burglaries. However, some that had been\nreported in sheltered accommodation in the Ward were later disproved and\nattributed to dementia. A disturbing case was that of a landlord who was able\nto let himself into a flat and commit theft. Two burglaries of garages had\ninvolved theft of bicycles.\nMention was made of a shop in Brighton Road where the window was\nsmashed and the wooden panel that was then put in place to secure the\npremises was pulled away to facilitate burglary. Mention was made of the\ntheft of tools from a construction site in the Ward.\nSome burglaries had involved the theft of keys, which were then used to\ncommit further offences (theft of a car key leading to theft of a car). The police\nstressed the need to make sure keys were kept out of sight – if the keys can be\nseen from your letterbox you are inviting crime.\nVEHICLE CRIME\nThere had been 14 instances of vehicle crime (theft of vehicles, damage to\nvehicles, theft from vehicles). The police stressed the need to avoid leaving\nanything of value on display in your car, or in the car at all. An unusual crime\nhad been the theft of an excavator and a dumper from the road works in\nBrighton Road.\nTHEFT\nThere had been 23 crimes in a category the police described as “theft and\nkindred (to theft)” events. This included shoplifting, parcel theft, theft of pedal\ncycles and mobile phones. Examples mentioned included theft of scrap metal,\ntheft of a wheelie bin and theft of a wedding ring by distraction techniques.\nMAJOR CRIMES\nThere had been nine major, violent crimes in the Ward. This included several\nrobberies at the train station, a large group altercation outside a restaurant, a\nfight between two drug users, and a concerning incident of a woman who was\nfollowed from the station and robbed. There were also two incidents of arson,\nof a bin and of a Ford transit. A ULEZ camera was deliberately damaged.\nThere was an incident where a drug user was searched and a knife, and bladed\narticles, were found to be in his possession.\nThere was a disturbing incident of an anti-semitic symbol being daubed on a\nwall outside the synagogue in Cedar Road. There had been a succession of\nincidents related to a woman living in Cedar Road who had engaged in anti-\nsocial activities that had attracted a community of drug users to her premises.\nThis was now the subject of police reports to the DPS that were expected to\nlead to her being charged with serious offences.\nSPEEDING\nThe police had been conducting a programme of visits to local care homes and\nsheltered housing to talk about scams. Residents had raised with them\nconcerns about speeding in Cavendish Road, which had led to police action in\nthat road. There was a discussion of speeding in local roads including\nChalgrove Road, Langley Park Road, The Ridgway and Cavendish Road. The\npolice had been carrying out speed checks in Chalgrove Road and Cavendish\nRoad. The action in Cavendish Road had led to twelve drivers receiving\nwarnings. The police would consider further action against speeding in local\nroads, subject to resources.\nOTHER MATTERS DISCUSSED\nStaffing levels: There should be in theory be a third officer on the Ward to\nsupport Robyn and Helen, but they were coping.\nThe number of “extractions” when they were called away to join police\nexercises elsewhere in London, or at the Croydon custody suite, remained an\nissue of concern but was now running close to 35% of their time rather than\nthe 50% it had once been.\nMention was made of local concern about a story that a body had been\ndiscovered at a house in Egmont Road. The police assured the meeting that\nthere was no wider implication of this incident.\nThe next meeting was tentatively scheduled for Wednesday 14 May at Devonshire Avenue school (7pm) subject to the police checking their work rota.\nThe meeting thanked Robyn for coming back from leave to attend the meeting\nand thanked the officers for their work for the community in dealing with\ncrime in the Ward. The meeting thanked Fiona Ostler for letting us meet at the school. The date of the next meeting was provisionally set as Wednesday 14 May, at Devonshire Avenue primary school and thought continues to be given to what could be done to better publicise the meeting and get a better attendance.\nSUTTON SOUTH WARD COMMUNITY/POLICE MEETING – WEDNESDAY 25 SEPTEMBER 2024\nHeld at Devonshire Avenue primary school. Constable Skivens gave an update on crime in the Ward since the last meeting, which was on 26 June 2024.\nBurglaries: There had been 8 burglaries. Several were burglaries of garages but there had been some of houses and of commercial premises. There was a gang of four people who were now well known in the borough who had been behind a number of burglaries.\nMotor Vehicle Crime: 11 crimes were reported – 3 of theft of cars (in Ambleside Gardens, Albion Road, Farm Close). The other offences were thefts from, damage to or interference with cars. There were again no catalytic converter thefts.\nDrug offences: 5 crimes were reported, one of possession of cannabis and one of possession with intent to supply. The other offences were importation of drugs intercepted by Border Force where a local address was given for the consignment. Ward police would then have to visit the address but usually this was a fictitious or convenience address.\nViolence against women and girls: 4 cases. These included a man exposing himself on a bus and cases of women being followed.\nMajor crimes: This is a broad category. There were 4 cases – two robberies, one attempted robbery, one case of a threat to kill.\nOther crimes: There were 11 in this miscellaneous category, including:\n- 2 of shoplifting from the BP service station\n- 2 pedal cycles stolen\n- A woman who had an epileptic fit outside Sutton station had her bag stolen\n- A “street drinker” at the station had vapes stolen from him\n- A handbag was left on a bus and stolen, and efforts were made to use the bank cards\n- The theft of a wedding ring through distraction techniques (engaging in conversation to distract),\nStaffing: Although Sutton South has a cadre of 3 officers – Constable Skivens, a second Constable and a PCSO – Constable Skivens was currently on her own. The other Constable is on restricted duties due to a hamstring injury and the PCSO has an injured knee. Constable Skivens spends about half her time on “extractions”, usually to the Response Team, to undertake other duties outside the Ward. The meeting expressed concern at the staffing level.\nThe meeting discussed a variety of issues raised by residents:\n- The success of Operation Nightingale in reducing crime in Sutton by monitoring and patrolling selected crime hotspots\n- The reduction of crime at Sutton station by closing the side entrance at certain times\n- The knife amnesty, and its success\n- Drug dealing, including at Sutton Court and Beauclere House\n- Concerns about “street drinkers” at Sutton station\n- Fire safety, including the threat posed by batteries on scooters and electric bikes\n- The importance of reporting crime (it was pointed out that reports via Crimestoppers are anonymous)\n- Keyless cars: the need to keep keys in a tin\n- The police speed traps in Chalgrove Road, including on 5 June\n- The cuts to the police cadets, which meet at Overton Grange school, and the reasons for this action. Councillor Clifton mentioned that the Councillors with the local MP were planning to take this up with the Metropolitan police at a more senior level.\nThe date of the next meeting was set as Wednesday 15 January, at Devonshire Avenue primary school. There was a discussion of what could be done to better publicise the meeting and get a better attendance.\nThe meeting thanked Constable Skivens for her work and for coming in on her day off to present her report to us and Devonshire Avenue school for hosting the meeting..\nSUTTON SOUTH WARD POLICE/COMMUNITY MEETING 26 JUNE 2024\nThe police consultative panel for Sutton South Ward met again on the evening of 26 June 2024, at Devonshire Avenue school. There are open, public meetings held quarterly at which the police discuss the policing of the Ward with local residents. We were addressed by our Ward Constable, Constable Robyn Skivens, who went through the crime statistics for the Ward. We remain concerned that these meetings, chaired by our local Neighbourhood Watch co-ordinator, are not well attended. Sutton has a lower crime rate than most outer London boroughs and our Ward has one of the lowest crime rates in Sutton. However, crime always has a significant impact on the victim and public concern remains high.\nThe police reported that in the period since the committee last met on 24 April there had been 19 burglaries in the Ward. These were mainly of garages and the police are concerned about the security of blocks of garages adjacent to blocks of flats.\nThere had been 12 incidents of damage to vehicles, though six were associated with the activities of a disgruntled ex-employee of a local firm. There were no thefts of motor vehicles and again no incidents of theft of catalytic converters.\nThere were a small number of more major offences, including robbery and public order offences around Sutton train station. There were some incidents of shoplifting, bicycle thefts and youths smoking cannabis. There was some discussion of what the police can do about the group of “all day drinkers” who frequent Sutton station, who had recently congregated at the seat in Bridge Road.\nSUTTON SOUTH WARD POLICE/COMMUNITY PANEL MEETING 24 APRIL 2024\nThe police consultative panel for Sutton South Ward met on the evening of 24 April, at Devonshire Avenue school. We were addressed by our Ward Constable, Constable Robyn Skivens, who went through the crime statistics for the Ward.\nDuring the period from the turn of the year there had been 18 burglaries in the Ward. Many of these were the burglary of garden sheds and the many garages in the Ward. There were 12 incidents involving motor vehicles – theft from or of vehicles. There had been no thefts of catalytic converters. There were 10 other thefts – mainly parcel or phone thefts, or of pedal cycles. There were a small number of robberies around the train station. The police have continued to organise patrols around the station.\nThere had been 5 drug offences recorded. There had been 4 “dog incidents” – dogs being dangerously out of control or biting people. There were 3 incidents involving the harassment of women and girls, offences the police take very seriously.\nSUTTON SOUTH WARD POLICE/COMMUNITY PANEL MEETING 11 OCTOBER 2023\nThe Sutton South Ward Police Consultative Panel met on the evening of 11 October. These are open, public meetings all residents can attend. We were addressed by our Ward Constable, Constable Robyn Skivens. Her colleague Constable Owen Harding often attends but was involved in work for his University course. Constable Skivens set out the crime statistics from 1 July this year to the present. This meeting was much less well attended than the previous meeting, held on 19 July at the Friends’ Meeting House in Cedar Road. Prior to this, meetings were held at Christchurch in Christchurch Park, but this is now unavailable.\nGiven the level of public interest in crime it is disappointing that these meetings are not better attended and there was discussion of how to increase attendance. A provisional date of Wednesday January 10 was agreed for the next meeting, venue to be determined, and it was agreed that approaches would be made to Ward-based churches, residents’ groups and schools to see if attendance could be increased.\nDuring the period from 1 July there had been 21 burglaries in the Ward. This included 9 residential burglaries, 5 burglaries of garages and 4 burglaries of commercial premises – including a vape shop and a barbers. These are investigated by a specific Sutton borough burglary team. CCTV evidence including evidence from doorbell cameras is useful to the team. There had been 25 incidents involving motor vehicles, including 9 thefts of vehicles, 7 thefts from vehicles and 4 thefts of number plates. Interestingly, there had been no catalytic converter thefts. The important advice is not to leave anything valuable in your car and be careful to check it is locked when you leave the car. One resident at the meeting said he had accidently left the car unlocked one evening and money had been stolen from the car. There was one parcel theft, one robbery, one offence involving possession of an offensive weapon and four incidents classified as violence against women and girls, including stalking. These offences are a London-wide priority for the Met at this time. The police always stress the need to report all crime, however trivial.\nConstable Skivens commented on the number of “extractions” when she and Constable Harding are asked to leave Ward duties and assist in activities elsewhere. This reduces attention to Ward matters. Recently this has included hospital guarding and re-assurance patrols in Wallington following the murder on the Roundshaw estate. There is still a vacancy for a PCSO in the Ward team.\nA further meeting was provisionally arranged for 10 January 2024.\nSUTTON SOUTH WARD POLICE/COMMUNITY PANEL MEETING 19 JULY 2023\nThis meeting was attended by 15 people and was held at the Friends’ Meeting House in Cedar Road as Christchurch is unavailable. Constable Robyn Skivens and her colleague Owen Harding reported on the most recent crime trends, since 1 April.\nThee had been two serious assaults in the Ward. There had been 16 burglaries though mostly of sheds and garages – 2 residential burglaries. There had been 21 incidents of motor vehicle crime, mostly damage to vehicles or theft from a vehicle. Interestingly, there had again been no catalytic converter thefts. There had been two arrests related to possession of cannabis, one dog attack, a mobile phone theft from the Anytime Gym, a theft of headphones at Northumberland House. The police stressed the need to report all crime, however trivial an incident might seem. There was some concern about incidents at Overton Grange school, and an incident at the Devonshire Avenue Nature Area. The report triggered a wide ranging discussion.\nA further meeting was provisionally arranged for 18 October, at Overton Grange school.\nSUTTON SOUTH WARD POLICE/COMMUNITY PANEL MEETING 19 APRIL 2023\nThe Sutton South Ward Police Consultative Panel held a successful and well attended meeting on the evening of 19 April. We were addressed by Constable Robyn Skivens and her colleague Owen Harding, who set out the crime statistics from 1 January this year.\nIn the Ward, there had been 11 burglaries, though many of these were burglaries of sheds or garages. There were 26 motor vehicle crimes, mostly theft of contents from vehicles. There were 6 robberies or attempted robberies, mostly the snatching of mobile phones by young men, sometimes school children. There had been 9 “parcel thefts” – thefts of parcels left on doorsteps by delivery firms.\nInterestingly, there had been no catalytic converter thefts or incidents of what are classed as violence against individuals, including domestic violence. However the spike in robberies at the start of the year was concerning and there is no room for complacency. It can be concluded, though, that compared to other parts of London Sutton South Ward remains a relatively low crime area.\nConstable Skivens reported that the staffing on the Ward is now up to the complement of three officers, though they were sometimes called away to activities outside the Ward, such as policing demonstrations. The meeting discussed a number of local incidents, what could be done about computer crime and a variety of other matters including the problems associated with e-scooters.\nA further meeting is arranged for Wednesday 19 July, though the venue is to be confirmed.\nSUTTON SOUTH WARD POLICE/COMMUNITY PANEL MEETING 11 JANUARY 2023\nThe panel met again, chaired by Raj Kondipalli, our Sutton South Ward Neighbourhood Watch co-ordinator, on 11 January 2023, at Christchurch hall. Constable Robyn Skivens presented data on crime levels in the Ward – in the period from 1 October there were 2 residential burglaries in our Ward. There were 32 instances of motor vehicle crime, a worrying increase, and 3 robberies. These involved theft of mobile phones and laptops. There were four instances of theft of catalytic converters. There was one instance of grievous bodily harm, though this concerned an altercation between school pupils outside Sutton station during which one sustained a minor injury. While any crime is too much crime, the data indicate that Sutton South Ward remains a low crime area by comparison to the outer London average.\nSUTTON SOUTH WARD POLICE/COMMUNITY PANEL MEETING 12 OCTOBER 2022\nThe panel met, chaired by Raj Kondipalli, our Neighbourhood Watch co-ordinator, on 12 October 2022, at Christchurch hall. Constable Robyn Skivens presented data on crime levels in the Ward – in the period from 1 July there were 5 residential burglaries in our Ward, though this included theft from a bike shed and one instance of theft of a parcel from a front door. There were 14 instances of motor vehicle crime and one robbery. There were four instances of theft of catalytic converters. While any crime is too much crime, the data indicates that Sutton South Ward remains a low crime area by comparison to the outer London average. The police mentioned the initiative of the Commissioner on violence against women. There was again an interesting discussion on what can be done about speeding in local roads.\nSUTTON SOUTH WARD POLICE/COMMUNITY PANEL MEETING 20 JULY 2022\nAfter a significant gap, the panel met again, chaired by Raj Kondipalli, our new Neighbourhood Watch co-ordinator. Constable Robyn Skivens presented data on crime levels in the Ward – in the period from 1 April 7 garage burglaries, 4 residential burglaries, 28 instances of motor vehicle crime, 12 major crimes such as domestic violence and including one robbery. Seven of the motor vehicle crimes involved theft of catalytic converters, seven were theft of a motor vehicle, 11 theft from a motor vehicle. There was an interesting discussion of catalytic converter thefts and on what can be done about speeding in local roads. The group meets again on 12 October in the hall at Christchurch. – all residents are welcome.\nSUTTON SOUTH WARD POLICE/COMMUNITY PANEL MEETING 8 OCTOBER 2021\nThe panel met for the first “in person” meeting since 16 June 2019, on Friday 8 October at the hall at Christchurch, in Christchurch Park. There was a good turnout with about 20 residents attending. The police team was led by Constable Robyn Skivens. The police reported that crime in the area remains low with, in the period since 1 July, just one burglary, 8 thefts of motor vehicles and 14 thefts from motor vehicles. There was a wide-ranging discussion covering issues including how to ensure people report crime, abandoned vehicles, e-scooters (their use other than on private land is unlawful), anti-social drinkers and the successful use by the police of Community Protection Orders. The likely impact on crime from having more people working at home was also noted. It was agreed that, while the Metropolitan police have had a bad press recently and the issues exposed by the Sarah Everard murder are of genuine importance and concern, in Sutton South the performance of our local police officers has been exemplary. The panel will meet again on 28 January.\nSUTTON SOUTH WARD POLICE/COMMUNITY PANEL MEETING 18 MARCH 2021\nAfter a gap of a year and nine months due to the pandemic, at last a further meeting of the panel. This was restricted, as it had to be by Zoom. There were just the Councillors and three police officers. Delighted to learn nothing much has changed – Sutton South is still a low crime area. We discussed garage burglaries, catalytic convertor thefts, speeding, how to enforce the new 20 mph speeding limit in roads to the east of the Ward. Further meetings planned when we can get back in person in July (we all hope).\nSUTTON SOUTH WARD POLICE/COMMUNITY PANEL MEETING 16 JUNE 2019\nTrish and Richard attended the meeting of the police consultative panel for Sutton South Ward. Held at Christchurch hall, there was a disappointing turnout of residents, just six residents plus two police officers, the Councillors, and the chair. Two of the residents represented residents’ associations. The good news was that there are now more staffing resources allocated to the Ward and the crime figures are stable after a period when there was an increase that caused us concern. There was an interesting discussion, not for the first time at these meetings, of the problem of homelessness and rough sleeping, and its causes. There may be a public perception that rough sleepers are more likely to be involved in crime, but no evidence for it.\nSUTTON SOUTH WARD POLICE/COMMUNITY PANEL MEETING 8 MARCH 2019\nThis meeting was chaired by Amie Stacey, who lives in Upland Road and has recently been appointed Ward Co-ordinator for Sutton South. The police were represented by PCSO Laura Jagoe, from Sutton South Ward and PC Adam Nawol from Cheam Ward.\nNon-urgent contact details for the Safer Neighbourhood Team (SNT): suttonsouth.snt:met.police.uk; 020 8721 2497; 07920 233862.\nThe police reported that in the period December to March, there were 16 burglaries and 21 vehicle crimes in Sutton South Ward. Common methods of entry included getting over a back gate and entering from the rear of the premises by breaking a door or window. We were advised to link a burglar alarm to a call centre, rather than rely on a neighbour. Car thefts were mainly opportunist, some people forgetting to lock their cars. Drugs were not viewed as a big problem, incidents being very sporadic and tackled quickly, after which the drug sellers would move on to somewhere else.\nAs usual, the police SNTs are seriously undermanned. Over the 4 wards, viz. Sutton South, Cheam, Belmont and Sutton West, there are 1 sergeant, 5 PCs, of whom only 3 are “operational” and 3 PCSOs. There are supposed to be 8 PCs, 2 per ward. We were told that there is a PCSO recruitment campaign. Great concern was expressed by all at the meeting and letters will be sent by Neighbourhhod Watch to MPs and the Mayor of London.\n999 calls are handled by an Emergency Response Team.\nLisa Webster, Road Co-ordinator for Upland Road, reported her success in bringing residents of that road together through social events including a “Community Cuppa” meeting on 6th March at her house, 101 Upland Road, to which 26 people came between 1.30 and 3 p.m.\nSUTTON SOUTH WARD POLICE/COMMUNITY PANEL MEETING 29 NOVEMBER 2018\nThe first meeting for a long time as the summer meeting was cancelled at a late point due to it being on the evening of one of the football matches England were involved in in the World Cup. A meeting that left us feeling worried. An increase in crime, in burglaries and thefts from motor vehicles, was reported for the first time for some time. This may not be unrelated to problems of police numbers following the merger with Croydon and Bromley. There are a significant number of unfilled posts, vacancies, that the police are struggling to fill, particularly PCSOs. These are important for work on community relations. One member of staff is about to be moved to work in Croydon, though she did not request this move, and we are again losing our Dedicated Ward Officer. Kellie Heath is also being moved to Croydon.\nSUTTON SOUTH WARD POLICE/COMMUNITY PANEL MEETING 24 APRIL 2018\nA better attended meeting, the highlight being an animated discussion of what can be done to deal with anti-social behaviour outside Sutton station, particularly the racist abuse of the owner of the flower shop. Crime remains low in the area. The staffing problems of the local police force have been ameliorated somewhat. Concern was expressed about the merger of Sutton, Bromley and Croydon police forces as resources will be drawn away from low crime Sutton to higher crime Croydon, but it seems this is to go ahead come what may.\nSUTTON SOUTH WARD POLICE/COMMUNITY PANEL MEETING 30 JANUARY 2018\nNot a well attended meeting, but the first chaired by our new chair Frank Berry. Crime remains low. Homelessness is on the increase nationally and here in Sutton and the meeting discussed measures to deal with it. There was concern at staffing levels, with one PC post unfilled for some time and the PCSO away on maternity leave.\nSUTTON SOUTH WARD POLICE/COMMUNITY PANEL MEETING 31 OCTOBER 2017\nThe meeting learned that our new Dedicated Ward Officer, PC Kellie Heath, is fitting in to her role and has been very active in meeting local community groups. Although the revised policing model promised by Borough Commander Mark Lawrence promises two Dedicated Ward Officers, supported by a PCSO, by the end of 2017, Kellie is at the moment something of a one woman band.\nWe were delighted that Frank Berry, who lives in Christchurch Park and was formerly chair of the Sutton Federation of Residents and Tenants’ Associations has agreed to chair future meetings.\nThe meeting ran through the crime statistics for the last three months. A theme in the four burglaries from houses was windows left open, and in motor vehicle crime carelessness about locking vehicles and leaving SatNavs on display inside the car. Other themes discussed at the meeting were incidents of rough sleeping in stairwells of blocks of flats. The meeting agreed that police priorities should continue to be burglary, anti-social behaviour and speeding.\nThis consultation meeting was much better attended than recent meetings in this series so our efforts at publicity are bearing fruit.\nSUTTON SOUTH WARD POLICE/COMMUNITY PANEL MEETING 11 JUNE 2017\nAt the Sutton South Ward consultative meeting with the local police on 11 June we learned that our long serving PC, Mark Towler, is moving to other duties. There is a new policing model being adopted and our Ward will be under Sergeant Anna Smith – who also covers Cheam, Belmont and Sutton West – but with two dedicated Ward officers – Kellie Heath and Andy Peak – plus a PCSO (Laura Jagoe, who has been with us a long time but is currently on maternity leave).\nWe recorded our grateful thanks to Mark, who will be missed. This is a picture of Mark when he received an award for his work from Richard, during Richard’s year as Mayor.\nThe meeting heard that Sutton South remains a low crime area with just two house burglaries, though four garage burglaries, in the previous twelve weeks. The sector priorities remain tackling burglary, anti-social behaviour and speeding, while for our area we asked the police to continue to keep an eye on drug use at certain addresses, speeding and action to deal with all-day drinking.\nSUTTON SOUTH WARD POLICE/COMMUNITY PANEL MEETING 10 JANUARY 2017\nTrish and Richard attended the Ward police consultative committee meeting on 10 January. The police again reported that crime in our area remains low.\nIn the final quarter of 2016 there were 3 residential burglaries in our Ward (down from 6 in the corresponding period a year previously), 3 non-residential burglaries (down from 7), 7 thefts from motor vehicles (down from 12) and 2 thefts of motor bikes.\nThe police had executed a number of drug searches in the last quarter, which they felt had had a positive impact. Priorities continue to include drugs, looking out for rough sleepers in stairwells of blocks of flats, anti-social behaviour at bus stops, speeding checks and aggressive begging around Sutton station.\nThe police consultative panel next meets at Christchurch hall in Christchurch Park on 9 May. This is a public meeting. See if you can come.\nThere were several “Speedwatch” events in the last quarter, some involving students from Overton Grange school, using a speed gun to catch and warn speeding motorists.\nSUTTON SOUTH WARD POLICE/COMMUNITY PANEL MEETING 12 JULY 2016\nOn 12 July Trish and Richard attended the police consultative group meeting for Sutton South Ward, held in the church hall at Christchurch. It is a pity these public meetings attract so few members of the public, only four tonight. The police priorities for the next quarter will include seeking Neighbourhood Watch co-ordinators at Farm Close and Audley Place, and tackling the problem of rough sleepers in Ambleside Gardens and Beauclere House, in Brighton Road. There was also discussion of the theft of bins at blocks of flats in Brighton Road and in Christchurch Park.\nSUTTON SOUTH WARD POLICE/COMMUNITY PANEL MEETING 19 APRIL 2016\nTrish and Richard attended the Police / Community Ward panel meeting held on 19 April. The panel expressed concern over a spate of burglaries, particularly in the area of The Ridgway and Mayfield Road.\nThis was the first meeting for our new sergeant, Sergeant Nicholson, who was previously working in Brixton. He commented on the fact that the number of burglaries in our Ward in the previous six months was 23, compared to over 200 in the area he came from in Brixton. Despite the current spate of burglaries we remain a low crime area with residential burglaries low in number.\nPriorities for the police in the immediate future will be:\n- Patrolling, visits and advice in the affected area of The Ridgway, Mayfield and Cedar Road\n- dealing with drugs at Sutton Court\n- dealing with night sleepers at Beauclere House in Brighton Road.\nSUTTON SOUTH WARD POLICE/COMMUNITY PANEL MEETING 5 JANUARY 2016\nTrish and Richard attended their first local meeting of 2016 when they attended the consultative panel for Sutton South Ward set up by the police, on January 5, in Christchurch hall.\nThe police had reported at the previous meeting that that there had been a further fall in the total number of crimes in our Ward in the most recent three month period, a fall of 1.5% compared to the period a year previously. The downward trend has continued and data were presented to the meeting to show that the number of residential and non-residential burglaries in the last four months are down compared to the figures for the corresponding period in 2014. Sutton South Ward continues to have one of the lowest crime rates in London. It will be difficult to reduce it further.\nPriorities remain tackling burglary, anti-social behaviour and speeding. The police are continuing to conduct some evening and night patrols with the objective of tackling rough sleepers in certain blocks of flats.\nThe threat to the future of PCSOs (Police Community Support Officers, the backbone of our neighbourhood policing approach) remains a matter of concern.\nAn exercise to test public satisfaction with the police has found that satisfaction rates are highest in Sutton, of all London boroughs.\nSUTTON SOUTH WARD POLICE/COMMUNITY PANEL MEETING 13 OCTOBER 2015\nTrish and Richard attended the meeting of the consultative panel for Sutton South Ward set up by the police, on October 13, in Christchurch hall. This was the fourth meeting held in public and there was an almost full attendance of members but no members of the public.\nThe police reported that there had been a further fall in the total number of crimes in our Ward in the most recent three month period, a fall of 1.5% compared to the period a year previously. The police officers attending the meeting complained that this was still below the target figure set by the Mayor of London’s policing unit, but that as Sutton South Ward has one of the lowest crime rates in London it would be difficult to get down the the figures they have proposed as targets.\nPriorities remain tackling burglary, anti-social behaviour and speeding. The police reminded us of their “Autumn nights” initiative to persuade residents to leave a light on if out during the evening, to create the impression the house is occupied. The police also intend to conduct some evening patrols, partly with the objective of tackling rough sleepers in certain blocks of flats.\nThe meeting discussed an initiative in Wandle Valley Ward called “Streetwatch” involving residents patrolling the streets. There was concern about this proposal. The threat to the future of PCSOs (Police Community Support Officers, the backbone of our neighbourhood policing approach) was also a matter of concern.\nSUTTON SOUTH WARD PANEL MEETING 14 JULY 2015\nA good meeting with a high turnout of panel members and some members of the public. There was a long discussion, prompted by a member of the public, of a burglary in Albion Road, and what the police meant when they say they have “closed” the case. They mean it is still to be pursued if new evidence arises. Police priorities continue to focus on vehicle speed checks and thefts from vehicles. There was praise for the talk given to Sutton South Hello! by Sergeant Coles on scams.\nPANEL MEETING 29 APRIL 2015\nThe second meeting held in public and perhaps slightly disappointing that while there was a much better attendance of members than last time there were no members of the public.\nGood news that there has been a major decline in anti-social behaviour across the Borough. Comparing the figures for crime in the Ward for the first three months of 2015 compared to the same months in the previous year burglaries of houses have fallen from 10 to 8, burglaries of garages are the same at 6, thefts from motor vehicles are down to 5 from 14, and thefts of motor vehicles down to 1 from 3.\nThe police have completed the promises given last time to undertake a bicycle marking scheme, to target thefts from motor vehicles at specific locations and undertake speed checks in specific roads. They agreed to provide a speaker on police matters to a meeting of Sutton South Hello! and undertake speed checks in Langley Park Road.\nSUTTON SOUTH WARD PANEL MEETING 20 JANUARY 2015\nA major success as the panel met in public for the first time. Only 5 members of the public came to this first meeting, attended by Trish and Richard, at Christchurch. But a good start.\nSUTTON SOUTH WARD PANEL MEETING 2 OCTOBER 2014\nThis was not a well attended meeting. We spent part of the time discussing the recent changes to consultation arrangements introduced by the Mayor. They are not popular, and have led to the demise of the popular local Borough-wide consultative group. We discussed how we might meet in public in the future. The crime statistics presented by the police continue to show the Ward has low crime levels, with theft from vehicles one of the most common offences. Agreed priorities are burglary, theft from motor vehicles and anti-social behaviour.\nPANEL MEETING 9 JULY 2014\nThis was the first meeting held since the election so had some different members. It was the first meeting Trish attended, but former Councillor Heather Honour is still on the panel, which we warmly applaud.\nThe higher level committee for the “sector” has now met. It was suggested that there is to be an even higher level committee to be formed. Priorities continue to be burglary, motor vehicle crime and assault, together with action on drugs, anti-social behaviour and traffic/speeding. There are relatively few assaults in our area, some burglaries and some motor vehicle crime. Anti-social behaviour and speeding are seen as priorities by residents.\nCrime figures were discussed a the meeting and some particular incidents. The Ward remains a low crime area but there was concern about some burglaries and cases of ASB. The police were congratulated on the success of a recent drugs operation at Sutton station. There is to be a further change of Sergeant.\nSUTTON SOUTH WARD PANEL MEETING 11 DECEMBER 2013\nThis was the most well attended meeting for a long time.\nIt was somewhat dominated by a discussion of the future of the panel under proposals put forward by the Mayor’s office for Policing (MOPAC) to re-organise arrangements for the community to have a consultative dialogue with the police. Heather and Richard have expressed the view consistently that this is a step backwards and that successful arrangements in Sutton that work well will be disrupted.\nThe Ward panels will no longer set the policing priorities. This is a backward step.\nPolicing priorities for the Ward – no longer set by the local panel – are burglary, motor vehicle crime and violence with injury. This last priority is not relevant to Sutton South, which is a low crime area with few such crimes. The police agreed, at the meeting, to continue action on local priorities such as traffic and speeding.\nThe meeting also heard from John Withersby, who is the Licensing Sergeant for the Borough, who is concerned about drinking and anti-social behaviour in the town centre. If you have a concern about some licensed premises phone him (in confidence) on 020 8649 0796. There was also a discussion of the progress of the Neighbourhood Watch scheme in the Borough.\nThe police listed an impressive series of initiatives in the Ward, including what is described as “super cocooning” following burglaries – giving lots of advice and information to local people.\nSUTTON SOUTH WARD PANEL MEETING 11 SEPTEMBER 2013\nHeather and Richard attended the meeting of the Sutton South Ward Police Panel on 11 September. Members discussed latest crime trends. The panel sets priorities for police action in the Ward and the existing priorities were burglary (in particular theft from garages) and motor vehicle crime (in particular theft from cars). The panel decided to add a third priority, anti-social behaviour (paying particular attention to drug dealing).\nPANEL MEETING 12 JUNE 2013\nHeather and Richard attended the Sutton South Ward police panel on 12 June. There was discussion of current crime trends, including recent burglaries and attempted burglaries in Mayfield Road.\nWhile the police were unable to give a reason for these incidents they commented that sometimes there is a “clustering” of crime in an area for a short period for no obvious reason, but it would be unusual for it to persist as a problem. They have moved quickly to re-assure residents and have knocked on doors in Mayfield Road, and left a feedback form where there was no-one in. If residents have any observations to make to the local police they can contact them on ztsnt-suttonsouth@met.police.uk\nAlso, nine local residents attended their recent street briefing.\nWhile no-one can ever be complacent and we must all maintain our vigilance, it remains the case that this Ward is a low crime area, indeed one of the safest areas in south London. Burglary, along with theft from motor vehicles, remains a police priority for the area, but the most common form of burglary in our area is theft from garages, and residential (house) burglaries are mercifully rare.\nThe meeting also discussed future action on speeding, a dog seizure in Cumnor Road, a cannabis factory in Westmoreland Drive and the success of the extension of the “No Drinking Zone” to our Ward.\nWe also discussed the introduction of the “London Policing Model” on 24 June. While the implications are not all positive, these changes are not going to damage the excellent service we generally get from our local police.\nSUTTON SOUTH WARD PANEL MEETING 6 MARCH 2013\nThe police were again able to report encouraging crime statistics. The figures for the year to December showed a total of 107 crimes compared to 133 for the same period in the previous year.\nBurglaries had, however, increased, from 14 to 18. This reflects a rise in burglaries everywhere in Sutton. Thefts from motor vehicles were down from 17 to 9. Incidents where the police had to intervene in domestic arguments were down from 23 to 10. “Drive out” without paying from the one garage in our Ward were down from 14 to 7.\nIn terms of crime trends, the police were concerned about bin thefts – the large metal bins, stolen for their metal.\nThe meeting also discussed, inte alia, reviving the “Speedwatch” initiative, pizza delivery vehicles continuing to use the Wellesley Road passageway, people riding bikes on pavements and Metropolitan police re-organisation.\nSUTTON SOUTH WARD PANEL MEETING, 5 DECEMBER 2012\nThe most alarming aspect of this meeting was that only 3 panel members, plus the police, turned up – the Reverend Mark Pullinger, Heather and Richard.\nThe figures showed crime down 19% on the figures for the same period in 2011 – burglary down, theft much the same. There were increases in assault and in harrassment (in this context, this being an umbrella term for a variety of forms of anti-social behaviour) but some of this is close to the station and, while in the Ward, not involving our residents.\nAnti-social behaviour in the Ward is, overall, down. Other matters discussed included progress on the fence at the back of Forest Dene, incidents involving dogs, pizza delivery drivers, proposals we made for use of “Community Payback”, the pressure from the “centre” in London for more action on drug enforcement (which is stretching local resources), and the reasons for the decline in anti-social behaviour incidents in the Ward.\nIt was agreed that the priorities would continue to be burglary and motor vehicle crime.\nSOUTH SUTTON WARD PANEL MEETING, 12 SEPTEMBER 2012\nThe meeting was chaired by our Sergeant, Geraldine Costello.\nThe panel congratulated the police on the latest crime figures, showing a 23% drop in crime in the year to date. There were some significant variations between categories, with assaults causing injury and harassment both up. However, there were large falls in non-residential burglaries and criminal damage, which accounted for the overall reduction. The area remains a low crime area with the police confident they are on top of the overall situation.\nThe panel discussed the three Ward priorities – drug use in the Brighton Road, motor vehicle crime and theft from garages. Theft from garages and motor vehicle crime have fallen but it was agreed that we want to keep it that way. It was agreed that drug dealing and use in the Brighton Road would be put into a “normal vigilance” category. Significant action also continued to be taken on theft of metal.\nOther issues discussed included:\n– late-night noise problems at the weekend in Cedar Road\n– the application of a nightclub in Sutton town centre to extend its opening hours from 2am to 3am\n– cutting of a hedge close to the ball court at Sutton Court to increase the visibility of the ball court and its surrounding area\n– fencing at Sutton Court\n– petrol theft from a local garage\n– speeding in Cavendish Road\n– security arrangements concerning certain specific and sensitive locations\n– a cannabis factory in Ferndown Close.\nThe meeting was pleased that the local police had kept things under control when the Olympics had placed a strain on resources, though the Sergeant felt this had been less of a strain than expected. While we were pleased the Olympics were now over and demands on police resources would return to normal, we felt the police had done a superb job during the Olympics.\nSOUTH SUTTON WARD PANEL MEETING, 4 JULY 2012\nThe meeting was chaired by our Sergeant, Geraldine Costello.\nThe panel congratulated the police on the latest crime figures, showing a 29% drop in crime in the year to date. The three Ward priorities were, it was agreed, unchanged as drug use in the Brighton Road, motor vehicle crime and theft from garages. Theft from garages has falllen but it was agreed that we want to keep it that way.\nIt was noted that the police have taken positive action on dog fouling. A particular success, of note, was to to agree an “Acceptable Behaviour Contract” with a dog owner in Cedar Road who accepted that she had let her dog foul the pavement.\nThe meeting also discussed how to get best value from the work of “Community Payback”, finding new members for the panel and a new Chair.\nAn incident of particular concern was a mugging in Mayfield Road, on which a press release had been issued by the police, as below.\n“Police are appealing for the public’s help after a 30-year-old man was attacked from behind and had his Gucci watch stolen. The man was on his way home from a friend’s house at approximately 23.15hrs after watching England lose to Italy on penalties on Sunday 24th June.\nHe had walked from the Manor Park area, past the B & Q store and onwards into Mayfield Road when he was pulled face down on the pavement. His watch was grabbed from his wrist.\nThe two, or possibly three, suspects ran off towards The Ridgway.\nThe watch is a men’s Gucci watch, valued at £695, with a black face with four diamonds encrusted on the face marking the quarter hours, and a silver bracelet. It was a present from the victim’s partner so has sentimental value too.\nAlthough there are no descriptions of the suspects, police are keen to speak to a white male who walked past the victim before the incident. He is described as 28 years of age, 6ft tall, with blond, short spiky hair. He was wearing jeans and blue Lacoste trainers. The victim is a black man.\nDet Con Mark Cooper, of Sutton’s Burglary & Robbery Investigation Team, said police are keen to hear from this passer-by, from any witnesses who saw the incident, or from anyone who may have been offered the watch.\nIf you have any information that could help police with their enquiries, please call Sutton’s Burglary & Robbery Investigation Team on 020 8649 0777. Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.”\nSOUTH SUTTON WARD PANEL MEETING. 18 APRIL 2012\nThe panel welcomed Sergeant Geraldine Costello, our new sergeant, whom we share with Belmont Ward.\nThe latest crime statistics show Sutton South remains a low crime area and crime has, overall, fallen further, but with a small increase in residential burglaries, many from garages. There is a welcome reduction in thefts from motor vehicles and criminal damage.\nThe panel confirmed as police priorities for the next three months:\n– theft from motor vehicles, to keep on top of this following the recent reduction\n– drugs and anti-social behaviour in the Brighton Road\n– garage burglaries\n– support for “Operation Ferrous”, which relates to the theft and trading of scrap metal, a particular problem due to the escalation in the price of scrap metal.\nThe panel discussed “community payback” work by offenders. It also had a discussion of ways of improving how it represents the local community and provides information on its work, to have a better dialogue with the police on behalf of the community.\n14 MARCH 2012 WARD PANEL MEETING: POSTPONED\nWe expressed concern at the cancellation of the Ward panel meeting arranged for 14 March. We wrote to senior police officers in Sutton as below, and received satisfactory assurances in return about future policing resources for the Ward:\n“To Superintendant Phil Willis, Head of SPSS\nTHE WARD PANEL MEETING ON 14 SEPTEMBER 2011\nCrime statistics presented at the September meeting showed Sutton South continued to be a low crime area, though there was concern at the number of thefts from motor vehicles and at a spate of break-ins to garages in the area of the Ward west of the Brighton Road. Police priorities continued to be thefts from motor vehicles and drug dealing. Police would continue to monitor the position on street drinking. Information was given on plans to erect a fence at the rear of the Brighton Road car park and between Sutton Court and Forest Dene. There were plans for a safety leaflet drop warning residents about bogus trades people. Plans were discussed for community involvement in “Speed Watch” to reduce speeding in the area. This is a picture of representatives of the Ward police consultative panel, including Richard, undertaking a “Speedwatch” inititive on the morning of 6 July, in The Ridgway, in our Ward. This activity involves checking the speed of vehicles by using a “speed gun”, which you can see being deployed in the picture, and the police warning those travelling too fast.\n[…] Sutton police Contact details and information for our local police force […]",

Car clubs have a role to play.\nCar clubs form an important element in our local sustainable transport policies. The car club “Streetcar” has proven popular in Sutton since it was launched three years ago. It now has more than 800 members in Sutton and wishes to expand further with new bays and cars.\nClick on this link to find out more about Streetcar.\nWe have supported the installation of an additional car club bay in Albion Road, in Sutton South Ward. This would involve a change of use in respect of a bay that is currently for “pay and display” parking, but which is not occupied for that purpose very often as there are enough other bays in the road. It was proposed that, subject to consultation, this bay would be reserved for a car club car that members of the club can use. The proposal is currently “on hold” due to issues concerned with Streetcar, but we hope it will be returned to in due course.\n[ The bay in Albion Road ]",

While there are many of these green computer boxes on our street corners, a new generation of much larger and more obtrusive boxes is now being installed.\nA post elsewhere on this site deals with a specific problem of the box in Cedar Road.\nWe need these boxes to improve broadband speeds. But Openreach (a subsidiary of BT), who install them, do not need planning permission or to take any notice of the aesthetic and amenity aspects of the erection of the boxes. This is by Act of Parliament and the local Council is helpless.\nWe are collecting information. Is there a box near you ? Is it sensibly sited ? Let us know.\nThis box, in Cedar Road, is badly sited, right outside someone’s front window. A post elsewhere on this site deals with this particular problem.\nYou can see how this is right in front of the house.\nThis one in Cornwall Road (not in our Ward) has been placed in front of the house and right in the attractive hedgerow lovingly cultivated by the residents. It could as easily have been a few feet away round the corner and giving no offence.\nResearch by Councillor Clifton has shown that these are not isolated incidents and across London there is increasing concern at the lack of consultation and the poor decisions involved in siting these boxes. Further afield, there are examples of local campaigns in places as far apart as Brighton (see the Brighton Argus, 26 May) and Dundee (the Dundee Courier, April 14).\nOpenreach have “Permitted Development Rights” and, according to the Council’s Planning Department, “Permitted Development Rights” exist provided that the ground or base area does not exceed 1.5 square metres (with only a height restriction of being no more than 15 metres off the ground – if unattached to a building). This is set out under the Electronic Communications Code (Conditions and Restrictions) Regulations 2003 and Part 24 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(Amendment)(England) Order 2001. The only check by the Council is that there is no impediment such as buried cables and, if not, the Council has no power to stop the development.\nCouncillor Clifton said “Parliament, in granting these powers to bypass planning law, would have expected the company to behave responsibly in considering the impact on local residents.”\nOpenreach have disclosed to Councillor Clifton the full list of criteria used when siting boxes. This is printed below.\nCouncillor Clifton has told them that the criteria are defective in that nothing is said about not erecting boxes immediately outside a resident’s front door or window, and nothing is said about aesthetic considerations or fitting in to the streetscene and local ambience.\nThe criteria are:\n“General Considerations\nThe following points serve as planning considerations when selecting a suitable location for the DSLAM cabinet.\n- The ideal position of the DSLAM cabinet is within 2m of Copper cabinet. Please ensure that there is 1m clearance either side of the DSLAM.\n- The maximum cable length from DSLAM cabinet to PCP is normally 50m (needed to maintain PCP CAL value).\n- The position of, and access to the DSLAM cabinet must accommodate installation by crane from a truck. It must also be feasible to make maintenance visits for an engineer (e.g. to check batteries), or change cards.\n- Situate in a safe and non-obstructive manner for the public, engineers and contractors.\n- Avoid kerbside locations if possible – reducing a traffic hazard.\n- Avoid places where restrictive waiting or working restrictions may apply.\n- Avoid causing obstruction or restricting road and pavement users’ line of sight.\n- Avoid locating where the cabinet can be used as an intermediate stepping-stone to someone wishing to climb over a high wall/fence.\n- Consider how to minimise the risk due to other services (e.g. overhead obstructions).\n- Proximity to schools, elderly, disabled and other vulnerable groups where a lifting operation would incur additional risk. .\n- Consider obstruction to maintenance of gardens and buildings, such as hedge cutting, fence preserving, etc. Please allow 100mm from cabinet to wall.\n- Safe dig prints and the use of Locator 9B can be used to avoid positioning of the cabinet above other services.\n- Health and Safety Guide (47) is a useful document\n- Where proposed DSLAM cabinets are located in flood plain areas, try to mitigate the risk of flooding where possible. The level of risk can be found on the Environment Agency website. Local, County councils and other utilities can be a useful source of info.\n- You need to take account of noise emissions and allow for this in quiet residential premises (aim for greater distances from bedrooms). Avoid locations where noise could reverberate or be directed towards premises (such as alleyways). Discuss individual cases if this cannot be achieved with the policy team. “",

This consultation is called the Sutton Link and seeks views on bringing the tram to Sutton, or developing what is called a new Bus Rapid Transport (BRT) route. You can respond to the consultation at\nhttp://www.tfl.gov.uk/sutton-link\nCouncillor Whitehead, the Chair of Sutton Council’s transport liaison committee, and Sutton Council officers will be meeting with TfL London Buses in the New Year to discuss how bus services can be tailored to meet future development proposals in the borough. It will also provide an opportunity to raise any issues related to any shortcomings with existing services. A similar meeting has been held in previous years but Councillor Whitehead tells us a more thorough review of outer London services is now promised by TfL.\nThis is an opportunity to set out views on any changes we would like to see made to services in the area, including changes to frequencies or the duration of services, or route diversions/extensions to provide missing connections.\nOfficers will consider how this information is presented to TfL. However, the final decision on any such changes rests with TfL and there will be limited resources available.\nLocal residents in Sutton South Ward have raised with us the following concerns when consulted in the recent past.\nRoute frequency – although residents have commented that on some routes, such as route 80, frequency and reliability is good, bus 470 is seen as too infrequent, being only about every half hour.\nSimilarly, route S4 could be more frequent.\nA further difficulty with the 470 is that it does not run on a Sunday so our suggestions for the 470 are to increase the frequency from once every half an hour, run it on Sundays and (see below) extend it to Epsom hospital.\nThe X26 bus to Heathrow is used by many and the increased frequency of the X26 is welcome, but the buses have difficulty in keeping to the timetable, perhaps because of the length of the route. Some residents say they would not use it if travelling to Heathrow to catch a plane as it is not 100% reliable. There may thus be a case for increasing the frequency further.\nRoute length – could the 470 go to Epsom hospital rather than Epsom market as there are residents who use it to go to the hospital?\nOn route 151, the frequency and reliability is generally good but the service could be improved if some rush hour buses turned round at North Cheam, bearing in mind that the 213 duplicates the 151 onwards to Worcester Park.\nTimetabling – it is noted that the 80 and 280 buses running northwards along Brighton Road frequently arrive at the same time. Could the timetabling be looked at?\nPassenger information – it has been pointed out that the two bus stops in Mulgrave Road close to Sutton station do not include digital displays on bus arrival information. Although there are other ways of getting this information, on your mobile phone, not all passengers have the skill to get this.\nA review of the information arrangements was suggested for some routes. On route 164, at some stops the bus is recorded as a minute away or due but it does not turn up for six or seven minutes.\nOther matters – There has often been comment on arrangements at Sutton station. A resident suggested that congestion in Mulgrave Roadcould be alleviated by moving the taxi rank. It would be possible to move it to The Quadrant now the side entrance to the station is open, but this would probably be unpopular with the taxi drivers and railway passengers, and was not a proposal pursued under the Sutton Gateway project. A resident also commented that this part of Mulgrave Road has on occasions been briefly flooded during very heavy downpours. I have asked Council engineers to investigate.\nA summary of these comments, by bus route, is:\n470 – increase the frequency from once every half an hour, run it on Sundays and extend it to Epsom hospital\n151 – the service could be improved if some rush hour buses turned round at North Cheam, bearing in mind that the 213 duplicates the 151 onwards to Worcester Park\n80 and 280 – buses running northwards along Brighton Road frequently arrive at the same time so review the timetabling\n164 – review the information arrangements as at some stops the bus is recorded as a minute away or due but it does not turn up for six or seven minutes\nS1 – review the way the timetable is set out on the website\nS4 – review the frequency.\nIt should be noted that while this summary is focussed on suggesting improvements, many residents have commented to us in favourable terms on the frequency and reliability of local bus services.\nWe have put this digest of views forward to officers for consideration. Any decision rests, of course, with Transport for London.",

The Committee’s membership comprises the Councillors for Cheam, Belmont and Sutton South Wards – three Liberal Democrats and nine Conservatives.\nThis study has a long history but has only been mentioned at meetings of the Local Committee, since we were elected, in a paper presented to the Committee in January, when it was described as a study of parking “in the Belmont station area and roads around/near to the Royal Mardsen Hospital.” It has consequently been handled by Belmont Ward Councillors. However the area to be covered by the consultation in fact extends to the borders of Sutton South Ward.\nMost of Sutton South Ward is already covered by parking controls. Since we joined the local committee we have:\n– supported a consultation with residents at Westmoreland Drive on yellow lining to achieve better access, following a fire and fatality in which access for emergency vehicles may have been an issue\n– supported a number of changes to the designation of parking bays, for example to provide for more parking in Cavendish Road for the residents of and visitors to Fiske Court, a sheltered housing complex.\nThere are nine roads at the east end of the Ward not covered by controls – Mayfield Road, The Ridgway, Chalgrove Road, Farm Road, Upland Road, Downside Road, Kayemoor Road, Willis Avenue and Prior Avenue. If the results of consultation in Belmont Ward lead to new parking controls that could displace parking into our Ward, we will want the Local Committee to consider funding a consultation exercise in the Ward to cover the roads at the east end.",

Given the difficulties with more radical proposals, the traffic engineers proposed building out the kerb on both sides at the intersection with Hillcroome Road. This would ensure that cars crossing from that end would start their journey across the bridge from a more central position. They would be more visible, earlier, to cars coming from the other end and to pedestrians on the bridge. The road has for some time been marked out to show where the kerb would be built out to.\nIn addition, warning signs alerting drivers to the road narrowing and the presence of pedestrians will be upgraded and repositioned to make them more prominent.\nReaction to the proposal has been generally positive but there is also support for limiting the build out to the left hand side of the road, as you face Kings Lane from Hillcroome Road. A safety study was commissioned and suggested that either option would improve the safety of the bridge.\nWe have decided to proceed with the reduced scheme, building out on just the left hand side. The improvement will be funded by Transport for London as a small, low-cost but helpful safety measure.",
  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_category_news_page_11/content_453.html": "A green, pleasant, suburban environment – this is Sutton South\nThe first full Council meeting of the new administration, following the local elections, was held on 10 September. It was held at Overton Grange school, in Sutton South Ward, the first time the Council has met in our Ward, This follows a decision by Council to get out and about round the Borough, to see the Borough and be seen, rather than sit in the Council offices.\nThe main debate was on the subject of single use plastics, on which Trish made an impassioned speech drawing attention to the plight of the oceans anc calling for greater responsibility worldwide. Richard took the opportunity of a debate on the Council’s plan to welcome Councillors to Sutton South. He said:\n“We are now doing something we perhaps should have done before and getting out round the Borough, to see different parts of the Borough and be seen there. And tonight we are starting that process by meeting in Sutton South Ward. So I think it appropriate for me as a Councillor for Sutton South to welcome you all to Sutton South. I know my fellow Sutton South Councillor Councillor Fivey wants to join me in extending this welcome, to Sutton South which is famous for:\nA low level of crime, one of the lowest for any Ward in the 32 London Boroughs\nExcellent schools, our local schools are brilliant\nA unique environmental facility in the Devonshire Avenue Nature Area\nA green, pleasant, suburban environment\nAnd a relatively high level of employment, contributed to by our success in persuading a major transnational company in the oil exploration business – Subsea 7 – to locate their global, international headquarters in the Ward, bringing 900 jobs, some – not just in more routine occupations – now being occupied by local people, with 900 staff spending money in local shops and restaurants, and boosting the local economy.\nI relate this to the important entry in the plan on page 17 reading\n“Implementation of the Local Plan to deliver retail, office and industrial development and employment opportunities”\nWe have done that in Sutton South – we will continue to do it.”",

We want residents to report to us instances of graffiti, which is one of the scourges of our times, worldwide. In general, the Council has a good record in cleaning off graffiti quickly. A difficulty is when the graffiti is on private property and the owners of the property have responsibility.\nHere is an example of graffiti we got cleaned off, on the bridge at Kings Lane.\nIn support of our policies to combat global warming and reduce carbon emissions, the programme to fit electric vehicle charging points in lampposts in our Ward continues. A further consultation exercise is about to take place on the installation of two new electric vehicle charging points in Mulgrave Road, close to the junction with Worcester Road. A preliminary consultation found majority support but few residents responded.\nThere are now charging points at the following locations:\nOpposite 49 The Ridgway\nOpposite 26 Langley Park Road\nOpposite Foxley Court in Christchurch Park\nOpposite 10 Cumnor Road\nIn Cedar Gardens\nOpposite Grange Court, Grange Road\nOpposite Thomas House, Grange Road\nOpposite 13 Stanley Road\nOpposite Fairford Court, Stanley Road\nWe want to draw attention to the Sutton Citizen space survey where residents should log their suggestions for EV charge points.\nThe photo shows the first vehicle that used the first charging point in the Ward, in The Ridgway. Given the policy to ultimately phase out petrol driven vehicles, a big and continuing expansion will be needed.\nSutton Council is working with Siemens to install Ubitricity lamp column electric vehicle charging points. Ubitricity lamp column charging points are compact and fit into the door of a lamp column. The aim of lamp column charging is to give residents the ability to easily charge electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles on the street where they live, especially if they do not have off-street parking or are unable to install their own home charging point. Installing residential charging points is important because a key barrier to people switching to electric vehicles is the concern around where they will be able to charge their vehicle.\nNot all lamp columns are suitable for lamp column charging points. The lamp columns need to be “electrically suitable”, be positioned near the kerb and have enough internal space to fit the charging point. They need to be sensibly located so that a vehicle could safely park and charge next to the lamp column. The lamp columns also need to be made of metal, not concrete.\nAn “earth mat”, a small metal grid, is also installed in the footway next to the lamp column. This is to make the charging point “electrically safe” if there is a fault. There are signs to indicate that the lamp column has a charging point fitted, though this sign will not prevent non-electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles from parking next to the lamp column.\nThis is a major advance in our drive to promote electric vehicles and combat global warming.\nSutton Council has declared that there is a climate emergency and at the Council meeting on 16 January we adopted a progress report entitled “Environment Strategy and Climate Emergency: Progress Report and Update.” In his speech on this important report Richard pointed out that far from being some vague affirmation of worthy sentiments the report was packed full of detailed, positive actions we had taken and could be proud of. He listed some of them\n– ten new school streets\n– 120 dockless ebikes (although we came quite late to the concept of ebike schemes compared to many London boroughs)\n– double the number of new trees planted than our target\n– seven parks received the green flag award for their biodiversity management with butterfly banks in the parks\n– almost 7 000 teaching sessions on biodiversity, mostly to school age children\n– the work of the Sutton Nature Conservation Volunteers, the Community Environment Champions Network, the Green Enterprise partnership\n– the Healthy Homes Advice and Support Service, providing assessment of homes for energy efficiency\n– promoting green spaces, energy efficiency and electric vehicles through our planning policies and decisions\n– LED street lighting and electric vehicle charging points in street lamps\n– promoting re-cycling of waste\n– the promotion of initiatives to support locations where items can be repaired and re-used\n– action to deal with extreme weather events\n– promoting the cycling network and cycle maintenance and safety workshops\n– travel plans for our own staff to promote cycling and walking, and switching our own vehicles to electric.\nThe list goes on and on.\nThis is an important programme based on positive, practical steps we are taking to protect the environment.\nWe have a manifesto commitment to plant more trees, to improve air quality, combat global warming and promote the green, suburban feel of Sutton. We will be planting new trees in the next few months in Downside Road, Upland Road, Willis Avenue and Prior Avenue.\nWe were delighted when, in accordance with the commitment to plant more trees to combat global warming, two new trees were planted in early 2021 in The Ridgway. The story concerning the tree outside number 23 is interesting. Many years ago there was a tree pit here and a tree. The tree died. Contractors tarmaced over the tree pit. The tarmac would periodically sag. Richard suggested restoring the tree pit and planting a tree. This was done. The photo was taken during the brief fall of snow on 24 January 2021.\nTransport for London (TfL) have been consulting on changes to local bus routes, including the S1, S3, S4, 80 and 407, and have now reached decisions.\nTheir original proposals and the report on the outcome of consultation can be found on the Transport for London’s website: tfl.gov.uk/sutton-croydon-bus-changes\nThe outcome means that there is little change to the situation in our Ward.\nThe main outcome is that changes to the S3 bus that might have affected our area have not been pursued, which means the S3 will still serve Cedar Road and Langley Park Road. Changes to the S4 route that affected our area are not implemented and it will still run to Overton Grange school and along Grange Road. We are pleased with this outcome, which means there will not be any detriment to services in our Ward, and points we put into the letter of representation sent by Sutton Council have been acted on.\nStudents returning to school at the start of the 2020 autumn term at Overton Grange enjoyed a quieter and safer atmosphere due to the introduction of a “school street” at the gates in Stanley Road at the time students arrived and left for the school day. This involved the closure of the part of Stanley Road adjacent to the school for a short period in the morning and afternoon, when the school day starts and ends.\nThe objectives of school streets are:\n1) To improve safety around the school at start and finish time\n2) To improve air quality for children outside their school gates (small people are particularly vulnerable to emissions from cars)\n3) To create a more welcoming atmosphere around the school, where children can walk in the road and parents can feel more relaxed.\nThe scheme was a six month trial funded by Transport for London, who set the parameters of the scheme. The scheme was withdrawn in advance of the conclusion of the six month trial following a legal challenge to the lawfulness of such schemes, but by then it was proposed to withdraw the scheme. This related to difficulties experienced in enforcing the traffic controls, which at successful “school street” schemes involved the participation of the school and parents.\nWhen Richard was first elected in 2010 one of the first projects he initiated was to get the “No Drinking Zone” in the centre of Sutton extended to our Ward. There were a group of what the police termed “all day drinkers” who used to congregate on Cedar Road outside Forest Dene Court.\nThe zone was extended to cover the area of our Ward south of the station as far as Cavendish Road, and running west to east from Brighton Road to Langley Park Road. In this area it is unlawful to continue to drink alcohol if asked by the police to stop, and there are provisions that would enable the police to confiscate alcohol. You will find reminders of the provisions attached to lampposts in the area, for example in Cedar Road.\nThe Council has, by law, to re-consider and consult afresh on these provisions from time to time. It is doing so at present. You can comment or make representations on the proposal to maintain these provisions. Representations must be made in writing and addressed to Safer Sutton Partnership Service, Environment, Housing and Regeneration Directorate, Sutton Police Station, 6 Carshalton Road, Sutton, SM1 4RF, before 21st September 2020. You need to state the grounds on which your representation or objection is made.\nIf you have any questions about this consultation, you can contact the Safer Sutton Partnership Team via email at safersutton@sutton.gov.uk.\nThe renowned artist Lionel Stanhope has brightened up our Ward. The painting, on the railway bridge at Sutton station, is not easy to photograph, so what is shown below is a CGI of the artwork created before the painting was undertaken. What is above, is the painting.\nThe railway bridge at Sutton station has been brightened up with a painting by the renowned artist Lionel Stanhope, whose art has brightened up many railway stations. Stanhope completed the painting in four days starting on 26 May. Stanhope is regarded by many as a better and more important street artist than Banksy. We have been pleased to support this project which brings an attractive feature to add interest to the area.The façade of the railway bridge, as you come out of Sutton station and turn left,was a patchwork of various colours. The Council first tried to interest Network Rail in making the bridge look more attractive, over four years ago, during the “Sutton Gateway” project, which involved re-paving the area around the station and the installation of the clock opposite Sutton station. The artwork has been mainly funded by Network Rail, with a small contribution from Sutton Council. The parapet of the bridge required extensive cleaning and preparation before the painting commenced. Lionel Stanhope produced a design which incorporates the word “Sutton” in the typeface traditionally used by Southern railway, and a depiction of the historic Sutton locomotive. The locomotive “Sutton” came into the possession of the Council many years ago and is a 144 year old, 28 tonne, 26 feet, A1 class Terrier steam engine. It is currently with a heritage railway undertaking in Tunbridge Wells who have undertaken to restore it. The painting is an addition to an area becoming famous for its street art. Within two hundred yards you can find the remarkable statue “The Messenger”, located directly outside the entrance to Quadrant House in The Quadrant. The Messenger is a statue, a sculpture in bronze with very dark patination, completed by David Wynne in 1981, of a large horse and rider. It was a major commission for the sculptor, who died in 2014. It took four years to complete from his first idea and inspiration, on receipt of the brief – through roughing out, refining and casting in a foundry, to the final unveiling and installation. We are not including a photograph of the statue in this post due to the philistine attitude of the owners of Quadrant House, who do not cherish this artwork and have stuck a notice on the front of it about some aspect of building maintenance, thus disfiguring it. They have been unco-operative in the face of requests to remove the notice. Even more striking is the remarkable mural by the famous Spanish “street” artist from Bilbao, Eva Mena, on a wall in nearby Wellesley Road. This is said to be of the American singer and musician Erykah Badu. The work was commissioned by the owners of the building, Indepth Hygiene Services. It was painted in three days in 2010, when the artist came over from Spain to paint it. It is entirely typical of her street art, which is to be found on walls in many parts of the world, including Egypt, Ireland and Spain, as well as Sutton. Eva Mena is said to be more famous than Banky in her native Spain.\nThe Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, advised by Historic England, has added to the National Heritage List for England the historic sewer pipe in Hillcroome Road.\nThis structure thus becomes the only structure in our Ward to be nationally listed as of historic and architectural significance, so it could only be altered or have work done on it if listed building consent was obtained. There are three other buildings in our Ward that are listed on the Local List of structures of local importance, which provides a lesser degree of protection. These are:\nthe Registrar’s office (The Russetings) in Worcester Road, a Victorian house that it is believed the Walls family, famous for Walls ice cream and Walls sausages, lived in, though this is disputed\nStowford in Brighton Road, a Victorian house, now the Eagle House school\nthe pavilion of the Highfield Lawns tennis club at the junction of Mayfield Road and The Ridgway, as an example of an Edwardian tennis pavilion, build by local builder Percy Vere Windebank in 1908\nThese Drain Pressure Release Pipes, also known as ‘Stink Pipes’, can be seen at various locations within the old Carshalton Urban District Council boundary. They have been listed on the basis of the criterion that they are important to the townscape view.\nThey were produced by W. Macfarlane & Co. of Glasgow, a prestigous Victorian Ironworks. The company employed imaginative designers and produced huge amounts of ornate and decorative ironwork. The pipes are extremely tall with an ornate top fixture comprising a large arrow, a globe with four trumpetlike funnels and a spike spire piercing a crown. The height and funnels may be to ensure the gas disperses efficiently so as not to inconvenience local residents. It is not known what purpose the arrow has, whether to indicate the direction of sewer flow or act as a weather vane to indicate wind direction.\nThey serve two purposes, firstly to prevent a build up of pressure in underground sewers in the event of a blockage, and secondly to vent off any hydrogen sulphide gas. This gas, which smells of rotten eggs, can build up when sewage becomes septic, on long runs, or when the speed of the sewage is slow in flat areas. It is extremely corrosive and can eat through the concrete pipes. The sewerage system would have become a necessity after the rapid increases in population and residences in Sutton and Carshalton at the end of the 1800s. Prior to this sewage would have been dispersed into cesspits and drainage ditches, with a risk of contamination of the drinking water supply, contributing to ill health.\nThe history of W. Macfarlane and Co. and their foundry, the Saracen Foundry, is fascinating. In 1851 Walter Macfarlane (1817-1885) established his company in a disused foundry in Saracen Lane in Gallowgate, Glasgow, and named it Saracen Foundry. It later moved to Washington Street, near the River Clyde. By 1872 his nephew, also named Walter MacFarlane (1853–1932), joined the rapidly expanding company and they relocated to Possilpark, a site of 100 acres on the outskirts of the city. Here a foundry with railway access and a village-styled infrastructure to house the workforce was built. In a decade it housed 10,000 people but the vast iron-founding site caused much pollution. The young MacFarlane made standardisation and good design the key to the company’s successful development. The foundry’s work was used on prestigous developments and widely distributed. During the Second World War Possilpark industrial works was a vast and well-lit target for attack. The recovery of iron to melt down for the war effort also removed much of Saracen’s work. After the war, the collapse of the British Empire, the move away from steam power and the use of new designs and materials led to a vast decline in orders. In 1967 the foundry at Possilpark closed.\nOne of the ways to combat global warming is to plant more trees. Richard and Trish have been responsible for getting the Council to plant many trees in our Ward, some to replace trees that were lost to disease but many new trees. Trees absorb carbon dioxide and pollution, and pump out oxygen. Sutton is amongst the leaders among the 32 London boroughs in the number of street trees per yard of pavement. This contributes to the pleasant, green, suburban atmosphere of the area we all so much enjoy, though it creates a headache every autumn when the leaves fall.\nThis planting activity has included trees in:\nUpland Road – outside 18, 20, 39. 103\nCamborne Road – outside 47/49, 32/34\nEffingham Close – 17, 26\nLangley Park Road – opposite 91 Egmont\nDevonshire Road – outside the school\nThe Ridgway – 18, 59\nChristchurch Park – one outside, and one opposite, White Lodge Close.",

We believe this is often from people walking along Cedar Road to get home from nightclubs in Sutton town centre, often in the early morning. We have resisted efforts to open more clubs and extend their hours of operation to yet later in the early hours of the morning (see our post below “Late Night Noise Danger Averted”).\nWe raised the matter at a recent meeting with the police. The police say that their planned use of resources are mainly influenced by the priorities set in the ward (currently non-residential burglaries and vehicle crime) and what crime or anti-social behaviour is reported. They pointed out that they had received few reports from residents of noise problems.\nWe suspect residents are not reporting these incidents to the police at the time as they believe the police can do nothing immediately, or that it is not a serious enough issue with which to bother them. However it is still worth reporting these incidents to the police – using 101 not 999 – as it gives the police a better picture of behaviour in our Ward and they can target their resources accordingly.\nWe have written to residents in Cedar Road with this advice. If you want to discuss any aspect of local policing with a police officer you can contact our excellent Safer Neighbourhoods Team on 020 8721 2497, but let us know your views.",

Please see the press release below.”\nCllr Heather Honour\nSt George’s decide not to proceed with merger process\nSt George’s Healthcare NHS Trust have informed us and our strategic authority, NHS London, that they cannot proceed with their bid to merge with St Helier and Sutton hospitals.\nThroughout the process St George’s have been very positive about the strategic opportunity to merge and the benefits this could bring to patients.\nHowever, due to the financial challenges facing hospitals in south west London and the inability to pre-empt the outcome of the Better Services Better Value review, which is looking at how NHS services are provided across south west London, they do not feel able to proceed at this time.\nThis is because the review, which will be open to public consultation, could have a significant impact on the financial income of all hospitals involved.\nSt George’s have however expressed a full commitment to working closely with St Helier and Sutton hospitals in the future.\nJan Sawkins is the Independent Chair of the special Board set up to help St Helier, Sutton and Epsom hospitals to achieve foundation trust status. She said: “Whilst we have always been aware that a bidder could withdraw during the process, at this stage in the transaction it is obviously very disappointing news.\n“The Transaction Board has a meeting scheduled next week (7 February 2012) and we will use this to consider the options and agree a way forward. This may include re-opening tenders for St Helier and Sutton hospitals.”\nMatthew Hopkins, Trust Chief Executive said: “This is disappointing news, but St George’s have been clear to us that their decision is not based on our staff, nor the quality of the services we provide at St Helier and Sutton hospitals.\n“As you would expect, the Trust Board and those working on the transaction have been looking at other options in case this happened and we look forward to discussing these with the Transaction Board next week.\n“Whilst we are making decisions about the long-term future of our hospitals, our priority will – as ever – continue to be ensuring our patients and local people receive the very best services.”\nAsked what this means for Epsom Hospital, Jan added: “It is the current belief that, subject to Ashford and St Peter’s Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust being confirmed as the Preferred Partner for Epsom Hospital, the de-merger could continue whilst we make alternative arrangements for St Helier and Sutton.\n“Whilst this would, of course, need further investigation and approval by the Transaction Board, the Trust Board and others, it is felt that this would be in the best interest of Epsom Hospital, its patients, staff and local people.\n“However, I would emphasise that the priority remains to secure the future of Epsom, St Helier and Sutton hospitals.”\nFor more information about the work of the Trust visit our website: www.epsom-sthelier.nhs.uk. You can also follow us on Twitter (twitter.com/epsom_sthelier) or find us on Facebook (facebook.com/epsomsthelier).\nThis is what St Georges said in their press release:\nSt George’s media statement\nSt George’s Healthcare NHS Trust submitted a bid for a potential merger with St Helier Hospital in November 2011.\nThe board is clear that a merger between St George’s Healthcare and St Helier would be an excellent strategic opportunity, with the potential to bring significant improvements to the care of patients across southwest London and beyond.\nAfter careful consideration the board has reached the conclusion that the current terms of the merger prevent us from proceeding further at this time.\nThe level of financial challenge facing hospitals in south west London, combined with the inability to pre-empt the outcome of a public consultation around the Better Services Better Value (BSBV) review, means this is not the right time for us to progress with the transaction.\nWe want to continue to build on the existing links that are in place for clinical services. We have identified a number of the potential benefits to patients that would occur from an acquisition which could also be delivered if the organisations remained separate legal entities which we shall continue to pursue.\nWe are particularly keen to develop the clinical and academic networks that span St George’s Healthcare and St Helier, and explore opportunities to establish new networks across services, to the benefit of patients.\nA key priority for the trust is to achieve Foundation Trust (FT) status by 2014, and we will focus our efforts on achieving this. The board feels strongly that achieving FT status will strengthen the opportunities for St. George’s Healthcare and St Helier to work together in the future.\nThis is what Ashford and St Peters have had to say:\nStatement re Epsom Hospital\nChief Executive at Ashford and St Peter’s Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Andrew Liles, said:\n“The decision made by St George’s Healthcare NHS Trust not to pursue their bid for St Helier and Sutton hospitals has not changed our position regarding Epsom and we will continue to progress our plans to acquire Epsom hospital (through merger) in line with the process set out by the Transaction Board. Of course this is still subject to approval by the Transaction Board, Epsom and St Helier, the local health authorities and others and by our own Board, who will need to be assured that any final decision is in the best interests of both the Epsom and Ashford and St Peter’s catchment populations.\nAs a Foundation Trust already we feel we are in a strong position strategically to pursue these plans and we know they have already passed through the first stage of the process successfully, meeting the criteria set by local people, stakeholders and staff. These include new and innovative partnerships – with The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, Central Surrey Health and Surrey and Sussex Partnership NHS Trust – to create an integrated healthcare campus at Epsom Hospital, bringing additional services and added benefits to local patients and staff. Our plans are also made more straightforward by the fact that Epsom hospital is not part of the Better Services Better Value review in South West London.\nWe have also had positive initial discussions regarding financial and commissioning support for our plans, although of course final decisions regarding the preferred provider and agreement of financial support are still to be made.”\nFor more information please call the Press Office on: 01932 722163",

However, I accept that there is no further right of appeal. I particularly object to the fact that the developer, having obtained planning permission, then built something that was different, and the Planning Inspectorate have in effect said it is OK to do that. This is not a god result for local democracy.”\nThe history of this site, 39A Eaton Road, is that Sutton Council rejected a succession of proposals for the demolition of the detached house that used to stand on the site and the construction of a block of flats of a design it did not like, but the developer has a right of appeal to the Planning Inspectorate and the Inspectorate has overturned its decision.\nAn application for planning permission was first made some years ago and rejected by Sutton Council, but allowed by the Planning Inspectorate on appeal. Following a change of ownership of the property permission was sought for a block of a different design, and this was again rejected by the Council. The developer then demolished the house and built something different from either design.

  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_category_news_page_7/content_130.html": "Every year, in the autumn, residents contact us to enquire about the leaf clearing programme. Each year the Council has a leaf clearing programme in place, where a team is deployed to all roads/streets that suffer from significant leaf fall. No Council can keep every road entirely free of leaves during the autumn leaf fall period, as resources are not unlimited. However, there is a programme that will, over a period, gradually clear away the fallen leaves.\nAs part of the South London Waste Partnership contract with Veolia, dedicated resources are provided for leafing, in support of the core street cleaning service. The operation is in two parts.\nFirst, throughout the borough leaves should be cleared by beat sweepers as they break down and start to lose their shape and structure. Gully grates should also be kept clear, by beat sweepers, to help minimise surface water runoff and drainage. Second, the dedicated Veolia team will work to clear leaves throughout the borough, aiming to ensure they do not become hazardous to road users and pedestrians, turning into detritus and blocking road-side gullies with danger of flooding. If there are particular streets that residents feel need to be addressed more urgently, we ask that this is done through the Report It function on the Council website.\nCommencement of the dedicated resource is a joint decision with Veolia and is based on the level of leaf fall and forecast weather conditions. The leaf fall programme is likely to start in the first week of November. There is an operational document that schedules which roads will be visited by the dedicated leafing team and when. As with all operational documents, and particularly with leafing, those involved have to be prepared to respond to weather conditions, to locations where demand and need is greatest, taking decisions on the basis of available resources. This means that the schedule is being constantly reviewed.\nIf residents or a community/resident group would like to get involved in clearing leaves from streets or communal areas please contact Council officers. Simply complete our Community Clean-Up Event Form with a few details. We can provide bags for use and will arrange for them to be collected from a pre-arranged location.\nLeaves from residents own property can be disposed through our paid for Garden Waste service or taken free of charge to the reuse and recycling centre at Kimpton Park Way, Sutton SM3 9QH. Alternatively, a garden composting bin could be used.\nResidents should not sweep leaves from their own property into the road.\nStudents returning to school at the start of the 2020 autumn term at Overton Grange enjoyed a quieter and safer atmosphere due to the introduction of a “school street” at the gates in Stanley Road at the time students arrived and left for the school day. This involved the closure of the part of Stanley Road adjacent to the school for a short period in the morning and afternoon, when the school day starts and ends.\nThe objectives of school streets are:\n1) To improve safety around the school at start and finish time\n2) To improve air quality for children outside their school gates (small people are particularly vulnerable to emissions from cars)\n3) To create a more welcoming atmosphere around the school, where children can walk in the road and parents can feel more relaxed.\nThe scheme was a six month trial funded by Transport for London, who set the parameters of the scheme. The scheme was withdrawn in advance of the conclusion of the six month trial following a legal challenge to the lawfulness of such schemes, but by then it was proposed to withdraw the scheme. This related to difficulties experienced in enforcing the traffic controls, which at successful “school street” schemes involved the participation of the school and parents.\nWhen Richard was first elected in 2010 one of the first projects he initiated was to get the “No Drinking Zone” in the centre of Sutton extended to our Ward. There were a group of what the police termed “all day drinkers” who used to congregate on Cedar Road outside Forest Dene Court.\nThe zone was extended to cover the area of our Ward south of the station as far as Cavendish Road, and running west to east from Brighton Road to Langley Park Road. In this area it is unlawful to continue to drink alcohol if asked by the police to stop, and there are provisions that would enable the police to confiscate alcohol. You will find reminders of the provisions attached to lampposts in the area, for example in Cedar Road.\nThe Council has, by law, to re-consider and consult afresh on these provisions from time to time. It is doing so at present. You can comment or make representations on the proposal to maintain these provisions. Representations must be made in writing and addressed to Safer Sutton Partnership Service, Environment, Housing and Regeneration Directorate, Sutton Police Station, 6 Carshalton Road, Sutton, SM1 4RF, before 21st September 2020. You need to state the grounds on which your representation or objection is made.\nIf you have any questions about this consultation, you can contact the Safer Sutton Partnership Team via email at safersutton@sutton.gov.uk.\nThe reduction in traffic in our residential roads at the height of the lockdown brought quiet, clean air, blue skies and a wish to preserve the pleasant environment it created. We have obtained, from schemes established by the Government and the London Mayor to deal with the aftermath of the pandemic, funding for plans to maintain these advances. The schemes are trials and will be monitored throughout the initial six months. Normally the Council would consult extensively before their introduction but the offer of funding is for immediate action following emergence from lockdown, so the measures will be introduced and monitored to assess resident reaction and their impact. The principal proposals include, in our Ward:\n* The Permit Parking Area (PPA) planned for roads from Mayfield Road running east as far as Banstead Road South, which residents strongly supported in consultation exercises, will be introduced from 30 November. This should reduce traffic and parking in this area\n* An extension of the 20 mph speed limit area in Langley Park Road to roads to the east, as far as Banstead Road South, has been introduced. This includes the part of the Ward where a PPA is to be introduced, so the reduced parking will lead to speeding, which has to be dealt with to maintain the peace and quiet of these residential roads\n* An experimental “modal filter” (allowing cyclists and pedestrians to cross but not other vehicles) to reduce traffic rat running north to south through the area, at Kings Lane, has been introduced. This will be subject to assessment after introduction and maintained if there is resident support. The impact on traffic in Langley Park Road and other local roads will be monitored. A proposal for a second filter, in Langley Park Road, remains in the programme but will not be implemented while Sutton Court Road is closed at the west end, and will be subject to review in the light of an assessment of the impact on traffic in the area from the Kings Lane filter\n* A“school street” at Overton Grange school to deal with traffic at the school gates has been implemented, closing the road where the school is situated to traffic when school students are arriving and leaving, so they can do so in safety and quiet. This involves the closure of Stanley Road south of the junction with Camborne Road when Overton Grange students are arriving and leaving.\nThese improvements will help maintain the peace of the quiet residential roads in our Ward, improve air quality, make the area more pleasant for walking and cycling, and benefit the neighbourhood. We hope to create a neighbourhood with less noise, less non-residential traffic, less speeding, cleaner air and a safer and more pleasant environment, promoting walking and cycling.\nThe proposals also respond to the many of the concerns raised by residents in the survey last year supporting the Council’s Liveable Neighbourhoods bid to the Mayor of London. These were:\n1. Too much rat-running traffic 2. A wish for more trees, plants, greenery 3. A need for improvement to air-quality 4. A need for slower vehicle speeds on residential roads 5. More pedestrian crossings on main roads 6. More welcoming streets for walking 7. More welcoming streets for cycling\nWe will be monitoring closely the impact of these measures and traffic levels were monitored in local streets in August. Normally the Council would consult extensively before their introduction but the offer of funding is for immediate action following emergence from lockdown, so the measures will be introduced and monitored to assess resident reaction and their impact. If, after the initial experimental six month period, the Council was minded to retain the schemes on a permanent basis there would be full resident consultation on a traffic management order.\nOn the criteria for evaluation of the temporary schemes, this is what TfL are asking us to use.\nWe will look at a range of factors when considering whether or not to make a temporary scheme permanent. These include the:\nEffects the scheme has had and could continue to have on road safety and pedestrian overcrowding\nNumber of cyclists and pedestrians who have used each scheme\nContribution each scheme makes to the look and feel of the local area\nImpact of the scheme on traffic, including the bus network\nFeedback from the public and other stakeholders\nImpact of the scheme on people protected under the Equality Act 2010\nBy way of background, the Low Traffic Neighbourhoods scheme was set up by the Conservative Government in consultation with the Labour London Mayor. A total of 859 schemes are being trialled across London for six months from September, and the rules for these schemes were set up by Central Government at very short notice. The Government asked for bids from every London Borough in mid May that had to be made within just a month, by 22nd June, which is not ideal.\nThe choice of areas was based on past requests to Local Committees, suggestions made by residents, and proposals previously made under the Transport for London (TfL) Liveable Neighbourhoods bid.\nThe Department for Transport advise that the six months long trials of the temporary schemes will enable further consultation if it is intended to make any of the schemes permanent. The benefit of a trial is that one can see if a scheme works or does not work, or can be improved. Where these schemes have been set up elsewhere in London they have often proved popular with residents.\nIn normal non- Covid times, we would have expected longer notice of bidding for schemes to allow for public consultation but the Government did not allow the usual process (which normally takes some months), on this occasion, as the timescale was telescoped into a very short one, of one month only.\nOn 20 June Trish and Richard attended an event at the open space opposite St Helier hospital to support the Black Lives Matter movement.\nIt was difficult to estimate the size of the crowd as it was spread out over a vast area to ensure social distancing. The police attended to ensure social distancing was observed, which it was. Trish made an excellent and impassioned speech, as did her daughter Lauren. Lauren told us that the previous day she had submitted, as part of her University course, a dissertation on mental illness in prisons. A finding had been that BAME prisoners were much more likely to be affected. Councillor Dombey also spoke.\nThe renowned artist Lionel Stanhope has brightened up our Ward. The painting, on the railway bridge at Sutton station, is not easy to photograph, so what is shown below is a CGI of the artwork created before the painting was undertaken. What is above, is the painting.\nThe railway bridge at Sutton station has been brightened up with a painting by the renowned artist Lionel Stanhope, whose art has brightened up many railway stations. Stanhope completed the painting in four days starting on 26 May. Stanhope is regarded by many as a better and more important street artist than Banksy. We have been pleased to support this project which brings an attractive feature to add interest to the area.The façade of the railway bridge, as you come out of Sutton station and turn left,was a patchwork of various colours. The Council first tried to interest Network Rail in making the bridge look more attractive, over four years ago, during the “Sutton Gateway” project, which involved re-paving the area around the station and the installation of the clock opposite Sutton station. The artwork has been mainly funded by Network Rail, with a small contribution from Sutton Council. The parapet of the bridge required extensive cleaning and preparation before the painting commenced. Lionel Stanhope produced a design which incorporates the word “Sutton” in the typeface traditionally used by Southern railway, and a depiction of the historic Sutton locomotive. The locomotive “Sutton” came into the possession of the Council many years ago and is a 144 year old, 28 tonne, 26 feet, A1 class Terrier steam engine. It is currently with a heritage railway undertaking in Tunbridge Wells who have undertaken to restore it. The painting is an addition to an area becoming famous for its street art. Within two hundred yards you can find the remarkable statue “The Messenger”, located directly outside the entrance to Quadrant House in The Quadrant. The Messenger is a statue, a sculpture in bronze with very dark patination, completed by David Wynne in 1981, of a large horse and rider. It was a major commission for the sculptor, who died in 2014. It took four years to complete from his first idea and inspiration, on receipt of the brief – through roughing out, refining and casting in a foundry, to the final unveiling and installation. We are not including a photograph of the statue in this post due to the philistine attitude of the owners of Quadrant House, who do not cherish this artwork and have stuck a notice on the front of it about some aspect of building maintenance, thus disfiguring it. They have been unco-operative in the face of requests to remove the notice. Even more striking is the remarkable mural by the famous Spanish “street” artist from Bilbao, Eva Mena, on a wall in nearby Wellesley Road. This is said to be of the American singer and musician Erykah Badu. The work was commissioned by the owners of the building, Indepth Hygiene Services. It was painted in three days in 2010, when the artist came over from Spain to paint it. It is entirely typical of her street art, which is to be found on walls in many parts of the world, including Egypt, Ireland and Spain, as well as Sutton. Eva Mena is said to be more famous than Banky in her native Spain.\nThe Local Government Boundary Commission for England has been reviewing the boundaries of the local Government Wards in Sutton prior to the next local elections in 2022.\nThey published draft proposals last year and have now published final decisions. You can view these on their website.\nTheir final decisions leave the Ward much as it was, with the addition of a part of Mulgrave Road. The new structure they outline will be the structure of Wards at the next Council elections in 2022. The new Ward will be one of the largest Wards in the borough.\nCurrently the Ward runs from Sutton station in the north to Devonshire Road in the south, and Banstead Road South in the east to Overton Road in the west. It is mostly a Ward of residential roads with three schools (Devonshire Avenue primary, Overton Grange, Eagle House school), one small park (the Devonshire Avenue Nature Area), three places of worship (Christchurch, the Friends’ Meeting House, the synagogue in Cedar Road), split into three parts by Langley Park Road and Brighton Road running north-south.\nThe draft proposals published earlier this year removed from the Ward roads east of Upland Road – Kaymoor, Willis, Prior, Downside, Farm Close – and put them into Carshalton Beeches Ward. There were minor adjustments at the western end so the whole Ward moved westwards.\nIn drawing up new boundaries, the Commission is required to aim to deliver electoral equality for voters in Council elections so that each Councillor represents roughly the same number of voters. The review also aimed to ensure that the new Council wards reflect, as far as possible, the interests and identities of communities across Sutton.\nThe final proposals leave the Ward much as it was, with the addition of a small part of Mulgrave Road. The new Ward will be one of the largest Wards in the borough.\nAfter a debate on 14 October Sutton Council submitted some proposals. Richard spoke in this debate, commenting in particular on the proposals fro Sutton South Ward. He said:\n“I recognise that there is always a tension between drawing lines on maps that create sensible geographical structures in terms of communities and natural boundaries and getting the numbers right in terms of residents per Councillor. I would like to stress that where these create tensions I think it important to give priority to getting the boundaries right, creating areas that residents recognise as communities, in particular respecting natural boundaries such as main roads and railway lines, and keeping recognised communities together, and this should be the priority even if it does lead to some unevenness in Ward sizes. In any exercise like this there will inevitably be some disparity in the size of Wards with some outliers.”\nThe Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, advised by Historic England, has added to the National Heritage List for England the historic sewer pipe in Hillcroome Road.\nThis structure thus becomes the only structure in our Ward to be nationally listed as of historic and architectural significance, so it could only be altered or have work done on it if listed building consent was obtained. There are three other buildings in our Ward that are listed on the Local List of structures of local importance, which provides a lesser degree of protection. These are:\nthe Registrar’s office (The Russetings) in Worcester Road, a Victorian house that it is believed the Walls family, famous for Walls ice cream and Walls sausages, lived in, though this is disputed\nStowford in Brighton Road, a Victorian house, now the Eagle House school\nthe pavilion of the Highfield Lawns tennis club at the junction of Mayfield Road and The Ridgway, as an example of an Edwardian tennis pavilion, build by local builder Percy Vere Windebank in 1908\nThese Drain Pressure Release Pipes, also known as ‘Stink Pipes’, can be seen at various locations within the old Carshalton Urban District Council boundary. They have been listed on the basis of the criterion that they are important to the townscape view.\nThey were produced by W. Macfarlane & Co. of Glasgow, a prestigous Victorian Ironworks. The company employed imaginative designers and produced huge amounts of ornate and decorative ironwork. The pipes are extremely tall with an ornate top fixture comprising a large arrow, a globe with four trumpetlike funnels and a spike spire piercing a crown. The height and funnels may be to ensure the gas disperses efficiently so as not to inconvenience local residents. It is not known what purpose the arrow has, whether to indicate the direction of sewer flow or act as a weather vane to indicate wind direction.\nThey serve two purposes, firstly to prevent a build up of pressure in underground sewers in the event of a blockage, and secondly to vent off any hydrogen sulphide gas. This gas, which smells of rotten eggs, can build up when sewage becomes septic, on long runs, or when the speed of the sewage is slow in flat areas. It is extremely corrosive and can eat through the concrete pipes. The sewerage system would have become a necessity after the rapid increases in population and residences in Sutton and Carshalton at the end of the 1800s. Prior to this sewage would have been dispersed into cesspits and drainage ditches, with a risk of contamination of the drinking water supply, contributing to ill health.\nThe history of W. Macfarlane and Co. and their foundry, the Saracen Foundry, is fascinating. In 1851 Walter Macfarlane (1817-1885) established his company in a disused foundry in Saracen Lane in Gallowgate, Glasgow, and named it Saracen Foundry. It later moved to Washington Street, near the River Clyde. By 1872 his nephew, also named Walter MacFarlane (1853–1932), joined the rapidly expanding company and they relocated to Possilpark, a site of 100 acres on the outskirts of the city. Here a foundry with railway access and a village-styled infrastructure to house the workforce was built. In a decade it housed 10,000 people but the vast iron-founding site caused much pollution. The young MacFarlane made standardisation and good design the key to the company’s successful development. The foundry’s work was used on prestigous developments and widely distributed. During the Second World War Possilpark industrial works was a vast and well-lit target for attack. The recovery of iron to melt down for the war effort also removed much of Saracen’s work. After the war, the collapse of the British Empire, the move away from steam power and the use of new designs and materials led to a vast decline in orders. In 1967 the foundry at Possilpark closed.\nOne of the ways to combat global warming is to plant more trees. Richard and Trish have been responsible for getting the Council to plant many trees in our Ward, some to replace trees that were lost to disease but many new trees. Trees absorb carbon dioxide and pollution, and pump out oxygen. Sutton is amongst the leaders among the 32 London boroughs in the number of street trees per yard of pavement. This contributes to the pleasant, green, suburban atmosphere of the area we all so much enjoy, though it creates a headache every autumn when the leaves fall.\nThis planting activity has included trees in:\nUpland Road – outside 18, 20, 39. 103\nCamborne Road – outside 47/49, 32/34\nEffingham Close – 17, 26\nLangley Park Road – opposite 91 Egmont\nDevonshire Road – outside the school\nThe Ridgway – 18, 59\nChristchurch Park – one outside, and one opposite, White Lodge Close.\nThe Council’s programme for re-surfacing roads and pavements has been under pressure over recent years due to the impact of austerity and cuts to Government support to Councils. The Council has had to implement savings measures in order to survive, and it has been a struggle to maintain these programmes.\nThere is an annual programme of review of priorities for the resurfacing of roads and pavements and replacement of light columns. Last year, we were delighted by the re-surfacing of the pavement in Mayfield Road. The programme for the coming year includes more work in our Ward, including the re-surfacing of the footway in The Ridgway (pictured above) and the replacement of concrete light columns in a number of roads at the western end of the Ward –",

Perhaps the owners changed the name as – after it being empty for five years – they want to signal a new beginning for this building. They have spent money on the renovation and certainly improved the way it looks, as the pictures above show.\nThe apartments in the block, a few hundred yards south of Sutton station and in our Ward, are available to rent. The Acorn Group are in charge of renting out the flats. If anyone is interested in renting they can contact Kimberley Ellen (kimberley.ellen@acorn.ltd.uk or ring her 020 8315 6917). The flats are also advertised on the website Rightmove.\nOn 14 January Richard visited the block. It has been refurbished to a high standard and it is good to see it occupied. There are 128 flats with parking spaces.\nAs long ago as December 2015 we met with Council officers and the developer to discuss renovation of the front, to fit in with the Gateway scheme further north. We have sought agreement that the owners fund the renovation of the area in front of the building, to bring it up to the same standard as the area renovated during the “Gateway” project just to the north. The shops at the bottom are not fully let out and we have hopes that the area just south of the station will include of a mix of good restaurants, shops and maybe a wine bar as the area will have so much more footfall. We are pleased that the Rose cafe and Sofra are surviving. We look forward to the area in front of the building being renewed and improved in due course and the vacant shops let out. However Sainsburys have pulled out of opening a store at the bottom.\nThe area has in the past suffered from a group of “all day drinkers” who walk the streets drinking alcohol from cans. However, one of Richard’s first acts when elected in 2010 was to get the “no drinking” zone extended from Sutton town centre into Sutton South Ward. This makes it unlawful to drink alcohol in public in the area if a police officer asks you to stop.",

I am sorry it has not yet done so. This policy weakens planning law further and will lead to neighbour on neighbour disputes over ugly extensions. It is a recipe for neighbourhood disputes and the erection of ugly buildings that society does not want, and that we certainly do not want in Sutton. ”\nThe motion pased on 5 November was also critical of the envisaged interference of the Planning Inspectorate in local decisions on planning applications, affordable housing and section 106 contributions.\nThis is the full text of Richard’s speech:\n“It is right that the London Borough of Sutton, which has been at the intellectual vanguard of so many policies in local Government, should be at the forefront in leading a campaign against the proposals of the Government to weaken planning law.\nThe motion is a balanced motion in that we are complimenting the Government on aspects of the announcement made on 6 September that we support, but we are making clear what we oppose.\nWe support proposals concerning the funding of new affordable housing, the refurbishment of empty homes, support for the FirstBuy shared equity scheme and support for housing associations.\nBut we are critical of the extension of permitted development rights, and the envisaged interference of the Planning Inspectorate in local decisions on planning applications, affordable housing and section 106 contributions.\nWhat we are saying tonight is entirely consistent with our actions and our words on planning issues.\nIt is consistent with our words in that we had an excellent debate on planning policy at the Council meeting on 17 October last year. I remember speaking in that debate and noting what we have achieved in Sutton in adopting and refining a planning policy that has secured the green, pleasant, suburban character of Sutton that we all treasure. But we noted in that debate threats and concerns that arose from national policy. We welcomed many aspects of the National Planning Policy Framework but saw four difficulties with the planning system that should be addressed – and for each of these I could cite specific examples in Sutton South Ward:\n1. that what is permitted development is already quite permissive and is leading to people building large and intrusive structures that should be brought within planning controls\n2. that the planning system is slow moving in dealing with developers who are recalcitrant and play the system\n3. the decisions of the Planning Inspectorate are sometimes inconsistent and unhelpful\n4. the Courts do not always seem to take breaches of planning law seriously.\nThese problems remain but, sadly, the Government has not taken our advice set out in the motion we passed. Indeed, it has moved in an opposite direction in what is now proposed.\nWhat is proposed seems to abandon the National Planning Policy Framework, does not address any of the problems that concerned us, and loosens further permitted development law.\nI do not believe for one second that the relaxation of requirements to seek planning permission for extensions to domestic properties is going to unleash an avalanche of building work, thus creating jobs. To the extent that this happens, it follows that this will be through the erection of buildings that would not be permitted under current arrangements. So this is a recipe for neighbourhood disputes and the erection of ugly buildings that society does not want, and that we certainly do not want in Sutton.\nI also particularly object to the way the package deals with affordable housing and section 106 contributions. Like most of you, I find that quite a lot of my casework as a Councillor involves families that are living in poor circumstances, often because they cannot find and afford accommodation that fits their needs. We desperately need more affordable housing. There are already “get out” clauses for developers who present financial analyses seemingly proving their development is unviable if they have to provide affordable housing. I am deeply suspicious of those processes and now there are to be further “get out” routes involving the Planning Inspectorate.\nWhat we say in this motion is also consistent with our actions. We have adopted stringent controls on development to ensure it meets the local needs of Sutton, particularly on the development of major sites and on back garden development. We do not want these interfered with by remote bodies in Whitehall and Bristol.\nWe have worked hard to control development in Sutton in a way that meets what local people want. And so much flows from the way the character of the area is preserved by our planning policies, making it an attractive environment for businesses and families. I never tire of telling people of the virtues of Sutton – low crime, good schools, attractive leafy streets, good transport connections, voted the best place in London to bring up children, a local economy that is surviving the recession well. All these things, to my mind, hinge crucially on having an attractive local environment and street scene.\nI hope these proposals will be re-thought.\nI strongly believe, in the words of the motion, that it is local people, through democratically elected local authorities, who are the best judges of what development is acceptable in an area.\nI commend this motion to Council.”",

Our residents are spread between a number of surgeries and many (including Richard) use the Grove Road surgery. There is no disputing that this building, a converted house, is not the best place for a surgery and it does not meet the best standards. However, closing it and moving to Homeland Drive is not the best move, as the new building is not on a bus route and it is a difficult walk for those with mobility problems from the nearest bus stops in the Brighton Road. Increased traffic at the site will give rise to safety concerns. We believe there are better sites, such as locating the surgery at the Sutton hospital site, where part of the site is shortly to be vacated. This is not, of course, an issue on which the decision rests with the local Council. An application for planning permission has been made, but issues that concern whether there are better sites are not planning issues on which a decision to turn down the application could be based.\nThe following is the text of a letter we sent to the Sutton Guardian:",

It outlines some of the challenges facing the capital, including housing, employment and transport.\nSutton Council, business and residents support the tram extension, which will improve transport links in and out of, and across, Sutton. The project will also create and sustain new jobs, drive economic growth, ease traffic congestion and reduce CO2 emissions.\nWe understand the original draft of the Mayor’s vision document made no mention of bringing the tram to Sutton, but our Tramlink campaign, still in its infancy, has already yielded a result. The Mayor of London is asking us to demonstrate how this investment will be justified by the improvements it can bring in terms of jobs, growth, and housing.\nSutton is already one step ahead. We have commissioned research which demonstrates that extending Tramlink to Sutton will create 10,000 jobs, bring forward sites for residential development, and support and boost the economy.\nWe know that extending Tramlink will ensure Sutton continues to prosper into the future. The Borough of Sutton has had an ambition to bring Tramlink to Sutton since 2003 when it was included in the Unitary Development Plan. The Borough has successfully worked with Transport for London to examine the feasibility of bringing trams to central Sutton, connecting it to St Helier Hospital, Morden Tube Station and Wimbledon. At some point a spur through our Ward, Sutton South, would connect to the Marsden hospital. This feasibility work is ongoing, and Sutton’s Tramlink campaign seeks to ensure the Mayor will continue to fund this work in Transport for London’s future budgets.",

These are people from all over the world who share a desire to be British citizens, and have taken examinations in the English language and in our history and way of life to obtain citizenship. On 16 December there were people from Iraq, Sri Lanka, India, Hong Kong and Rwanda. On 10 November there were people from Ethiopia, India, Nigeria,Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bulgaria, Tunisia, South Africa and Zimbabwe, all of whom had successfully applied for British citizenship. On 8 December there were people from Nepal, Sri Lanka, India, the Ukraine, South Korea, the USA and the Congo.\nRichard says “I find these ceremonies moving. Britain benefits enormously from being a multi-racial society, with so many different cultures learning from each other. These people will be a great credit to Britain, and are enthusiastic about becoming British citizens. They will bring to our country cultures and experiences that we will learn from and which will make Britain a better place.”\nThis is the text of his speech of welcome, elaborating on the standard speech normally made at this ceremony in order to draw particular attention to the many advantages of setting up home in the London Borough of Sutton, and the benefits to Sutton of the skills and experiences that people from such diverse backgrounds bring to our community.\n“It is indeed a great pleasure for me to extend my personal welcome you all, as well as welcoming you on behalf of the London Borough of Sutton and on behalf of the government of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the second.\nI am delighted that you have either chosen Sutton as a place to live or have chosen Sutton to celebrate this very special occasion.\nSutton cherishes its diversity and today we are celebrating this with all of you, people who come from many different parts of the world. You bring with you cultures and experiences which we will value, and which can help to continue to make Sutton a great place to live and to work. You have many opportunities to participate in the local community, in particular by volunteering to help in a wide range of groups and activities where your expertise and experience would be invaluable to the community.\nMany of you have children. Sutton is proud to have excellent schools and opportunities for our young people. We look to inspire young people so they develop and thrive in a learning environment. This year students at Sutton schools achieved the best GCSE results in the country.\nA recent study rated Sutton as the best place in London to bring up children. The study looked at factors such as low crime rates, affordability of houses, earnings and access to good schools, and concluded that Sutton is the best Borough in London to set up home. So, for those of you who have set up home in Sutton, congratulations on making such a wise choice.\nSutton is also the Borough with the highest percentage of residents in work – 78% of Sutton’s working age population has a job, and there is evidence that in this period of recession Sutton remains vibrant.\nThe green spaces and parks in Sutton enable everyone to enjoy their leisure time. Sutton is proud of its “green” environment – having over 1 500 acres of parks and open spaces and over 20 000 street trees. There is also a wide range of other facilities in the Borough such as libraries, theatres, and the Life centre, which encourages citizenship and learning.\nHistorically Sutton has been linked to the Queens and Kings of England. King Henry 8th was frequently a visitor to the Borough having a home in Nonsuch park.\nThis house that we are in today is a fine example of Victorian architecture, once inhabited by the Walls family, a name you may recognise, famous for their Walls Ice Cream and Walls Sausages. But there are many other heritage sites worthy of a visit including Whitehall in Cheam and The Honeywood centre in Carshalton. Since 1965 this building has been the Register office, registering important life events such as births, deaths marriages, civil partnerships and – today – people choosing to take British citizenship.\nAs we look across the world and realise how fortunate we are to live in a democracy, I urge you all as new citizens to use the opportunity to vote in our elections, to shape the future of the Borough and your new country. Your next opportunity to do that will be in May, when we elect a new Mayor of London and a London Assembly.\nMay I congratulate you all and wish you happiness and success as new British Citizens. “\nThis is Richard with the Registrar, who conducted the ceremony.",

The Development Control Committee considered, on 8 June, minor changes to the conditions attached to the development proposal. We still have no timetable for the development.\nKey points we have made are that residents continue to raise concern about the state of Sutherland House and its continuing deterioration now that it is unoccupied. In addition to the large number of windows that are boarded up, the retail premises, previously occupied by an estate agent, are now also boarded up, adding to the general dilapidation of the area. This presents anyone entering Sutton from the South with an unpleasant and off putting view .\nSome residents remain concerned about the proposals that have been agreed. However, in the interests of the area as a whole, we need development to go forward, to improve the appearance of the building and as an occupied building will mean that the office workers and residents are spending money in local shops and restaurants, making the economy of South Sutton more vibrant. But we must register concern at the current state of the building and have sought to require the owners to improve the external view, e.g. more attractive boards surrounding the building.\nIn speaking to the Committee on 2 March Heather reminded the Committee of the concerns raised by residents of Grosvenor Court and Forest Dene. Heather said that the current state of the building was a disgrace. Windows were smashed and boarded up. The doorways were refuges for drinkers and smokers and full of litter. The space below the iron railings on Cedar Road was a rubbish tip and a health hazard containing unsightly and unhealthy waste from fast food outlets. And the building had been host to a cannabis factory, or even a plantation given the huge amount of the weed grown there.\nAlthough unable to revisit the details of the planning application, Councillor Honour pointed out that the car parking, consisting of 62 bays was inadequete for the proposed 96 flats and 70 bedroomed hotel. There were already serious parking issues at nearby Sutton Court and this would only exacerbate the situation.\nRoad safety was already an issue at the junction of Cedar Road and Brighton Road and many of the residents at Forest Dene feared to cross the road there. The proposed entry to the lower cark park would worsen the situation and Councillor Honour advocated using Wellesley Road for the entry to the car park.\nShe also drew attention to the fact that the original planning application had said that the hotel would be commissioned from Hilton Hotels on behalf of the Hampton brand. The latest information was that the hotel was likely to be either the Premier Inn or Travelodge chain. Would their branding conflict with the approved design of the hotel?\nHighlighting the fact that most of Sutton South was now a mixture of private flats and social housing and that there was insufficient open space in the area, she said that 50 per cent of children did not have access to a garden and she asked that under the new Community Infrastructure Levy the developer be asked to improve the Devonshire Nature Area and contribute to more open space for the surrounding community.\nOur latest information is that the development is not likely to follow the current planning permission but will be a much more limited development, reflecting the current economic circumstamces.\nTo use the CIL provisions, I understand that a London borough council would need to have adopted the community infrastructure levy (CIL) and have imposed the appropriate charge on developers undertaking developments which are chargeable under the LBC’s CIL scheme.\nThe council or the “neighbourhood” could then improve and pay for any open space provision necessitated by the proposed development. (The neighbourhood would be able to use CIL (if any) allocated to it by the LBC.\nAn alternative which may be available at present is the “section 106” Agreement – here the developer might pay a for local improvements if appropriate.",

  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_page_43/content_249.html": "Councillor Clifton nominated the Edwardian tennis pavilion that sits on the triangle of land where The Ridgway joins Mayfield Road in our Ward for inclusion on the Sutton Local List. At the Sutton Council meeting on 9 May 2011 the pavilion was included in the list of buildings to be added to the Sutton Local List.\nThis is the only building in Sutton South Ward to be included on the Local List, though the Registry Office in Worcester Road is on the national list of Listed Buildings.\nThe building is the only one of the buildings put forward as additions during the consultation process to make it to the final list. This was attributed to the fact that Councillor Clifton had put forward a carefully researched case, including adequate evidence.\nThe Sutton Local List is a list of buildings thought to be of importance to the comunity, though not of sufficient merit to be “Listed Buildings” for inclusion on the national list. The list thus includes local buildings of significance to the local community. Sutton Council has been consulting on additions to the Local List and, at a presentation to the Sutton South, Cheam and Belmont Local Committee on 27 January, it became evident that not one single building in Sutton South Ward was under consideration for inclusion on the local list. This led to Councillor Clifton proposing inclusion of the pavilion.\nThe inclusion of the pavilion on the list may be helpful in the preservation of the character of this area as an Area of Special Local Character (ASLC), and thus resisting any inappropriate development in the area, such as demolition of houses and erection of blocks of flats, which has been the trend in adjacent areas. At a Planning Appeal attended by Councillor Clifton last year he had to explain to the Inspector the importance of local people of the ASLC and why it should be taken into account in the planning decision.\nCouncillor Clifton said:\n“I am delighted with this outcome. One of our key objectives, as local Councillors, is to preserve the character of the Area of Special Local Character at the east end of Sutton South Ward. We must resist the trend to knock down houses and build small blocks of flats, which has led to a shortage of family homes in many parts of Sutton South Ward, and half the children living in accommodatin with no access to a garden. This recognition of the importance of buildings such as the Edwardian tennis club to the special character of the area may be helpful to us in pursuing that objective.”\nIn proposing the pavilion, Councillor Clifton wrote:\n“It is an Edwardian tennis pavilion, built in 1908 by the local architect Percy Vere Windebank, on the triangle of land at the junction of Mayfield Road and The Ridgway, in South Sutton Ward. It is a relatively unaltered example of a small, Edwardian tennis club pavilion, though the windows have been altered in an unsympathetic manner.\nThe history of the building is interesting. Up to 1906 this area was lavender fields. Between 1906 and 1914 Windebank laid out the Highfields Estate, building what is now The Ridgway, Mayfield Road , Chalgrove Road and Hillcroome Road . The concept was an estate of large, expensive houses with large gardens, grouped around or close to a triangle of land on which there would be a lawn tennis and croquet club, for the benefit of the residents. In 2008 the Highfields Residents’ Association published a history of the estate, “Highfields 100”, to mark the centenary. A copy of this history, to which Councillor Clifton is listed as a contributor, is obtainable from Mr Keith Percy at 63 The Ridgway, SM2 5JX. The houses are of some architectural merit, as indicated in the history.\nWe believe the pavilion was built by 1908, as the Highfield Lawns tennis club was in existence by that year. On 22 August 1908 an advertisement for the first of the newly-built houses on the estate was published in the Surrey County Herald newspapers, and mentioned the private tennis club on the estate. Highfield Lawns Ltd. was established as a company by 1913 with the sole objective of owning the land in order to allow the tennis and croquet club to operate. Those who bought one of Windebank’s houses could buy shares in Highfield Lawns. The Articles of Association of the company provide, to this day, that if you own a share in the company you can only vote on its affairs if you also own property in the Highfields Estate.\nOver the years the large gardens have been sold off for infill housing, mostly of a good quality. The area is designated an Area of Special Local Character (ASLC) and the Edwardian tennis pavilion is central to the character of the area.

We have responded to point out that these services are of value to those living in south Sutton, the Belmont to Tooting service being an important south-north link and the Heathrow service providing a means of getting to the airport at reasonable speed by bus without having to go in to central London. We would not want to see these services withdrawn or reduced.\nIn support of the points we have raised, the Council has written formally to Transport for London to set out the concerns of local people. The council has recorded that the X26 is a highly valued service providing an orbital bus link through the Borough and a speedy route to Heathrow. The Council has sought an extension of the frequency of the service, which is half hourly during the day but only hourly after 7pm, to be half hourly during the evening. The Council has pointed out that the service is often crowded during the day and has sought an increase in the frequency of the service to once every 20 minutes.\nThe Council has also stressed the importance of the 280 route, connecting local people to Mitcham and Tooting. It has commented that the timetabling of the service could be improved.\nAs your local Councillors, we will closely follow this consultation process and seek to ensure these services are retained and, if that can be justified, improved.",

And in Copse Hill we also intervened to get Council officials to look at the potential for a flooding problem at the foot of the hill, with the cleaning out of the soakaways and other improvements.\nAction to improve the Devonshire Avenue Nature Area, involving, amongst other things, re-positioning the benches, partially removing a wall that divides up the site, possibly fencing some areas with low wooden fencing to protect the kidney vetch essential for the small blue buterfly, removing the corrugated iron sheeting found at the site and installing a small piece of play equipment for children aged 5 to 7 at the entrance, while taking action to control the habitat. The reserve is the only open space in the Ward. We have supported only limited installation of play equipment as we believe the area should continue to be a nature reserve, and our proposals are designed to ensure the habitat of the area will not be harmed.

There is a narrow pavement and, as it is a one-way street, cars roar round the corner from the Brighton Road end and under the bridge, the driver only seeing a pedestrian on the pavement under the bridge at the last moment.

There are many residents of our Ward who commute to central London for work and approach the station from the Wellesley Road direction, so have the same experience every working day as Richard had.

There were discussions involving the Council, Network Rail and Transport for London. It was confirmed that the firm intention, now, is to open the side entrance. The project is more complex than simply putting a row of entrance gates where the shutter closing the side entrance is currently situated. There will be some re-building of the side entrance, a canopy, gates and the very steep flight of stairs (too steep to comply with the Disability Discrimination Act) will be replaced by a flight at right angles to the current flight of stairs, at a more gradual gradient.\nRichard said “This is exciting news for Sutton South residents.

This picture shows Sutherland House – it is hoped that the seat outside Sutherland House can be restored if the problems associated with public drinking in this area can be dealt with ]\nSutton Council has extended what is popularly called the “No Drinking” zone to our Ward.\nEven before we were elected, we were aware of the concerns of local residents and the problems of anti-social behaviour associated with a group of what are sometimes called “all day drinkers”. These people often congregated at the Brighton Road / Cedar Road intersection.\nFollowing a number of discussions that we, as Ward Councillors, had with the Council Executive member responsible for public order matters, Councillor Graham Tope, the Council has taken steps in a policy direction that we have advocated, to deal with the problem.\nAt present, the town centre in Sutton is a “Designated Public Place” – popularly called a “No Drinking” zone. An effect is that the group of people who drink on the street for much of the day congregated just outside the zone, in particular at the street corner at the end of Cedar Road where it meets the Brighton Road. This is close to Forest Dene Court, a large block of flats for elderly people, some of whom have expressed to us their concern about this group of drinkers. Now, the Council has extended the zone to cover an area of Sutton South Ward.\nThe area covered is a square bordered by Cedar Road, Langley Park Road, Egmont Road and the Brighton Road. The police were able to provide evidence of anti-social behaviour associated with drinking to justify including this area in the zone. Now the zone is extended to this area, the police will monitor the effect. If the problem is simply displaced to a different area, consideration can be given to a further extension.\nThe legal effect of the Designated Public Places Order is that if someone is drinking alcohol in public in this area the police can ask them to stop. If they do not stop, they are guilty of an offence.\nThe designation of the Sutton South zone was subject to public consultation. Statutory notices were placed in newspapers and on relevant websites on 11 January. Representations could be made during the consultation period, which ended on 7 February. A second statutory notice was published. The order came into force on 15 March 2011.\nAs your local Councillors, we are delighted with these developments, which we have pressed for, with the Council. We have had the support of the local police and the Sutton South police consultative committee (whose activities are reported elsewhere on this website, on the page on police matters). As a result of this development the police will be able to spend less time dealing with the anti-social behaviour associated with public drinking and spend more time on their two other priorities for our Ward, car crime and drug dealing.\nWhen the results of the new measures are clear, we hope it will then be possible to restore the seat outside Sutherland House, which was removed as it became associated with public order problems caused by this group of people.",

There were many different angles to consider and Heather addressed them in her contribution to the debate.\n“None of us can be comfortable about closing a care home for some of the most vulnerable people in our community.\nAnd one that has an excellent reputation.\nI visited Oakleigh as part of the investigation by the Health and Wellbeing Scrutiny Committee. The residents were happy and very well looked after. Care staff were totally committed to their work. I would be comfortable to see a relative of mine live there.\nI took therefore an challenging approach to the scrutiny exercise we undertook about Oakleigh.\nFrom the outset, I was shocked at the very high weekly cost to look after each resident. (one thousand and twenty four pounds) £1,024.\nThis confirmed research I’ve read from from the Dept of Health. Care homes run by councils are much more costly than those run by independent organisations. This is a nationwide phenomenon.\nIn the wider context, Sutton’s grant was dramatically cut by central government. We have to save over £30 million over the next 3 years. Savings of £10.5 million have to be found from the adult social care budget.\nSo the financial situation makes keeping an excellent, but costly, Oakleigh less possible.\nCurrent good practice says that people should be helped to stay in their own homes for as long as possible. Many would prefer to do so provided the right level and quality of support is there.\nAs part of the personalisation agenda, introduced by the last government, everyone eligible for social care has their own budget. This is based on what their needs are assessed to be. They should then be able to make their own choices about how to spend their money. All this has to happen within 18 months.\nThis means that it could be difficult for people to afford to stay at Oakleigh.\nThe key question is therefore whether there are other good quality care homes available in the borough?\nAs part of our investigation, we visited a wide range of care homes and found a wide range of quality.\nThe star rating system by the Care Quality Commission was not as helpful as we expected. ( now to be discontinued) Oakleigh was given a 3 star rating. Most care homes in the borough were given a 2 star rating. We found that some of these were excellent, some not very good.\nWe therefore recommended, that the Commissioning Unit and social workers, should work together to improve standards in those homes that had 2 stars.\nWe needed a Sutton based quality assurance, reflecting our values and standards. We could not rely on the Care Quality Commission. That organisation is in any case changing.\nWe also recommended that we should challenge the regulations that prevented us from transferring the business of Oakleigh to another, independent provider.\nOnce again Sutton demonstrated its commitment to consultation. It did challenge the Care Quality Commission successfully, and then went out for another 12 weeks consultation. Few councils would take that trouble.\nUnfortunately, no independent organisation was ready to bid for Oakleigh, probably because of the financial obligations when staff are transferred from one organisation to another.\nSo I have reluctantly concluded that there is no alternative to closing Oakleigh. I do realise what a blow this will be to those still living there, and to the hard working staff. Great efforts will be made to help people find new homes. Like my colleague I would like to say a big thank you to Link and to the dedicated staff at Oakleigh.”",
  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_author_richardclifton_page_42/content_436.html": "Councillor Clifton nominated the Edwardian tennis pavilion that sits on the triangle of land where The Ridgway joins Mayfield Road in our Ward for inclusion on the Sutton Local List. At the Sutton Council meeting on 9 May 2011 the pavilion was included in the list of buildings to be added to the Sutton Local List.\nThis is the only building in Sutton South Ward to be included on the Local List, though the Registry Office in Worcester Road is on the national list of Listed Buildings.\nThe building is the only one of the buildings put forward as additions during the consultation process to make it to the final list. This was attributed to the fact that Councillor Clifton had put forward a carefully researched case, including adequate evidence.\nThe Sutton Local List is a list of buildings thought to be of importance to the comunity, though not of sufficient merit to be “Listed Buildings” for inclusion on the national list. The list thus includes local buildings of significance to the local community. Sutton Council has been consulting on additions to the Local List and, at a presentation to the Sutton South, Cheam and Belmont Local Committee on 27 January, it became evident that not one single building in Sutton South Ward was under consideration for inclusion on the local list. This led to Councillor Clifton proposing inclusion of the pavilion.\nThe inclusion of the pavilion on the list may be helpful in the preservation of the character of this area as an Area of Special Local Character (ASLC), and thus resisting any inappropriate development in the area, such as demolition of houses and erection of blocks of flats, which has been the trend in adjacent areas. At a Planning Appeal attended by Councillor Clifton last year he had to explain to the Inspector the importance of local people of the ASLC and why it should be taken into account in the planning decision.\nCouncillor Clifton said:\n“I am delighted with this outcome. One of our key objectives, as local Councillors, is to preserve the character of the Area of Special Local Character at the east end of Sutton South Ward. We must resist the trend to knock down houses and build small blocks of flats, which has led to a shortage of family homes in many parts of Sutton South Ward, and half the children living in accommodatin with no access to a garden. This recognition of the importance of buildings such as the Edwardian tennis club to the special character of the area may be helpful to us in pursuing that objective.”\nIn proposing the pavilion, Councillor Clifton wrote:\n“It is an Edwardian tennis pavilion, built in 1908 by the local architect Percy Vere Windebank, on the triangle of land at the junction of Mayfield Road and The Ridgway, in South Sutton Ward. It is a relatively unaltered example of a small, Edwardian tennis club pavilion, though the windows have been altered in an unsympathetic manner.\nThe history of the building is interesting. Up to 1906 this area was lavender fields. Between 1906 and 1914 Windebank laid out the Highfields Estate, building what is now The Ridgway, Mayfield Road , Chalgrove Road and Hillcroome Road . The concept was an estate of large, expensive houses with large gardens, grouped around or close to a triangle of land on which there would be a lawn tennis and croquet club, for the benefit of the residents. In 2008 the Highfields Residents’ Association published a history of the estate, “Highfields 100”, to mark the centenary. A copy of this history, to which Councillor Clifton is listed as a contributor, is obtainable from Mr Keith Percy at 63 The Ridgway, SM2 5JX. The houses are of some architectural merit, as indicated in the history.\nWe believe the pavilion was built by 1908, as the Highfield Lawns tennis club was in existence by that year. On 22 August 1908 an advertisement for the first of the newly-built houses on the estate was published in the Surrey County Herald newspapers, and mentioned the private tennis club on the estate. Highfield Lawns Ltd. was established as a company by 1913 with the sole objective of owning the land in order to allow the tennis and croquet club to operate. Those who bought one of Windebank’s houses could buy shares in Highfield Lawns. The Articles of Association of the company provide, to this day, that if you own a share in the company you can only vote on its affairs if you also own property in the Highfields Estate.\nOver the years the large gardens have been sold off for infill housing, mostly of a good quality. The area is designated an Area of Special Local Character (ASLC) and the Edwardian tennis pavilion is central to the character of the area. Were it to be proposed to demolish and re-build the pavilion any replacement would need to be a building of a similar character (not a modern building or a concrete slab) due to the ASLC designation. If the Local List is a list of buildings of some local significance, the pavilion should be on the list. This is based on criteria 3, a building of significant local interest.”\nCouncillors Clifton and Honour would welcome information on any famous people who have lived in Sutton South Ward, for consideration as to whether there should be a plaque erected on the property where they lived.\nThis is a picture of the clubhouse taken from the triangle in The Ridgway.

Thus it replaces a requirement that helps poor people living in rented accommodation by one that helps wealth people who can afford to buy a property\n- “All of this will affect our social tenants, but also private tenants who are living in squalid and overcrowded accommodation in this Borough, who will not be able to obtain social housing due to the reduction in the stock. The loss of social housing to rent on such a scale is a crisis. The loss of social housing to rent on such a scale is an attack on the poor. The loss of social housing to rent on such a scale is a very serious consequence of the policies of the current Government.”",

The man was forced to run and jump onto a vehicle to avoid being bitten.\nAs a result the resident was sent a letter on the 13th April advising that this incident had come to the attention of police. A second letter was sent on 2nd July after her dogs had continued to behave in an unacceptable way.\nThis second letter included an Acceptable Behaviour Contract – a voluntary agreement between the resident and Sutton Council, the Met Police in Sutton and London and Quadrant Housing Trust – the resident’s landlord.\nThe contract only named one of her dogs – Governor – as she had given up Roxy at around this time. The conditions in the agreement include:\n- The dog being kept on a lead no longer than three metres in a public place including Langley Park Road, public footpaths and roads within Sutton borough\n- Clearing up after her dog\n- Regularly exercising her dog\nFailure to comply with the agreement may result in an Anti-Social Behaviour Order being obtained to stop the resident causing harassment, alarm or distress and the tenancy agreement being reviewed and even revoked.\nThe action is part of borough’s Local Environmental Awareness of Dogs (LEAD) initiative to make owners of all breeds of dog aware of their responsibilities to their pet and the wider community.\nSince August 2011 a total of 27 letters have been sent to residents whose dogs have come to the notice of police.\nPC Heath Keogh, of Sutton Police station, who is co-ordinating the LEAD initiative for the borough, said: “Whilst we want to work with residents to reduce the nuisance and concerns caused by their pets, we are equally determined that we will take whatever action we need to make sure that this happens in reality.\n“The bottom line for Sutton residents is a breach of an ASBO which could result in five years jail or a fine or both, and a possession order leading to a tenant’s eviction, for those in rented accommodation.”\nThe LEAD initiative was prompted by the fatal dog attack in Demesne Road, Wallington, on 23 December 2010, when a 52-year-old woman died after being attacked by a dog.",

She is determined to find out what mistakes were made, who was at fault and what impact it will have on future healthcare in south west London.\nThe South West London Joint Health Overview and Scrutiny Committee on NHS Croydon finances met for the first time on 6 September and set itself the task of answering three crucial questions.\nFirst, how was it that on 8 June 2011 the year’s accounts were signed off with a £5.54million surplus, yet when the same books were re-examined a year later they revealed a £22.7million overspend?\nSecond, why were officers – charged with managing a huge and vital job – not properly monitored, and were they given the right tools to do the job?\nAnd, third, why in July 2012 did the South West London Cluster Board decide to try to cover up the huge deficit as a ‘prior period adjustment’?\nHeather, one of two Sutton councillors sitting on the committee, said: “It is vital that we reach the bottom of this and that we do that quickly.\n“If this is the sort of financial mismanagement we see from NHS bosses how can we be sure that the NHS BSBV team, which is after all proposing a multi-million pound plan which would close vital parts of St Helier Hospital, be able to run such a huge scheme successfully? Their track record is simply dreadful.”\nSome observers believe the problems started in April 2010 when NHS Croydon was given the added responsibility of hosting London Specialised Commissioning Group. It is thought that running the £800million project may have stretched the resources of officers beyond their ability to cope.\nThe committee, which is comprised of councillors from Sutton, Richmond, Croydon, Merton, Wandsworth and Kingston, meet again on 24 September. It will call a number of witnesses including Ann Radmore, Chief Executive of NHS South West London.\nMs Radmore was appointed Sector Chief Executive for South West London in 2009 and led the establishment of the SWL Cluster in early 2010.\nAnother witness will be Dr Peter Brambleby, who was Croydon’s Director of Public Health from March 2010 to February 2012. On 6 July he blew the whistle on NHS London’s decision on 28 June to try to hide the deficit as a ‘prior period adjustment’ which, despite Dr Brambleby’s revelation, the South West London Cluster tried to repeat on 26 July.\nHeather added: “Key personnel involved in the Better Service Better Value team planning the future of healthcare in south west London are involved in this Croydon mess. What confidence can we have in their plans for St Helier?”",

Each year the Council has a leaf clearing programme in place, where a team is deployed to all roads/streets that suffer from significant leaf fall. No Council can keep every road entirely free of leaves during the autumn leaf fall period, as resources are not unlimited. However, there is a programme that will, over a period, gradually clear away the fallen leaves.\nAs part of the South London Waste Partnership contract with Veolia, dedicated resources are provided for leafing, in support of the core street cleaning service. The operation is in two parts.\nFirst, throughout the borough leaves should be cleared by beat sweepers as they break down and start to lose their shape and structure. Gully grates should also be kept clear, by beat sweepers, to help minimise surface water runoff and drainage. Second, the dedicated Veolia team will work to clear leaves throughout the borough, aiming to ensure they do not become hazardous to road users and pedestrians, turning into detritus and blocking road-side gullies with danger of flooding. If there are particular streets that residents feel need to be addressed more urgently, we ask that this is done through the Report It function on the Council website.\nCommencement of the dedicated resource is a joint decision with Veolia and is based on the level of leaf fall and forecast weather conditions. The leaf fall programme is likely to start in the first week of November. There is an operational document that schedules which roads will be visited by the dedicated leafing team and when. As with all operational documents, and particularly with leafing, those involved have to be prepared to respond to weather conditions, to locations where demand and need is greatest, taking decisions on the basis of available resources. This means that the schedule is being constantly reviewed.\nIf residents or a community/resident group would like to get involved in clearing leaves from streets or communal areas please contact Council officers. Simply complete our Community Clean-Up Event Form with a few details. We can provide bags for use and will arrange for them to be collected from a pre-arranged location.\nLeaves from residents own property can be disposed through our paid for Garden Waste service or taken free of charge to the reuse and recycling centre at Kimpton Park Way, Sutton SM3 9QH. Alternatively, a garden composting bin could be used.\nResidents should not sweep leaves from their own property into the road.\nStudents returning to school at the start of the 2020 autumn term at Overton Grange enjoyed a quieter and safer atmosphere due to the introduction of a “school street” at the gates in Stanley Road at the time students arrived and left for the school day. This involved the closure of the part of Stanley Road adjacent to the school for a short period in the morning and afternoon, when the school day starts and ends.\nThe objectives of school streets are:\n1) To improve safety around the school at start and finish time\n2) To improve air quality for children outside their school gates (small people are particularly vulnerable to emissions from cars)\n3) To create a more welcoming atmosphere around the school, where children can walk in the road and parents can feel more relaxed.\nThe scheme was a six month trial funded by Transport for London, who set the parameters of the scheme. The scheme was withdrawn in advance of the conclusion of the six month trial following a legal challenge to the lawfulness of such schemes, but by then it was proposed to withdraw the scheme. This related to difficulties experienced in enforcing the traffic controls, which at successful “school street” schemes involved the participation of the school and parents.\nWhen Richard was first elected in 2010 one of the first projects he initiated was to get the “No Drinking Zone” in the centre of Sutton extended to our Ward. There were a group of what the police termed “all day drinkers” who used to congregate on Cedar Road outside Forest Dene Court.\nThe zone was extended to cover the area of our Ward south of the station as far as Cavendish Road, and running west to east from Brighton Road to Langley Park Road. In this area it is unlawful to continue to drink alcohol if asked by the police to stop, and there are provisions that would enable the police to confiscate alcohol. You will find reminders of the provisions attached to lampposts in the area, for example in Cedar Road.\nThe Council has, by law, to re-consider and consult afresh on these provisions from time to time. It is doing so at present. You can comment or make representations on the proposal to maintain these provisions. Representations must be made in writing and addressed to Safer Sutton Partnership Service, Environment, Housing and Regeneration Directorate, Sutton Police Station, 6 Carshalton Road, Sutton, SM1 4RF, before 21st September 2020. You need to state the grounds on which your representation or objection is made.\nIf you have any questions about this consultation, you can contact the Safer Sutton Partnership Team via email at safersutton@sutton.gov.uk.\nThe reduction in traffic in our residential roads at the height of the lockdown brought quiet, clean air, blue skies and a wish to preserve the pleasant environment it created. We have obtained, from schemes established by the Government and the London Mayor to deal with the aftermath of the pandemic, funding for plans to maintain these advances. The schemes are trials and will be monitored throughout the initial six months. Normally the Council would consult extensively before their introduction but the offer of funding is for immediate action following emergence from lockdown, so the measures will be introduced and monitored to assess resident reaction and their impact. The principal proposals include, in our Ward:\n* The Permit Parking Area (PPA) planned for roads from Mayfield Road running east as far as Banstead Road South, which residents strongly supported in consultation exercises, will be introduced from 30 November. This should reduce traffic and parking in this area\n* An extension of the 20 mph speed limit area in Langley Park Road to roads to the east, as far as Banstead Road South, has been introduced. This includes the part of the Ward where a PPA is to be introduced, so the reduced parking will lead to speeding, which has to be dealt with to maintain the peace and quiet of these residential roads\n* An experimental “modal filter” (allowing cyclists and pedestrians to cross but not other vehicles) to reduce traffic rat running north to south through the area, at Kings Lane, has been introduced. This will be subject to assessment after introduction and maintained if there is resident support. The impact on traffic in Langley Park Road and other local roads will be monitored. A proposal for a second filter, in Langley Park Road, remains in the programme but will not be implemented while Sutton Court Road is closed at the west end, and will be subject to review in the light of an assessment of the impact on traffic in the area from the Kings Lane filter\n* A“school street” at Overton Grange school to deal with traffic at the school gates has been implemented, closing the road where the school is situated to traffic when school students are arriving and leaving, so they can do so in safety and quiet. This involves the closure of Stanley Road south of the junction with Camborne Road when Overton Grange students are arriving and leaving.\nThese improvements will help maintain the peace of the quiet residential roads in our Ward, improve air quality, make the area more pleasant for walking and cycling, and benefit the neighbourhood. We hope to create a neighbourhood with less noise, less non-residential traffic, less speeding, cleaner air and a safer and more pleasant environment, promoting walking and cycling.\nThe proposals also respond to the many of the concerns raised by residents in the survey last year supporting the Council’s Liveable Neighbourhoods bid to the Mayor of London. These were:\n1. Too much rat-running traffic 2. A wish for more trees, plants, greenery 3. A need for improvement to air-quality 4. A need for slower vehicle speeds on residential roads 5. More pedestrian crossings on main roads 6. More welcoming streets for walking 7. More welcoming streets for cycling\nWe will be monitoring closely the impact of these measures and traffic levels were monitored in local streets in August. Normally the Council would consult extensively before their introduction but the offer of funding is for immediate action following emergence from lockdown, so the measures will be introduced and monitored to assess resident reaction and their impact. If, after the initial experimental six month period, the Council was minded to retain the schemes on a permanent basis there would be full resident consultation on a traffic management order.\nOn the criteria for evaluation of the temporary schemes, this is what TfL are asking us to use.\nWe will look at a range of factors when considering whether or not to make a temporary scheme permanent. These include the:\nEffects the scheme has had and could continue to have on road safety and pedestrian overcrowding\nNumber of cyclists and pedestrians who have used each scheme\nContribution each scheme makes to the look and feel of the local area\nImpact of the scheme on traffic, including the bus network\nFeedback from the public and other stakeholders\nImpact of the scheme on people protected under the Equality Act 2010\nBy way of background, the Low Traffic Neighbourhoods scheme was set up by the Conservative Government in consultation with the Labour London Mayor. A total of 859 schemes are being trialled across London for six months from September, and the rules for these schemes were set up by Central Government at very short notice. The Government asked for bids from every London Borough in mid May that had to be made within just a month, by 22nd June, which is not ideal.\nThe choice of areas was based on past requests to Local Committees, suggestions made by residents, and proposals previously made under the Transport for London (TfL) Liveable Neighbourhoods bid.\nThe Department for Transport advise that the six months long trials of the temporary schemes will enable further consultation if it is intended to make any of the schemes permanent. The benefit of a trial is that one can see if a scheme works or does not work, or can be improved. Where these schemes have been set up elsewhere in London they have often proved popular with residents.\nIn normal non- Covid times, we would have expected longer notice of bidding for schemes to allow for public consultation but the Government did not allow the usual process (which normally takes some months), on this occasion, as the timescale was telescoped into a very short one, of one month only.\nOn 20 June Trish and Richard attended an event at the open space opposite St Helier hospital to support the Black Lives Matter movement.\nIt was difficult to estimate the size of the crowd as it was spread out over a vast area to ensure social distancing. The police attended to ensure social distancing was observed, which it was. Trish made an excellent and impassioned speech, as did her daughter Lauren. Lauren told us that the previous day she had submitted, as part of her University course, a dissertation on mental illness in prisons. A finding had been that BAME prisoners were much more likely to be affected. Councillor Dombey also spoke.\nThe renowned artist Lionel Stanhope has brightened up our Ward. The painting, on the railway bridge at Sutton station, is not easy to photograph, so what is shown below is a CGI of the artwork created before the painting was undertaken. What is above, is the painting.\nThe railway bridge at Sutton station has been brightened up with a painting by the renowned artist Lionel Stanhope, whose art has brightened up many railway stations. Stanhope completed the painting in four days starting on 26 May. Stanhope is regarded by many as a better and more important street artist than Banksy. We have been pleased to support this project which brings an attractive feature to add interest to the area.The façade of the railway bridge, as you come out of Sutton station and turn left,was a patchwork of various colours. The Council first tried to interest Network Rail in making the bridge look more attractive, over four years ago, during the “Sutton Gateway” project, which involved re-paving the area around the station and the installation of the clock opposite Sutton station. The artwork has been mainly funded by Network Rail, with a small contribution from Sutton Council. The parapet of the bridge required extensive cleaning and preparation before the painting commenced. Lionel Stanhope produced a design which incorporates the word “Sutton” in the typeface traditionally used by Southern railway, and a depiction of the historic Sutton locomotive. The locomotive “Sutton” came into the possession of the Council many years ago and is a 144 year old, 28 tonne, 26 feet, A1 class Terrier steam engine. It is currently with a heritage railway undertaking in Tunbridge Wells who have undertaken to restore it. The painting is an addition to an area becoming famous for its street art. Within two hundred yards you can find the remarkable statue “The Messenger”, located directly outside the entrance to Quadrant House in The Quadrant. The Messenger is a statue, a sculpture in bronze with very dark patination, completed by David Wynne in 1981, of a large horse and rider. It was a major commission for the sculptor, who died in 2014. It took four years to complete from his first idea and inspiration, on receipt of the brief – through roughing out, refining and casting in a foundry, to the final unveiling and installation. We are not including a photograph of the statue in this post due to the philistine attitude of the owners of Quadrant House, who do not cherish this artwork and have stuck a notice on the front of it about some aspect of building maintenance, thus disfiguring it. They have been unco-operative in the face of requests to remove the notice. Even more striking is the remarkable mural by the famous Spanish “street” artist from Bilbao, Eva Mena, on a wall in nearby Wellesley Road. This is said to be of the American singer and musician Erykah Badu. The work was commissioned by the owners of the building, Indepth Hygiene Services. It was painted in three days in 2010, when the artist came over from Spain to paint it. It is entirely typical of her street art, which is to be found on walls in many parts of the world, including Egypt, Ireland and Spain, as well as Sutton. Eva Mena is said to be more famous than Banky in her native Spain.\nThe Local Government Boundary Commission for England has been reviewing the boundaries of the local Government Wards in Sutton prior to the next local elections in 2022.\nThey published draft proposals last year and have now published final decisions. You can view these on their website.\nTheir final decisions leave the Ward much as it was, with the addition of a part of Mulgrave Road. The new structure they outline will be the structure of Wards at the next Council elections in 2022. The new Ward will be one of the largest Wards in the borough.\nCurrently the Ward runs from Sutton station in the north to Devonshire Road in the south, and Banstead Road South in the east to Overton Road in the west. It is mostly a Ward of residential roads with three schools (Devonshire Avenue primary, Overton Grange, Eagle House school), one small park (the Devonshire Avenue Nature Area), three places of worship (Christchurch, the Friends’ Meeting House, the synagogue in Cedar Road), split into three parts by Langley Park Road and Brighton Road running north-south.\nThe draft proposals published earlier this year removed from the Ward roads east of Upland Road – Kaymoor, Willis, Prior, Downside, Farm Close – and put them into Carshalton Beeches Ward. There were minor adjustments at the western end so the whole Ward moved westwards.\nIn drawing up new boundaries, the Commission is required to aim to deliver electoral equality for voters in Council elections so that each Councillor represents roughly the same number of voters. The review also aimed to ensure that the new Council wards reflect, as far as possible, the interests and identities of communities across Sutton.\nThe final proposals leave the Ward much as it was, with the addition of a small part of Mulgrave Road. The new Ward will be one of the largest Wards in the borough.\nAfter a debate on 14 October Sutton Council submitted some proposals. Richard spoke in this debate, commenting in particular on the proposals fro Sutton South Ward. He said:\n“I recognise that there is always a tension between drawing lines on maps that create sensible geographical structures in terms of communities and natural boundaries and getting the numbers right in terms of residents per Councillor. I would like to stress that where these create tensions I think it important to give priority to getting the boundaries right, creating areas that residents recognise as communities, in particular respecting natural boundaries such as main roads and railway lines, and keeping recognised communities together, and this should be the priority even if it does lead to some unevenness in Ward sizes. In any exercise like this there will inevitably be some disparity in the size of Wards with some outliers.”\nThe Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, advised by Historic England, has added to the National Heritage List for England the historic sewer pipe in Hillcroome Road.\nThis structure thus becomes the only structure in our Ward to be nationally listed as of historic and architectural significance, so it could only be altered or have work done on it if listed building consent was obtained. There are three other buildings in our Ward that are listed on the Local List of structures of local importance, which provides a lesser degree of protection. These are:\nthe Registrar’s office (The Russetings) in Worcester Road, a Victorian house that it is believed the Walls family, famous for Walls ice cream and Walls sausages, lived in, though this is disputed\nStowford in Brighton Road, a Victorian house, now the Eagle House school\nthe pavilion of the Highfield Lawns tennis club at the junction of Mayfield Road and The Ridgway, as an example of an Edwardian tennis pavilion, build by local builder Percy Vere Windebank in 1908\nThese Drain Pressure Release Pipes, also known as ‘Stink Pipes’, can be seen at various locations within the old Carshalton Urban District Council boundary. They have been listed on the basis of the criterion that they are important to the townscape view.\nThey were produced by W. Macfarlane & Co. of Glasgow, a prestigous Victorian Ironworks. The company employed imaginative designers and produced huge amounts of ornate and decorative ironwork. The pipes are extremely tall with an ornate top fixture comprising a large arrow, a globe with four trumpetlike funnels and a spike spire piercing a crown. The height and funnels may be to ensure the gas disperses efficiently so as not to inconvenience local residents. It is not known what purpose the arrow has, whether to indicate the direction of sewer flow or act as a weather vane to indicate wind direction.\nThey serve two purposes, firstly to prevent a build up of pressure in underground sewers in the event of a blockage, and secondly to vent off any hydrogen sulphide gas. This gas, which smells of rotten eggs, can build up when sewage becomes septic, on long runs, or when the speed of the sewage is slow in flat areas. It is extremely corrosive and can eat through the concrete pipes. The sewerage system would have become a necessity after the rapid increases in population and residences in Sutton and Carshalton at the end of the 1800s. Prior to this sewage would have been dispersed into cesspits and drainage ditches, with a risk of contamination of the drinking water supply, contributing to ill health.\nThe history of W. Macfarlane and Co. and their foundry, the Saracen Foundry, is fascinating. In 1851 Walter Macfarlane (1817-1885) established his company in a disused foundry in Saracen Lane in Gallowgate, Glasgow, and named it Saracen Foundry. It later moved to Washington Street, near the River Clyde. By 1872 his nephew, also named Walter MacFarlane (1853–1932), joined the rapidly expanding company and they relocated to Possilpark, a site of 100 acres on the outskirts of the city. Here a foundry with railway access and a village-styled infrastructure to house the workforce was built. In a decade it housed 10,000 people but the vast iron-founding site caused much pollution. The young MacFarlane made standardisation and good design the key to the company’s successful development. The foundry’s work was used on prestigous developments and widely distributed. During the Second World War Possilpark industrial works was a vast and well-lit target for attack. The recovery of iron to melt down for the war effort also removed much of Saracen’s work. After the war, the collapse of the British Empire, the move away from steam power and the use of new designs and materials led to a vast decline in orders. In 1967 the foundry at Possilpark closed.\nOne of the ways to combat global warming is to plant more trees. Richard and Trish have been responsible for getting the Council to plant many trees in our Ward, some to replace trees that were lost to disease but many new trees. Trees absorb carbon dioxide and pollution, and pump out oxygen. Sutton is amongst the leaders among the 32 London boroughs in the number of street trees per yard of pavement. This contributes to the pleasant, green, suburban atmosphere of the area we all so much enjoy, though it creates a headache every autumn when the leaves fall.\nThis planting activity has included trees in:\nUpland Road – outside 18, 20, 39. 103\nCamborne Road – outside 47/49, 32/34\nEffingham Close – 17, 26\nLangley Park Road – opposite 91 Egmont\nDevonshire Road – outside the school\nThe Ridgway – 18, 59\nChristchurch Park – one outside, and one opposite, White Lodge Close.\nThe Council’s programme for re-surfacing roads and pavements has been under pressure over recent years due to the impact of austerity and cuts to Government support to Councils. The Council has had to implement savings measures in order to survive, and it has been a struggle to maintain these programmes.\nThere is an annual programme of review of priorities for the resurfacing of roads and pavements and replacement of light columns. Last year, we were delighted by the re-surfacing of the pavement in Mayfield Road. The programme for the coming year includes more work in our Ward, including the re-surfacing of the footway in The Ridgway (pictured above) and the replacement of concrete light columns in a number of roads at the western end of the Ward –",

The result was\nLiberal Democrats 1291\nConservatives 327\nReform 282\nLabour 216\nThree other candidates (the Greens, an independent and the Christian People’s Alliance) each got less than 100 votes.\nThe Liberal Democrat share of the vote increased by 17.4%, the Conservatives fell by 10% and Labour – who finished second in this seat in 2022 – by 17.4%.\nOn 3 March the Council discussed the budget proposals for the coming year. Legally, the Council is required to set a balanced budget. With so many Councils going bust or in great financial difficulty, this was always going to be a difficult task. The problems are due to a legacy of Government cuts but also a big spike in demand for services. While people think of the Council as the body that mends the potholes, empties the bins and fixes the street lights, 70% of spending is on adult social care and children’s services (particularly for those children with special educational needs), plus the cost of finding accommodation for the homeless. There has been an increase in demand in the past year, particularly in the number of adults whose social care has to be paid for by the Council, the number of children with special educational needs and in the number of homeless families.\nRichard spoke in the debate, on homelessness – a subject in which he has a special interest due to the work history of his daughter, Ellie, who worked for many years for a homelessness charity and because as chair of Planning Committee he has a role in increasing the supply of affordable family accommodation.\nHere is Richard’s speech:\n“I would like to direct the attention of Council to paragraph 8.11 of the supplemental agenda which is discussing financial risks.\nIt says that the biggest driver of overspending by London boroughs is the number of people presenting as homeless and who need to be offered temporary accommodation.\nThe paper tells us Sutton had 1 084 households homeless and in temporary accommodation in October last year. It is a higher figure tonight. It is a frightening figure. Tonight we are discussing homelessness as a financial risk to the Council, but we all recognise that the fundamental reason for our concern is that behind so many of these cases are stories of tragedy, of families losing their homes and often winding up in bed and breakfast accommodation remote from their workplace and remote from the schools their children attend.\nThere is a housing crisis and we need more homes. Residents comment on the number of new flats being built in the centre of Sutton but we need this accommodation.\nThe aspiration of the Government to build more homes is right – but it has to be tempered by a concern about quality and about dealing with the consequences.\nSutton is very built up. It is not always easy to see where the new homes will come from, particularly when we are all rightly sensitive to the concerns of residents about inappropriate development and the pressures intensification can bring.\nIt is worthwhile re-stating the principles in our local plan for Sutton.\nWe need more housing, but it must be of good quality – good enough for Sutton, which means of high quality.\nWe aim to reduce development pressures on what I call the “suburban heartland” of the borough by concentrating development in the areas where development is appropriate.\nIn particular there is a zone of potential intensification close to the town centre where public transport connections are good. This may mean some tall buildings. It may mean car free or car light development as you can provide much more accommodation if you do not have to provide a parking space for every unit, and this is more acceptable in areas close to the railway station and the town centre where public transport connections are good.\nWe have a local plan, currently under review, which sets out how we meet the requirements for infrastructure to support an increase in population, which is an important concern of residents.\nI am always keen to point out that our local plan is not like the local plan you might find in, for example, North Korea, mandating what will be built. It is aspirational. It depends on developers bringing forward proposals. Its success depends a lot on the skills of our planning staff in negotiating with developers to secure what is good for Sutton, which may not be what makes most profit for the developer. I would like to pay tribute to the work of our planning staff and in particular the head, Andy Webber, who retires this month.\nIn the past year the planning system has had a bad press. The Government says we are going for growth, growth, growth. Quite right. But when asked what are the impediments to growth they invariably cite the planning system – which is represented as run by NIMBYS frustrating necessary development. That might well be the case in some places – not here in Sutton of course. But I think there is a counter argument that the planning system is a bastion against having fields and fields of sub-standard housing, as that is what makes money for developers. We destroy the planning system at our peril. But it is also right that we need a planning system that does not stand in the way of necessary change and renewal, but ensures high quality and appropriate development, to provide housing and to stimulate the economy.\nI think we have a good track record in Sutton in supporting high quality development and there are many examples in our borough of developments characterised by good design providing quality housing and infrastructure. That is what we need.”\nThe bench at the junction of The Ridgway and Mayfield Road\nThere are a number of locations in our Ward where there are benches to enable weary pedestrians to put up their feet. At the most recent meeting of the Council’s local committee we got agreement to re-new two benches in the Ward that have deteriorated over time. These are benches in Copse Hill and the one in the photograph, which is at the junction of The Ridgway and Mayfield Road.\nThere is a history to some of the benches in our Ward. In 1988 the South Sutton Neighbourhood Association celebrated the tenth anniversary of its foundation by funding a bench in Cavendish Road close to Ambleside Gardens. The bench was, after over twenty years of use and exposure to the elements, in a very sorry state. We took action to get the bench restored, with the plaque explaining the history of the bench moved to the new bench.\nOn the 27th of January Sutton Council met. Richard raised the issue of the reasons why a recent survey by The Times newspaper ranked Sutton as the eighth most attractive place to live in England. This finding does not surprise us. We spend a lot of time knocking on the doors of our residents to introduce ourselves as your local Councillors and we find people generally say they really like Sutton, mentioning a strong sense of community, open spaces, low crime, good schools, a green and pleasant environment, parks, street trees, being convenient for London and for the countryside. This is particularly the case with people who have moved to Sutton from elsewhere, particularly those from other London boroughs, from Hong Kong and from Ukraine. Please write to us and tell us what you like about Sutton or think we can improve.\nWe are always keen to look at ways of improving our Ward.\nLast year traffic engineers undertook a study of traffic flows in our Ward and the results of the exercise are listed in a later post on this site. The results have not led to some “standout” conclusion as to a problem that needs tackling but traffic officers are examining three main issues:\nwhether action can be taken to improve the safety and the experience of pedestrians crossing the Kings Lane bridge without closing the road to vehicles. The bridge is narrow. Installing a second bridge would be impossibly expensive. Marking a pedestrian path at one side of the road might be feasible. We would welcome the views of users of the bridge, both pedestrians and motorists\nsimilarly, whether something can be done to improve the safety and the experience of pedestrians passing under the railway bridge in Langley Park Road. Some proposals are to be consulted on\npossible improvements to the busy junction where Cedar Road crosses Langley Park Road. Residents have spoken to us of the difficulties pedestrians have in crossing Langley Park Road. Consultation with residents in adjacent streets is underway on proposals to install two new traffic islands in Langley Park Road. These will form a safe area in the middle of the road so the road can be crossed by pedestrians in two phases.\nYour views on these issues, and views on any other traffic and parking issues you would like us to look at would be welcomed.\nThe police met residents of Sutton South Ward again on the evening of 15 January 2025, at Devonshire Avenue school. There are open, public meetings held quarterly at which the police discuss the policing of the Ward with local residents. We were addressed by our Ward Constable, Constable Robyn Skivens, who went through the crime statistics for the Ward. Sutton has a lower crime rate than most outer London boroughs and our Ward has one of the lowest crime rates in Sutton. However, crime always has a significant impact on the victim and public concern remains high. The draft minutes of the meeting are as below.\nSUTTON SOUTH COMMUNITY / POLICE MEETING. 15 JANUARY 2025 Attended by PC Robyn Skivens and PCSO Helen Maguire for the police. A report was given on main crime trends from 1 September to the date of the meeting. DRUG OFFENCES There had been 18 drug offences, mainly possession of drugs, mainly cannabis. While this was higher than normal the increase was partly attributable to a special police operation at Sutton train station. Four of these crimes were the interception by the Border Force of drug shipments. Where such a shipment is to premises in our Ward it will count in our statistics. BURGLARY There had been 21 burglaries or attempted burglaries. This included residential burglaries, burglaries of garages and sheds, and some burglaries of businesses. It was noted that there was usually a seasonal increase in burglary at this time of year as it was darker earlier. There had been eight residential burglaries. However, some that had been reported in sheltered accommodation in the Ward were later disproved and attributed to dementia. A disturbing case was that of a landlord who was able to let himself into a flat and commit theft. Two burglaries of garages had involved theft of bicycles. Mention was made of a shop in Brighton Road where the window was smashed and the wooden panel that was then put in place to secure the premises was pulled away to facilitate burglary. Mention was made of the theft of tools from a construction site in the Ward. Some burglaries had involved the theft of keys, which were then used to commit further offences (theft of a car key leading to theft of a car). The police stressed the need to make sure keys were kept out of sight – if the keys can be seen from your letterbox you are inviting crime.\nVEHICLE CRIME\nThere had been 14 instances of vehicle crime (theft of vehicles, damage to vehicles, theft from vehicles). The police stressed the need to avoid leaving anything of value on display in your car, or in the car at all. An unusual crime had been the theft of an excavator and a dumper from the road works in Brighton Road. THEFT There had been 23 crimes in a category the police described as “theft and kindred (to theft)” events. This included shoplifting, parcel theft, theft of pedal cycles and mobile phones. Examples mentioned included theft of scrap metal, theft of a wheelie bin and theft of a wedding ring by distraction techniques. MAJOR CRIMES There had been nine major, violent crimes in the Ward. This included several robberies at the train station, a large group altercation outside a restaurant, a fight between two drug users, and a concerning incident of a woman who was followed from the station and robbed. There were also two incidents of arson, of a bin and of a Ford transit. A ULEZ camera was deliberately damaged. There was an incident where a drug user was searched and a knife, and bladed articles, were found to be in his possession. There was a disturbing incident of an anti-semitic symbol being daubed on a wall outside the synagogue in Cedar Road. There had been a succession of incidents related to a woman living in Cedar Road who had engaged in anti- social activities that had attracted a community of drug users to her premises. This was now the subject of police reports to the DPS that were expected to lead to her being charged with serious offences. SPEEDING The police had been conducting a programme of visits to local care homes and sheltered housing to talk about scams. Residents had raised with them concerns about speeding in Cavendish Road, which had led to police action in that road. There was a discussion of speeding in local roads including Chalgrove Road, Langley Park Road, The Ridgway and Cavendish Road. The police had been carrying out speed checks in Chalgrove Road and Cavendish Road. The action in Cavendish Road had led to twelve drivers receiving warnings. The police would consider further action against speeding in local roads, subject to resources.\nOTHER MATTERS DISCUSSED Staffing levels: There should be in theory be a third officer on the Ward to support Robyn and Helen, but they were coping. The number of “extractions” when they were called away to join police exercises elsewhere in London, or at the Croydon custody suite, remained an issue of concern but was now running close to 35% of their time rather than the 50% it had once been. Mention was made of local concern about a story that a body had been discovered at a house in Egmont Road. The police assured the meeting that there was no wider implication of this incident. The next meeting was tentatively scheduled for Wednesday 14 May at Devonshire Avenue school (7pm) subject to the police checking their work rota. The meeting thanked Robyn for coming back from leave to attend the meeting and thanked the officers for their work for the community in dealing with crime in the Ward. The meeting thanked Fiona Ostler for letting us meet at the school. The date of the next meeting was provisionally set as Wednesday 14 May, at Devonshire Avenue primary school and thought continues to be given to what could be done to better publicise the meeting and get a better attendance.\nConstable Skivens, Louise, Trish and Richard with other Ward police officers at the Sutton South Hello Christmas party\nThe Phoenix Concert Band – which is based in our Ward and for which Richard plays trumpet – were busy over the Christmas period raising money for the Mayor of Sutton’s charity appeal. The band practices every Friday in the church at Christchurch in Christchurch Park. A concert in the church, staged by the band in December, drew an audience of over a hundred and raised £790 for the charity appeal. The band also played Christmas carols at an event in the Straw cafe in Manor Park in December, which raised £360. On the last Saturday before Christmas the band joined a wider group of musicians to play Christmas carols in the atrium of the St Nicholas shopping centre in Sutton (see photo) which raised £180, so £1330 in all. We were grateful to the Mayor, Councillor Colin Stears, who attended all these events. In addition the band played a concert at the Friends’ Meeting House in Cedar Road on the second Saturday in December, to entertain an enthusiastic audience before the “Second Saturday Tea” which the Quakers provide every month on the second Saturday. The Mayor of Sutton’s charities are Home-Start, Sutton, and Sutton, Kingston and Epsom – Parkinson’s UK. Our contribution to the appeal was dwarfed by the £10 000 prize for second place in the boroughs’ competition won by the Sutton float in the London New Year’s Day parade.\nWe pride ourselves on the fact that we have a network of dedicated volunteers who deliver our “FOCUS” magazine throughout the Ward. If you have the odd half hour a few times a year to support us in this way please contact us. We recently prepared an end of year newsletter to update our volunteer deliverers on our activities. We thought we would share it with those who look at our website.\n“The last year has been our most successful year in Sutton South Ward. With the election of Luke as our Member of Parliament in July we have, for the first time, three Liberal Democrat Councillors representing our Ward and a Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament representing us at Westminster. We held a successful Ward meeting on 28 November where we heard from Luke on the incredibly busy life he now has as our Member of Parliament. He has been meeting all the important community groups in Sutton and Cheam, and has made speeches in Parliament on a variety of issues – ranging from the importance of support for carers to the future of Taiwan. In his maiden speech he spoke about what a pleasant place Sutton is to live, work and raise a family, a great change from the previous MP who spent all his time running Sutton down. He is enthusiastic about his role as spokesperson for London. As Ward Councillors, we have a lot of local casework that we deal with and are doing more than our fair bit as Chairs of Council committees – Trish chairing the Audit and Governance Committee, Richard the Planning Committee and Louise combining being chair of the Licensing Committee with her role as Deputy Mayor. This is her second year as Deputy Mayor following the three years during which Trish was Mayor.\nLike every local authority, Sutton Council is pre-occupied by financial issues and struggling with some difficult decisions to balance the books. The decision to close the Registrar’s office (The Russetings) in Worcester Road was one we regretted, driven by a need to consolidate services in fewer buildings, but we believe planning controls are sufficient to protect the appearance of this attractive, locally listed, building in the street scene.\nWe have secured funding for improvements to the WArd, including new information signs at the only open space in our Ward – the Devonshire Avenue Nature Area (DANA). Maintenance of the nature area involves a balance of ensuring it is a peaceful place for people to visit while preserving the biodiversity of the site. There is now a Friends of DANA group – let us know if you would like to join it. We are already looking forward to our next electoral challenge, to retain control of the Council in 2026. We need to keep up the work of talking to our residents, delivering our literature and doorknocking. Let us know if you are interested in being one of our candidates. We welcome talking or corresponding with you and with all our residents. We hope to have further Ward meetings next year. We are really grateful for the help we get.”\nSutton South Councillors were concerned to learn about changes proposed to the organisation of the Police Cadets, who meet at a school in our ward. Currently there are over 120 cadets. However, the decision has been made to close junior cadets and cut the remaining senior cadets to just 46. Their future programme is also being severely curtailed. This will have a major impact on the youth of this borough who will no longer have the opportunity to participate in activities such as camps, parades and Duke of Edinburgh awards.\nCouncillor Louise Phelan, whose son has been a Cadet, commented “I’ve seen first-hand the benefits of being part of police cadets. They learn valuable life skills, and gain self confidence. They also support the local community and get to take part in things they wouldn’t otherwise have had the opportunity to do. For many this is a stepping stone into a career within the police force, for others the Cadets help to keep them on the right path and make better life decisions. I am incredibly concerned others will now not get these opportunities.”",
  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_about/content_193.html": "Trish was first elected to Sutton Council on 22 May 2014. Richard had been a Councillor for the previous four years. They were re-elected on 3 May 2018 and 5 May 2022. Louise was elected on 5 May 2022. We have all lived here for many years, so have a deep understanding of the opportunities that come from living here. We are all determined to work hard for the local community.\nTRISH says “I have lived in Sutton for over 30 years and my daughters Alexandra and Lauren were born in St. Helier hospital. Alexandra is a dentist, Lauren a university student.\nI am passionate about education. My younger daughter attended St. Philomena’s where I fund raised with the Parents’ Association. She is now at Uni. My elder daughter is a dentist.\nI worked in the insurance industry for 30 years and now run my own business. I hope to put that experience to good use in encouraging small businesses.”\nSome things you need to know about Trish:\n- she was born and brought up in Eniskillen in Northern Ireland, the eldest daughter in a family of nine children, at a time when Northern Ireland was plagued by what is now referred to as “The Troubles”\n- she is an international sportswoman, representing Northern Ireland at netball\n- she is a great entrepreneur, having owned and run companies ranging from insurance companies to the only wine bar in our Ward\n- prior to being elected Mayor in May 2020 she was Chair of Sutton Council’s Licensing Committee\n- she was Mayor of Sutton for three successive years.\nRICHARD SAYS\n“I have lived in Sutton South Ward for over thirty years so have a good understanding of the area and of the opportunities and problems of living here. I think it a wonderful place to live and I am so grateful to my fellow citizens in Sutton South for giving me this opportunity for public service, by electing me as a Councillor for the area I live in and really love.\nI was active in politics in the 1960’s, when I was President of the Union of Students at the University of Warwick. Those who have read the book “Warwick University Limited” by E.P. Thompson will know that at that time Warwick was a hotbed of radical ideas. I was for many years a member of the Labour Party but joined the SDP (Social Democratic Party) when it was formed in the 1980’s and, by that route, joined the Liberal Democrats when the former Liberal party merged with the SDP.\nI have been married to Gloria, who was a museum curator and Head of the Royal Observatory in Greenwich until she retired, for over 50 years. Gloria is now a Curator Emeritus of the National Maritime Museum, and is continuing her research interests in the history of scientific instruments, on which she is an internationally recognised authority. Both of our children went to Devonshire Avenue primary school, in our ward, and to a local State secondary school, Nonsuch. I am very proud of my daughters. Jane, who sadly died of a brain tumour in 2017, was a barrister, and Ellie has given the community great service by working as a marketing and communications officer for a charity for the homeless in Birmingham (St. Basil’s). She also founded and was the first editor of a newspaper for the homeless (The Pavement, West Midlands), something she did as an unpaid volunteer. She now works for Worcester cathedral.\nMy elder daughter, Jane, was married in 2010. Her husband Tetteh is also a barrister. His family come from Ghana though he was born in Northern Ireland. The wedding took place in the Gladstone Library of the National Liberal Club. Tet now works as a senior barrister for the Crown Prosecution Service.\nIn June 2015 they presented me with my first grandchild, Ciaran. Here they are in St. Thomas’s hospital the day after the birth. Sadly, Jane died two years later, of a brain tumour. I spend a lot of time child minding Ciaran.\nHere is a picture of my younger daughter, Ellie, at her wedding, in 2009. Her husband, Jeff, works in IT. They were married at the beautiful country church of St. Bartholomew, in Tardebigge, in Worcestershire . They have a lovely daughter, my grandaughter Livi, and a son, Theo.\nI have been active in local organisations, including at one time being chair of my local residents’ association, the Highfields Residents’ Association.\nFor much of my career I worked in public service and I was at one time the chair of the Board of the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, based in Bilbao, in Spain. This is the principal European Union agency in this field. Given this experience, it was perhaps inevitable that when elected to Sutton Council I would be invited to be chair of the Sutton Joint Health and Safety Committee. My experience as chair of the board of a European Union Agency and, during my career, taking part in European Union Council of Ministers working group meetings negotiating Directives on subjects as diverse as genetic modification and the safety of machinery, made me a strong supporter of the European Union. Having a group of people from a number of different countries sitting round a table agreeing what is in effect an international standard is of immense value to the citizens of all these countries. I was disappointed at the decision to leave the European Union. I was until April 2011 head of the binational (UK – France) safety organisation for the channel tunnel, established by international Treaty, but decided to retire from this role to concentrate on my activities as a Councillor. I still find time to play the trumpet in a Sutton-based concert band and some other local bands.”\nLOUISE was elected to Sutton Council on 5 May 2022, joining Trish and Richard as Councillors for Sutton South Ward. Louise was Deputy Mayor of the borough for the year 2023-24 and is Deputy Mayor again this year. Her son Harry is officially titled the “Consort” of the Deputy Mayor. Louise has lived in Sutton for over 20 years and her son attends Overton Grange school in our Ward. She is an active member of many local community organisations and was a leading member of the Sutton New Town Community Festival, serving as chair of the organisation.",
  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_page_15/content_585.html": "Richard completed his year as Mayor, and Gloria her year as Mayoress, on 22 May. Richard raised over £26 000 for his charity appeal for Sutton Shopmobility and the Alzheimer’s Society.\nIn the course of his Mayoral year Richard attended several hundred events in the Borough. The range of these events is enormous. They include:\n- opening the various open-air festivals, carnivals and fêtes that are held in Sutton in the summer months\n- opening new shops, pubs and business premises\n- attending events at churches, mosques, the synagogue and schools\n- attending school prizegiving evenings at most of our schools in Sutton\n- taking part in many Citizenship ceremonies, at which local residents from distant parts of the world took British citizenship\n- attending many 100th birthday parties\n- attending scout camps\n- attending award ceremonies, particularly for young people and for the many groups of cadets – police cadets, sea cadets, air cadets and the combined cadet forces of some of our schools\n- turning on the Christmas lights, which he did four times.\nAnd of course hundreds of events organised by the many voluntary groups in Sutton. And going to a few football and cricket matches, not just Sutton United but many local teams who have invited him to their games and to give out the awards at end-of-season prizegivings.\nHe has also represented the Borough at important events in London and in Surrey where the Borough should be represented, ranging from the pan-London Citizenship Ceremonies organised by the Mayor of London to more poignant occasions such as the service at Westminster Abbey to remember those killed in the terrorist action in Westminster last March.\nHe has also held receptions in the Mayor’s Parlour for about a dozen groups of people whose contribution to Sutton needs to be recognised – including carers, the local business community, food bank volunteers, the arts network, and of course Sutton United Football Club.\nRichard recollects that there was a day in March when, in one day, he opened the new Poundland store in Sutton town centre, opened the Red Lion pub in Hackbridge which had been closed for re-furbishment, attended a 100th birthday party for a local resident, and held a reception for food bank volunteers in the Mayor’s Parlour. And there were two other invitations on that day that he had to pass to his Deputies as he could not fit them in. This demonstrates the demands on his time\nRichard has had to do some challenging things as Mayor, including dressing up as Father Christmas to go out with the Sutton and Cheam Rotary Club collecting money for charity. This has left him with a rich fund of anecdotes about his discussions with small children when dressed as Father Christmas, which he offers to regale people with.\nRichard sometimes had to chair the Annual General Meetings of local groups who have it in their constitution that the Mayor will chair their AGM. Chairing Council meetings is sometimes a bit tricky, so you would think that chairing the meetings of bodies like the Sutton Swimming Association, Sutton Seniors Forum and the Friends of Whitehall would be a doddle. It was not always so.\nRichard said when he was elected that he hoped his Mayoralty would be remembered for some good music. There have been some great concerts to support his charity appeal, including by The Surrey Yeomanry Band, the Sutton Youth Wind Orchestra, The Phoenix Concert Band, the Norwood Wind Ensemble and the Show Choir – not to mention the group of musicians led by Richard that played Christmas carols in the St Nicholas Centre on several Saturdays before Christmas to raise funds, and the performance by the Clockhouse Choir at one of his dinners. Councillor Wendy Mathys attended all his concerts so deserves a special prize.\nIt has to be said that 2017 was a good year to be Mayor of Sutton as the year will be remembered as ranking alongside 1970 (remember Leeds United) and 1989 (remember Coventry City) as a year when Sutton United football club achieved great things in the FA Cup. The Mayor was one of the people guaranteed a ticket for the Sutton United v. Arsenal match, when the team acquitted themselves with honour, so a good year to be Mayor. There was worldwide interest in the Arsenal match, so much so that before the match he was much in demand for interviews on the general theme of “where is Sutton?”. He was interviewed by radio and TV teams from, amongst other places, Turkey, Russia and South Korea.\nRichard’s charity appeal has raised over £26 000 for his two excellent charities.",

The problems are due to a legacy of Government cuts but also a big spike in demand for services. While people think of the Council as the body that mends the potholes, empties the bins and fixes the street lights, 70% of spending is on adult social care and children’s services (particularly for those children with special educational needs), plus the cost of finding accommodation for the homeless. There has been an increase in demand in the past year, particularly in the number of adults whose social care has to be paid for by the Council, the number of children with special educational needs and in the number of homeless families.\nRichard spoke in the debate, on homelessness – a subject in which he has a special interest due to the work history of his daughter, Ellie, who worked for many years for a homelessness charity and because as chair of Planning Committee he has a role in increasing the supply of affordable family accommodation.\nHere is Richard’s speech:\n“I would like to direct the attention of Council to paragraph 8.11 of the supplemental agenda which is discussing financial risks.\nIt says that the biggest driver of overspending by London boroughs is the number of people presenting as homeless and who need to be offered temporary accommodation.\nThe paper tells us Sutton had 1 084 households homeless and in temporary accommodation in October last year. It is a higher figure tonight. It is a frightening figure. Tonight we are discussing homelessness as a financial risk to the Council, but we all recognise that the fundamental reason for our concern is that behind so many of these cases are stories of tragedy, of families losing their homes and often winding up in bed and breakfast accommodation remote from their workplace and remote from the schools their children attend.\nThere is a housing crisis and we need more homes. Residents comment on the number of new flats being built in the centre of Sutton but we need this accommodation.\nThe aspiration of the Government to build more homes is right – but it has to be tempered by a concern about quality and about dealing with the consequences.\nSutton is very built up. It is not always easy to see where the new homes will come from, particularly when we are all rightly sensitive to the concerns of residents about inappropriate development and the pressures intensification can bring.\nIt is worthwhile re-stating the principles in our local plan for Sutton.\nWe need more housing, but it must be of good quality – good enough for Sutton, which means of high quality.\nWe aim to reduce development pressures on what I call the “suburban heartland” of the borough by concentrating development in the areas where development is appropriate.\nIn particular there is a zone of potential intensification close to the town centre where public transport connections are good. This may mean some tall buildings. It may mean car free or car light development as you can provide much more accommodation if you do not have to provide a parking space for every unit, and this is more acceptable in areas close to the railway station and the town centre where public transport connections are good.\nWe have a local plan, currently under review, which sets out how we meet the requirements for infrastructure to support an increase in population, which is an important concern of residents.\nI am always keen to point out that our local plan is not like the local plan you might find in, for example, North Korea, mandating what will be built. It is aspirational. It depends on developers bringing forward proposals. Its success depends a lot on the skills of our planning staff in negotiating with developers to secure what is good for Sutton, which may not be what makes most profit for the developer. I would like to pay tribute to the work of our planning staff and in particular the head, Andy Webber, who retires this month.\nIn the past year the planning system has had a bad press. The Government says we are going for growth, growth, growth. Quite right. But when asked what are the impediments to growth they invariably cite the planning system – which is represented as run by NIMBYS frustrating necessary development. That might well be the case in some places – not here in Sutton of course. But I think there is a counter argument that the planning system is a bastion against having fields and fields of sub-standard housing, as that is what makes money for developers. We destroy the planning system at our peril. But it is also right that we need a planning system that does not stand in the way of necessary change and renewal, but ensures high quality and appropriate development, to provide housing and to stimulate the economy.\nI think we have a good track record in Sutton in supporting high quality development and there are many examples in our borough of developments characterised by good design providing quality housing and infrastructure. That is what we need.”\nThe bench at the junction of The Ridgway and Mayfield Road\nThere are a number of locations in our Ward where there are benches to enable weary pedestrians to put up their feet. At the most recent meeting of the Council’s local committee we got agreement to re-new two benches in the Ward that have deteriorated over time. These are benches in Copse Hill and the one in the photograph, which is at the junction of The Ridgway and Mayfield Road.\nThere is a history to some of the benches in our Ward. In 1988 the South Sutton Neighbourhood Association celebrated the tenth anniversary of its foundation by funding a bench in Cavendish Road close to Ambleside Gardens. The bench was, after over twenty years of use and exposure to the elements, in a very sorry state. We took action to get the bench restored, with the plaque explaining the history of the bench moved to the new bench.\nOn the 27th of January Sutton Council met. Richard raised the issue of the reasons why a recent survey by The Times newspaper ranked Sutton as the eighth most attractive place to live in England. This finding does not surprise us. We spend a lot of time knocking on the doors of our residents to introduce ourselves as your local Councillors and we find people generally say they really like Sutton, mentioning a strong sense of community, open spaces, low crime, good schools, a green and pleasant environment, parks, street trees, being convenient for London and for the countryside. This is particularly the case with people who have moved to Sutton from elsewhere, particularly those from other London boroughs, from Hong Kong and from Ukraine. Please write to us and tell us what you like about Sutton or think we can improve.\nWe are always keen to look at ways of improving our Ward.\nLast year traffic engineers undertook a study of traffic flows in our Ward and the results of the exercise are listed in a later post on this site. The results have not led to some “standout” conclusion as to a problem that needs tackling but traffic officers are examining three main issues:\nwhether action can be taken to improve the safety and the experience of pedestrians crossing the Kings Lane bridge without closing the road to vehicles. The bridge is narrow. Installing a second bridge would be impossibly expensive. Marking a pedestrian path at one side of the road might be feasible. We would welcome the views of users of the bridge, both pedestrians and motorists\nsimilarly, whether something can be done to improve the safety and the experience of pedestrians passing under the railway bridge in Langley Park Road. Some proposals are to be consulted on\npossible improvements to the busy junction where Cedar Road crosses Langley Park Road. Residents have spoken to us of the difficulties pedestrians have in crossing Langley Park Road. Consultation with residents in adjacent streets is underway on proposals to install two new traffic islands in Langley Park Road. These will form a safe area in the middle of the road so the road can be crossed by pedestrians in two phases.\nYour views on these issues, and views on any other traffic and parking issues you would like us to look at would be welcomed.\nThe police met residents of Sutton South Ward again on the evening of 15 January 2025, at Devonshire Avenue school. There are open, public meetings held quarterly at which the police discuss the policing of the Ward with local residents. We were addressed by our Ward Constable, Constable Robyn Skivens, who went through the crime statistics for the Ward. Sutton has a lower crime rate than most outer London boroughs and our Ward has one of the lowest crime rates in Sutton. However, crime always has a significant impact on the victim and public concern remains high. The draft minutes of the meeting are as below.\nSUTTON SOUTH COMMUNITY / POLICE MEETING. 15 JANUARY 2025 Attended by PC Robyn Skivens and PCSO Helen Maguire for the police. A report was given on main crime trends from 1 September to the date of the meeting. DRUG OFFENCES There had been 18 drug offences, mainly possession of drugs, mainly cannabis. While this was higher than normal the increase was partly attributable to a special police operation at Sutton train station. Four of these crimes were the interception by the Border Force of drug shipments. Where such a shipment is to premises in our Ward it will count in our statistics. BURGLARY There had been 21 burglaries or attempted burglaries. This included residential burglaries, burglaries of garages and sheds, and some burglaries of businesses. It was noted that there was usually a seasonal increase in burglary at this time of year as it was darker earlier. There had been eight residential burglaries. However, some that had been reported in sheltered accommodation in the Ward were later disproved and attributed to dementia. A disturbing case was that of a landlord who was able to let himself into a flat and commit theft. Two burglaries of garages had involved theft of bicycles. Mention was made of a shop in Brighton Road where the window was smashed and the wooden panel that was then put in place to secure the premises was pulled away to facilitate burglary. Mention was made of the theft of tools from a construction site in the Ward. Some burglaries had involved the theft of keys, which were then used to commit further offences (theft of a car key leading to theft of a car). The police stressed the need to make sure keys were kept out of sight – if the keys can be seen from your letterbox you are inviting crime.\nVEHICLE CRIME\nThere had been 14 instances of vehicle crime (theft of vehicles, damage to vehicles, theft from vehicles). The police stressed the need to avoid leaving anything of value on display in your car, or in the car at all. An unusual crime had been the theft of an excavator and a dumper from the road works in Brighton Road. THEFT There had been 23 crimes in a category the police described as “theft and kindred (to theft)” events. This included shoplifting, parcel theft, theft of pedal cycles and mobile phones. Examples mentioned included theft of scrap metal, theft of a wheelie bin and theft of a wedding ring by distraction techniques. MAJOR CRIMES There had been nine major, violent crimes in the Ward. This included several robberies at the train station, a large group altercation outside a restaurant, a fight between two drug users, and a concerning incident of a woman who was followed from the station and robbed. There were also two incidents of arson, of a bin and of a Ford transit. A ULEZ camera was deliberately damaged. There was an incident where a drug user was searched and a knife, and bladed articles, were found to be in his possession. There was a disturbing incident of an anti-semitic symbol being daubed on a wall outside the synagogue in Cedar Road. There had been a succession of incidents related to a woman living in Cedar Road who had engaged in anti- social activities that had attracted a community of drug users to her premises. This was now the subject of police reports to the DPS that were expected to lead to her being charged with serious offences. SPEEDING The police had been conducting a programme of visits to local care homes and sheltered housing to talk about scams. Residents had raised with them concerns about speeding in Cavendish Road, which had led to police action in that road. There was a discussion of speeding in local roads including Chalgrove Road, Langley Park Road, The Ridgway and Cavendish Road. The police had been carrying out speed checks in Chalgrove Road and Cavendish Road. The action in Cavendish Road had led to twelve drivers receiving warnings. The police would consider further action against speeding in local roads, subject to resources.\nOTHER MATTERS DISCUSSED Staffing levels: There should be in theory be a third officer on the Ward to support Robyn and Helen, but they were coping. The number of “extractions” when they were called away to join police exercises elsewhere in London, or at the Croydon custody suite, remained an issue of concern but was now running close to 35% of their time rather than the 50% it had once been. Mention was made of local concern about a story that a body had been discovered at a house in Egmont Road. The police assured the meeting that there was no wider implication of this incident. The next meeting was tentatively scheduled for Wednesday 14 May at Devonshire Avenue school (7pm) subject to the police checking their work rota. The meeting thanked Robyn for coming back from leave to attend the meeting and thanked the officers for their work for the community in dealing with crime in the Ward. The meeting thanked Fiona Ostler for letting us meet at the school. The date of the next meeting was provisionally set as Wednesday 14 May, at Devonshire Avenue primary school and thought continues to be given to what could be done to better publicise the meeting and get a better attendance.\nConstable Skivens, Louise, Trish and Richard with other Ward police officers at the Sutton South Hello Christmas party\nThe Phoenix Concert Band – which is based in our Ward and for which Richard plays trumpet – were busy over the Christmas period raising money for the Mayor of Sutton’s charity appeal. The band practices every Friday in the church at Christchurch in Christchurch Park. A concert in the church, staged by the band in December, drew an audience of over a hundred and raised £790 for the charity appeal. The band also played Christmas carols at an event in the Straw cafe in Manor Park in December, which raised £360. On the last Saturday before Christmas the band joined a wider group of musicians to play Christmas carols in the atrium of the St Nicholas shopping centre in Sutton (see photo) which raised £180, so £1330 in all. We were grateful to the Mayor, Councillor Colin Stears, who attended all these events. In addition the band played a concert at the Friends’ Meeting House in Cedar Road on the second Saturday in December, to entertain an enthusiastic audience before the “Second Saturday Tea” which the Quakers provide every month on the second Saturday. The Mayor of Sutton’s charities are Home-Start, Sutton, and Sutton, Kingston and Epsom – Parkinson’s UK. Our contribution to the appeal was dwarfed by the £10 000 prize for second place in the boroughs’ competition won by the Sutton float in the London New Year’s Day parade.\nWe pride ourselves on the fact that we have a network of dedicated volunteers who deliver our “FOCUS” magazine throughout the Ward. If you have the odd half hour a few times a year to support us in this way please contact us. We recently prepared an end of year newsletter to update our volunteer deliverers on our activities. We thought we would share it with those who look at our website.\n“The last year has been our most successful year in Sutton South Ward. With the election of Luke as our Member of Parliament in July we have, for the first time, three Liberal Democrat Councillors representing our Ward and a Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament representing us at Westminster. We held a successful Ward meeting on 28 November where we heard from Luke on the incredibly busy life he now has as our Member of Parliament. He has been meeting all the important community groups in Sutton and Cheam, and has made speeches in Parliament on a variety of issues – ranging from the importance of support for carers to the future of Taiwan. In his maiden speech he spoke about what a pleasant place Sutton is to live, work and raise a family, a great change from the previous MP who spent all his time running Sutton down. He is enthusiastic about his role as spokesperson for London. As Ward Councillors, we have a lot of local casework that we deal with and are doing more than our fair bit as Chairs of Council committees – Trish chairing the Audit and Governance Committee, Richard the Planning Committee and Louise combining being chair of the Licensing Committee with her role as Deputy Mayor. This is her second year as Deputy Mayor following the three years during which Trish was Mayor.\nLike every local authority, Sutton Council is pre-occupied by financial issues and struggling with some difficult decisions to balance the books. The decision to close the Registrar’s office (The Russetings) in Worcester Road was one we regretted, driven by a need to consolidate services in fewer buildings, but we believe planning controls are sufficient to protect the appearance of this attractive, locally listed, building in the street scene.\nWe have secured funding for improvements to the WArd, including new information signs at the only open space in our Ward – the Devonshire Avenue Nature Area (DANA). Maintenance of the nature area involves a balance of ensuring it is a peaceful place for people to visit while preserving the biodiversity of the site. There is now a Friends of DANA group – let us know if you would like to join it. We are already looking forward to our next electoral challenge, to retain control of the Council in 2026. We need to keep up the work of talking to our residents, delivering our literature and doorknocking. Let us know if you are interested in being one of our candidates. We welcome talking or corresponding with you and with all our residents. We hope to have further Ward meetings next year. We are really grateful for the help we get.”\nSutton South Councillors were concerned to learn about changes proposed to the organisation of the Police Cadets, who meet at a school in our ward. Currently there are over 120 cadets. However, the decision has been made to close junior cadets and cut the remaining senior cadets to just 46. Their future programme is also being severely curtailed. This will have a major impact on the youth of this borough who will no longer have the opportunity to participate in activities such as camps, parades and Duke of Edinburgh awards.\nCouncillor Louise Phelan, whose son has been a Cadet, commented “I’ve seen first-hand the benefits of being part of police cadets. They learn valuable life skills, and gain self confidence. They also support the local community and get to take part in things they wouldn’t otherwise have had the opportunity to do. For many this is a stepping stone into a career within the police force, for others the Cadets help to keep them on the right path and make better life decisions. I am incredibly concerned others will now not get these opportunities.”",

We have been awarded £740,000 for this scheme in the 2013/14 financial year.\nRichard says “We have made this a major campaign since we were elected. Initial setbacks, such as the rejection of a bid by the Mayor under the Outer London Fund Scheme, have not deterred us. If this now goes ahead it will be good news for the residents of Sutton South Ward, particularly who commute from Sutton station, giving easier access to the station and an improved frontage in The Quadrant.”\nSutton station is the 5th busiest in South London, and the 27th busiest in the whole of Greater London, with almost 6 million passenger movements every year. It is one of 18 stations in London identified by TfL as suffering significant congestion problems.\nThe main elements in the scheme not only include opening the side entrance but extensive landscaping to improve the appearance of what will in effect be a new entrance from The Quadrant. The main elements include:\n* Opening up the side entrance to the station to improve station access and egress, improve the streetscape and improve pedestrian access to the station\n* Public realm and footway improvements in The Quadrant and at the front of the station\n* Bus stop improvements at the front of the station to improve passenger experience\n* “De-cluttering” and harmonisation of street furniture and materials\n* Junction and crossing improvements on walking routes to the station\n* Road safety improvements\n* Additional cycle parking and cycle lanes, and\n* Improved street lighting.\nBenefits of the scheme will include reduced pedestrian journey times between the station and The Quadrant, the station car park and the Langley Park Road area, as well as reduced congestion within the station main entrance and at the barriers.\nOpening the side entrance at Sutton Station will cater for the considerable demand for direct access to the station from the Quadrant House office block, which houses Reed Business Information (with approximately 2,000 employees, about one third of whom travel to work by train) and a number of other expanding companies, together with the Tudor Court office block, which houses Synergy UK. The new entrance will also serve the large station car park (which Network Rail wish to expand), and the motorcycle and cycle parking areas, which generate considerable demand for access from that side of the station. There is also direct footpath access between The Quadrant and Langley Park Road and surrounding residential streets, well-used by rail passengers. These station users currently have to walk around the side to the front of the station on a convoluted route and negotiate busy footways, bus stops and the station entrance. Most of these passengers are likely to have season tickets, and opening up the side entrance will significantly reduce their journey times and congestion outside and in the entrance hall of the main station entrance.\nWhile the Council has been lobbying for the opening up of the side entrance since the entrance was created with a retractable shutter ten years ago, the campaign took on new impetus when Richard and Heather were elected in 2010. The entrance is opened up when rail replacement buses are used during engineering work, as the buses stop in The Quadrant. This demonstrates that it is possible to open and use the entrance. Southern has supported the opening in principle, subject to funding being available to provide the barriers etc. Network Rail has also supported the scheme in principle and has assisted with business case work.\nWe will keep readers advised of further progress in the negotiations that are now underway. At the Council meeting on 14 January Richard sought re-assurance that elements such as lighting in the Quadrant and cycle parking will not be lost.",

  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_category_news_page_23/content_796.html": "Homeland Drive, Belmont\nIn earlier posts on this site we have set out our concerns about the proposed closure of the Grove Road and Belmont surgeries, used by many residents of our Ward, and opening of a replacement surgery in a building in Homeland Drive, in Belmont. This is of particular concern due to the high proportion of over 75s in our Ward (a higher percentage than for any other Ward in Sutton) and the lack of any GP surgery in the Ward. There is a problem of access to the site, which is poorly served by public transport.\nAt the Council’s Strategy and Resources Committee on 11 February and at the Council meeting on 3 March Richard and Heather repeated their opposition to the proposal and pressed for improvements to the proposed community transport scheme. This would go some way to ameliorating our concerns.\nIn speeches to Council on 3 March both Richard and Heather expressed concern that the doctors did not seem interested in proposals from Ruth Dombey, our Council leader, to help find a better alternative site.\nWe are writing to NHS England and continuing our campaign within the decision-taking structures of the NHS. Here is the text of Richard’s speech to Council on 3 March summarising our position.\n“Councillor Honour and I, as Councillors for Sutton South Ward, have consistently opposed the move of the two surgeries to the Henderson hospital site. Our Ward has the highest proportion of elderly residents of any Ward in Sutton and there are many residents of our Ward who go to the Grove Road or Belmont surgeries. Our objection to the site is that it is not sufficiently accessible by public transport. What has been offered by way of a community transport service, to deal with this problem, is a help but does not resolve the problem.\nThis motion applauds the efforts made by Councillor Dombey to resolve this issue, and I would like to warmly support that sentiment.\nThis is a decision taken by local doctors who work within the National Health Service. I understand from the evidence that NHS England gave to the Council’s Scrutiny Committee last year that the doctors have to put their case for the move to NHS England. Councillor Honour and I have written to NHS England to remind them of their responsibilities in this matter and ask them not to endorse this decision.\nThe local authority has come into this by the back door in three ways. First, as local planning authority, because the doctors need planning permission for the building. I sat through the discussion at the Development Control Committee and respect the fact that the Committee concluded ultimately that there were insufficient planning grounds to turn down the application. Its decisions are subject to appeal to the Planning Inspectorate so it cannot capriciously ignore the published planning policies. Second, I understand that the authority is a joint owner of the site but legal advice is that the Council would be in breach of contract were it not to proceed to completion of the sale – if the decision is taken, by the doctors and the NHS, to go ahead with this move. Third, the offer of Councillor Dombey to act as a mediator. I still hope that will be taken up.\nSo the spotlight has to focus on the decision-taking processes in the NHS.\nCouncillor Honour and I have written to NHS England to remind them of their responsibilities in this matter and urge them consider alternatives to this decision.”\nHere is the text of our letter to NHS England.\n“Unsuitable Location for Proposed GP Surgery in Sutton\nAs Councillors for Sutton South Ward in the London Borough of Sutton we are deeply concerned at proposals to close two GP surgeries and replace them with a new medical surgery at a site unsuitable for many of our residents.\nThere is at present no GP surgery in our Ward, which has the highest proportion of residents aged over 70 of any Ward in the Borough of Sutton. Our residents use a number of local surgeries but many go to the surgery at Grove Road in the centre of Sutton and to the Belmont surgery, close to Belmont railway station. These are to close, under the proposals.\nThe proposed new medical centre is in Homeland Drive, at the site of the former Henderson hospital. However, the site is not sufficiently accessible for the elderly and those without a car. It is rated PTAL 1b, which means that it is not accessible to public transport. It is in fact at least 300 metres up a steepish inclined road that is dark and uninviting. Our GPs state that 75% of patients will use a car. The remainder are likely to be elderly, unable to drive a car, or on a low income. They also are likely to be amongst the most frequent patients at the surgery.\nThere are severe limitations on the use of dial-a-ride and taxicard, so use of these services is not an option for people who find it difficult to access public transport and this site.\nThe statistics on the population of the Ward illustrate the problem. Sutton South has much more sheltered housing, and more care homes than other parts of the Borough. 2.94% of Ward residents live in managed residential accommodation compared to a Borough average of 0.78%. Over 75 per cent of properties in Sutton South are flats, many of them single occupancy. 46.3% of households in Sutton South are single person households, with 15.5% occupied by people over 65.

This means that they would not have people to assist them with transport.\nWe therefore consider that the proposed site for the new GP surgeries does not meet the needs of the most vulnerable in our Ward and we would prefer a more accessible site.\nFrom the information that we have received it does not appear that the GPs have considered the transport needs of their elderly patients, a growing demographic, who will need to use the surgery often, possibly as much as once a week for visits to the other services at the centre as well as their GPs. Many have said to us that they will need to change their doctor if this goes ahead.\nIn response to our concerns the developer of the site, Assura, has offered a community transport scheme. However, after close examination of this, it does not appear to be a practicable solution.\nOnce again the NHS, which declares that it is patient centred, is failing its patients by not taking account of their transport needs. This has been a major local issue in the abortive Better Services Better Value plans to change the status of our local hospital, St Helier.\nIt is by no means clear to us what the process is in the NHS to take a wider view of the optimum location of GP surgeries in the interests of the patients. However, we understand from evidence that NHS England gave to Sutton Council’s Scrutiny Committee last year that NHS England have a role. We would therefore like to meet you to discuss how you conside that these proposals meet the needs of our most vulnerable residents and your most needy patients.\nYours sincerely.\nRICHARD CLIFTON\nHEATHER HONOUR”",

Protection of children from harm\n3. Public safety\n4. Prevention of public nuisance.\nThe committee was shown video evidence indicating breaches of the licence conditions, with trading outside the permitted hours, smoking in the bar, and noise problems.\nThe decision of the owner to appeal means that, in normal circumstances, the bar could continue to operate until the appeal is determined.

The current restrictions mean it may be a while before the appeal is determined.\nThe premises are up for sale and it is believed that there is a buyer keen to take over the bar. The buyer would, unless the appeal succeeds, have to apply for a new licence and convince the Licensing Committee that the premises will be better managed in future.\nIt is understood that the Spagetti Tree restaurant, near the bar, is taking over the vacant unit next to it (also an Italian restaurant until it closed recently).

  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_category_news_page_22/content_789.html": "With Mary Burstow and the bench we donated to Richard Sharples Court\nA REPORT ON MY FOUR YEARS AS A COUNCILLOR – By Richard\nThe work of a Councillor comprises the work you do for Sutton as a whole on Sutton Council and specific work for residents of the Ward.\nI have been the Vice-Chair of the Housing, Economy and Business Committee and “lead Councillor” on trading standards and on revenues and benefits. The two most challenging pieces of work I did were the re-design of the Council tax support scheme and the re-design of the Council’s committee system.\nThe Government “localised” Council tax support (the system of support payments to the most needy) by axing the national scheme. It invited local authorities to set up their own scheme but passed down to Councils only some of the funding. This cost Sutton £1.1 million. The challenge was to devise a local scheme which, while inevitably less generous, protected the vulnerable. The scheme I devised, which was ultimately accepted, provided support to those in most need and protected from cuts in benefit the elderly, the disabled, lone parents and families with small children. There were difficult choices and it was one of the most difficult projects I have undertaken in 40 years work in public administration.\nThe revision of the Council’s committee system I worked on was designed to take advantage of provisions in the Localism Act that made it possible to move from an “Executive” system to a “subject committee” system I considered more democratic. I led the group considering options and developed a scheme that was the basis for the system Sutton now has adopted.\nI also did a lot of work on a scrutiny of the Council’s policies on homelessness. This issue concerned me as I felt that some of the policies being recommended to us by Conservative Councillors would have increased homelessness, and the scrutiny activity demonstrated this.\nI have also been a member of the Audit Committee, the Scrutiny Committee, the Standards Committee, the Development Control Committee and the representative of Sutton on numerous external bodies and boards, such as the Downland Project (which organises volunteers to, for example, clear scrubland in local woods).\nWhen I was elected I obtained an exercise book (I do not trust computerised systems) and wrote on the cover “Casework.” Item number one was an issue raised by a resident of Copse Hill about a tree in the road demolished by a car. I got it replaced. My most recent entry in the Casework book (a disputed parking ticket I got rescinded) is item number 413, but this does not quite do me justice as some of these entries are multiple issues and some issues I was able to resolve almost immediately without resort to the “Casework” book.\nThere are some issues affecting the Ward as a whole that I have worked on that give me particular satisfaction – including the extension of the “no drinking zone” (controlling the drinking of alcohol in a public place) from the town centre to cover most of the Ward, the improvements to the Devonshire Avenue Nature Area while retaining its central purpose as a nature reserve, the safety improvements to the Grange Vale bridge, opening the side entrance to Sutton station (work now underway), getting more trees planted, helping found the Sutton South Hello! Project to tackle social isolation, getting funding for measures to combat speeding in Cavendish Road and Cedar Road, and securing 780 local jobs through the Subsea7 project (jobs are gold dust). The regular surgeries we have held have convinced me that there is a real issue for people in their 50s made redundant from work in getting back into the labour market, and the really big difference you can make to an area is ensuring there are local jobs. There are very few Councillors in Britain who can claim they have been instrumental in getting so many jobs for their area, given the massive competition between local authorities for such job-creating inward investment.\nThere were also many things I did for individual residents. Some of these projects gave me great satisfaction – such as getting a disabled parking bay moved so that it was not under a tree and thus the disabled resident did not get her car covered, every day, with droppings. For another resident, I got her over £2 000 in a compensation payment through pursuing her case. Some of the issues I dealt with, particularly those involving anti-social behaviour, were difficult and sometimes harrowing.\nThe background I brought to my period as a Councillor was that I am a retired civil servant who was, at one time, Chair of the Board of a European Agency (the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, based in Bilbao, Spain) and at another time Chair of the Channel Tunnel Safety Authority. After a long career in public service at a European and national level it was a priviledge and a pleasure to use the skills I had obtained, in the service of my immediate, local community. My wife Gloria and I have lived in our Ward for 26 years and both our daughters went to local State schools. I like Sutton, which has a pleasant suburban atmosphere, low crime, good schools, affordable housing and low unemployment. I have been motivated by a desire to play my part in keeping its many benefits. And the values I bring to being a Councillor are those of a concern to use the skills I have acquired in life to benefit the disadvantaged in society – in society as a whole and, in my work these past four years, in the immediate community around me. And I have still managed to find time to play the trumpet in a Sutton-based concert band, playing last year in a concert at Christchurch for the 125th. anniversary of the church, and playing Christmas carols at the Friends’ Meeting House for the past two years.\nThere has been hardly a day in the last four years when I have not been engaged on some activity on behalf of the residents of Sutton.\nRICHARD CLIFTON",

Several organisations in the Ward have indicated an interest in preparing a Neighbourhood Plan, but none has made a specific proposal so far.\nRichard said “I am an enthusiast for Neighbourhood Plans as any process that brings the community together to discuss such plans for their locality is an integrating process promoting social cohesion, which I applaud. But I think such plans should be ambitious in their scope rather than looking narrowly at the design of buildings. The impetus for such plans must come from the community, so the role of the Council should be largely advisory (in particular advising on the definition of a neighbourhood, how to ensure a neighbourhood forum is representative and how bodies can ensure draft plans are consistent with broader planning strategy), and undertaking certain statutory functions (arranging independent review of any plan and a referendum on the plan).\nThe Council should give a basic level of support to all bodies preparing plans – including signposting to sources of advice and application arrangements – and additional support for the process in areas where there is more scope for development, where plans will help meet other Council objectives such as tackling social isolation and social exclusion, and where there is deprivation.\nNeighbourhood plans could be an important step to promoting social cohesion, motivating the local community, spreading good practice on tackling loneliness and tackling social isolation, by community action. This has happened in Hackbridge, with their plan, and is happening in the village in Oxfordshire where my brother is leading the development of the village Neighbourhood Plan.”",
  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_category_planning_page_3/content_41.html": "At last some positive news on what is happening to Sutherland House, the empty building just south of the railway station in Brighton Road on the corner with Cedar Road.\nThis building has been empty far too long but we now have confirmation from the owners, Criterion Capital, that the work is well under way to renovate the building. The renovation will convert the building to 128 luxury flats with car parking spaces, one per flat.\nThey expect the work to be finished by March 2016. They will be appointing local estate agents to act for them to offer the flats for rent. We are a little surprised that they are to be offered for rent rather than sale, but given the location close to the station there will be no shortage of demand. We doubt if they will be actively marketing the flats until the work is sufficiently progressed for them to have a show flat for people to look at, but they say the work will be to a high standard.\nWe have been critical of the developers as they used a route to bypass normal planning permission requirements, but at last work is under way and we have a date by which the building will be occupied. The year 2016 will be a good one for the area with the occupation of the Subsea7 building and Sutherland House, bringing people into the area who will spend money in local shops and restaurants, which will give the whole area an uplift.\nThe argument over the future of Sutherland House was the subject of a letter from Richard published by The Guardian (the national paper, not the Sutton Guardian) on 5 February. Here is the text:\n“Sir\nCongratulations to The Guardian for exposing the loss of affordable housing that has resulted from the Government’s successive changes to planning law.\nThe latest changes are in a series that have progressively created major loopholes to excuse developers from providing affordable housing. Just south of Sutton station, in south London, there is an office building, empty for some years, which the developers propose to convert to 128 luxury flats. The day before Sutton Council’s Planning Committee was to approve the scheme, which included a significant number of affordable homes, the developers withdrew the scheme. They had spotted the advantages to them if they followed a newly-created route called “prior approval” that has now forced the Council to accept the application with zero affordable homes included.\nOn one calculation, our Borough may have lost up to 500 affordable homes due to that legislation. The latest changes you highlight are further steps on a path that is seriously undermining the efforts of local authorities to help those in dire need of better housing.\nCouncillor Richard Clifton, Chair of Planning Committee, London Borough of Sutton”\nAt the meeting of Sutton Council on 19 January Richard criticised the owners of Sutherland House for their “inertia” in relation to the re-development of the empty building.\nRichard joined with Sutton Councillor Hanna Zuchowska in pointing out that the owners withdrew an application for planning permission that included an element of affordable housing before exploiting recent changes in planning law to get permission for conversion of the building to 128 luxury flats with no affordable housing element. But still, although the building has been empty for five years, they do not get on with the re-development.\nSpeaking after the meeting Richard said “The building is still empty and a blot on the landscape. The development of the Subsea7 building, bringing 800 office jobs to the area, and the improvements associated with the Sutton Gateway project, are giving a lift to the area just south of Sutton station. We need the developers to get on with the renovation of Sutherland House.”\nThe full text of Richard’s speech, seconding a motion on affordable housing, is as follows:\n“In seconding this motion, I would like to draw attention to the opening sentence, which speaks of the widening gap between the rich and the poor.\nI find it astonishing that in my own lifetime the wealth gap between rich and poor has not just failed to diminish but has actually widened.\nThe figures are so astounding one hardly believes them – that the top 80 (eight zero) wealthiest individuals in the world own more than half the world’s wealth, that is they own as much as half the population of the planet.\nAnd in our own country about 30 billionaires own half the wealth of the nation.\nAnd the implications of this inequality are not just a matter of concern for social policy.\nA fascinating study published by the OECD last December showed that countries with a smaller and narrowing gap between rich and poor experienced higher rates of economic growth, and if the gap between rich and poor had not widened in Britain from the 1980’s the UK economy would in fact be 20% larger.\nGeorge Osborne ought to reflect on the reasons for this. If you increase the earnings of the poor they will spend it, creating income, jobs and wealth for others, but if you increase the earnings of the rich they may save much of it. He ought to remember this when he plans yet further raids on the welfare budget, on financial support to the very poorest in society, rather than asking the wealthy to contribute more.\nIt is a finding that demonstrates that the so-called “trickledown” economics so beloved of leaders on the right of the political spectrum – and that included Margaret Thatcher – whereby largesse afforded to the very rich trickled down to help the very poor, was in fact a recipe for lower growth and thus a lower increase in living standards for all.\nWe need concerted policy action to deal with this, and tax rates on the highest earners, property taxes, the minimum wage, and welfare support to the very poor, are all important aspects. But we all know that action and support for those in need can be best targeted if undertaken at a local level.\nHere in Sutton, we will continue to do what we can to build a fairer and more equal society, something of particular importance to us as Liberal Democrats, even if what we can do is sometimes at the most basic level, such as dealing with concerns about food and housing.\nAnd the fact that we have Food Banks, here in Britain, in one of the more affluent countries in the world, makes my point about inequality more eloquently than any of my words can do.\nOn housing, we can be proud of our record in Sutton.\nAs Councillor McCoy told us, the Council is promoting affordable housing, something that is vital when I find that in my own Ward changes to planning law mean that a block like Sutherland House can become 128 luxury flats with no affordable housing requirement atall. If and when the developers finally get on with it, and I deplore their inertia.\nAnd the Council is dealing with homelessness: I was heartened by the serious and concerned tone of the debate at Planning Committee on the proposal to provide short-term accommodation for homeless families in Benhill Road. It was the Committee at its best. This was on an evening – 17 December 2014 – when no less than 76 (seven six) Sutton families were homeless and in bed and breakfast accommodation, often miles from Sutton.\nMr. Mayor, we must continue our efforts as a Council to care for the most needy of our residents, while having a concern – as citizens – to promote policies, at every level, that will increase economic growth but distribute the rewards more fairly.\nI am pleased to second the motion.”",
  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_2013_04_29_3042/content_745.html": "The latest proposals for redevelopment of Sutherland House go to the Development Control Committee on Wednesday 8 May. Richard and Heather support the recommendation of the Council’s Planning Department to oppose the proposals.\nWe want to see Sutherland House re-developed, but not at any price. What is most objectionable is the lack of inclusion of affordable housing, despite evidence to be presented to the Committee that massive profits will be made by the developers and that they could afford to make such a contribution to the local community. There will be 160 private, luxury flats in the development. Richard and Heather, in their casework, meet local families with small children living in horribly over-crowded conditions. These developers can afford to do more for the community! An independent assessment of their proposals shows that the profits they will make are £3.67million beyond what would be “normal” profits.\nThe proposal will go to the Planning Inspectorate who will, we hope, insist of some provision of affordable housing, something that would be normal in such a big housing development. The reasons given for opposing the current proposal are, in full:\n| The proposal does not include any affordable housing which would cause harm to the promotion of mixed and balanced communities and would fail to contribute towards addressing the lack of affordable houses in Sutton and London in general. In addition, the lack of employment generating uses proposed would undermine the policies that underpin the future economic growth of Sutton and would fail to promote the vitality and viability of the Town Centre. Having independently reviewed the applicant’s viability assessment submitted with the application the Councils independent experts disagree with some of the assumptions that underpin the applicant’s figures. The Council’s independent consultant considers the scheme has a surplus of £2.9m in addition to the £670,000 the appellant allows for S106 payments and the developers profit, whilst still providing a viable scheme. This means that approximately £3.67m could be spent on providing affordable housing, planning contributions and/or employment uses along with a CIL payment of approximately £40,000. | |||\n• The over-concentration of restaurant uses proposed at ground floor level is considered unacceptable and would mean the over-supply of food and drink uses, which would limit the range, choice and interest of uses in this parade.\n|",

We were very impressed by the school, which is already vastly over-subscribed. We recollect the fuss and opposition when building a school on this site was first proposed. Quite a few of our residents in Sutton South Ward now have children at this school. ~It was opened by the broadcaster Jim Al-Khalili.\nSORTING OUT THE STATION\nThe work involved in repairing a major electricity cable has caused real problems outside Sutton station and the closure of a bus stop. Trish and Richard had to intervene when the pavement was shut and no walkway established, so people were walking in the road. Eventually we got a walkway put in.\nOUR COMMITMENT TO FIGHT HATE CRIME\nHate Crime Week was 14 to 18 October. There were events in Sutton and nationally. It was an opportunity for all of us to commit again to fighting this great evil of modern life.\nIMPROVING TRANSPORT AND PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT\nWe remain committed to delivering an e-bike scheme in Sutton.\nThe Council has been partnering with Lime on a 12 months trial for a dockless e-bike scheme. Sadly this scheme has now foundered as Lime have withdrawn – we guess it did not prove profitable.

When Richard reported this graffiti in Cedar Road at the foot of Northumberland House it was removed in a few days. Graffiti and fly tipping are a scourge. Report to us any instances you see.\nTHE COUNCIL’S CONSULTATION ON PARKING\nWHAT HAS HAPPENED SO FAR\nThe Council decided that, as parking is often raised as a problem in the regular surveys of the views of residents on what they like about living in Sutton, it would ask all Sutton residents if parking was a problem in their road and what they would like done. The first round of consultation led to the traffic engineers proposing a parking control scheme in just three roads in this area – Chalgrove Road, The Ridgway and Mayfield Road. As there seemed to be no appetite for the full CPZ with machines, as in Langley Park Road, what was proposed was yellow lines operable for one hour a day to remove commuters and “long stay” parkers. There would also need to be bays where people could park at any time, to cater for those residents who have insufficient drive space and need to park a car on the street all day during the day. This is the scheme in Hillcroome Road.\nThese proposals were not given sufficient support by residents for the Council to have a mandate to proceed with them. Majority opinion in Chalgrove Road was against and, with about a third of residents responding, there was a roughly equal split of opinion in The Ridgway and in Mayfield, small majorities for in Mayfield and against in The Ridgway. The Council would only want to proceed with such a scheme if there was clear and strong resident support. Paradoxically, residents in Upland Road were keen to be included in any parking scheme for The Ridgway and Mayfield.\nWHAT HAPPENS NOW\nResponses to consultation suggested that a major problem with the proposals was the free bays, which were seen as a magnet for commuters and long stay parkers, squeezing out residents. The alternative to schemes that all have this disadvantage is a residents-only Permit Parking Area.\nThe way this works is that only residents can park their vehicles in the road for a “control period”, usually one or two hours each day on weekdays, thus removing commuters and long stay parkers. However, residents would need to obtain and display a parking permit on any vehicle they want to park in the road during the “control period”, and obtain “visitors’ permits” for their visitors. As this scheme will involve the costs of administration and enforcement, and it is only fair that these are borne by those who benefit from the scheme, there is a cost for a permit. The charges would be designed just to cover costs and policy is that they will not increase in the future by more than the index of prices. The cost of a first permit in the current CPZ area is £40 which contrasts with £90 in both Kingston and Merton, £99 in Richmond, £80 in Croydon. Studies consistently show that Sutton is one of the cheapest places in London to Park.\nThe Council will consult residents on this proposal. Some residents will not see this as a price worth paying to remove non-resident parking and will not support the scheme. That is understandable – we are not making any recommendation but just want to see if residents would or would not support such a parking control scheme.\nIn Sutton South Ward, the Council will consult residents in Chalgrove Road, The Ridgway, Mayfield Road, Farm Road, Upland Road, Kayemoor Road, Farm Close, Willis Avenue and Prior Avenue, in September, on whether residents want this scheme in their road. The proposed Permit Parking Area also extends into Belmont Ward, to Egmont Road.\nFor Willis Avenue, Prior Avenue, Kayemoor Road, Downside Road and Farm Close – the results of earlier consultation did not suggest a strong push for parking controls in these road, but residents are still being asked their view on whether they would now favour your road being included in any Permit Parking Area. There was a lower rate of response from these roads, perhaps because the Stage 1 proposals for parking controls in The Ridgway and Mayfield Road were thought to have limited implications. The displacement of parking, particularly if the Permit Parking Area extends to Upland Road, and the fact that numbers of vehicles parked is continuing to gradually increase, could have an impact in the medium to long term, also noting current housing developments in central Sutton. So the Council is again taking the views of residents of these roads.\nWe are not making any recommendation – as local Councillors we simply want to do what a majority of our residents want. We hope residents will respond to the consultation, in September, so we have a full picture.\nThere is an event to explain the proposals at Sutton library on 27 June.\nNEW CROSSING IN MULGRAVE ROAD\nThe new pedestrian crossing in Mulgrave Road is a few yards outside our Ward but it will be of great benefit to our residents. Richard and Trish campaigned for this crossing. Crossing the road has never been easy at this point but the crossing will be of great importance and help.\nFURTHER RESULTS ON PARKING ISSUES IN THE WARD\nTHE ARTICLE BELOW WAS PUBLISHED IN MAY 2019 – THERE ARE FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS SO SEE THE LATER ARTICLE ABOVE. THIS ARTICLE IS KEPT ON THE SITE TO SHOW HOW THE PROPOSALS EVOLVED.\nSutton South Councillors have now seen the results of the second stage of\nthe consultation on parking. There was a strong response rate – about half of\nresidents responding in some roads, high for this type of study. The results\nare clear enough for conclusions to be drawn, but raise some issues on which\nsome more detailed information would be helpful.\nThe results for Mayfield, The Ridgway and Chalgrove indicate that residents\nare not happy with the proposals for yellow lines and bays, so might prefer a\nresidents’ permit parking area. Upland Road residents want to join in any scheme for this area, which makes it logical to also include Farm Road. There is concern about the form of the controls, the proposal being for yellow lines where parking is prohibited for a set period on weekdays, and bays where anyone can park. This could lead to competition between residents and commuters for the bays, the bays attracting “longstay” parkers and commuters touring the area looking for bays. The alternative is a Residents’ Parking Area with no yellow lines or bays, but only residents who have obtained a parking permit, or their visitors displaying a Visitors’ Permit, allowed to park in the street for this set period. This would remove commuters, increase the parking available to residents and eliminate the disadvantages described above, though there would be a charge for the permits to cover the administrative costs of the scheme. We\nwould like your views on these options.\nThere was a lower rate of response from Kayemoor Road, Prior Avenue, Willis Avenue, perhaps because the Stage1 proposals for parking controls in The Ridgway and Mayfield Road were thought to have limited implications. We think the displacement of parking, and the fact that numbers of vehicles parked is continuing to gradually increase, could have an impact in the medium to long term, particularly given current housing developments in central Sutton, So there is a case for further consulting residents of these roads, now that the parking control area will be extended to include Upland Road.\nThere will be further consultation.\nCONCERN CONTINUES OVER POLICE NUMBERS IN SUTTON SOUTH WARD AFTER MERGER WITH BROMLEY AND CROYDON\nOn 8 March we attended a meeting of the Police Consultative panel for the Ward. We continue to have no dedicated Ward office above the level of PCSO. Two police attended – our loyal PCSO Laura Jogoe and PC Adam Nawol, from Cheam Ward, also came.\nAs usual, the police SNTs are seriously undermanned. Over the 4 wards, ie Sutton South, Cheam, Belmont and Sutton West, there are 1 sergeant, 5 PCs, of whom only 3 are “operational” and 3 PCSOs. There are supposed to be 8 PCs, 2 per ward. We were told that there is a PCSO recruitment campaign. Great concern was expressed by all at the meeting and we agreed to write to MPs and the Mayor of London.The police reported that in the period December to March, there were 16 burglaries and 21 vehicle crimes in Sutton South Ward. Common methods of entry included getting over a back gate and entering from the rear of the premises by breaking a door or window. We were advised to link a burglar alarm to a call centre, rather than rely on a neighbour. Car thefts were mainly opportunist, some people forgetting to lock their cars. Drugs were not viewed as a big problem, incidents being very sporadic and tackled quickly, after which the drug sellers would move on to somewhere else.\nWHERE WE ARE ON PARKING\nTHIS ARTICLE WAS PUBLISHED IN FEBRUARY 2019. THERE ARE LATER DEVELOPMENTS COVERED IN LATER ARTICLES, ABOVE. THIS ARTICLE IS KEPT ON THE SITE TO SHOW HOW THE PROPOSALS EVOLVED.\nWe would like to again thank residents who have contributed to the two stages of consultation by the Council on parking.\nSince some misinformation has been put round in the Ward, we want to summarise where matters now stand – though all the information on the process is on the Council’s website, click on parking and follow the links to the parking strategy.\nNo decisions have been taken. We await the analysis by the traffic engineers of the results of the second consultation. As Councillors, we only want to do what residents want. We will be guided by the results of consultation and are determined not to impose our own views on this process.\nWhat we know from the first consultation is this. Much of Sutton South Ward experiences a high demand for parking as we are close to the town centre and the railway station. Parking is rationed by having a controlled parking zone (CPZ) but this leads to bumper to bumper parking six days a week in the roads just outside the zone, such as Mayfield Road. The results of the first round of consultation were consistent with previous studies by Councillors, the Council and the residents’ association, in that:\n- there is a strong majority favouring parking controls in Mayfield Road\n- there are more mixed views in Chalgrove Road and The Ridgway but, overall, support for controls\n- there are more mixed views in Upland Road and roads beyond, though less support for parking controls the further you are from the CPZ.\nThe proposals of officers was to introduce controls in Mayfield, The Ridgway and Chalgrove. It will be interesting to see whether the results of the second consultation mean that other roads, in particular Upland Road, want to join the scheme. The objective of having successive consultations was to let residents have a second opportunity to give a view when they could see what was proposed for neighbouring roads, recognising that any parking scheme will lead to some displacement.\nPrevious surveys have suggested that there is no appetite for a full CPZ with machines. The solution adopted with success elsewhere in Sutton, including in Hillcroome Road, is to have a mix of yellow lines operative for an hour a day to deter commuters, with some free to park bays. These bays are needed to cater for residents who will need to park a vehicle on the road and they also reduce the amount of displacement into neighbouring roads, which is a legitimate consideration.\nAn alternative that has been suggested is to have a “residents’ only” parking scheme with residents obtaining a permit to park during controlled hours. Disadvantages are that this scheme would involve extensive signage along the roads involved, bureaucracy, and a cost as the administrative costs of dealing with permit applications would have to be covered by charges for permits. It would also lead to more displacement. We welcome views on that alternative.\nParking has been an issue of concern locally for the 30 years Richard has lived in The Ridgway. We want to tackle this issue though recognising that it is problematic. We are consulting and will do what the majority of residents want, not impose our own solutions.",
  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_page_5/content_231.html": "There are two proposals for tower blocks in Brighton Road, almost opposite each other, submitted by developers, that Trish and Richard are fighting. One is on the eastern side of the road close to Cavendish Road. This proposal for a five storey block with 36 flats but only four parking spaces has been rejected by Sutton Council planning officers on a number of grounds including design. Richard said of both proposals:\n“While we need more accommodation these blocks, with little adjacent green space, are of poor design and would be blots on the landscape.”\nThe other proposal is almost opposite at the junction with Copse Hill. Developers have twice submitted proposals for this new tower block at the corner of Copse Hill, to be built after demolishing 2 and 4 Copse Hill, plus 52 and 54 Brighton Road. While housing is needed, we have also opposed this development as – unlike Dunsfold Court and Leith Towers nearby – it would have little green space around the site, and the parking provision proposed was inadequate, adding to parking pressures in the area. The block would be ugly, overbearing and a blot on the landscape.\nThese proposals were rejected by Sutton Council and the developers appealed to the remote Planning Inspectorate in Bristol, thus seeking to overturn democratic local decision taking. We are delighted that the Inspectorate has twice thrown out the proposals. They cite concerns over the overbearing character and appearance of the proposed block, a lack of outdoor amenity space (play areas and garden) and the mix of housing proposed (the number of small one bedroom flats). The Inspectorate rejected concerns about flooding and did not comment on our concerns over parking.\nThis may not be the end of the story so we will watch out for further proposals. Radical changes to planning arrangements were proposed in the recent White Paper on planning from the Conservative Government, proposals that in some areas would abolish these arrangements for comment on planning applications and lead to proposals being automatically agreed. Pressure from the Liberal Democrats, and our victory in the Chesham and Amersham by-election, where planning changes was an issue, seems to be forcing a re-think, but these proposals are still, as of now, Government policy. These Government proposals would remove the right of local residents to comment on planning applications, in some circumstances. Richard made a speech at Sutton Council on 12 July attacking these proposals, which undermine local democracy.",

Richard raised the issue of the reasons why a recent survey by The Times newspaper ranked Sutton as the eighth most attractive place to live in England. This finding does not surprise us. We spend a lot of time knocking on the doors of our residents to introduce ourselves as your local Councillors and we find people generally say they really like Sutton, mentioning a strong sense of community, open spaces, low crime, good schools, a green and pleasant environment, parks, street trees, being convenient for London and for the countryside. This is particularly the case with people who have moved to Sutton from elsewhere, particularly those from other London boroughs, from Hong Kong and from Ukraine. Please write to us and tell us what you like about Sutton or think we can improve.\nIMPROVING PEDESTRIAN SAFETY IN OUR WARD\nWe are always keen to look at ways of improving our Ward.\nLast year traffic engineers undertook a study of traffic flows in our Ward and the results of the exercise are listed in a later post on this site. The results have not led to some “standout” conclusion as to a problem that needs tackling but traffic officers are examining three main issues:\n- whether action can be taken to improve the safety and the experience of pedestrians crossing the Kings Lane bridge without closing the road to vehicles. The bridge is narrow. Installing a second bridge would be impossibly expensive. Marking a pedestrian path at one side of the road might be feasible. We would welcome the views of users of the bridge, both pedestrians and motorists\n- similarly, whether something can be done to improve the safety and the experience of pedestrians passing under the railway bridge in Langley Park Road. Some proposals are to be consulted on\n- possible improvements to the busy junction where Cedar Road crosses Langley Park Road. Residents have spoken to us of the difficulties pedestrians have in crossing Langley Park Road. Consultation with residents in adjacent streets is underway on proposals to install two new traffic islands in Langley Park Road. These will form a safe area in the middle of the road so the road can be crossed by pedestrians in two phases.\nYour views on these issues, and views on any other traffic and parking issues you would like us to look at would be welcomed.\nFURTHER OPEN, QUARTERLY MEETING OF LOCAL RESIDENTS AND THE POLICE\nThe police met residents of Sutton South Ward again on the evening of 15 January 2025, at Devonshire Avenue school. There are open, public meetings held quarterly at which the police discuss the policing of the Ward with local residents. We were addressed by our Ward Constable, Constable Robyn Skivens, who went through the crime statistics for the Ward. Sutton has a lower crime rate than most outer London boroughs and our Ward has one of the lowest crime rates in Sutton. However, crime always has a significant impact on the victim and public concern remains high. The draft minutes of the meeting are as below.\nSUTTON SOUTH COMMUNITY / POLICE MEETING. 15 JANUARY 2025\nAttended by PC Robyn Skivens and PCSO Helen Maguire for the police.\nA report was given on main crime trends from 1 September to the date of the\nmeeting.\nDRUG OFFENCES\nThere had been 18 drug offences, mainly possession of drugs, mainly cannabis.\nWhile this was higher than normal the increase was partly attributable to a\nspecial police operation at Sutton train station.\nFour of these crimes were the interception by the Border Force of drug\nshipments. Where such a shipment is to premises in our Ward it will count in\nour statistics.\nBURGLARY\nThere had been 21 burglaries or attempted burglaries. This included residential\nburglaries, burglaries of garages and sheds, and some burglaries of businesses.\nIt was noted that there was usually a seasonal increase in burglary at this time\nof year as it was darker earlier.\nThere had been eight residential burglaries. However, some that had been\nreported in sheltered accommodation in the Ward were later disproved and\nattributed to dementia. A disturbing case was that of a landlord who was able\nto let himself into a flat and commit theft. Two burglaries of garages had\ninvolved theft of bicycles.\nMention was made of a shop in Brighton Road where the window was\nsmashed and the wooden panel that was then put in place to secure the\npremises was pulled away to facilitate burglary. Mention was made of the\ntheft of tools from a construction site in the Ward.\nSome burglaries had involved the theft of keys, which were then used to\ncommit further offences (theft of a car key leading to theft of a car). The police\nstressed the need to make sure keys were kept out of sight – if the keys can be\nseen from your letterbox you are inviting crime.\nVEHICLE CRIME\nThere had been 14 instances of vehicle crime (theft of vehicles, damage to\nvehicles, theft from vehicles). The police stressed the need to avoid leaving\nanything of value on display in your car, or in the car at all. An unusual crime\nhad been the theft of an excavator and a dumper from the road works in\nBrighton Road.\nTHEFT\nThere had been 23 crimes in a category the police described as “theft and\nkindred (to theft)” events. This included shoplifting, parcel theft, theft of pedal\ncycles and mobile phones. Examples mentioned included theft of scrap metal,\ntheft of a wheelie bin and theft of a wedding ring by distraction techniques.\nMAJOR CRIMES\nThere had been nine major, violent crimes in the Ward. This included several\nrobberies at the train station, a large group altercation outside a restaurant, a\nfight between two drug users, and a concerning incident of a woman who was\nfollowed from the station and robbed. There were also two incidents of arson,\nof a bin and of a Ford transit. A ULEZ camera was deliberately damaged.\nThere was an incident where a drug user was searched and a knife, and bladed\narticles, were found to be in his possession.\nThere was a disturbing incident of an anti-semitic symbol being daubed on a\nwall outside the synagogue in Cedar Road. There had been a succession of\nincidents related to a woman living in Cedar Road who had engaged in anti-\nsocial activities that had attracted a community of drug users to her premises.\nThis was now the subject of police reports to the DPS that were expected to\nlead to her being charged with serious offences.\nSPEEDING\nThe police had been conducting a programme of visits to local care homes and\nsheltered housing to talk about scams. Residents had raised with them\nconcerns about speeding in Cavendish Road, which had led to police action in\nthat road. There was a discussion of speeding in local roads including\nChalgrove Road, Langley Park Road, The Ridgway and Cavendish Road. The\npolice had been carrying out speed checks in Chalgrove Road and Cavendish\nRoad. The action in Cavendish Road had led to twelve drivers receiving\nwarnings. The police would consider further action against speeding in local\nroads, subject to resources.\nOTHER MATTERS DISCUSSED\nStaffing levels: There should be in theory be a third officer on the Ward to\nsupport Robyn and Helen, but they were coping.\nThe number of “extractions” when they were called away to join police\nexercises elsewhere in London, or at the Croydon custody suite, remained an\nissue of concern but was now running close to 35% of their time rather than\nthe 50% it had once been.\nMention was made of local concern about a story that a body had been\ndiscovered at a house in Egmont Road. The police assured the meeting that\nthere was no wider implication of this incident.\nThe next meeting was tentatively scheduled for Wednesday 14 May at Devonshire Avenue school (7pm) subject to the police checking their work rota.\nThe meeting thanked Robyn for coming back from leave to attend the meeting\nand thanked the officers for their work for the community in dealing with\ncrime in the Ward. The meeting thanked Fiona Ostler for letting us meet at the school. The date of the next meeting was provisionally set as Wednesday 14 May, at Devonshire Avenue primary school and thought continues to be given to what could be done to better publicise the meeting and get a better attendance.\nSUPPORTING THE POLICE CADETS\nSutton South Councillors were concerned to learn about changes proposed to the organisation of the Police Cadets, who meet at a school in our ward. Currently there are over 120 cadets. However, the decision has been made to close junior cadets and cut the remaining senior cadets to just 46. Their future programme is also being severely curtailed. This will have a major impact on the youth of this borough who will no longer have the opportunity to participate in activities such as camps, parades and Duke of Edinburgh awards.\nCouncillor Louise Phelan, whose son has been a Cadet, commented “I’ve seen first-hand the benefits of being part of police cadets. They learn valuable life skills, and gain self confidence. They also support the local community and get to take part in things they wouldn’t otherwise have had the opportunity to do. For many this is a stepping stone into a career within the police force, for others the Cadets help to keep them on the right path and make better life decisions. I am incredibly concerned others will now not get these opportunities.”\nKINGS LANE\nRichard has been trying to get Network Rail to cut back the vegetation on the railway bank adjacent to the southern bridge in Kings Lane as it obscures sight lines for motorists. Every autumn, after the vegetation on the railway bank has grown up, he has this correspondence with Network Rail. They have now cut back the undergrowth sufficiently for cars to be able to see if there are vehicles coming towards them across the bridge.\nMORE APPLICATIONS FOR EXTRA STOREYS\nThe owners of Harrow Lodge, 28 Eaton Road, have used a device known as “Prior Approval” to obtain planning permission to extend the building – adding a storey to the top of the building, with some other changes. This will add 10 new flats to the building. In Mulgrave Road the owners of The Rowans, 47 Mulgrave Road, have similarly obtained planning application to add 8 new flats by adding two storeys to the top of the building. This is a current trend – to add extra storeys to the top of blocks of flats.\nThe applicants both used a device in national planning law known as “Prior Approval” which means that Councillors cannot take the application to the Council’s Planning Committee. We consider that this procedure was introduced to undermine the planning system and reduce local control of planning decisions. We are not able to stop these changes taking place as the system means the application has to be assessed by Council officers against a narrow set of criteria and if the application is refused the Planning Inspectorate, based in Bristol, has the power to over-ride local decisions.\nAs your local Councillors, we are concerned about these developments. While there is a need for more accommodation, these changes will involve building work that will impact on residents. However we seek to ensure that conditions are stipulated in any planning permission, if it is granted, to protect the peace and quiet of the residents during construction work. These include that access to the roof should be via an external hoist, the interior of the building should not be a storage area or building site, there should be a construction management plan, the contractors should join the Considerate Contractors’ Scheme, and there should be a liaison officer residents can contact. If scaffolding is erected it should only be erected when needed and removed as soon as it is not needed.\nA similar application for extra storeys on the roof of the building at Chelsea Court in Mulgrave Road was turned down on the basis of our representations that it would have made the building look incongruous.\nWe welcome feedback on your views on planning proposals. You can see the details of and comment on planning applications via the Sutton Council website (go to the section on planning) or comment by post to\nDevelopment Management, Civic Offices, St Nicholas Way, Sutton, SM1 1EA.\nNEW HOMES LOCALLY TO MEET THE HOUSING CRISIS\nOn 30 November Richard and Trish sat as members of the Council’s Planning Committee, with Richard chairing the meeting, to consider the fate of the B and Q site in central Sutton. This is just outside our Ward. B and Q plan to close the store next June. Richard commented that, though he is no do-it-yourself fanatic, he regretted the closure of the store, but B and Q say it no longer makes them money and they have decided to close.\nIt is inevitable that the site will be developed as housing. There is no demand for new office space (more people work at home) or new shops (more people shop using the internet) but there is a housing crisis. On the day of the discussion 970 Sutton families were homeless and living in bed and breakfast accommodation, at the expense of the Council and thus our Council tax payers. More homes are desperately needed. The philosophy in the Sutton local plan is to meet our housing targets partly through a more intensive area of development close to the town centre and near the railway station. As public transport links are good in this area it is possible to envisage a car free or “car light” development – if you have to provide a parking space for every house many fewer homes can be built. This reduces development pressure on the borough’s suburban heartland and Green Belt areas. Planning Committee often considers proposals to build on the Green Belt which we resist, but the new homes must go somewhere. The more intensive development in the town centre will inevitably include some tall buildings, and there is a cluster close to the railway station.\nEvidence was presented to the committee on action taken to deal with some of the consequences of this development, such as a need for places in local schools, demands on health services and additional strain on water and sewage systems. Richard commented that there were attractive features to the proposed development, 60% of which would be open space, including an area of public parkland, a water feature, an amphitheatre and terraced roof gardens. The most important aspect, though, was the plan for 337 “affordable” homes where Sutton Council can place the most deserving of the 2 600 families on the housing register. This will include families that are homeless or those we meet, in our Ward, who are living in dreadful housing circumstances – sometimes families with three or four children living together in tiny flats.\nThe planning application was approved. Initially all that local people will observe is the closure of the store, hoardings put up round the site and the store demolished. Then there will be building work but it will be several years before anyone moves in. Eventually, it will be an attractive, landscaped site. On the website\nthere is a video of a walk through a CGI representation of what the final product will look like.\nNOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR SUTTON: PLANNING APPLICATION IN MULGRAVE ROAD TURNED DOWN\nThe owner of Chelsea Court, 54 Mulgrave Road has had planning permission to extend the building – in effect adding two extra floors to the block of flats – refused by Sutton Council. This was the latest in a series of applications in our Ward where owners of blocks of flats have sought to extend the building upwards.\nAs local Councillors, we were concerned about these proposals. While there is a need for more accommodation, the changes to the building would in our view make it look incongruous, not good enough for Sutton. The block is an attractive architect-designed building (see photo), one of the more attractive blocks in Mulgrave Road, and the proposed changes would destroy the symmetry of the building. The Planning Department at Sutton Council agreed with our objections. The changes would also have involved building work that would greatly disturb the current residents of the block.\nThe owners used a mechanism called “prior approval” when submitting their planning application. This mechanism, in our view, was introduced by the Government to undermine the planning system. As a result, we could take the application to the Council’s Planning Committee, which Richard chairs, for decision by Councillors. We may still not be able to stop these changes taking place given the powers of the remote Planning Inspectorate based in Bristol to over-ride local decisions.\nWe always seek to ensure in such cases that a number of conditions are stipulated in any planning permission, if one is ever granted, to try to protect the peace and quiet of the building during construction work. These include that access to the roof should be via an external hoist with all materials for work on the roof transported to the roof by an external hoist and not brought up via the well of the building. The interior of the building should not be a storage area or building site. There should be a construction management plan to minimize disruption to existing residents and ensure there are controls on dust and noise, and on hours of work. The contractors should join the Considerate Contractors’ Scheme. There should be a liaison officer that residents can contact if they observe poor behaviour. If scaffolding is erected outside residents’ windows it should only be erected when needed and removed as soon as it is not needed.\nWe have successfully opposed this development but wait to see if the developer will appeal to the Planning Inspectorate against the decision of the Council.\nA VISIT TO CITY HALL TO PRESENT SUTTON’S PETITION OPPOSING THE EXTENSION OF ULEZ\nLouise, Richard and Trish travelled to City Hall, the HQ of London Mayor Sadiq Khan, on 30 June to join other Sutton Liberal Democrat Councillors in presenting a petition to the Mayor. The petition, signed by over 10 000 Sutton residents, expressed our opposition to the extension of the ULEZ zone to outer London boroughs. Our views on why we opposed the extension of ULEZ can be found in posts further down this site.\nDespite our opposition, ULEZ has now been extended by the London Mayor to outer London.\nFURTHER PROPOSALS FOR NORTHUMBERLAND HOUSE\nWe are again involved in arguments over proposals to add extra storeys the top of Northumberland House.\nNorthumberland House is the tower block at the corner of Brighton Road and Wellesley Road, about 200 yards along Brighton Road if you turn left when coming out of Sutton station.\nCriterion Capital, the owners of Northumberland House, are again seeking planning permission to add two storeys to the top of the building. The owners are again seeking to extend the building, creating a further 29 flats by adding two extra storeys on the top of the ten storey part of the building and an extra storey on the lower part, with some additional flats in the “undercroft” above the parking area. Some of the current parking spaces would be lost.\nAn earlier similar application was not supported by Sutton Council on the basis of design of the proposed tower extension and issues about the alignment of the windows. Planning law allows developers to seek to over-ride the decisions of local Councillors by appealing to the remote Bristol-based Planning Inspectorate, whose decision is final. The developers went to appeal, to the Planning Inspectorate, and on 5 October Richard and Louise attended and spoke on behalf of residents at a hearing organised by the Planning Inspectorate.\nWe had noted that there would be some positives, such as the creation of a community amenity and play space on the tarmaced area at ground floor level. However, while there is a shortage of accommodation in London and more housing is needed, we were concerned that the building work had the potential to be extremely disruptive to the lives of current residents. And an extra two storeys on the top of the building looks incongruous and out of keeping with the design of the rest of the building. Richard told the Inspector the design “looked like a couple of portacabins had been dumped on the top of the building.” At the hearing we told the Planning Inspector that residents of Northumberland House are concerned about the likely disruption involved in this proposed work, and have long standing concerns about frequent lift breakdowns in the building and the general standard of housekeeping, particularly in the bin area. We pressed the Inspector to impose conditions, if he were to agree to the scheme, to protect the interests of residents, and include these conditions in any planning permission they eventually obtained. We asked that access to the roof areas would be only by external hoists, and that the peace and quiet of the interior of the building would not be disturbed or the interior turned into a storage area, or building site. We sought controls on scaffolding to ensure any scaffolding that is required is removed as soon as the requirement has passed. We insisted there must be a construction management plan to control hours of work and control noise and dust nuisance. We asked that the contractor joins the “Considerate Contractors Scheme”, which provides a route for residents to raise concerns if they observe poor behaviour. We were pleased that the developers indicated they would accept all these conditions.\nThe Inspector supported our views and commented that the proposed building looks “incongruous” – the exact wording Richard had used at the hearing. He turned down the application and also refused the application for costs.\nThe owners have now submitted a further, similar application. Residents can see the proposals via the Council’s website (go to the section on planning and follow leads to get to comment on planning applications). It is application DM2023/00796. We are keen to learn of the views of residents on this matter, particularly those who live in Northumberland House. Do contact us at the email addresses given in the first post on this site.",
  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_author_richardclifton_page_32/content_808.html": "Our long-running campaign to open the side entrance to Sutton station has taken a major step forward, with the acceptance of the Council’s submission to Transport for London of a bid for £740 000 worth of funding under the TfL Major Projects scheme.\nThe project, known as the Sutton Station Gateway Major Scheme bid, will need to be the subject of further negotiation, so is not finally home and dry, but we are hopeful that it will proceed next year following confirmation from Transport for London that the bid was successful. We have been awarded £740,000 for this scheme in the 2013/14 financial year.\nRichard says “We have made this a major campaign since we were elected. Initial setbacks, such as the rejection of a bid by the Mayor under the Outer London Fund Scheme, have not deterred us. If this now goes ahead it will be good news for the residents of Sutton South Ward, particularly who commute from Sutton station, giving easier access to the station and an improved frontage in The Quadrant.”\nSutton station is the 5th busiest in South London, and the 27th busiest in the whole of Greater London, with almost 6 million passenger movements every year. It is one of 18 stations in London identified by TfL as suffering significant congestion problems.\nThe main elements in the scheme not only include opening the side entrance but extensive landscaping to improve the appearance of what will in effect be a new entrance from The Quadrant. The main elements include:\n* Opening up the side entrance to the station to improve station access and egress, improve the streetscape and improve pedestrian access to the station\n* Public realm and footway improvements in The Quadrant and at the front of the station\n* Bus stop improvements at the front of the station to improve passenger experience\n* “De-cluttering” and harmonisation of street furniture and materials\n* Junction and crossing improvements on walking routes to the station\n* Road safety improvements\n* Additional cycle parking and cycle lanes, and\n* Improved street lighting.\nBenefits of the scheme will include reduced pedestrian journey times between the station and The Quadrant, the station car park and the Langley Park Road area, as well as reduced congestion within the station main entrance and at the barriers.\nOpening the side entrance at Sutton Station will cater for the considerable demand for direct access to the station from the Quadrant House office block, which houses Reed Business Information (with approximately 2,000 employees, about one third of whom travel to work by train) and a number of other expanding companies, together with the Tudor Court office block, which houses Synergy UK. The new entrance will also serve the large station car park (which Network Rail wish to expand), and the motorcycle and cycle parking areas, which generate considerable demand for access from that side of the station. There is also direct footpath access between The Quadrant and Langley Park Road and surrounding residential streets, well-used by rail passengers. These station users currently have to walk around the side to the front of the station on a convoluted route and negotiate busy footways, bus stops and the station entrance. Most of these passengers are likely to have season tickets, and opening up the side entrance will significantly reduce their journey times and congestion outside and in the entrance hall of the main station entrance.\nWhile the Council has been lobbying for the opening up of the side entrance since the entrance was created with a retractable shutter ten years ago, the campaign took on new impetus when Richard and Heather were elected in 2010. The entrance is opened up when rail replacement buses are used during engineering work, as the buses stop in The Quadrant. This demonstrates that it is possible to open and use the entrance. Southern has supported the opening in principle, subject to funding being available to provide the barriers etc. Network Rail has also supported the scheme in principle and has assisted with business case work.\nWe will keep readers advised of further progress in the negotiations that are now underway. At the Council meeting on 14 January Richard sought re-assurance that elements such as lighting in the Quadrant and cycle parking will not be lost.",

These events are organised to provide an opportunity for residents to raise issues of concern with SHP staff. SHP’s Chief Executive and senior SHP staff attended. A high proportion of the residents are leaseholders and many took part. The residents said they appreciated the recent re-location of the refuse bins and the re-painting of the entrance gate. Some “snagging” arising from the recent renovation work on the buildings was noted and various other concerns of the residents explored.\nOn 19 October all three Councillors attended similar “Community Walkabouts” at Sutton Court and at Beauclere House, in Brighton Road. These were again well attended by residents. A wide variety of issues were raised including the use of the garages, parking, dealing with anti-social behaviour and lighting. These exercises were thought to have been very useful by those who took part. The photo shows the group at Kingslee Court.",
  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_category_crime_page_2/content_59.html": "Sutton is renowned for low crime and good schools. Like all London boroughs we have had to deal with the bulge in pupil numbers. This has gone through the primary school system and our excellent local primary schools in this area have been able to cope, with most parents still getting their first choice of school. Many secondary schools in Sutton have expanded, including our popular local school Overton Grange, but two new secondary schools will still be needed and are planned. The new Harris Academy, integrated into the Sutton Cancer Hub development, is already proving popular with parents who plan to apply for places next year. Parents can be reassured that Sutton will be able to cope with the increased numbers without a fall in the high quality of local education or unacceptable congestion problems at the schools, which the schools have plans in place to cope with.\nSLOWING TRAFFIC IN FARM ROAD AND GRANGE VALE\nAt the South Sutton, Cheam and Belmont Local Committee meeting on 7 September our main decision was to install a vehicle operated sign in Farm Road to reduce speeding. Richard lives round the corner from Farm Road and vehicles certainly speed down it. This complements other measures in the Ward to reduce speeding, in particular in Cavendish Road and Cedar Road.\nWe also agreed to install a width restriction at the point in Grange Vale where the road passes under the bridge. The speed of vehicles has a safety implication for pedestrians walking west to east on the narrow pathway, particularly if pushing a buggy. We also agreed to plant a replacement for the vandalised tree in Willis Avenue. The committee also agreed Richard’s proposal to purchase from the Royal British Legion a “Silent Soldier” and install it in the flower beds in front of Northumberland House. These are large silhouettes of soldiers, designed to be installed through 2018 in prominent places to remind us that this is the centenary of the conclusion of the Great War.\nWe hope the parking consultation will now take place much earlier than anticipated.\nTACKLING SPEEDING ON THE ROADS OF SUTTON SOUTH\nCRIME REMAINS LOW IN SUTTON SOUTH\nTrish and Richard attended the Ward police consultative committee meeting on 10 January. The police again reported that crime in our area remains low.\nIn the final quarter of 2016 there were 3 residential burglaries in our Ward (down from 6 in the corresponding period a year previously), 3 non-residential burglaries (down from 7), 7 thefts from motor vehicles (down from 12) and 2 thefts of motor bikes.\nThe police had executed a number of drug searches in the last quarter, which they felt had had a positive impact. Priorities continue to include drugs, looking out for rough sleepers in stairwells of blocks of flats, anti-social behaviour at bus stops, speeding checks and aggressive begging around Sutton station.\nThe police consultative panel next meets at Christchurch hall in Christchurch Park on 9 May. This is a public meeting. See if you can come.\nThere were several “Speedwatch” events in the last quarter, some involving students from Overton Grange school, using a speed gun to catch and warn speeding motorists.\nSUTHERLAND HOUSE – NOW NORTHUMBERLAND HOUSE: RESIDENTS MOVE IN\nResidents have started to move in to the the block in the Brighton Road just south of Sutton station that we all knew as Sutherland House but which now has a new name – Northumberland House. Perhaps the owners changed the name as – after it being empty for five years – they want to signal a new beginning for this building. They have spent money on the renovation and certainly improved the way it looks, as the pictures above show.\nThe apartments in the block, a few hundred yards south of Sutton station and in our Ward, are available to rent. The Acorn Group are in charge of renting out the flats. If anyone is interested in renting they can contact Kimberley Ellen (kimberley.ellen@acorn.ltd.uk or ring her 020 8315 6917). The flats are also advertised on the website Rightmove.\nOn 14 January Richard visited the block. It has been refurbished to a high standard and it is good to see it occupied. There are 128 flats with parking spaces.\nAs long ago as December 2015 we met with Council officers and the developer to discuss renovation of the front, to fit in with the Gateway scheme further north. We have sought agreement that the owners fund the renovation of the area in front of the building, to bring it up to the same standard as the area renovated during the “Gateway” project just to the north. The shops at the bottom are not fully let out and we have hopes that the area just south of the station will include of a mix of good restaurants, shops and maybe a wine bar as the area will have so much more footfall. We are pleased that the Rose cafe and Sofra are surviving. We look forward to the area in front of the building being renewed and improved in due course and the vacant shops let out. However Sainsburys have pulled out of opening a store at the bottom.\nThe area has in the past suffered from a group of “all day drinkers” who walk the streets drinking alcohol from cans. However, one of Richard’s first acts when elected in 2010 was to get the “no drinking” zone extended from Sutton town centre into Sutton South Ward. This makes it unlawful to drink alcohol in public in the area if a police officer asks you to stop.\nTAKING CRIME SERIOUSLY\nSutton South Ward has one of the lowest crime levels in London, but we cannot be complacent and need to take the simple precautions necessary to avoid making life easy for the criminal.\nWe are well served by our local police, and we meet them regularly to assess crime trends in the Ward. There are many blocks of flats in the Ward and recently there have been a small number of incidents reported to us of rough sleepers spending the night in stairwells.\nThe problem of homelessness has, of course, increased recently due to Government housing policies. We have been involved in discussions with housing managers and the police about precautions such as entryphone systems and sought to help local groups that are trying to deal with the problem of homelessness and rough sleeping. If you observe rough sleepers in stairwells it is best to contact the police on the non-emergency 101 number. They can also be directed to sources of advice such as the Salvation Army (02086429862), Shelter (02034686293) and the Sutton Civic offices (02087705800).\nLOCAL POLICE PRIORITIES ASSESSED\nOn 12 July Trish and Richard attended the police consultative group meeting for Sutton South Ward, held in the church hall at Christchurch. It is a pity these public meetings attract so few members of the public, only four tonight. The police priorities for the next quarter will include seeking Neighbourhood Watch co-ordinators at Farm Close and Audley Place, and tackling the problem of rough sleepers in Ambleside Gardens and Beauclere House, in Brighton Road. There was also discussion of the theft of bins at blocks of flats in Brighton Road and in Christchurch Park. The overall level of crime in the area remains low.\nThe police are very keen to monitor any community tensions that might have arisen as a result of the EU referendum. Emotions may run high for a while and there have been some reports in the national media about a rise in hate crime and harassment in some areas. We have not heard of any such incidents locally; but obviously the police rely very much upon the community and the Neighbourhood Watch to monitor things like this for them.\nIf you have detected any such issues – or know of anyone who has – please do not hesitate to contact Sutton police to report them.\nIf anyone wishes to make an anonymous report they can always call Crimestoppers at any time – day or night – on 0800 555 111, in complete confidence.\nOn 6 July Richard, by invitation, attended the Eid celebrations held annually in Overton Park (see picture above) at the end of Ramadan, to show his support for multculturalism and opposition to hate crime.\nCllr Ruth Dombey, Leader of Sutton Council, Niall Bolger, Chief Executive of Sutton Council, Cllr Tim Crowley, Leader of the Opposition at Sutton Council, and Sutton Borough Police Commander Dave Stringer said in a joint statement on 30 June:\n“Since the EU referendum result there have been media reports of hate crimes against people living in this country. However, there has been no increase in hate crime incidents reported to the police in Sutton and across London.\n“We are grateful that Sutton has not seen an increase in such intolerant and antisocial behaviour. The vote is not a licence for racist and xenophobic behaviour. We would urge residents to be vigilant to ensure that all borough citizens continue to live together in a peaceful, harmonious and responsible way.\n“We are aware that certain events can spur intolerance, hate or extremism. Anyone who witnesses or suffers any hate incident of any type should report it immediately to the Police so that they can take action and deal with any incidents quickly.\n“Sutton is a popular place to live, in part because we are a tolerant, open society that values people of all cultures, nationalities and religions. At this time it is more important than ever that we show solidarity with our neighbours of all different faith and cultural groups to ensure that extremist views and behaviour have no part of our community.”\nACTION ON PORNOGRAPHY\nTrish is continuing her campaign to seek action on the allegations that pornographic films have been shot at locations in the Borough. She has recently been interviewed by both BBC radio and BBC television about these allegations, that pornographic films have been shot at public locations in the Borough, including one close to her home. Trish rightly said she was outraged by this, as it was an act of indecency in public, and children or other members of the public might observe it. The police should take action if they encounter such behaviour and seek additional powers if more powers are needed.\nThere is, of course, no evidence that this type of filming of obscene acts is any more prevalent in Sutton than elsewhere, as no-one is collecting data, but one has to have a concern about the people taking part in such filming (are these trafficked women?) and the possibility that such public acts of indecency might be observed by people, who will of course be horrified. And we all deplore pornography.\nHOLOCAUST MEMORIAL DAY\nOn 27 January we supported Holocaust Memorial Day. There was a moving event, a meeting and discussion held at Sutton Boys’ Grammar school. There were interesting presentations on the Holocaust and some discussion of other acts of genocide, including those in Rwanda, Bosnia and Dafur.\nTOP MARKS FOR SUTTON SOUTH POLICE\nSUTTON SOUTH WARD POLICE/COMMUNITY PANEL MEETING 5 JANUARY 2016\nTrish and Richard attended their first local meeting of 2016 when they attended the consultative panel for Sutton South Ward set up by the police, on January 5, in Christchurch hall.\nThe police had reported at the previous meeting that that there had been a further fall in the total number of crimes in our Ward in the most recent three month period, a fall of 1.5% compared to the period a year previously. The downward trend has continued and data were presented to the meeting to show that the number of residential and non-residential burglaries in the last four months are down compared to the figures for the corresponding period in 2014. Sutton South Ward continues to have one of the lowest crime rates in London. It will be difficult to reduce it further.\nPriorities remain tackling burglary, anti-social behaviour and speeding. The police are continuing to conduct some evening and night patrols with the objective of tackling rough sleepers in certain blocks of flats.\nThe threat to the future of PCSOs (Police Community Support Officers, the backbone of our neighbourhood policing approach) remains a matter of concern.\nAn exercise to test public satisfaction with the police has found that satisfaction rates are highest in Sutton, of all London boroughs.",

It was the first meeting for a long time as the summer meeting was cancelled at a late point due to it being on the evening of one of the football matches England were involved in in the World Cup. It was a meeting that left us feeling worried. An increase in crime, in burglaries and thefts from motor vehicles, was reported for the first time for some time. This may not be unrelated to problems of police numbers following the merger with Croydon and Bromley. There were a significant number of unfilled posts, vacancies, that the police were struggling to fill, particularly PCSOs (Police Community Support Officers). These officers are important for work on community relations. One member of staff was about to be moved to work in Croydon and we have again lost our Dedicated Ward Officer, Kellie Heath. Kellie has also moved to Croydon.\nWe hope for a better attendance on 8 March and welcome a new Chair, Aime.",

  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_page_29/content_637.html": "It fell to Richard, as vice-chair of Sutton’s Housing, Economy and Business Committee, to make the case, when the Committee met on 18 June, for the scrutiny report prepared by the Committee on the Council’s procedures to deal with those about to become homeless.\nRichard told the Committee that homelessness – being put in bed and breakfast accommodation often far from Sutton – is a terrible experience, especially for families. It can lead to people losing their jobs if they are too far away to travel back every day. It can lead to mental breakdown, marriage breakdown, and the disruption of the education of children. Our first priority is to avoid this, and it is not too much to ask landlords to wait a week or two in some cases before a property is vacated as a last effort is made to find somewhere else to live.\nThe report commended the approach that the Council has traditionally used, and was implicitly critical of modifications to the procedure introduced in Feruary to respond to some criticisms of the approach that, the scrutiny report concluded, were not well founded.\nThis was the first scrutiny study undertaken by one of the Council’s subject committees established when governance arrangements were revised last year. The Committee studied a number of documents when it met on 19 March, and listened to a variety of views, from Council officers, from officers from a neighbouring authority (Croydon) and a landlord who voiced criticisms of the Council’s approach. It was evident from these documents that Sutton’s approach is identical to that of most, indeed almost all, London Boroughs.\nThe report describes the procedures followed by the Council. To evict a tenant from a property a landlord has to go through a legal procedure with a number of steps commencing with a notice to quit and ending with the execution of a bailiff’s warrant.\nRichard, whose daughter works for the largest charity supporting the homeless in the West Midlands, commented:\n“This is a procedure involving a private landlord and a private tenant, so it is worthwhile just reminding ourselves why the Council gets involved atall. This is because at the end of the procedure, if someone has no other accommodation and is homeless and in priority need, the obligation falls on the Council to find them accommodation. This usually means putting them in bed and breakfast accommodation, something that can be soul destroying for the family or individual concerned, and an expensive procedure involving costs that ultimately fall on our own Council tax payers.\nSo, the Council has a unit doing all in its power to assist those threatened with homelessness to find new accommodation. The report shows that in many cases they are successful, and that alternative accommodation is often found quite late in the eviction process. If they are not successful, at the end of the process the tenant will be put into bed and breakfast accommodation, but this is rightly regarded as a last resort to be undertaken when all else has failed. The process followed is described in Appendix A of the paper, and the first recommendation in the paper is to support the approach described, on the basis that this offers the best chance of minimising the numbers made homeless, thus minimising both the cost and human misery that homelessness involves, but correctly discharging the Council’s legal duties to those threatened with homelessness.\nThe criticisms of the approach, first voiced by Councillor Shields at a Council meeting, picked up by the local paper in the memorable but misleading headline “Council says wait till the bailiffs arrive”, and repeated by at least one landlord, appear to be that by waiting to the end of the process the Council runs the risk of upsetting landlords and thus discouraging landlords from working with the Council. It was also suggested that the tenants are disadvantaged by having a Court judgement against them. But the evidence in the paper (paragraphs 2.18 to 2.30) is that the Council maintains good relations with landlords, and that the Court judgement relates to possession of a property and does not affect the standing of the individual or family made homeless.\nOfficers told us, however, that for a period from February 2013 a modified approach was trialled, described in Appendix B, involving moving earlier to accept someone was homeless if it appeared that there was no realistic prospect of finding alternative accommodation. It is not often that, in assessing policy options, one can compare the outcome from two periods where different policies were tried. But the evidence in the paper (see paragraphs 2.16 and 3.8) is that the modified approach led to an increase in homelessness, as accommodation is often found for those threatened with homelessness quite late in the process.\nSo the recommendations support our continuing to follow the procedures described in Appendix A, but also call on officers to continue to work closely with landlords, keep the trends and statistics under review, and report back to us in due course.\nHomelessness – being put in bed and breakfast accommodation often far from Sutton – is a terrible experience, especially for families. I know from my casework that it can lead to people losing their jobs if they are too far away to travel back every day, to mental breakdown, to marriage breakdown, and to the disruption of the education of children. Our first priority is to avoid this, and it is not too much to ask landlords to wait a further week or two in some cases before a property is vacated as a last effort is made to find somewhere else to live.”",

Councillor Clifton said “I called for the campaign to continue as I felt the arguments were on our side. I am disappointed that the campaign has not come to a successful conclusion.”",

We have found some local residents believe the threat to these services has now gone away. This is not so.\nWhat has happened is that the Surrey Downs Clinical Commissioning Group (General Practice doctors in Surrey) voted to withdraw from what is known as the “Better Services Better Value acute reconfiguration process” – that is public consultation on the set of proposals that would have led, amongst other changes, to the closure of the St Helier A and E Department. There are six other Clinical Commissioning Groups involved in the review. The vote by Surrey Downs has led to the suspension of the public consultation process on the proposals and required those involved to take stock and re-consider. However, it is certain that a fresh set of proposals will come forward in 2014 and the changes proposed for St. Helier are not yet abandoned.\nResidents have also asked us about a report, published by NHS England in mid-November, that suggested establishment of a two-tier accident and emergency service. This would possibly bring to an end closure of A and E Departments, designating 40 to 70 A and E units as “major centres” with specialist services, while the remaining 70 to 100 units would be known as “emergency centres” dealing with less seriously ill patients. However, these are longer term plans and do not affect the immediate situation concerning St. Helier.\nSo the campaign continues. We will keep this site updated.",

Each year the Council has a leaf clearing programme in place, where a team is deployed to all roads/streets that suffer from significant leaf fall. No Council can keep every road entirely free of leaves during the autumn leaf fall period, as resources are not unlimited. However, there is a programme that will, over a period, gradually clear away the fallen leaves.\nAs part of the South London Waste Partnership contract with Veolia, dedicated resources are provided for leafing, in support of the core street cleaning service. The operation is in two parts.\nFirst, throughout the borough leaves should be cleared by beat sweepers as they break down and start to lose their shape and structure. Gully grates should also be kept clear, by beat sweepers, to help minimise surface water runoff and drainage. Second, the dedicated Veolia team will work to clear leaves throughout the borough, aiming to ensure they do not become hazardous to road users and pedestrians, turning into detritus and blocking road-side gullies with danger of flooding. If there are particular streets that residents feel need to be addressed more urgently, we ask that this is done through the Report It function on the Council website.\nCommencement of the dedicated resource is a joint decision with Veolia and is based on the level of leaf fall and forecast weather conditions. The leaf fall programme is likely to start in the first week of November. There is an operational document that schedules which roads will be visited by the dedicated leafing team and when. As with all operational documents, and particularly with leafing, those involved have to be prepared to respond to weather conditions, to locations where demand and need is greatest, taking decisions on the basis of available resources. This means that the schedule is being constantly reviewed.\nIf residents or a community/resident group would like to get involved in clearing leaves from streets or communal areas please contact Council officers. Simply complete our Community Clean-Up Event Form with a few details. We can provide bags for use and will arrange for them to be collected from a pre-arranged location.\nLeaves from residents own property can be disposed through our paid for Garden Waste service or taken free of charge to the reuse and recycling centre at Kimpton Park Way, Sutton SM3 9QH. Alternatively, a garden composting bin could be used.\nResidents should not sweep leaves from their own property into the road.",

Changes to the S4 route that affected our area are not implemented and it will still run to Overton Grange school and along Grange Road.

Access to their websites has been blocked on all council computers.\nAccess to over 170 sites – such as Wonga.com and 247cashline.com – have been barred from all Council PCs, including those in public spaces like libraries. The move aims to help protect local people from the quick cash companies and avoid sky high interest rates.\nRichard welcomed the move, calling again for new controls on payday loan companies.\nHe pointed out that figures released as part of Sutton Council’s “Economy Watch – Economic Indicators” report show an alarming rise in debt enquiries from Sutton residents to the Citizens Advice Bureau. Richard said, in a letter to residents, “I am increasingly concerned that people are turning to these companies without looking into the real costs of borrowing money, which in some cases that I have investigated are well over 1000% APR.”\nSpeaking to the Council’s Housing, Economy and Business Committee about the latest data on Sutton’s economic performance, on 18 June, Richard pointed out that enquiries to Sutton’s Citizens Advice Bureau were up by about 5% in the last quarter with debt enquiries increasing by 8.8%. There has to be a fear that recent welfare cuts will make the position worse.\nIn a letter to residents he called for consideration to be given to establishing by law some upper limit on the interest rate that can be charged on loans.\nThe Leader of Sutton Council, Councillor Ruth Dombey, said: “Payday lenders prey on people who are at their most vulnerable and in need of quick financial assistance. Sometimes people don’t realise the trouble taking out one of these irresponsible loans can do for them in the long run. A small initial loan can lead to thousands of pounds of debt and an irreversible downward spiral.\n“This is a small yet significant step towards protecting local people from these companies. I’d urge anyone who needs advice to speak to their bank or the local credit union.”\nPeople who live, work or study in Croydon, Merton or Sutton can start saving at the CMS Credit Union. Credit unions are savings and loans co-operative businesses that are committed to promoting saving rather than borrowing. Anyone who saves with a credit union becomes a member. The members’ savings are pooled to form a sum of money from which members can borrow at those times when they need to.\nFor more information about CMS Credit Union click on this link.",

  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_category_planning_page_5/content_178.html": "At Sutton Council’s “Bonfire night” meeting on 5 November, Richard moved a motion criticising the Government proposals annnounced on 5 September to weaken planning law. The Council agreed a motion directed to the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government calling for a re-think. The motion criticised the proposed extension of permitted development rights and the envisaged interference of the Planning Inspectorate in local decisions on planning applications, affordable housing and section 106 contributions.\nHere is the full text of Richard’s Speech:\n“It is right that the London Borough of Sutton, which has been at the intellectual vanguard of so many policies in local Government, should be at the forefront in leading a campaign against the proposals of the Government to weaken planning law.\nThe motion is a balanced motion in that we are complimenting the Government on aspects of the announcement made on 6 September that we support, but we are making clear what we oppose.\nWe support proposals concerning the funding of new affordable housing, the refurbishment of empty homes, support for the FirstBuy shared equity scheme and support for housing associations.\nBut we are critical of the extension of permitted development rights, and the envisaged interference of the Planning Inspectorate in local decisions on planning applications, affordable housing and section 106 contributions.\nWhat we are saying tonight is entirely consistent with our actions and our words on planning issues.\nIt is consistent with our words in that we had an excellent debate on planning policy at the Council meeting on 17 October last year. I remember speaking in that debate and noting what we have achieved in Sutton in adopting and refining a planning policy that has secured the green, pleasant, suburban character of Sutton that we all treasure. But we noted in that debate threats and concerns that arose from national policy. We welcomed many aspects of the National Planning Policy Framework but saw four difficulties with the planning system that should be addressed – and for each of these I could cite specific examples in Sutton South Ward:\n1. that what is permitted development is already quite permissive and is leading to people building large and intrusive structures that should be brought within planning controls\n2. that the planning system is slow moving in dealing with developers who are recalcitrant and play the system\n3. the decisions of the Planning Inspectorate are sometimes inconsistent and unhelpful\n4. the Courts do not always seem to take breaches of planning law seriously.\nThese problems remain but, sadly, the Government has not taken our advice set out in the motion we passed. Indeed, it has moved in an opposite direction in what is now proposed.\nWhat is proposed seems to abandon the National Planning Policy Framework, does not address any of the problems that concerned us, and loosens further permitted development law.\nI do not believe for one second that the relaxation of requirements to seek planning permission for extensions to domestic properties is going to unleash an avalanche of building work, thus creating jobs. To the extent that this happens, it follows that this will be through the erection of buildings that would not be permitted under current arrangements. So this is a recipe for neighbourhood disputes and the erection of ugly buildings that society does not want, and that we certainly do not want in Sutton.\nI also particularly object to the way the package deals with affordable housing and section 106 contributions. Like most of you, I find that quite a lot of my casework as a Councillor involves families that are living in poor circumstances, often because they cannot find and afford accommodation that fits their needs. We desperately need more affordable housing. There are already “get out” clauses for developers who present financial analyses seemingly proving their development is unviable if they have to provide affordable housing. I am deeply suspicious of those processes and now there are to be further “get out” routes involving the Planning Inspectorate.\nWhat we say in this motion is also consistent with our actions. We have adopted stringent controls on development to ensure it meets the local needs of Sutton, particularly on the development of major sites and on back garden development. We do not want these interfered with by remote bodies in Whitehall and Bristol.\nWe have worked hard to control development in Sutton in a way that meets what local people want. And so much flows from the way the character of the area is preserved by our planning policies, making it an attractive environment for businesses and families. I never tire of telling people of the virtues of Sutton – low crime, good schools, attractive leafy streets, good transport connections, voted the best place in London to bring up children, a local economy that is surviving the recession well. All these things, to my mind, hinge crucially on having an attractive local environment and street scene.\nI hope these proposals will be re-thought.\nI strongly believe, in the words of the motion, that it is local people, through democratically elected local authorities, who are the best judges of what development is acceptable in an area.\nI commend this motion to Council.”",

And Heather, speaking in the same debate, drew attention to particular successes in our own Ward.\nThe motion noted that Sutton is in the top three London Boroughs for the percentage of the adult population in work, at 81%, that it has lower unemployment than the average in London, that there has been record business growth in the last year and an increasing rate of business start ups.\nRichard drew attention to the programme spearheaded by the Housing, Economy and Business Committee to match the skills of the local workforce to the growing sectors in the local economy. The full text of his speech is on his blog, on this website (see “Richard’s Blog”). Here is the text of Heather’s speech.\nWhat Heather said to Council about jobs in Sutton 4th November 2013\n“As someone who spent nearly twenty five years working for British companies, I am pleased to speak in favour of this motion.\nThat experience is why I have strongly supported Subsea 7”s vote of confidence in Sutton and its wish to expand here. I regard this as a litmus test for business support in this Borough. Because the company is growing and winning contracts overseas. This is what we need. It plans to create nearly 500 new jobs in Sutton, and not just in engineering. This was described by a Conservative as “just a few” earlier in this debate.\nThose jobs are vital in the current economic climate and should not be dismissed. Those extra jobs will lead to more business for local shops, cafes and restaurants. Surprisingly the Leader of the Opposition found this difficult to understand at a recent Strategy and Resources Committee.\nSubsea 7 wants to encourage people in Sutton to understand the opportunities in engineering. For the last few years the company has been going into local schools and talking to young people about careers in engineering, and it plans to expand this, for example by inviting GCSE and A Level students into their offices to get “up close and personal “ and see the excitement that there is in engineering.\nWe need engineers if British manufacturing is to compete internationally. The company’s new investment will also lead to over £500,000 in community developments through section 106 funding. In my book that means more jobs.\nThe company must therefore have been surprised to find that the immediate reaction from the local Conservatives was to oppose its plans to expand. As we heard tonight, they continue to do so.\nNo wonder William Hague had to pay a flying visit down here!\nI am delighted to be a member of the local party that has been so successful at the ballot box that it can offer practical measures to support business rather than the hot airwe get from the Opposition.”",
  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_2012_09_15_action-to-save-cross-london-train-services/content_88.html": "Response to the Department for Transport Combined Thameslink Franchise Consultation\nFrom Councillor Richard Clifton and Councillor Heather Honour, Liberal Democrat Councillors for Sutton South, London Borough of Sutton\n1. We are the elected Liberal Democrat Councillors for Sutton South Ward, which is just south of Sutton railway station. Passengers leaving Sutton station to the south, by the side entrance (when it is open), pass into Sutton South Ward as they leave the station.\n2. Our Ward is almost entirely residential and a significant number of our residents commute daily into central London for work. Many of these commuters use trains on the Thameslink Loop Line to travel to stations north of Blackfriars, including Farringdon and St. Pancras. Residents of the Ward also tell us they consider they benefit greatly from having a direct service to St. Pancras International, for Continental Europe, and Luton airport.\n3. For that reason we are concerned at the proposal, first set out in the London and South East Route Utilisation Strategy (July 2011), that all Sutton / Wimbledon Thameslink Loop Line trains will terminate at London Blackfriars from 2018.\n4. Terminating Wimbledon Loop services at Blackfriars would result in our residents losing their cross-London service. This will penalise those of our residents who have made their residential, employment and educational location decisions on the basis of the existence of the cross-London Thameslink service. These residents, who chose to live in Sutton South on the basis of an existing pattern of transport connections, would lose a service that they have had for many years, and based their life around.\n5. Any decision should take account of the impact of changes on the travel patterns of existing passengers, and of consequent requirements to change established travel patterns. It is because of the impact on our residents that we object to any proposal that would result in terminating Wimbledon loop trains at Blackfriars.\n6. Not only would our residents lose a through service they have come to depend on, they would lose their connection with Eurostar and domestic long distance trains at St. Pancras International and Kings Cross. Instead they would have to change trains at Blackfriars, carrying possibly heavy luggage onto already crowded trains. This movement could be particularly difficult from the western bay platform when travelling north and to either bay platform when travelling south because of the platform lengths and the position of lifts and stairs at each end of the platforms. The recent Passenger Focus passenger survey found that having to change trains was a strong disincentive to train travel.\n7. Sutton is identified in the London Plan as one of only four Metropolitan town centres in south London , with a large and growing population and employment base. It is a major business centre with many commuters and business travellers. It is therefore essential that Sutton, as a strategic south London destination, retains its connections to central and north London and beyond, and maintains its direct link to St. Pancras and the City.\n8. We also believe that the attractiveness of Sutton to employers considering re-location away from expensive offices in central London would be affected. Sutton is a location from which one can travel to Brussels with just two train journeys, one taking 45 minutes and one two hours, and the journey to Paris is only fifteen minutes longer. We have been successful in attracting businesses to Sutton and this change would have a negative impact, particularly given the expected mushrooming of international train travel from St. Pancras over the next few years. These negative effects would impact on the residents of our Ward who want to work locally in Sutton.\n9. We thus strongly object to any proposal that would result in terminating Wimbledon loop trains at Blackfriars from 2018.\n10. We are aware that Sutton Council is submitting comments, and support those comments. However, we are making this submission to draw particular attention to the impact on our residents in Sutton South Ward.\nRICHARD CLIFTON\nHEATHER HONOUR\nLiberal Democrat Councillors for Sutton South, London Borough of Sutton\nDear Heather and Richard,\nCongratulations on an informative campaigning website – obviously working extremely hard. Take care.\nRegards,\nJenny\nHi Jenny\nStruggling with comments section of website and just found your comment from last August.

This consultation is called the Sutton Link and seeks views on bringing the tram to Sutton, or developing what is called a new Bus Rapid Transport (BRT) route. You can respond to the consultation at\nhttp://www.tfl.gov.uk/sutton-link\nCouncillor Whitehead, the Chair of Sutton Council’s transport liaison committee, and Sutton Council officers will be meeting with TfL London Buses in the New Year to discuss how bus services can be tailored to meet future development proposals in the borough. It will also provide an opportunity to raise any issues related to any shortcomings with existing services. A similar meeting has been held in previous years but Councillor Whitehead tells us a more thorough review of outer London services is now promised by TfL.\nThis is an opportunity to set out views on any changes we would like to see made to services in the area, including changes to frequencies or the duration of services, or route diversions/extensions to provide missing connections.\nOfficers will consider how this information is presented to TfL. However, the final decision on any such changes rests with TfL and there will be limited resources available.\nLocal residents in Sutton South Ward have raised with us the following concerns when consulted in the recent past.\nRoute frequency – although residents have commented that on some routes, such as route 80, frequency and reliability is good, bus 470 is seen as too infrequent, being only about every half hour.\nSimilarly, route S4 could be more frequent.\nA further difficulty with the 470 is that it does not run on a Sunday so our suggestions for the 470 are to increase the frequency from once every half an hour, run it on Sundays and (see below) extend it to Epsom hospital.\nThe X26 bus to Heathrow is used by many and the increased frequency of the X26 is welcome, but the buses have difficulty in keeping to the timetable, perhaps because of the length of the route. Some residents say they would not use it if travelling to Heathrow to catch a plane as it is not 100% reliable. There may thus be a case for increasing the frequency further.\nRoute length – could the 470 go to Epsom hospital rather than Epsom market as there are residents who use it to go to the hospital?\nOn route 151, the frequency and reliability is generally good but the service could be improved if some rush hour buses turned round at North Cheam, bearing in mind that the 213 duplicates the 151 onwards to Worcester Park.\nTimetabling – it is noted that the 80 and 280 buses running northwards along Brighton Road frequently arrive at the same time. Could the timetabling be looked at?\nPassenger information – it has been pointed out that the two bus stops in Mulgrave Road close to Sutton station do not include digital displays on bus arrival information. Although there are other ways of getting this information, on your mobile phone, not all passengers have the skill to get this.\nA review of the information arrangements was suggested for some routes. On route 164, at some stops the bus is recorded as a minute away or due but it does not turn up for six or seven minutes.\nOther matters – There has often been comment on arrangements at Sutton station. A resident suggested that congestion in Mulgrave Roadcould be alleviated by moving the taxi rank. It would be possible to move it to The Quadrant now the side entrance to the station is open, but this would probably be unpopular with the taxi drivers and railway passengers, and was not a proposal pursued under the Sutton Gateway project. A resident also commented that this part of Mulgrave Road has on occasions been briefly flooded during very heavy downpours. I have asked Council engineers to investigate.\nA summary of these comments, by bus route, is:\n470 – increase the frequency from once every half an hour, run it on Sundays and extend it to Epsom hospital\n151 – the service could be improved if some rush hour buses turned round at North Cheam, bearing in mind that the 213 duplicates the 151 onwards to Worcester Park\n80 and 280 – buses running northwards along Brighton Road frequently arrive at the same time so review the timetabling\n164 – review the information arrangements as at some stops the bus is recorded as a minute away or due but it does not turn up for six or seven minutes\nS1 – review the way the timetable is set out on the website\nS4 – review the frequency.\nIt should be noted that while this summary is focussed on suggesting improvements, many residents have commented to us in favourable terms on the frequency and reliability of local bus services.\nWe have put this digest of views forward to officers for consideration. Any decision rests, of course, with Transport for London.",

  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_2013_06_27_how-is-sutton-surviving-the-recession/content_597.html": "The latest data continue to show that Sutton is surviving the recession well.\nThey show that average house prices in Sutton (as measured by the average price of houses in Sutton sold in any particular month) were up almost 1% in February of this year compared to the previous month, and stood at 4.2% above the figure for a year previously. The cost of the average house sold in February, the latest month for which reliable data are available, was £255 000. This bullishness in the housing market is generally taken as an indicator of confidence in the local economy.\nPositive indicators include:\nThe economic activity rate of working age adults in Sutton, at 81%, continues to be well above the average for London, which is 76%. Sutton residents continue to find work, and the percentage has increased (by 0.5%) in the last year. Many residents commute to central London for work, and it is unsurprising that the average pay of employees working in Sutton (£519 a week) is less than that in central London.\nThis finding, that Sutton residents continue to find work, is supported by the decline in numbers claiming Job Seekers Allowance, down by 7% in March compared to the figure for a year previously.\nThat said, the number of people who have been collecting JSA for over a year has risen in the last year, suggesting that those who have become distanced from the labour market are finding it more difficult to get work. Richard says this mirrors what he finds, as a local Councillor, in his casework, with people made redundant in their 50’s often finding it hard to get back into work.\nThis suggests that the Council’s “Opportunity Sutton” programme is an important priority. Jobs are gold dust and the prosperity of the Borough depends on people finding and staying in work.\nNew business start ups were at a record level in Sutton in 2012, with 863 new companies formed.\nThe number of local companies going into administration was down in the most recent quarter (January to March) and down on figures for a year previously.\nThe data that comes to the Housing, Economy and Business Committee usually shows a mixed picture, but the latest data are mostly encouraging. One negative that concerns us is that enquiries to Sutton’s Citizens’ Advice Bureau were up by about 5% in the last quarter, with debt advice enquiries increasing by 8.8%. Richard has said his piece, at Sutton Council meetings, about the problem of “payday” loans and we cannot see why it is impossible to have a maximum figure for the interest charged on these loans (it can be over 1000% APR) imposed in law. Richard’s comments are included in a separate post on this site on this subject.\nThis information is analysed by Richard in his role as vice-chair of the Council’s Housing, Economy and Business Committee, which has oversight of economic development matters and the “Opportunity Sutton” programme. This is currently generating projects involving over £90 million worth of investment in Sutton, including the “Sutton Gateway” project to develop and improve the area from Sutton Court to the station. We hope this will include improving and opening up the side entrance to Sutton station, better shops and restaurants, new jobs from office development, more housing as Sutherland House is developed, the relocation of the recycling bins at The Quadrant and a general tidying up of the area.",
  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_2012_08_09_on-your-side/content_433.html": "As active Councillors, we are continually taking up problems brought to us by local residents. It gives a warm feeling if we can solve the problem.\nTwo recent examples illustrate the range of issues we deal with. A disabled resident at Fiske Court in Cavendish Road has had the problem that she parks her mobility car, which she depends on to get around, in the “disabled” parking bay outside Fiske Court. This is right under a lime tree and the sap means the car gets very dirty. She is unable to wash the car herself due to her disability and has to get it washed frequently, which is expensive in terms of time and money. We have now got the bay moved so it is no longer under the lime tree.\nThe other example is more problematic. We were alerted by residents to problems with the waste bins at Grosvenor Court in the Brighton Road. This is not the first time there have been such problems. Grosvenor Court is a large block of mansion flats above a row of shops and restaurants in Regent Parade. A set of waste bins at the back of Regent Parade are used by both the businesses and by residents. However, the businesses have their own bins for trade waste. There have been instances when the trade waste has wound up in the bins meant for residents and the volume has meant there has been a dreadful problem of overflowing rubbish.\nThe most recent problem seemed to arise from one of the businesses in Regent Parade putting its trade waste in bins that were not for this waste. We arranged for the Council’s enforcement team to make an inspection and they concluded that due to the failure of previous attempts to encourage the owner to manage his waste in a responsible manner they would issue a Fixed Penalty Notice. We hope that this will be enough to prevent this issue from re-occurring in the future. Everyone is sorry that things reached this point, but it seemed that the problem would not go away unless it became clear that action would be taken, and it important people know that as active local Councillors we will prompt the Council to take action to protect the interests of residents when problems like this occur.",
  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_public-art-in-sutton-south/content_46.html": "There are several important pieces of public art in our Ward.\nThe Messenger is a statue, a sculpture in bronze with very dark patination, completed by David Wynne in 1981, of a large horse and rider. The horse, with a slightly raised left leg, looks towards the railway station. The rider, seated bareback, raises his left hand in the air above his head and his right hand to his mouth, as if calling. It is fully life-size and mounted on a high (7 foot) plinth of marble and granite slabs. The total height is 150 inches. It was a major commission for the sculptor, which took four years to complete from his first idea and inspiration, on receipt of the brief – through roughing out, refining and casting in a foundry, to the final unveiling and installation. The sculpture is located directly outside the main entrance to Quadrant House in the Quadrant. Quadrant House is currently an empty and redundant office block due for re-development, but we are confident any re-development will include retention of the statue.\nEven more striking is the remarkable mural by the famous Spanish “street” artist from Bilbao, Eva Mena, on a wall in Wellesley Road. This is said to be of the American singer and musician Erykah Badu. The work was commissioned by the owners of the building, Indepth Hygiene Services. It was painted in three days in 2010, when the artist came over from Spain to paint it. It is entirely typical of her street art, which is to be found on walls in many parts of the world, including Egypt, Ireland and Spain, as well as Sutton.\nThere are five structures of some historic significance in our Ward.\nMost people are aware that historic buildings might be “listed” to prevent their being inappropriately developed or demolished. This is, however, a national system, and local authorities can prepare lists of local structures that are of significance locally though not grand enough to go on the national list.\nThere are two structures in Sutton South Ward that are of such significance, historically and architecturally, that they make the national list, and there are three others on the local list.\nThe five structures in Sutton South Ward are:\n- the Registrar’s office (The Russetings) in Worcester Road, a Victorian house that it is believed the Walls family, famous for Walls ice cream and Walls sausages, lived in, though this is disputed\n- Stowford in Brighton Road, a Victorian house, now the Eagle House school\n- the pavilion of the Highfield Lawns tennis club at the junction of Mayfield Road and The Ridgway, as an example of an Edwardian tennis pavilion, build by local builder Percy Vere Windebank in 1908\n- a milestone dating from 1745 in Brighton Road, close to Westmoreland Drive. This is a nationally listed structure\n- a Victorian sewer vent pipe in Hillcroome Road, one of 24 in the area, manufactured at an ironworks (W. Macfarlane and Co.) in Glasgow and erected when mains sewerage came to the area in the nineteenth century. This is also a nationally listed structure.\nThe most unusual and interesting of these is the sewer vent pipe, pictured below.\nThis is one of a number of Drain Pressure Release Pipes, also known as ‘Stink Pipes’, that can be seen at various locations within the old Carshalton Urban District Council boundary. It is the only one in our Ward. They have been listed on the basis of the criterion that they are important to the townscape view.\nThey were produced by W. Macfarlane & Co. of Glasgow, a prestigous Victorian Ironworks. The company employed imaginative designers and produced huge amounts of ornate and decorative ironwork. The pipes are extremely tall with an ornate top fixture comprising a large arrow, a globe with four trumpetlike funnels and a spike spire piercing a crown. The height and funnels may be to ensure the gas disperses efficiently so as not to inconvenience local residents. It is not known what purpose the arrow has, whether to indicate the direction of sewer flow or act as a weather vane to indicate wind direction.\nThey serve two purposes, firstly to prevent a build up of pressure in underground sewers in the event of a blockage, and secondly to vent off any hydrogen sulphide gas. This gas, which smells of rotten eggs, can build up when sewage becomes septic, on long runs, or when the speed of the sewage is slow in flat areas. It is extremely corrosive and can eat through the concrete pipes. The sewerage system would have become a necessity after the rapid increases in population and residences in Sutton and Carshalton at the end of the 1800s. Prior to this sewage would have been dispersed into cesspits and drainage ditches, with a risk of contamination of the drinking water supply, contributing to ill health.\nThe history of W. Macfarlane and Co. and their foundry, the Saracen Foundry, is fascinating. In 1851 Walter Macfarlane (1817-1885) established his company in a disused foundry in Saracen Lane in Gallowgate, Glasgow, and named it Saracen Foundry. It later moved to Washington Street, near the River Clyde. By 1872 his nephew, also named Walter MacFarlane (1853–1932), joined the rapidly expanding company and they relocated to Possilpark, a site of 100 acres on the outskirts of the city. Here a foundry with railway access and a village-styled infrastructure to house the workforce was built. In a decade it housed 10,000 people but the vast iron-founding site caused much pollution. The young MacFarlane made standardisation and good design the key to the company’s successful development. The foundry’s work was used on prestigous developments and widely distributed. During the Second World War Possilpark industrial works was a vast and well-lit target for attack. The recovery of iron to melt down for the war effort also removed much of Saracen’s work. After the war, the collapse of the British Empire, the move away from steam power and the use of new designs and materials led to a vast decline in orders. In 1967 the foundry at Possilpark closed.\nIn considering the history of the Ward, it is appropriate to mention Harold Berridge, a famous engineer who lived in the road next to the Subsea7 building off Brighton Road, now named after him – Berridge Close.\nThe photo shows Trish and Richard at the opening of the re-named Berridge Close in 2016.\nThis is to remember Harold Berridge (1872-1949), a celebrated engineer who lived in a house on the site now occupied by the Subsea7 offices, from the 1920s through to 1949. Berridge was an engineer who travelled the world and contributed to many important civil engineering projects worldwide, including the building of tunnels under the river Hudson in New York in 1902 and the development of the port of Aden – in modern day Yemen – in the ensuing decade. He settled in Sutton in the 1920’s to work on housing development for the London County Council. He is noted in civil engineering circles as the inventor of equipment for the testing of concrete, based on principles which are still relevant to modern day equipment used for this purpose.\nHarold Berridge was born in 1872 and went to the City of London school. After serving a pupilage in civil engineering from 1890 to 1893 he became the resident engineer at Poole Harbour in 1893.\nAfter working as an engineer for companies including John Mowlem & Co. and the City and South London Railway in the period to 1898, he became Assistant Superintendent supervising the approaches to the Hudson Tunnel, in New York, in 1902, before becoming Chief Engineer to the Aden Port Trust in 1904. He was involved in work in Aden through to 1924, after which he worked on housing development schemes for the London County Council through to 1931. During his time in Aden he was awarded the OBE.\nThe Times of 20 June 1949 reports his death, on 17 June 1949, at 8 Worcester Gardens, Sutton, Surrey. Worcester Gardens stood on the site now occupied by the Subsea7 building in Brighton Road, and was a turning off the Brighton Road. Berridge lived in a Victorian house in Worcester Gardens.\nBerridge is remembered for his patents relating to principles and equipment for the testing of concrete, including one dating from 1925 under the title “Contractible and expansible supporting means suitable for use in the construction of pipes, tunnels, bridges and other bodies or structures.” In 1932 he submitted an important patent entitled ”Apparatus for Testing the Strength of Materials.” His equipment for the testing of concrete was based on principles which are still relevant to modern day equipment used for this purpose.\nThere are several houses in our Ward that were once occupied by prominent and, at the time, well-known figures, and whose memory is commemorated by one of the Sutton “burgundy plaques.”\nThese are:\n- a plaque remembering Graham Sutherland, the artist, on a house in Upland Road\n- a plaque remembering H.G. Wells, the author, on a house in Langley Park Road\n- a plaque remembering the Walls family, famous for Walls pork sausages and Walls ice cream, on The Russetings in Worcester Road (shown above).\nThere is some dispute as to whether The Russetings was in fact the home of the Walls family.\nOne of the most interesting people who once lived in Sutton South Ward is Rudi Vrba (1926-2006), who lived for a period after the second world war at flat 13 Eaton Court in Eaton Road. Vrba was a Slovak Jew who escaped from Auschwitz and was instrumental in alerting the world as to what was going on in Germany, in terms of the treatment of Jews. There is a campaign led by the Guardian journalist Jonathan Freedland, who has written a biography of Rudi Vrba, and by Richard Clifton, to honour his memory with one of the English Heritage blue plaques on the building. This cannot be progressed, under the rules established by English Heritage, before twenty years after his death, which means not until 26 March 2026.\nThe railway bridge at Sutton station has been brightened up with a painting by the renowned artist Lionel Stanhope, whose art has brightened up many railway stations.\nThe façade of the railway bridge, as you come out of Sutton station and turn left, was a patchwork of various colours. The Council first tried to interest Network Rail in making the bridge look more attractive, some years ago, during the “Sutton Gateway” project, which involved re-paving the area around the station and the installation of the clock opposite Sutton station.\nThe parapet of the bridge required extensive cleaning and preparation before painting commenced. Lionel Stanhope produced a design which incorporated the word “Sutton” in the typeface traditionally used by Southern railway, and a depiction of the historic Sutton locomotive. The locomotive “Sutton” came into the possession of the Council many years ago and is a 144 year old, 28 tonne, 26 feet, A1 class Terrier steam engine. It is currently with a heritage railway undertaking in Tunbridge Wells who have undertaken to restore it.\nThe work was jointly funded by Network Rail and Sutton Council. The painting is an addition to an area becoming famous for its street art. Within two hundred yards you can find the remarkable statue “The Messenger”, described above, and the remarkable mural by the famous Spanish “street” artist from Bilbao, Eva Mena, on a wall in nearby Wellesley Road, also described above.\nAs the artwork is not easy to photograph, the picture above is the CGI prepared before the painting was undertaken.\nThe other nationally listed structure in the Ward is the milestone on Brighton Road, close to Westmoreland Drive. There are three milestones in the Borough of Sutton dating from 1745. They are exactly a mile apart and stand in Rose Hill Park, at the bottom of the High Street and in Brighton Road close to Westmoreland Drive.\nThe Brighton Road stone is eroded and difficult to read, but on the front face of the stone facing Brighton Road it is inscribed “XIII miles from the Standard at Cornhill London 1745.”\nCornhill was a water pump at a junction of roads in London which had been used as the measuring point from London since the 16th century.\nIn 1745, London Bridge was the only bridge across the Thames and the stones marked the route from London to Banstead Downs, for horse racing. At this time there was no road, just a muddy track impassable in the winter months .\nBrighton Road was then called Sandy Lane. There are eight stones surviving along this route from London to Banstead Downs including the three in Sutton, which are all listed monuments. In 1755 the Turnpike Trusts were set up to improve the roads and to collect tolls. With the rise of Brighton as a health resort stage coaches began to run, later in the century, between London and Brighton. The stones then marked the London to Brighton stage coach road.\nThe stones have been lifted and re-carved several times. First, in 1755 Westminster\nBridge was opened and the stones were re-carved with new destinations of Whitehall and Royal Exchange. A map in 1888 shows the Brighton Road milestone as listing Cornhill 13 miles and Westminster Bridge 12 miles. The stones were lifted and re-carved again in the Victorian era in order to change the Roman numerals to modern (Arabic) numbering so that they could show half miles. There is a photograph of the High Street milestone which says Whitehall 11 1/2 miles. At the bottom of the right flank of the Brighton Road milestone there is an inscription “J Parrott Sutton 1892”. This is believed to date from\nthe Victorian re-carving.\nThird, the milestones were defaced and lifted again in 1940 under an order from the Ministry of Transport relating to the removal of road signs during the war in case of invasion. The stones were restored after the war with, in respect of the Rose Hill and High Street milestones, the inscriptions of Whitehall and Royal Exchange and the miles shown in Roman numerals. However, the Brighton Road milestone was restored by a private donation from Mr Ely of Ely’s Department Store in Wimbledon. The stone stood outside his villa in the Brighton Road (since demolished and replaced by flats). Mr Ely chose to restore the stone with the original historic Cornhill inscription, 13 miles to the standard at Cornhill.\nA project is underway to display the milestone to better effect, with the milestone enclosed by railings and a plaque giving the history, like the milestone in the High Street.\n[…] Public Art in Sutton South Some of our ward’s best public artwork […]",

The Borough dubbed the plans a ‘recipe for disaster’ which will split communities, hit house prices and do nothing to encourage economic growth.\nIt is understood that next week’s Lib Dem Conference in Brighton will call on the Coalition to reject the proposal, arguing that current planning laws do not block development. It will also argue that the proposal goes against the spirit of localism and it will encourage more neighbourhood disputes.\nRichard says “The motion we adopted at our Council meeting last October, on which I spoke, went in a different direction. I believe current planning law is quite reasoanable in requiring that a proposed extension is examined to see if it will harm neighbours or the envirnoment. I would like to see plannng law strengthened not weakened.”\nCouncillor Ruth Dombey, Leader of Sutton Council, said: “These proposals are a recipe for disaster. They have not been properly thought through.”\nThe proposal came from Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, Eric Pickles, earlier this month. He issued a nine-point plan entitled ‘Housing and Growth’ in which he announced a relaxation of planning rules for the construction industry and owners of homes and businesses in England. So far the proposals are not law and there is no White Paper. In the absence of such laws Sutton Council is warning businesses and homeowners to think twice before building an extension without checking if planning permission is required.\nIf the proposals did become law, owners of mid-terrace homes could find their rear windows flanked by six metre extensions on both sides, plunging them into darkness for most of the day – and they would have no opportunity to object. Developers could be allowed to bypass council planning controls to “fast-track” commercial and housing applications. Offices would be permitted to convert to residential use all without planning permission, irrespective of this impact they will have on a neighbourhood.\nCllr Dombey added: “If this is allowed to happen it will set neighbour against neighbour and split communities for years to come. On top of the resentment and loss of quality of life, some people’s houses will also plummet in value if they’ve got no light or a noisy factory is within a few metres of their front door.”\nThe Chair of the Housing, Economy and Business Committee, Councillor Jayne McCoy, said “There is no evidence that this will do anything to promote economic growth and I strongly advise that anyone considering a project seeks advice, otherwise it could prove very costly.”",

It is also introducing special provisions to help carers and those undertaking childcare who are regular visitors.\nThe general nature of the Order is, to support the Council’s Parking Strategy and policy to cut carbon emissions in the Borough, to link the charges for parking permits in the controlled parking zones to the CO2 emissions of the vehicle for which the permit is issued; and also to introduce the facility to purchase carer and childcare permits for use in the zones. The impact will be to reduce charges for the least polluting vehicles and increase them for some others, and facilitate carers and those with regular childcare responsibilities to park in the zone.\nYou can find the proposals at\nwww.sutton.gov.uk/trafficpublicnotices\nclicking on “view our Permanent Traffic Order Consultations” and “Notices of Proposals”\nReference PP1035 – CPZ permit charge changes linked to CO2 emissions and carer permits\nComments are invited by 31 August.\nRichard has commented on the proposals that he would like to see a differential scheme imposed for diesel vehicles as they do not emit excessive CO2 compared to other vehicles but do emit other harmful particulates.",

  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_page_13/content_545.html": "On 20 November Sutton Council debated the subject of homelessness.\nThis is the text of Richard’s speech.\n“During my year as Mayor I was continually struck with admiration for the massive contribution to Sutton made by volunteers. Volunteers for a great range of organisations, and in particular volunteers for organisations like Nightwatch, like the Street Pastors, like Sutton Community Works, and like the food banks, all of whom are dedicated to helping the poorest and most dispossessed in our society.\nBut I could never escape from a feeling that in a rational and caring society organisations like the food banks and those providing in effect soup kitchens and advice for rough sleepers and those with no resources, like Nightwatch, would not exist. They would have no clients. How is it that in an affluent society like Britain we are such an unequal society that we have people in such poverty that they need food banks to feed themselves and they lose the roof over their heads, reduced at worst to rough sleeping, at best to the local authority finding them emergency bed and breakfast accommodation probably some miles from Sutton.\nThis would be an entirely academic observation were it not for the fact that this problem is not diminishing, it is increasing. Not just in Sutton, but nationally.\nThe statistics for Sutton show that in April of 2015 the number of homeless households the Council had placed in temporary accommodation stood at 280, a year later it was 411, last week it stood at 581. But it is not a Sutton problem, it is a national problem. It is everywhere.\nAs a Councillor I have found increasing casework concerning families given notice to quit and that the Council then has to place in emergency accommodation often miles from their roots, miles from the schools their children attend, miles from their employment in Sutton. In one recent case I dealt with this eviction appeared to be largely because the family had complained to the landlord about the all pervading damp in the flat.\nWhat can be done to turn the tide ? What local authorities and volunteers like Nightwatch can do is no more than picking up the pieces. The Council has the difficult task of finding accommodation. When I was Chair of Planning Committee three years ago one of the decisions we took, controversial at the time and I recollect it was not without opposition, was to convert the Oakleigh home to be a hostel for families in need of emergency accommodation. But we would need many more Oakleighs now just to meet the increase in that need since that time.\nThe failure here, leading to the problem escalating, is a failure of policy. It is the welfare and housing policies of central Government that are failing to address the problem and leading to its escalation.\nI could spend a long time detailing these failures – the bearing down on those already in poverty through the benefits freeze and through changes to support of those unable to work due to disability and illness, the introduction of Universal Credit in a way that is most concerned to save money, the loss of the Council’s stock of social housing due to the right to buy, the decline nationally in the construction of new Council houses and affordable homes, which we are trying to address here in Sutton with our ambitious programme to build the first new Council homes in 30 years. Changes to the Local Housing Allowance. The loopholes in planning law that enable developers such as those who refurbished Northumberland House in my Ward to evade requirements to provide any affordable homes atall. The list goes on. It is part of a war on what my generation cherished as the welfare state.\nMy colleague Councillor Fivey, who sadly cannot be here tonight, has had discussions with Nightwatch since the organisation was formed and assisted in their obtaining £586.13 from the Council through the Neighbourhood Grant programme to pay for the tent, a gazebo, from which they operate three nights a week in our Ward, providing food and help to rough sleepers and others without resources. Current discussions about the best practical further help for Nightwatch, and other organisations, will continue.\nWe all support the work of Nightwatch but there is no logic in expressing our support for organisations like Nightwatch while not mentioning what should be done to stop these problems occurring in the first place, which is to change Government policy.”",

Like all London boroughs we have had to deal with the bulge in pupil numbers. This has gone through the primary school system and our excellent local primary schools in this area have been able to cope, with most parents still getting their first choice of school. Many secondary schools in Sutton have expanded, including our popular local school Overton Grange, but two new secondary schools will still be needed and are planned. The new Harris Academy, integrated into the Sutton Cancer Hub development, is already proving popular with parents who plan to apply for places next year.

Thank you. We now want to build up Lib Dem support in the ward and increase our number of councillors to three next time. It is very important that we keep our Ward members in touch with what we are both doing and find out what you think we can all do to make Sutton South an even better place to live in. Being a Councillor is not a job for slouches! The few paragraphs below give you a sample of what’s been going on.\nPolice\nAlthough crime is statistically low in our area, on a number of occasions we have met local police from the Sutton South Safer Neighbourhood Team to discuss what to do about the drug dealing that has been taking place outside some blocks of flats; “street drinkers” congregating near Forest Dene on Cedar Road, and about serious instances of anti social behaviour affecting a number of residents in social housing. Some significant proposals are under discussion. We are of course in touch with our local Neighbourhood Watch scheme.\nPlanning\nRichard is becoming something of a planning expert! He has spoken several times at the Development Control Committee on planning applications that have worried residents, and attended Planning Inspectorate hearings on appeals concerning planning decisions affecting the Ward. One concerned a nursing home in Mayfield Road, where the owner breached planning conditions. Another concerned the prospect of additional noise and disturbance for residents of Grosvenor Court in the Brighton Road from a proposed pizza takeaway which planned to use six motorbikes to deliver pizzas.\nOpen Spaces\nAlthough Sutton is renowned for its delightful green open spaces, there is only one such area in Sutton South, the nature reserve in Devonshire Road. After we discovered that 50 per cent of children in Devonshire School do not have the use of a garden, we’ve been working to improve this area, but without detracting from its purpose and basic informal character.\nIn collaboration with LibDem Councillors in Carshalton Central we are forming a Friends of Warren Park group, a much loved park on the borders of this ward. Do let us know if you are interested in being involved.\nLocal Schools\nWe have been talking to residents and head teachers about the Council’s proposals to increase the intake and expand the buildings at both Devonshire and Barrow Hedges Primary Schools. Expansion is needed because the number of young children has increased in the borough. Both Head Teachers support the proposals and see them improving standards. It should now become easier for our local parents to get their children into these popular and successful schools. But we will be watching to make sure that the expansions are well managed, to meet the concerns of some parents at Barrow Hedges about issues such as parking.\nWe visited Overton Grange School to discuss road safety concerns with the Head Master. Following this visit council officials have come forward with proposed improvements, which we support.\nRubbish etc\nRubbish remains a problem. Some local residents are vigilant in tackling this unhealthy and unpleasant eye sore. We have been addressing the issue of rubbish at the side of Sutherland House and Richard as dealt with problems about rubbish disposal at Grosvenor Court.\nOther issues we have taken up include blocked drains, potholes, grit bins, noise in flats, the pruning of trees and replacing trees damaged by cars in Copse Hill.\nSutton Housing Partnership\nWith staff from Sutton Housing Partnership, we have visited a number of properties that they manage in this ward to identify necessary remedial work to the buildings. More visits are planned. We believe that our concern about the state of the ball court at Sutton Court has revived plans for its improvement, which are now being pursued.\nMeetings, Meetings and More Meetings!\nAside from this, we are both members of several Council committees, including the Health and Wellbeing Scrutiny Committee, the Health and Safety Committee (which Richard chairs) and the Audit Committee. Heather is a member of the Smarter Sutton Services Steering Group, looking at strategies to transform planned expenditure reductions into an opportunity to improve efficiency and services. She has already made her maiden speech at a Council meeting\nLocal Action\nWe both sit on the Sutton South, Belmont and Cheam Local Committee. This has previously been entirely Conservative controlled. Most residents are unaware of the committee which provides small amounts of funding for local capital projects. We need to make this committee work better. Please come and take part.",

A resident suggested this was about the point where someone walking back from the station with a takeaway snack would finish it and drop rubbish.\nRe-surfacing of Hillcroome Road to deal with potholes after the hard winter of 2009/2010.\nImprovements to the layout of the Brighton Road at the junction with Ventnor Road and Devonshire Avenue, to reduce road accidents.\nImprovements made in relation to signage and road markings outside Overton Grange school due to concerns about road safety when students leave the school at the end of the day. A new, flashing “wig wag” sign (it flashes when switched on at about the time students arrive at or leave school) erected.\nThis is the “wig wag” sign.\nExpansion of Devonshire Avenue, The Avenue and Barrow Hedges primary schools will make it easier for Sutton South parents to get their children into these excellent, popular and frequently over-subscribed schools. We also succeeded in moving the polling stations from Devonshire and Barrow Hedges schools to local church halls, so the education of the children will not be disrupted for a day and related child care problems can be avoided.\nExtension of the “No Drinking Zone” into Sutton South Ward, to deal with issues of anti-social behaviour associated with a group of “all day drinkers” who tend to congregate on the corner of Cedar Road and Brighton road, the location shown in this picture.\nRepresentations made by your local Liberal Democrat Councillors to contribute to Sutton-wide response to Transport for London consultation on the future of the X26 Croydon to Heathrow service, the 80 service from Sutton station to Belmont and the 280 Tooting to Belmont service, to stress the importance to local people of these services.\nSupport for the creation of more “car club” bays in Sutton South Ward, such as this bay in Albion Road which was identified for conversion to a “car club” bay, in order to encourage better car use, reducing pollution, a “greener” Borough and policy on sustainable transport. This proposal is currently on hold but Car2go have expanded their car club service in the Ward.\nNew street trees planted, such as this one in Copse Hill. And in Copse Hill we also intervened to get Council officials to look at the potential for a flooding problem at the foot of the hill, with the cleaning out of the soakaways and other improvements.\nAction to improve the Devonshire Avenue Nature Area, involving, amongst other things, re-positioning the benches, partially removing a wall that divides up the site, possibly fencing some areas with low wooden fencing to protect the kidney vetch essential for the small blue buterfly, removing the corrugated iron sheeting found at the site and installing a small piece of play equipment for children aged 5 to 7 at the entrance, while taking action to control the habitat. The reserve is the only open space in the Ward. We have supported only limited installation of play equipment as we believe the area should continue to be a nature reserve, and our proposals are designed to ensure the habitat of the area will not be harmed. We are promoting a programme to assist the small blue butterfly.\nAction to improve the safety of pedestrians who pass under the railway bridge in Grange Vale. There is a narrow pavement and, as it is a one-way street, cars roar round the corner from the Brighton Road end and under the bridge, the driver only seeing a pedestrian on the pavement under the bridge at the last moment. This is a particular problem for parents with buggies or with small children passing under the bridge against the direction of traffic. A barrier and set of posts have been erected to slow the traffic.\nThis photo shows the improvement made.\nAction taken to discuss with BT the installation of the new generation of very large green cabinets at locations in the Ward, to ensure they are put in locations that do not cause annoyance to residents, as this box in Cedar Road does. Action to prevent the boxes being covered with unsightly advertising.\nAction to promote the sensitive re-development of Sutherland House, which is currently an eyesore, and to ensure that if it is re-developed there will be gains for the residents of the Ward through a programme of improvements funded by the developer, through the community infrastructure levy and section 106 contributions.\nAction to get the Edwardian tennis pavilion in Mayfield Road included on the Sutton Local List as a building of significant local historical importance and interest.\nCampaign launched to stop Thameslink services being terminated at Blackfriars, something that would lead to dispersion of commuters onto other services that are already packed, cut Sutton off from St. Pancras International and north London, and harm the attractiveness of Sutton to companies locating their offices away from but close to central London.\nA programe of road maintenence throughout the Ward – this picture shows line painting in Eaton Road.\nThe side entrance at Sutton station\nOur campaign continues to get the side entrance to Sutton station opened. A bid submitted by Sutton Council for funding from the Mayor’s Outer London Fund was not successful, but the campaign continues and a further bid (to TfL) has been successful. This is not the end of the story as negotiations continue on matched funding..\nWe succeeded in getting the date for the four-yearly pruning of the thousand or so street trees in Sutton South Ward brought forward to the end of 2011. We have also got commitment to an interim look at the state of the trees, outside the normal four year cycle, in 2014.",

This was after the meeting of the consultative panel for our Ward arranged for Wednesday 14 March was called off due a shortage of available police personnel.\nWe both sit on the panel, which is a vehicle for consultation with the community about police priorities and is also a mechanism for the community to help the police. More information about the panel is available on the page on “Sutton Police”.\nThe text of our letter to Sutton’s senior police officers was as follows:\n“To Superintendant Phil Willis, Head of SPSS\nChief Inspector Alan Chambers\nDear Colleagues\nThe scheduled police consultative panel meeting that was due to take place tonight in Sutton South Ward of the London Borough of Sutton has been postponed by the police.\nCouncillor Heather Honour and I, the two Liberal Democrat Councillors for the Ward, are concerned at this cancellation, which appears to be due to problems related to police resources. I am writing to you to express our concern and to seek re-assurance that there are not going to be longer term problems with the policing of our Ward.\nThe Sutton South Ward Safer Neighbourhoods policing team used to have its own sergeant. Last year that was taken away from us, when the long-serving Dave Williams retired, and a single segeant was appointed to cover both Belmont and Sutton South. We did not protest at this, since analysis we regularly carry out of crime trends in Sutton South compared to the rest of the Borough show it is a low crime area, and Belmont Ward has similarly low figures. Sergeant Brendan Mcwilliams was appointed.\nSince then there has been a continuous pattern of change. Sergeant McWilliams is now leaving us and we find that the resources of the team are almost continuously depleted by training and by officers being deployed away from the area to help with operations elsewhere. This depletion is the reason we have been given as to why it is not possible to hold the scheduled meeting of the panel thisevening.\nWe fully appreciate that there are times when local resources have to be offered up to assist in wider policing exercises, and recognise that as the Olympics approach this may happen more often. However, we would be concerned if our area was left with so little cover that normal policing tasks for the community were put at risk, and if this were to impact on crime levels.\nWe would welcome your reaction to these concerns and trust you can put our minds at rest.\nBest wishes.\nRichard Clifton\nCouncillor for Sutton South Ward”",
  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_author_richardclifton_page_18/content_843.html": "At the meeting of Sutton Council on 23 May, when the new Mayor is elected and the membership of committees are changed, Trish and Richard took on new responsibilities. Trish continues a s a member of the Housing, Economy and Business Committee, is elected to the Standards Committee, and will sit on the Merton and Sutton Joint Cemetery Board. Richard stands down as chair of Planning Committee and is elected Mayor for the next year.\nHere is the text of Richard’s acceptance speech.\n“I have during the six years that I have been a member of this Council served under five Mayors, three of whom are currently members of the Council. All of them did the job with great distinction. Gloria and I will do our best to continue in that tradition.\nI have many people to thank, but can I particularly thank our musicians. My good friends John, George, Rachel, Stephen and Andrew. When I was first elected to the Council there was a tradition of having some music during the natural interval that occurs in the middle of these annual meetings. It somehow lapsed but I was determined to revive it with – of course – brass musical instruments.\nLast year there was a review of the functions of the Mayor. The review report noted the long tradition in the cities, towns and boroughs of our country of the office of a Mayor, and in London the history can be traced back to 1189. But the report included proposals to bring the Mayor of Sutton into the 21st. century by promoting the Mayor through, and I quote the report, “twitter, facebook and a Mayoral blog on the Council’s website.” I hope this will become required reading for all of you and I will try to find something interesting or amusing to say each week, and you can give me marks out of ten.\nOf course, these different Mayors, stretching back to 1189, had a wide variety of ceremonial and policy functions. The promotion of charities to aid those less fortunate in life is however a recurring theme throughout, and a role of the Mayor that continues, which brings me to the subject of charities. I am pleased to be able to tell you of the two charities I propose we support this year.\nThese are Sutton Shopmobility and the Altzheimer’s Society. The Altzheimer’s society has a strong presence in Sutton and the Council has worked hard on the theme of being a dementia friendly organisation. I have a personal interest as both of my late parents had severe dementia late in life and were cared for by family members who were greatly helped by the society. And it is the families and carers who often most need most support.\nShopmobility is probably thought of by many of you as a provider of mobility scooters to help people shop in the town centre, but the organisation has a much wider role and outreach to help all those with mobility problems, and there are many in the borough who would be completely housebound without this help. And we have Councillor Patel’s mobility scooter here to show us how important it is. In the audience tonight are some representatives of the charities and I hope Councillors will want to discuss the work of these charities with them later thisevening.\nI would also like to appeal to all Councillors and indeed to everyone in this room to make a resolution to support the Mayor’s charitable appeal, and support at least one of the Mayor’s charity events this year, to support these worthy organisations.\nNow, finally, I am advised that the Mayor may appoint a Chaplin and I am delighted that the Reverend Justine Middlemiss has agreed to be my Chaplin. Justine covers a number of churches in Sutton including the splendid Victorian church, Christchurch, in my Ward, which has splendid acoustics – as I know from playing the trumpet, a small part in a big band, in the church.\nNow, Justine asked me a very pertinent question when I spoke to her about being the Mayor’s Chaplin. She asked me what do I want a Chaplin for? Well, part of the job description is to give the Mayor spiritual guidance and spiritual uplift. And being as human as everyone else, there are moments I feel a bit down and in need of spiritual uplift. Whether or not I need much spiritual uplift in the next year may depend a bit on you – I am talking to the Councillors now – and on whether you are well behaved and orderly when I come to chair these meetings.\nBut I have an advantage. For the last two years of my life I have chaired Planning Committee. And if there is any one member of the Council who sometimes needs a bit of spiritual uplift it is the chair of Planning Committee. So can I say how delighted I am that a Councillor of the calibre of Councillor Bourne is succeeding me in taking on this portfolio. She will do the job much better than I did. And Sam, if you find, as I did, that from time to time you need a bit of spiritual uplift – I will loan you Justine.\nNow in a moment, if I can dispose of the rest of the agenda with dispatch, and I know Councillors will want to help me do this, we are going to enjoy the traditional reception put on by the incoming Mayor at these annual meetings. This is not a celebration of me, Councillor Patel and Councillor Cooke moving into these positions. It is a celebration we have once a year of the civic traditions of Sutton and our shared commitment to public service to the benefit of our residents. We know that there are sometimes pointed exchanges across the floor of the Council but there is much more that unites all of us in this room than that divides us. It is a mutual respect and a mutual belief that we all share in the virtues of public service, we would not be Councillors unless we had that shared belief, and tonight I would like you to share with me a celebration of these virtues.\nThat concludes my remarks under item 5, except to say it is a great honour to be elected Mayor of the borough. I am deeply touched. Gloria and I will do everything to repay the trust you have shown in us. It will be a great year for all of us, and I sincerely thank you.”",

Richard is to chair the new Audit and Governance Committee while Trish is a member of the important Housing, Economy and Business Committee. Steve Cook, who was Deputy Mayor when Richard was Mayor in 2016, was elected Mayor. Richard moved the nomination. This is his speech.\n“Madame Mayor, I wanted to begin my remarks by echoing what many others have said about the grace, dignity, hard work and commitment you have brought, with Councillor Heron, to the Mayoralty this year.\nSo let me turn now to another Councillor who, I know, will bring commitment and hard work to the Mayoralty in this coming year, if Council accepts my nomination tonight.\nIt gives me great pleasure to nominate, to be Mayor of the London Borough of Sutton for the year 2018-19, Councillor Steve Cook.\nI cannot resist beginning by saying that if you do accept this nomination it will be the second time in three years that the Mayor of Sutton has been a Muswell Hillbilly, as Steve and I discovered we share a common birthplace, a maternity hospital (sadly later demolished) in Alexandra Park Road in Muswell Hill, in north London. And for those too young to recognise the reference, “I’m a Muswell Hillbilly” is a song made famous by The Kinks pop group, who hail from Muswell Hill, and famous Muswell Hillbillies include Steve and myself, obviously, Ray and Dave Davies of The Kinks, Adam Ant and Alvin Stardust – so a really distinguished company of people.\nLet me tell you about Steve. Steve was born on the Queen’s coronation day, so every birthday is the anniversary of the Coronation, of Sir Edmund Hillary climbing Everest and of the D-Day landings.\nHe left school as a teenager after the tragic death of his father and after he had himself suffered a major, life threatening illness. He became a runner in the Soho film business and was such a great success that by the 1980s he had his own large scale, thriving post production studios, in Soho, in London, and in Los Angeles.\nBut Steve is a drummer, and in a particular milieu, Steve is famous, famous for the Steve Cook Soul Band, formed in 1975. The Steve Cook Soul Band was effectively the “house” band at the Grosvenor House Hotel in Park Lane for over twenty years, the industry favourite for charity balls and awards ceremonies, performing at numerous awards and film industry functions.\nI am told that at its height it had 17 members including musicians and go-go dancers.\nThere are many stories about the band. There is a story that in the 1980s they played at the Istanbul Advertising Awards ceremony, followed by a live televised gig at the Istanbul Hilton, and an international incident was narrowly avoided when the skimpily clad go-go dancers were featured on the front page of the Turkish equivalent of the News of the World.\nThe band lasted from 1975 until its last gig in 2010 – 35 glorious years.\nSteve became a Councillor in 2015 after being Chair of the local residents’ association which successfully campaigned against a huge McDonalds drive-through in Wallington.\nNow in some London Boroughs there is a tradition that whoever is Deputy Mayor one year then becomes Mayor the following year. We have not constrained ourselves in that way in Sutton but of course Steve was, with Councillor Patel, Deputy Mayor just over a year ago, so he has the experience to avoid the traps and be a great Mayor. And his wife Pauline, who had a distinguished career in education in Sutton – headteacher at Robin Hood infants school for twenty years and at Thomas Wall Nursery school for eight year – brought great dedication to the role of Deputy Mayoress, and will be an excellent Mayoress.\nMadame Mayor, I nominate Councillor Steve Cook.”",

However, there will be hatching on the road which will have the effect of moving traffic to a more central position.

It will now be held on Tuesday 26 March from 3pm to 9pm in addition to the exhibition on 19 March. Both events will be at the Holiday Inn in Sutton.\nRichard and Heather have had further meetings with Subsea7, and the following is the text of their letter sent to local residents.\n“Since we learned of the proposed redevelopment of the Brighton Road Car Park site, we have been working hard to tackle the parking issues that might arise for residents in Sutton South. Although this is still very much work in progress, we thought it a good time to bring you up to date with what is going on.\nAs you know, the high-tech engineering firm Subsea 7 want to expand their presence in Sutton by building a brand new state-of-the-art Head Quarters for their international business. This may bring up to 500 new jobs.\nThe new building will be much more attractive than the existing Brighton Road Car Park and will be designed by a renowned firm of architects, ESA. It will form part of a renewed “Gateway to Sutton” along the Brighton Road from the South that, in addition to new jobs, will provide extra spending power for local shops, restaurants and hotels.\nKeeping the company in Sutton will also protect over 300 jobs that the company currently have located in the Borough so that they do not move elsewhere.\nSubsea 7 have considered other buildings in Sutton that are currently empty, like Sutherland House, but have found that these are not satisfactory for the needs of an international headquarters.\nThe Council undertook a parking capacity study that showed that Council public car parks are only 53 per cent full during the peak weekday period. This means that there is therefore 47 per cent spare capacity.\nBut the report did not address the specific issue of increased on-road parking in the Highfields area and adjacent roads, including Upland Road and Farm Road. We immediately pointed this out to the Council and were told that its purpose was to ensure that the loss of parking in the Brighton Road Car Park would not damage the town centre’s economy.\nWe have therefore asked for work to be undertaken on the impact on car parking in the Highfields area and adjacent roads. We have also asked for financial incentives to encourage those drivers who currently use the Brighton Road Car Park to go to the Gibson Road Car Park rather than drive up to the area outside the controlled parking zone. These discussions are ongoing.\nWe have discussed with Subsea 7 our concerns about on-road parking in Sutton South and, as part of any planning application, they will be required to submit a traffic impact survey. We have asked that the traffic survey also considers where commuters will park as a result of these changes, And what local impact it will have. The results of this study will then be taken in to account by the Council when it negotiates with Subsea 7 about their financial obligations to the local community. This is part of the normal process with any large planning development.\nThe next steps are as follows:\n- Subsea 7 will hold an exhibition on the proposed development at the Holiday Inn on 19 March and 26 March, and we do encourage you to visit it.\n- The Council’s Strategy and Resources Committee (which is made up of a number of Sutton Councillors from both parties) will consider whether they can agree Heads of Agreement with Subsea 7. This is basically an agreement to go ahead, subject to planning permission. The meeting is open to the public.\n- If the Heads of Agreement are agreed, Subsea 7 can then apply for planning permission and all aspects of their application, including the impact on parking, will be assessed against current planning standards. Residents have the opportunity to submit their comments on the application and the decision will be taken by the Council’s Development Control Committee, again made up of Sutton’s elected Councillors.”",

At the Sutton Council meeting on 9 May 2011 the pavilion was included in the list of buildings to be added to the Sutton Local List.\nThis is the only building in Sutton South Ward to be included on the Local List, though the Registry Office in Worcester Road is on the national list of Listed Buildings.\nThe building is the only one of the buildings put forward as additions during the consultation process to make it to the final list. This was attributed to the fact that Councillor Clifton had put forward a carefully researched case, including adequate evidence.\nThe Sutton Local List is a list of buildings thought to be of importance to the comunity, though not of sufficient merit to be “Listed Buildings” for inclusion on the national list. The list thus includes local buildings of significance to the local community. Sutton Council has been consulting on additions to the Local List and, at a presentation to the Sutton South, Cheam and Belmont Local Committee on 27 January, it became evident that not one single building in Sutton South Ward was under consideration for inclusion on the local list. This led to Councillor Clifton proposing inclusion of the pavilion.\nThe inclusion of the pavilion on the list may be helpful in the preservation of the character of this area as an Area of Special Local Character (ASLC), and thus resisting any inappropriate development in the area, such as demolition of houses and erection of blocks of flats, which has been the trend in adjacent areas. At a Planning Appeal attended by Councillor Clifton last year he had to explain to the Inspector the importance of local people of the ASLC and why it should be taken into account in the planning decision.\nCouncillor Clifton said:\n“I am delighted with this outcome. One of our key objectives, as local Councillors, is to preserve the character of the Area of Special Local Character at the east end of Sutton South Ward. We must resist the trend to knock down houses and build small blocks of flats, which has led to a shortage of family homes in many parts of Sutton South Ward, and half the children living in accommodatin with no access to a garden. This recognition of the importance of buildings such as the Edwardian tennis club to the special character of the area may be helpful to us in pursuing that objective.”\nIn proposing the pavilion, Councillor Clifton wrote:\n“It is an Edwardian tennis pavilion, built in 1908 by the local architect Percy Vere Windebank, on the triangle of land at the junction of Mayfield Road and The Ridgway, in South Sutton Ward. It is a relatively unaltered example of a small, Edwardian tennis club pavilion, though the windows have been altered in an unsympathetic manner.\nThe history of the building is interesting. Up to 1906 this area was lavender fields. Between 1906 and 1914 Windebank laid out the Highfields Estate, building what is now The Ridgway, Mayfield Road , Chalgrove Road and Hillcroome Road . The concept was an estate of large, expensive houses with large gardens, grouped around or close to a triangle of land on which there would be a lawn tennis and croquet club, for the benefit of the residents. In 2008 the Highfields Residents’ Association published a history of the estate, “Highfields 100”, to mark the centenary. A copy of this history, to which Councillor Clifton is listed as a contributor, is obtainable from Mr Keith Percy at 63 The Ridgway, SM2 5JX. The houses are of some architectural merit, as indicated in the history.\nWe believe the pavilion was built by 1908, as the Highfield Lawns tennis club was in existence by that year. On 22 August 1908 an advertisement for the first of the newly-built houses on the estate was published in the Surrey County Herald newspapers, and mentioned the private tennis club on the estate. Highfield Lawns Ltd. was established as a company by 1913 with the sole objective of owning the land in order to allow the tennis and croquet club to operate. Those who bought one of Windebank’s houses could buy shares in Highfield Lawns. The Articles of Association of the company provide, to this day, that if you own a share in the company you can only vote on its affairs if you also own property in the Highfields Estate.\nOver the years the large gardens have been sold off for infill housing, mostly of a good quality. The area is designated an Area of Special Local Character (ASLC) and the Edwardian tennis pavilion is central to the character of the area. Were it to be proposed to demolish and re-build the pavilion any replacement would need to be a building of a similar character (not a modern building or a concrete slab) due to the ASLC designation. If the Local List is a list of buildings of some local significance, the pavilion should be on the list. This is based on criteria 3, a building of significant local interest.”\nCouncillors Clifton and Honour would welcome information on any famous people who have lived in Sutton South Ward, for consideration as to whether there should be a plaque erected on the property where they lived.\nThis is a picture of the clubhouse taken from the triangle in The Ridgway. A photograph taken in 1913 shows an almost identical scene.",

Trish was first elected in 2014 and was re-elected in 2018 and 2022. Louise was elected in 2022. Richard served as Mayor of Sutton for 2016-17 and Trish was our Mayor for a record three yearly terms, to May 2023. Louise is our Deputy Mayor for a second successive year, through to May 2025.\nLouise, Richard and Trish at City Hall presenting the petition opposing ULEZ signed by over 10 000 Sutton residents\nCONTINUE DOWN THE PAGE TO OUR CURRENT NEWS STORIES\nOR CLICK ON THE LINKS BELOW TO GO TO OUR SPECIFIC PAGES\nThe statue “The Messenger” by David Wynne, in The Quadrant, is close to the boundary between our Ward and Sutton Central Ward\nOn 10 April there was a remarkable victory for the Liberal Democrat candidate, Richard Choi, in a by-election to elect a Councillor for Sutton Central Ward on Sutton Council. Sutton Central Ward is immediately north of our Ward, Sutton South.\nRichard got more votes than all the other six candidates added together. The result was\nLiberal Democrats 1291\nConservatives 327\nReform 282\nLabour 216\nThree other candidates (the Greens, an independent and the Christian People’s Alliance) each got less than 100 votes.\nThe Liberal Democrat share of the vote increased by 17.4%, the Conservatives fell by 10% and Labour – who finished second in this seat in 2022 – by 17.4%.\nOn 3 March the Council discussed the budget proposals for the coming year. Legally, the Council is required to set a balanced budget. With so many Councils going bust or in great financial difficulty, this was always going to be a difficult task. The problems are due to a legacy of Government cuts but also a big spike in demand for services. While people think of the Council as the body that mends the potholes, empties the bins and fixes the street lights, 70% of spending is on adult social care and children’s services (particularly for those children with special educational needs), plus the cost of finding accommodation for the homeless. There has been an increase in demand in the past year, particularly in the number of adults whose social care has to be paid for by the Council, the number of children with special educational needs and in the number of homeless families.\nRichard spoke in the debate, on homelessness – a subject in which he has a special interest due to the work history of his daughter, Ellie, who worked for many years for a homelessness charity and because as chair of Planning Committee he has a role in increasing the supply of affordable family accommodation.\nHere is Richard’s speech:\n“I would like to direct the attention of Council to paragraph 8.11 of the supplemental agenda which is discussing financial risks.\nIt says that the biggest driver of overspending by London boroughs is the number of people presenting as homeless and who need to be offered temporary accommodation.\nThe paper tells us Sutton had 1 084 households homeless and in temporary accommodation in October last year. It is a higher figure tonight. It is a frightening figure. Tonight we are discussing homelessness as a financial risk to the Council, but we all recognise that the fundamental reason for our concern is that behind so many of these cases are stories of tragedy, of families losing their homes and often winding up in bed and breakfast accommodation remote from their workplace and remote from the schools their children attend.\nThere is a housing crisis and we need more homes. Residents comment on the number of new flats being built in the centre of Sutton but we need this accommodation.\nThe aspiration of the Government to build more homes is right – but it has to be tempered by a concern about quality and about dealing with the consequences.\nSutton is very built up. It is not always easy to see where the new homes will come from, particularly when we are all rightly sensitive to the concerns of residents about inappropriate development and the pressures intensification can bring.\nIt is worthwhile re-stating the principles in our local plan for Sutton.\nWe need more housing, but it must be of good quality – good enough for Sutton, which means of high quality.\nWe aim to reduce development pressures on what I call the “suburban heartland” of the borough by concentrating development in the areas where development is appropriate.\nIn particular there is a zone of potential intensification close to the town centre where public transport connections are good. This may mean some tall buildings. It may mean car free or car light development as you can provide much more accommodation if you do not have to provide a parking space for every unit, and this is more acceptable in areas close to the railway station and the town centre where public transport connections are good.\nWe have a local plan, currently under review, which sets out how we meet the requirements for infrastructure to support an increase in population, which is an important concern of residents.\nI am always keen to point out that our local plan is not like the local plan you might find in, for example, North Korea, mandating what will be built. It is aspirational. It depends on developers bringing forward proposals. Its success depends a lot on the skills of our planning staff in negotiating with developers to secure what is good for Sutton, which may not be what makes most profit for the developer. I would like to pay tribute to the work of our planning staff and in particular the head, Andy Webber, who retires this month.\nIn the past year the planning system has had a bad press. The Government says we are going for growth, growth, growth. Quite right. But when asked what are the impediments to growth they invariably cite the planning system – which is represented as run by NIMBYS frustrating necessary development. That might well be the case in some places – not here in Sutton of course. But I think there is a counter argument that the planning system is a bastion against having fields and fields of sub-standard housing, as that is what makes money for developers. We destroy the planning system at our peril. But it is also right that we need a planning system that does not stand in the way of necessary change and renewal, but ensures high quality and appropriate development, to provide housing and to stimulate the economy.\nI think we have a good track record in Sutton in supporting high quality development and there are many examples in our borough of developments characterised by good design providing quality housing and infrastructure. That is what we need.”\nThe bench at the junction of The Ridgway and Mayfield Road\nThere are a number of locations in our Ward where there are benches to enable weary pedestrians to put up their feet. At the most recent meeting of the Council’s local committee we got agreement to re-new two benches in the Ward that have deteriorated over time. These are benches in Copse Hill and the one in the photograph, which is at the junction of The Ridgway and Mayfield Road.\nThere is a history to some of the benches in our Ward. In 1988 the South Sutton Neighbourhood Association celebrated the tenth anniversary of its foundation by funding a bench in Cavendish Road close to Ambleside Gardens. The bench was, after over twenty years of use and exposure to the elements, in a very sorry state. We took action to get the bench restored, with the plaque explaining the history of the bench moved to the new bench.\nOn the 27th of January Sutton Council met. Richard raised the issue of the reasons why a recent survey by The Times newspaper ranked Sutton as the eighth most attractive place to live in England. This finding does not surprise us. We spend a lot of time knocking on the doors of our residents to introduce ourselves as your local Councillors and we find people generally say they really like Sutton, mentioning a strong sense of community, open spaces, low crime, good schools, a green and pleasant environment, parks, street trees, being convenient for London and for the countryside. This is particularly the case with people who have moved to Sutton from elsewhere, particularly those from other London boroughs, from Hong Kong and from Ukraine. Please write to us and tell us what you like about Sutton or think we can improve.\nWe are always keen to look at ways of improving our Ward.\nLast year traffic engineers undertook a study of traffic flows in our Ward and the results of the exercise are listed in a later post on this site. The results have not led to some “standout” conclusion as to a problem that needs tackling but traffic officers are examining three main issues:\nwhether action can be taken to improve the safety and the experience of pedestrians crossing the Kings Lane bridge without closing the road to vehicles. The bridge is narrow. Installing a second bridge would be impossibly expensive. Marking a pedestrian path at one side of the road might be feasible. We would welcome the views of users of the bridge, both pedestrians and motorists\nsimilarly, whether something can be done to improve the safety and the experience of pedestrians passing under the railway bridge in Langley Park Road. Some proposals are to be consulted on\npossible improvements to the busy junction where Cedar Road crosses Langley Park Road. Residents have spoken to us of the difficulties pedestrians have in crossing Langley Park Road. Consultation with residents in adjacent streets is underway on proposals to install two new traffic islands in Langley Park Road. These will form a safe area in the middle of the road so the road can be crossed by pedestrians in two phases.\nYour views on these issues, and views on any other traffic and parking issues you would like us to look at would be welcomed.\nThe police met residents of Sutton South Ward again on the evening of 15 January 2025, at Devonshire Avenue school. There are open, public meetings held quarterly at which the police discuss the policing of the Ward with local residents. We were addressed by our Ward Constable, Constable Robyn Skivens, who went through the crime statistics for the Ward. Sutton has a lower crime rate than most outer London boroughs and our Ward has one of the lowest crime rates in Sutton. However, crime always has a significant impact on the victim and public concern remains high. The draft minutes of the meeting are as below.\nSUTTON SOUTH COMMUNITY / POLICE MEETING. 15 JANUARY 2025 Attended by PC Robyn Skivens and PCSO Helen Maguire for the police. A report was given on main crime trends from 1 September to the date of the meeting. DRUG OFFENCES There had been 18 drug offences, mainly possession of drugs, mainly cannabis. While this was higher than normal the increase was partly attributable to a special police operation at Sutton train station. Four of these crimes were the interception by the Border Force of drug shipments. Where such a shipment is to premises in our Ward it will count in our statistics. BURGLARY There had been 21 burglaries or attempted burglaries. This included residential burglaries, burglaries of garages and sheds, and some burglaries of businesses. It was noted that there was usually a seasonal increase in burglary at this time of year as it was darker earlier. There had been eight residential burglaries. However, some that had been reported in sheltered accommodation in the Ward were later disproved and attributed to dementia. A disturbing case was that of a landlord who was able to let himself into a flat and commit theft. Two burglaries of garages had involved theft of bicycles. Mention was made of a shop in Brighton Road where the window was smashed and the wooden panel that was then put in place to secure the premises was pulled away to facilitate burglary. Mention was made of the theft of tools from a construction site in the Ward. Some burglaries had involved the theft of keys, which were then used to commit further offences (theft of a car key leading to theft of a car). The police stressed the need to make sure keys were kept out of sight – if the keys can be seen from your letterbox you are inviting crime.\nVEHICLE CRIME\nThere had been 14 instances of vehicle crime (theft of vehicles, damage to vehicles, theft from vehicles). The police stressed the need to avoid leaving anything of value on display in your car, or in the car at all. An unusual crime had been the theft of an excavator and a dumper from the road works in Brighton Road. THEFT There had been 23 crimes in a category the police described as “theft and kindred (to theft)” events. This included shoplifting, parcel theft, theft of pedal cycles and mobile phones. Examples mentioned included theft of scrap metal, theft of a wheelie bin and theft of a wedding ring by distraction techniques. MAJOR CRIMES There had been nine major, violent crimes in the Ward. This included several robberies at the train station, a large group altercation outside a restaurant, a fight between two drug users, and a concerning incident of a woman who was followed from the station and robbed. There were also two incidents of arson, of a bin and of a Ford transit. A ULEZ camera was deliberately damaged. There was an incident where a drug user was searched and a knife, and bladed articles, were found to be in his possession. There was a disturbing incident of an anti-semitic symbol being daubed on a wall outside the synagogue in Cedar Road. There had been a succession of incidents related to a woman living in Cedar Road who had engaged in anti- social activities that had attracted a community of drug users to her premises. This was now the subject of police reports to the DPS that were expected to lead to her being charged with serious offences. SPEEDING The police had been conducting a programme of visits to local care homes and sheltered housing to talk about scams. Residents had raised with them concerns about speeding in Cavendish Road, which had led to police action in that road. There was a discussion of speeding in local roads including Chalgrove Road, Langley Park Road, The Ridgway and Cavendish Road. The police had been carrying out speed checks in Chalgrove Road and Cavendish Road. The action in Cavendish Road had led to twelve drivers receiving warnings. The police would consider further action against speeding in local roads, subject to resources.\nOTHER MATTERS DISCUSSED Staffing levels: There should be in theory be a third officer on the Ward to support Robyn and Helen, but they were coping. The number of “extractions” when they were called away to join police exercises elsewhere in London, or at the Croydon custody suite, remained an issue of concern but was now running close to 35% of their time rather than the 50% it had once been. Mention was made of local concern about a story that a body had been discovered at a house in Egmont Road. The police assured the meeting that there was no wider implication of this incident. The next meeting was tentatively scheduled for Wednesday 14 May at Devonshire Avenue school (7pm) subject to the police checking their work rota. The meeting thanked Robyn for coming back from leave to attend the meeting and thanked the officers for their work for the community in dealing with crime in the Ward. The meeting thanked Fiona Ostler for letting us meet at the school. The date of the next meeting was provisionally set as Wednesday 14 May, at Devonshire Avenue primary school and thought continues to be given to what could be done to better publicise the meeting and get a better attendance.\nConstable Skivens, Louise, Trish and Richard with other Ward police officers at the Sutton South Hello Christmas party\nThe Phoenix Concert Band – which is based in our Ward and for which Richard plays trumpet – were busy over the Christmas period raising money for the Mayor of Sutton’s charity appeal. The band practices every Friday in the church at Christchurch in Christchurch Park. A concert in the church, staged by the band in December, drew an audience of over a hundred and raised £790 for the charity appeal. The band also played Christmas carols at an event in the Straw cafe in Manor Park in December, which raised £360. On the last Saturday before Christmas the band joined a wider group of musicians to play Christmas carols in the atrium of the St Nicholas shopping centre in Sutton (see photo) which raised £180, so £1330 in all. We were grateful to the Mayor, Councillor Colin Stears, who attended all these events. In addition the band played a concert at the Friends’ Meeting House in Cedar Road on the second Saturday in December, to entertain an enthusiastic audience before the “Second Saturday Tea” which the Quakers provide every month on the second Saturday. The Mayor of Sutton’s charities are Home-Start, Sutton, and Sutton, Kingston and Epsom – Parkinson’s UK. Our contribution to the appeal was dwarfed by the £10 000 prize for second place in the boroughs’ competition won by the Sutton float in the London New Year’s Day parade.\nWe pride ourselves on the fact that we have a network of dedicated volunteers who deliver our “FOCUS” magazine throughout the Ward. If you have the odd half hour a few times a year to support us in this way please contact us. We recently prepared an end of year newsletter to update our volunteer deliverers on our activities. We thought we would share it with those who look at our website.\n“The last year has been our most successful year in Sutton South Ward. With the election of Luke as our Member of Parliament in July we have, for the first time, three Liberal Democrat Councillors representing our Ward and a Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament representing us at Westminster. We held a successful Ward meeting on 28 November where we heard from Luke on the incredibly busy life he now has as our Member of Parliament. He has been meeting all the important community groups in Sutton and Cheam, and has made speeches in Parliament on a variety of issues – ranging from the importance of support for carers to the future of Taiwan. In his maiden speech he spoke about what a pleasant place Sutton is to live, work and raise a family, a great change from the previous MP who spent all his time running Sutton down. He is enthusiastic about his role as spokesperson for London. As Ward Councillors, we have a lot of local casework that we deal with and are doing more than our fair bit as Chairs of Council committees – Trish chairing the Audit and Governance Committee, Richard the Planning Committee and Louise combining being chair of the Licensing Committee with her role as Deputy Mayor. This is her second year as Deputy Mayor following the three years during which Trish was Mayor.\nLike every local authority, Sutton Council is pre-occupied by financial issues and struggling with some difficult decisions to balance the books. The decision to close the Registrar’s office (The Russetings) in Worcester Road was one we regretted, driven by a need to consolidate services in fewer buildings, but we believe planning controls are sufficient to protect the appearance of this attractive, locally listed, building in the street scene.\nWe have secured funding for improvements to the WArd, including new information signs at the only open space in our Ward – the Devonshire Avenue Nature Area (DANA). Maintenance of the nature area involves a balance of ensuring it is a peaceful place for people to visit while preserving the biodiversity of the site. There is now a Friends of DANA group – let us know if you would like to join it. We are already looking forward to our next electoral challenge, to retain control of the Council in 2026. We need to keep up the work of talking to our residents, delivering our literature and doorknocking. Let us know if you are interested in being one of our candidates. We welcome talking or corresponding with you and with all our residents. We hope to have further Ward meetings next year. We are really grateful for the help we get.”\nSutton South Councillors were concerned to learn about changes proposed to the organisation of the Police Cadets, who meet at a school in our ward. Currently there are over 120 cadets. However, the decision has been made to close junior cadets and cut the remaining senior cadets to just 46. Their future programme is also being severely curtailed. This will have a major impact on the youth of this borough who will no longer have the opportunity to participate in activities such as camps, parades and Duke of Edinburgh awards.\nCouncillor Louise Phelan, whose son has been a Cadet, commented “I’ve seen first-hand the benefits of being part of police cadets. They learn valuable life skills, and gain self confidence. They also support the local community and get to take part in things they wouldn’t otherwise have had the opportunity to do. For many this is a stepping stone into a career within the police force, for others the Cadets help to keep them on the right path and make better life decisions. I am incredibly concerned others will now not get these opportunities.”",

There has been a high response and the timetable for future action has been spelt out.\nAll residents received a consultation letter from Sutton Council relating to the parking issues in our Ward. When the Council’s Environment and Neighbourhoods Committee adopted the parking strategy in late 2016, involving a programme of consultation with residents over a period of time, we were pleased at the programme of consultation proposed but unhappy with the timescales. To undertake consultation in a way the traffic engineers could cope with, action in our area would not start till well into 2018. Following our campaign, this first stage has now been brought forward.\nThe consultation document recognises that there is a high demand for commuter parking near to Sutton train station and the town centre, in our Ward. The fact that part of our area is just outside the Sutton Controlled Parking Zone (CPZ) means that there is more pressure on local roads, leading to parking problems being moved onto neighbouring streets.\nThe consultation will gather feedback from local residents in respect of parking pressures, issues and the days/times these are occurring to feed into wider analysis and development of options to progress to statutory consultation to address these issues.\nThe consultation ran until early January and response was via postage paid return envelope. Responses will be collated and analysed, the results to be fed back to consult on next steps. The timetable has now been spelt out and will involve analysis of responses and road-by-road results in the Spring, consultation on proposed options over the summer.

The two most challenging pieces of work I did were the re-design of the Council tax support scheme and the re-design of the Council’s committee system.\nThe Government “localised” Council tax support (the system of support payments to the most needy) by axing the national scheme. It invited local authorities to set up their own scheme but passed down to Councils only some of the funding. This cost Sutton £1.1 million. The challenge was to devise a local scheme which, while inevitably less generous, protected the vulnerable. The scheme I devised, which was ultimately accepted, provided support to those in most need and protected from cuts in benefit the elderly, the disabled, lone parents and families with small children. There were difficult choices and it was one of the most difficult projects I have undertaken in 40 years work in public administration.\nThe revision of the Council’s committee system I worked on was designed to take advantage of provisions in the Localism Act that made it possible to move from an “Executive” system to a “subject committee” system I considered more democratic. I led the group considering options and developed a scheme that was the basis for the system Sutton now has adopted.\nI also did a lot of work on a scrutiny of the Council’s policies on homelessness. This issue concerned me as I felt that some of the policies being recommended to us by Conservative Councillors would have increased homelessness, and the scrutiny activity demonstrated this.\nI have also been a member of the Audit Committee, the Scrutiny Committee, the Standards Committee, the Development Control Committee and the representative of Sutton on numerous external bodies and boards, such as the Downland Project (which organises volunteers to, for example, clear scrubland in local woods).\nWhen I was elected I obtained an exercise book (I do not trust computerised systems) and wrote on the cover “Casework.” Item number one was an issue raised by a resident of Copse Hill about a tree in the road demolished by a car. I got it replaced. My most recent entry in the Casework book (a disputed parking ticket I got rescinded) is item number 413, but this does not quite do me justice as some of these entries are multiple issues and some issues I was able to resolve almost immediately without resort to the “Casework” book.\nThere are some issues affecting the Ward as a whole that I have worked on that give me particular satisfaction – including the extension of the “no drinking zone” (controlling the drinking of alcohol in a public place) from the town centre to cover most of the Ward, the improvements to the Devonshire Avenue Nature Area while retaining its central purpose as a nature reserve, the safety improvements to the Grange Vale bridge, opening the side entrance to Sutton station (work now underway), getting more trees planted, helping found the Sutton South Hello! Project to tackle social isolation, getting funding for measures to combat speeding in Cavendish Road and Cedar Road, and securing 780 local jobs through the Subsea7 project (jobs are gold dust). The regular surgeries we have held have convinced me that there is a real issue for people in their 50s made redundant from work in getting back into the labour market, and the really big difference you can make to an area is ensuring there are local jobs. There are very few Councillors in Britain who can claim they have been instrumental in getting so many jobs for their area, given the massive competition between local authorities for such job-creating inward investment.\nThere were also many things I did for individual residents. Some of these projects gave me great satisfaction – such as getting a disabled parking bay moved so that it was not under a tree and thus the disabled resident did not get her car covered, every day, with droppings. For another resident, I got her over £2 000 in a compensation payment through pursuing her case. Some of the issues I dealt with, particularly those involving anti-social behaviour, were difficult and sometimes harrowing.\nThe background I brought to my period as a Councillor was that I am a retired civil servant who was, at one time, Chair of the Board of a European Agency (the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, based in Bilbao, Spain) and at another time Chair of the Channel Tunnel Safety Authority. After a long career in public service at a European and national level it was a priviledge and a pleasure to use the skills I had obtained, in the service of my immediate, local community. My wife Gloria and I have lived in our Ward for 26 years and both our daughters went to local State schools. I like Sutton, which has a pleasant suburban atmosphere, low crime, good schools, affordable housing and low unemployment. I have been motivated by a desire to play my part in keeping its many benefits. And the values I bring to being a Councillor are those of a concern to use the skills I have acquired in life to benefit the disadvantaged in society – in society as a whole and, in my work these past four years, in the immediate community around me. And I have still managed to find time to play the trumpet in a Sutton-based concert band, playing last year in a concert at Christchurch for the 125th. anniversary of the church, and playing Christmas carols at the Friends’ Meeting House for the past two years.\nThere has been hardly a day in the last four years when I have not been engaged on some activity on behalf of the residents of Sutton.\nRICHARD CLIFTON",

Any Sutton resident who encounters a rough sleeper can contact Streetlink, who will provide an outreach worker and refer the rough sleeper to the appropriate council in order to arrange accommodation and support.\nThe call to residents comes as Sutton Council launches a new service to help single homeless people from Sutton access the private rented sector. Vulnerable people from the borough that are identified as rough sleeping will be offered dedicated support to find suitable accommodation, negotiate with landlords, complete tenancy agreements. THEYcan receive help towards paying initial rental deposits.\nThe new measure is in addition to Sutton Council’s existing Sutton Rough Sleeping Group which was set up last year to help rough sleepers enter accommodation and rebuild their lives. The group brings together agencies that work with rough sleepers, including drug and alcohol services, Sutton JobCentre and voluntary organisations.\nAt this time of year, rough sleepers are at much greater risk from illness or even death due to exposure to freezing weather conditions.\nWe set up the Sutton Rough Sleeping Group to help those individuals move into suitable accommodation and now we have increased support. The service is providing much needed support to help them overcome difficulties such as ineligibility for social housing and expensive private rental costs.\nAlthough we do not have large numbers of rough sleepers in Sutton, many of them often seek out open spaces like parks. Due to this, the council is seeking help from members of the public to notify them of anyone that is rough sleeping.\nAnyone who sees a rough sleeper should first call Streetlink on 0300 500 0914.\nRichard has a particular interest in rough sleeping and homelessness, partly because his daughter Ellie is the communications manager for st. Basil’s, the largest homelessness charity in the West Midlands. He led the scrutiny carried out by the Housing, Economy and Business Committee of the Council’s policies on avoiding homelessness, which showed that a change to the policy (leading to people becoming homeless and being put in B and B accommodation before all legal steps were concluded) promoted by Conservative Councillors would have increased homelessness in Sutton.",

Here is the text of the speech he was to have made:\n“I am confident that we will all want to support this motion and to emphasise the importance to Sutton of maintaining a through rail service to north London. I’d like to mention a significant detail that ought to be recognised in our examination of this proposal here tonight.\nThis concerns the importance of links to St Pancras International as St Pancras develops further as an international rail hub.\nOver the next few years there will be a mushrooming of international rail travel from London. If the current plans of Deutschbahn and Eurostar come to fruition – as they will – by 2014 it will be possible, on arriving at St Pancras, to have a choice of services, competing against each other, to travel from London to Amsterdam.\nIn addition to the current services to Brussels and Paris there will also be services from London to North Germany. This is a big market in terms of business travel. At present, each day, about 30 plane services fly between London’s airports and destinations in north Germany, carrying about the same number of people as could be carried by four or five train services using the Velaro D trains that are even now being built to provide rolling stock for these services, by the train manufacturer Siemens at its Dusseldorf factory, which in fact I visited last year.\nAside from the potential importance of these international links to the residents of Sutton, there are international companies that have significant centres of their enterprises in Sutton – Sutton, a thriving London suburb, offering office space much cheaper than that found in the centre of London, less than half an hour by train from the centre, with a pleasant ambience and environment, and a location from which – importantly – you can reach the centre of Brussels in just two train journeys, one taking about 40 minutes and one about 2 hours.\nAnd the centre of Paris in just 15 minutes more. And soon – Amsterdam, north Germany.\nThese transport links are links that it is vital for Sutton to maintain, for the sake of our residents but also to maintain our attractiveness as a centre for business development.\nWe must keep pressure on the Department for Transport to make clear that the changes to the Capital Connect franchise being sought by the domestic train companies, that remove our links to north London and in particular to St Pancras, are just not acceptable.”",
  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_2020_04_08_successful-outcome-to-parking-consultation/content_179.html": "We now have the results of the final stage of the Council’s consultation on parking. The third round of consultation was on a proposal developed from the results of the first two consultations, for a Permit Parking Area in roads in our Ward east of Langley Park Road.\nWHAT HAPPENED IN THE EARLIER ROUNDS OF CONSULTATION\nAs parking is often raised as a problem in the regular surveys of residents on what they like about living in Sutton, the Council asked residents if parking was a problem in their road and what they would like done. Earlier rounds of consultation led to proposals that were not given sufficient support by residents for the Council to proceed with them.\nThere were concerns that unless the controls cover the whole local area parking will be displaced into roads without controls, and “free to park at any time” bays would be a magnet for commuters and long stay parkers, squeezing out residents. The alternative to schemes that have these disadvantages is a residents-only Permit Parking Area (PPA).\nTHE FINAL STAGE OF CONSULTATION\nConsequently, the Council consulted residents at the end of 2019 on a proposed PPA. As roads not within the scheme will suffer from displaced parking if the roads nearby are in the scheme, the area consulted on was wide, running from Egmont Road to Willis Avenue and Prior Avenue – including Chalgrove Road, The Ridgway, Mayfield Road, Farm Road, Farm Close, Upland Road, Kayemoor Road, Downside Road, Willis Avenue and Prior Avenue.\nThe results of the consultation are clear – in every one of the roads listed above a majority of those expressing a view on the proposals supported their introduction. In some roads – particularly Chalgrove, Mayfield, The Ridgway, Upland – this was by a large margin. In all these roads more than one in four residents responded to the study, a high response rate for such local consultation exercises, and opinion was more than two to one in support of the proposed parking controls. In other roads consulted there was a lower response rate but still majorities in favour of the proposals. Once a scheme is introduced, any individual road left out will suffer high levels of parking, so any scheme needs to cover the whole area. It is a clear result that gives the Council a mandate to proceed with the introduction of the PPA consulted on.\nThe way the PPA works is that only residents can park their vehicles in the road for a “control period”, 9 to 11 AM each day on weekdays, thus removing commuters and long stay parkers. Residents who need to park a car on the road rather than in their drive during the “control period” will need to obtain a parking permit to display on the vehicle, and many residents will want to obtain “visitors’ permits” for their visitors if the visitors need to park in the street during the control period. There are special arrangements for carers. As this scheme will involve some costs of administration and enforcement there will be a charge for a permit, to cover costs, though all residents can get an initial supply of visitors’ permits without charge. The Council can cover costs but not use parking charges to subsidise other services. Parking charges in Sutton are amongst the lowest of any London borough. Charges per vehicle are on a scale you can find on the Council website and start at £40. A similar charge in Croydon is £80, Merton and Kingston £90, Richmond £99. You only need a permit if you need to park a car in the road during the “control period.” A PPA involves notices to advise motorists of the parking controls but there is no need for yellow lines.\nResidents will receive a letter from the Council which will set out the timetable for introducing the scheme, later this year, and how to obtain permits.\nMany residents are concerned about parking and we are pleased they have now had the opportunity to put their view on a concrete proposal developed on the basis of consultation, and a clear outcome has emerged.\nSPEEDING AND POLLUTION\nWe are concerned that the removal of parking from the area will lead to clear roads that will attract more traffic and speeding. In many parts of London, though often more affluent areas, residents have campaigned to get the traffic out of otherwise quiet residential streets and onto the main roads by turning roads into cul-de-sacs, thus creating quiet roads with better air quality and no through traffic. A good example locally is the gate at the end of Dorset Road which makes Homeland Drive a quiet, traffic free road. We are interested in the proposals residents have been putting to us for consultation on such traffic initiatives in our area. Nothing is currently proposed but, as traffic continues to increase, this is the next issue we need to look at. Do let us know your views.",

This is particularly the case with people who have moved to Sutton from elsewhere, particularly those from other London boroughs, from Hong Kong and from Ukraine. Please write to us and tell us what you like about Sutton or think we can improve.\nNOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR SUTTON: PLANNING APPLICATION IN MULGRAVE ROAD TURNED DOWN\nThe owner of Chelsea Court, 54 Mulgrave Road has had planning permission to extend the building – in effect adding two extra floors to the block of flats – refused by Sutton Council. This was the latest in a series of applications in our Ward where owners of blocks of flats have sought to extend the building upwards.\nAs local Councillors, we were concerned about these proposals. While there is a need for more accommodation, the changes to the building would in our view make it look incongruous, not good enough for Sutton. The block is an attractive architect-designed building (see photo), one of the more attractive blocks in Mulgrave Road, and the proposed changes would destroy the symmetry of the building. The Planning Department at Sutton Council agreed with our objections. The changes would also have involved building work that would greatly disturb the current residents of the block.\nThe owners used a mechanism called “prior approval” when submitting their planning application. This mechanism, in our view, was introduced by the Government to undermine the planning system. As a result, we could take the application to the Council’s Planning Committee, which Richard chairs, for decision by Councillors. We may still not be able to stop these changes taking place given the powers of the remote Planning Inspectorate based in Bristol to over-ride local decisions.\nWe always seek to ensure in such cases that a number of conditions are stipulated in any planning permission, if one is ever granted, to try to protect the peace and quiet of the building during construction work. These include that access to the roof should be via an external hoist with all materials for work on the roof transported to the roof by an external hoist and not brought up via the well of the building. The interior of the building should not be a storage area or building site. There should be a construction management plan to minimize disruption to existing residents and ensure there are controls on dust and noise, and on hours of work. The contractors should join the Considerate Contractors’ Scheme. There should be a liaison officer that residents can contact if they observe poor behaviour. If scaffolding is erected outside residents’ windows it should only be erected when needed and removed as soon as it is not needed.\nWe have successfully opposed this development but wait to see if the developer will appeal to the Planning Inspectorate against the decision of the Council.\nFURTHER PROPOSALS FOR NORTHUMBERLAND HOUSE\nWe are again involved in arguments over proposals to add extra storeys the top of Northumberland House.\nNorthumberland House is the tower block at the corner of Brighton Road and Wellesley Road, about 200 yards along Brighton Road if you turn left when coming out of Sutton station.\nCriterion Capital, the owners of Northumberland House, are again seeking planning permission to add two storeys to the top of the building. The owners are again seeking to extend the building, creating a further 29 flats by adding two extra storeys on the top of the ten storey part of the building and an extra storey on the lower part, with some additional flats in the “undercroft” above the parking area. Some of the current parking spaces would be lost.\nAn earlier similar application was not supported by Sutton Council on the basis of design of the proposed tower extension and issues about the alignment of the windows. Planning law allows developers to seek to over-ride the decisions of local Councillors by appealing to the remote Bristol-based Planning Inspectorate, whose decision is final. The developers went to appeal, to the Planning Inspectorate, and on 5 October Richard and Louise attended and spoke on behalf of residents at a hearing organised by the Planning Inspectorate.\nWe had noted that there would be some positives, such as the creation of a community amenity and play space on the tarmaced area at ground floor level. However, while there is a shortage of accommodation in London and more housing is needed, we were concerned that the building work had the potential to be extremely disruptive to the lives of current residents. And an extra two storeys on the top of the building looks incongruous and out of keeping with the design of the rest of the building. Richard told the Inspector the design “looked like a couple of portacabins had been dumped on the top of the building.” At the hearing we told the Planning Inspector that residents of Northumberland House are concerned about the likely disruption involved in this proposed work, and have long standing concerns about frequent lift breakdowns in the building and the general standard of housekeeping, particularly in the bin area. We pressed the Inspector to impose conditions, if he were to agree to the scheme, to protect the interests of residents, and include these conditions in any planning permission they eventually obtained. We asked that access to the roof areas would be only by external hoists, and that the peace and quiet of the interior of the building would not be disturbed or the interior turned into a storage area, or building site. We sought controls on scaffolding to ensure any scaffolding that is required is removed as soon as the requirement has passed. We insisted there must be a construction management plan to control hours of work and control noise and dust nuisance. We asked that the contractor joins the “Considerate Contractors Scheme”, which provides a route for residents to raise concerns if they observe poor behaviour. We were pleased that the developers indicated they would accept all these conditions.\nThe Inspector supported our views and commented that the proposed building looks “incongruous” – the exact wording Richard had used at the hearing. He turned down the application and also refused the application for costs.\nThe owners have now submitted a further, similar application. Residents can see the proposals via the Council’s website (go to the section on planning and follow leads to get to comment on planning applications). It is application DM2023/00796. We are keen to learn of the views of residents on this matter, particularly those who live in Northumberland House. Do contact us at the email addresses given in the first post on this site.\nNEW ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING POINTS PLANNED FOR MULGRAVE ROAD\nIn support of our policies to combat global warming and reduce carbon emissions, the programme to fit electric vehicle charging points in lampposts in our Ward continues. A further consultation exercise is about to take place on the installation of two new electric vehicle charging points in Mulgrave Road, close to the junction with Worcester Road. A preliminary consultation found majority support but few residents responded.\nThere are now charging points at the following locations:\nOpposite 49 The Ridgway\nOpposite 26 Langley Park Road\nOpposite Foxley Court in Christchurch Park\nOpposite 10 Cumnor Road\nIn Cedar Gardens\nOpposite Grange Court, Grange Road\nOpposite Thomas House, Grange Road\nOpposite 13 Stanley Road\nOpposite Fairford Court, Stanley Road\nWe want to draw attention to the Sutton Citizen space survey where residents should log their suggestions for EV charge points.\nhttps://sutton.citizenspace.com/highways-environment-and-planning/ev-survey/\nThe photo shows the first vehicle that used the first charging point in the Ward, in The Ridgway. Given the policy to ultimately phase out petrol driven vehicles, a big and continuing expansion will be needed.\nSutton Council is working with Siemens to install Ubitricity lamp column electric vehicle charging points. Ubitricity lamp column charging points are compact and fit into the door of a lamp column.\nThe aim of lamp column charging is to give residents the ability to easily charge electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles on the street where they live, especially if they do not have off-street parking or are unable to install their own home charging point. Installing residential charging points is important because a key barrier to people switching to electric vehicles is the concern around where they will be able to charge their vehicle.\nNot all lamp columns are suitable for lamp column charging points. The lamp columns need to be “electrically suitable”, be positioned near the kerb and have enough internal space to fit the charging point. They need to be sensibly located so that a vehicle could safely park and charge next to the lamp column. The lamp columns also need to be made of metal, not concrete.\nAn “earth mat”, a small metal grid, is also installed in the footway next to the lamp column. This is to make the charging point “electrically safe” if there is a fault. There are signs to indicate that the lamp column has a charging point fitted, though this sign will not prevent non-electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles from parking next to the lamp column.\nThis is a major advance in our drive to promote electric vehicles and combat global warming.\nOUR CLIMATE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\nSutton Council has declared that there is a climate emergency and at the Council meeting on 16 January we adopted a progress report entitled “Environment Strategy and Climate Emergency: Progress Report and Update.” In his speech on this important report Richard pointed out that far from being some vague affirmation of worthy sentiments the report was packed full of detailed, positive actions we had taken and could be proud of. He listed some of them\n– ten new school streets\n– 120 dockless ebikes (although we came quite late to the concept of ebike schemes compared to many London boroughs)\n– double the number of new trees planted than our target\n– seven parks received the green flag award for their biodiversity management with butterfly banks in the parks\n– almost 7 000 teaching sessions on biodiversity, mostly to school age children\n– the work of the Sutton Nature Conservation Volunteers, the Community Environment Champions Network, the Green Enterprise partnership\n– the Healthy Homes Advice and Support Service, providing assessment of homes for energy efficiency\n– promoting green spaces, energy efficiency and electric vehicles through our planning policies and decisions\n– LED street lighting and electric vehicle charging points in street lamps\n– promoting re-cycling of waste\n– the promotion of initiatives to support locations where items can be repaired and re-used\n– action to deal with extreme weather events\n– promoting the cycling network and cycle maintenance and safety workshops\n– travel plans for our own staff to promote cycling and walking, and switching our own vehicles to electric.\nThe list goes on and on.\nThis is an important programme based on positive, practical steps we are taking to protect the environment.\nSUCCESS IN OPPOSING BLOTS ON THE LANDSCAPE\nPlanning issues have always been a major concern in Sutton South Ward, with numerous examples of poor quality developments we have seen off but others where local democracy has been overturned by the decisions of the remote Planning Inspectorate based in Bristol.\nAs Liberal Democrats, we think that an effective planning system based on local consultation is essential to maintaining the quality of development in our Ward. The system has been undermined by the Government, by extension of “permitted development” rights and by new provisions that make it possible to add two storeys to the top of a block of flats by going through truncated planning approval arrangements.\nThere has been a growing trend for developers to try to add extra storeys to the tops of blocks of flats. We have recently seen off three such proposals in our Ward, where the proposal would have made the building look incongruous and the building work would have been a nightmare for the current residents. The first of these was a block in Mulgrave Road, which failed to meet our standards of design – not good enough for Sutton. The second was in Grange Road – Magnolia Court. The third in Brighton Road – Northumberland House.\nWe need more housing, but not by agreeing to buildings that will be blots on the landscape for the next fifty years.\nTOWER BLOCK PROPOSALS AT BRIGHTON ROAD AGAIN THROWN OUT\nThere are two proposals for tower blocks in Brighton Road, almost opposite each other, submitted by developers, that Trish and Richard are fighting. One is on the eastern side of the road close to Cavendish Road. This proposal for a five storey block with 36 flats but only four parking spaces has been rejected by Sutton Council planning officers on a number of grounds including design. Richard said of both proposals:\n“While we need more accommodation these blocks, with little adjacent green space, are of poor design and would be blots on the landscape.”\nThe other proposal is almost opposite at the junction with Copse Hill. Developers have twice submitted proposals for this new tower block at the corner of Copse Hill, to be built after demolishing 2 and 4 Copse Hill, plus 52 and 54 Brighton Road. While housing is needed, we have also opposed this development as – unlike Dunsfold Court and Leith Towers nearby – it would have little green space around the site, and the parking provision proposed was inadequate, adding to parking pressures in the area. The block would be ugly, overbearing and a blot on the landscape.\nThese proposals were rejected by Sutton Council and the developers appealed to the remote Planning Inspectorate in Bristol, thus seeking to overturn democratic local decision taking. We are delighted that the Inspectorate has twice thrown out the proposals. They cite concerns over the overbearing character and appearance of the proposed block, a lack of outdoor amenity space (play areas and garden) and the mix of housing proposed (the number of small one bedroom flats). The Inspectorate rejected concerns about flooding and did not comment on our concerns over parking.\nThis may not be the end of the story so we will watch out for further proposals. Radical changes to planning arrangements were proposed in the recent White Paper on planning from the Conservative Government, proposals that in some areas would abolish these arrangements for comment on planning applications and lead to proposals being automatically agreed. Pressure from the Liberal Democrats, and our victory in the Chesham and Amersham by-election, where planning changes was an issue, seems to be forcing a re-think, but these proposals are still, as of now, Government policy. These Government proposals would remove the right of local residents to comment on planning applications, in some circumstances. Richard made a speech at Sutton Council on 12 July attacking these proposals, which undermine local democracy.\nMORE TREES – TO IMPROVE AIR QUALITY AND COMBAT GLOBAL WARMING\nWe have a manifesto commitment to plant more trees, to improve air quality, combat global warming and promote the green, suburban feel of Sutton. We will be planting new trees in the next few months in Downside Road, Upland Road, Willis Avenue and Prior Avenue.\nWe were delighted when, in accordance with the commitment to plant more trees to combat global warming, two new trees were planted in early 2021 in The Ridgway. The story concerning the tree outside number 23 is interesting. Many years ago there was a tree pit here and a tree. The tree died. Contractors tarmaced over the tree pit. The tarmac would periodically sag. Richard suggested restoring the tree pit and planting a tree. This was done. The photo was taken during the brief fall of snow on 24 January 2021.\nSCHOOL STREET AT OVERTON GRANGE SCHOOL\nStudents returning to school at the start of the 2020 autumn term at Overton Grange enjoyed a quieter and safer atmosphere due to the introduction of a “school street” at the gates in Stanley Road at the time students arrived and left for the school day. This involved the closure of the part of Stanley Road adjacent to the school for a short period in the morning and afternoon, when the school day starts and ends.\nThe objectives of school streets are:\n1) To improve safety around the school at start and finish time\n2) To improve air quality for children outside their school gates (small people are particularly vulnerable to emissions from cars)\n3) To create a more welcoming atmosphere around the school, where children can walk in the road and parents can feel more relaxed.\nThe scheme was a six month trial funded by Transport for London, who set the parameters of the scheme. The scheme was withdrawn in advance of the conclusion of the six month trial following a legal challenge to the lawfulness of such schemes, but by then it was proposed to withdraw the scheme. This related to difficulties experienced in enforcing the traffic controls, which at successful “school street” schemes involved the participation of the school and parents.\nMORE TREES, TO COUNTER GLOBAL WARMING\nOne of the ways to combat global warming is to plant more trees. Richard and Trish have been responsible for getting the Council to plant many trees in our Ward, some to replace trees that were lost to disease but many new trees. Trees absorb carbon dioxide and pollution, and pump out oxygen. Sutton is amongst the leaders among the 32 London boroughs in the number of street trees per yard of pavement. This contributes to the pleasant, green, suburban atmosphere of the area we all so much enjoy, though it creates a headache every autumn when the leaves fall.\nThis planting activity has included trees in:\nUpland Road – outside 18, 20, 39. 103\nCamborne Road – outside 47/49, 32/34\nEffingham Close – 17, 26\nLangley Park Road – opposite 91 Egmont\nDevonshire Road – outside the school\nThe Ridgway – 18, 59\nChristchurch Park – one outside, and one opposite, White Lodge Close.",

We are now reasonably certain that this ambition will be realised by next February.\nOn 10 September Richard attended the Project Board for the Sutton Gateway Project. This project is designed to improve the “Gateway to Sutton” from the south, along the Brighton Road and around Sutton station. The main elements include:\n– opening the side entrance to the station\n– further development of the facilities for cyclists\n– re-design of the steep steps up to the side entrance so they are at an acceptable angle\n– better landscaping, street furniture and paving around this area and the station entrance area.\nThe station manager confirmed that the side entrance would be manned from 7am to 7pm and at other times open but monitored on screens at the front entrance.\nRichard says “For twenty years of my life I commuted into London for work, walking every morning past the barricaded and barriered side entrance round to the front to catch (or just miss) my train, and in the evening – since the station is officially classified as overcrowded – shuffling in a mass of people to get out the front. All our local residents who commute to London, walking down Wellesley Road from the east end of the Ward, will benefit from the overdue decision to open the side entrance. And it will benefit all those who arrive at Sutton station to work in The Quadrant.”\nThe project will also involve some re-design of the Cedar Road junction, long a concern of ours, and a “stakeholder group” to include trepresntatives of the South Sutton Neighbourhood Association and the Highfields Residents’ Association will be asked to comment on design issues.",

Councillor Mary Burstow drew attention to her submission.\nWe know that many of our residents, with our proximity to Sutton station being a reason to live in our Ward, commute into London every day to work. Richard and Heather themselves did this for many years. Some commute to north London and the proposal to terminate Sutton’s Capital Connect trains at Blackfriars will add more than ten minutes in each direction to their daily commute, almost two hours extra down time a week. Taken with the effect of cutting us off from international services at St. Pancras, and Luton airport, and the fact that our ability to attract businesses to Sutton has been greatly enhanced by our good transport links, this proposal has to be resisted.\nThe most recent stage in what will be a battle with further, continuing stages was the combined Thameslink franchise consultation on which responses were required by mid-September.\nRichard commented, in the discussion “The reputation of civil servants at the Department of Transport, following the West Coast Main Line fiasco, is not high, and having worked there during the time that I was chair of the Channel tunnel Safety Authority, I am not altogether surprised. We will need to be vigilant in watching and contributing to the further steps in this process.\nI know that the way responses to consultation are analysed in the Department means that the volume of reaction is important. Councillor Honour and I put in our own response on behalf of our residents. Councillor Burstow did the same. ”\nRichard made some suggestions to prepare ourselves for the further stages.\n“First, I suggest that all those Councillors who put in submissions send them to the secretary so they can be included – along with his helpful note – with the papers for this meeting, so they are on the record to be used as necessary as an information quarry in further stages.\nSecond, we should consider, if it is appropriate at a later stage, passing a motion drawing attention to the difficulties this proposal causes for our residents, and send it to the Secretary of State, and seek a reply.\nThis is an important issue for our residents. On 23 August I presented a petition signed by over 5 000 residents, largely developed through Paul Burstow’s website, at the Department for Transport in Marsham Street, and the numbers wanting to sign shows how significant this is.”",

At the Sutton Council meeting on 9 May 2011 the pavilion was included in the list of buildings to be added to the Sutton Local List.\nThis is the only building in Sutton South Ward to be included on the Local List, though the Registry Office in Worcester Road is on the national list of Listed Buildings.\nThe building is the only one of the buildings put forward as additions during the consultation process to make it to the final list. This was attributed to the fact that Councillor Clifton had put forward a carefully researched case, including adequate evidence.\nThe Sutton Local List is a list of buildings thought to be of importance to the comunity, though not of sufficient merit to be “Listed Buildings” for inclusion on the national list. The list thus includes local buildings of significance to the local community. Sutton Council has been consulting on additions to the Local List and, at a presentation to the Sutton South, Cheam and Belmont Local Committee on 27 January, it became evident that not one single building in Sutton South Ward was under consideration for inclusion on the local list. This led to Councillor Clifton proposing inclusion of the pavilion.\nThe inclusion of the pavilion on the list may be helpful in the preservation of the character of this area as an Area of Special Local Character (ASLC), and thus resisting any inappropriate development in the area, such as demolition of houses and erection of blocks of flats, which has been the trend in adjacent areas. At a Planning Appeal attended by Councillor Clifton last year he had to explain to the Inspector the importance of local people of the ASLC and why it should be taken into account in the planning decision.\nCouncillor Clifton said:\n“I am delighted with this outcome. One of our key objectives, as local Councillors, is to preserve the character of the Area of Special Local Character at the east end of Sutton South Ward. We must resist the trend to knock down houses and build small blocks of flats, which has led to a shortage of family homes in many parts of Sutton South Ward, and half the children living in accommodatin with no access to a garden. This recognition of the importance of buildings such as the Edwardian tennis club to the special character of the area may be helpful to us in pursuing that objective.”\nIn proposing the pavilion, Councillor Clifton wrote:\n“It is an Edwardian tennis pavilion, built in 1908 by the local architect Percy Vere Windebank, on the triangle of land at the junction of Mayfield Road and The Ridgway, in South Sutton Ward. It is a relatively unaltered example of a small, Edwardian tennis club pavilion, though the windows have been altered in an unsympathetic manner.\nThe history of the building is interesting. Up to 1906 this area was lavender fields. Between 1906 and 1914 Windebank laid out the Highfields Estate, building what is now The Ridgway, Mayfield Road , Chalgrove Road and Hillcroome Road . The concept was an estate of large, expensive houses with large gardens, grouped around or close to a triangle of land on which there would be a lawn tennis and croquet club, for the benefit of the residents. In 2008 the Highfields Residents’ Association published a history of the estate, “Highfields 100”, to mark the centenary. A copy of this history, to which Councillor Clifton is listed as a contributor, is obtainable from Mr Keith Percy at 63 The Ridgway, SM2 5JX. The houses are of some architectural merit, as indicated in the history.\nWe believe the pavilion was built by 1908, as the Highfield Lawns tennis club was in existence by that year. On 22 August 1908 an advertisement for the first of the newly-built houses on the estate was published in the Surrey County Herald newspapers, and mentioned the private tennis club on the estate. Highfield Lawns Ltd. was established as a company by 1913 with the sole objective of owning the land in order to allow the tennis and croquet club to operate. Those who bought one of Windebank’s houses could buy shares in Highfield Lawns. The Articles of Association of the company provide, to this day, that if you own a share in the company you can only vote on its affairs if you also own property in the Highfields Estate.\nOver the years the large gardens have been sold off for infill housing, mostly of a good quality. The area is designated an Area of Special Local Character (ASLC) and the Edwardian tennis pavilion is central to the character of the area. Were it to be proposed to demolish and re-build the pavilion any replacement would need to be a building of a similar character (not a modern building or a concrete slab) due to the ASLC designation. If the Local List is a list of buildings of some local significance, the pavilion should be on the list. This is based on criteria 3, a building of significant local interest.”\nCouncillors Clifton and Honour would welcome information on any famous people who have lived in Sutton South Ward, for consideration as to whether there should be a plaque erected on the property where they lived.\nThis is a picture of the clubhouse taken from the triangle in The Ridgway. A photograph taken in 1913 shows an almost identical scene.",

Club meets at Christ Church Community Hall for tea and coffee, activities and informal advice if someone has a worry or a problem.\nThere is one telephone number, 020 8770 4065 manned by SCILL (Sutton Centre for Independent Living and Learning), that people can phone if they, or someone they know, needs support because they are lonely or isolated. They can be put in touch with someone who can offer them befriending or more professional help if that is needed. We are also looking for volunteers to help with the project, all skills welcome, and the contact telephone number is the same.\nThe Safer Neighbourhoods police team were at the launch, as well as the mobile library service , AgeUK, other voluntary organisations, and Heather and Richard. There was plenty of tea and cake.\nThe Hello! project will also feature at the Sutton South, Cheam and Belmont Local Committee on 23 May at the same venue. Residents are invited for refreshments at 6pm before a discussion of the scheme at 6.30pm.”",

There has been some misunderstanding about the origin of these proposals and their likely impact. Richard, who spoke at the meeting to remind the Committee of the implications for South Sutton, explains as follows.\n“This scheme has been under consideration for about five years. It arises from developments at the Royal Marsden Hospital that had the effect of putting pressure on parking in neighbouring roads. It was agreed, some years ago, to fund, from section 106 money provided by the Marsden (so the cost is not a charge on Sutton Council tax payers), consultation with local residents on parking schemes. The original proposals, for roads close to the Marsden, would have led to some displacement of parking into roads further afield and the consultation was stopped, then resumed over a wider area. Eventually much of Belmont Ward was included in the consultation, including roads that are far removed from the Marsden such as Egmont Road.\nThe roads adjacent to our Ward covered in the latest consultation that could lead to displacement into Sutton South are the small part of Langley Park Road south of the junction with Chalgrove Road, the part of Devonshire Road south of Egmont Road, and Egmont Road. The latest round of consultation produces strange results. The response rate of residents in Devonshire Road was less than 20% – implying most of them are not fussed about parking – and in Egmont Road it was only 8%. This is not a mandate for change. The decision taken at the Local Committee on 23 February was to have a further round of consultation in these roads.\nAs Liberal Democrats we support localism – ensuring decisions are taken at the local, community level wherever possible – so we support the delegation of decisions on parking schemes to Local Committees, though our Party is in a minority on our Local Committee. This set of proposals, under discussion for five years, was well advanced when we were elected in 2010 so we cannot stop it progressing. What we can do is look out for the interests of our residents.\nAt the Local Committee on 23 February, we:\n– expressed concern at the possibility of displacement of parking into neighbouring roads in Sutton South Ward, if any of these schemes were to be introduced after the next round of consultation\n– proposed that if any changes were introduced there should be monitoring of displacement into roads in Sutton South Ward, and, if displacement arises, consultation with residents in our area on whether further parking controls are necessary.\nWe will seek to ensure this happens. Let us know your views.”",

A resident suggested this was about the point where someone walking back from the station with a takeaway snack would finish it and drop rubbish.\nRe-surfacing of Hillcroome Road to deal with potholes after the hard winter of 2009/2010.\nImprovements to the layout of the Brighton Road at the junction with Ventnor Road and Devonshire Avenue, to reduce road accidents.\nImprovements made in relation to signage and road markings outside Overton Grange school due to concerns about road safety when students leave the school at the end of the day. A new, flashing “wig wag” sign (it flashes when switched on at about the time students arrive at or leave school) erected.\nThis is the “wig wag” sign.\nExpansion of Devonshire Avenue, The Avenue and Barrow Hedges primary schools will make it easier for Sutton South parents to get their children into these excellent, popular and frequently over-subscribed schools. We also succeeded in moving the polling stations from Devonshire and Barrow Hedges schools to local church halls, so the education of the children will not be disrupted for a day and related child care problems can be avoided.\nExtension of the “No Drinking Zone” into Sutton South Ward, to deal with issues of anti-social behaviour associated with a group of “all day drinkers” who tend to congregate on the corner of Cedar Road and Brighton road, the location shown in this picture.\nRepresentations made by your local Liberal Democrat Councillors to contribute to Sutton-wide response to Transport for London consultation on the future of the X26 Croydon to Heathrow service, the 80 service from Sutton station to Belmont and the 280 Tooting to Belmont service, to stress the importance to local people of these services.\nSupport for the creation of more “car club” bays in Sutton South Ward, such as this bay in Albion Road which was identified for conversion to a “car club” bay, in order to encourage better car use, reducing pollution, a “greener” Borough and policy on sustainable transport. This proposal is currently on hold but Car2go have expanded their car club service in the Ward.\nNew street trees planted, such as this one in Copse Hill. And in Copse Hill we also intervened to get Council officials to look at the potential for a flooding problem at the foot of the hill, with the cleaning out of the soakaways and other improvements.\nAction to improve the Devonshire Avenue Nature Area, involving, amongst other things, re-positioning the benches, partially removing a wall that divides up the site, possibly fencing some areas with low wooden fencing to protect the kidney vetch essential for the small blue buterfly, removing the corrugated iron sheeting found at the site and installing a small piece of play equipment for children aged 5 to 7 at the entrance, while taking action to control the habitat. The reserve is the only open space in the Ward. We have supported only limited installation of play equipment as we believe the area should continue to be a nature reserve, and our proposals are designed to ensure the habitat of the area will not be harmed. We are promoting a programme to assist the small blue butterfly.\nAction to improve the safety of pedestrians who pass under the railway bridge in Grange Vale. There is a narrow pavement and, as it is a one-way street, cars roar round the corner from the Brighton Road end and under the bridge, the driver only seeing a pedestrian on the pavement under the bridge at the last moment. This is a particular problem for parents with buggies or with small children passing under the bridge against the direction of traffic. A barrier and set of posts have been erected to slow the traffic.\nThis photo shows the improvement made.\nAction taken to discuss with BT the installation of the new generation of very large green cabinets at locations in the Ward, to ensure they are put in locations that do not cause annoyance to residents, as this box in Cedar Road does. Action to prevent the boxes being covered with unsightly advertising.\nAction to promote the sensitive re-development of Sutherland House, which is currently an eyesore, and to ensure that if it is re-developed there will be gains for the residents of the Ward through a programme of improvements funded by the developer, through the community infrastructure levy and section 106 contributions.\nAction to get the Edwardian tennis pavilion in Mayfield Road included on the Sutton Local List as a building of significant local historical importance and interest.\nCampaign launched to stop Thameslink services being terminated at Blackfriars, something that would lead to dispersion of commuters onto other services that are already packed, cut Sutton off from St. Pancras International and north London, and harm the attractiveness of Sutton to companies locating their offices away from but close to central London.\nA programe of road maintenence throughout the Ward – this picture shows line painting in Eaton Road.\nThe side entrance at Sutton station\nOur campaign continues to get the side entrance to Sutton station opened. A bid submitted by Sutton Council for funding from the Mayor’s Outer London Fund was not successful, but the campaign continues and a further bid (to TfL) has been successful. This is not the end of the story as negotiations continue on matched funding..\nWe succeeded in getting the date for the four-yearly pruning of the thousand or so street trees in Sutton South Ward brought forward to the end of 2011.

The conditions in the agreement include:\n- The dog being kept on a lead no longer than three metres in a public place including Langley Park Road, public footpaths and roads within Sutton borough\n- Clearing up after her dog\n- Regularly exercising her dog\nFailure to comply with the agreement may result in an Anti-Social Behaviour Order being obtained to stop the resident causing harassment, alarm or distress and the tenancy agreement being reviewed and even revoked.\nThe action is part of borough’s Local Environmental Awareness of Dogs (LEAD) initiative to make owners of all breeds of dog aware of their responsibilities to their pet and the wider community.\nSince August 2011 a total of 27 letters have been sent to residents whose dogs have come to the notice of police.\nPC Heath Keogh, of Sutton Police station, who is co-ordinating the LEAD initiative for the borough, said: “Whilst we want to work with residents to reduce the nuisance and concerns caused by their pets, we are equally determined that we will take whatever action we need to make sure that this happens in reality.\n“The bottom line for Sutton residents is a breach of an ASBO which could result in five years jail or a fine or both, and a possession order leading to a tenant’s eviction, for those in rented accommodation.”\nThe LEAD initiative was prompted by the fatal dog attack in Demesne Road, Wallington, on 23 December 2010, when a 52-year-old woman died after being attacked by a dog.",

He said:\n“We all know the importance to Sutton of maintaining a through rail service to north London.\nI want to stress the importance of links to St Pancras International as St Pancras develops further as an international rail hub.\nOver the next few years there will be a positive mushrooming of international rail travel from London. If the current plans of Deutschbahn and Eurostar come to fruition, by 2014 it will be possible, on arriving at St Pancras, to have a choice of services to travel from London to Amsterdam.\nIn addition to the current services to Brussels and Paris there will also be services from London to North Germany. This is a big market in terms of business travel. At present, each day, about 30 planes fly from London’s airports to destinations in north Germany, carrying about the same number of people as could be carried by just a few trains, using the Velaro D trains that are being built to provide rolling stock for these new services from London, by the train manufacturer Siemens at its Dusseldorf factory, which in fact I visited recently.\nAside from the potential importance of these international links to the residents of Sutton, there are international companies that have significant centres of their enterprises in Sutton – Sutton, a thriving London suburb, offering office space much cheaper than that found in the centre of London, less than half an hour by train from the centre, with a pleasant ambience and environment, and a location from which – importantly – you can reach the centre of Brussels in just two train journeys, one taking about 40 minutes and one about 2 hours. And the centre of Paris in just 15 minutes more. And soon – Amsterdam, north Germany.\nNow, these are transport links that it is vital for Sutton to maintain, for the sake of our residents but also to maintain our attractiveness as a centre for business development. When I look at the data on economic activity that comes regularly to the new Housing, Economy and Business committee, some clear conclusions stand out. It is clear that Sutton is doing relatively well in terms of surviving the recession and maintaining one of the highest rates of economic activity on the part of its residents of any part of London. But we need to continue to attract new businesses.\nThe Tramlink extension is perhaps equally important, particularly in relation to the north Sutton site, which is an attractive site, and on which the Housing, Economy and Business committee now has a task group working on the planning brief. Our current plans include scope for a Tramlink stop at the site, something that will greatly enhance its appeal, and we see this development as an important part of our future growth strategy.\nSo we must keep pressure on TfL to continue work on the feasibility of the Sutton Tramlink proposal, and make clear to the Department for Transport that changes that remove our linoks to north London and in particular to St Pancras, are not acceptable.\nThe Thameslink service is absolutely vital. Losing it would sever our only direct link to North London and would mean Sutton residents would need to take at least two trains to get to St Pancras. It is quite scandalous that, at a time when we should be improving public transport, there is a serious proposal to cut the link between North and South London.”\nWe need to act now as the Department for Transport is currently consulting on the new seven-year Thameslink franchise which will run from September next year and incorporate the Southern franchise from 2015.\nIronically, the cross-London Loop Line service which runs through Sutton, Carshalton and Hackbridge stations, was recently reopened at nights and weekends after being split for three and a half years by engineering work. It is all very well reopening it now, but Sutton’s residents need the line to stay open for good.\nThe new franchise will set service patterns for 2018 and beyond, so it is vital that we act now and do not become a Cinderella area for rail transport.\nTo view the DfT consultation document visit www.dft.gov.uk/consultations\nTo give your input into Sutton’s response, email alex.forrest@sutton.gov.uk\nRichard and Heather will be submitting their own response.\nMore detail about the attitude the Council is taking, opposing this threat, is in a further post on this site “Train Links To North London Must Remain” (see archive July 2011).\nHeather and Richard outside Sutton station",

To ensure a consistent approach throughout the Borough, all local schemes will be drawn into a central strategy and progressed on the basis of an assessment of priorities.\nAn ambitious scheme for the introduction of a 20mph scheme across most of the area of Sutton South Ward west of the Sutton to Belmont railway line has now been included in the “Local Implementation Plan” prepared by Transport for London. This was the subject of proposals put to the local committee in 2015. However, it is on the “reserve list” which means that implementation in the near future is most unlikely.\nA parking scheme for the newly-named Berridge Close is agreed, implementation to coincide with the opening of the adjacent Subsea7 building, as this will lead to more intensive use of the road by those working in the building and accessing the underground car park. Obstructive parking in Berridge Close could lead to problems when the building is occupied, so needs to be avoided. It is proposed that the road will be included in the controlled parking zone with four parking bays in the road, reserved for residents with parking permits. Completion of the building is unlikely before December.\nTraffic and parking schemes were the subject of a session at the December 2015 meeting of the South Sutton, Cheam and Belmont Local Committee, when residents noted down parking and traffic problems. A list of the proposals raised by residents was reported back to the local committee meeting on 10 March.\nIn relation to our own area, the proposals fell into three main categories.\nFirst, concerns about intensive and sometimes obstructive parking in Mayfield Road and roads nearby (The Ridgway, Chalgrove Road, Upland Road).\nSecond, concerns about visibility at the Farm Road / The Ridgway junction.\nThird, a set of other concerns, mostly about speeding at various locations.\nThis listing will form the agenda for further work by the traffic department within a wider cross-Borough study, which is centrally managed by the Council. A number of minor, initial proposals were agreed on 10 March, including to restrict parking at the Prior Avenue / Banstead Road junction due to visibility issues.\nThe question of a parking control scheme in Mayfield Road and the surrounding area was the subject of a consultation exercise by local Councillors last year which showed support in Mayfield Road but not adjacent roads. On 10 March the local committee agreed to devote some of its public realm funds to fund the traffic department to “kick start” a study of potential for parking controls in this area. A discussion between traffic engineers and Ward Councillors to consider this study was held on 8 June in Mayfield Road. The traffic engineers will design a parking control scheme for consultation. The precise parameters of this scheme and the consultation have yet to be finalised. Consultation with residents is due to begin in January 2017.\nSome residents of Audley Place have commented to us that there is difficulty when driving out of Audley Place in seeing vehicles coming down Camborne Road, if cars are parked close to the corner. We raised this issue with traffic engineers and the Council is proposing a small extension of the yellow lines on each side at the exit from Audley Place. We think this will do the trick in terms of making it easier, and safer, to drive out into Camborne Road.\nResidents of Tapestry Close have complained to us about obstructive parking in the Close. We raised this issue with traffic engineers and a scheme of yellow lining was proposed. Further consultation with residents, required by law, found some residents objecting and this scheme is currently on hold.\nSeveral schemes consulted on some time ago have now been implemented, including yellow lining at the bottom of Downside Road to deal with obstructive parking (see photo above) and switching some “pay and display” bays to “dual use” so residents with parking permits can use them, in Grange Road and Langley Park Road.",

Like all London boroughs we have had to deal with the bulge in pupil numbers. This has gone through the primary school system and our excellent local primary schools in this area have been able to cope, with most parents still getting their first choice of school. Many secondary schools in Sutton have expanded, including our popular local school Overton Grange, but two new secondary schools will still be needed and are planned. The new Harris Academy, integrated into the Sutton Cancer Hub development, is already proving popular with parents who plan to apply for places next year. Parents can be reassured that Sutton will be able to cope with the increased numbers without a fall in the high quality of local education or unacceptable congestion problems at the schools, which the schools have plans in place to cope with.\nSTUNNING SUCCESS FOR SUTTON IN 2017 LONDON NEW YEAR’S DAY PARADE\nThe float entered by the London Borough of Sutton won fourth prize in the 2017 London New Year’s Day Parade, our best result in over a decade and a stunning achievement given the stiff competition from other London Boroughs.\nHONOURING OUR ARMED FORCES\nOn 20 June Trish and Richard attended the flag raising ceremony, raising the Armed Forces Day flag in Sutton Town Square, to honour our armed services. This marked the start of Armed Forces Week. Richard, as Mayor, led the event.\nRichard said “Our Armed Forces are busy working around the world, promoting peace, delivering aid, tackling drug smugglers, tackling people smugglers, providing security, fighting terrorism. They work in difficult, dangerous and unpleasant conditions away from their families and the luxuries we all take for granted. They operate in environments where the very basics of security and safety are absent. They face, daily, a daunting challenge, doing work that is vital to the protection of our society and our way of life. we now watch with pride as the Armed Forces Day flag is raised for those who are currently serving and those who have served.”\nOn 25 June Richard visited the army centre in Stonecot Hill (see photo) and observed the work of 151 Logistics Corps. On 20 July he attended a reception given by 151 Logistics Corps at which there was stirring rendition of “Highland Cathedral” (a composition popular with the concert bands Richard plays with) by the Ghurka pipe and drum band.\nGETTING YOUR FIRST CHOICE OF SECONDARY SCHOOL\nEvery borough in London is struggling to keep place with the increasing demand for school places. Sutton has done well to cope with the increased demand for primary school places. The bulge is now working its way through to secondary schools. Hence the need for Overton Grange school (the only secondary school in our Ward) to expand, and the need for a new school.\nSutton is doing well. It has the third-highest first-preference rate for secondary school places in London, with almost 80 per cent of local families receiving their first choice of school for their child – well above the London average of 68.52 per cent.\nSutton has once again achieved one of the best rates overall, with the percentage of families receiving one of their top-three preferences increasing to 94.5 per cent – up 1.5 per cent from 2015 and almost six percentage points above the London average of 88.64 per cent.\nParents in the borough have been told which secondary schools have made offers of places for their children for the September 2016 intake.\nIn September, these children will start at our secondary schools, officially ranked as being among the best in England for teaching and exam results. In 2015, the proportion of Sutton students scoring 5 or more A* to C grades including English and Maths was 76.9 per cent, well above the 2014 national average of 53.4 per cent. Across the borough, 83.5 per cent of pupils achieved five or more GCSEs.\nAlmost two-thirds (65.1 per cent) of students across the borough achieved the highest A-Level A*, A and B grades in 2015 and the percentage of Sutton students achieving an A-Level pass grade (A* to E) increased to 99.7 per cent from 98.5 per cent in 2014. This was well above the UK average.\nSCHOOL PLACES FOR LOCAL CHILDREN ASSURED\nSutton Council’s Planning Committee, which Richard chairs, has agreed expansion plans for Overton Grange school, the only secondary school in Sutton South Ward.\nSutton Council, like every London Borough, has been pursuing a strategy to cope with the increased demand for school places. Having successfully coped with a surge in demand for primary school places, the bulge is now moving through to secondary schools. The Council continues to work on its proposals for at least one new secondary school in Sutton, while almost all of the existing secondary schools – including Overton Grange – are submitting plans to expand the number of places.\nOverton Grange school is the only secondary school in our Ward and, while it takes students from all over Sutton, many local parents send their children there. Like many Sutton schools, it is planning to expand its intake to meet the additional demand for secondary school places in the Borough due to rising numbers of children. Currently the school takes in 210 students each year and it plans to expand the school by increasing its intake by a class of 30 each year from autumn 2016.\nThe school, which has “Academy” status so it is not under the control of the local authority, staged an exhibition of its building plans on 22 April, at the school. A new teaching block is proposed, and the school is taking the opportunity of the building work to expand its canteen, which is not large enough for the current size of the school.\nAt the time of the last local elections, last May, scare stories were put round that the school planned to expand into Overton Park. This is not the case.\nRichard said, after the Planning Committee decision ” The rising number of children reaching secondary school age means that expansion of our schools is necessary, alongside the proposals for new schools, and I am pleased the Council is taking effective action to avert any crisis in school places. I am pleased there is no intention to expand into the park, a story that had no foundation and was a political scare story.”\nOverton Grange plans to expand its intake by 30 pupils per year, a one form intake, from the autumn of 2016. The Planning Committee considered a report on an application for the erection of a part ground, part first, part second floor extension, to provide five additional classrooms with ancillary accommodation, three single storey extensions to provide additional canteen, kitchen and storage facilities, together with roof canopy to the main front entrance, a detached store, with soft and hard landscaping.\nOverton Grange is a popular local school and this extension will continue to ensure there are sufficient places locally for children reaching secondary school age, so this is good news for the many parents in the area who have young children. Secondary school provision in the area will be further enhanced by the decision to build the first of the new secondary schools we need on the nearby Sutton hospital site.\nONE PLANET SUTTON\nOn 15 July Sutton Council debated our on-going commitment to the sustainability agenda and Sutton’s desire to be London’s most sustainable suburb. Sutton is ranked the highest outer London Borough in having the lowest CO2 emissions.\nWe represent Sutton South Ward, which has only one open space, the Devonshire Avenue Nature Area, an oasis of open space in an area dominated by small blocks of flats, where a study showed half the children live in properties without a garden. We think it commendable that Sutton Council has ensured that this site remains a nature reserve. But a few years ago that meant leaving it as jungle. It was little used, except for anti-social happenings behind the brick walls that still occupied part of the site. Today it remains a nature area, aiding the survival of the rare small blue butterfly (a talisman of Sutton South Ward), but it has benches, paths and a nature trail. We wanted to take the opportunity the motion afforded to pay tribute to Sutton Nature Conservation Volunteers, who maintain the site, and to those who distribute the funds to aid community projects provided by the landfill operator Viridor, whose funding, in 2012, paid for the renovation of the site.\nMAJOR COMMUNITY AWARD – AND NEW EXHIBITION – FOR SUTTON SOUTH HELLO!\nOn 26 March the Sutton South Hello! Thursday afternoon group launched a major exhibition of their work at the Council’s historic museum Honeywood, in Carshalton. The launch was well attended and our picture shows Heather Honour with the Mayor of Sutton, Councillor Arthur Hookway, the Care Minister Norman Lamb MP (who launched the Hello! project on 9 May 2012, see below) and local MP Paul Burstow.\nOn 24 February 2015 Sutton South Hello! received an award in the Sutton Community Awards annual awards ceremony. This was in the “Community Spirit” category for actions that have brought the community together through community events. The photo shows the Hello! team with the certificate. Left to right the Hello! team who came up to collect the award are Colin Iddles (chair of South Sutton Neighbourhood Association), Gerry Benworth (Skill), Fran Wilson (secretary of the Hello! board), Heather Honour (Chair and Founder), Nedal Ali, Councillor Nali Patel.\nSouth Sutton Hello! is the brainchild of our former Liberal Democrat Councillor Heather Honour, an initiative to combat loneliness and isolation. It is supported by major local charities like AgeUK, Citizens’ Advice Bureau, Sutton Mental Health Foundation, and local residents’ Associations such as the South Sutton Neighbourhood Association and the Highfields Residents’ Association. Heather chairs the Board and has been the driving force behind the project.\nIt was launched at Christchurch, in Christchurch Park, on 9 May 2012 by the Care Minister, Liberal Democrat MP Norman Lamb, and is intended to be a pilot for similar initiatives elsewhere. There are now similar Hello! clubs elsewhere in Sutton, such as Worcester Park.\nSutton South Ward was chosen as, on the basis Campaign to End Social Isolation toolkit, it is a ward where the risk of social isolation is particularly high:\n– the Ward has the highest proportion of over 65’s of any Ward in Sutton\n– the proportion over 85 is double the Sutton and national average\n– there are a large number of people living in sheltered accommodation for the elderly or in single occupancy flats\n– over three quarters of residents live in purpose-built blocks of flats\n– almost half of all households are single person households\n– but a quarter of residents in the Ward say they regularly volunteer in some capacity, so there is a high level of community activism.\nThe project has drawn together a listing of the various community initiatives in Sutton South, particularly those run by the churches and AgeUK. It has produced newsletters. There are a number of specific activities it has promoted, in particular the Wednesday “Hello Club” at Christchurch and a Thursday club on craft activities. The project has been aided in setting up these activities by SCILL (Sutton Centre for Independent Living and Learning) and AgeUK\nAgeUK has assisted with the organisation of chair based exercises. Councillor Nali Patel often attends and forms a link with the Sutton and Surrey Senior Citizens Club, which meets at the Thomas Wall Centre and is in particular a friendship club for Asians living in Sutton. Other activities in the Ward include the “Second Saturday” social club for older people at the Friends’ Meeting House on the second Saturday of each month.\nAgeUK say there has been a 106% increase in callers from our Ward to its Information and Advice service since the project started promoting it. The project is seeking volunteers, particularly as befrienders. These are organised by the Sutton Centre for Independent Living and Learning (Skill). There is a phone number 0208 770 4065, or email information@scill.org.uk.\nNEW COMMUNITY GARDEN OPENED AT CHRISTCHURCH\nOn 24 March Richard attended the opening of the new community garden at Christchurch. This is a remarkable piece of work to turn a scrubby bit of wasteland into something attractive and useful, funded by lottery money, the church and the Council.\nThe picture shows left to right our MP Paul Burstow, the Mayor, the Reverend Justine Middlemiss (of the Christchurch team Ministry), the Bishop of Croydon and the Reverend Mark Pullinger (the vicar of Christchurch) at the opening. The Bishop blessed the garden.\nGOOD OFSTED REPORT ON DEVONSHIRE AVENUE PRIMARY SCHOOL\nTrish and Richard have welcomed a further OFSTED report on the progress of Devonshire Avenue primary school that gives the school a good rating. On 23 March Richard visited the school to see the Head, Mr Kersey, and congratulate him.\nThe school achieved “good” ratings in five separate assessment categories:\nLeadership and management – Good\nBehaviour and safety of pupils – Good\nQuality of teaching – Good\nAchievement of pupils – Good\nEarly years provision – Good\nThe summary of key findings prepared by OFSTED is reproduced below/\n“Summary of key findings for parents and pupils\nThis is a good school Under the good leadership of the headteacher and deputy headteacher, there has been a successful drive to improve pupils’ achievement and the quality of teaching. They are well supported by other senior leaders, staff and governors. Consequently, the dip in pupils’ performance which occurred after the last inspection has been successfully addressed. Pupils make good progress from their well below average starting points. By Year 6, their attainment in reading, writing and mathematics is now above average. Pupils of all abilities achieve well with an increasing number making rapid progress in response to stimulating teaching. Improvement is particularly evident in writing which has, rightly, been a focus for development. A very careful watch is kept on the progress of all pupils. Any pupils falling behind because they find learning difficult are quickly given extra help. Provision and children’s progress in the Nursery is outstanding. Exciting learning opportunities encourage children to enjoy learning. Good progress in Reception ensures children get off to a good start. Teaching is good. There are good systems to develop it further. Staff value the support provided by school leaders to help them improve their teaching. School leaders have robust systems for promoting safeguarding. Pupils say they feel safe and are kept safe. They have good attitudes to learning and most behave well both in and out of the classroom. Most parents agree that behaviour is good. Governors give good levels of challenge to school leaders. They have a very detailed knowledge of the school and share everyone’s ambitions for continuous improvement.”\nOur picture, above, is of Trish and Richard at the school in front of the artwork that the pupils prepared that now adorns the hoarding at the Subsea7 site in Brighton Road.\nGOOD NEWS FOR SUTTON’S THEATRES\nThe show will go on for both of Sutton’s theatres which are set to be taken over a new theatre company to herald an exciting new era for the two venues.\nThe Sutton Theatres Trust will take over the running of the Charles Cryer Studio Theatre in Carshalton and the Secombe Theatre in Sutton.\nSutton Council began a review of its cultural services in August, through its Sutton’s Future campaign, which involves the pubic in helping to reshape Council services in order to make £40m of savings to its annual budget by 2019 due to unprecedented Government cuts.\nThe Council promised to consult users and try to find arts groups who could take over the ownership and management of the two theatres with no cost to the Council.\nThrough a series of meetings and workshops with potential bidders and 1,262 responses to an online and telephone survey, we have found the right candidate to take the theatres over and keep them open.\nSutton Theatres Trust, a company limited by guarantee, will lease both theatres for a 10-year period after being chosen from two bids on the basis of artistic and community value, financial stability and sustainability, governance and track record.",

It also ordered the applicant Centro to pay for all the costs involved.\nThe decision paves the way for the council to continue the sale of the 1.36 acre site to Subsea 7 to expand its operations. The new development allows Subsea 7 to more than double its workforce over the coming years, preserves up to 780 jobs for Sutton, and makes the area more attractive for other firms to invest.\nIt is the third major investment secured by Sutton Council’s investment arm Opportunity Sutton in recent months with almost 500 new homes, retail and other commercial opportunities planned for the Sutton Point and the old gas works sites.\nThe High Court’s decision vindicates Sutton’s planning process. We now we have the green light to work with Subsea 7 to ensure Sutton benefits from a major investment, new jobs and other economic opportunities.\nOur Opportunity Sutton economic programme is working to attract new businesses and development, and in just 18 months of operation it has already attracted over £322 million in planned investment, including the new Subsea 7 office.\nWhile the Judicial Review application was waiting to be heard, Sutton Council had to pay for a package of security measures – expenses which could have been avoided if the JR application had not taken place.\nThe Council will now work with Subsea 7 for them to take responsibility for the site’s security arrangements – freeing the tax payer of this burden.\nThe plans are one of a number of high profile developments that Sutton has attracted through its inward investment arm Opportunity Sutton.\nLast summer developer CNM Estates was given the green light to extend the existing Sutton Point building next to Sutton Station to a 22 storey high building with two new buildings connected to it that altogether will offer deliver 300 apartments, a 130 bed hotel and shops and restaurants. The development could generate up to 750 jobs.\nIn October Sutton Council granted developer LXB Retail Properties permission to build 186 apartments, a supermarket, shops, restaurants and a public plaza on an old gas works site off the High Street. The development is expected to generate 500 jobs.\nThe Subsea7 project came about because last year a report by Sutton Council found that there were high levels of surplus parking spaces in council run car parks in the town centre – enough to absorb any displaced by the closure of Brighton Road Car Park. Since the closure of the car park, traffic monitoring has indicated that there have been no adverse effects on the parking or traffic in the town centre.\nThis project will bring jobs to the Ward, raise property prices as demand for local housing increases, and have an uplifting effect on the local economy with 800 workers spending money in local shops, hotels and restaurants.”",

As the restaurant is in our Ward, none of the Ward Councillors could sit as members of the sub-committee, as those taking the decision must be independent from any local influence. The committee considered whether this anti-social behaviour, involving the frequent playing of music at loud volume and thus disturbing local residents, was a breach of the licence conditions for regulated entertainment that governed the operation of the restaurant. The committee was concerned about the disturbance and decided to vary the licence of the restaurant to prevent the playing of live and recorded music as regulated entertainment at the premises. The owner has 21 days to appeal against the decision.\nThis is sad – but the owners of premises must recognise that licence conditions are imposed to protect the local residents and they will be enforced, so they cannot be ignored without there being consequences.",

The Council agreed a motion directed to the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government calling for a re-think. The motion criticised the proposed extension of permitted development rights and the envisaged interference of the Planning Inspectorate in local decisions on planning applications, affordable housing and section 106 contributions.\nHere is the full text of Richard’s Speech:\n“It is right that the London Borough of Sutton, which has been at the intellectual vanguard of so many policies in local Government, should be at the forefront in leading a campaign against the proposals of the Government to weaken planning law.\nThe motion is a balanced motion in that we are complimenting the Government on aspects of the announcement made on 6 September that we support, but we are making clear what we oppose.\nWe support proposals concerning the funding of new affordable housing, the refurbishment of empty homes, support for the FirstBuy shared equity scheme and support for housing associations.\nBut we are critical of the extension of permitted development rights, and the envisaged interference of the Planning Inspectorate in local decisions on planning applications, affordable housing and section 106 contributions.\nWhat we are saying tonight is entirely consistent with our actions and our words on planning issues.\nIt is consistent with our words in that we had an excellent debate on planning policy at the Council meeting on 17 October last year. I remember speaking in that debate and noting what we have achieved in Sutton in adopting and refining a planning policy that has secured the green, pleasant, suburban character of Sutton that we all treasure. But we noted in that debate threats and concerns that arose from national policy. We welcomed many aspects of the National Planning Policy Framework but saw four difficulties with the planning system that should be addressed – and for each of these I could cite specific examples in Sutton South Ward:\n1. that what is permitted development is already quite permissive and is leading to people building large and intrusive structures that should be brought within planning controls\n2. that the planning system is slow moving in dealing with developers who are recalcitrant and play the system\n3. the decisions of the Planning Inspectorate are sometimes inconsistent and unhelpful\n4. the Courts do not always seem to take breaches of planning law seriously.\nThese problems remain but, sadly, the Government has not taken our advice set out in the motion we passed. Indeed, it has moved in an opposite direction in what is now proposed.\nWhat is proposed seems to abandon the National Planning Policy Framework, does not address any of the problems that concerned us, and loosens further permitted development law.\nI do not believe for one second that the relaxation of requirements to seek planning permission for extensions to domestic properties is going to unleash an avalanche of building work, thus creating jobs. To the extent that this happens, it follows that this will be through the erection of buildings that would not be permitted under current arrangements. So this is a recipe for neighbourhood disputes and the erection of ugly buildings that society does not want, and that we certainly do not want in Sutton.\nI also particularly object to the way the package deals with affordable housing and section 106 contributions. Like most of you, I find that quite a lot of my casework as a Councillor involves families that are living in poor circumstances, often because they cannot find and afford accommodation that fits their needs. We desperately need more affordable housing. There are already “get out” clauses for developers who present financial analyses seemingly proving their development is unviable if they have to provide affordable housing. I am deeply suspicious of those processes and now there are to be further “get out” routes involving the Planning Inspectorate.\nWhat we say in this motion is also consistent with our actions. We have adopted stringent controls on development to ensure it meets the local needs of Sutton, particularly on the development of major sites and on back garden development. We do not want these interfered with by remote bodies in Whitehall and Bristol.\nWe have worked hard to control development in Sutton in a way that meets what local people want. And so much flows from the way the character of the area is preserved by our planning policies, making it an attractive environment for businesses and families. I never tire of telling people of the virtues of Sutton – low crime, good schools, attractive leafy streets, good transport connections, voted the best place in London to bring up children, a local economy that is surviving the recession well. All these things, to my mind, hinge crucially on having an attractive local environment and street scene.\nI hope these proposals will be re-thought.\nI strongly believe, in the words of the motion, that it is local people, through democratically elected local authorities, who are the best judges of what development is acceptable in an area.\nI commend this motion to Council.”",

There is immense competition between local authorities for job-creating inward investment. Jobs are gold dust.\nAs your local ward Councillors we are aware of residents’ concerns about the possible negative impact on parking in nearby streets. We explained these concerns very clearly at the Council meeting and the importance of encouraging car users to use the other public car parks nearby. We will continue to work to ensure that a proper solution is found.\nBoth of us spoke at the Committee meeting, welcoming the new jobs that will be created and calling for mitigation measures to deal with any impact on local parking. The Committee responded to this by agreeing that officers would look at mitigation measures including offering a substantial financial incentive to users of the Brighton Road car park to move to Gibson Road.\nRichard said “I am pleased the Committee responded to my concerns about the possible impact on parking by agreeing to examine mitigation measures including incentives to users to move to Gibson Road.”\nThe full text of Richard’s speech to the Committee is on his blog, for 8 April.\nJobs\n- Subsea 7 is a hi tech engineering company already based in Sutton. Any sensible local authority would welcome their expansion with open arms. Their further investment in Sutton safeguards the 350 jobs they already have here. Without this development they would move elsewhere because their current office space is no longer suitable.\n- Neither Sutherland House nor Sutton Point meet the needs of their business plans.\n- Their investment will bring around 400 new jobs to Sutton, some highly technical engineering jobs others support staff\n- The impact of the extra spending power in the local economy of these office workers and the company’s visiting clients will further stimulate and bring jobs to Sutton, jobs for a wide range of people, not just engineers.\nOpportunities for Sutton’s children\n- Subsea 7 is already works with local schools to stress the importance of studying maths and physics and explain how boys and girls can become engineers.

They are keen to do so.\nImprovements to the Area\n- The building will be designed by top class architects. It will be more attractive than the existing building and greatly improve the appearance of that part of the Brighton Road.\n- The area from the new Subsea 7 building up to Sutton Station will be upgraded as part of the Sutton Gateway plan.\n- This will include opening the side of the station, regenerating the immediate area, as well as improvements to the public areas of Brighton Road itself and the flow of traffic.\n- Talks are underway with Network Rail about adding another deck to the Station Car Park which will provide more car parking spaces for commuters and people working locally\nCar Parking\n- When it makes its planning application, Subsea 7 will provide a detailed report about the car parking issues which might arise from the redevelopment of the Brighton Road car Park and how to rectify them.\n- Council officers have planned that the 380 or so vehicles currently parking on weekdays in the Brighton Road Car Park should transfer to the nearby Gibson Road Car Park\n- We have asked the Council to provide financial incentives to make sure this happens. This will be discussed as part of the planning application\n- We have raised with Subsea 7 and the Council the concerns of the residents of Sutton Court, directly opposite the proposed new building, about non-resident car parking. We have asked Subsea 7 to assist with a residents’ car parking scheme. They are willing to meet residents and discuss this.\nA Can Do Attitude\nWe understand that residents have concerns and we are treating them very seriously. But we also recognise that we need new business, we need jobs and we need new skills for the children of Sutton. We want to welcome Subsea7, a top flight engineering company, to our area and work with Subsea 7, a company which wants to be involved in our community, and strike a blow against recession.",

The side entrance is now open from 6am to 11pm seven days a week.

In our Ward, a particular concern for the businesses was the need for a loading bay on Regents Parade just south of the station. We successfully lobbied for this to be incorporated into the scheme.\nThe improvements attributable to the Gateway project are complemented by the installation of the new zebra crossing in Cedar Road, which was not part of the project.",
  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_page_23/content_807.html": "With Mary Burstow and the bench we donated to Richard Sharples Court\nA REPORT ON MY FOUR YEARS AS A COUNCILLOR – By Richard\nThe work of a Councillor comprises the work you do for Sutton as a whole on Sutton Council and specific work for residents of the Ward.\nI have been the Vice-Chair of the Housing, Economy and Business Committee and “lead Councillor” on trading standards and on revenues and benefits. The two most challenging pieces of work I did were the re-design of the Council tax support scheme and the re-design of the Council’s committee system.\nThe Government “localised” Council tax support (the system of support payments to the most needy) by axing the national scheme. It invited local authorities to set up their own scheme but passed down to Councils only some of the funding. This cost Sutton £1.1 million. The challenge was to devise a local scheme which, while inevitably less generous, protected the vulnerable. The scheme I devised, which was ultimately accepted, provided support to those in most need and protected from cuts in benefit the elderly, the disabled, lone parents and families with small children. There were difficult choices and it was one of the most difficult projects I have undertaken in 40 years work in public administration.\nThe revision of the Council’s committee system I worked on was designed to take advantage of provisions in the Localism Act that made it possible to move from an “Executive” system to a “subject committee” system I considered more democratic. I led the group considering options and developed a scheme that was the basis for the system Sutton now has adopted.\nI also did a lot of work on a scrutiny of the Council’s policies on homelessness. This issue concerned me as I felt that some of the policies being recommended to us by Conservative Councillors would have increased homelessness, and the scrutiny activity demonstrated this.\nI have also been a member of the Audit Committee, the Scrutiny Committee, the Standards Committee, the Development Control Committee and the representative of Sutton on numerous external bodies and boards, such as the Downland Project (which organises volunteers to, for example, clear scrubland in local woods).\nWhen I was elected I obtained an exercise book (I do not trust computerised systems) and wrote on the cover “Casework.” Item number one was an issue raised by a resident of Copse Hill about a tree in the road demolished by a car. I got it replaced. My most recent entry in the Casework book (a disputed parking ticket I got rescinded) is item number 413, but this does not quite do me justice as some of these entries are multiple issues and some issues I was able to resolve almost immediately without resort to the “Casework” book.\nThere are some issues affecting the Ward as a whole that I have worked on that give me particular satisfaction – including the extension of the “no drinking zone” (controlling the drinking of alcohol in a public place) from the town centre to cover most of the Ward, the improvements to the Devonshire Avenue Nature Area while retaining its central purpose as a nature reserve, the safety improvements to the Grange Vale bridge, opening the side entrance to Sutton station (work now underway), getting more trees planted, helping found the Sutton South Hello! Project to tackle social isolation, getting funding for measures to combat speeding in Cavendish Road and Cedar Road, and securing 780 local jobs through the Subsea7 project (jobs are gold dust). The regular surgeries we have held have convinced me that there is a real issue for people in their 50s made redundant from work in getting back into the labour market, and the really big difference you can make to an area is ensuring there are local jobs. There are very few Councillors in Britain who can claim they have been instrumental in getting so many jobs for their area, given the massive competition between local authorities for such job-creating inward investment.\nThere were also many things I did for individual residents. Some of these projects gave me great satisfaction – such as getting a disabled parking bay moved so that it was not under a tree and thus the disabled resident did not get her car covered, every day, with droppings. For another resident, I got her over £2 000 in a compensation payment through pursuing her case. Some of the issues I dealt with, particularly those involving anti-social behaviour, were difficult and sometimes harrowing.\nThe background I brought to my period as a Councillor was that I am a retired civil servant who was, at one time, Chair of the Board of a European Agency (the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, based in Bilbao, Spain) and at another time Chair of the Channel Tunnel Safety Authority. After a long career in public service at a European and national level it was a priviledge and a pleasure to use the skills I had obtained, in the service of my immediate, local community. My wife Gloria and I have lived in our Ward for 26 years and both our daughters went to local State schools. I like Sutton, which has a pleasant suburban atmosphere, low crime, good schools, affordable housing and low unemployment. I have been motivated by a desire to play my part in keeping its many benefits. And the values I bring to being a Councillor are those of a concern to use the skills I have acquired in life to benefit the disadvantaged in society – in society as a whole and, in my work these past four years, in the immediate community around me. And I have still managed to find time to play the trumpet in a Sutton-based concert band, playing last year in a concert at Christchurch for the 125th. anniversary of the church, and playing Christmas carols at the Friends’ Meeting House for the past two years.\nThere has been hardly a day in the last four years when I have not been engaged on some activity on behalf of the residents of Sutton.\nRICHARD CLIFTON",

My first day as Mayor, following my election, involved two contrasting events that I attended with my wife Gloria, the Mayoress. I am told that in the course of my year as Mayor I may well attend over 300 events, and I hope they are all as stimulating as those on day one.\nFirst, I had to cut the ribbon at the start of the “Cloverleaf” cycle ride commencing in the town centre. These evening rides are into their twentieth season and involve a ride of a couple of hours one evening a week during the summer months. A crowd of about thirty cyclists assembled. I was able to tell them that I am a cyclist, owner of a Dawes Galaxy bike, and twice completed the annual London to Brighton bike ride, as well as cycling across France to Chartres ten years ago to visit the cathedral there. Some of the cyclists are collecting sponsorship money so I offered that if they collect sponsorship for the Mayor’s charity appeal, supporting Sutton Shopmobility and the Altzheimer’s Society, I would invite them into the Mayor’s Parlour for a chat and a photo.\nThe second event was at All Saints church, Hackbridge and Beddington Corner, where the Reverend Susan Lynn Billin was licensed as priest-in-charge by the Bishop of Croydon. This was a moving service in a parish that has been without a priest-in-charge for about a year but that clearly has a big and enthusiastic congregation.

The MPs are stepping up the pressure by launching an on-line petition to London NHS boss, Ruth Carnell.\nSt George’s NHS Trust was the only Trust to bid for St Helier. However, St George’s is struggling with a series of financial difficulties and recently has seen the departure of its Chief Executive.

Health professionals and local councillors feel bounced. There is growing alarm at the haste with which this process is moving.\n“The future of St Helier depends crucially on support from clinicians, without that essential goodwill, a merger will become a hostile take-over.

A resident suggested this was about the point where someone walking back from the station with a takeaway snack would finish it and drop rubbish.\nRe-surfacing of Hillcroome Road to deal with potholes after the hard winter of 2009/2010.\nImprovements to the layout of the Brighton Road at the junction with Ventnor Road and Devonshire Avenue, to reduce road accidents.\nImprovements made in relation to signage and road markings outside Overton Grange school due to concerns about road safety when students leave the school at the end of the day. A new, flashing “wig wag” sign (it flashes when switched on at about the time students arrive at or leave school) erected.\nThis is the “wig wag” sign.\nExpansion of Devonshire Avenue, The Avenue and Barrow Hedges primary schools will make it easier for Sutton South parents to get their children into these excellent, popular and frequently over-subscribed schools. We also succeeded in moving the polling stations from Devonshire and Barrow Hedges schools to local church halls, so the education of the children will not be disrupted for a day and related child care problems can be avoided.\nExtension of the “No Drinking Zone” into Sutton South Ward, to deal with issues of anti-social behaviour associated with a group of “all day drinkers” who tend to congregate on the corner of Cedar Road and Brighton road, the location shown in this picture.\nRepresentations made by your local Liberal Democrat Councillors to contribute to Sutton-wide response to Transport for London consultation on the future of the X26 Croydon to Heathrow service, the 80 service from Sutton station to Belmont and the 280 Tooting to Belmont service, to stress the importance to local people of these services.\nSupport for the creation of more “car club” bays in Sutton South Ward, such as this bay in Albion Road which was identified for conversion to a “car club” bay, in order to encourage better car use, reducing pollution, a “greener” Borough and policy on sustainable transport.

And in Copse Hill we also intervened to get Council officials to look at the potential for a flooding problem at the foot of the hill, with the cleaning out of the soakaways and other improvements.\nAction to improve the Devonshire Avenue Nature Area, involving, amongst other things, re-positioning the benches, partially removing a wall that divides up the site, possibly fencing some areas with low wooden fencing to protect the kidney vetch essential for the small blue buterfly, removing the corrugated iron sheeting found at the site and installing a small piece of play equipment for children aged 5 to 7 at the entrance, while taking action to control the habitat. The reserve is the only open space in the Ward. We have supported only limited installation of play equipment as we believe the area should continue to be a nature reserve, and our proposals are designed to ensure the habitat of the area will not be harmed. We are promoting a programme to assist the small blue butterfly.\nAction to improve the safety of pedestrians who pass under the railway bridge in Grange Vale. There is a narrow pavement and, as it is a one-way street, cars roar round the corner from the Brighton Road end and under the bridge, the driver only seeing a pedestrian on the pavement under the bridge at the last moment.

Action to prevent the boxes being covered with unsightly advertising.\nAction to promote the sensitive re-development of Sutherland House, which is currently an eyesore, and to ensure that if it is re-developed there will be gains for the residents of the Ward through a programme of improvements funded by the developer, through the community infrastructure levy and section 106 contributions.\nAction to get the Edwardian tennis pavilion in Mayfield Road included on the Sutton Local List as a building of significant local historical importance and interest.\nCampaign launched to stop Thameslink services being terminated at Blackfriars, something that would lead to dispersion of commuters onto other services that are already packed, cut Sutton off from St. Pancras International and north London, and harm the attractiveness of Sutton to companies locating their offices away from but close to central London.\nA programe of road maintenence throughout the Ward – this picture shows line painting in Eaton Road.\nThe side entrance at Sutton station\nOur campaign continues to get the side entrance to Sutton station opened.

  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_author_richardclifton_page_26/content_849.html": "A survey across Sutton South Ward in the period immediately before the Brighton Road car park closed and immediately after shows that the closure of the Brighton Road car park has not had an impact on parking in the Ward.\nThe results are shown below.\nNow that the decision is reached on the Subsea7 proposal to build their new offices in Sutton, Richard has written to residents setting out his thoughts on the impact locally. He claims that that he and Heather are probably the most successful local Councillors in Britain, as few have been involved in attracting 500 new jobs to their Ward. He writes:\n“When I was elected in 2010 I observed that Sutton South is a generally affluent area but there are pockets of poverty, particularly in the social housing estates in the Ward. Many of these people are people who are at the margins of the labour market, often single mothers or people in their 50s who have been made redundant, unskilled and struggling to find work, people whose lives would be transformed if they could get back into employment. Jobs are gold dust.\nI cannot pretend that the Subsea7 proposal was something I was responsible for. But when it was proposed, I felt that to have a major, successful, expanding engineering company create 500 jobs in my Ward by building a modern, attractive HQ building, replacing a half empty car park, was something positive. So, with Heather, I had a lot of discussions with Subsea7 and we would like to think that we were responsible for many of the improvements made to the plans as they developed.\nThere were three sets of objections put to me by residents.\nFirst, Subsea7 could have gone to one of the other empty office buildings in Sutton. I discussed this with them. They had a number of technical objections, in particular that the size of their work teams meant any conventional 80s or earlier tower block would not be suitable as the teams would be spread over several floors. But it became clear to me that they wanted their own, prestige building, being prepared to spend surprising amounts of money employing a top firm of European architects to design it, and if we could not accept that they would go elsewhere – Epsom or Leatherhead seemed likely. In fact Sutton has suffered a decline in the number of office buildings, as many are converted to residential uses, and it is a bonus to have this new prestige office development.\nSecond, the development would only create jobs for engineers, and not for local people. This is not so. An office complex of this size will create jobs for cleaners, receptionists, clerks, drivers, catering workers etc. The site is surrounded by social housing estates ( Sutton Court , Beauclere House, Westmoreland Drive , Ambleside Gardens ) and local people within walking distance will be well placed to compete for these less skilled jobs. The workforce in this office complex will spend money in local shops and restaurants. The clients will come to these offices from, we are told, all over the world, spending money in local hotels and restaurants. This is the type of upward momentum the area needs.\nThird, it would displace parking into local streets to an unacceptable extent. The current evidence, in the immediate aftermath of closure, is that this has not happened. Heather and I insisted on a substantial discount being offered to drivers to move to Gibson Road , and the deal done by Reed to enable their staff to park in the underused B and Q car park has been significant. For the longer term, we know Network Rail is interested in expanding the station car park. There still is a problem of parking in some roads in the Ward, though the closure of Brighton Road has not affected it.\nFrom my point of view, my term as a Councillor ends next year and I would like to think I am leaving some legacy in the location in our Ward of such a prestige development by an expanding company, creating local jobs. There are very few Councillors in the UK who have got 500 new jobs in their Ward.”\nCAR PARKING SURVEY: SEPTEMBER 2013\nThis survey of the number of parked cars was carried out on a number of dates, between 9.30am and 10.30am, this being late enough for any commuter parking in local roads to be in place.\nThe count covers all roads in Sutton South Ward outside the Controlled Parking Zone, except those with other parking controls in place such as yellow lines preventing commuter parking.\nThe dates were as follows. Results below are in the order of these dates:\n- Thursday 26 September, in the week before the car park closed\n- Monday 30 September, the day before it closed\n- Tuesday 1 October, the first day that it was closed\n- Thursday 3 October, for comparison with the previous Thursday.\nEAST OF BRIGHTON ROAD\nChalgrove Road 18 14 12 17\nDownside Road 28 22 21 24\nFarm Close 3 4 3 3\nFarm Road 3 4 4 4\nKayemoor Road 14 14 12 16\nLangley Park Road (section outside CPZ) 34 30 30 34\nMayfield Road 91 87 90 79\nPrior Avenue 18 16 16 12\nThe Ridgway north of Farm Road junction 59 59 61 53\nThe Ridgway south of Farm Road junction 9 11 12 7\nUpland Road south of Farm Road junction 7 7 4 6\nUpland Road north of Farm Road junction 18 14 16 20\nWillis Avenue 20 18 18 16\nWEST OF BRIGHTON ROAD\nAbbotsleigh Close 11 8 6 8\nAudley Close 29 26 27 29\nCamborne Road (section outside CPZ, east of Overton Road ) 38 41 35 32\nChanctonbury Gardens (outside marked bays for residents) 0 0 0 0\nGrange Road (section outside CPZ, east of Overton Road ) 30 30 30 29\nLeslie Gardens 15 11 14 15\nLyndhurst Way 2 2 2 2\nOverton Road (section south of junction with Grange Road ) 35 31 29 35\nOverton Road (section between junctions with Grange Road and Worcester Road )\n15 15 15 15\nStanley Road (section south of junction with Grange Road ) 21 22 19 21\nStanley Road (section between junctions with Grange Road and Worcester Road )\n19 17 16 19\nSummers Close 7 7 4 7\nTapestry Close (before reaching signs saying residents parking) 5 6 5 5\nTurner Mews 5 5 5 5\nVentnor Road (section outside CPZ) 9 7 7 10\nWestmoreland Drive (outside marked bays for residents) 31 26 34 34\nWorcester Road (section outside CPZ, east of Overton Road ) 20 24 24 21\nAn ugly and half empty car park, or 500 jobs",

This led to the biggest speeding survey ever in our Ward, and to agreement on width restrictions to reduce speeding at two points in Cedar Road and two points in Cavendish Road.\nIn addition we have proposed and obtained funding for additional “20 mph” roundels to be painted on roads within the South Sutton 20mph area. This will enable the Council to put 20 mph “roundels” on the road at the east end of Cavendish Road to match those at the west end. There have always been roundels at the west end, so drivers know it is a 20mph zone they are entering. At the east end there is no roundel as the driver is already in a 20 mph zone and the law said the roundels could only be placed at the entry point to the zone. A recent change in the law means the roundels can now be displayed within the zone to re-enforce the message. We hope to have additional roundels at several points within the 20mph zone to re-enforce the message that you are in such a zone.\nWe are convinced this will help with the speeding problem in Cavendish Road, and elsewhere in the 20mph zone.\nPROMOTING THE SUTTON TRAMLINK\nSutton Council has made public detailed plans for an extension of London Tramlink to the town. The plans were made public at a meeting on Thursday 23 May attended by Councillors, local business leaders and the Under Secretary of State for Transport, Norman Baker MP, who was at the launch event to give the project his backing. .\nThe planned route would run from the existing Tramlink Croydon-Wimbledon line at Merton through Rosehill and St Helier, Angel Hill, and Sutton High Street to a terminal at Sutton station. A later second phase would link the town centre to the Royal Marsden Hospital.\nThe tram connection would cut local journey times and costs, reduce pollution on the streets of Sutton and help regenerate areas such as the St Helier Estate by encouraging investment, improving access and widening the job market in the areas concerned.\nThe extension through our Ward to the Marsden hospital would be of importance as it is expected that the development of a research centre at the Marsden will create many local jobs.\nThe Tramlink is a major plank in the “Opprtunity Sutton” programme, which Richard is closely involved with as vice-chair of the Housing, Economy and Business Committee.\nSUTTON SOUTH LOCAL COMMITTEE DISCUSSES SOCIAL ISOLATION\nThe South Sutton, Cheam and Belmont Local Committee devoted half its meeting on 23 May, held at Christchurch in Christchurch Park, to discussing the “South Sutton Hello!” project and social isolation in the area. There were a number of presentations and themes for discussion, after an introduction by Heather as Chair of the Steering Group.\nHeather reminded us that South Sutton Hello is an initiative to combat loneliness and isolation, supported by major local charities like AgeUK, Citizens’ Advice Bureau, Sutton Mental Health Foundation, and local residents’ Associations such as SSNA and the HRA. It is a non-political initiative with support from all political parties.\nIt was aunched at Christchurch on 9 May by the Care Minister, Norman Lamb MP and is intended to be a pilot for similar initiatives elsewhere. Sutton South Ward chosen as on the basis Campaign to End Social Isolation toolkit, it is a ward where the risk of social isolation is particularly high:\n– the Ward has the highest proportion of over 65’s of any Ward in Sutton\n– the proportion over 85 is double the Sutton and national average\n– there are a large number of people living in sheltered accommodation for the elderly or in single occupancy flats\n– over three quarters of residents live in purpose-built blocks of flats\n– almost half of all households are single person households\n– but a quarter of residents in the Ward say they regularly volunteer in some capacity, so there is a high level of community activism.\nThe project has drawn together a listing of the various community initiatives in Sutton South, particularly those run by the churches and AgeUK. It has produced a first newsletter and will follow this up with more. There are a number of specific activities it has promoted:\n– the Wednesday “Hello Club” at Christchurch run by SCILL (Sutton Centre for Independent Living and Learning)\n– Chair based exercise classes organised by AgeUK for the Sutton and Surrey Senior Citizens Club\n– The “Second Saturday” social club for older people at the Friends’ Meeting House, where attendance has increased five fold since the project started promoting it.\nAgeUK say there has been a 106% increase in callers from our Ward to its Information and Advice service since the project started promoting it. The project is seeking volunteers, particularly as befrienders. These are organised by the Sutton Centre for Independent Living and Learning. There is a phone number 0208 770 4065, or email information@scill.org.uk.\nAt its meeting, following the discussion, the Committee agreed the extension of controlled parking to Eastleigh Close, a project Richard has championed on behalf of the residents there, who have voted for it in successive consultation exercises.\nThe Commmittee also agreed to a proposal Richard made for additional “20mph” roundels in the road in the Sutton South 20mph area, to combat speeding.\nRICHARD AND HEATHER CONTINUE THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES, FOR SOCIAL SERVICES AND ECONOMIC GROWTH\nMay the 20th. was the date Sutton Council held its “annual” Council meeting that elects the new Mayor and allocates Councillors to the various Council Committees. Richard and Heather are both continuing with the responsibilities they have had since last year – Heather as vice-chair of the Adult Social Services and Health Committee, Richard as vice-chair of the Housing, Economy and Business Committee.\nBoth have a variety of other appointments, many related to these main responsibilities. Heather is a member of the South West London Joint Health Scrutiny Committee and the Merton, Sutton and Surrey Joint Health Scrutiny Committee. She is also a member of the committee responsible for appointments of senior officers. Richard continues to chair the Sutton Joint Health and Safety Committee (“joint” with recognised trade unions) and is a member of the Standards Committee, the Scrutiny Committee and the Sutton Town Centre Partnership.\nRICHARD CALLS FOR STRONGER POWERS TO ENFORCE PLANNING DECISIONS\nSutton Council’s Development Control Committee strongly supported an appeal by Richard, at its meeting on 22 May, for stronger powers to be available to planning authorities to enforce planning decisions.\nThe Committee held a general discussion of the planning history of St. Jude’s nursing home in Mayfield Road, triggered by the latest planning application.\nRichard pointed out to the Committee that there had been a succession of structures built in the small garden of the nursing home without the owner bothering to observe the requirements to apply in advance for planning permission. Some were still not in compliance with the planning permission obtained.\nHe argued that the basic problem was that planning law is weak in terms of the tools for enforcement provided to the authority, in contrast to the field he used to work in, health and safety, where enforcement can be direct and immediate. As a result it seems to residents that the developer acts with impunity and nothing is done. Enforcement is a slow process with numerous opportunities for appeals and delay available to the developer.\nHe mentioned to the Committee that, when elected in 2010, he arranged some meetings between the owner and local residents, which seemed to improve the atmosphere locally for a time. He was personally very disappointed that these had not sorted out the problems.\nHowever, the Committee decided, with evident reluctance, that with regard to the particular small modification to an already extended building that was the subject of this particular application before them, there were no sound planning grounds to refuse it.\nBIN COLLECTION ON A WEEKLY BASIS GUARANTEED FOR YEARS TO COME\nSutton householders can rely on having weekly bin collections for the next five years after Sutton Council promised the Government it would continue to maintain the service on this basis.\nThe Leader of the Council has written to the Department for Communities and Local Government pledging the authority to carry on collecting residual waste on a weekly basis weekly through to 2016/17.\nThe move follows a successful bid for £2.8million of funding from the Waste Collection Support Scheme.\nRichard and Heather have been concerned to ensure a weekly pattern of collection is maintained and are delighted that this commitment has been given.\nWeekly bin collections are very important to residents and we have worked very hard to ensure that we continue providing that service.\nIn spring last year we made radical changes to our collection system in order to make the service more adaptable and cost-efficient and we will continue focusing on providing a high-quality, value-for-money service.\nIn addition to weekly collections, the authority is also committed to continuing crucial work on promoting more recycling and cutting the volume of waste sent to landfill.\nThe decision to retain weekly collections has been agreed, but it will be formally ratified by Sutton Council’s Environment and Neighbourhoods Committee.\nSt. HELIER BATTLE MOVES TO NEW LEVEL\nOn 9 May local GPs and other clinicians met to discuss the future of St Helier Hospital and the proposals put forward by the Better Service Better Value (BSBV) review. Very disappointingly, the Sutton Clinical Commissioning Group has agreed to consult on the three proposals recommended by the BSBV review.\nThis is despite the clear opposition to these proposals that local campaigners and presented to the meeting.\nThe decision means that St Helier is at risk of becoming a “local hospital”, losing its A&E and maternity units and Epsom is also potentially losing its frontline services, becoming a centre for elective care.\nThe second option, but less preferred by BSBV, is Epsom becoming the local hospital with St Helier becoming the centre for elective care. The third option is St Helier continuing as an acute hospital with Epsom becoming the centre for elective care and Croydon University Hospital becoming the most downgraded.\nBut this is not a done deal.\nThese recommendations still need to be approved by the other Clinical Commissioning Groups in South West London before they will be subject to a public consultation.\nWe will continue to fight tooth and nail for the future of our local hospital, working with other local campaigners to plan how we can make sure the voice of the local community is heard.\nWe will be taking our campaign to the next level to ensure that NHS bosses can be in no doubt – we want to Save Our St Helier!\nLAUNCH OF “SUTTON SOUTH HELLO!”\nSUTTON SOUTH HELLO!\n“Sutton South Hello!” was formally launched on Thursday 9th May at Christ Church, Christchurch Park, by Care Minister Norman Lamb MP.\nThis important local project, Sutton South Hello!, aims to encourage us all to be better neighbours and support older people stay active and in touch with their local community, and to offer us the benefit of their experience and expertise.\nNorman Lamb MP, Care and Support Minister, agreed to launch the project, and our MP Paul Burstow, Heather and Richard were also there. Heather, as chair of the steering group, introduced the Minister.\nThe project is about us all remembering to say, “Hello”, more often, to offer help when it is needed and to know where to go when there are problems.\nWe have produced a first newsletter which sets out clearly what events are going on locally, such as where to go for a chat and a cup of tea. Each Wednesday afternoon, the Wednesday Hello! Club meets at Christ Church Community Hall for tea and coffee, activities and informal advice if someone has a worry or a problem.\nThere is one telephone number, 020 8770 4065 manned by SCILL (Sutton Centre for Independent Living and Learning), that people can phone if they, or someone they know, needs support because they are lonely or isolated. They can be put in touch with someone who can offer them befriending or more professional help if that is needed. We are also looking for volunteers to help with the project, all skills welcome, and the contact telephone number is the same.\nThe Safer Neighbourhoods police team were at the launch, as well as the mobile library service , AgeUK, other voluntary organisations, and Heather and Richard. There was plenty of tea and cake.\nThe Hello! project will also feature at the Sutton South, Cheam and Belmont Local Committee on 23 May at the same venue. Residents are invited for refreshments at 6pm before a discussion of the scheme at 6.30pm.”\nSUTHERLAND HOUSE PROPOSAL “THE UNACCEPTABLE FACE OF CAPITALISM”\nTonight, the Council’s Development Control Committee supported the call by Richard and Heather – who both spoke to the meeting – to oppose the current planning application for Sutherland House as it contains no provision for affordable housing. They both deplored the fact that the building has been empty and derelict for years, but said this should not drive us to accept a thoroughly objectionable proposal.\nRichard quoted the phrase coined by a Conservative Prime Minister of the 1970’s, Edward Heath, no militant socialist, that a particular set of actions he dealt with was “the unacceptable face of capitalism.” He said “What the Committee has before it tonight is exactly that. It is a project that puts profit before people.”\nThe proposal of the developers is to take an existing large building which, for reasons still obscure, has been empty and derelict for years, and renovate it so there are 160 luxury, private, residential apartments. These will in due course be available to be sold or rented for sums of money most of us would find astonishing, but because Sutton remains a thriving area despite the recession (due to the good management of its affairs by its Council) there will be no shortage of demand.\nBut the developer claims that the whole project is so financially marginal that they cannot possibly include any affordable housing atall. This seems unlikely, and the Council’s independent study suggests there is £1.91 million of profit in the proposal over and above what one would regard as a normal and acceptable margin. Some affordable housing can be included without the project becoming unviable.\nHeather and Richard deal with a lot of casework concerning housing in our Ward. They come across many families, often families with small children, that live in desperately overcrowded conditions. There is a massive need for affordable housing in the Britain of 2013. It is a national problem, it is a problem here in Sutton, and it is a problem in a seemingly affluent area like Sutton South Ward.\nRichard said “I do not know why the developer has kept the site empty for so long, as, I am told, it did with the Root and Brown tower in Merton. I deplore the fact that it is an empty and derelict eyesore, a blot on the landscape. Perhaps the expectation was that eventually we would be so fed up with it we would accept anything to get it developed. I am almost at the stage where I would accept anything to get it developed and am at the stage where I would accept almost anything. But not this scheme.”\nThe Committee agreed to support the proposals of the officers to oppose this proposal at the forthcoming hearing by the Planning Inspectorate and seek some affordable housing provision.",

The nature area is the only open space in our Ward, in an area where many children live in flats without access to a garden. As it is the only open space in our Ward it is precious to us. It is a nature area so requires careful management. To join the Friends group email the Sutton Council officer leading the work, Dawn Fielding\ndawn.fielding@sutton.gov.uk\nWe have secured funding for improvements to the nature area – to the signage and the seating and to clean off the graffiti. On 18 October last year the three Councillors met with several Council officers from the Parks Department at the Nature Area to discuss improvements to the area, and we subsequently took proposals to the local committee to obtain funding for improvement work. On 23 January we met with the volunteers from Sutton Nature Conservation Volunteers who were engaged in necessary maintenance activities at the site. There is discussion about how to best use the area, protect biodiversity (such as the rare “ivy broomrape” which is found in the nature area) while keeping it well used by residents, reduce litter and graffiti, and whether it should be locked at night. Please contact us with your views and to join the Friends group.\nWhile the Nature Reserve is the only open space in our Ward two parks are adjacent – Warren Park at the north eastern boundary of the Ward and Overton Park at the south western boundary. There are also steps being taken to establish Friends groups for these parks, in particular Warren Park.

Richard lives round the corner from Farm Road and vehicles certainly speed down it. This complements other measures in the Ward to reduce speeding, in particular in Cavendish Road and Cedar Road.\nWe also agreed to install a width restriction at the point in Grange Vale where the road passes under the bridge. The speed of vehicles has a safety implication for pedestrians walking west to east on the narrow pathway, particularly if pushing a buggy. We also agreed to plant a replacement for the vandalised tree in Willis Avenue. The committee also agreed Richard’s proposal to purchase from the Royal British Legion a “Silent Soldier” and install it in the flower beds in front of Northumberland House. These are large silhouettes of soldiers, designed to be installed through 2018 in prominent places to remind us that this is the centenary of the conclusion of the Great War.\nWe hope the parking consultation will now take place much earlier than anticipated.",
  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_category_environment_page_11/content_159.html": "A street meeting attended by local residents was held on the morning of 9 June at the box, pictured above, erected by BT/Openreach outside 39 Cedar Road in South Sutton Ward. While we need these boxes for Broadband, local people have expressed strong feelings about the way this box is erected right outside the resident’s front window.\nA post on this website (see archive for May 2011) describes the general problem related to these boxes, but we are aware that BT/Openreach can, due to an Act of Parliament, ignore planning law in erecting the boxes. Sutton Council wrote to them last November with objections to the proposal to erect this box in Cedar Road as it contravenes Department for Transport guidance. BT seemingly ignored the Council’s objection, which they can legally do, though they have maintained that in a discussion with a member of staff of the Council the objection was later withdrawn. These objections related only to comformity with planning guidance and not the wider problem of the impact of the box on the amenity of local residents. Within a 100 yard radius of the box there are four old-style green boxes in appropriate positions that do not cause any problem to residents. Local residents felt that the box could have been erected alongside one of those.\nThe street meeting was attended by local residents, including the occupant of 39 Cedar Road, Councillor Clifton and Councillor Colin Hall, who deals with these issues on the Executive of Sutton Council and has been in touch with other Councils that have similar problems across London. Jack Hamilton, former chair of Sutton South Neighbourhood Association and a local resident, also attended.\nTwo people from BT/Openreach, Giles Ellerton and Adrian Paice, came to the meeting. The argument they put to the local residents was an entirely technical argument that technical problems, related to avoiding digging up pavements where there are high-voltage cables and required distances between cabinets, prevented them from putting the cabinet in any other position.\nLocal residents were suspicious of the argument put, in that it is a technical argument by the people who have the technical expertise, and consequently no-one present had the expertise necessary to assess its validity. There was also a feeling that if the occupant had had hard standing for a car in front of her house, as the house next door does, this would have prevented BT/Openreach from erecting a cabinet in that position – in which case they would undoubtedly have found some other solution, not just given up.\nIn email exchanges after the meeting an offer has been made to the resident of 39 Cedar Road of compensation for particular aspects of the inconvenience she has suffered. However this is very limited and we understand she is not likely to accept it.\nCouncillor Clifton, whose pressure led to the meeting being set up, comments as follows:\n“This meeting has not resolved the problem. I can take some positives from it.\nFirst, BT/Openreach have, under pressure, now met local residents and explained in much greater detail than we have had before why the box was erected where it is. This makes it possible to seek more information and a technical opinion on whether their argument stands up, something we will do.\nSecond, alerted by the problem here, I will ask Sutton Council officials to advise me as a local Councillor of the locations of any further boxes to be erected in Sutton South Ward so I can look at the proposed locations. BT/Openreach seem to have been usually quite responsible in assessing locations, which makes it particularly disappointing that they cannot resolve the Cedar Road problem – a particular, and severe, problem.\nFinally, the meeting has led to a very limited offer of compensation. That is, however, a matter for those involved to discuss.”\n[ A tense moment during the road meeting, at which there was a frank and open exchange of views between local residents and BT/Openreach staff. Councillor Clifton, on the right, puts a point to Giles Ellerton of BT/Openreach. ]",

The full text can be found at the end of this post.\nTo put in your submission email it to teamp2@pins.gsi.gov.uk for the attention of Peter Lyne, Case Officer, quoting Planning Inspectorate reference APP/P5870/A/12/2184339/NWF.\nWe object to the proposal on the grounds that it is overdevelopment of the site, with 50 dwellings crammed in. It is the type of low-quality accommodation that we continue to oppose in our Ward, where there are instances of the Planning Inspectorate overturning local decisions and allowing substantial family houses to be demolished to make way for blocks of small flats without gardens. There are current examples in Eaton Road and Albion Road, sites where building work is currently underway, the proposals rejected by Sutton Council but allowed by the Planning Inspectorate. Half the children in our Ward live in accommodation without access to a garden. There is a shortage of affordable family homes.\nIn addition, the provision for car parking (33 car parking spaces for 50 dwellings) is inadequate and will lead to great pressure on parking, with additional demand for parking in the area.\nOur reasons are, unsurprisingly, almost identical with the reasons given by the Council for rejecting the application.\nOur submission objecting to the proposal was included in the papers that went to the Council’s Development Control Committee on 5 September, and Richard attended the Committee meeting, though he was not called to be a member of the panel of Councillors reaching a decision that evening.\nHERE IS THE FULL TEXT OF OUR SUBMISSION\nFor the attention of Peter Lyne, Case Officer\nPostal Address:\nPeter Lyne\nThe Planning Inspectorate\n3/10 Wing\nTemple Quay House\n2 The Square\nBristol.\nBS1 6PN\nAppeal relating to 54 – 58 Overton Road, Sutton, Surrey, SM2 6RB\nLondon Borough of Sutton Reference B2012/66079/FUL\nPlanning Inspectorate reference APP/P5870/A/12/2184339/NWF\nSUBMISSION\nWe understand this appeal is being determined by written procedure.\nWe would like to comment on this appeal, and ask that our comments are considered by the Inspector.\nWe are elected Councillors for Sutton South Ward in the London Borough of Sutton.\nAlthough the development is not in Sutton South Ward, it is very close to the Ward.

Half the children at the one primary school in our Ward live in accommodation without access to a garden. There are a lot of small flats but a shortage of affordable family homes. Couples who live in the flats in the Ward often find that when they have children, and the flat is too small, they cannot find a home they can afford in the area so have to move away.\nSecond, the provision for car parking (33 car parking spaces for 50 dwellings) is inadequate and will lead to great pressure on parking, with additional demand for parking in an area that is already fully parked up much of the time.\nOur reasons are almost identical with the reasons given by the Council for rejecting the application.\nWe note that there is to be a site visit.

Please see the press release below.”\nCllr Heather Honour\nSt George’s decide not to proceed with merger process\nSt George’s Healthcare NHS Trust have informed us and our strategic authority, NHS London, that they cannot proceed with their bid to merge with St Helier and Sutton hospitals.\nThroughout the process St George’s have been very positive about the strategic opportunity to merge and the benefits this could bring to patients.\nHowever, due to the financial challenges facing hospitals in south west London and the inability to pre-empt the outcome of the Better Services Better Value review, which is looking at how NHS services are provided across south west London, they do not feel able to proceed at this time.\nThis is because the review, which will be open to public consultation, could have a significant impact on the financial income of all hospitals involved.\nSt George’s have however expressed a full commitment to working closely with St Helier and Sutton hospitals in the future.\nJan Sawkins is the Independent Chair of the special Board set up to help St Helier, Sutton and Epsom hospitals to achieve foundation trust status. She said: “Whilst we have always been aware that a bidder could withdraw during the process, at this stage in the transaction it is obviously very disappointing news.\n“The Transaction Board has a meeting scheduled next week (7 February 2012) and we will use this to consider the options and agree a way forward. This may include re-opening tenders for St Helier and Sutton hospitals.”\nMatthew Hopkins, Trust Chief Executive said: “This is disappointing news, but St George’s have been clear to us that their decision is not based on our staff, nor the quality of the services we provide at St Helier and Sutton hospitals.\n“As you would expect, the Trust Board and those working on the transaction have been looking at other options in case this happened and we look forward to discussing these with the Transaction Board next week.\n“Whilst we are making decisions about the long-term future of our hospitals, our priority will – as ever – continue to be ensuring our patients and local people receive the very best services.”\nAsked what this means for Epsom Hospital, Jan added: “It is the current belief that, subject to Ashford and St Peter’s Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust being confirmed as the Preferred Partner for Epsom Hospital, the de-merger could continue whilst we make alternative arrangements for St Helier and Sutton.\n“Whilst this would, of course, need further investigation and approval by the Transaction Board, the Trust Board and others, it is felt that this would be in the best interest of Epsom Hospital, its patients, staff and local people.\n“However, I would emphasise that the priority remains to secure the future of Epsom, St Helier and Sutton hospitals.”\nFor more information about the work of the Trust visit our website: www.epsom-sthelier.nhs.uk. You can also follow us on Twitter (twitter.com/epsom_sthelier) or find us on Facebook (facebook.com/epsomsthelier).\nThis is what St Georges said in their press release:\nSt George’s media statement\nSt George’s Healthcare NHS Trust submitted a bid for a potential merger with St Helier Hospital in November 2011.\nThe board is clear that a merger between St George’s Healthcare and St Helier would be an excellent strategic opportunity, with the potential to bring significant improvements to the care of patients across southwest London and beyond.\nAfter careful consideration the board has reached the conclusion that the current terms of the merger prevent us from proceeding further at this time.\nThe level of financial challenge facing hospitals in south west London, combined with the inability to pre-empt the outcome of a public consultation around the Better Services Better Value (BSBV) review, means this is not the right time for us to progress with the transaction.\nWe want to continue to build on the existing links that are in place for clinical services. We have identified a number of the potential benefits to patients that would occur from an acquisition which could also be delivered if the organisations remained separate legal entities which we shall continue to pursue.\nWe are particularly keen to develop the clinical and academic networks that span St George’s Healthcare and St Helier, and explore opportunities to establish new networks across services, to the benefit of patients.\nA key priority for the trust is to achieve Foundation Trust (FT) status by 2014, and we will focus our efforts on achieving this. The board feels strongly that achieving FT status will strengthen the opportunities for St. George’s Healthcare and St Helier to work together in the future.\nThis is what Ashford and St Peters have had to say:\nStatement re Epsom Hospital\nChief Executive at Ashford and St Peter’s Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Andrew Liles, said:\n“The decision made by St George’s Healthcare NHS Trust not to pursue their bid for St Helier and Sutton hospitals has not changed our position regarding Epsom and we will continue to progress our plans to acquire Epsom hospital (through merger) in line with the process set out by the Transaction Board. Of course this is still subject to approval by the Transaction Board, Epsom and St Helier, the local health authorities and others and by our own Board, who will need to be assured that any final decision is in the best interests of both the Epsom and Ashford and St Peter’s catchment populations.\nAs a Foundation Trust already we feel we are in a strong position strategically to pursue these plans and we know they have already passed through the first stage of the process successfully, meeting the criteria set by local people, stakeholders and staff. These include new and innovative partnerships – with The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, Central Surrey Health and Surrey and Sussex Partnership NHS Trust – to create an integrated healthcare campus at Epsom Hospital, bringing additional services and added benefits to local patients and staff. Our plans are also made more straightforward by the fact that Epsom hospital is not part of the Better Services Better Value review in South West London.\nWe have also had positive initial discussions regarding financial and commissioning support for our plans, although of course final decisions regarding the preferred provider and agreement of financial support are still to be made.”\nFor more information please call the Press Office on: 01932 722163",
  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_author_richardclifton_page_5/content_438.html": "We have a manifesto commitment to plant more trees, to improve air quality, combat global warming and promote the green, suburban feel of Sutton. We will be planting new trees in the next few months in Downside Road, Upland Road, Willis Avenue and Prior Avenue.\nWe were delighted when, in accordance with the commitment to plant more trees to combat global warming, two new trees were planted in early 2021 in The Ridgway. The story concerning the tree outside number 23 is interesting. Many years ago there was a tree pit here and a tree. The tree died. Contractors tarmaced over the tree pit. The tarmac would periodically sag. Richard suggested restoring the tree pit and planting a tree. This was done. The photo was taken during the brief fall of snow on 24 January 2021.\nAt the meeting of Sutton Council on 17 January, chaired by Trish as our Mayor, Richard moved a motion drawing attention to the number of residents of the Ward living in poverty, the support they got from Sutton Council, and the need for Government to properly fund Councils, while increasing spending on welfare to help the poorest. This is the text of his speech:\n“This motion is about poverty and the impact the pandemic has had in exacerbating the gap between the wealthy and the poor in what was already a very unequal society.\nIn current political debate the phrase “Levelling Up” is sometimes used, but in a vague and unspecific manner. I have always seen “levelling up” as a key political aim, but what I mean by this is the need to level up to help those in poverty. It is a preoccupation that is one of the reasons I have always wanted to play a part in public service and political life. I am a Councillor for Sutton South Ward, one of the more affluent Wards in a borough that is more affluent than most of the 32 London boroughs. But in knocking on the doors of my residents I sometimes find people living in shocking poverty, families crowded into small flats, well down the queue for social housing despite their crowded living circumstances, using food banks, often struggling to put food on the table, sometimes out of work due to long term illness but often in these circumstances despite working long hours in low paid jobs. The statistics are frightening – in a borough with a population of about 200 000 over 18 000 of our residents are in such poverty that they are relying on Universal Credit to feed themselves and make ends meet, while over 800 of our families are homeless and living temporarily in nightly-paid accommodation, often far from Sutton with all the problems of getting their children to school here.\nWho is helping these families? Not the Government, and the low point was reached on the sixth of October of last year when, on the very day that the Government cut £20 a week from the welfare support to the poorest in society, making us one of the European countries that gives least help to the poorest in society from welfare, Boris Johnson made his famous closing speech to the Tory party conference which even one Conservative newspaper described as being like an after dinner speech full of jokey one-liners rather than a serious speech, talking in serious terms, about serious problems, given by a serious politician. We are still waiting for such a speech. I doubt if we will ever get it. And I think that even the Tories now doubt we ever get it. And in recent months it has become evident that the public at large have clearly recognised we will never get it.\nThe Resolution Foundation estimated that despite the minimum wage rise and other Government tinkering, the lowest paid fifth of households will lose £280 in support this financial year – and that was before the rise in National Insurance contributions was announced, and before the coming tidal wave of inflationary pressures became clear. This is a massive sum for those whose budgets are so stretched. Not a lot of “Levelling Up” here.\nBy contrast, what does local Government do? Despite the £36 million annual cut from our budget by central Government since 2010 Sutton Council continues to give priority to services that help the poorest, in accordance with our Liberal Democrat principles. We are one of a minority of Councils keeping Meals on Wheels going. We fund Admiral nurses to help families struggling with illness and dementia. We maintain a system of crisis loans and grants for those in greatest need, though central Government support for this was cut back years ago. We support families whose children are eligible for Free School Meals due to the financial position of the family, children who might otherwise go hungry over holiday periods. We can hold our heads high.\nWe have stuck to our principles and to these policies while maintaining our concern for financial responsibility – and despite the savings and cuts to services we have had to make over the years to balance the books as Government support has been cut. The pandemic has added a further layer of financial difficulty with demands for community support that the Council has responded to magnificently, but that have been expensive.\nWhat this motion says is:\nThe pandemic has left many families struggling to survive financially\nThe actions of Government have not helped them\nWe are the key driver locally to spearhead the recovery of the community and help those in most need\nWe need to be funded properly and the welfare support to those of our residents who are the poorest in society needs to be restored.”\nMany of our residents use Warren Park, and the footpath between the railway lines has a real rural feel about it. A small area of Warren Park is protected by a wooden picket fence, to prevent the area being trampled. This is an area of chalk grassland, an important area for biodiversity which encourages some unusual plants and butterflies. Earlier in the year the fence was extensively vandalised and the area damaged by trampling (and dog poo). There was discussion, which we were involved in, about whether the fence should be repaired, replaced by sturdier fencing that would be more effective but unsightly, or removed, with the biodiversity area abandoned. Eventually it was repaired but within a few days it had been extensively vandalised again. It has now been repaired yet again and notices put on the fencing to try to explain the importance of the area and to appeal to the vandals to leave it alone. We are not sure what the impact is likely to be but hope for the best.\nOn Friday 15 October Richard joined residents of Sutton Court and Beauclere House (in Brighton Road) on a “walkabout” of the estate to look at issues the residents wanted to raise. The party was joined by Sutton Housing Partnership (SHP) staff, including the estate manager and the Chief Executive of SHP. SHP manage the housing stock originally owned by the Council as social housing, but about half of the properties in Sutton Court have been purchased by residents under the “Right To Buy” provisions so are now rented out in the private sector rather than being social housing. The residents raised a variety of issues including surfaces that needed re-painting, guttering, garage roofs, faulty lights and notice boards that needed attention.\nSeveral residents of Copse Hill and Dunsfold Court have put to us the point that the parking bay reserved for motorcyclists outside Dunsfold Court is rarely used by motorcyclists, and that those with a motorcycle do not usually have difficulty finding somewhere off the road to park.\nConsequently we have explored the suggestion that this be restored as a parking place for other vehicles, alongside the adjacent parking places, and this change will go ahead unless there is significant local objection. Please let us know if you have views on this.\nWe are aware of pressures on parking spaces in the area, which is one of the reasons we opposed the proposal for a new tower block with relatively few parking spaces at 2 Copse Hill. This proposal, twice turned down by the Council, is again with the Planning Inspectorate in Bristol as an appeal.\nWe are also aware of a proposal for a further block of flats opposite, on the other side of Brighton Road, which was also deficient in terms of the number of parking spaces. This proposal is not yet the subject of a planning application and we are concerned about policies set out in the recent Government White Paper on planning that would, in some areas, lead to automatic consent to planning applications without a process of neighbourhood consultation. We will keep residents advised of progress.\nTransport for London (TfL) have been consulting on changes to local bus routes, including the S1, S3, S4, 80 and 407, and have now reached decisions.\nTheir original proposals and the report on the outcome of consultation can be found on the Transport for London’s website: tfl.gov.uk/sutton-croydon-bus-changes\nThe outcome means that there is little change to the situation in our Ward.\nThe main outcome is that changes to the S3 bus that might have affected our area have not been pursued, which means the S3 will still serve Cedar Road and Langley Park Road. Changes to the S4 route that affected our area are not implemented and it will still run to Overton Grange school and along Grange Road. We are pleased with this outcome, which means there will not be any detriment to services in our Ward, and points we put into the letter of representation sent by Sutton Council have been acted on.\nOn the day England qualified for the final of the European football championship, 7 July, Richard attended a meeting of Sutton Council’s Planning Committee, where we approved the proposals of Sutton United for a new stand, floodlights and a grass pitch, following their promotion to the English football league. Well done Sutton! Richard made a speech recollecting that in 2017 the club had, for the first time ever, reached the fifth round of the FA Cup, playing Arsenal at home. He was Mayor of Sutton at that time and attended the match. The facilities at the ground need upgrading, so he was delighted with these proposals for renovation. This puts Sutton on the map. Now that Barnet have dropped out of the football league, Sutton is the only one of the 32 London boroughs that people will regularly hear of, as a borough with a football league club that has the same name.\nEvery year Sutton Council holds what is referred to as its “Annual Council Meeting” where it elects the Mayor and appoints Councillors to committees. This year it was held on 4 May and held by videoconference. Trish was re-elected Mayor. Richard was relieved of membership of the Audit and Governance Committee but appointed to the Housing, Economy and Business Committee, the Planning Committee, the Greater London Employment Forum (where he is the Leader of the Liberal Democrat Delegation) and the Council and Employees Joint Committee, which he chairs. He will be busy!\nWe are going to refurbish the small piece of play equipment in the Devonshire Avenue Nature Area, which has become very tatty over the ten years since it was installed. Here is Richard’s grandson, Ciaran, enjoying playing on the installation. You can see how tatty it has become.\nThe refurbishment of the play area will see the removal and recycling of this damaged timber play equipment, comprising of over two hundred sleepers in various sizes. It will see the installation of new sleepers, wooden kickboards and “play bark safety surfacing” surrounding the play area. This will encourage children to stay active and provide an invaluable communal focal point in keeping with the natural materials of the Devonshire Avenue Nature Area.\nThe “memorial” bench that has been placed in the nature area, incorporating commemorative images remembering those who died in war, is a moving addition to the area. Here is Trish at the new bench.\nThe nature area is the only open space in our Ward and, particularly as many families live in flats with no access to a garden for children to play in, the nature area is an important amenity. The nature area has, during lockdown, like most parkland, been much more extensively visited than is normal. This has led to some erosion of its value as a nature area. We would greatly welcome the ideas of residents for improving it.\nWhile the Devonshire Avenue Nature Area is the only open space in our Ward, our residents make good use of Overton Park at the western end of the Ward and Warren Park at the eastern end. On 30 April Richard met with Council officers and other Councillors in Warren Park to discuss the vandalisation of the picket fence protecting the nature area in the park. We are anxious to preserve this chalk grassland nature site, which at certain times of year has a wonderful show of cowslips, ox-eye daisies and other wild plants, which will be lost if the area is trampled. Again, we would welcome views on how Warren Park might be improved.\nDealing with parking problems and speeding vehicles has always been a problem. The Council has now concluded, for our Ward, the long-running consultation on parking and has introduced new measures on speeding. While the Council has, on legal advice, amended or withdrawn the six month trial low traffic neighbourhood schemes funded by Transport for London, we have studied resident reaction to these trial schemes and retained the aspects that were popular.\nWe have retained the 20 miles per hour speed limit area in the east of the Ward that was originally introduced as part of these schemes. Consultation with residents showed this was popular and we are discussing action to achieve more enforcement of the limits. The speed limit area covers Mayfield Road and the roads in the Ward to the east of it. This is the area where, following lengthy consultation, a new parking control area was introduced last November. This has cleared parking from these roads which has encouraged speeding, thus justifying the new controls on speeding. The Council’s consultation exercise on parking reached a successful conclusion last year with the Sutton South Permit Parking Area now introduced. An earlier proposal was thrown out by residents but this proposal achieved majority support, generally by overwhelming majorities, in the roads consulted. We regard this as evidence of the success of the approach of the Council, with successive rounds of careful consultation. The parking permit area will be subject to a review this summer. Do contact us if there are aspects of the scheme you want reviewed.",

A panel assesses the proposals (this part based on the TV “Dragons’ Den” concept) and can award up to £80 to the team for them to undertake the project. Richard was one of the “Dragons”, forming a panel with Croydon MP Gavin Barwell and the HR Director of the Fairfield Halls.\nThe event took place at St. Andrew’s secondary school, at Warrington Road in Croydon.\nRichard says “The ideas put forward by these teams were so imaginative. Their projects were all socially useful, though not always entirely practical. But the enthusiasm was massive and the careful presentation of the projects, all of them based on research the teams had carried out, was impressive. One involved inviting people to paint on massive boards, to combat graffiti but also to produce an artwork. Another promoted a national “telling jokes” day, to cheer us all up, and another promoted strategies to get people on the Croydon tram to talk to each other, as they did during the Olympics.”\nAll the teams were awarded the funds they sought. This was not a “play” exercise – the teams will get the funding and take their ideas to completion.",
  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_2022_01_21_concern-over-planning-application-in-copse-hill/content_163.html": "There are two proposals for tower blocks in Brighton Road, almost opposite each other, submitted by developers, that Trish and Richard are fighting. One is on the eastern side of the road close to Cavendish Road. This proposal for a five storey block with 36 flats but only four parking spaces has been rejected by Sutton Council planning officers on a number of grounds including design. Richard said of both proposals:\n“While we need more accommodation these blocks, with little adjacent green space, are of poor design and would be blots on the landscape.”\nThe other proposal is almost opposite at the junction with Copse Hill. Developers have twice submitted proposals for this new tower block at the corner of Copse Hill, to be built after demolishing 2 and 4 Copse Hill, plus 52 and 54 Brighton Road. While housing is needed, we have also opposed this development as – unlike Dunsfold Court and Leith Towers nearby – it would have little green space around the site, and the parking provision proposed was inadequate, adding to parking pressures in the area. The block would be ugly, overbearing and a blot on the landscape.\nThese proposals were rejected by Sutton Council and the developers appealed to the remote Planning Inspectorate in Bristol, thus seeking to overturn democratic local decision taking. We are delighted that the Inspectorate has twice thrown out the proposals. They cite concerns over the overbearing character and appearance of the proposed block, a lack of outdoor amenity space (play areas and garden) and the mix of housing proposed (the number of small one bedroom flats). The Inspectorate rejected concerns about flooding and did not comment on our concerns over parking.\nThis may not be the end of the story so we will watch out for further proposals. Radical changes to planning arrangements were proposed in the recent White Paper on planning from the Conservative Government, proposals that in some areas would abolish these arrangements for comment on planning applications and lead to proposals being automatically agreed. Pressure from the Liberal Democrats, and our victory in the Chesham and Amersham by-election, where planning changes was an issue, seems to be forcing a re-think, but these proposals are still, as of now, Government policy. These Government proposals would remove the right of local residents to comment on planning applications, in some circumstances. Richard made a speech at Sutton Council on 12 July attacking these proposals, which undermine local democracy.",

The petiton called on the Department to put a stop to these proposals.\nSeptember 15 is the deadline to comment on the Department for Transport’s consultation document making this proposal, following a decision by the DfT to extend the consultation period. The link to their consultation document is\nHERE. You can email comments to\nThameslink@dft.gsi.gov.uk\nBelow is our own submission.\nResponse to the Department for Transport Combined Thameslink Franchise Consultation\nFrom Councillor Richard Clifton and Councillor Heather Honour, Liberal Democrat Councillors for Sutton South, London Borough of Sutton\n1. We are the elected Liberal Democrat Councillors for Sutton South Ward, which is just south of Sutton railway station. Passengers leaving Sutton station to the south, by the side entrance (when it is open), pass into Sutton South Ward as they leave the station.\n2. Our Ward is almost entirely residential and a significant number of our residents commute daily into central London for work. Many of these commuters use trains on the Thameslink Loop Line to travel to stations north of Blackfriars, including Farringdon and St. Pancras. Residents of the Ward also tell us they consider they benefit greatly from having a direct service to St. Pancras International, for Continental Europe, and Luton airport.\n3. For that reason we are concerned at the proposal, first set out in the London and South East Route Utilisation Strategy (July 2011), that all Sutton / Wimbledon Thameslink Loop Line trains will terminate at London Blackfriars from 2018.\n4. Terminating Wimbledon Loop services at Blackfriars would result in our residents losing their cross-London service. This will penalise those of our residents who have made their residential, employment and educational location decisions on the basis of the existence of the cross-London Thameslink service. These residents, who chose to live in Sutton South on the basis of an existing pattern of transport connections, would lose a service that they have had for many years, and based their life around.\n5. Any decision should take account of the impact of changes on the travel patterns of existing passengers, and of consequent requirements to change established travel patterns. It is because of the impact on our residents that we object to any proposal that would result in terminating Wimbledon loop trains at Blackfriars.\n6. Not only would our residents lose a through service they have come to depend on, they would lose their connection with Eurostar and domestic long distance trains at St. Pancras International and Kings Cross. Instead they would have to change trains at Blackfriars, carrying possibly heavy luggage onto already crowded trains. This movement could be particularly difficult from the western bay platform when travelling north and to either bay platform when travelling south because of the platform lengths and the position of lifts and stairs at each end of the platforms. The recent Passenger Focus passenger survey found that having to change trains was a strong disincentive to train travel.\n7. Sutton is identified in the London Plan as one of only four Metropolitan town centres in south London , with a large and growing population and employment base. It is a major business centre with many commuters and business travellers. It is therefore essential that Sutton, as a strategic south London destination, retains its connections to central and north London and beyond, and maintains its direct link to St. Pancras and the City.\n8. We also believe that the attractiveness of Sutton to employers considering re-location away from expensive offices in central London would be affected. Sutton is a location from which one can travel to Brussels with just two train journeys, one taking 45 minutes and one two hours, and the journey to Paris is only fifteen minutes longer. We have been successful in attracting businesses to Sutton and this change would have a negative impact, particularly given the expected mushrooming of international train travel from St. Pancras over the next few years. These negative effects would impact on the residents of our Ward who want to work locally in Sutton.\n9. We thus strongly object to any proposal that would result in terminating Wimbledon loop trains at Blackfriars from 2018.\n10. We are aware that Sutton Council is submitting comments, and support those comments. However, we are making this submission to draw particular attention to the impact on our residents in Sutton South Ward.\nRICHARD CLIFTON\nHEATHER HONOUR\nLiberal Democrat Councillors for Sutton South, London Borough of Sutton",
  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_2011_11_11_new-polling-arrangements-will-help-local-schools/content_464.html": "We have supported, and been instrumental in extending, proposals that will reduce disruption at local schools every time there is an election.\nSutton Council recently completed a review of polling areas and polling stations, something it is required by law to conduct at set intervals.\nWe have long been aware of a concern on the part of parents of children at Devonshire Avenue primary school, the school that most primary-age school children in our Ward attend, of the disruptive effect of closing the school for a day to use it as a polling station. It disrupts the education of the children and creates a child-care issue for many parents, particularly those who work and may need to take a day off work as the school is closed. Consequently we have supported the proposal to consider, as an alternative, the use of the hall of Christchurch church in Christchurch Park. We are pleased that this proposal is now likely to be agreed.\nDuring this consultation exercise Richard was approached by parents who live in Sutton South Ward but who send their children to Barrow Hedges school, which is just outside the Ward, making the point that similar considerations (the disruptive effect to the education of the children and the impact on parents) apply in respect of Barrow Hedges school. This led Richard to promote considering the use of the Baptist church hall in Banstead Road as an alternative. At the meeting of Sutton Council on 5 December the proposal will be put to it that in future neither Devonshire Avenue school nor Barrow Hedges school be used as polling stations. We support these proposals as they will avoid the disruption to the life of these schools that is involved in closing them for a day every time there is an election.\nAdmiring the persistence you put into your site and in depth information you provide.

Trish, Louise and Richard were part of the team working for Luke in the period leading up to the election.

Luke made an excellent maiden speech in the House on 8 October, taking the opportunity to emphasise what a great place Sutton is.\nThis success followed on from some remarkable victories for Liberal Democrat candidates in the local elections held nationwide on 2 May 2024. Across England, Liberal Democrats won 521 Council seats, more than the Tories, with a net gain of 104 seats.\nTrish stood as our candidate in the Greater London Authority constituency elections. Our constituency covered Croydon as well as Sutton so this was not a winnable seat for the Liberal Democrats. However, Trish performed remarkably well. She pushed our share of the vote up from 14.4% to 15.8%. We were one of only five constituencies where we beat both the Greens and Reform, taking third place in the constituency member vote.\nIn the Mayoral election our candidate, Rob Blackie, performed well. Sadiq Khan won the Mayoralty despite the unpopularity locally of ULEZ, a policy we have opposed. Our views on ULEZ are set out in articles further down. Below is a photo of our visit to City Hall, the HQ of the Mayor of London, on 30 June 2023 to present the petition expressing opposition to ULEZ signed by over 10 000 Sutton residents.",

I will ask the residents of Grosvenor Court to let me know if the motorbikes used by the pizza house wind up being parked on the pavement outside, something I fear. The Inspector has imposed some conditions on the use of the pizza house, which is helpful to a degree, and I hope that our representations were instrumental in getting these imposed, though they will not fully meet the concerns of the residents.”\nThe Inspector imposed conditions relating to the extraction system, hours of opening, noise emissions and sound reduction measures, as well as requiring that the extract duct be painted black to protect the outlook of nearby residents.\nCouncillor Clifton had called for the rejection of the application, responding to objections raised with Sutton South LibDem Councillors by a number of residents. He twice spoke against it at meetings of the Development Control Committee.\nCouncillor Clifton argued that the application had a number of defects, citing:\n– the adverse effect on the amenities of residents in the large block of mansion flats above the shop by virtue of increased noise, fumes, traffic and parking problems contrary to policies TSC5 and TSC7, in particular due to the the continuous arrival and departure of motor bikes during the hours of operation in what is an area of concentrated residential occupation\n– the lack of available parking close to the restaurant for six motorcycles during hours of operation, with the likelihood that they will be parked on and block the pavement\n– the cumulative effect of a third vent pipe on the Grosvenor Court building on the appearance of this building\n– the inadequacy of arrangements for dealing with waste.\nCouncillor Clifton spoke against the proposals at meetings of the Sutton Council Development Control Committee, as a Ward Councillor, on 11 August and 3 November 2010.",

Richard estimates that possibly approaching a thousand residents in our Ward are relying on Universal Credit during the pandemic and perhaps 200 residents in our Ward will have to rely on Foodbanks if the current level of Universal Credit is cut.\nResearch by the Trussell Trust has shown that one in five people receiving the Universal Credit benefit said they are very likely to need to use a food bank if the benefit is cut. Almost one in five said they would be likely to fall behind on housing costs, such as mortgage payments or rent.\nThe Government has yet to say whether the temporary increase, introduced at the start of the pandemic and in place until the end of March, will be extended.\nRichard says “We have no reason to believe that Sutton South Ward is much different from the rest of Sutton. While the Ward is sometimes regarded as more affluent, as local Councillors we know there are pockets of extreme poverty, not just on our social housing estates. The benefit system, though cut significantly in recent years, is a lifeline for struggling families, and has prevented many families in our Ward needing to turn to a food bank. We call on the Government to maintain Universal Credit at its current level.”",

They are the NHS decision makers for South West London:\n“The six south west London CCGs are actively discussing the next steps for local health services following the withdrawal of Surrey Downs CCG from the BSBV programme. As we have made clear in the past, the BSBV business case is now invalid and the options put forward through the programme are no longer on the table for consultation. It follows that all six CCGs are in the process of dissolving the committees to which they had delegated decision-making on BSBV.\n“However, the challenges outlined in the BSBV case for change remain. If we do not address these challenges, we know that local services will decline in quality and that we will not be able to meet the required quality and safety standards. We are discussing with each other and with our boards how we address these challenges and we hope to make a further announcement in February.”\nThe key phrase is “The challenges outlined in the BSBV case for change remain”. They are right in saying this. Too many people do go to A&E, who should instead be going to a pharmacist or their local GP. The reason they do is often because they can not get an appointment with their GP and they do not realise that visiting a pharmacist is even an option!\nWe are concerned that even though the BSBV business case is now invalid, the original solution proposed by the six CCGs of closing St Helier A&E and closing St Helier’s Maternity Ward still remain as favoured options, by the CCGs. We have to wait to see what they say.\nAn indication was given on 18 February when GPs and healthcare professionals from across South West London announced that the BSBV review that recommended the closure of key healthcare services at St Helier hospital has been scrapped.\nA new strategy on how to deliver health services in our area will now be developed by local Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) so that the best possible care can be delivered in the future.\nWe welcome that, in contrast with the failed BSBV review, healthcare services will be viewed in a holistic way and that the CCGs will be working closely with all health providers and local authorities to deliver high quality care services.\nWhile t is good news that the BSBV review has been scrapped we still need to continue demonstrating our support for St Helier and make sure that essential health services remain accessible.\nWe want to see Sutton CCG working closely with St Helier Hospital, Sutton Council (Adult Social Services and Childrens Social Services) and the Royal Marsden (Community Health Visitors) to resolve the issues raised by the original BSBV plan, and not promoting the closure of the A and E Department at St Helier.",

This was the charge made by Councillor Richard Clifton at the Sutton Council meeting on 7 March.\nThe Tories oppose a plan to close four offices the Council does not need, a reduction in office space achieved by moving staff to a more efficient way of working that involves “hot desking” and the use of new technology.\nCouncillor Clifton – who works for an organisation that that made this move and himself “hot desks” – claims that the new system of office organisation saves millions of pounds as it reduces the need for office space, enables you to close unwanted office buildings, and is a more efficient way of working. “Hot desking” involves using new technology (remote access email, mobile phones, Blackberries etc) so that people can work remotely, from home or while “out and about” on Council business, part of the time. They do not have their own desk in the office but use any desk that is free on the days they need to go to the office.\nThis innovation, which many businesses have implemented to cut costs, will enable the Council to close offices and save money. Some up-front costs are involved to invest in the technology and re-organise the office so people can “hot desk”. But Councillor Clifton argues that in the long run it saves millions of pounds, from reduced need for buildings and because it is a more efficient way of working.\nAn “Outline Business Case” showed a minimum saving of at least a quarter of a million pounds per year, but Councillor Clifton told the Council meeting that his own experience of more flexible ways of working suggests the savings are under-estimated and there are huge savings to be made in the long term.\nUnderlying this dispute is a more fundamental issue about social change in Britain. Councillor Clifton pointed out that new technology that enables people to work remotely is changing the way we work. The traditional model of office work, where all the work is done between 9 and 5 in a building that people commute for hours to reach, is disappearing. This is due to a combination of new technology and changing social attitudes as people seek the efficiencies and flexibility in work patterns that the new technology makes possible.\n“The Tories in Sutton are totally out of touch with the realities of modern industrial organisation,”\nsaid Councillor Clifton. “They would shackle us to a disappearing model of the organisation of work that would force us to keep open buildings we do not need, reduce staff efficiency, and cost us a packet of money. They are the new Luddites.”\n[NOTE: the Conservative Councillors opposed further work on the project, even though the business case showed, at this point, savings. Later work suggested uncertainty about the figures and, in accordance with our commitment to evidence-based policies, the project was ultimately dropped. ]\nI like suttonsouth.mycouncillor.org.uk, bookmarked\nbet et home",

Amongst other things we:\n– sought re-assurance from the police about police resources in Sutton, given the evidence that police resources are stretched that Richard heard at the Licensing Committee hearing he attended on 28 March (see post below “Late Night Noise Danger Averted”)\n– obtained agreement to litter bins being provided at locations suggested to us by residents, including Grange Road and Upland Road\n– established the way forward on the Eastleigh Close parking scheme, and the Bonchurch Close yellow lining (removal thereof) scheme\n– heard a presentation on the new bin collection scheme. We noted that local authorities have suffered 26% cuts in Government funding of running costs, in real terms, and 29% of capital programmes since 2010, and Sutton Council has done well to keep the Council tax frozen for three years while avoiding draconian cuts like closing libraries. The new bin collection scheme will save £500 000. There may be a few rough edges, to be ironed out in the next few weeks, but it is a worthwhile scheme\n– noted further proposals for the expansion of primary schools, including The Avenue, which some of our residents send their children to. We noted that the expansion of Devonshire Avenue school had been successfully completed with no adverse consequences, and the school did well in its OFTED inspection. We noted that the percentage of children born in the Borough entering State primary schools had risen from below 84% in 2007/8 to almost 94% in 2010/11, due to the recession coupled with the high quality of Sutton’s State primary schools leading to parents turning their back on private education. This is what has caused the need to expand primary schools.",

Trish was first elected in 2014 and was re-elected in 2018 and 2022. Louise was elected in 2022. Richard served as Mayor of Sutton for 2016-17 and Trish was our Mayor for a record three yearly terms, to May 2023. Louise is our Deputy Mayor for a second successive year, through to May 2025.\nLouise, Richard and Trish at City Hall presenting the petition opposing ULEZ signed by over 10 000 Sutton residents\nCONTINUE DOWN THE PAGE TO OUR CURRENT NEWS STORIES\nOR CLICK ON THE LINKS BELOW TO GO TO OUR SPECIFIC PAGES\nThe statue “The Messenger” by David Wynne, in The Quadrant, is close to the boundary between our Ward and Sutton Central Ward\nOn 10 April there was a remarkable victory for the Liberal Democrat candidate, Richard Choi, in a by-election to elect a Councillor for Sutton Central Ward on Sutton Council. Sutton Central Ward is immediately north of our Ward, Sutton South.\nRichard got more votes than all the other six candidates added together. The result was\nLiberal Democrats 1291\nConservatives 327\nReform 282\nLabour 216\nThree other candidates (the Greens, an independent and the Christian People’s Alliance) each got less than 100 votes.\nThe Liberal Democrat share of the vote increased by 17.4%, the Conservatives fell by 10% and Labour – who finished second in this seat in 2022 – by 17.4%.\nOn 3 March the Council discussed the budget proposals for the coming year. Legally, the Council is required to set a balanced budget. With so many Councils going bust or in great financial difficulty, this was always going to be a difficult task. The problems are due to a legacy of Government cuts but also a big spike in demand for services. While people think of the Council as the body that mends the potholes, empties the bins and fixes the street lights, 70% of spending is on adult social care and children’s services (particularly for those children with special educational needs), plus the cost of finding accommodation for the homeless. There has been an increase in demand in the past year, particularly in the number of adults whose social care has to be paid for by the Council, the number of children with special educational needs and in the number of homeless families.\nRichard spoke in the debate, on homelessness – a subject in which he has a special interest due to the work history of his daughter, Ellie, who worked for many years for a homelessness charity and because as chair of Planning Committee he has a role in increasing the supply of affordable family accommodation.\nHere is Richard’s speech:\n“I would like to direct the attention of Council to paragraph 8.11 of the supplemental agenda which is discussing financial risks.\nIt says that the biggest driver of overspending by London boroughs is the number of people presenting as homeless and who need to be offered temporary accommodation.\nThe paper tells us Sutton had 1 084 households homeless and in temporary accommodation in October last year. It is a higher figure tonight. It is a frightening figure. Tonight we are discussing homelessness as a financial risk to the Council, but we all recognise that the fundamental reason for our concern is that behind so many of these cases are stories of tragedy, of families losing their homes and often winding up in bed and breakfast accommodation remote from their workplace and remote from the schools their children attend.\nThere is a housing crisis and we need more homes. Residents comment on the number of new flats being built in the centre of Sutton but we need this accommodation.\nThe aspiration of the Government to build more homes is right – but it has to be tempered by a concern about quality and about dealing with the consequences.\nSutton is very built up. It is not always easy to see where the new homes will come from, particularly when we are all rightly sensitive to the concerns of residents about inappropriate development and the pressures intensification can bring.\nIt is worthwhile re-stating the principles in our local plan for Sutton.\nWe need more housing, but it must be of good quality – good enough for Sutton, which means of high quality.\nWe aim to reduce development pressures on what I call the “suburban heartland” of the borough by concentrating development in the areas where development is appropriate.\nIn particular there is a zone of potential intensification close to the town centre where public transport connections are good. This may mean some tall buildings. It may mean car free or car light development as you can provide much more accommodation if you do not have to provide a parking space for every unit, and this is more acceptable in areas close to the railway station and the town centre where public transport connections are good.\nWe have a local plan, currently under review, which sets out how we meet the requirements for infrastructure to support an increase in population, which is an important concern of residents.\nI am always keen to point out that our local plan is not like the local plan you might find in, for example, North Korea, mandating what will be built. It is aspirational. It depends on developers bringing forward proposals. Its success depends a lot on the skills of our planning staff in negotiating with developers to secure what is good for Sutton, which may not be what makes most profit for the developer. I would like to pay tribute to the work of our planning staff and in particular the head, Andy Webber, who retires this month.\nIn the past year the planning system has had a bad press. The Government says we are going for growth, growth, growth. Quite right. But when asked what are the impediments to growth they invariably cite the planning system – which is represented as run by NIMBYS frustrating necessary development. That might well be the case in some places – not here in Sutton of course. But I think there is a counter argument that the planning system is a bastion against having fields and fields of sub-standard housing, as that is what makes money for developers. We destroy the planning system at our peril. But it is also right that we need a planning system that does not stand in the way of necessary change and renewal, but ensures high quality and appropriate development, to provide housing and to stimulate the economy.\nI think we have a good track record in Sutton in supporting high quality development and there are many examples in our borough of developments characterised by good design providing quality housing and infrastructure. That is what we need.”\nThe bench at the junction of The Ridgway and Mayfield Road\nThere are a number of locations in our Ward where there are benches to enable weary pedestrians to put up their feet. At the most recent meeting of the Council’s local committee we got agreement to re-new two benches in the Ward that have deteriorated over time. These are benches in Copse Hill and the one in the photograph, which is at the junction of The Ridgway and Mayfield Road.\nThere is a history to some of the benches in our Ward. In 1988 the South Sutton Neighbourhood Association celebrated the tenth anniversary of its foundation by funding a bench in Cavendish Road close to Ambleside Gardens. The bench was, after over twenty years of use and exposure to the elements, in a very sorry state. We took action to get the bench restored, with the plaque explaining the history of the bench moved to the new bench.\nOn the 27th of January Sutton Council met. Richard raised the issue of the reasons why a recent survey by The Times newspaper ranked Sutton as the eighth most attractive place to live in England. This finding does not surprise us. We spend a lot of time knocking on the doors of our residents to introduce ourselves as your local Councillors and we find people generally say they really like Sutton, mentioning a strong sense of community, open spaces, low crime, good schools, a green and pleasant environment, parks, street trees, being convenient for London and for the countryside. This is particularly the case with people who have moved to Sutton from elsewhere, particularly those from other London boroughs, from Hong Kong and from Ukraine. Please write to us and tell us what you like about Sutton or think we can improve.\nWe are always keen to look at ways of improving our Ward.\nLast year traffic engineers undertook a study of traffic flows in our Ward and the results of the exercise are listed in a later post on this site. The results have not led to some “standout” conclusion as to a problem that needs tackling but traffic officers are examining three main issues:\nwhether action can be taken to improve the safety and the experience of pedestrians crossing the Kings Lane bridge without closing the road to vehicles. The bridge is narrow. Installing a second bridge would be impossibly expensive. Marking a pedestrian path at one side of the road might be feasible. We would welcome the views of users of the bridge, both pedestrians and motorists\nsimilarly, whether something can be done to improve the safety and the experience of pedestrians passing under the railway bridge in Langley Park Road. Some proposals are to be consulted on\npossible improvements to the busy junction where Cedar Road crosses Langley Park Road. Residents have spoken to us of the difficulties pedestrians have in crossing Langley Park Road. Consultation with residents in adjacent streets is underway on proposals to install two new traffic islands in Langley Park Road. These will form a safe area in the middle of the road so the road can be crossed by pedestrians in two phases.\nYour views on these issues, and views on any other traffic and parking issues you would like us to look at would be welcomed.\nThe police met residents of Sutton South Ward again on the evening of 15 January 2025, at Devonshire Avenue school. There are open, public meetings held quarterly at which the police discuss the policing of the Ward with local residents. We were addressed by our Ward Constable, Constable Robyn Skivens, who went through the crime statistics for the Ward. Sutton has a lower crime rate than most outer London boroughs and our Ward has one of the lowest crime rates in Sutton. However, crime always has a significant impact on the victim and public concern remains high. The draft minutes of the meeting are as below.\nSUTTON SOUTH COMMUNITY / POLICE MEETING. 15 JANUARY 2025 Attended by PC Robyn Skivens and PCSO Helen Maguire for the police. A report was given on main crime trends from 1 September to the date of the meeting. DRUG OFFENCES There had been 18 drug offences, mainly possession of drugs, mainly cannabis. While this was higher than normal the increase was partly attributable to a special police operation at Sutton train station. Four of these crimes were the interception by the Border Force of drug shipments. Where such a shipment is to premises in our Ward it will count in our statistics. BURGLARY There had been 21 burglaries or attempted burglaries. This included residential burglaries, burglaries of garages and sheds, and some burglaries of businesses. It was noted that there was usually a seasonal increase in burglary at this time of year as it was darker earlier. There had been eight residential burglaries. However, some that had been reported in sheltered accommodation in the Ward were later disproved and attributed to dementia. A disturbing case was that of a landlord who was able to let himself into a flat and commit theft. Two burglaries of garages had involved theft of bicycles. Mention was made of a shop in Brighton Road where the window was smashed and the wooden panel that was then put in place to secure the premises was pulled away to facilitate burglary. Mention was made of the theft of tools from a construction site in the Ward. Some burglaries had involved the theft of keys, which were then used to commit further offences (theft of a car key leading to theft of a car). The police stressed the need to make sure keys were kept out of sight – if the keys can be seen from your letterbox you are inviting crime.\nVEHICLE CRIME\nThere had been 14 instances of vehicle crime (theft of vehicles, damage to vehicles, theft from vehicles). The police stressed the need to avoid leaving anything of value on display in your car, or in the car at all. An unusual crime had been the theft of an excavator and a dumper from the road works in Brighton Road. THEFT There had been 23 crimes in a category the police described as “theft and kindred (to theft)” events. This included shoplifting, parcel theft, theft of pedal cycles and mobile phones. Examples mentioned included theft of scrap metal, theft of a wheelie bin and theft of a wedding ring by distraction techniques. MAJOR CRIMES There had been nine major, violent crimes in the Ward. This included several robberies at the train station, a large group altercation outside a restaurant, a fight between two drug users, and a concerning incident of a woman who was followed from the station and robbed. There were also two incidents of arson, of a bin and of a Ford transit. A ULEZ camera was deliberately damaged. There was an incident where a drug user was searched and a knife, and bladed articles, were found to be in his possession. There was a disturbing incident of an anti-semitic symbol being daubed on a wall outside the synagogue in Cedar Road. There had been a succession of incidents related to a woman living in Cedar Road who had engaged in anti- social activities that had attracted a community of drug users to her premises. This was now the subject of police reports to the DPS that were expected to lead to her being charged with serious offences. SPEEDING The police had been conducting a programme of visits to local care homes and sheltered housing to talk about scams. Residents had raised with them concerns about speeding in Cavendish Road, which had led to police action in that road. There was a discussion of speeding in local roads including Chalgrove Road, Langley Park Road, The Ridgway and Cavendish Road. The police had been carrying out speed checks in Chalgrove Road and Cavendish Road. The action in Cavendish Road had led to twelve drivers receiving warnings. The police would consider further action against speeding in local roads, subject to resources.\nOTHER MATTERS DISCUSSED Staffing levels: There should be in theory be a third officer on the Ward to support Robyn and Helen, but they were coping. The number of “extractions” when they were called away to join police exercises elsewhere in London, or at the Croydon custody suite, remained an issue of concern but was now running close to 35% of their time rather than the 50% it had once been. Mention was made of local concern about a story that a body had been discovered at a house in Egmont Road. The police assured the meeting that there was no wider implication of this incident. The next meeting was tentatively scheduled for Wednesday 14 May at Devonshire Avenue school (7pm) subject to the police checking their work rota. The meeting thanked Robyn for coming back from leave to attend the meeting and thanked the officers for their work for the community in dealing with crime in the Ward. The meeting thanked Fiona Ostler for letting us meet at the school. The date of the next meeting was provisionally set as Wednesday 14 May, at Devonshire Avenue primary school and thought continues to be given to what could be done to better publicise the meeting and get a better attendance.\nConstable Skivens, Louise, Trish and Richard with other Ward police officers at the Sutton South Hello Christmas party\nThe Phoenix Concert Band – which is based in our Ward and for which Richard plays trumpet – were busy over the Christmas period raising money for the Mayor of Sutton’s charity appeal. The band practices every Friday in the church at Christchurch in Christchurch Park. A concert in the church, staged by the band in December, drew an audience of over a hundred and raised £790 for the charity appeal. The band also played Christmas carols at an event in the Straw cafe in Manor Park in December, which raised £360. On the last Saturday before Christmas the band joined a wider group of musicians to play Christmas carols in the atrium of the St Nicholas shopping centre in Sutton (see photo) which raised £180, so £1330 in all. We were grateful to the Mayor, Councillor Colin Stears, who attended all these events. In addition the band played a concert at the Friends’ Meeting House in Cedar Road on the second Saturday in December, to entertain an enthusiastic audience before the “Second Saturday Tea” which the Quakers provide every month on the second Saturday. The Mayor of Sutton’s charities are Home-Start, Sutton, and Sutton, Kingston and Epsom – Parkinson’s UK. Our contribution to the appeal was dwarfed by the £10 000 prize for second place in the boroughs’ competition won by the Sutton float in the London New Year’s Day parade.\nWe pride ourselves on the fact that we have a network of dedicated volunteers who deliver our “FOCUS” magazine throughout the Ward. If you have the odd half hour a few times a year to support us in this way please contact us. We recently prepared an end of year newsletter to update our volunteer deliverers on our activities. We thought we would share it with those who look at our website.\n“The last year has been our most successful year in Sutton South Ward. With the election of Luke as our Member of Parliament in July we have, for the first time, three Liberal Democrat Councillors representing our Ward and a Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament representing us at Westminster. We held a successful Ward meeting on 28 November where we heard from Luke on the incredibly busy life he now has as our Member of Parliament. He has been meeting all the important community groups in Sutton and Cheam, and has made speeches in Parliament on a variety of issues – ranging from the importance of support for carers to the future of Taiwan. In his maiden speech he spoke about what a pleasant place Sutton is to live, work and raise a family, a great change from the previous MP who spent all his time running Sutton down. He is enthusiastic about his role as spokesperson for London. As Ward Councillors, we have a lot of local casework that we deal with and are doing more than our fair bit as Chairs of Council committees – Trish chairing the Audit and Governance Committee, Richard the Planning Committee and Louise combining being chair of the Licensing Committee with her role as Deputy Mayor. This is her second year as Deputy Mayor following the three years during which Trish was Mayor.\nLike every local authority, Sutton Council is pre-occupied by financial issues and struggling with some difficult decisions to balance the books. The decision to close the Registrar’s office (The Russetings) in Worcester Road was one we regretted, driven by a need to consolidate services in fewer buildings, but we believe planning controls are sufficient to protect the appearance of this attractive, locally listed, building in the street scene.\nWe have secured funding for improvements to the WArd, including new information signs at the only open space in our Ward – the Devonshire Avenue Nature Area (DANA). Maintenance of the nature area involves a balance of ensuring it is a peaceful place for people to visit while preserving the biodiversity of the site. There is now a Friends of DANA group – let us know if you would like to join it. We are already looking forward to our next electoral challenge, to retain control of the Council in 2026. We need to keep up the work of talking to our residents, delivering our literature and doorknocking. Let us know if you are interested in being one of our candidates. We welcome talking or corresponding with you and with all our residents. We hope to have further Ward meetings next year. We are really grateful for the help we get.”\nSutton South Councillors were concerned to learn about changes proposed to the organisation of the Police Cadets, who meet at a school in our ward. Currently there are over 120 cadets. However, the decision has been made to close junior cadets and cut the remaining senior cadets to just 46. Their future programme is also being severely curtailed. This will have a major impact on the youth of this borough who will no longer have the opportunity to participate in activities such as camps, parades and Duke of Edinburgh awards.\nCouncillor Louise Phelan, whose son has been a Cadet, commented “I’ve seen first-hand the benefits of being part of police cadets. They learn valuable life skills, and gain self confidence. They also support the local community and get to take part in things they wouldn’t otherwise have had the opportunity to do. For many this is a stepping stone into a career within the police force, for others the Cadets help to keep them on the right path and make better life decisions. I am incredibly concerned others will now not get these opportunities.”",

The plans were considered inadequate in that there was no provision for affordable housing and the frontage onto Cedar Road was of an unacceptable design.\nAt the end of 2013 the owners submitted some further plans that remedied these problems. The plans were due to go to the Council’s Development Control Committee on 22 January with a recommendation that they be accepted, and Richard had made arrangements to speak to the Committee in support of the proposals.\nUnexpectedly, a week before the meeting, the developers withdrew the plans.\nRichard says “I supported these proposals for the re-development of Sutherland House. I call on the owners to make clear what their plans now are.\nWith the uplift to the area that will come from the opening of the side entrance to Sutton station, the Sutton Gateway project and the prestige new Subsea7 headquarters, getting Sutherland House re-developed remains the final plank in the strategy to bring jobs, prosperity and good design to our area.”",

Extensive damage had been caused to the flat and the flat downstairs, but mercifully no-one was injured. We spoke to the fire office, the caretaker of the building and the owner of the flat, which had been empty and under renovation at the time.\nLast October, Richard and Trish visited Sutton Court, one of the largest estates in our Ward, having learned of a fire in a flat at the block (see photo). We spoke to the next door neighbour, who lives in the flat opposite on the top floor of their block. She had been concerned at the fire but we were all relieved that no-one was hurt and the damage confined to a single flat.\nThe damage that fires can cause emphasises the need for everyone to fit smoke detectors and carbon monoxide indicators.",

THERE ARE LATER DEVELOPMENTS COVERED IN LATER ARTICLES, ABOVE. THIS ARTICLE IS KEPT ON THE SITE TO SHOW HOW THE PROPOSALS EVOLVED.\nWe would like to again thank residents who have contributed to the two stages of consultation by the Council on parking.\nSince some misinformation has been put round in the Ward, we want to summarise where matters now stand – though all the information on the process is on the Council’s website, click on parking and follow the links to the parking strategy.\nNo decisions have been taken. We await the analysis by the traffic engineers of the results of the second consultation. As Councillors, we only want to do what residents want. We will be guided by the results of consultation and are determined not to impose our own views on this process.\nWhat we know from the first consultation is this. Much of Sutton South Ward experiences a high demand for parking as we are close to the town centre and the railway station. Parking is rationed by having a controlled parking zone (CPZ) but this leads to bumper to bumper parking six days a week in the roads just outside the zone, such as Mayfield Road. The results of the first round of consultation were consistent with previous studies by Councillors, the Council and the residents’ association, in that:\n- there is a strong majority favouring parking controls in Mayfield Road\n- there are more mixed views in Chalgrove Road and The Ridgway but, overall, support for controls\n- there are more mixed views in Upland Road and roads beyond, though less support for parking controls the further you are from the CPZ.\nThe proposals of officers was to introduce controls in Mayfield, The Ridgway and Chalgrove. It will be interesting to see whether the results of the second consultation mean that other roads, in particular Upland Road, want to join the scheme. The objective of having successive consultations was to let residents have a second opportunity to give a view when they could see what was proposed for neighbouring roads, recognising that any parking scheme will lead to some displacement.\nPrevious surveys have suggested that there is no appetite for a full CPZ with machines. The solution adopted with success elsewhere in Sutton, including in Hillcroome Road, is to have a mix of yellow lines operative for an hour a day to deter commuters, with some free to park bays. These bays are needed to cater for residents who will need to park a vehicle on the road and they also reduce the amount of displacement into neighbouring roads, which is a legitimate consideration.\nAn alternative that has been suggested is to have a “residents’ only” parking scheme with residents obtaining a permit to park during controlled hours. Disadvantages are that this scheme would involve extensive signage along the roads involved, bureaucracy, and a cost as the administrative costs of dealing with permit applications would have to be covered by charges for permits. It would also lead to more displacement. We welcome views on that alternative.\nParking has been an issue of concern locally for the 30 years Richard has lived in The Ridgway. We want to tackle this issue though recognising that it is problematic. We are consulting and will do what the majority of residents want, not impose our own solutions.",

The appeal seeks to overturn the decision of Sutton Council to reject the latest planning application for the property, and seeks an award of costs against the Council. We oppose the appeal.\nOur comments are as below. The history of this development is described in our comments. Designs for a block of four small flats were twice rejected by the Council, Richard speaking to the Development Control Committee on the successive applications, but the developer has still built something without planning permission and asked the remote Planning Inspectorate, based in Bristol, to overturn democratic local decisions. We invite residents to use any of this material in framing their own objections.\nSubmissions should be marked “For the attention of Peter Lyne, The Planning Inspectorate.” Quote the reference\nAPPEAL. APP/P5870/A/13/7205143. 39A EATON ROAD, SUTTON, SURREY. SM2 5EA\nThe email address is teamp2@pins.gsi.gov.uk\nPostal address: Peter Lyne, The Planning Inspectorate\n3/10 Wing, TempleQuay House\n2 The Square, Bristol, BS1 6PN\n“Submission by Councillors Richard Clifton and Heather Honour, Liberal Democrat Councillors for Sutton South Ward, London Borough of Sutton.\nAPPEAL. APP/P5870/A/13/7205143.\n39A EATON ROAD, SUTTON, SURREY. SM2 5EA\nWe are Councillors for Sutton South Ward in the London Borough of Sutton, where this property is situated. We ask you to consider the following concerning this appeal.\nThe process followed by the developer has aroused much local disquiet. It is a tale of three designs. The first design was rejected by Sutton Council but passed by the Planning Inspectorate on appeal. There was then a change of ownership of the property and a second design was proposed. This was also turned down by Sutton Council. The developer could at that point have appealed to the Planning Inspectorate but chose not to do so. Instead he demolished the house and built something different from what he had permission for, the third design.\nRegardless of what the Inspectorate now decides on the substance of the case, there would be no justice in any award of costs to the developer, as he has ignored planning law in building something for which he does not have permission, perhaps hoping no-one would notice. Nor would it be right not to ask the developer to mitigate some of the negative effects of the structure built without permission.\nThe structure as built departs from the design for which permission was obtained in a number of ways that we find objectionable. In particular, the overall height is greater and the design of the windows at the front is different. The comment was made by a Councillor at the Development Control Committee discussion that the approved design made it look like a house but the design built made it look more like a block of flats. It is a far less attractive design.\nThere is an oddness about the boundary wall with 6 ConistonGardens. The block of flats has been built right up to the boundary and is so close to the wall of number 6 that it abuts it. This seems to ensure that there will eventually be damp problems for the flats adjacent to this wall and no way of dealing with the problem. In addition the guttering overhangs the adjacent property at this side and it seems inevitable that there will be significant damp problems.\nThe window at the side, facing number 6, is of a changed design that increases overlooking. It is not frosted in any way.\nWe would draw your attention, in particular, to the comments made by the neighbour at number 6, Mrs Kite, and the comments of the Council, both of which we support.\nRICHARD CLIFTON\nHEATHER HONOUR\nCouncillors for Sutton South Ward, London Borough of Sutton.”",
  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_2014_02_15_new-gp-surgery-concerns-not-yet-answered/content_479.html": "In earlier posts on this site we have set out our concerns about the proposed closure of the Grove Road and Belmont surgeries, used by many residents of our Ward, and opening of a replacement surgery in a building in Homeland Drive, in Belmont. This is of particular concern due to the high proportion of over 75s in our Ward (a higher percentage than for any other Ward in Sutton) and the lack of any GP surgery in the Ward. There is a problem of access to the site, which is poorly served by public transport.\nAt the Council’s Strategy and Resources Committee on 11 February and at the Council meeting on 3 March Richard and Heather repeated their opposition to the proposal and pressed for improvements to the proposed community transport scheme. This would go some way to ameliorating our concerns.\nIn speeches to Council on 3 March both Richard and Heather expressed concern that the doctors did not seem interested in proposals from Ruth Dombey, our Council leader, to help find a better alternative site.\nWe are writing to NHS England and continuing our campaign within the decision-taking structures of the NHS. Here is the text of Richard’s speech to Council on 3 March summarising our position.\n“Councillor Honour and I, as Councillors for Sutton South Ward, have consistently opposed the move of the two surgeries to the Henderson hospital site. Our Ward has the highest proportion of elderly residents of any Ward in Sutton and there are many residents of our Ward who go to the Grove Road or Belmont surgeries. Our objection to the site is that it is not sufficiently accessible by public transport. What has been offered by way of a community transport service, to deal with this problem, is a help but does not resolve the problem.\nThis motion applauds the efforts made by Councillor Dombey to resolve this issue, and I would like to warmly support that sentiment.\nThis is a decision taken by local doctors who work within the National Health Service. I understand from the evidence that NHS England gave to the Council’s Scrutiny Committee last year that the doctors have to put their case for the move to NHS England. Councillor Honour and I have written to NHS England to remind them of their responsibilities in this matter and ask them not to endorse this decision.\nThe local authority has come into this by the back door in three ways. First, as local planning authority, because the doctors need planning permission for the building. I sat through the discussion at the Development Control Committee and respect the fact that the Committee concluded ultimately that there were insufficient planning grounds to turn down the application. Its decisions are subject to appeal to the Planning Inspectorate so it cannot capriciously ignore the published planning policies. Second, I understand that the authority is a joint owner of the site but legal advice is that the Council would be in breach of contract were it not to proceed to completion of the sale – if the decision is taken, by the doctors and the NHS, to go ahead with this move. Third, the offer of Councillor Dombey to act as a mediator. I still hope that will be taken up.\nSo the spotlight has to focus on the decision-taking processes in the NHS.\nCouncillor Honour and I have written to NHS England to remind them of their responsibilities in this matter and urge them consider alternatives to this decision.”\nHere is the text of our letter to NHS England.\n“Unsuitable Location for Proposed GP Surgery in Sutton\nAs Councillors for Sutton South Ward in the London Borough of Sutton we are deeply concerned at proposals to close two GP surgeries and replace them with a new medical surgery at a site unsuitable for many of our residents.\nThere is at present no GP surgery in our Ward, which has the highest proportion of residents aged over 70 of any Ward in the Borough of Sutton. Our residents use a number of local surgeries but many go to the surgery at Grove Road in the centre of Sutton and to the Belmont surgery, close to Belmont railway station. These are to close, under the proposals.\nThe proposed new medical centre is in Homeland Drive, at the site of the former Henderson hospital. However, the site is not sufficiently accessible for the elderly and those without a car. It is rated PTAL 1b, which means that it is not accessible to public transport. It is in fact at least 300 metres up a steepish inclined road that is dark and uninviting. Our GPs state that 75% of patients will use a car. The remainder are likely to be elderly, unable to drive a car, or on a low income. They also are likely to be amongst the most frequent patients at the surgery.\nThere are severe limitations on the use of dial-a-ride and taxicard, so use of these services is not an option for people who find it difficult to access public transport and this site.\nThe statistics on the population of the Ward illustrate the problem. Sutton South has much more sheltered housing, and more care homes than other parts of the Borough. 2.94% of Ward residents live in managed residential accommodation compared to a Borough average of 0.78%. Over 75 per cent of properties in Sutton South are flats, many of them single occupancy. 46.3% of households in Sutton South are single person households, with 15.5% occupied by people over 65. The population of the Ward is elderly.\nSutton South Sutton average National average\nOver 65s 17.49% 14.32% 16.74%\nOver 75s 10.62% 7.07% 7.96%\nOver 85s 4.13% 2.1% 2.31%\nAlthough 73% of residents in the Borough say they are ‘well connected’, 10% of respondents in Sutton South say “they have no one to turn to locally for help”, compared to a Borough average of 6%. This means that they would not have people to assist them with transport.\nWe therefore consider that the proposed site for the new GP surgeries does not meet the needs of the most vulnerable in our Ward and we would prefer a more accessible site.\nFrom the information that we have received it does not appear that the GPs have considered the transport needs of their elderly patients, a growing demographic, who will need to use the surgery often, possibly as much as once a week for visits to the other services at the centre as well as their GPs. Many have said to us that they will need to change their doctor if this goes ahead.\nIn response to our concerns the developer of the site, Assura, has offered a community transport scheme. However, after close examination of this, it does not appear to be a practicable solution.\nOnce again the NHS, which declares that it is patient centred, is failing its patients by not taking account of their transport needs. This has been a major local issue in the abortive Better Services Better Value plans to change the status of our local hospital, St Helier.\nIt is by no means clear to us what the process is in the NHS to take a wider view of the optimum location of GP surgeries in the interests of the patients. However, we understand from evidence that NHS England gave to Sutton Council’s Scrutiny Committee last year that NHS England have a role. We would therefore like to meet you to discuss how you conside that these proposals meet the needs of our most vulnerable residents and your most needy patients.\nYours sincerely.\nRICHARD CLIFTON\nHEATHER HONOUR”",

She has recently been interviewed by both BBC radio and BBC television about these allegations, that pornographic films have been shot at public locations in the Borough, including one close to her home. Trish rightly said she was outraged by this, as it was an act of indecency in public, and children or other members of the public might observe it. The police should take action if they encounter such behaviour and seek additional powers if more powers are needed.\nThere is, of course, no evidence that this type of filming of obscene acts is any more prevalent in Sutton than elsewhere, as no-one is collecting data, but one has to have a concern about the people taking part in such filming (are these trafficked women?) and the possibility that such public acts of indecency might be observed by people, who will of course be horrified.

They were concerned at a likely impact on late night noise problems in the area.\nFollowing discussions with residents, Richard submitted representations on the prevention of public nuisance to Sutton’s Licensing Committee, and spoke at the public hearing held on 28 March.\nHe pointed out that it would be a matter of concern for premises so close to many residential properties to be offering music, dancing, films and sale of alcohol (for consumption on and off the premises) until 4.30am, seven nights a week, and then – after a break of just a few hours – starting again at 9.00am. The application, if approved, would lead to an unacceptable degree of public nuisance, particularly due to noise from people coming away from the premises into neighbouring streets in the early hours of the morning.\nAlthough the premises are not in Sutton South Ward, some of the people coming away from the club in the early hours would walk through our Ward. Concerns had been raised by the police about disturbance and noise late at night, drunken people walking home, alcohol-related brawls and anti-social behaviour. The application should be refused.\nWe are pleased say that the application was refused, the Committee citing in particular problems with noise, community impact and alcohol-related crime.",
  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_page_18/content_625.html": "At the meeting of Sutton Council on 23 May, when the new Mayor is elected and the membership of committees are changed, Trish and Richard took on new responsibilities. Trish continues a s a member of the Housing, Economy and Business Committee, is elected to the Standards Committee, and will sit on the Merton and Sutton Joint Cemetery Board. Richard stands down as chair of Planning Committee and is elected Mayor for the next year.\nHere is the text of Richard’s acceptance speech.\n“I have during the six years that I have been a member of this Council served under five Mayors, three of whom are currently members of the Council. All of them did the job with great distinction. Gloria and I will do our best to continue in that tradition.\nI have many people to thank, but can I particularly thank our musicians. My good friends John, George, Rachel, Stephen and Andrew. When I was first elected to the Council there was a tradition of having some music during the natural interval that occurs in the middle of these annual meetings. It somehow lapsed but I was determined to revive it with – of course – brass musical instruments.\nLast year there was a review of the functions of the Mayor. The review report noted the long tradition in the cities, towns and boroughs of our country of the office of a Mayor, and in London the history can be traced back to 1189. But the report included proposals to bring the Mayor of Sutton into the 21st. century by promoting the Mayor through, and I quote the report, “twitter, facebook and a Mayoral blog on the Council’s website.” I hope this will become required reading for all of you and I will try to find something interesting or amusing to say each week, and you can give me marks out of ten.\nOf course, these different Mayors, stretching back to 1189, had a wide variety of ceremonial and policy functions. The promotion of charities to aid those less fortunate in life is however a recurring theme throughout, and a role of the Mayor that continues, which brings me to the subject of charities. I am pleased to be able to tell you of the two charities I propose we support this year.\nThese are Sutton Shopmobility and the Altzheimer’s Society. The Altzheimer’s society has a strong presence in Sutton and the Council has worked hard on the theme of being a dementia friendly organisation. I have a personal interest as both of my late parents had severe dementia late in life and were cared for by family members who were greatly helped by the society. And it is the families and carers who often most need most support.\nShopmobility is probably thought of by many of you as a provider of mobility scooters to help people shop in the town centre, but the organisation has a much wider role and outreach to help all those with mobility problems, and there are many in the borough who would be completely housebound without this help. And we have Councillor Patel’s mobility scooter here to show us how important it is. In the audience tonight are some representatives of the charities and I hope Councillors will want to discuss the work of these charities with them later thisevening.\nI would also like to appeal to all Councillors and indeed to everyone in this room to make a resolution to support the Mayor’s charitable appeal, and support at least one of the Mayor’s charity events this year, to support these worthy organisations.\nNow, finally, I am advised that the Mayor may appoint a Chaplin and I am delighted that the Reverend Justine Middlemiss has agreed to be my Chaplin. Justine covers a number of churches in Sutton including the splendid Victorian church, Christchurch, in my Ward, which has splendid acoustics – as I know from playing the trumpet, a small part in a big band, in the church.\nNow, Justine asked me a very pertinent question when I spoke to her about being the Mayor’s Chaplin. She asked me what do I want a Chaplin for? Well, part of the job description is to give the Mayor spiritual guidance and spiritual uplift. And being as human as everyone else, there are moments I feel a bit down and in need of spiritual uplift. Whether or not I need much spiritual uplift in the next year may depend a bit on you – I am talking to the Councillors now – and on whether you are well behaved and orderly when I come to chair these meetings.\nBut I have an advantage. For the last two years of my life I have chaired Planning Committee. And if there is any one member of the Council who sometimes needs a bit of spiritual uplift it is the chair of Planning Committee. So can I say how delighted I am that a Councillor of the calibre of Councillor Bourne is succeeding me in taking on this portfolio. She will do the job much better than I did. And Sam, if you find, as I did, that from time to time you need a bit of spiritual uplift – I will loan you Justine.\nNow in a moment, if I can dispose of the rest of the agenda with dispatch, and I know Councillors will want to help me do this, we are going to enjoy the traditional reception put on by the incoming Mayor at these annual meetings. This is not a celebration of me, Councillor Patel and Councillor Cooke moving into these positions. It is a celebration we have once a year of the civic traditions of Sutton and our shared commitment to public service to the benefit of our residents. We know that there are sometimes pointed exchanges across the floor of the Council but there is much more that unites all of us in this room than that divides us. It is a mutual respect and a mutual belief that we all share in the virtues of public service, we would not be Councillors unless we had that shared belief, and tonight I would like you to share with me a celebration of these virtues.\nThat concludes my remarks under item 5, except to say it is a great honour to be elected Mayor of the borough. I am deeply touched. Gloria and I will do everything to repay the trust you have shown in us. It will be a great year for all of us, and I sincerely thank you.”",

Officers from Sutton Council’s Biodiversity Team were on hand to show them how to best plant the trees and teach them about how the trees will grow.\nIt is hoped the nature reserve will eventually be home to a small orchard, which will complement the existing wildlife, which includes bees, butterflies – including the scarce small blue butterfly and other insects.\nThe orchard is being rejuvenated as part of a wider project to improve the site for the local community, which we have spearheaded as Liberal Democrat Councillors for the Ward. Further plans include new benches and a self-guided nature trail.\nHeather said “It was wonderful to see the children enjoying themselves, and learning so much at the same time: how chalk developed from microscopic sea creatures millions of years ago; how to plant trees using a mixture of the original soil and compost and how to encourage wildlife. These lessons will stay with them for a long time”\nCouncillor Graham Tope, Executive Member for Community Safety, Leisure and Libraries at Sutton Council, said: “The pupils from Devonshire Primary School worked very hard to plant these trees, and I’m sure that in years to come they’ll be proud to come back and see the fruits of their labour.\n“This is a great asset for the local community, and with more features on the way to make it even more usable, I hope local residents will make the most of it this spring and catch a glimpse of some beautiful natural wildlife.”",

He cited cases he had found of people being charged 1 737% for loans, on a day when the Bank of England Base Rate stood at 0.5%.\nHe called for legal controls on the maximum amount that could be charged for credit. Here is the full text of his speech, contributing to discussion of a motion welcoming the work of the Savers’ Credit Union:\n“There are two themes to this motion. First, ensuring those who, for whatever reason, need access to affordable credit can obtain affordable credit, and the motion rightly commends to us the work of the Savers’ Credit Union in achieving this goal.\nThe second theme is the flip side. It is a much darker theme, and concerns protecting and helping vulnerable people who, perhaps because of the desperate circumstances they find themselves in, take out loans offered at crazy rates of interest by loan sharks, people who offer unsecured loans at high rates of interest to individuals, sometimes enforcing repayment by blackmail or threats of violence.\nSo can I draw Council’s attention, in particular, to the sentence in the motion:\n“ This Council calls on the Government to introduce a cap on the total lending rate that can be charged for providing credit”\nI know the problem is not just the level of the interest rate:\n* it is sometimes a lack of clarity about the interest rate atall\n* it is the way people are targeted, and\n* the way re-payment is enforced.\nBut it is salutary that I looked last week at some websites, found by just typing “loans” into a few search engines. Websites are the top end of the market compared to what is sadly typical, a man touring our social housing estates with a bunch of used fivers in one pocket and a vaguely worded contract in the other.\nThe websites I found had top banners reading “GET THE CASH YOU NEED TODAY”, and “YOU COULD HAVE £1000 IN YOUR ACCOUNT TODAY”. But if you go on clicking you find the truth.\nThe first one I looked at had an APR of 51%.\nThe second had an APR of 1 737%. To make sure I had not mis-read this I checked the site again today, and the rate had gone down. It was only 1 734%.\nThe DirectGov website quotes examples of over 8 000 %, being charged to people who “GET THE CASH THEY NEED TODAY” because they are already desperate, before they have to face the consequences of taking out these loans. Once they have have taken out loans at these rates of interest they never escape from the spiral of debt\nI said “crazy” rates of interest. Why not criminal ? Why should it be lawful to offer vulnerable people loans at these rates of interest on a day when the Bank of England base rate is 0.5%. Some people do try to justify these rates of interest – saying there is a market, these are unsecured loans, the lender has to be protected against bad debts. But there is no justification for such staggering high rates of interest.\nI see no reason why some upper limit could not be set by law and enforced.\nThat would require regulation – a dirty word in some quarters but it is the regulators who protect the vulnerable. And since financial regulation in the UK has such a poor track record it would be good to give the financial regulators a chance to retrieve their reputation.\nThe motion says “This Council calls on the Government to introduce a cap on the total lending rate that can be charged for providing credit”\nI ask you to support the motion.”",

For the second year in a row, Sutton has been given the least in London, leaving the council with less money to invest in the transport infrastructure.\nfrustrated councillors have criticised the Mayor for failing to invest in Sutton, despite the borough’s track record in delivering innovative transport plans.\nCllr Simon Wales, Executive Member for Communities, Transport and Voluntary Sector on Sutton Council, said: “Sutton has a great track record in running innovative and successful transport schemes, but we need money to make them work. The council and members of the local community work together to make sure the transport system keeps getting better and better but the fact remains that we could do even more if we had more funding.\n“I’m disappointed that the Mayor and TfL won’t give Sutton the same kind of grant that it awards to other boroughs. This means that some of the improvements that we have planned will have to be cut back, or even shelved completely. We think that Sutton’s residents deserve better, and will continue working hard to carry out transport improvements that the local community wants to see.”\nAs well as schemes to boost traffic flow and make travel more sustainable, LIP funding is used to make the borough’s roads safer. Maintenance works are financed through a separate budget, but improvements to reduce the number of road accidents often come out of LIP resources. Transport investment is particularly important in the current economic climate, as good accessibility is one of the factors that help town centres and local shops to thrive.\nIn Sutton, LIP money has been used to continue the successful initiatives on sustainable transport under the scheme known as Smarter Travel Sutton, which increased cycling by 75 per cent and is now used as example by other councils, after the initial project came to an end.",

On 23 March Richard visited the school to see the Head, Mr Kersey, and congratulate him.\nThe school achieved “good” ratings in five separate assessment categories:\nLeadership and management – Good\nBehaviour and safety of pupils – Good\nQuality of teaching – Good\nAchievement of pupils – Good\nEarly years provision – Good\nThe summary of key findings prepared by OFSTED is reproduced below/\n“Summary of key findings for parents and pupils\nThis is a good school Under the good leadership of the headteacher and deputy headteacher, there has been a successful drive to improve pupils’ achievement and the quality of teaching. They are well supported by other senior leaders, staff and governors. Consequently, the dip in pupils’ performance which occurred after the last inspection has been successfully addressed. Pupils make good progress from their well below average starting points. By Year 6, their attainment in reading, writing and mathematics is now above average. Pupils of all abilities achieve well with an increasing number making rapid progress in response to stimulating teaching. Improvement is particularly evident in writing which has, rightly, been a focus for development. A very careful watch is kept on the progress of all pupils. Any pupils falling behind because they find learning difficult are quickly given extra help. Provision and children’s progress in the Nursery is outstanding. Exciting learning opportunities encourage children to enjoy learning. Good progress in Reception ensures children get off to a good start. Teaching is good. There are good systems to develop it further. Staff value the support provided by school leaders to help them improve their teaching. School leaders have robust systems for promoting safeguarding. Pupils say they feel safe and are kept safe. They have good attitudes to learning and most behave well both in and out of the classroom. Most parents agree that behaviour is good. Governors give good levels of challenge to school leaders. They have a very detailed knowledge of the school and share everyone’s ambitions for continuous improvement.”\nOur picture, above, is of Trish and Richard at the school in front of the artwork that the pupils prepared that now adorns the hoarding at the Subsea7 site in Brighton Road.\nThis post is worth everyone’s attention.

A resident suggested this was about the point where someone walking back from the station with a takeaway snack would finish it and drop rubbish.\nRe-surfacing of Hillcroome Road to deal with potholes after the hard winter of 2009/2010.\nImprovements to the layout of the Brighton Road at the junction with Ventnor Road and Devonshire Avenue, to reduce road accidents.\nImprovements made in relation to signage and road markings outside Overton Grange school due to concerns about road safety when students leave the school at the end of the day. A new, flashing “wig wag” sign (it flashes when switched on at about the time students arrive at or leave school) erected.\nThis is the “wig wag” sign.\nExpansion of Devonshire Avenue, The Avenue and Barrow Hedges primary schools will make it easier for Sutton South parents to get their children into these excellent, popular and frequently over-subscribed schools. We also succeeded in moving the polling stations from Devonshire and Barrow Hedges schools to local church halls, so the education of the children will not be disrupted for a day and related child care problems can be avoided.\nExtension of the “No Drinking Zone” into Sutton South Ward, to deal with issues of anti-social behaviour associated with a group of “all day drinkers” who tend to congregate on the corner of Cedar Road and Brighton road, the location shown in this picture.\nRepresentations made by your local Liberal Democrat Councillors to contribute to Sutton-wide response to Transport for London consultation on the future of the X26 Croydon to Heathrow service, the 80 service from Sutton station to Belmont and the 280 Tooting to Belmont service, to stress the importance to local people of these services.\nSupport for the creation of more “car club” bays in Sutton South Ward, such as this bay in Albion Road which was identified for conversion to a “car club” bay, in order to encourage better car use, reducing pollution, a “greener” Borough and policy on sustainable transport. This proposal is currently on hold but Car2go have expanded their car club service in the Ward.\nNew street trees planted, such as this one in Copse Hill. And in Copse Hill we also intervened to get Council officials to look at the potential for a flooding problem at the foot of the hill, with the cleaning out of the soakaways and other improvements.\nAction to improve the Devonshire Avenue Nature Area, involving, amongst other things, re-positioning the benches, partially removing a wall that divides up the site, possibly fencing some areas with low wooden fencing to protect the kidney vetch essential for the small blue buterfly, removing the corrugated iron sheeting found at the site and installing a small piece of play equipment for children aged 5 to 7 at the entrance, while taking action to control the habitat. The reserve is the only open space in the Ward. We have supported only limited installation of play equipment as we believe the area should continue to be a nature reserve, and our proposals are designed to ensure the habitat of the area will not be harmed. We are promoting a programme to assist the small blue butterfly.\nAction to improve the safety of pedestrians who pass under the railway bridge in Grange Vale. There is a narrow pavement and, as it is a one-way street, cars roar round the corner from the Brighton Road end and under the bridge, the driver only seeing a pedestrian on the pavement under the bridge at the last moment. This is a particular problem for parents with buggies or with small children passing under the bridge against the direction of traffic. A barrier and set of posts have been erected to slow the traffic.\nThis photo shows the improvement made.\nAction taken to discuss with BT the installation of the new generation of very large green cabinets at locations in the Ward, to ensure they are put in locations that do not cause annoyance to residents, as this box in Cedar Road does. Action to prevent the boxes being covered with unsightly advertising.\nAction to promote the sensitive re-development of Sutherland House, which is currently an eyesore, and to ensure that if it is re-developed there will be gains for the residents of the Ward through a programme of improvements funded by the developer, through the community infrastructure levy and section 106 contributions.\nAction to get the Edwardian tennis pavilion in Mayfield Road included on the Sutton Local List as a building of significant local historical importance and interest.\nCampaign launched to stop Thameslink services being terminated at Blackfriars, something that would lead to dispersion of commuters onto other services that are already packed, cut Sutton off from St. Pancras International and north London, and harm the attractiveness of Sutton to companies locating their offices away from but close to central London.\nA programe of road maintenence throughout the Ward – this picture shows line painting in Eaton Road.\nThe side entrance at Sutton station\nOur campaign continues to get the side entrance to Sutton station opened. A bid submitted by Sutton Council for funding from the Mayor’s Outer London Fund was not successful, but the campaign continues and a further bid (to TfL) has been successful. This is not the end of the story as negotiations continue on matched funding..\nWe succeeded in getting the date for the four-yearly pruning of the thousand or so street trees in Sutton South Ward brought forward to the end of 2011.

It is one of 18 stations in London identified by TfL as suffering significant congestion problems.\nThe main elements in the scheme would not only include opening the side entrance but extensive landscaping to improve the appearance of what would in effect be a new entrance from The Quadrant. The main elements include:\n* Opening up the side entrance to the station to improve station access and egress, improve the streetscape and improve pedestrian access to the station\n* Public realm and footway improvements in The Quadrant and at the front of the station\n* Bus stop improvements at the front of the station to improve passenger experience\n* “De-cluttering” and harmonisation of street furniture and materials\n* Junction and crossing improvements on walking routes to the station\n* Road safety improvements\n* Additional cycle parking and cycle lanes, and\n* Improved street lighting.\nBenefits of the scheme will include reduced pedestrian journey times between the station and The Quadrant, the station car park and the Langley Park Road area, as well as reduced congestion within the station main entrance and at the barriers.\nOpening the side entrance at Sutton Station would cater for the considerable demand for direct access to the station from the Quadrant House office block, which houses Reed Business Information (with approximately 2,000 employees, about one third of whom travel to work by train) and a number of other expanding companies, together with Tudor Court office block, which houses Synergy UK. The new entrance would also serve the large station car park (which Network Rail wish to expand), and the motorcycle and cycle parking areas, which generate considerable demand for access from that side of the station. There is also direct footpath access between The Quadrant and Langley Park Road and surrounding residential streets, well-used by rail passengers. These station users currently have to walk around the side to the front of the station on a convoluted route and negotiate busy footways, bus stops and the station entrance. Most of these passengers are likely to have season tickets, and opening up the side entrance would significantly reduce their journey times and congestion outside and in the entrance hall of the main station entrance.\nThe Council has been lobbying for the opening up of the side entrance since it was created over ten years ago with a retractable shutter. The entrance is opened up when rail replacement buses are used during engineering work, as the buses stop in The Quadrant. This demonstrates that it is possible to open up and allow passengers to use this entrance in principle. Southern support the opening in principle, subject to funding being available to provide the barriers etc. Network Rail also supports the scheme in principle and has assisted with initial business case work.\nWe will keep you advised of progress.",

The two most challenging pieces of work I did were the re-design of the Council tax support scheme and the re-design of the Council’s committee system.\nThe Government “localised” Council tax support (the system of support payments to the most needy) by axing the national scheme. It invited local authorities to set up their own scheme but passed down to Councils only some of the funding. This cost Sutton £1.1 million. The challenge was to devise a local scheme which, while inevitably less generous, protected the vulnerable. The scheme I devised, which was ultimately accepted, provided support to those in most need and protected from cuts in benefit the elderly, the disabled, lone parents and families with small children. There were difficult choices and it was one of the most difficult projects I have undertaken in 40 years work in public administration.\nThe revision of the Council’s committee system I worked on was designed to take advantage of provisions in the Localism Act that made it possible to move from an “Executive” system to a “subject committee” system I considered more democratic. I led the group considering options and developed a scheme that was the basis for the system Sutton now has adopted.\nI also did a lot of work on a scrutiny of the Council’s policies on homelessness. This issue concerned me as I felt that some of the policies being recommended to us by Conservative Councillors would have increased homelessness, and the scrutiny activity demonstrated this.\nI have also been a member of the Audit Committee, the Scrutiny Committee, the Standards Committee, the Development Control Committee and the representative of Sutton on numerous external bodies and boards, such as the Downland Project (which organises volunteers to, for example, clear scrubland in local woods).\nWhen I was elected I obtained an exercise book (I do not trust computerised systems) and wrote on the cover “Casework.” Item number one was an issue raised by a resident of Copse Hill about a tree in the road demolished by a car. I got it replaced. My most recent entry in the Casework book (a disputed parking ticket I got rescinded) is item number 413, but this does not quite do me justice as some of these entries are multiple issues and some issues I was able to resolve almost immediately without resort to the “Casework” book.\nThere are some issues affecting the Ward as a whole that I have worked on that give me particular satisfaction – including the extension of the “no drinking zone” (controlling the drinking of alcohol in a public place) from the town centre to cover most of the Ward, the improvements to the Devonshire Avenue Nature Area while retaining its central purpose as a nature reserve, the safety improvements to the Grange Vale bridge, opening the side entrance to Sutton station (work now underway), getting more trees planted, helping found the Sutton South Hello! Project to tackle social isolation, getting funding for measures to combat speeding in Cavendish Road and Cedar Road, and securing 780 local jobs through the Subsea7 project (jobs are gold dust). The regular surgeries we have held have convinced me that there is a real issue for people in their 50s made redundant from work in getting back into the labour market, and the really big difference you can make to an area is ensuring there are local jobs. There are very few Councillors in Britain who can claim they have been instrumental in getting so many jobs for their area, given the massive competition between local authorities for such job-creating inward investment.\nThere were also many things I did for individual residents. Some of these projects gave me great satisfaction – such as getting a disabled parking bay moved so that it was not under a tree and thus the disabled resident did not get her car covered, every day, with droppings. For another resident, I got her over £2 000 in a compensation payment through pursuing her case. Some of the issues I dealt with, particularly those involving anti-social behaviour, were difficult and sometimes harrowing.\nThe background I brought to my period as a Councillor was that I am a retired civil servant who was, at one time, Chair of the Board of a European Agency (the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, based in Bilbao, Spain) and at another time Chair of the Channel Tunnel Safety Authority. After a long career in public service at a European and national level it was a priviledge and a pleasure to use the skills I had obtained, in the service of my immediate, local community. My wife Gloria and I have lived in our Ward for 26 years and both our daughters went to local State schools. I like Sutton, which has a pleasant suburban atmosphere, low crime, good schools, affordable housing and low unemployment. I have been motivated by a desire to play my part in keeping its many benefits. And the values I bring to being a Councillor are those of a concern to use the skills I have acquired in life to benefit the disadvantaged in society – in society as a whole and, in my work these past four years, in the immediate community around me. And I have still managed to find time to play the trumpet in a Sutton-based concert band, playing last year in a concert at Christchurch for the 125th. anniversary of the church, and playing Christmas carols at the Friends’ Meeting House for the past two years.\nThere has been hardly a day in the last four years when I have not been engaged on some activity on behalf of the residents of Sutton.\nRICHARD CLIFTON",

Richard said, in a letter to residents, “I am increasingly concerned that people are turning to these companies without looking into the real costs of borrowing money, which in some cases that I have investigated are well over 1000% APR.”\nThis was among the principal conclusions he drew when he spoke to the Council’s Housing, Economy and Business Committee about the latest data on Sutton’s economic performance. He pointed out that, amongst the generally positive data on economic development in Sutton, enquiries to Sutton’s Citizens Advice Bureau were up by about 5% in the last quarter with debt enquiries increasing by 8.8%. There has to be a fear that recent welfare cuts will make the position worse.\nIn a letter to residents he called for consideration to be given to establishing by law some upper limit on the interest rate that can be charged on loans.\nRichard said “I have said my piece, at Sutton Council meetings, about the problem of loan sharks and “payday” loans, and I cannot see why it is impossible to have a maximum figure for the interest charged on these loans (it can be well over 1000% APR) imposed in law.”\nAs long ago as 9 May 2011 Richard made a speech to a Sutton Council meeting calling for an end to illegal loan sharking, drawing attention to loan offers he had found on the Internet where the APR was over 1000%.\nHis comments come in the same week that Newcastle United hit the headlines over the sponsorship of their football kit by a “Payday Loans” company and evidence was published of an increase in this type of lending. He was commenting on a paper “Economy Watch – Economic Indicators Report” presented to the Council’s Housing, Economy and Business Committee, of which he is vice-chair.

They can still sign up and make the required payment, either online by visiting\nor by returning the form received in the post to the Council.\nA 240 litre bin will be charged at £59 annually with an early bird discount rate of £49 offered to people who signed up before the 15th February 2015. That’s cheaper than neighbouring boroughs of Kingston (£71), Merton (£65) and Richmond (£60). This decision was taken by the Environment and Neighbourhood’s Committee after almost 2,000 people had their say on the future of the service. The consultation was part of the Council’s “Sutton’s Future” campaign which encourages residents to help the Council achieve £40m of savings from its annual budget by 2019. The savings are being forced by unprecedented government reductions to funding and growing demand for Council services.\nResidents were given the option of the current free service becoming a charged for service, or being stopped completely. The paid for service will start on 1 July, 2015. The Borough-wide consultation included a telephone survey representative of the Borough, an online survey on the Sutton’s Future website and three ‘Have Your Say’ events where residents could give their views in person and ask questions. In the telephone survey, 79% of those surveyed had a garden and 74% of these used the current service. Out of the 1,002 people surveyed, 32% were in favour of charging for the service and 42% supported it being stopped. In the online survey, out of the 892 people that took part, 69% favoured the chargeable service and 60% said they intended to subscribe, while 11% said they supported the service stopping. In the three ‘Have Your Say’ events, the preferred option among the 92 attendees was to charge for the service.",

There are many blocks of flats in the Ward and recently there have been a small number of incidents reported to us of rough sleepers spending the night in stairwells.\nThe problem of homelessness has, of course, increased recently due to Government housing policies. We have been involved in discussions with housing managers and the police about precautions such as entryphone systems and sought to help local groups that are trying to deal with the problem of homelessness and rough sleeping. If you observe rough sleepers in stairwells it is best to contact the police on the non-emergency 101 number. They can also be directed to sources of advice such as the Salvation Army (02086429862), Shelter (02034686293) and the Sutton Civic offices (02087705800).",

A resident suggested this was about the point where someone walking back from the station with a takeaway snack would finish it and drop rubbish.\nRe-surfacing of Hillcroome Road to deal with potholes after the hard winter of 2009/2010.\nImprovements to the layout of the Brighton Road at the junction with Ventnor Road and Devonshire Avenue, to reduce road accidents.\nImprovements made in relation to signage and road markings outside Overton Grange school due to concerns about road safety when students leave the school at the end of the day. A new, flashing “wig wag” sign (it flashes when switched on at about the time students arrive at or leave school) erected.\nThis is the “wig wag” sign.\nExpansion of Devonshire Avenue, The Avenue and Barrow Hedges primary schools will make it easier for Sutton South parents to get their children into these excellent, popular and frequently over-subscribed schools. We also succeeded in moving the polling stations from Devonshire and Barrow Hedges schools to local church halls, so the education of the children will not be disrupted for a day and related child care problems can be avoided.\nExtension of the “No Drinking Zone” into Sutton South Ward, to deal with issues of anti-social behaviour associated with a group of “all day drinkers” who tend to congregate on the corner of Cedar Road and Brighton road, the location shown in this picture.\nRepresentations made by your local Liberal Democrat Councillors to contribute to Sutton-wide response to Transport for London consultation on the future of the X26 Croydon to Heathrow service, the 80 service from Sutton station to Belmont and the 280 Tooting to Belmont service, to stress the importance to local people of these services.\nSupport for the creation of more “car club” bays in Sutton South Ward, such as this bay in Albion Road which was identified for conversion to a “car club” bay, in order to encourage better car use, reducing pollution, a “greener” Borough and policy on sustainable transport. This proposal is currently on hold but Car2go have expanded their car club service in the Ward.\nNew street trees planted, such as this one in Copse Hill. And in Copse Hill we also intervened to get Council officials to look at the potential for a flooding problem at the foot of the hill, with the cleaning out of the soakaways and other improvements.\nAction to improve the Devonshire Avenue Nature Area, involving, amongst other things, re-positioning the benches, partially removing a wall that divides up the site, possibly fencing some areas with low wooden fencing to protect the kidney vetch essential for the small blue buterfly, removing the corrugated iron sheeting found at the site and installing a small piece of play equipment for children aged 5 to 7 at the entrance, while taking action to control the habitat. The reserve is the only open space in the Ward. We have supported only limited installation of play equipment as we believe the area should continue to be a nature reserve, and our proposals are designed to ensure the habitat of the area will not be harmed. We are promoting a programme to assist the small blue butterfly.\nAction to improve the safety of pedestrians who pass under the railway bridge in Grange Vale. There is a narrow pavement and, as it is a one-way street, cars roar round the corner from the Brighton Road end and under the bridge, the driver only seeing a pedestrian on the pavement under the bridge at the last moment. This is a particular problem for parents with buggies or with small children passing under the bridge against the direction of traffic. A barrier and set of posts have been erected to slow the traffic.\nThis photo shows the improvement made.\nAction taken to discuss with BT the installation of the new generation of very large green cabinets at locations in the Ward, to ensure they are put in locations that do not cause annoyance to residents, as this box in Cedar Road does. Action to prevent the boxes being covered with unsightly advertising.\nAction to promote the sensitive re-development of Sutherland House, which is currently an eyesore, and to ensure that if it is re-developed there will be gains for the residents of the Ward through a programme of improvements funded by the developer, through the community infrastructure levy and section 106 contributions.\nAction to get the Edwardian tennis pavilion in Mayfield Road included on the Sutton Local List as a building of significant local historical importance and interest.\nCampaign launched to stop Thameslink services being terminated at Blackfriars, something that would lead to dispersion of commuters onto other services that are already packed, cut Sutton off from St. Pancras International and north London, and harm the attractiveness of Sutton to companies locating their offices away from but close to central London.\nA programe of road maintenence throughout the Ward – this picture shows line painting in Eaton Road.\nOur campaign continues to get the side entrance to Sutton station opened. A bid submitted by Sutton Council for funding from the Mayor’s Outer London Fund was not successful, but the campaign continues and a further bid (to TfL) has been successful. This is not the end of the story as negotiations continue on matched funding..\nWe succeeded in getting the date for the four-yearly pruning of the thousand or so street trees in Sutton South Ward brought forward to the end of 2011. We have also got commitment to an interim look at the state of the trees, outside the normal four year cycle, in 2014.\nIt’s really a nice and helpful piece of information. I’m glad that you shared this helpful info with us. Please keep us informed like this. Thanks for sharing.",

Severe weather and footfall leads to the inevitable weathering of carriageways and pavements. The Council’s programme for re-surfacing roads and pavements has been under pressure over recent years due to austerity and the cuts in local authority funding. We are pleased that the programme for the coming year includes the re-surfacing of the footway and the replacement of concrete light columns in a number of roads in our Ward.\nTrish and Richard report potholes and damage reported to us by residents or that we observe, to supplement the Council’s programme of inspection and maintenance of carriageways and footways. Please make sure you let us know of problems that need fixing. In the last few years the pavement in Mayfield Road has been resurfaced, and The Ridgway is in the programme for the coming year. The work has started in The Ridgway (see the photos below). The lighting column replacement programme for the next year will cover a number of local roads where the lighting needs to be upgraded, including Effingham Close, Grange Vale, Overton Road, Summers Close, Ventnor Road and Westmoreland Drive. Let us know of other candidates and any roads where there are “dark patches” with inadequate street lighting. And let us know immediately of street lights that have failed as we usually get these fixed quite quickly.",

In September Trish made an impassioned speech to Sutton Council on the problems residents have experienced, quoting the stories residents have shared with us of cancelled services and broken down trains.

  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_category_environment_page_3/content_213.html": "Transport for London is consulting on proposals for a new, direct and fast public transport link service for Sutton and Merton. This consultation is called the Sutton Link and seeks views on bringing the tram to Sutton, or developing what is called a new Bus Rapid Transport (BRT) route. You can respond to the consultation at\nhttp://www.tfl.gov.uk/sutton-link\nCouncillor Whitehead, the Chair of Sutton Council’s transport liaison committee, and Sutton Council officers will be meeting with TfL London Buses in the New Year to discuss how bus services can be tailored to meet future development proposals in the borough. It will also provide an opportunity to raise any issues related to any shortcomings with existing services. A similar meeting has been held in previous years but Councillor Whitehead tells us a more thorough review of outer London services is now promised by TfL.\nThis is an opportunity to set out views on any changes we would like to see made to services in the area, including changes to frequencies or the duration of services, or route diversions/extensions to provide missing connections.\nOfficers will consider how this information is presented to TfL. However, the final decision on any such changes rests with TfL and there will be limited resources available.\nLocal residents in Sutton South Ward have raised with us the following concerns when consulted in the recent past.\nRoute frequency – although residents have commented that on some routes, such as route 80, frequency and reliability is good, bus 470 is seen as too infrequent, being only about every half hour.\nSimilarly, route S4 could be more frequent.\nA further difficulty with the 470 is that it does not run on a Sunday so our suggestions for the 470 are to increase the frequency from once every half an hour, run it on Sundays and (see below) extend it to Epsom hospital.\nThe X26 bus to Heathrow is used by many and the increased frequency of the X26 is welcome, but the buses have difficulty in keeping to the timetable, perhaps because of the length of the route. Some residents say they would not use it if travelling to Heathrow to catch a plane as it is not 100% reliable. There may thus be a case for increasing the frequency further.\nRoute length – could the 470 go to Epsom hospital rather than Epsom market as there are residents who use it to go to the hospital?\nOn route 151, the frequency and reliability is generally good but the service could be improved if some rush hour buses turned round at North Cheam, bearing in mind that the 213 duplicates the 151 onwards to Worcester Park.\nTimetabling – it is noted that the 80 and 280 buses running northwards along Brighton Road frequently arrive at the same time. Could the timetabling be looked at?\nPassenger information – it has been pointed out that the two bus stops in Mulgrave Road close to Sutton station do not include digital displays on bus arrival information. Although there are other ways of getting this information, on your mobile phone, not all passengers have the skill to get this.\nA review of the information arrangements was suggested for some routes. On route 164, at some stops the bus is recorded as a minute away or due but it does not turn up for six or seven minutes.\nOther matters – There has often been comment on arrangements at Sutton station. A resident suggested that congestion in Mulgrave Roadcould be alleviated by moving the taxi rank. It would be possible to move it to The Quadrant now the side entrance to the station is open, but this would probably be unpopular with the taxi drivers and railway passengers, and was not a proposal pursued under the Sutton Gateway project. A resident also commented that this part of Mulgrave Road has on occasions been briefly flooded during very heavy downpours. I have asked Council engineers to investigate.\nA summary of these comments, by bus route, is:\n470 – increase the frequency from once every half an hour, run it on Sundays and extend it to Epsom hospital\n151 – the service could be improved if some rush hour buses turned round at North Cheam, bearing in mind that the 213 duplicates the 151 onwards to Worcester Park\n80 and 280 – buses running northwards along Brighton Road frequently arrive at the same time so review the timetabling\n164 – review the information arrangements as at some stops the bus is recorded as a minute away or due but it does not turn up for six or seven minutes\nS1 – review the way the timetable is set out on the website\nS4 – review the frequency.\nIt should be noted that while this summary is focussed on suggesting improvements, many residents have commented to us in favourable terms on the frequency and reliability of local bus services.\nWe have put this digest of views forward to officers for consideration. Any decision rests, of course, with Transport for London.",
  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_category_news_page_17/content_673.html": "WELCOMING RABBI SHMULI SAGAL\nThere are three places of worship in our Ward – Christchurch in Christchurch Park is a Victorian Church of England church while in Cedar Road there is the Friends Meeting House and the Sutton and District United Synagoge.\nOn 11 September Richard attended the induction service to induct Rabbi Shmuli Sagal at the Sutton and District United synagogue in Cedar Road. Rabbi Shmuli Sagal studied in Israel and the USA, as well as the UK, in completing his studies prior to his appointment. The service was attended by the Chief Rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, both Sutton and Carshalton Members of Parliament, and the Leader of Sutton Council, Councillor Ruth Dombey. It coincided with the 70th anniversary of the founding of the synagogue and was celebrated by the dedication a set of renovated Torah Scrolls.\nPROGRESS ON TRAFFIC AND PARKING SCHEMES IN THE WARD\nThere is further progress on the traffic and parking schemes under consideration for the Ward to report following the meeting of the South Sutton, Cheam and Belmont Local Committee held on 8 September 2016 and the discussion at the Environment and Neighbourhoods Committee on 15 September of a global strategy for parking. To ensure a consistent approach throughout the Borough, all local schemes will be drawn into a central strategy and progressed on the basis of an assessment of priorities.\nAn ambitious scheme for the introduction of a 20mph scheme across most of the area of Sutton South Ward west of the Sutton to Belmont railway line has now been included in the “Local Implementation Plan” prepared by Transport for London. This was the subject of proposals put to the local committee in 2015. However, it is on the “reserve list” which means that implementation in the near future is most unlikely.\nA parking scheme for the newly-named Berridge Close is agreed, implementation to coincide with the opening of the adjacent Subsea7 building, as this will lead to more intensive use of the road by those working in the building and accessing the underground car park. Obstructive parking in Berridge Close could lead to problems when the building is occupied, so needs to be avoided. It is proposed that the road will be included in the controlled parking zone with four parking bays in the road, reserved for residents with parking permits. Completion of the building is unlikely before December.\nTraffic and parking schemes were the subject of a session at the December 2015 meeting of the South Sutton, Cheam and Belmont Local Committee, when residents noted down parking and traffic problems. A list of the proposals raised by residents was reported back to the local committee meeting on 10 March.\nIn relation to our own area, the proposals fell into three main categories.\nFirst, concerns about intensive and sometimes obstructive parking in Mayfield Road and roads nearby (The Ridgway, Chalgrove Road, Upland Road).\nSecond, concerns about visibility at the Farm Road / The Ridgway junction.\nThird, a set of other concerns, mostly about speeding at various locations.\nThis listing will form the agenda for further work by the traffic department within a wider cross-Borough study, which is centrally managed by the Council. A number of minor, initial proposals were agreed on 10 March, including to restrict parking at the Prior Avenue / Banstead Road junction due to visibility issues.\nThe question of a parking control scheme in Mayfield Road and the surrounding area was the subject of a consultation exercise by local Councillors last year which showed support in Mayfield Road but not adjacent roads. On 10 March the local committee agreed to devote some of its public realm funds to fund the traffic department to “kick start” a study of potential for parking controls in this area. A discussion between traffic engineers and Ward Councillors to consider this study was held on 8 June in Mayfield Road. The traffic engineers will design a parking control scheme for consultation. The precise parameters of this scheme and the consultation have yet to be finalised. Consultation with residents is due to begin in January 2017.\nSome residents of Audley Place have commented to us that there is difficulty when driving out of Audley Place in seeing vehicles coming down Camborne Road, if cars are parked close to the corner. We raised this issue with traffic engineers and the Council is proposing a small extension of the yellow lines on each side at the exit from Audley Place. We think this will do the trick in terms of making it easier, and safer, to drive out into Camborne Road.\nResidents of Tapestry Close have complained to us about obstructive parking in the Close. We raised this issue with traffic engineers and a scheme of yellow lining was proposed. Further consultation with residents, required by law, found some residents objecting and this scheme is currently on hold.\nSeveral schemes consulted on some time ago have now been implemented, including yellow lining at the bottom of Downside Road to deal with obstructive parking (see photo above) and switching some “pay and display” bays to “dual use” so residents with parking permits can use them, in Grange Road and Langley Park Road.\nA CRICKET BALL ROLLS IN SUTTON\nOn 16 August Richard, in his capacity as the Mayor of Sutton, together with the chief of Sutton’s police service, Chief Superintendent Stringer, gave enthusiastic support to the teams from Sutton police and the local Muslim community who met for their annual cricket match at Purley cricket ground.\nWEEKLY COLLECTION OF FOOD WASTE PROPOSED\nProposals for a new waste collection service include a weekly collection of food waste.\nThere will continue to be fortnightly collection of re-cycling waste. The waste that currently goes in the brown bin will be divided, with the food waste collected weekly and other waste collected fortnightly. At present around 40 per cent of brown-bin waste is food waste, so this will mean residents will be able to reduce significantly the amount of waste in their brown bins. These changes will mean less waste goes to landfill, which is good for the environment.\nGarden waste collections for paying residents will be extended from nine months a year to all year round. This will be collected in the same green and brown wheelie bin.\nStreet cleaning operations will be extended to 10pm from the current 6.30am start.\nThe new contracts will enable Sutton Council to save £10.3m over the first eight years. It is estimated that Sutton’s recycling rate will increase from 37 per cent (2014/15) to 42 per cent by the end of the first year of the contract.\nSutton Council has agreed to the shared service approach with its neighbours due to the unprecedented Government cuts to the Council’s budget, along with the opportunities to increase recycling rates. Currently Sutton has to save £31m from its annual budget due to Government cuts. The Council’s annual budget is £148.4m.\nAMNA AHMAD TO FIGHT SUTTON IF SNAP ELECTION CALLED\nAmna Ahmad has been selected overwhelmingly as the Liberal Democrat parliamentary candidate for Sutton and Cheam, ready to fight the seat if a snap election is called in the autumn. The Liberal Democrats are now ready to fight a General Election, having selected candidates in areas with a proud liberal tradition, such as Sutton and Cheam.\nThis follows reports that the new Prime Minister might go to the country early, before a possible recession and to take advantage of Labour in-fighting.\nAs the former London Assembly candidate for Sutton, Amna has a strong record of fighting for people, having campaigned for better trains, half price fares and more affordable housing for local residents.\nAmna Ahmad said: “I am really proud to have been selected. It would be a huge honour to represent this wonderful area.\n“I am well aware that Sutton, Cheam & Worcester Park does have its challenges. As such my three campaign priorities will be to improve train services, provide more school places for local families and protect local health services.\n“Nationally the country is in crisis. Both the Conservatives and Labour are focused entirely on in-fighting while the economy worsens, threatening jobs, public services and our efforts to build the houses Britain so badly needs.\n“The Liberal Democrats are well placed to fight a general election whenever it is held and I am raring to build on our local tradition of delivering for local people. Since the referendum we have signed more than 17,500 new members nationally including a large number in Sutton.\n“The Conservatives have destroyed their reputation for economic competence, with investment plummeting, putting Sutton jobs at risk. Their vicious cuts to local government are putting a strain on our community services. Labour has given up even trying to speak to the British people, and is engaged in a vicious fight with itself. We, meanwhile, are selecting candidates in key seats.\n“Only the Liberal Democrats are an open, optimistic and united party committed to spreading opportunity for the next generation and focus on re-building the British economy to protect jobs and services.”\nSUTTON SOUTH HELLO’S SUCCESSFUL GARDEN PARTY\nOn 20 July we attended the Sutton South Hello annual garden party, held in the garden of Nancy, in Chalgrove Road. About 50 residents attended. There was good weather and music, and a good time was had by all.\nSutton South Hello, a social club for the elderly and those seeking friendship, is the result of collaboration between local Councillors, associations, residents, churches, our Sutton South Safer Neighbourhood police team and voluntary organisations like Age UK Sutton and SKILL (Sutton Centre for Independent Living). Heather Honour, former Liberal Democrat Councillor, chairs the Board and has worked hard to involve all aspects of the community in the project. Richard is a trustee of Hello, sits on the committee and was amongst those who helped found it.\nIt was launched at Christchurch, in Christchurch Park, on 9 May 2012 by the then Care Minister, Liberal Democrat MP Norman Lamb, and was the pilot for similar initiatives elsewhere in the Borough.\nLOCAL POLICE PRIORITIES ASSESSED\nOn 12 July Trish and Richard attended the police consultative group meeting for Sutton South Ward, held in the church hall at Christchurch. It is a pity these public meetings attract so few members of the public, only four tonight. The police priorities for the next quarter will include seeking Neighbourhood Watch co-ordinators at Farm Close and Audley Place, and tackling the problem of rough sleepers in Ambleside Gardens and Beauclere House, in Brighton Road. There was also discussion of the theft of bins at blocks of flats in Brighton Road and in Christchurch Park. The overall level of crime in the area remains low.\nThe police are very keen to monitor any community tensions that might have arisen as a result of the EU referendum. Emotions may run high for a while and there have been some reports in the national media about a rise in hate crime and harassment in some areas. We have not heard of any such incidents locally; but obviously the police rely very much upon the community and the Neighbourhood Watch to monitor things like this for them.\nIf you have detected any such issues – or know of anyone who has – please do not hesitate to contact Sutton police to report them.\nIf anyone wishes to make an anonymous report they can always call Crimestoppers at any time – day or night – on 0800 555 111, in complete confidence.\nOn 6 July Richard, by invitation, attended the Eid celebrations held annually in Overton Park (see picture above) at the end of Ramadan, to show his support for multculturalism and opposition to hate crime.\nCllr Ruth Dombey, Leader of Sutton Council, Niall Bolger, Chief Executive of Sutton Council, Cllr Tim Crowley, Leader of the Opposition at Sutton Council, and Sutton Borough Police Commander Dave Stringer said in a joint statement on 30 June:\n“Since the EU referendum result there have been media reports of hate crimes against people living in this country. However, there has been no increase in hate crime incidents reported to the police in Sutton and across London.\n“We are grateful that Sutton has not seen an increase in such intolerant and antisocial behaviour. The vote is not a licence for racist and xenophobic behaviour. We would urge residents to be vigilant to ensure that all borough citizens continue to live together in a peaceful, harmonious and responsible way.\n“We are aware that certain events can spur intolerance, hate or extremism. Anyone who witnesses or suffers any hate incident of any type should report it immediately to the Police so that they can take action and deal with any incidents quickly.\n“Sutton is a popular place to live, in part because we are a tolerant, open society that values people of all cultures, nationalities and religions. At this time it is more important than ever that we show solidarity with our neighbours of all different faith and cultural groups to ensure that extremist views and behaviour have no part of our community.”\nHONOURING OUR ARMED FORCES\nOn 20 June Trish and Richard attended the flag raising ceremony, raising the Armed Forces Day flag in Sutton Town Square, to honour our armed services. This marked the start of Armed Forces Week. Richard, as Mayor, led the event.\nRichard said “Our Armed Forces are busy working around the world, promoting peace, delivering aid, tackling drug smugglers, tackling people smugglers, providing security, fighting terrorism. They work in difficult, dangerous and unpleasant conditions away from their families and the luxuries we all take for granted. They operate in environments where the very basics of security and safety are absent. They face, daily, a daunting challenge, doing work that is vital to the protection of our society and our way of life. we now watch with pride as the Armed Forces Day flag is raised for those who are currently serving and those who have served.”\nOn 25 June Richard visited the army centre in Stonecot Hill (see photo) and observed the work of 151 Logistics Corps. On 20 July he attended a reception given by 151 Logistics Corps at which there was stirring rendition of “Highland Cathedral” (a composition popular with the concert bands Richard plays with) by the Ghurka pipe and drum band.\nA BUSY WEEKEND FOR THE MAYOR\nThe weekend of June 11 and 12 was incredibly full for Richard and Gloria, in their roles as Mayor and Mayoress. On Saturday Richard and Gloria attended the Carshalton Carnival, the picture showing them with the Carnival Queen and her attendants. Richard then opened the St Helier Festival, after which he played the trumpet with the Phoenix Concert Band at a concert during the afternoon tea for senior citizens at the Friends’ Meeting House in Cedar Road.\nOn Sunday there were many street parties, including one in Cumnor Road, to celebrate the Queen’s birthday.\n[ Further and regular updates on Richard and Gloria’s Mayoral activities can be found on “Richard’s Blog” – go back to the top to find the link to click on. ]",

This is very slightly down on the figures for the previous two months, with the peak figure being in April (£ 246 935). Rising house prices are taken to be a sign of buoyancy in the local economy, though Sutton remains an area of London that has a comparably large amount of housing that people can afford.\nOther indicators paint a varied picture, but with most showing that Sutton is surviving the recession well.\nFor example:\nThe unemployment rate in Sutton, measured by the proportion of the working age population claiming Job Seekers Allowance, is 2.7% compared to a London average of 4.1%.\nThe economic activity rate (percentage of the working age population that is economically active) is 78.3%, above the London average of 75.1%.\nThe number of unfilled job vacancies locally is over 50% higher than a year ago, an indicator of strong local growth, though at 869 vacancies are well below the numbers unemployed (3391 claiming JSA).\nThe percentage of empty properties, Borough wide, is over 1% down on the figure for a year ago.\nSutton will be bolstered by the decision of businesses in the town centre to vote in favour of the establishment of a Business Improvement District, which will bring more money into Sutton town centre. This will support the Council’s “Opportunity Sutton” programme to attract inward investment, promoting Sutton as one of the few metropolitan centres in south London with a skilled workforce, available industrial and office sites, good transport links, a pleasant suburban environment and low crime.\nRichard drew attention to a firm he had visited in Sutton South Ward, Synergy UK, that has been very successful as a recruitment and training adviser. The firm has grown from nothing to employ over 40 people locally, in just a few years. Aside from providing a service to its clients it takes young people from unemployment into training, providing a City and Guilds qualification in social care work, and finds them jobs.\nRichard said “I believe Sutton has great strengths. It is a good place to live and people locally are finding work, despite the recession.”",

It was held at Overton Grange school, in Sutton South Ward, the first time the Council has met in our Ward, This follows a decision by Council to get out and about round the Borough, to see the Borough and be seen, rather than sit in the Council offices.\nThe main debate was on the subject of single use plastics, on which Trish made an impassioned speech drawing attention to the plight of the oceans anc calling for greater responsibility worldwide. Richard took the opportunity of a debate on the Council’s plan to welcome Councillors to Sutton South. He said:\n“We are now doing something we perhaps should have done before and getting out round the Borough, to see different parts of the Borough and be seen there. And tonight we are starting that process by meeting in Sutton South Ward. So I think it appropriate for me as a Councillor for Sutton South to welcome you all to Sutton South. I know my fellow Sutton South Councillor Councillor Fivey wants to join me in extending this welcome, to Sutton South which is famous for:\nA low level of crime, one of the lowest for any Ward in the 32 London Boroughs\nExcellent schools, our local schools are brilliant\nA unique environmental facility in the Devonshire Avenue Nature Area\nA green, pleasant, suburban environment\nAnd a relatively high level of employment, contributed to by our success in persuading a major transnational company in the oil exploration business – Subsea 7 – to locate their global, international headquarters in the Ward, bringing 900 jobs, some – not just in more routine occupations – now being occupied by local people, with 900 staff spending money in local shops and restaurants, and boosting the local economy.\nI relate this to the important entry in the plan on page 17 reading\n“Implementation of the Local Plan to deliver retail, office and industrial development and employment opportunities”\nWe have done that in Sutton South – we will continue to do it.”",

Trish continues a s a member of the Housing, Economy and Business Committee, is elected to the Standards Committee, and will sit on the Merton and Sutton Joint Cemetery Board. Richard stands down as chair of Planning Committee and is elected Mayor for the next year.\nHere is the text of Richard’s acceptance speech.\n“I have during the six years that I have been a member of this Council served under five Mayors, three of whom are currently members of the Council. All of them did the job with great distinction. Gloria and I will do our best to continue in that tradition.\nI have many people to thank, but can I particularly thank our musicians. My good friends John, George, Rachel, Stephen and Andrew. When I was first elected to the Council there was a tradition of having some music during the natural interval that occurs in the middle of these annual meetings. It somehow lapsed but I was determined to revive it with – of course – brass musical instruments.\nLast year there was a review of the functions of the Mayor. The review report noted the long tradition in the cities, towns and boroughs of our country of the office of a Mayor, and in London the history can be traced back to 1189. But the report included proposals to bring the Mayor of Sutton into the 21st. century by promoting the Mayor through, and I quote the report, “twitter, facebook and a Mayoral blog on the Council’s website.” I hope this will become required reading for all of you and I will try to find something interesting or amusing to say each week, and you can give me marks out of ten.\nOf course, these different Mayors, stretching back to 1189, had a wide variety of ceremonial and policy functions. The promotion of charities to aid those less fortunate in life is however a recurring theme throughout, and a role of the Mayor that continues, which brings me to the subject of charities. I am pleased to be able to tell you of the two charities I propose we support this year.\nThese are Sutton Shopmobility and the Altzheimer’s Society. The Altzheimer’s society has a strong presence in Sutton and the Council has worked hard on the theme of being a dementia friendly organisation. I have a personal interest as both of my late parents had severe dementia late in life and were cared for by family members who were greatly helped by the society. And it is the families and carers who often most need most support.\nShopmobility is probably thought of by many of you as a provider of mobility scooters to help people shop in the town centre, but the organisation has a much wider role and outreach to help all those with mobility problems, and there are many in the borough who would be completely housebound without this help. And we have Councillor Patel’s mobility scooter here to show us how important it is. In the audience tonight are some representatives of the charities and I hope Councillors will want to discuss the work of these charities with them later thisevening.\nI would also like to appeal to all Councillors and indeed to everyone in this room to make a resolution to support the Mayor’s charitable appeal, and support at least one of the Mayor’s charity events this year, to support these worthy organisations.\nNow, finally, I am advised that the Mayor may appoint a Chaplin and I am delighted that the Reverend Justine Middlemiss has agreed to be my Chaplin. Justine covers a number of churches in Sutton including the splendid Victorian church, Christchurch, in my Ward, which has splendid acoustics – as I know from playing the trumpet, a small part in a big band, in the church.\nNow, Justine asked me a very pertinent question when I spoke to her about being the Mayor’s Chaplin. She asked me what do I want a Chaplin for? Well, part of the job description is to give the Mayor spiritual guidance and spiritual uplift. And being as human as everyone else, there are moments I feel a bit down and in need of spiritual uplift. Whether or not I need much spiritual uplift in the next year may depend a bit on you – I am talking to the Councillors now – and on whether you are well behaved and orderly when I come to chair these meetings.\nBut I have an advantage. For the last two years of my life I have chaired Planning Committee. And if there is any one member of the Council who sometimes needs a bit of spiritual uplift it is the chair of Planning Committee. So can I say how delighted I am that a Councillor of the calibre of Councillor Bourne is succeeding me in taking on this portfolio. She will do the job much better than I did. And Sam, if you find, as I did, that from time to time you need a bit of spiritual uplift – I will loan you Justine.\nNow in a moment, if I can dispose of the rest of the agenda with dispatch, and I know Councillors will want to help me do this, we are going to enjoy the traditional reception put on by the incoming Mayor at these annual meetings. This is not a celebration of me, Councillor Patel and Councillor Cooke moving into these positions. It is a celebration we have once a year of the civic traditions of Sutton and our shared commitment to public service to the benefit of our residents. We know that there are sometimes pointed exchanges across the floor of the Council but there is much more that unites all of us in this room than that divides us. It is a mutual respect and a mutual belief that we all share in the virtues of public service, we would not be Councillors unless we had that shared belief, and tonight I would like you to share with me a celebration of these virtues.\nThat concludes my remarks under item 5, except to say it is a great honour to be elected Mayor of the borough. I am deeply touched. Gloria and I will do everything to repay the trust you have shown in us. It will be a great year for all of us, and I sincerely thank you.”",

This was the conclusion of the consultative police Ward panel meeting attended by Trish and Richard at Sutton police station on 2 October. Sutton is in fact a Borough with one of the lowest crime rates in London and Sutton South is a Ward with a low crime rate even by Sutton’s standards.\nThis was not a well attended meeting. We spent part of the time discussing the recent changes to consultation arrangements introduced by the Tory Mayor. They are not popular, and have led to the demise of the popular local Borough-wide consultative group. We discussed how we might meet in public in the future. The crime statistics presented by the police continue to show the Ward has low crime levels, with theft from vehicles one of the most common offences. Agreed priorities are burglary, theft from motor vehicles and anti-social behaviour.\nThis followed on from the first meeting since the election of the Ward police panel on 9 July at Sutton police station, a meeting Richard and Trish attended. We are considering the mechanics of making this meeting open to the public, or combining its meetings with those of the local committee, to make the meetings open.",

Richard and Trish have been responsible for getting the Council to plant many trees in our Ward, some to replace trees that were lost to disease but many new trees. Trees absorb carbon dioxide and pollution, and pump out oxygen. Sutton is amongst the leaders among the 32 London boroughs in the number of street trees per yard of pavement. This contributes to the pleasant, green, suburban atmosphere of the area we all so much enjoy, though it creates a headache every autumn when the leaves fall.\nThis planting activity has included trees in:\nUpland Road – outside 18, 20, 39. 103\nCamborne Road – outside 47/49, 32/34\nEffingham Close – 17, 26\nLangley Park Road – opposite 91 Egmont\nDevonshire Road – outside the school\nThe Ridgway – 18, 59\nChristchurch Park – one outside, and one opposite, White Lodge Close.",

Here is Richard’s grandson, Ciaran, enjoying playing on the installation. You can see how tatty it has become.\nThe refurbishment of the play area will see the removal and recycling of this damaged timber play equipment, comprising of over two hundred sleepers in various sizes. It will see the installation of new sleepers, wooden kickboards and “play bark safety surfacing” surrounding the play area. This will encourage children to stay active and provide an invaluable communal focal point in keeping with the natural materials of the Devonshire Avenue Nature Area.\nThe “memorial” bench that has been placed in the nature area, incorporating commemorative images remembering those who died in war, is a moving addition to the area. Here is Trish at the new bench.\nThe nature area is the only open space in our Ward and, particularly as many families live in flats with no access to a garden for children to play in, the nature area is an important amenity. The nature area has, during lockdown, like most parkland, been much more extensively visited than is normal. This has led to some erosion of its value as a nature area. We would greatly welcome the ideas of residents for improving it.\nWhile the Devonshire Avenue Nature Area is the only open space in our Ward, our residents make good use of Overton Park at the western end of the Ward and Warren Park at the eastern end. On 30 April Richard met with Council officers and other Councillors in Warren Park to discuss the vandalisation of the picket fence protecting the nature area in the park. We are anxious to preserve this chalk grassland nature site, which at certain times of year has a wonderful show of cowslips, ox-eye daisies and other wild plants, which will be lost if the area is trampled. Again, we would welcome views on how Warren Park might be improved.",
  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_page_42/content_280.html": "In the debate on the proposed closure of Oakleigh at Monday night’s Council Meeting, it was clear that this was not a straight forward matter. There were many different angles to consider and Heather addressed them in her contribution to the debate.\n“None of us can be comfortable about closing a care home for some of the most vulnerable people in our community.\nAnd one that has an excellent reputation.\nI visited Oakleigh as part of the investigation by the Health and Wellbeing Scrutiny Committee. The residents were happy and very well looked after. Care staff were totally committed to their work. I would be comfortable to see a relative of mine live there.\nI took therefore an challenging approach to the scrutiny exercise we undertook about Oakleigh.\nFrom the outset, I was shocked at the very high weekly cost to look after each resident. (one thousand and twenty four pounds) £1,024.\nThis confirmed research I’ve read from from the Dept of Health. Care homes run by councils are much more costly than those run by independent organisations. This is a nationwide phenomenon.\nIn the wider context, Sutton’s grant was dramatically cut by central government. We have to save over £30 million over the next 3 years. Savings of £10.5 million have to be found from the adult social care budget.\nSo the financial situation makes keeping an excellent, but costly, Oakleigh less possible.\nCurrent good practice says that people should be helped to stay in their own homes for as long as possible. Many would prefer to do so provided the right level and quality of support is there.\nAs part of the personalisation agenda, introduced by the last government, everyone eligible for social care has their own budget. This is based on what their needs are assessed to be. They should then be able to make their own choices about how to spend their money. All this has to happen within 18 months.\nThis means that it could be difficult for people to afford to stay at Oakleigh.\nThe key question is therefore whether there are other good quality care homes available in the borough?\nAs part of our investigation, we visited a wide range of care homes and found a wide range of quality.\nThe star rating system by the Care Quality Commission was not as helpful as we expected. ( now to be discontinued) Oakleigh was given a 3 star rating. Most care homes in the borough were given a 2 star rating. We found that some of these were excellent, some not very good.\nWe therefore recommended, that the Commissioning Unit and social workers, should work together to improve standards in those homes that had 2 stars.\nWe needed a Sutton based quality assurance, reflecting our values and standards. We could not rely on the Care Quality Commission. That organisation is in any case changing.\nWe also recommended that we should challenge the regulations that prevented us from transferring the business of Oakleigh to another, independent provider.\nOnce again Sutton demonstrated its commitment to consultation. It did challenge the Care Quality Commission successfully, and then went out for another 12 weeks consultation. Few councils would take that trouble.\nUnfortunately, no independent organisation was ready to bid for Oakleigh, probably because of the financial obligations when staff are transferred from one organisation to another.\nSo I have reluctantly concluded that there is no alternative to closing Oakleigh. I do realise what a blow this will be to those still living there, and to the hard working staff. Great efforts will be made to help people find new homes. Like my colleague I would like to say a big thank you to Link and to the dedicated staff at Oakleigh.”",

Here is the text of Richard’s speech on the parking consultation to the recent Council meeting.\n“I am in my ninth year as a Councillor.\nFrom day one, parking has been one of the major issues my residents complain to me about.\nAnd it is obvious why – Sutton South Ward is close to the town centre, in the area close to the station there is intense demand for parking so it is rationed by making it a controlled parking zone, then you get to the area just outside the zone.\nThe example I always give is Mayfield Road which is the first road you come to outside the controlled zone walking east. So this road has bumper to bumper parking every day except Sunday, and the residents get fed up with it and campaign continuously for parking controls.\nOver my nine years there have been several surveys of residents’ views on parking controls in Mayfield and neighbouring roads, including in 2016 when the three Ward Councillors – Councillor Shields, Councillor Fivey and myself, working across party lines as we often do – agreed a scheme with the traffic engineers which residents in Mayfield and neighbouring roads were consulted on. That scheme was abandoned as residents in other roads nearby said “What about us?” Fortunately the Parking Strategy Consultation had just been agreed so we were able to abandon the more limited scheme and promise a wider consultation of a wider area. I particularly remember this as the residents of Mayfield Road were not happy at the abandonment of the parking scheme for their road and came to the local committee to protest, where Councillor Shields told them we now intended to undertake a more “holistic” survey of the whole area. I particularly remember this as he used the word “holistic” and the residents looked at each other, seemingly wondering what this word meant.\nSo we, the Ward Councillors, jointly made a commitment to this consultation.\nI think the staged consultation exercise is the best approach. It enables residents to see what is proposed for the wider area around them, based on the opinions of residents in the first round of consultation, and to modify their views accordingly in the second round.\nAnd there will be a third round of consultation. Some residents say to me you are endlessly consulting, when are you going to do something?\nThe aim is to discover what the prevailing opinion is, and do what residents want.\nOf course, whatever the result, even in some roads where there is a strong prevailing opinion, some people will be unhappy.\nBut that is no reason to hide under the table and not tackle what residents see as an important problem. We should not ignore it.\nNow there are some bits of misinformation and distractions put about.\nThe “an abstention will be a positive vote” story has been adequately discredited. Of course, in Sutton South as a whole most residents are unaffected by these changes but in the roads affected there is a ferment of debate and social media helps spread awareness – every day someone tells me of some new Whatsapp or Facebook page. I cannot keep up.\nThe cash cow: parking schemes bring enforcement costs which have to be covered, though in fact of the 32 London Boroughs Sutton is one of the cheapest places to park. And we all know that the decision in the 2013 Barnet Council v Attfield case prohibits cross subsidisation of other Council services from parking charges, and as chair of the Audit and Governance Committee I can tell you that the external auditors would come down on us instantly if we breached that. In Sutton South the changes currently out for consultation would not increase revenue but would have costs.\nEmissions based charging: I am not very green, we have two cars. The road tax – a charge set by Government – on my petrol driven Nissan is £120 a year. On my hybrid Honda it is £10. A massive difference. So relating charges to vehicle emissions is not an idea invented in the London Borough of Sutton, it is Government policy, a Conservative Government.\nFrom next year the Ultra Low Emissions Zone will mean I will pay to drive my Nissan – but not my Honda – north of the south circular road, and with current public concern over the impact of vehicle emissions on air quality I would wager that the general direction of public policy in the UK in the next few years will be further in this direction, not in the direction of the abolition of such differential charges, which I see is the policy of Sutton Conservatives, but evidently not that of the Conservative party nationally.\nSome residents in my Ward ask about the closure of the Brighton Road car park, six years ago. We can draw a distinction between people who are prepared to pay for parking and those not prepared to pay. If the people who park in the roads near Brighton Road were prepared to pay for parking – so might have parked in the Brighton Road car park, demolished six years ago – they could park at the Gibson Road car park, closer to the town centre, ten minutes walk from Brighton Road, which is never full.\nThe choice for Brighton Road is – is this site better used as the HQ of a major international company, creating 900 jobs in Sutton that would otherwise have been in Epsom, or as a half-empty car park ten minutes walk from another multi-storey car park which is never full.\nMy simple point on the parking strategy is this, we should consult our residents, and then do what they want us to do. It is not complicated.”",

There can be no more telling indicator of disadvantage than needing to seek help for something as basic as feeding your family.\nI welcome and support the help given to those in desperate need by the foodbanks, but I feel uncomfortable with the fact that in what is still on some measures the seventh most affluent country in the World some of our families are needing to seek the help of a private charity for something as basic as food to eat, and that the foodbanks – conceived as a response to short term needs – are in danger of becoming a permanent part of the structure of welfare support in Britain.\nThe Council has, of course, a number of schemes to assist those who are in the most severe financial distress, including giving appropriate help to the Foodbank. Government policy has not always helped.\nI am concerned with the way the Government has “localised” one of the main planks in helping those in need, the Crisis Loans and Grants Scheme. This is a scheme that assists those in real crisis situations. Many families receiving welfare support are struggling week by week and just keeping their head above water, but it can be the unexpected event that tips them over the edge – which may be into the hands of the Payday loan providers. The Crisis Loans and Grants scheme is a lifeline in these situations, and has helped over 800 individuals this year. But from the next financial year the central funding passed down when the scheme was localised is simply being axed, a cut of over £400 thousand. There is, at some point in the future, going to be a difficult debate about how the Council maintains an acceptable level of support to people in those situations.\nThe Council also offers help in other ways, in particular through Discretionary Housing Payments and the Council Tax Reduction scheme.\nCouncil officers have meetings with the organisers of the foodbank. The Council has assisted with accommodation in Apple Lodge on the Sutton Court estate, in my Ward, storage (with the Big Yellow Storage company) and with limited assistance by way of food vouchers from the Crisis Loans and Grants budget. This is because I understand the foodbank struggles to provide certain types of food, such as fresh food, as the donations are mostly of particular types of food, and they do of course want to provide a balanced diet.\nThe foodbank also offers debt advice to help residents manage their finances better, which is important.\nWe must congratulate the organisers of the foodbank on the service they are providing to our most disadvantaged residents – which may include the 600 plus households affected by the bedroom tax and the 150 plus affected by the benefit cap, locally. But we need at the same time to seek to ensure that help is given to stop families getting into the position where they need the help of the foodbank. This means continuing with the assistance we currently give, trying to protect the resources devoted to these schemes, but also seeking to help people out of this situation.\nA major way of doing that is helping those out of work find jobs, for which reason our successful employment generation programmes under the banner of Opportunity Sutton are so essential. These policies must run together.”",

Heather and Richard have met the headteachers of both schools to discuss the consequences for local people and the management of the process, recognising the concerns of some parents at Barrow Hedges about possible detrimental effects, such as on parking.\nBoth headteachers have assured us that they see benefits for the schools from the expansion.\nBarrow Hedges school usually has about 300 applications for places each year – more applicants are turned away than get in to the school. Up to 2008 Barrow Hedges school had an intake of 60 children per year. Since then it has been 90 and the proposal is to stick to this number. When only 60 children were admitted you usually had to live within 600 metres of the school to get in, so only parents in a few roads at the east end of Sutton South ward could get their children into this school. The expansion will mean more Sutton South children get into the school.\nMore parents in Sutton South Ward send their children to Devonshire Avenue school, and the expansion of this school, with associated improvements to its facilities, is also to be welcomed.\nThis is good news for Sutton South.",

The Council has set a responsible budget concentrating its resources on those in greatest need. The background to the debate is that over the last ten years our core central Government funding has been reduced by more than 60% in real terms and we continue to face unprecedented financial pressures.\nTrish made a moving speech about the need for additional resources for perinatal services. Here is Richard’s speech:\n“I am in my tenth year as a Councillor and I find these annual budget debates in some ways ever more difficult.\nBut we need to lift our eyes.\nIt was about seventy years ago that the famous American economist J.K. Galbraith, a hero of mine, coined the phrase “private affluence and public squalor”, pointing out that society spends enormous sums of money on some goods and services while services that are collectively funded by society are generally kept very short of money, something he ascribed, rightly, to the obsession of the political right with cutting taxes and reducing the size of the state.\nIn modern Britain, we undoubtedly have this phenomenon – made much worse by austerity.\nThe collectively funded services that in my view society fails to fund adequately include education, hospitals, social care, social housing, welfare, help for the homeless, children’s services, libraries, and support for children with special educational needs. I could go on. And also some services that those on the political right might also want to spend more money on, like the welfare of the armed services.\nWe need more support for public services but we know that in Tory Britain we will not get it, which makes setting a responsible and well targeted budget of such great importance.\nWhat stands out from this budget statement is the responsibility shown.\nWe are raising revenue, insofar as we can\nWe are not relying on raiding further our meagre reserves.\nWe are concentrating spending on the priorities that help those in most need.\nThere is a lot of Government rhetoric about at the moment about ending austerity, but if you look at the actuality of Government policy and spending commitments it remains overall highly fiscally restricted, with much made of a boost in what is a limited number of areas.\nThe reality is that over the last ten years our core central Government funding has been reduced by more than 60% in real terms and we continue to face unprecedented financial pressures as a result of grant reductions, underfunded new burdens from central Government and increased demand for services – due to demographic pressures and the impact of austerity, particularly cuts in welfare support for those in poverty.\nWhile we’re managing with less, more people than ever need our help – child poverty has grown, more people are using food banks.\nAbout two thirds of our spending is on support to vulnerable adults and children – including on caring for older people, “looked after” children, and people with learning and physical disabilities who need help to live independently.\nThe way our expenditure is skewed in this way, skewed by our statutory obligations but also our wish to concentrate spending on those in greatest need, is something that I think is not widely realised by our residents, most of whom are of course not consumers of those services.\nAnd it concerns me that if you look at the Council’s risk statement there are areas where the Council faces difficulty in meeting even its statutory obligations – including homelessness, provision for those with Special Educational Needs, Homecare services, and support for child asylum seekers.\nBut we are an authority pursuing highly responsible policies to keep our head above water and maintaining the absolute priority policies that help the most vulnerable\nSo my feeling is we can be proud of this budget is – the themes being\n1 there are major problems to be tackled\n2 there is a very responsible approach and\n3 there are policies to support those in greatest need.”",

The Council considered that the proposed development, by reason of its height, bulk, mass and detailed design, would constitute an unsympathetic form of development that would have a negative visual impact on the Cavendish Road street scene. The proposed development would therefore have a detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the area.\nThe Council also turned the application down because it considered that at least some affordable housing ought to be provided as part of an acceptable development on this site and, as such, the proposal would cause significant harm to the promotion of mixed and balanced communities.\nAn earlier application was also turned down but is now the subject of an appeal to the Planning Inspectorate. This is a threat we cannot control. We will let residents know the outcome and if further applications are made.\nA proposal for a house extension in Downside Road was also rejected as it would close the visual gap between houses, causing harm to the spacious and open character of the road and result in a visual terracing impact on the street scene.",
  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_2016_03_13_threatened-closure-of-sutton-station-ticket-office/content_45.html": "Southern have been consulting on certain changes to Sutton station that will involve the closure of the ticket office. The details are on their website at\nRichard and Trish have helped draft the response from the Council, opposing this change. The following is an extract from the lengthy and considered Council response.\n“The Council strongly objects to the proposed closure of Sutton ticket office. Sutton is the 6 th busiest station on the Southern network and 7th busiest in south London, having almost 7 million passenger entries and exits per annum. The Council has major growth plans for Sutton, a Metropolitan town centre, in terms of housing and employment, which will result in a significant increase in station usage over the next decade. The Council has also recently completed the Station Gateway scheme at Sutton, which made some significant improvements to area outside the station, as well as opening the side entrance. The ticket office at Sutton is well used most of the time and there is often a queue. We consider that the ticket office at Sutton should remain open during the peak times at least, and this should include the busy periods at weekends when there are a considerable number of leisure and infrequent passengers who do not have smartcards and may need advice or help. Outside peak times sufficient staff should be available on the concourse to sell tickets and assist passengers with the machines. As the station concourse in front of the ticket barriers at Sutton is quite small and congested we would suggest having a station host desk or podium in the existing ticket hall with a formal queuing system as for the ticket office. Many stations in your “Model 3″ outside London have much lower usage than Sutton yet are to retain their ticket office, and we consider it is important that this major London Metropolitan town centre should retain a ticket office facility.”\nWe have reproduced below some of the key points made by Southern, taken from their website. Most residents use the train service from Sutton station from time to time and those we have discussed this issue with support our view that this is a proposal we should object to.\nCHANGES AT SUTTON STATION\nSouthern point out that the majority of customers use ticket machines rather than the ticket office. They propose to establish a “station hosting point” with the staff available on the concourse, able to sell the full range of tickets from first to last train. They propose to move staff onto the concourse as ‘Station Hosts’\nThe website states that Station Hosts will be:\n- visible and available from first service until the last, which is longer than current ticket office hours\n- trained in customer service\n- able to sell tickets and provide information using a new handheld device\n- helping passengers use the ticket machines\nSutton station will have a Host on duty at specified times, Monday to Friday 5.25 to 23.00, Saturday 6.25 to 23.00, Sunday 7.00 to 23.00, these being in excess of the current ticket office hours as the ticket office closes at 9pm. The Host will provide assistance with ticket purchases, information provision and assisted travel. The Host will have a hand held ticketing system that will enable them to provide tickets that are not available from the self-service machines.\nThe Ticket Office will close. The primary point for purchasing tickets on the station will be from the self-service machines or from the Station Host. In the event that a ticket type is not available through these machines then the Host will have access to a ticket office machine within the concourse area to enable those ticket types to be issued.\nSouthern State “At some of our stations we know that our ticket offices sell fewer than 12 tickets per hour and the vast majority of customers don’t use the ticket offices on a daily basis. At these stations, we want our staff to become more available for all users of the station and ensure there is a visible presence on our station concourses where they can help customers with all of their queries, provide information, offer assistance and have the ability to sell tickets when needed.\nAt some of our busier stations, we want to relocate the ticket selling equipment to a station hosting point so the staff are available on the concourse, able to sell the full range of tickets but for longer times than today.\nWe believe that this will provide an improved customer experience, with all the affected stations being staffed from the very first to last train, 7 days a week. Facilities such as waiting rooms will be open for longer and Station Hosts will be available answering customer queries, providing advice and assisting with ticket purchases.”",

If you have the odd half hour a few times a year to support us in this way please contact us. We recently prepared an end of year newsletter to update our volunteer deliverers on our activities. We thought we would share it with those who look at our website.\n“The last year has been our most successful year in Sutton South Ward.\nWith the election of Luke as our Member of Parliament in July we have, for the first time, three Liberal Democrat Councillors representing our Ward and a Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament representing us at Westminster.\nWe held a successful Ward meeting on 28 November where we heard from Luke on the incredibly busy life he now has as our Member of Parliament. He has been meeting all the important community groups in Sutton and Cheam, and has made speeches in Parliament on a variety of issues – ranging from the importance of support for carers to the future of Taiwan. In his maiden speech he spoke about what a pleasant place Sutton is to live, work and raise a family, a great change from the previous MP who spent all his time running Sutton down. He is enthusiastic about his role as spokesperson for London.\nAs Ward Councillors, we have a lot of local casework that we deal with and are doing more than our fair bit as Chairs of Council committees – Trish chairing the Audit and Governance Committee, Richard the Planning Committee and Louise combining being chair of the Licensing Committee with her role as Deputy Mayor. This is her second year as Deputy Mayor following the three years during which Trish was Mayor.\nLike every local authority, Sutton Council is pre-occupied by financial issues and struggling with some difficult decisions to balance the books. The decision to close the Registrar’s office (The Russetings) in Worcester Road was one we regretted, driven by a need to consolidate services in fewer buildings, but we believe planning controls are sufficient to protect the appearance of this attractive, locally listed, building in the street scene.\nWe have secured funding for improvements to the WArd, including new information signs at the only open space in our Ward – the Devonshire Avenue Nature Area (DANA). Maintenance of the nature area involves a balance of ensuring it is a peaceful place for people to visit while preserving the biodiversity of the site. There is now a Friends of DANA group – let us know if you would like to join it.\nWe are already looking forward to our next electoral challenge, to retain control of the Council in 2026. We need to keep up the work of talking to our residents, delivering our literature and doorknocking. Let us know if you are interested in being one of our candidates. We welcome talking or corresponding with you and with all our residents. We hope to have further Ward meetings next year. We are really\ngrateful for the help we get.”",

I am sorry it has not yet done so. This policy weakens planning law further and will lead to neighbour on neighbour disputes over ugly extensions. It is a recipe for neighbourhood disputes and the erection of ugly buildings that society does not want, and that we certainly do not want in Sutton. ”\nThe motion pased on 5 November was also critical of the envisaged interference of the Planning Inspectorate in local decisions on planning applications, affordable housing and section 106 contributions.\nThis is the full text of Richard’s speech:\n“It is right that the London Borough of Sutton, which has been at the intellectual vanguard of so many policies in local Government, should be at the forefront in leading a campaign against the proposals of the Government to weaken planning law.\nThe motion is a balanced motion in that we are complimenting the Government on aspects of the announcement made on 6 September that we support, but we are making clear what we oppose.\nWe support proposals concerning the funding of new affordable housing, the refurbishment of empty homes, support for the FirstBuy shared equity scheme and support for housing associations.\nBut we are critical of the extension of permitted development rights, and the envisaged interference of the Planning Inspectorate in local decisions on planning applications, affordable housing and section 106 contributions.\nWhat we are saying tonight is entirely consistent with our actions and our words on planning issues.\nIt is consistent with our words in that we had an excellent debate on planning policy at the Council meeting on 17 October last year. I remember speaking in that debate and noting what we have achieved in Sutton in adopting and refining a planning policy that has secured the green, pleasant, suburban character of Sutton that we all treasure. But we noted in that debate threats and concerns that arose from national policy. We welcomed many aspects of the National Planning Policy Framework but saw four difficulties with the planning system that should be addressed – and for each of these I could cite specific examples in Sutton South Ward:\n1. that what is permitted development is already quite permissive and is leading to people building large and intrusive structures that should be brought within planning controls\n2. that the planning system is slow moving in dealing with developers who are recalcitrant and play the system\n3. the decisions of the Planning Inspectorate are sometimes inconsistent and unhelpful\n4. the Courts do not always seem to take breaches of planning law seriously.\nThese problems remain but, sadly, the Government has not taken our advice set out in the motion we passed. Indeed, it has moved in an opposite direction in what is now proposed.\nWhat is proposed seems to abandon the National Planning Policy Framework, does not address any of the problems that concerned us, and loosens further permitted development law.\nI do not believe for one second that the relaxation of requirements to seek planning permission for extensions to domestic properties is going to unleash an avalanche of building work, thus creating jobs. To the extent that this happens, it follows that this will be through the erection of buildings that would not be permitted under current arrangements. So this is a recipe for neighbourhood disputes and the erection of ugly buildings that society does not want, and that we certainly do not want in Sutton.\nI also particularly object to the way the package deals with affordable housing and section 106 contributions. Like most of you, I find that quite a lot of my casework as a Councillor involves families that are living in poor circumstances, often because they cannot find and afford accommodation that fits their needs. We desperately need more affordable housing. There are already “get out” clauses for developers who present financial analyses seemingly proving their development is unviable if they have to provide affordable housing. I am deeply suspicious of those processes and now there are to be further “get out” routes involving the Planning Inspectorate.\nWhat we say in this motion is also consistent with our actions. We have adopted stringent controls on development to ensure it meets the local needs of Sutton, particularly on the development of major sites and on back garden development. We do not want these interfered with by remote bodies in Whitehall and Bristol.\nWe have worked hard to control development in Sutton in a way that meets what local people want. And so much flows from the way the character of the area is preserved by our planning policies, making it an attractive environment for businesses and families. I never tire of telling people of the virtues of Sutton – low crime, good schools, attractive leafy streets, good transport connections, voted the best place in London to bring up children, a local economy that is surviving the recession well. All these things, to my mind, hinge crucially on having an attractive local environment and street scene.\nI hope these proposals will be re-thought.\nI strongly believe, in the words of the motion, that it is local people, through democratically elected local authorities, who are the best judges of what development is acceptable in an area.\nI commend this motion to Council.”",

It also ordered the applicant Centro to pay for all the costs involved.\nThe decision paves the way for the council to continue the sale of the 1.36 acre site to Subsea 7 to expand its operations. The new development allows Subsea 7 to more than double its workforce over the coming years, preserves up to 780 jobs for Sutton, and makes the area more attractive for other firms to invest.\nIt is the third major investment secured by Sutton Council’s investment arm Opportunity Sutton in recent months with almost 500 new homes, retail and other commercial opportunities planned for the Sutton Point and the old gas works sites.\nThe High Court’s decision vindicates Sutton’s planning process. We now we have the green light to work with Subsea 7 to ensure Sutton benefits from a major investment, new jobs and other economic opportunities.\nOur Opportunity Sutton economic programme is working to attract new businesses and development, and in just 18 months of operation it has already attracted over £322 million in planned investment, including the new Subsea 7 office.\nWhile the Judicial Review application was waiting to be heard, Sutton Council had to pay for a package of security measures – expenses which could have been avoided if the JR application had not taken place.\nThe Council will now work with Subsea 7 for them to take responsibility for the site’s security arrangements – freeing the tax payer of this burden.\nThe plans are one of a number of high profile developments that Sutton has attracted through its inward investment arm Opportunity Sutton.\nLast summer developer CNM Estates was given the green light to extend the existing Sutton Point building next to Sutton Station to a 22 storey high building with two new buildings connected to it that altogether will offer deliver 300 apartments, a 130 bed hotel and shops and restaurants. The development could generate up to 750 jobs.\nIn October Sutton Council granted developer LXB Retail Properties permission to build 186 apartments, a supermarket, shops, restaurants and a public plaza on an old gas works site off the High Street. The development is expected to generate 500 jobs.\nThe Subsea7 project came about because last year a report by Sutton Council found that there were high levels of surplus parking spaces in council run car parks in the town centre – enough to absorb any displaced by the closure of Brighton Road Car Park. Since the closure of the car park, traffic monitoring has indicated that there have been no adverse effects on the parking or traffic in the town centre.\nThis project will bring jobs to the Ward, raise property prices as demand for local housing increases, and have an uplifting effect on the local economy with 800 workers spending money in local shops, hotels and restaurants.”",

Currently there are over 120 cadets. However, the decision has been made to close junior cadets and cut the remaining senior cadets to just 46. Their future programme is also being severely curtailed. This will have a major impact on the youth of this borough who will no longer have the opportunity to participate in activities such as camps, parades and Duke of Edinburgh awards.\nCouncillor Louise Phelan, whose son has been a Cadet, commented “I’ve seen first-hand the benefits of being part of police cadets. They learn valuable life skills, and gain self confidence. They also support the local community and get to take part in things they wouldn’t otherwise have had the opportunity to do. For many this is a stepping stone into a career within the police force, for others the Cadets help to keep them on the right path and make better life decisions. I am incredibly concerned others will now not get these opportunities.”",

It is a pity these public meetings attract so few members of the public, only four tonight. The police priorities for the next quarter will include seeking Neighbourhood Watch co-ordinators at Farm Close and Audley Place, and tackling the problem of rough sleepers in Ambleside Gardens and Beauclere House, in Brighton Road. There was also discussion of the theft of bins at blocks of flats in Brighton Road and in Christchurch Park. The overall level of crime in the area remains low.\nThe police are very keen to monitor any community tensions that might have arisen as a result of the EU referendum. Emotions may run high for a while and there have been some reports in the national media about a rise in hate crime and harassment in some areas. We have not heard of any such incidents locally; but obviously the police rely very much upon the community and the Neighbourhood Watch to monitor things like this for them.\nIf you have detected any such issues – or know of anyone who has – please do not hesitate to contact Sutton police to report them.\nIf anyone wishes to make an anonymous report they can always call Crimestoppers at any time – day or night – on 0800 555 111, in complete confidence.\nOn 6 July Richard, by invitation, attended the Eid celebrations held annually in Overton Park (see picture above) at the end of Ramadan, to show his support for multculturalism and opposition to hate crime.\nCllr Ruth Dombey, Leader of Sutton Council, Niall Bolger, Chief Executive of Sutton Council, Cllr Tim Crowley, Leader of the Opposition at Sutton Council, and Sutton Borough Police Commander Dave Stringer said in a joint statement on 30 June:\n“Since the EU referendum result there have been media reports of hate crimes against people living in this country. However, there has been no increase in hate crime incidents reported to the police in Sutton and across London.\n“We are grateful that Sutton has not seen an increase in such intolerant and antisocial behaviour. The vote is not a licence for racist and xenophobic behaviour. We would urge residents to be vigilant to ensure that all borough citizens continue to live together in a peaceful, harmonious and responsible way.\n“We are aware that certain events can spur intolerance, hate or extremism. Anyone who witnesses or suffers any hate incident of any type should report it immediately to the Police so that they can take action and deal with any incidents quickly.\n“Sutton is a popular place to live, in part because we are a tolerant, open society that values people of all cultures, nationalities and religions. At this time it is more important than ever that we show solidarity with our neighbours of all different faith and cultural groups to ensure that extremist views and behaviour have no part of our community.”",

There were many different angles to consider and Heather addressed them in her contribution to the debate.\n“None of us can be comfortable about closing a care home for some of the most vulnerable people in our community.\nAnd one that has an excellent reputation.\nI visited Oakleigh as part of the investigation by the Health and Wellbeing Scrutiny Committee. The residents were happy and very well looked after. Care staff were totally committed to their work. I would be comfortable to see a relative of mine live there.\nI took therefore an challenging approach to the scrutiny exercise we undertook about Oakleigh.\nFrom the outset, I was shocked at the very high weekly cost to look after each resident. (one thousand and twenty four pounds) £1,024.\nThis confirmed research I’ve read from from the Dept of Health. Care homes run by councils are much more costly than those run by independent organisations. This is a nationwide phenomenon.\nIn the wider context, Sutton’s grant was dramatically cut by central government. We have to save over £30 million over the next 3 years. Savings of £10.5 million have to be found from the adult social care budget.\nSo the financial situation makes keeping an excellent, but costly, Oakleigh less possible.\nCurrent good practice says that people should be helped to stay in their own homes for as long as possible. Many would prefer to do so provided the right level and quality of support is there.\nAs part of the personalisation agenda, introduced by the last government, everyone eligible for social care has their own budget. This is based on what their needs are assessed to be. They should then be able to make their own choices about how to spend their money. All this has to happen within 18 months.\nThis means that it could be difficult for people to afford to stay at Oakleigh.\nThe key question is therefore whether there are other good quality care homes available in the borough?\nAs part of our investigation, we visited a wide range of care homes and found a wide range of quality.\nThe star rating system by the Care Quality Commission was not as helpful as we expected. ( now to be discontinued) Oakleigh was given a 3 star rating. Most care homes in the borough were given a 2 star rating. We found that some of these were excellent, some not very good.\nWe therefore recommended, that the Commissioning Unit and social workers, should work together to improve standards in those homes that had 2 stars.\nWe needed a Sutton based quality assurance, reflecting our values and standards. We could not rely on the Care Quality Commission. That organisation is in any case changing.\nWe also recommended that we should challenge the regulations that prevented us from transferring the business of Oakleigh to another, independent provider.\nOnce again Sutton demonstrated its commitment to consultation. It did challenge the Care Quality Commission successfully, and then went out for another 12 weeks consultation. Few councils would take that trouble.\nUnfortunately, no independent organisation was ready to bid for Oakleigh, probably because of the financial obligations when staff are transferred from one organisation to another.\nSo I have reluctantly concluded that there is no alternative to closing Oakleigh. I do realise what a blow this will be to those still living there, and to the hard working staff. Great efforts will be made to help people find new homes. Like my colleague I would like to say a big thank you to Link and to the dedicated staff at Oakleigh.”",

Keeping the company in Sutton will also protect over 200 jobs the company currently have located in the Borough, which could move elsewhere. Overall, this development could be worth 1 000 jobs.\nThe company wants to build a brand new state-of-the-art office to meet its particular needs, on the site of the Brighton Road car park. The design they showed Richard and Heather, for a building designed by renowned architects ESA, only a little higher than the car park but a much more attractive building, would be an iconic structure in the “Gateway to Sutton” that is the Brighton Road. It would bring jobs and development to an area that needs it.\nJobs are gold dust, and there is intense competition between local authorities for such inward investment. In the current recession, a situation where an engineering firm is sufficiently confident of its future to open a new HQ building is most unusual. However, after considering many options, Sutton is the company’s current preferred site. The popularity of Sutton with those of their employees who live in Sutton – our good schools, low crime rate, pleasant suburban atmosphere, voted the best place in London to bring up children – is a factor in their preference for a site in Sutton. They have considered buildings in Sutton currently empty, but have very particular needs and a preference to build their own bespoke headquarters building.\nResidents have been reassured that parking in the Borough will still be easily accessible despite the loss of Brighton Road car park. Research carried out for an independent report on the likely impact shows that there are high levels of surplus parking spaces in nearby car parks in the town centre, enough to absorb any displaced should Brighton Road Car Park close.\nThis is an opportunity to create hundreds of jobs for local people and in turn support existing businesses in the Borough. We have declared that Sutton is “open for business” and we will strive to seize those opportunities that will bring positive benefits for the area and for our residents. Given the scale of the impact on employment, it would be irresponsible of the Council not to engage with the company to see if its highly specific needs can be met.\nThat said, any proposal will of course need to be fully examined within the Council’s planning procedures.\nRichard has spoken before about the extent of hidden poverty in Sutton South, often associated with people – both young people who have never had a job and those made redundant in their 50s who find they are one of twenty applicants for every job – not being able to find work. Jobs are gold dust. As vice-chair of the Housing, Economy and Business Committee he is aware of how important this development is for Sutton.",

There was discussion of current crime trends, including recent burglaries and attempted burglaries in Mayfield Road.\nWhile the police were unable to give a reason for these incidents they commented that sometimes there is a “clustering” of crime in an area for a short period for no obvious reason, but it would be unusual for it to persist as a problem. They have moved quickly to re-assure residents and have knocked on doors in Mayfield Road, and left a feedback form where there was no-one in. If you have any observations you want to make to the local police you can contact them on ztsnt-suttonsouth@met.police.uk\nAlso, nine local residents attended their recent street briefing.\nWhile no-one can ever be complacent and we must all maintain our vigilance, it remains the case that this Ward is a low crime area, indeed one of the safest areas in south London. Burglary, along with theft from motor vehicles, remains a police priority for the area, but the most common form of burglary in our area is theft from garages, and residential (house) burglaries are mercifully rare.\nThe meeting also discussed future action on speeding, a dog seizure in Cumnor Road, a cannabis factory in Westmoreland Drive and the success of the extension of the “No Drinking Zone” to our Ward.\nWe also discussed the introduction of the “London Policing Model” on 24 June.

The Council considered that the proposed development, by reason of its height, bulk, mass and detailed design, would constitute an unsympathetic form of development that would have a negative visual impact on the Cavendish Road street scene. The proposed development would therefore have a detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the area.\nThe Council also turned the application down because it considered that at least some affordable housing ought to be provided as part of an acceptable development on this site and, as such, the proposal would cause significant harm to the promotion of mixed and balanced communities.\nAn earlier application was also turned down but is now the subject of an appeal to the Planning Inspectorate. This is a threat we cannot control. We will let residents know the outcome and if further applications are made.\nA proposal for a house extension in Downside Road was also rejected as it would close the visual gap between houses, causing harm to the spacious and open character of the road and result in a visual terracing impact on the street scene.",

Richard raised over £26 000 for his charity appeal for Sutton Shopmobility and the Alzheimer’s Society.\nIn the course of his Mayoral year Richard attended several hundred events in the Borough. The range of these events is enormous. They include:\n- opening the various open-air festivals, carnivals and fêtes that are held in Sutton in the summer months\n- opening new shops, pubs and business premises\n- attending events at churches, mosques, the synagogue and schools\n- attending school prizegiving evenings at most of our schools in Sutton\n- taking part in many Citizenship ceremonies, at which local residents from distant parts of the world took British citizenship\n- attending many 100th birthday parties\n- attending scout camps\n- attending award ceremonies, particularly for young people and for the many groups of cadets – police cadets, sea cadets, air cadets and the combined cadet forces of some of our schools\n- turning on the Christmas lights, which he did four times.\nAnd of course hundreds of events organised by the many voluntary groups in Sutton. And going to a few football and cricket matches, not just Sutton United but many local teams who have invited him to their games and to give out the awards at end-of-season prizegivings.\nHe has also represented the Borough at important events in London and in Surrey where the Borough should be represented, ranging from the pan-London Citizenship Ceremonies organised by the Mayor of London to more poignant occasions such as the service at Westminster Abbey to remember those killed in the terrorist action in Westminster last March.\nHe has also held receptions in the Mayor’s Parlour for about a dozen groups of people whose contribution to Sutton needs to be recognised – including carers, the local business community, food bank volunteers, the arts network, and of course Sutton United Football Club.\nRichard recollects that there was a day in March when, in one day, he opened the new Poundland store in Sutton town centre, opened the Red Lion pub in Hackbridge which had been closed for re-furbishment, attended a 100th birthday party for a local resident, and held a reception for food bank volunteers in the Mayor’s Parlour. And there were two other invitations on that day that he had to pass to his Deputies as he could not fit them in. This demonstrates the demands on his time\nRichard has had to do some challenging things as Mayor, including dressing up as Father Christmas to go out with the Sutton and Cheam Rotary Club collecting money for charity. This has left him with a rich fund of anecdotes about his discussions with small children when dressed as Father Christmas, which he offers to regale people with.\nRichard sometimes had to chair the Annual General Meetings of local groups who have it in their constitution that the Mayor will chair their AGM. Chairing Council meetings is sometimes a bit tricky, so you would think that chairing the meetings of bodies like the Sutton Swimming Association, Sutton Seniors Forum and the Friends of Whitehall would be a doddle. It was not always so.\nRichard said when he was elected that he hoped his Mayoralty would be remembered for some good music. There have been some great concerts to support his charity appeal, including by The Surrey Yeomanry Band, the Sutton Youth Wind Orchestra, The Phoenix Concert Band, the Norwood Wind Ensemble and the Show Choir – not to mention the group of musicians led by Richard that played Christmas carols in the St Nicholas Centre on several Saturdays before Christmas to raise funds, and the performance by the Clockhouse Choir at one of his dinners. Councillor Wendy Mathys attended all his concerts so deserves a special prize.\nIt has to be said that 2017 was a good year to be Mayor of Sutton as the year will be remembered as ranking alongside 1970 (remember Leeds United) and 1989 (remember Coventry City) as a year when Sutton United football club achieved great things in the FA Cup. The Mayor was one of the people guaranteed a ticket for the Sutton United v. Arsenal match, when the team acquitted themselves with honour, so a good year to be Mayor. There was worldwide interest in the Arsenal match, so much so that before the match he was much in demand for interviews on the general theme of “where is Sutton?”. He was interviewed by radio and TV teams from, amongst other places, Turkey, Russia and South Korea.\nRichard’s charity appeal has raised over £26 000 for his two excellent charities.",

It will now be held on Tuesday 26 March from 3pm to 9pm in addition to the exhibition on 19 March. Both events will be at the Holiday Inn in Sutton.\nRichard and Heather have had further meetings with Subsea7, and the following is the text of their letter sent to local residents.\n“Since we learned of the proposed redevelopment of the Brighton Road Car Park site, we have been working hard to tackle the parking issues that might arise for residents in Sutton South. Although this is still very much work in progress, we thought it a good time to bring you up to date with what is going on.\nAs you know, the high-tech engineering firm Subsea 7 want to expand their presence in Sutton by building a brand new state-of-the-art Head Quarters for their international business. This may bring up to 500 new jobs.\nThe new building will be much more attractive than the existing Brighton Road Car Park and will be designed by a renowned firm of architects, ESA. It will form part of a renewed “Gateway to Sutton” along the Brighton Road from the South that, in addition to new jobs, will provide extra spending power for local shops, restaurants and hotels.\nKeeping the company in Sutton will also protect over 300 jobs that the company currently have located in the Borough so that they do not move elsewhere.\nSubsea 7 have considered other buildings in Sutton that are currently empty, like Sutherland House, but have found that these are not satisfactory for the needs of an international headquarters.\nThe Council undertook a parking capacity study that showed that Council public car parks are only 53 per cent full during the peak weekday period. This means that there is therefore 47 per cent spare capacity.\nBut the report did not address the specific issue of increased on-road parking in the Highfields area and adjacent roads, including Upland Road and Farm Road. We immediately pointed this out to the Council and were told that its purpose was to ensure that the loss of parking in the Brighton Road Car Park would not damage the town centre’s economy.\nWe have therefore asked for work to be undertaken on the impact on car parking in the Highfields area and adjacent roads. We have also asked for financial incentives to encourage those drivers who currently use the Brighton Road Car Park to go to the Gibson Road Car Park rather than drive up to the area outside the controlled parking zone. These discussions are ongoing.\nWe have discussed with Subsea 7 our concerns about on-road parking in Sutton South and, as part of any planning application, they will be required to submit a traffic impact survey. We have asked that the traffic survey also considers where commuters will park as a result of these changes, And what local impact it will have. The results of this study will then be taken in to account by the Council when it negotiates with Subsea 7 about their financial obligations to the local community. This is part of the normal process with any large planning development.\nThe next steps are as follows:\n- Subsea 7 will hold an exhibition on the proposed development at the Holiday Inn on 19 March and 26 March, and we do encourage you to visit it.\n- The Council’s Strategy and Resources Committee (which is made up of a number of Sutton Councillors from both parties) will consider whether they can agree Heads of Agreement with Subsea 7. This is basically an agreement to go ahead, subject to planning permission. The meeting is open to the public.\n- If the Heads of Agreement are agreed, Subsea 7 can then apply for planning permission and all aspects of their application, including the impact on parking, will be assessed against current planning standards. Residents have the opportunity to submit their comments on the application and the decision will be taken by the Council’s Development Control Committee, again made up of Sutton’s elected Councillors.”",
  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_page_9/content_446.html": "Trish and Richard intervened in the debate over an application for a licence to sell alcohol, from the Registrar’s Office in Worcester Road, The Russettings. They persuaded the office to limit the hours sought so that it did not extend into the evenings.\nThe office was happy to do this as they are closed in the evening. It seems the application for a licence in the evening was a mistake. They want to be able to provide the happy couple at the weddings they conduct with a glass of champagne. These weddings are always daytime events.\nRichard spoke at the hearing on the licence application. This is his speech:\n“The task of the committee is to satisfy itself that two very important objectives can be achieved simultaneously. There is no reason why they cannot be.\nThese are:\nFirst, the Registrar’s Office should be able to properly perform the important functions it discharges for the residents of Sutton, in a world where (I accept) the expectations of the community as to how these functions are discharged has changed a little.\nSecond, the Office should be a good neighbour and not disturb the peace and quiet of the residential area where it is situated.\nI would like to say a word about each of these objectives.\nThe Registrar’s Office has been in Worcester Road for over 50 years and its functions have changed little over time. I have been to weddings at the office, as a guest, to meetings and conferences there, and to Citizenship Ceremonies. During my year as Mayor I attended these every week to make a speech of welcome to new citizens. The importance of these functions to those who take part needs to be recognised. The day you get married, the day you take British citizenship, these are massive moments in life that stay in the memory and I know the office does all it can to ensure these are happy events. I have been to these events and found champagne is being served when it has been brought by the happy couple or, very occasionally, the new citizen. I think it quite appropriate that a glass of champagne should be available at these events. Those involved all want to make this a happy day and there is no reason atall to suppose that this will lead to disorder in the context of these carefully organised and conducted ceremonies. In fact, there is more of an element of control if champagne is being provided in a managed way rather than people bringing their own.\nOn the second objective, the expectations of the Councillors and the residents is that the Office will continue to be a good neighbour. That is vital and I am pleased the Office has emphasised its commitment to do this. I am pleased with the assurances that have been given about a limit on the supply of champagne and how these events will continue to be carefully organised. The changes the Office have made to the application to limit the hours and to daytime are, of course, of massive importance and re-assurance.\nThere was no reason why the licence should extend into the evening. These weddings are daytime events and the office is normally closed in the evening.\nI think it important this hearing today had taken place so we can get these assurances from the Office. The officers who run the Registrar’s Office know that were there to be any disorder and disturbance to local residents in the future, the Councillors and their employers would be immediately investigating. I very much hope the Office will continue to discharge these very important functions – which bring happiness to those who take part are are important, memorable days in their lives – without any undue disturbance to the neighbourhood beyond what has happened for the many years the Office has been in Worcester Road. “",

The first residents were moving in over the same weekend. The shops at the bottom are yet to be occupied. Sainsburys have changed their mind about opening a store there, but it would have been competing with the Tesco opposite.\nOccupation of these two buildings, increasing footfall in the area and business for local shops, restaurants and hotels, will have a positive effect on the local economy. And the Subsea7 project will keep many hundreds of jobs to our area that would otherwise have been in Epsom or Leatherhead, and add several hundred new jobs. Jobs are gold dust for the local economy.\nOn 24 November we attended the final meeting of the liaison group with Subsea7 and local residents that has monitored the progress of the project to build the new headquarters of Subsea7, here in Sutton.\nThe company will arrange visits for local residents to see inside the building when it is fully occupied. And discussions continue on a new pedestrian crossing outside the building, crossing Brighton Road, given the massively increased footfall from those who work in the building arriving at Sutton station and walking down Brighton Road.\nOn 4 September last year the Subsea7 building was “topped out.”\n“Topping out” is a ceremony traditionally held when the building has been built to its full height. Richard and Trish were there on the roof of the building when the final piece of concrete was put in place on 4 September.\nThe site won the Ivor Goodsite Hoarding Competition 2015! The site was one of 8 winners out of 48 entries nationally to receive the award which showcased the great artwork used on the hoarding, produced by local schools; Devonshire Primary and Overton Grange Secondary. The schools produced widely praised artwork on the themes of ‘Under the Sea’ and ‘Subsea 7’.\nThe picture below is of Trish and Richard with the Devonshire Avenue primary school artwork displayed at the site.\nFollowing consultation with residents on the parking arrangements in the side road separating the site from Raeburn House and Girtin House, now named Berridge Close, the road is now included in the controlled parking zone with parking bays in the road reserved for residents with parking permits.\nTesting system\nN",

This will ensure that cars crossing from that end will start their journey across the bridge from a more central position. They will be more visible, earlier, to cars coming from the other end and to pedestrians on the bridge. In addition, warning signs alerting drivers to the road narrowing and the presence of pedestrians are being upgraded and repositioned to make them more prominent.\nThe improvement is being funded by Transport for London. It is a small, low-cost but helpful step.\nConsultation with local residents led to some modifications to the original scheme.\nMore radical proposals, such as making it one way, widening the bridge or building a second bridge, are either too expensive or would be too inconvenient for drivers.\nRichard said “This is a useful safety improvement. I live locally and walk across the bridge almost every day. I am glad we have finally got an improvement to slow the traffic and assist pedestrians.”\nThe photo below is of the bridge viewed from the Hillcroome Road end before the works.

In his speech to the Committee Richard pointed out that the results showed Sutton as being well ahead of the average – 58% on value for money against a national average of 48%, 74% on satisfaction with the Council against a national average of 63%.\nAs ever the main issue raised when asked about problems is parking. Problems with the motor car – traffic congestion, speeding traffic, parking – are a major source of problems.

Their new base at the David Weir Leisure Centre from August marks a significant step for both the club and the community.\nThis move, made possible through Trish’s negotiations with Sutton Council, allows players to train locally and to engage more with local residents, something they could not do while training so far away. Players have visited Rosehill Bowling Club to meet residents, reinforcing community ties, and have helped in the campaign led by Trish to re-invigorate the bowling club, which was close to going out of existence. The photos below are of the team at the bowling club.\nTrish is a trustee of Sutton United Football Foundation, whose mission is to support people of all ages and abilities.

The nature area is the only open space in our Ward, in an area where many children live in flats without access to a garden. As it is the only open space in our Ward it is precious to us. It is a nature area so requires careful management. To join the Friends group email the Sutton Council officer leading the work, Dawn Fielding\ndawn.fielding@sutton.gov.uk\nWe have secured funding for improvements to the nature area – to the signage and the seating and to clean off the graffiti. On 18 October last year the three Councillors met with several Council officers from the Parks Department at the Nature Area to discuss improvements to the area, and we subsequently took proposals to the local committee to obtain funding for improvement work. On 23 January we met with the volunteers from Sutton Nature Conservation Volunteers who were engaged in necessary maintenance activities at the site. There is discussion about how to best use the area, protect biodiversity (such as the rare “ivy broomrape” which is found in the nature area) while keeping it well used by residents, reduce litter and graffiti, and whether it should be locked at night. Please contact us with your views and to join the Friends group.\nWhile the Nature Reserve is the only open space in our Ward two parks are adjacent – Warren Park at the north eastern boundary of the Ward and Overton Park at the south western boundary. There are also steps being taken to establish Friends groups for these parks, in particular Warren Park. If you live close to one of these parks and would like to join the Friends group contact Dawn Fielding\ndawn.fielding@sutton.gov.uk\nA CLEAN SWEEP FOR THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS IN SUTTON SOUTH WARD\nMEASURING TRAFFIC IN OUR WARD\nIt is some years since we have last had an exercise to measure the volume and speed of traffic in our Ward. The last time this happened it enabled us to introduce some measures to calm traffic in Cavendish Road. From Monday 19th February the tubes seen in this picture taken in The Ridgway, integral to traffic measurement equipment, appeared in many local roads at the eastern end of the Ward. The tubes collected data for seven days on the volume, speed and classification of vehicles.\nThe results of the exercise are listed below. The results have not led to some “standout” conclusion as to a problem that needs tackling. Traffic officers are examining three main issues:\n- whether action can be taken to improve the safety and the experience of pedestrians crossing the Kings Lane bridge without closing the road to vehicles. The bridge is narrow. Installing a second bridge would be impossibly expensive. Marking a pedestrian path at one side of the road might be feasible\n- similarly, whether something can be done to improve the safety and the experience of pedestrians passing under the railway bridge in Langley Park Road\n- possible improvements to the busy junction where Cedar Road crosses Langley Park Road.\nYour views on these issues, and views on any other traffic and parking issues you would like us to look at, are invited.\nThe traffic survey yielded three pieces of data on traffic movements at 17 locations in the part of Sutton South Ward east of Brighton Road. The survey was undertaken in February 2024 over a seven day period Monday to Saturday. The three pieces of data are:\n- the percentage of vehicle traffic that was heavy goods vehicles (HGVs)\n- the average speed of traffic, and\n- the average daily flow of vehicles over the seven day period.\nThe 17 traffic measurement stations are listed here, with the three pieces of data in each direction of the road, in an approximate order from north to south of the Ward, taking roads to the west of the Ward and then listing roads further east.\nKINGS LANE (Southernmost bridge)\nNorth 5.1 / 14.2 / 1350 South 6.7 / 13.9 /1119\nHILLCROOME ROAD\nEast 7.7 / 19.8 /1034 West 4.2 / 18.4 / 808\nLANGLEY PARK ROAD (at the railway bridge)\nNorth 6.9 /21.6 / 3749 South 7.0 / 22,2 / 3059\nBRIGHTON ROAD (at the junction with The Quadrant)\nNorth 8.4 / 17.9 / 6807 South 7.5 / 18.3 / 8508\nBRIGHTON ROAD (just south of the junction with Christchurch Park)\nNorth 8.5 / 25.5 / 8421 South 8.6 / 24.6 / 7599\nCEDAR ROAD (between the junctions with Brighton Road and with Langley Park Road)\nEast 8.3 / 17.8 / 2727 West 7.5 / 18.7 / 1936\nLANGLEY PARK ROAD (just north of the junction with Cavendish Road)\nNorth 5.6 / 22.4 /3034 South 5.8 / 21.3 / 3043\nLANGLEY PARK ROAD (just south of the junction with Chalgrove Road)\nNorth 8.5 / 22.0 / 1697 South 8.2 / 21,0 / 1843\nCAVENDISH ROAD\nEast 9.9 / 19.3 / 648 West 8.7 / 21.2 / 878\nCHRISTCHURCH PARK\nEast 6.0 / 22.2 / 424 West 5.7 / 23,1 / 667\nDEVONSHIRE AVENUE (one way street)\nEast 5.8 / 18.7 / 622\nMAYFIELD ROAD\nNorth 6.8 / 25.0 / 616 South 6.4 / 23.6 / 332\nTHE RIDGWAY (north of junction with Farm Road)\nNorth 6.2 / 24.3 /324 South 5.1 / 24.2 / 349\nTHE RIDGWAY SOUTH and CHALGROVE ROAD\nNorth 5.9 / 25.1 / 571 South 5.9 / 25.1 / 545\nFARM ROAD\nEast 5.0 / 21.2 / 869 West 4.9 / 20.4 / 994\nUPLAND ROAD\nNorth 5.2 / 21.3 / 263 South 11.3 / 25.8 / 293\nDOWNSIDE ROAD\nEast 6.7 / 19.2 / 1089 West 5.9 / 20.8 / 1147\nNEW RESPONSIBILITIES FOR TRISH, RICHARD AND LOUISE\nFollowing the Annual Council Meeting, held on 20 May 2024, where membership of Council committees is decided, Trish, Richard and Louise continue to have important new responsibilities. Louise is continuing for a second year as our Deputy Mayor. Sutton South Councillors have made a major contribution to the Mayoralty, as prior to Louise accepting this role Trish was Mayor of Sutton for three years. Richard was Mayor of Sutton in 2016-17. Louise is now combining this role with being Chair of the Licensing Committee, and is a member of the important Housing, Economy and Business Committee.\nTrish continues as Chair of the important Audit and Governance Committee and is a member of the important Environment and Sustainable Transport Committee. Richard will continue as Chair of the Council’s Planning Committee.\nTHE MUSIC HAS TO STOP AT SPAGHETTI TREE\nOn 14 May a sub-committee of Sutton Council’s Licensing Committee considered a string of complaints by local residents about noise nuisance from the Spaghetti Tree restaurant in Brighton Road. As the restaurant is in our Ward, none of the Ward Councillors could sit as members of the sub-committee, as those taking the decision must be independent from any local influence. The committee considered whether this anti-social behaviour, involving the frequent playing of music at loud volume and thus disturbing local residents, was a breach of the licence conditions for regulated entertainment that governed the operation of the restaurant. The committee was concerned about the disturbance and decided to vary the licence of the restaurant to prevent the playing of live and recorded music as regulated entertainment at the premises. The owner has 21 days to appeal against the decision.\nThis is sad – but the owners of premises must recognise that licence conditions are imposed to protect the local residents and they will be enforced, so they cannot be ignored without there being consequences.\nADVANCES IN OUR WARD\nWe are always seeking ways to improve the quality of life locally. The defibrillator installed in Brighton Road outside Northumberland House, pictured above, is a potentially important facility, but we were disturbed to learn that the one at the railway station a few hundred metres north of this location has been stolen. Action is in hand to replace it.\nMany new street trees have been planted in the Ward including, in the recent period, new trees in Farm Road, Devonshire Avenue, Effingham Close, Prior Avenue and Kayemoor Road, adding to the pleasant, green, suburban feel of our Ward. We are delighted that the tree that had to be felled in Brighton Road, outside Northumberland House, as it was diseased, has been replaced, thanks to funding we obtained from the Council’s Public Realm budget.\nThe fencing in The Quadrant, nearby, which had become damaged has been repaired, also with funding we obtained from the Public Realm budget.\nIn addition, Sutton Council was delighted to be successful in obtaining funding to upgrade rail services to Belmont Station. The funding will allow train services to double from two to four trains per hour and will also facilitate improvements to the station. This will improve transport to the Cancer Hub.\nMORE APPLICATIONS FOR EXTRA STOREYS\nThe owners of Harrow Lodge, 28 Eaton Road, have used a device known as “Prior Approval” to obtain planning permission to extend the building – adding a storey to the top of the building, with some other changes. This will add 10 new flats to the building. In Mulgrave Road the owners of The Rowans, 47 Mulgrave Road, have similarly obtained planning application to add 8 new flats by adding two storeys to the top of the building. This is a current trend – to add extra storeys to the top of blocks of flats.\nThe applicants both used a device in national planning law known as “Prior Approval” which means that Councillors cannot take the application to the Council’s Planning Committee. We consider that this procedure was introduced to undermine the planning system and reduce local control of planning decisions. We are not able to stop these changes taking place as the system means the application has to be assessed by Council officers against a narrow set of criteria and if the application is refused the Planning Inspectorate, based in Bristol, has the power to over-ride local decisions.\nAs your local Councillors, we are concerned about these developments. While there is a need for more accommodation, these changes will involve building work that will impact on residents. However we seek to ensure that conditions are stipulated in any planning permission, if it is granted, to protect the peace and quiet of the residents during construction work. These include that access to the roof should be via an external hoist, the interior of the building should not be a storage area or building site, there should be a construction management plan, the contractors should join the Considerate Contractors’ Scheme, and there should be a liaison officer residents can contact. If scaffolding is erected it should only be erected when needed and removed as soon as it is not needed.\nA similar application for extra storeys on the roof of the building at Chelsea Court in Mulgrave Road was turned down on the basis of our representations that it would have made the building look incongruous.\nWe welcome feedback on your views on planning proposals. You can see the details of and comment on planning applications via the Sutton Council website (go to the section on planning) or comment by post to\nDevelopment Management, Civic Offices, St Nicholas Way, Sutton, SM1 1EA.\nNEW HOMES LOCALLY TO MEET THE HOUSING CRISIS\nOn 30 November Richard and Trish sat as members of the Council’s Planning Committee, with Richard chairing the meeting, to consider the fate of the B and Q site in central Sutton. This is just outside our Ward. B and Q plan to close the store next June. Richard commented that, though he is no do-it-yourself fanatic, he regretted the closure of the store, but B and Q say it no longer makes them money and they have decided to close.\nIt is inevitable that the site will be developed as housing. There is no demand for new office space (more people work at home) or new shops (more people shop using the internet) but there is a housing crisis. On the day of the discussion 970 Sutton families were homeless and living in bed and breakfast accommodation, at the expense of the Council and thus our Council tax payers. More homes are desperately needed. The philosophy in the Sutton local plan is to meet our housing targets partly through a more intensive area of development close to the town centre and near the railway station. As public transport links are good in this area it is possible to envisage a car free or “car light” development – if you have to provide a parking space for every house many fewer homes can be built. This reduces development pressure on the borough’s suburban heartland and Green Belt areas. Planning Committee often considers proposals to build on the Green Belt which we resist, but the new homes must go somewhere. The more intensive development in the town centre will inevitably include some tall buildings, and there is a cluster close to the railway station.\nEvidence was presented to the committee on action taken to deal with some of the consequences of this development, such as a need for places in local schools, demands on health services and additional strain on water and sewage systems. Richard commented that there were attractive features to the proposed development, 60% of which would be open space, including an area of public parkland, a water feature, an amphitheatre and terraced roof gardens. The most important aspect, though, was the plan for 337 “affordable” homes where Sutton Council can place the most deserving of the 2 600 families on the housing register. This will include families that are homeless or those we meet, in our Ward, who are living in dreadful housing circumstances – sometimes families with three or four children living together in tiny flats.\nThe planning application was approved. Initially all that local people will observe is the closure of the store, hoardings put up round the site and the store demolished. Then there will be building work but it will be several years before anyone moves in. Eventually, it will be an attractive, landscaped site. On the website\nthere is a video of a walk through a CGI representation of what the final product will look like.",

This consultation is called the Sutton Link and seeks views on bringing the tram to Sutton, or developing what is called a new Bus Rapid Transport (BRT) route. You can respond to the consultation at\nhttp://www.tfl.gov.uk/sutton-link\nCouncillor Whitehead, the Chair of Sutton Council’s transport liaison committee, and Sutton Council officers will be meeting with TfL London Buses in the New Year to discuss how bus services can be tailored to meet future development proposals in the borough. It will also provide an opportunity to raise any issues related to any shortcomings with existing services. A similar meeting has been held in previous years but Councillor Whitehead tells us a more thorough review of outer London services is now promised by TfL.\nThis is an opportunity to set out views on any changes we would like to see made to services in the area, including changes to frequencies or the duration of services, or route diversions/extensions to provide missing connections.\nOfficers will consider how this information is presented to TfL. However, the final decision on any such changes rests with TfL and there will be limited resources available.\nLocal residents in Sutton South Ward have raised with us the following concerns when consulted in the recent past.\nRoute frequency – although residents have commented that on some routes, such as route 80, frequency and reliability is good, bus 470 is seen as too infrequent, being only about every half hour.\nSimilarly, route S4 could be more frequent.\nA further difficulty with the 470 is that it does not run on a Sunday so our suggestions for the 470 are to increase the frequency from once every half an hour, run it on Sundays and (see below) extend it to Epsom hospital.\nThe X26 bus to Heathrow is used by many and the increased frequency of the X26 is welcome, but the buses have difficulty in keeping to the timetable, perhaps because of the length of the route. Some residents say they would not use it if travelling to Heathrow to catch a plane as it is not 100% reliable. There may thus be a case for increasing the frequency further.\nRoute length – could the 470 go to Epsom hospital rather than Epsom market as there are residents who use it to go to the hospital?\nOn route 151, the frequency and reliability is generally good but the service could be improved if some rush hour buses turned round at North Cheam, bearing in mind that the 213 duplicates the 151 onwards to Worcester Park.\nTimetabling – it is noted that the 80 and 280 buses running northwards along Brighton Road frequently arrive at the same time. Could the timetabling be looked at?\nPassenger information – it has been pointed out that the two bus stops in Mulgrave Road close to Sutton station do not include digital displays on bus arrival information. Although there are other ways of getting this information, on your mobile phone, not all passengers have the skill to get this.\nA review of the information arrangements was suggested for some routes. On route 164, at some stops the bus is recorded as a minute away or due but it does not turn up for six or seven minutes.\nOther matters – There has often been comment on arrangements at Sutton station. A resident suggested that congestion in Mulgrave Roadcould be alleviated by moving the taxi rank. It would be possible to move it to The Quadrant now the side entrance to the station is open, but this would probably be unpopular with the taxi drivers and railway passengers, and was not a proposal pursued under the Sutton Gateway project. A resident also commented that this part of Mulgrave Road has on occasions been briefly flooded during very heavy downpours. I have asked Council engineers to investigate.\nA summary of these comments, by bus route, is:\n470 – increase the frequency from once every half an hour, run it on Sundays and extend it to Epsom hospital\n151 – the service could be improved if some rush hour buses turned round at North Cheam, bearing in mind that the 213 duplicates the 151 onwards to Worcester Park\n80 and 280 – buses running northwards along Brighton Road frequently arrive at the same time so review the timetabling\n164 – review the information arrangements as at some stops the bus is recorded as a minute away or due but it does not turn up for six or seven minutes\nS1 – review the way the timetable is set out on the website\nS4 – review the frequency.\nIt should be noted that while this summary is focussed on suggesting improvements, many residents have commented to us in favourable terms on the frequency and reliability of local bus services.\nWe have put this digest of views forward to officers for consideration. Any decision rests, of course, with Transport for London.",

They both deplored the fact that the building has been empty and derelict for years, but said this should not drive us to accept a thoroughly objectionable proposal.\nRichard quoted the phrase coined by a Conservative Prime Minister of the 1970’s, Edward Heath, no militant socialist, that a particular set of actions he dealt with was “the unacceptable face of capitalism.” He said “What the Committee has before it tonight is exactly that. It is a project that puts profit before people.”\nThe proposal of the developers is to take an existing large building which, for reasons still obscure, has been empty and derelict for years, and renovate it so there are 160 luxury, private, residential apartments. These will in due course be available to be sold or rented for sums of money most of us would find astonishing, but because Sutton remains a thriving area despite the recession (due to the good management of its affairs by its Council) there will be no shortage of demand.\nBut the developer claims that the whole project is so financially marginal that they cannot possibly include any affordable housing atall. This seems unlikely, and the Council’s independent study suggests there is £1.91 million of profit in the proposal over and above what one would regard as a normal and acceptable margin. Some affordable housing can be included without the project becoming unviable.\nHeather and Richard deal with a lot of casework concerning housing in our Ward. They come across many families, often families with small children, that live in desperately overcrowded conditions. There is a massive need for affordable housing in the Britain of 2013. It is a national problem, it is a problem here in Sutton, and it is a problem in a seemingly affluent area like Sutton South Ward.\nRichard said “I do not know why the developer has kept the site empty for so long, as, I am told, it did with the Root and Brown tower in Merton. I deplore the fact that it is an empty and derelict eyesore, a blot on the landscape. Perhaps the expectation was that eventually we would be so fed up with it we would accept anything to get it developed. I am almost at the stage where I would accept anything to get it developed and am at the stage where I would accept almost anything. But not this scheme.”\nThe Committee agreed to support the proposals of the officers to oppose this proposal at the forthcoming hearing by the Planning Inspectorate and seek some affordable housing provision.",
  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_2013_01_14_tackling-the-scourge-of-empty-properties/content_609.html": "People rightly question why, when there is a shortage of accommodation, so many homes are left empty for long periods. Sutton Council has decided to remove the discount people can get on Council tax if a property is empty, and to charge a premium if it is empty for over two years. We think this rightly creates an incentive to keep homes in use rather than empty, and will help with the accommodation shortage in Sutton.\nAt the Sutton Council meeting on 14 January the Council agreed a package of reforms to Council tax arrangements that included this provision. Richard, in his capacity as Lead Councillor on Revenues and Benefits, has been closely involved in work on these proposals, and was specifically thanked for his contribution when the Strategy and Resources Committee agreed to forward his proposals to Council.\nRichard says “When there is such a shortage of homes it is wrong that the system creates an incentive to keep a property empty by giving a discount on Council tax. This change makes the incentives work in the right direction.”",

Hooray.\nA further meeting of the project board guiding the Sutton Gateway project, a board on which Richard represents Sutton South Ward, heard on 25 September that good progress is being made with the scheme.\nThe most important news is that the building work on the side entrance is completed enabling the passageway from The Quadrant to be restored and the side entrance to be opened for passenger use. The side entrance is open from 7am to 7pm.The cycle racks next to the newly opened side entrance have been improved.\nWork at the front of the station commenced in September and will be completed by March 2015, but with no work over the Christmas period to avoid any inconvenience to shoppers. Some of the work will involve traffic diversions.\nThe project’s proposals to further develop the area around Sutton station include:\n– refitted shop fronts, new paving and newly planted trees to improve the look of the area\n– more lighting and CCTV cameras to make the area safer\n– extra cycling facilities, with new bike racks and shelters\n– a town centre clock\n– a new crossing in Brighton Road\n– the opening of the side entrance to Sutton station\n– new “legible London” signs\n– a re-arrangement of the bus stops to reduce congestion\n– an additional crossing for pedestrians outside the station\n– re-design of the Cedar Road / Brighton Road junction to improve visibility for motorists\n– it is not proposed to move the taxi rank, except that after 6.30 some taxis will be able to park immediately opposite the station, with the bus stop opposite the station moved further down Brighton Road and with some buses stopping in Mulgrave Road\n– there will be “live” bus information in Sutton station, subject to further research by Network Rail\n– the timing of the pedestrian crossing at the High Street / Grove Road / Sutton Court Road junction will be amended to give more time to cross\n– the number of parking spaces in the station area will be increased\n– general improvements in design and to the “public realm” around the station, with more flowers, more colour and better signage.\nThe changes, including the changes to the bus stops, will be completed by March 2015.\nThese changes are largely funded by grants the Council has obtained, not local Council tax payers.\nThe results of the earlier consultation exercise on the Gateway Project indicated general support for the scheme, but we were able to make a number of changes to respond to specific issues raised. In our Ward, a particular concern for the businesses was the need for a loading bay on Regents Parade just south of the station. We successfully lobbied for this to be incorporated into the scheme.\nOn 27 February Richard and former Ward Councillor Heather Honour organised a breakfast meeting with local businesses in our Ward to take their views on the Sutton Gateway project. Several joined us in the Rose Café in the Brighton Road, which serves excellent scrambled eggs (Richard’s breakfast). This is right in the area that is to be developed so we were able to chat and walk round the area to see the proposed changes.\nPublic consultation on the emerging proposals ran till 5 March. Consultation was by leaflets in the locality, questionnaires to members of the public, posters, newspaper advertisements, exhibitions, further “stakeholder” meetings and putting information in Sutton station.\nResidents and businesses close to the station were consulted, together with the emergency services and other groups with a major interest such as Network Rail, Southern Rail and TfL.\nAlso of great value will be the “legible London” signs at the station entrance. See the designs at\nhttp://www.tfl.gov.uk/microsites/legible-london/3.aspx\nRichard says “As a local man who for twenty years of my life commuted to central London by a route that meant I walked every working day along Wellesley Road and past the shuttered and barricaded side entrance, to enter the station from the front, it has long been an objective of mine to get the side entrance open. Every second counts when you are a commuter.”",

To ensure a consistent approach throughout the Borough, all local schemes will be drawn into a central strategy and progressed on the basis of an assessment of priorities.\nAn ambitious scheme for the introduction of a 20mph scheme across most of the area of Sutton South Ward west of the Sutton to Belmont railway line has now been included in the “Local Implementation Plan” prepared by Transport for London. This was the subject of proposals put to the local committee in 2015. However, it is on the “reserve list” which means that implementation in the near future is most unlikely.\nA parking scheme for the newly-named Berridge Close is agreed, implementation to coincide with the opening of the adjacent Subsea7 building, as this will lead to more intensive use of the road by those working in the building and accessing the underground car park. Obstructive parking in Berridge Close could lead to problems when the building is occupied, so needs to be avoided. It is proposed that the road will be included in the controlled parking zone with four parking bays in the road, reserved for residents with parking permits. Completion of the building is unlikely before December.\nTraffic and parking schemes were the subject of a session at the December 2015 meeting of the South Sutton, Cheam and Belmont Local Committee, when residents noted down parking and traffic problems. A list of the proposals raised by residents was reported back to the local committee meeting on 10 March.\nIn relation to our own area, the proposals fell into three main categories.\nFirst, concerns about intensive and sometimes obstructive parking in Mayfield Road and roads nearby (The Ridgway, Chalgrove Road, Upland Road).\nSecond, concerns about visibility at the Farm Road / The Ridgway junction.\nThird, a set of other concerns, mostly about speeding at various locations.\nThis listing will form the agenda for further work by the traffic department within a wider cross-Borough study, which is centrally managed by the Council. A number of minor, initial proposals were agreed on 10 March, including to restrict parking at the Prior Avenue / Banstead Road junction due to visibility issues.\nThe question of a parking control scheme in Mayfield Road and the surrounding area was the subject of a consultation exercise by local Councillors last year which showed support in Mayfield Road but not adjacent roads. On 10 March the local committee agreed to devote some of its public realm funds to fund the traffic department to “kick start” a study of potential for parking controls in this area. A discussion between traffic engineers and Ward Councillors to consider this study was held on 8 June in Mayfield Road. The traffic engineers will design a parking control scheme for consultation. The precise parameters of this scheme and the consultation have yet to be finalised. Consultation with residents is due to begin in January 2017.\nSome residents of Audley Place have commented to us that there is difficulty when driving out of Audley Place in seeing vehicles coming down Camborne Road, if cars are parked close to the corner. We raised this issue with traffic engineers and the Council is proposing a small extension of the yellow lines on each side at the exit from Audley Place. We think this will do the trick in terms of making it easier, and safer, to drive out into Camborne Road.\nResidents of Tapestry Close have complained to us about obstructive parking in the Close. We raised this issue with traffic engineers and a scheme of yellow lining was proposed. Further consultation with residents, required by law, found some residents objecting and this scheme is currently on hold.\nSeveral schemes consulted on some time ago have now been implemented, including yellow lining at the bottom of Downside Road to deal with obstructive parking (see photo above) and switching some “pay and display” bays to “dual use” so residents with parking permits can use them, in Grange Road and Langley Park Road.",
  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_2021_02_11_news-on-traffic-schemes/content_423.html": "The Council has been taking legal advice on a recent High Court judgement against the Mayor of London which indicated that London Boroughs were misdirected and should not have been prevented from consulting in advance of implementing the “low traffic neighbourhoods schemes” introduced across London last autumn. Last year, the Mayor and the Conservative Government required Councils to move at pace to introduce these schemes and only consult after the measures were in place. We told them at the time that this was a mistake. We have been proven right.\nSutton Council has concluded that in the light of the legal case all schemes have to be removed. We are disappointed as some schemes were working well, but we have no choice given the legal judgement. We are angry at Transport for London, who required introduction of the schemes without consultation but were so inattentive to the legal requirements that they left themselves open to legal challenge. The result is the withdrawal of the schemes.\nIn our Ward this affects three interventions, all of which were six month trials – the “school street” at Overton Grange school (to close the road to traffic for a short period as students arrive and leave to create a more peaceful and safe environment at the start and end of the school day), the 20 mph speed limit in roads east of Mayfield Road, and the closure of Kings Lane. The legal case means all three will have to be discontinued.\nOf these interventions, the 20 mph limit was supported by residents in the Council’s “Streetspace” consultation, and we are pursuing how it might be restored in due course. This is not the end of the process. We remain committed to reducing traffic and pollution on residential roads and would very much welcome your views and suggestions. Drop us an email.\nWe will keep residents advised concerning future action. Stories that have been put round about other, new, road closures have no foundation.",

You can view these on their website.\nTheir final decisions leave the Ward much as it was, with the addition of a part of Mulgrave Road. The new structure they outline will be the structure of Wards at the next Council elections in 2022. The new Ward will be one of the largest Wards in the borough.\nCurrently the Ward runs from Sutton station in the north to Devonshire Road in the south, and Banstead Road South in the east to Overton Road in the west. It is mostly a Ward of residential roads with three schools (Devonshire Avenue primary, Overton Grange, Eagle House school), one small park (the Devonshire Avenue Nature Area), three places of worship (Christchurch, the Friends’ Meeting House, the synagogue in Cedar Road), split into three parts by Langley Park Road and Brighton Road running north-south.\nThe draft proposals published earlier this year removed from the Ward roads east of Upland Road – Kaymoor, Willis, Prior, Downside, Farm Close – and put them into Carshalton Beeches Ward. There were minor adjustments at the western end so the whole Ward moved westwards.\nIn drawing up new boundaries, the Commission is required to aim to deliver electoral equality for voters in Council elections so that each Councillor represents roughly the same number of voters. The review also aimed to ensure that the new Council wards reflect, as far as possible, the interests and identities of communities across Sutton.\nThe final proposals leave the Ward much as it was, with the addition of a small part of Mulgrave Road. The new Ward will be one of the largest Wards in the borough.\nAfter a debate on 14 October Sutton Council submitted some proposals. Richard spoke in this debate, commenting in particular on the proposals fro Sutton South Ward. He said:\n“I recognise that there is always a tension between drawing lines on maps that create sensible geographical structures in terms of communities and natural boundaries and getting the numbers right in terms of residents per Councillor. I would like to stress that where these create tensions I think it important to give priority to getting the boundaries right, creating areas that residents recognise as communities, in particular respecting natural boundaries such as main roads and railway lines, and keeping recognised communities together, and this should be the priority even if it does lead to some unevenness in Ward sizes. In any exercise like this there will inevitably be some disparity in the size of Wards with some outliers.”",
  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_page_3/content_122.html": "On 21 September Richard attended a “Community Walkabout” organised by Sutton Housing Partnership (SHP) at Kingslee Court and Thorn Court in Worcester Road. These events are organised to provide an opportunity for residents to raise issues of concern with SHP staff. SHP’s Chief Executive and senior SHP staff attended. A high proportion of the residents are leaseholders and many took part. The residents said they appreciated the recent re-location of the refuse bins and the re-painting of the entrance gate. Some “snagging” arising from the recent renovation work on the buildings was noted and various other concerns of the residents explored.\nOn 19 October all three Councillors attended similar “Community Walkabouts” at Sutton Court and at Beauclere House, in Brighton Road. These were again well attended by residents. A wide variety of issues were raised including the use of the garages, parking, dealing with anti-social behaviour and lighting. These exercises were thought to have been very useful by those who took part. The photo shows the group at Kingslee Court.\nThe owner of Chelsea Court, 54 Mulgrave Road has had planning permission to extend the building – in effect adding two extra floors to the block of flats – refused by Sutton Council. This was the latest in a series of applications in our Ward where owners of blocks of flats have sought to extend the building upwards.\nAs local Councillors, we were concerned about these proposals. While there is a need for more accommodation, the changes to the building would in our view make it look incongruous, not good enough for Sutton. The block is an attractive architect-designed building (see photo), one of the more attractive blocks in Mulgrave Road, and the proposed changes would destroy the symmetry of the building. The Planning Department at Sutton Council agreed with our objections. The changes would also have involved building work that would greatly disturb the current residents of the block.\nThe owners used a mechanism called “prior approval” when submitting their planning application. This mechanism, in our view, was introduced by the Government to undermine the planning system. As a result, we could take the application to the Council’s Planning Committee, which Richard chairs, for decision by Councillors. We may still not be able to stop these changes taking place given the powers of the remote Planning Inspectorate based in Bristol to over-ride local decisions.\nWe always seek to ensure in such cases that a number of conditions are stipulated in any planning permission, if one is ever granted, to try to protect the peace and quiet of the building during construction work. These include that access to the roof should be via an external hoist with all materials for work on the roof transported to the roof by an external hoist and not brought up via the well of the building. The interior of the building should not be a storage area or building site. There should be a construction management plan to minimize disruption to existing residents and ensure there are controls on dust and noise, and on hours of work. The contractors should join the Considerate Contractors’ Scheme. There should be a liaison officer that residents can contact if they observe poor behaviour. If scaffolding is erected outside residents’ windows it should only be erected when needed and removed as soon as it is not needed.\nWe have successfully opposed this development but wait to see if the developer will appeal to the Planning Inspectorate against the decision of the Council.\nLouise, Richard and Trish travelled to City Hall, the HQ of London Mayor Sadiq Khan, on 30 June to join other Sutton Liberal Democrat Councillors in presenting a petition to the Mayor. The petition, signed by over 10 000 Sutton residents, expressed our opposition to the extension of the ULEZ zone to outer London boroughs. Our views on why we opposed the extension of ULEZ can be found in posts further down this site.\nDespite our opposition, ULEZ has now been extended by the London Mayor to outer London.\nWe are again involved in arguments over proposals to add extra storeys the top of Northumberland House.\nNorthumberland House is the tower block at the corner of Brighton Road and Wellesley Road, about 200 yards along Brighton Road if you turn left when coming out of Sutton station.\nCriterion Capital, the owners of Northumberland House, are again seeking planning permission to add two storeys to the top of the building. The owners are again seeking to extend the building, creating a further 29 flats by adding two extra storeys on the top of the ten storey part of the building and an extra storey on the lower part, with some additional flats in the “undercroft” above the parking area. Some of the current parking spaces would be lost.\nAn earlier similar application was not supported by Sutton Council on the basis of design of the proposed tower extension and issues about the alignment of the windows. Planning law allows developers to seek to over-ride the decisions of local Councillors by appealing to the remote Bristol-based Planning Inspectorate, whose decision is final. The developers went to appeal, to the Planning Inspectorate, and on 5 October Richard and Louise attended and spoke on behalf of residents at a hearing organised by the Planning Inspectorate.\nWe had noted that there would be some positives, such as the creation of a community amenity and play space on the tarmaced area at ground floor level. However, while there is a shortage of accommodation in London and more housing is needed, we were concerned that the building work had the potential to be extremely disruptive to the lives of current residents. And an extra two storeys on the top of the building looks incongruous and out of keeping with the design of the rest of the building. Richard told the Inspector the design “looked like a couple of portacabins had been dumped on the top of the building.” At the hearing we told the Planning Inspector that residents of Northumberland House are concerned about the likely disruption involved in this proposed work, and have long standing concerns about frequent lift breakdowns in the building and the general standard of housekeeping, particularly in the bin area. We pressed the Inspector to impose conditions, if he were to agree to the scheme, to protect the interests of residents, and include these conditions in any planning permission they eventually obtained. We asked that access to the roof areas would be only by external hoists, and that the peace and quiet of the interior of the building would not be disturbed or the interior turned into a storage area, or building site. We sought controls on scaffolding to ensure any scaffolding that is required is removed as soon as the requirement has passed. We insisted there must be a construction management plan to control hours of work and control noise and dust nuisance. We asked that the contractor joins the “Considerate Contractors Scheme”, which provides a route for residents to raise concerns if they observe poor behaviour. We were pleased that the developers indicated they would accept all these conditions.\nThe Inspector supported our views and commented that the proposed building looks “incongruous” – the exact wording Richard had used at the hearing. He turned down the application and also refused the application for costs.\nThe owners have now submitted a further, similar application. Residents can see the proposals via the Council’s website (go to the section on planning and follow leads to get to comment on planning applications). It is application DM2023/00796. We are keen to learn of the views of residents on this matter, particularly those who live in Northumberland House. Do contact us at the email addresses given in the first post on this site.\nThis picture shows Louise and Trish cleaning off the graffiti we found in the area outside Northumberland House in Brighton Road. We want residents to report to us instances of graffiti, which is one of the scourges of our times, worldwide. In general, the Council has a good record in cleaning off graffiti quickly. A difficulty is when the graffiti is on private property and the owners of the property have responsibility.\nHere is an example of graffiti we got cleaned off, on the bridge at Kings Lane.\nIn support of our policies to combat global warming and reduce carbon emissions, the programme to fit electric vehicle charging points in lampposts in our Ward continues. A further consultation exercise is about to take place on the installation of two new electric vehicle charging points in Mulgrave Road, close to the junction with Worcester Road. A preliminary consultation found majority support but few residents responded.\nThere are now charging points at the following locations:\nOpposite 49 The Ridgway\nOpposite 26 Langley Park Road\nOpposite Foxley Court in Christchurch Park\nOpposite 10 Cumnor Road\nIn Cedar Gardens\nOpposite Grange Court, Grange Road\nOpposite Thomas House, Grange Road\nOpposite 13 Stanley Road\nOpposite Fairford Court, Stanley Road\nWe want to draw attention to the Sutton Citizen space survey where residents should log their suggestions for EV charge points.\nThe photo shows the first vehicle that used the first charging point in the Ward, in The Ridgway. Given the policy to ultimately phase out petrol driven vehicles, a big and continuing expansion will be needed.\nSutton Council is working with Siemens to install Ubitricity lamp column electric vehicle charging points. Ubitricity lamp column charging points are compact and fit into the door of a lamp column. The aim of lamp column charging is to give residents the ability to easily charge electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles on the street where they live, especially if they do not have off-street parking or are unable to install their own home charging point. Installing residential charging points is important because a key barrier to people switching to electric vehicles is the concern around where they will be able to charge their vehicle.\nNot all lamp columns are suitable for lamp column charging points. The lamp columns need to be “electrically suitable”, be positioned near the kerb and have enough internal space to fit the charging point. They need to be sensibly located so that a vehicle could safely park and charge next to the lamp column. The lamp columns also need to be made of metal, not concrete.\nAn “earth mat”, a small metal grid, is also installed in the footway next to the lamp column. This is to make the charging point “electrically safe” if there is a fault. There are signs to indicate that the lamp column has a charging point fitted, though this sign will not prevent non-electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles from parking next to the lamp column.\nThis is a major advance in our drive to promote electric vehicles and combat global warming.\nOn 22 May Louise was elected as Deputy Mayor of the London Borough of Sutton. Louise was elected to Sutton Council, joining Trish and Richard as Councillors for Sutton South Ward, on 5 May 2022. Louise – Louise Phelan – has lived in Sutton for over 20 years and her son Harry, who will be officially titled her “Consort” as Deputy Mayor, attends Overton Grange school in our Ward. She is an active member of many local community organisations and was a leading member of the Sutton New Town Community Festival, serving as chair of the organisation. Harry is a member of Sutton Police Cadets.\nThe Coronation weekend saw a rash of street parties throughout Sutton South Ward, though there were fewer than there had been for the Platinum Jubilee celebrations last June. Louise, Trish and Richard dropped in at some of the parties, including the street party in Prior Avenue, which was a more modest affair than their Jubilee street party last summer. Richard also dropped in at the Highfield Residents’ Association event.\nOur Mayor and the two other Ward Councillors at the Effingham Close street party last June.\nThe three Sutton South Councillors are united in opposing the extension of ULEZ to Sutton. While everyone is concerned about air quality, it will have a detrimental effect on so many of our residents, particularly those who run businesses or depend on using a car to get to work or to see family. At the Sutton Council meeting on 24 April we debated ULEZ. This is the speech Louise made.\n“So ULEZ… I don’t have a car and I don’t drive, so it won’t affect me…\nOnly, actually it will…\nYou see, as I don’t have a car I have to rely on people that do, and many of the people I know do not have ULEZ compliant vehicles…\nI rely on\nThe friend that’s taken me and my son on days out to places that we wouldn’t be able to get to by public transport,\nThe neighbour that’s taken me and my son Christmas shopping so we didn’t have to carry everything on a long bus journey,\nThe friend that’s picked me and my son up from hospital when my son was taken in for an emergency,\nThe friend who has moved furniture for me in his van.\nThe family and friends that come and visit me from outside the borough.\nThis is just a tiny snapshot of the people who I and people like me depend on who will have to change their vehicles because of the ULEZ, but these people are all going to struggle to replace those cars or vans because they are already wrestling with the after effects of COVID and the cost of living crisis. Public transport isn’t currently an alternative in Sutton, it’s too expensive, too infrequent and too patchy throughout the borough.\nDon’t get me wrong, I live on a busy cut through road and would appreciate cleaner air and all the health benefits, but the effects on the quality of life and opportunities for me and my son are just too great. This will leave so many people like me without that extra help they need and rely on, they will find it harder to work, socialise and access healthcare and become even more isolated than before.\nSo you can see, this doesn’t just affect a small amount of vehicles as the Mayor of London claims in his now withdrawn advert, the knock on effect if this is brought in its current form will actually affect a much wider community of people whose lifelines will be cut. “",

This will add 10 new flats to the building. In Mulgrave Road the owners of The Rowans, 47 Mulgrave Road, have similarly obtained planning application to add 8 new flats by adding two storeys to the top of the building. This is a current trend – to add extra storeys to the top of blocks of flats.\nThe applicants both used a device in national planning law known as “Prior Approval” which means that Councillors cannot take the application to the Council’s Planning Committee. We consider that this procedure was introduced to undermine the planning system and reduce local control of planning decisions. We are not able to stop these changes taking place as the system means the application has to be assessed by Council officers against a narrow set of criteria and if the application is refused the Planning Inspectorate, based in Bristol, has the power to over-ride local decisions.\nAs your local Councillors, we are concerned about these developments.

This picture shows Sutherland House – it is hoped that the seat outside Sutherland House can be restored if the problems associated with public drinking in this area can be dealt with ]\nSutton Council has extended what is popularly called the “No Drinking” zone to our Ward.\nEven before we were elected, we were aware of the concerns of local residents and the problems of anti-social behaviour associated with a group of what are sometimes called “all day drinkers”. These people often congregated at the Brighton Road / Cedar Road intersection.\nFollowing a number of discussions that we, as Ward Councillors, had with the Council Executive member responsible for public order matters, Councillor Graham Tope, the Council has taken steps in a policy direction that we have advocated, to deal with the problem.\nAt present, the town centre in Sutton is a “Designated Public Place” – popularly called a “No Drinking” zone. An effect is that the group of people who drink on the street for much of the day congregated just outside the zone, in particular at the street corner at the end of Cedar Road where it meets the Brighton Road. This is close to Forest Dene Court, a large block of flats for elderly people, some of whom have expressed to us their concern about this group of drinkers. Now, the Council has extended the zone to cover an area of Sutton South Ward.\nThe area covered is a square bordered by Cedar Road, Langley Park Road, Egmont Road and the Brighton Road. The police were able to provide evidence of anti-social behaviour associated with drinking to justify including this area in the zone. Now the zone is extended to this area, the police will monitor the effect. If the problem is simply displaced to a different area, consideration can be given to a further extension.\nThe legal effect of the Designated Public Places Order is that if someone is drinking alcohol in public in this area the police can ask them to stop. If they do not stop, they are guilty of an offence.\nThe designation of the Sutton South zone was subject to public consultation. Statutory notices were placed in newspapers and on relevant websites on 11 January. Representations could be made during the consultation period, which ended on 7 February. A second statutory notice was published. The order came into force on 15 March 2011.\nAs your local Councillors, we are delighted with these developments, which we have pressed for, with the Council. We have had the support of the local police and the Sutton South police consultative committee (whose activities are reported elsewhere on this website, on the page on police matters). As a result of this development the police will be able to spend less time dealing with the anti-social behaviour associated with public drinking and spend more time on their two other priorities for our Ward, car crime and drug dealing.\nWhen the results of the new measures are clear, we hope it will then be possible to restore the seat outside Sutherland House, which was removed as it became associated with public order problems caused by this group of people.",
  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_category_news_page_35/content_614.html": "Richard, with Councillor Simon Wales, presents the Thameslink petition signed by Sutton South residents at the HQ of the Department for Transport\nAs so many Sutton South residents commute into London to work every day, and we value our direct connections to St. Pancras, the loss of our cross-London train services, if the Thameslink / Capital Connect services terminate at Blackfriars, will be a blow to local people.\nOn 23 August Richard joined Councillor Simon Wales, together with Liberal Democrat activists from neighbouring Boroughs, to present our petition to the Department for Transport at their Head Office in Marsham Street, Westminster. The petiton called on the Department to put a stop to these proposals.\nSeptember 15 is the deadline to comment on the Department for Transport’s consultation document making this proposal, following a decision by the DfT to extend the consultation period. The link to their consultation document is\nHERE. You can email comments to\nThameslink@dft.gsi.gov.uk\nBelow is our own submission.\nResponse to the Department for Transport Combined Thameslink Franchise Consultation\nFrom Councillor Richard Clifton and Councillor Heather Honour, Liberal Democrat Councillors for Sutton South, London Borough of Sutton\n1. We are the elected Liberal Democrat Councillors for Sutton South Ward, which is just south of Sutton railway station. Passengers leaving Sutton station to the south, by the side entrance (when it is open), pass into Sutton South Ward as they leave the station.\n2. Our Ward is almost entirely residential and a significant number of our residents commute daily into central London for work. Many of these commuters use trains on the Thameslink Loop Line to travel to stations north of Blackfriars, including Farringdon and St. Pancras. Residents of the Ward also tell us they consider they benefit greatly from having a direct service to St. Pancras International, for Continental Europe, and Luton airport.\n3. For that reason we are concerned at the proposal, first set out in the London and South East Route Utilisation Strategy (July 2011), that all Sutton / Wimbledon Thameslink Loop Line trains will terminate at London Blackfriars from 2018.\n4. Terminating Wimbledon Loop services at Blackfriars would result in our residents losing their cross-London service. This will penalise those of our residents who have made their residential, employment and educational location decisions on the basis of the existence of the cross-London Thameslink service. These residents, who chose to live in Sutton South on the basis of an existing pattern of transport connections, would lose a service that they have had for many years, and based their life around.\n5. Any decision should take account of the impact of changes on the travel patterns of existing passengers, and of consequent requirements to change established travel patterns. It is because of the impact on our residents that we object to any proposal that would result in terminating Wimbledon loop trains at Blackfriars.\n6. Not only would our residents lose a through service they have come to depend on, they would lose their connection with Eurostar and domestic long distance trains at St. Pancras International and Kings Cross. Instead they would have to change trains at Blackfriars, carrying possibly heavy luggage onto already crowded trains. This movement could be particularly difficult from the western bay platform when travelling north and to either bay platform when travelling south because of the platform lengths and the position of lifts and stairs at each end of the platforms. The recent Passenger Focus passenger survey found that having to change trains was a strong disincentive to train travel.\n7. Sutton is identified in the London Plan as one of only four Metropolitan town centres in south London , with a large and growing population and employment base. It is a major business centre with many commuters and business travellers. It is therefore essential that Sutton, as a strategic south London destination, retains its connections to central and north London and beyond, and maintains its direct link to St. Pancras and the City.\n8. We also believe that the attractiveness of Sutton to employers considering re-location away from expensive offices in central London would be affected. Sutton is a location from which one can travel to Brussels with just two train journeys, one taking 45 minutes and one two hours, and the journey to Paris is only fifteen minutes longer. We have been successful in attracting businesses to Sutton and this change would have a negative impact, particularly given the expected mushrooming of international train travel from St. Pancras over the next few years. These negative effects would impact on the residents of our Ward who want to work locally in Sutton.\n9. We thus strongly object to any proposal that would result in terminating Wimbledon loop trains at Blackfriars from 2018.\n10. We are aware that Sutton Council is submitting comments, and support those comments. However, we are making this submission to draw particular attention to the impact on our residents in Sutton South Ward.\nRICHARD CLIFTON\nHEATHER HONOUR\nLiberal Democrat Councillors for Sutton South, London Borough of Sutton",

  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_category_local-council_page_5/content_243.html": "At last some positive news on what is happening to Sutherland House, the empty building just south of the railway station in Brighton Road on the corner with Cedar Road.\nThis building has been empty far too long but we now have confirmation from the owners, Criterion Capital, that the work is well under way to renovate the building. The renovation will convert the building to 128 luxury flats with car parking spaces, one per flat.\nThey expect the work to be finished by March 2016. They will be appointing local estate agents to act for them to offer the flats for rent. We are a little surprised that they are to be offered for rent rather than sale, but given the location close to the station there will be no shortage of demand. We doubt if they will be actively marketing the flats until the work is sufficiently progressed for them to have a show flat for people to look at, but they say the work will be to a high standard.\nWe have been critical of the developers as they used a route to bypass normal planning permission requirements, but at last work is under way and we have a date by which the building will be occupied. The year 2016 will be a good one for the area with the occupation of the Subsea7 building and Sutherland House, bringing people into the area who will spend money in local shops and restaurants, which will give the whole area an uplift.\nThe argument over the future of Sutherland House was the subject of a letter from Richard published by The Guardian (the national paper, not the Sutton Guardian) on 5 February. Here is the text:\n“Sir\nCongratulations to The Guardian for exposing the loss of affordable housing that has resulted from the Government’s successive changes to planning law.\nThe latest changes are in a series that have progressively created major loopholes to excuse developers from providing affordable housing. Just south of Sutton station, in south London, there is an office building, empty for some years, which the developers propose to convert to 128 luxury flats. The day before Sutton Council’s Planning Committee was to approve the scheme, which included a significant number of affordable homes, the developers withdrew the scheme. They had spotted the advantages to them if they followed a newly-created route called “prior approval” that has now forced the Council to accept the application with zero affordable homes included.\nOn one calculation, our Borough may have lost up to 500 affordable homes due to that legislation. The latest changes you highlight are further steps on a path that is seriously undermining the efforts of local authorities to help those in dire need of better housing.\nCouncillor Richard Clifton, Chair of Planning Committee, London Borough of Sutton”\nAt the meeting of Sutton Council on 19 January Richard criticised the owners of Sutherland House for their “inertia” in relation to the re-development of the empty building.\nRichard joined with Sutton Councillor Hanna Zuchowska in pointing out that the owners withdrew an application for planning permission that included an element of affordable housing before exploiting recent changes in planning law to get permission for conversion of the building to 128 luxury flats with no affordable housing element. But still, although the building has been empty for five years, they do not get on with the re-development.\nSpeaking after the meeting Richard said “The building is still empty and a blot on the landscape. The development of the Subsea7 building, bringing 800 office jobs to the area, and the improvements associated with the Sutton Gateway project, are giving a lift to the area just south of Sutton station. We need the developers to get on with the renovation of Sutherland House.”\nThe full text of Richard’s speech, seconding a motion on affordable housing, is as follows:\n“In seconding this motion, I would like to draw attention to the opening sentence, which speaks of the widening gap between the rich and the poor.\nI find it astonishing that in my own lifetime the wealth gap between rich and poor has not just failed to diminish but has actually widened.\nThe figures are so astounding one hardly believes them – that the top 80 (eight zero) wealthiest individuals in the world own more than half the world’s wealth, that is they own as much as half the population of the planet.\nAnd in our own country about 30 billionaires own half the wealth of the nation.\nAnd the implications of this inequality are not just a matter of concern for social policy.\nA fascinating study published by the OECD last December showed that countries with a smaller and narrowing gap between rich and poor experienced higher rates of economic growth, and if the gap between rich and poor had not widened in Britain from the 1980’s the UK economy would in fact be 20% larger.\nGeorge Osborne ought to reflect on the reasons for this. If you increase the earnings of the poor they will spend it, creating income, jobs and wealth for others, but if you increase the earnings of the rich they may save much of it. He ought to remember this when he plans yet further raids on the welfare budget, on financial support to the very poorest in society, rather than asking the wealthy to contribute more.\nIt is a finding that demonstrates that the so-called “trickledown” economics so beloved of leaders on the right of the political spectrum – and that included Margaret Thatcher – whereby largesse afforded to the very rich trickled down to help the very poor, was in fact a recipe for lower growth and thus a lower increase in living standards for all.\nWe need concerted policy action to deal with this, and tax rates on the highest earners, property taxes, the minimum wage, and welfare support to the very poor, are all important aspects. But we all know that action and support for those in need can be best targeted if undertaken at a local level.\nHere in Sutton, we will continue to do what we can to build a fairer and more equal society, something of particular importance to us as Liberal Democrats, even if what we can do is sometimes at the most basic level, such as dealing with concerns about food and housing.\nAnd the fact that we have Food Banks, here in Britain, in one of the more affluent countries in the world, makes my point about inequality more eloquently than any of my words can do.\nOn housing, we can be proud of our record in Sutton.\nAs Councillor McCoy told us, the Council is promoting affordable housing, something that is vital when I find that in my own Ward changes to planning law mean that a block like Sutherland House can become 128 luxury flats with no affordable housing requirement atall. If and when the developers finally get on with it, and I deplore their inertia.\nAnd the Council is dealing with homelessness: I was heartened by the serious and concerned tone of the debate at Planning Committee on the proposal to provide short-term accommodation for homeless families in Benhill Road. It was the Committee at its best. This was on an evening – 17 December 2014 – when no less than 76 (seven six) Sutton families were homeless and in bed and breakfast accommodation, often miles from Sutton.\nMr. Mayor, we must continue our efforts as a Council to care for the most needy of our residents, while having a concern – as citizens – to promote policies, at every level, that will increase economic growth but distribute the rewards more fairly.\nI am pleased to second the motion.”",
  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_2011_10_18_765/content_102.html": "Richard and Heather were involved in initiating a debate on planning policy at the Sutton Council meeting on 17 October. Richard wanted to welcome some aspects of proposals for a National Planning Policy Framework while drawing attention to a number of problems involved in the planning system that have affected Sutton South Ward – the permissive nature of permitted development rights, the inconsistent decisions of the Planning Inspectorate and the slowness of the system, which does not help maintain public confidence.\nThe full text of Richard’s speech is as follows.\n“I would like to support the motion’s cautious welcome for the National Planning Policy Framework, as a set of planning policies that respect a localist agenda,\nwhile at the same time expressing our concern that there are some aspects of the direction of policy that we still need to work on to get them right.\nI believe that the planning system, as it operates in Sutton, has worked well to protect the interests of the community.\nWe have in particular, over many years, adopted a strong policy to protect backgardens and control backgarden development. There are two important aspects to this:\n– we have adopted planning policies that carefully control what types of backgarden development might get planning permission, and even this year have strengthened that policy with amendments to planning policy DM30 to ensure that aspects of character, appearance and amenity are fully considered: and\n– we have devoted significant resources to ensuring planning requirements are strongly enforced.\nTo this end, every site where an infringement of planning law is alleged is visited and the enforcement staff work carefully through the processes required by law to get any breach corrected.\nI am impressed by the statistic that in the last year the enforcement team have met their target times for early site visits in 97% of cases.\nThe processes they follow are, because of planning law, sometimes slow – but every case is doggedly pursued to its conclusion.\nThis policy, however, comes under pressure from several sources that we cannot as a Council control.\nFirst, from the legal requirements concerning what is permitted development.\nI think the reforms of 2008 took out of the planning system buildings that really ought to be within it.\nI was surprised recently when, in my Ward, a large building was built in a back garden but found – due to the dimensions and overall size of the plot, and its planned use – to be permitted development, though it has certainly affected the amenity of neighbours, some of whom are here tonight. We must be on guard against any further relaxation of permitted development law.\nIn taking forward the National Planning Policy Framework, none of us would want to see rights of permitted development widened still further, and a key point in the motion is the statement that extending permitted development rights further will reduce rather than enhance the power of the community to stop inappropriate changes.\nI am therefore delighted that the amendment to the motion calls for a full review of permitted development law.\nSecond, there are the decisions of the Planning Inspectorate – not mentioned in the motion, but I cannot let pass the opportunity to say their decisions are less consistent than I would have expected – and indeed some of their decisions have done real damage in my Ward.\nThird, the legal processes do not help. They provide those who breach planning law with myriad opportunities for appeals and delay, all of us have examples from our own Wards. And at the end of the process we sometimes face the seeming lethargy of the Courts in dealing with such breaches. All of this hinders our strong enforcement efforts and leads to a public perception that things take a long time, which affects public confidence in the planning system.\nThese are all factors we cannot control, but we must take every opportunity to make representations to seek their amelioration – and this motion is a part of that campaign.\nSo – a cautious welcome for the National Planning Policy Framework, recognising that this is a policy area central to our efforts to maintain the pleasant environment of our Borough. It is right that we should intervene in this national debate to make clear to all our determination to be able to continue those efforts to cherish and protect the green and pleasant character of Sutton.”",

Some trees are found to be diseased and a few have to be felled, but will be replaced.\nWhen the trees are pruned they look bare, but the foliage will re-grow next year.\nIt is believed that Sutton has more street trees per yard of pavement than any other of the 32 London boroughs, with over 20 000 trees across the borough and over a thousand in our Ward. This leads, every autumn, to a big job collecting up the leaves. There is a schedule for collecting them, but the speed of doing this is directly related to the resources devoted to it. Tory Government cuts to Council funding have not helped.",

We also hope to see many of you at the Environmental Fair on the August Bank Holiday in Carshalton Park.\nChildren and Family Activities\nTake up the Reading Challenge with your local library and make sure your child or children’s reading doesn’t dip over the summer. Sutton Library will also be organising a range of reading events and the Phoenix Centre a range of craft and leisure activities.\nSutton Ecology Centre will be running nature classes for families and children, including how to become a camouflage expert (some fees apply). Kickz, cake decorating and street dancing are just some of the range of activities being put on at the Sutton Life Centre.\nThe Honey wood Museum will be hosting crafty activities throughout the holidays, as well as a puppet-making course and a Wild About Wildlife afternoon.\nThe new Westcroft leisure centre will be running a summer school in tandem with ‘fit for sport’ throughout August for all children, ages 5-12. Carshalton Athletic is also running football training camps for all abilities from ages 4-11. While The David Weir Centre is also offering professional sports coaching for those aged 5-15.\nIn the Capital\nRide London will see cycling events taking place in London and Surrey between Aug 1-4th. The Scoop next to City Hall will be hosting a range of free events throughout the summer. Why not take advantage of the wide range of London’s excellent museums.\nThe start of September will see The Mayor’s Thames Festival return to the capital to celebrate London’s iconic river through art, music, and educational events both on the water and along its banks and bridges.\nHeather and Richard",

Use the “Report a Problem” button on the website or email us at the address given on the banner at the top of the website.\nDuring the period of cold weather and snowfall, we were contacted by many people in the Ward seeking assistance.\nWe were contacted by a resident in Rutherford Close who commented on the icy state of the pavements in Rutherford Close and in Cumnor Road, as they had to walk the length of Cumnor Road to get a bus in Langley Park Road. We contacted the gritting team who left a pile of grit at each end of Cumnor Road. We went round to Cumnor Road and ourselves distributed grit along the pavements, including gritting the road at the Cumnor Road / Rutherford Close intersection, a part of Wellesley Road and most of Rutherford Close. We were assisted by Courtney and Curtis Sampson of Cumnor Road, to whom we extend thanks.\nThe Council does not have the resources to clear or grit all the pavements in the Borough. After each fall of snow priority is given to pavements outside hospitals, GP surgeries and schools, and care homes. Responding to requests we made, the pavement outside Fiske Court (a large care home in Cavendish Road) was partly cleared, and Councillor Clifton himself cleared a further stretch of the pavement, in response to a request from a resident. It is worth noting that, if there is more snow before the winter ends, if people clear a path outside their own house it will dry off during the periods of thaw when the temperature gets above freezing, and this will leave the pavement clear of ice. Which is why we encourage people to do this.\nThe new grit bins in the Ward have been of value but were rapidly emptied. The gritting teams are continuing to fill them up but they are emptied again almost as soon as they are filled. Which, of course, means they are being used for their intended purpose. Most of the bins in the Ward were re-filled in the period immediately after Christmas.\nResidents of Downside Road have commented to us that the new bin, installed at the request of Councilor Clifton, in the middle of the hill, outside number 31, has been of great value and helped them keep the road open during the snow. This supplements the bins at the top and bottom of the hill.",

She is an active member of many local community organisations and was a leading member of the Sutton New Town Community Festival, serving as chair of the organisation.\nTRISH says “I have lived in Sutton for over 30 years and my daughters Alexandra and Lauren were born in St. Helier hospital.\nI am passionate about education. My younger daughter attended St. Philomena’s where I fund raised with the Parents’ Association. She is now at Uni. My elder daughter is a dentist.\nI worked in the insurance industry for 30 years and now run my own business. I hope to put that experience to good use in encouraging small businesses.”\nRICHARD says\n“I have lived in Sutton South Ward for over thirty years so have a good understanding of the area and of the opportunities and problems of living here. I think it a wonderful place to live and I am so grateful to my fellow citizens in Sutton South for giving me this opportunity for public service, by electing me as a Councillor for the area I live in and really love.\nI was active in politics in the 1960’s, when I was President of the Union of Students at the University of Warwick. Those who have read the book “Warwick University Limited” by E.P. Thompson will know that at that time Warwick was a hotbed of radical ideas. I was for many years a member of the Labour Party but joined the SDP (Social Democratic Party) when it was formed in the 1980’s and, by that route, joined the Liberal Democrats when the former Liberal party merged with the SDP. The formation of the SDP came at a point when the Labour Party had moved sharply to the left and lost its internationalist outlook. Something similar happened to the Labour Party under the leadership of Corbyn. For those in the Labour Party looking for a progressive, social democratic alternative, the SDP never went away. It is still there merged in the Liberal Democrats. The LibDems are, today, the natural home for progressive social democrats.\nI have been married to Gloria, who was a museum curator and Head of the Royal Observatory in Greenwich until she retired, for 50 years this year. Gloria is now a Curator Emeritus of the National Maritime Museum, and is continuing her research interests in the history of scientific instruments, on which she is an internationally recognised authority. Both of our children went to Devonshire Avenue primary school, in our Ward, and to a local State secondary school, Nonsuch. I am very proud of my daughters. Jane was a barrister, though sadly she died in June 2017 of a brain tumour, and Eleanor gives the community great service by working as a marketing and communications officer for a charity for the homeless in Birmingham (St. Basil’s). She also founded and was the first editor of a newspaper for the homeless (The Pavement, West Midlands), something she did as an unpaid volunteer.\nHere is a picture of my elder daughter, Jane, at her wedding in 2010. Her husband Tetteh is a fellow barrister. His family come from Ghana though he was born in Northern Ireland. The group is Gloria, Tet, Jane, me, Tet’s mother Vin. The wedding took place in the Gladstone Library of the National Liberal Club.\nHere are Tet and Jane on 23 June 2015 in St Thomas’s hospital with my first grandchild, Ciaran, then aged one day. Sadly, Jane was diagnosed with a brain tumour in May 2016 and died in June 2017. I spend a lot of my time childminding Ciaran. Tet is now a senior barrister at the Crown Prosecution Service.\nHere is a picture of my younger daughter, Ellie, at her wedding, the previous year. Her husband, Jeff, works in IT. They were married at the beautiful country church of St. Bartholomew, in Tardebigge, in Worcestershire . Ellie still lives in Birmngham. She has a daughter, my second grandchild, born in April 2017, and a son, my third grandchild, born in December 2021.\nI have been active in local organisations, including at one time being chair of my local residents’ association, the Highfields Residents’ Association.\nFor much of my career I worked in public service and I was at one time the chair of the Board of the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, based in Bilbao, in Spain. This is the principal European Union agency in this field. Given this experience, it was perhaps inevitable that when elected to Sutton Council I would be invited to be chair of the Sutton Joint Health and Safety Committee. My experience as chair of the board of a European Union Agency and, during my career, taking part in European Union Council of Ministers working group meetings negotiating Directives on subjects as diverse as genetic modification and the safety of machinery, made me a strong supporter of the European Union. Having a group of people from a number of different countries sitting round a table agreeing what is in effect an international standard is of immense value to the citizens of all these countries. I was disappointed at the decision to withdraw from the European Union. I was until April 2011 head of the binational (UK – France) safety organisation for the channel tunnel, established by international Treaty, but decided to retire from this role to concentrate on my activities as a Councillor. I still find time to play the trumpet in a Sutton-based concert band and some other local bands.”\nI\n[…] Who Are We? Trish and Richard introduce themselves […]",

Trish was first elected in 2014 and was re-elected in 2018 and 2022. Louise was elected in 2022.

Sutton Central Ward is immediately north of our Ward, Sutton South.\nRichard got more votes than all the other six candidates added together. The result was\nLiberal Democrats 1291\nConservatives 327\nReform 282\nLabour 216\nThree other candidates (the Greens, an independent and the Christian People’s Alliance) each got less than 100 votes.\nThe Liberal Democrat share of the vote increased by 17.4%, the Conservatives fell by 10% and Labour – who finished second in this seat in 2022 – by 17.4%.\nOn 3 March the Council discussed the budget proposals for the coming year. Legally, the Council is required to set a balanced budget. With so many Councils going bust or in great financial difficulty, this was always going to be a difficult task. The problems are due to a legacy of Government cuts but also a big spike in demand for services. While people think of the Council as the body that mends the potholes, empties the bins and fixes the street lights, 70% of spending is on adult social care and children’s services (particularly for those children with special educational needs), plus the cost of finding accommodation for the homeless. There has been an increase in demand in the past year, particularly in the number of adults whose social care has to be paid for by the Council, the number of children with special educational needs and in the number of homeless families.\nRichard spoke in the debate, on homelessness – a subject in which he has a special interest due to the work history of his daughter, Ellie, who worked for many years for a homelessness charity and because as chair of Planning Committee he has a role in increasing the supply of affordable family accommodation.\nHere is Richard’s speech:\n“I would like to direct the attention of Council to paragraph 8.11 of the supplemental agenda which is discussing financial risks.\nIt says that the biggest driver of overspending by London boroughs is the number of people presenting as homeless and who need to be offered temporary accommodation.\nThe paper tells us Sutton had 1 084 households homeless and in temporary accommodation in October last year. It is a higher figure tonight. It is a frightening figure. Tonight we are discussing homelessness as a financial risk to the Council, but we all recognise that the fundamental reason for our concern is that behind so many of these cases are stories of tragedy, of families losing their homes and often winding up in bed and breakfast accommodation remote from their workplace and remote from the schools their children attend.\nThere is a housing crisis and we need more homes. Residents comment on the number of new flats being built in the centre of Sutton but we need this accommodation.\nThe aspiration of the Government to build more homes is right – but it has to be tempered by a concern about quality and about dealing with the consequences.\nSutton is very built up. It is not always easy to see where the new homes will come from, particularly when we are all rightly sensitive to the concerns of residents about inappropriate development and the pressures intensification can bring.\nIt is worthwhile re-stating the principles in our local plan for Sutton.\nWe need more housing, but it must be of good quality – good enough for Sutton, which means of high quality.\nWe aim to reduce development pressures on what I call the “suburban heartland” of the borough by concentrating development in the areas where development is appropriate.\nIn particular there is a zone of potential intensification close to the town centre where public transport connections are good. This may mean some tall buildings. It may mean car free or car light development as you can provide much more accommodation if you do not have to provide a parking space for every unit, and this is more acceptable in areas close to the railway station and the town centre where public transport connections are good.\nWe have a local plan, currently under review, which sets out how we meet the requirements for infrastructure to support an increase in population, which is an important concern of residents.\nI am always keen to point out that our local plan is not like the local plan you might find in, for example, North Korea, mandating what will be built. It is aspirational. It depends on developers bringing forward proposals. Its success depends a lot on the skills of our planning staff in negotiating with developers to secure what is good for Sutton, which may not be what makes most profit for the developer. I would like to pay tribute to the work of our planning staff and in particular the head, Andy Webber, who retires this month.\nIn the past year the planning system has had a bad press. The Government says we are going for growth, growth, growth. Quite right. But when asked what are the impediments to growth they invariably cite the planning system – which is represented as run by NIMBYS frustrating necessary development. That might well be the case in some places – not here in Sutton of course. But I think there is a counter argument that the planning system is a bastion against having fields and fields of sub-standard housing, as that is what makes money for developers. We destroy the planning system at our peril. But it is also right that we need a planning system that does not stand in the way of necessary change and renewal, but ensures high quality and appropriate development, to provide housing and to stimulate the economy.\nI think we have a good track record in Sutton in supporting high quality development and there are many examples in our borough of developments characterised by good design providing quality housing and infrastructure. That is what we need.”\nThe bench at the junction of The Ridgway and Mayfield Road\nThere are a number of locations in our Ward where there are benches to enable weary pedestrians to put up their feet. At the most recent meeting of the Council’s local committee we got agreement to re-new two benches in the Ward that have deteriorated over time. These are benches in Copse Hill and the one in the photograph, which is at the junction of The Ridgway and Mayfield Road.\nThere is a history to some of the benches in our Ward. In 1988 the South Sutton Neighbourhood Association celebrated the tenth anniversary of its foundation by funding a bench in Cavendish Road close to Ambleside Gardens. The bench was, after over twenty years of use and exposure to the elements, in a very sorry state. We took action to get the bench restored, with the plaque explaining the history of the bench moved to the new bench.\nOn the 27th of January Sutton Council met. Richard raised the issue of the reasons why a recent survey by The Times newspaper ranked Sutton as the eighth most attractive place to live in England. This finding does not surprise us. We spend a lot of time knocking on the doors of our residents to introduce ourselves as your local Councillors and we find people generally say they really like Sutton, mentioning a strong sense of community, open spaces, low crime, good schools, a green and pleasant environment, parks, street trees, being convenient for London and for the countryside. This is particularly the case with people who have moved to Sutton from elsewhere, particularly those from other London boroughs, from Hong Kong and from Ukraine. Please write to us and tell us what you like about Sutton or think we can improve.\nWe are always keen to look at ways of improving our Ward.\nLast year traffic engineers undertook a study of traffic flows in our Ward and the results of the exercise are listed in a later post on this site. The results have not led to some “standout” conclusion as to a problem that needs tackling but traffic officers are examining three main issues:\nwhether action can be taken to improve the safety and the experience of pedestrians crossing the Kings Lane bridge without closing the road to vehicles. The bridge is narrow. Installing a second bridge would be impossibly expensive. Marking a pedestrian path at one side of the road might be feasible. We would welcome the views of users of the bridge, both pedestrians and motorists\nsimilarly, whether something can be done to improve the safety and the experience of pedestrians passing under the railway bridge in Langley Park Road. Some proposals are to be consulted on\npossible improvements to the busy junction where Cedar Road crosses Langley Park Road. Residents have spoken to us of the difficulties pedestrians have in crossing Langley Park Road. Consultation with residents in adjacent streets is underway on proposals to install two new traffic islands in Langley Park Road. These will form a safe area in the middle of the road so the road can be crossed by pedestrians in two phases.\nYour views on these issues, and views on any other traffic and parking issues you would like us to look at would be welcomed.\nThe police met residents of Sutton South Ward again on the evening of 15 January 2025, at Devonshire Avenue school. There are open, public meetings held quarterly at which the police discuss the policing of the Ward with local residents. We were addressed by our Ward Constable, Constable Robyn Skivens, who went through the crime statistics for the Ward. Sutton has a lower crime rate than most outer London boroughs and our Ward has one of the lowest crime rates in Sutton. However, crime always has a significant impact on the victim and public concern remains high. The draft minutes of the meeting are as below.\nSUTTON SOUTH COMMUNITY / POLICE MEETING. 15 JANUARY 2025 Attended by PC Robyn Skivens and PCSO Helen Maguire for the police. A report was given on main crime trends from 1 September to the date of the meeting. DRUG OFFENCES There had been 18 drug offences, mainly possession of drugs, mainly cannabis. While this was higher than normal the increase was partly attributable to a special police operation at Sutton train station. Four of these crimes were the interception by the Border Force of drug shipments. Where such a shipment is to premises in our Ward it will count in our statistics. BURGLARY There had been 21 burglaries or attempted burglaries. This included residential burglaries, burglaries of garages and sheds, and some burglaries of businesses. It was noted that there was usually a seasonal increase in burglary at this time of year as it was darker earlier. There had been eight residential burglaries. However, some that had been reported in sheltered accommodation in the Ward were later disproved and attributed to dementia. A disturbing case was that of a landlord who was able to let himself into a flat and commit theft. Two burglaries of garages had involved theft of bicycles. Mention was made of a shop in Brighton Road where the window was smashed and the wooden panel that was then put in place to secure the premises was pulled away to facilitate burglary. Mention was made of the theft of tools from a construction site in the Ward. Some burglaries had involved the theft of keys, which were then used to commit further offences (theft of a car key leading to theft of a car). The police stressed the need to make sure keys were kept out of sight – if the keys can be seen from your letterbox you are inviting crime.\nVEHICLE CRIME\nThere had been 14 instances of vehicle crime (theft of vehicles, damage to vehicles, theft from vehicles). The police stressed the need to avoid leaving anything of value on display in your car, or in the car at all. An unusual crime had been the theft of an excavator and a dumper from the road works in Brighton Road. THEFT There had been 23 crimes in a category the police described as “theft and kindred (to theft)” events. This included shoplifting, parcel theft, theft of pedal cycles and mobile phones. Examples mentioned included theft of scrap metal, theft of a wheelie bin and theft of a wedding ring by distraction techniques. MAJOR CRIMES There had been nine major, violent crimes in the Ward. This included several robberies at the train station, a large group altercation outside a restaurant, a fight between two drug users, and a concerning incident of a woman who was followed from the station and robbed. There were also two incidents of arson, of a bin and of a Ford transit. A ULEZ camera was deliberately damaged. There was an incident where a drug user was searched and a knife, and bladed articles, were found to be in his possession. There was a disturbing incident of an anti-semitic symbol being daubed on a wall outside the synagogue in Cedar Road. There had been a succession of incidents related to a woman living in Cedar Road who had engaged in anti- social activities that had attracted a community of drug users to her premises. This was now the subject of police reports to the DPS that were expected to lead to her being charged with serious offences. SPEEDING The police had been conducting a programme of visits to local care homes and sheltered housing to talk about scams. Residents had raised with them concerns about speeding in Cavendish Road, which had led to police action in that road. There was a discussion of speeding in local roads including Chalgrove Road, Langley Park Road, The Ridgway and Cavendish Road. The police had been carrying out speed checks in Chalgrove Road and Cavendish Road. The action in Cavendish Road had led to twelve drivers receiving warnings. The police would consider further action against speeding in local roads, subject to resources.\nOTHER MATTERS DISCUSSED Staffing levels: There should be in theory be a third officer on the Ward to support Robyn and Helen, but they were coping. The number of “extractions” when they were called away to join police exercises elsewhere in London, or at the Croydon custody suite, remained an issue of concern but was now running close to 35% of their time rather than the 50% it had once been. Mention was made of local concern about a story that a body had been discovered at a house in Egmont Road. The police assured the meeting that there was no wider implication of this incident. The next meeting was tentatively scheduled for Wednesday 14 May at Devonshire Avenue school (7pm) subject to the police checking their work rota. The meeting thanked Robyn for coming back from leave to attend the meeting and thanked the officers for their work for the community in dealing with crime in the Ward. The meeting thanked Fiona Ostler for letting us meet at the school. The date of the next meeting was provisionally set as Wednesday 14 May, at Devonshire Avenue primary school and thought continues to be given to what could be done to better publicise the meeting and get a better attendance.\nConstable Skivens, Louise, Trish and Richard with other Ward police officers at the Sutton South Hello Christmas party\nThe Phoenix Concert Band – which is based in our Ward and for which Richard plays trumpet – were busy over the Christmas period raising money for the Mayor of Sutton’s charity appeal. The band practices every Friday in the church at Christchurch in Christchurch Park. A concert in the church, staged by the band in December, drew an audience of over a hundred and raised £790 for the charity appeal. The band also played Christmas carols at an event in the Straw cafe in Manor Park in December, which raised £360. On the last Saturday before Christmas the band joined a wider group of musicians to play Christmas carols in the atrium of the St Nicholas shopping centre in Sutton (see photo) which raised £180, so £1330 in all. We were grateful to the Mayor, Councillor Colin Stears, who attended all these events. In addition the band played a concert at the Friends’ Meeting House in Cedar Road on the second Saturday in December, to entertain an enthusiastic audience before the “Second Saturday Tea” which the Quakers provide every month on the second Saturday. The Mayor of Sutton’s charities are Home-Start, Sutton, and Sutton, Kingston and Epsom – Parkinson’s UK. Our contribution to the appeal was dwarfed by the £10 000 prize for second place in the boroughs’ competition won by the Sutton float in the London New Year’s Day parade.\nWe pride ourselves on the fact that we have a network of dedicated volunteers who deliver our “FOCUS” magazine throughout the Ward. If you have the odd half hour a few times a year to support us in this way please contact us. We recently prepared an end of year newsletter to update our volunteer deliverers on our activities. We thought we would share it with those who look at our website.\n“The last year has been our most successful year in Sutton South Ward. With the election of Luke as our Member of Parliament in July we have, for the first time, three Liberal Democrat Councillors representing our Ward and a Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament representing us at Westminster. We held a successful Ward meeting on 28 November where we heard from Luke on the incredibly busy life he now has as our Member of Parliament. He has been meeting all the important community groups in Sutton and Cheam, and has made speeches in Parliament on a variety of issues – ranging from the importance of support for carers to the future of Taiwan. In his maiden speech he spoke about what a pleasant place Sutton is to live, work and raise a family, a great change from the previous MP who spent all his time running Sutton down. He is enthusiastic about his role as spokesperson for London. As Ward Councillors, we have a lot of local casework that we deal with and are doing more than our fair bit as Chairs of Council committees – Trish chairing the Audit and Governance Committee, Richard the Planning Committee and Louise combining being chair of the Licensing Committee with her role as Deputy Mayor. This is her second year as Deputy Mayor following the three years during which Trish was Mayor.\nLike every local authority, Sutton Council is pre-occupied by financial issues and struggling with some difficult decisions to balance the books. The decision to close the Registrar’s office (The Russetings) in Worcester Road was one we regretted, driven by a need to consolidate services in fewer buildings, but we believe planning controls are sufficient to protect the appearance of this attractive, locally listed, building in the street scene.\nWe have secured funding for improvements to the WArd, including new information signs at the only open space in our Ward – the Devonshire Avenue Nature Area (DANA). Maintenance of the nature area involves a balance of ensuring it is a peaceful place for people to visit while preserving the biodiversity of the site. There is now a Friends of DANA group – let us know if you would like to join it. We are already looking forward to our next electoral challenge, to retain control of the Council in 2026.

We welcome talking or corresponding with you and with all our residents. We hope to have further Ward meetings next year. We are really grateful for the help we get.”\nSutton South Councillors were concerned to learn about changes proposed to the organisation of the Police Cadets, who meet at a school in our ward. Currently there are over 120 cadets. However, the decision has been made to close junior cadets and cut the remaining senior cadets to just 46. Their future programme is also being severely curtailed. This will have a major impact on the youth of this borough who will no longer have the opportunity to participate in activities such as camps, parades and Duke of Edinburgh awards.\nCouncillor Louise Phelan, whose son has been a Cadet, commented “I’ve seen first-hand the benefits of being part of police cadets. They learn valuable life skills, and gain self confidence. They also support the local community and get to take part in things they wouldn’t otherwise have had the opportunity to do. For many this is a stepping stone into a career within the police force, for others the Cadets help to keep them on the right path and make better life decisions. I am incredibly concerned others will now not get these opportunities.”",

The appeal seeks to overturn the decision of Sutton Council to reject the latest planning application for the property, and seeks an award of costs against the Council. We oppose the appeal.\nOur comments are as below. The history of this development is described in our comments. Designs for a block of four small flats were twice rejected by the Council, Richard speaking to the Development Control Committee on the successive applications, but the developer has still built something without planning permission and asked the remote Planning Inspectorate, based in Bristol, to overturn democratic local decisions. We invite residents to use any of this material in framing their own objections.\nSubmissions should be marked “For the attention of Peter Lyne, The Planning Inspectorate.” Quote the reference\nAPPEAL. APP/P5870/A/13/7205143. 39A EATON ROAD, SUTTON, SURREY. SM2 5EA\nThe email address is teamp2@pins.gsi.gov.uk\nPostal address: Peter Lyne, The Planning Inspectorate\n3/10 Wing, TempleQuay House\n2 The Square, Bristol, BS1 6PN\n“Submission by Councillors Richard Clifton and Heather Honour, Liberal Democrat Councillors for Sutton South Ward, London Borough of Sutton.\nAPPEAL. APP/P5870/A/13/7205143.\n39A EATON ROAD, SUTTON, SURREY. SM2 5EA\nWe are Councillors for Sutton South Ward in the London Borough of Sutton, where this property is situated. We ask you to consider the following concerning this appeal.\nThe process followed by the developer has aroused much local disquiet. It is a tale of three designs. The first design was rejected by Sutton Council but passed by the Planning Inspectorate on appeal. There was then a change of ownership of the property and a second design was proposed. This was also turned down by Sutton Council. The developer could at that point have appealed to the Planning Inspectorate but chose not to do so. Instead he demolished the house and built something different from what he had permission for, the third design.\nRegardless of what the Inspectorate now decides on the substance of the case, there would be no justice in any award of costs to the developer, as he has ignored planning law in building something for which he does not have permission, perhaps hoping no-one would notice. Nor would it be right not to ask the developer to mitigate some of the negative effects of the structure built without permission.\nThe structure as built departs from the design for which permission was obtained in a number of ways that we find objectionable. In particular, the overall height is greater and the design of the windows at the front is different. The comment was made by a Councillor at the Development Control Committee discussion that the approved design made it look like a house but the design built made it look more like a block of flats. It is a far less attractive design.\nThere is an oddness about the boundary wall with 6 ConistonGardens. The block of flats has been built right up to the boundary and is so close to the wall of number 6 that it abuts it. This seems to ensure that there will eventually be damp problems for the flats adjacent to this wall and no way of dealing with the problem. In addition the guttering overhangs the adjacent property at this side and it seems inevitable that there will be significant damp problems.\nThe window at the side, facing number 6, is of a changed design that increases overlooking. It is not frosted in any way.\nWe would draw your attention, in particular, to the comments made by the neighbour at number 6, Mrs Kite, and the comments of the Council, both of which we support.\nRICHARD CLIFTON\nHEATHER HONOUR\nCouncillors for Sutton South Ward, London Borough of Sutton.”",

The national average was 58.3 per cent, while 62.2 per cent of outer London pupils achieved the benchmark this summer.\nAn impressive 91.2 per cent of Sutton’s 16-year-olds earned five or more A*-C grades in any subject, compared to an outer London average of 82.7 per cent.\nThis is excellent news and confirms something we have known for a long time; that Sutton has some of the very best schools in the country. To top the table, ahead of every other local authority area in England, is a real achievement, and one that teachers, parents and students will be delighted about. All those pupils who took GCSE exams this summer should be very proud of themselves.\nThe local authority looks forward to working in partnership with those schools which have since become academies, to ensure these results continue.\nIn August it was revealed that Sutton pupils had achieved their best ever SATs results, placing the borough third in the national league table. The tests in reading, writing and mathematics, are taken by 11-year-olds at the end of their primary education.\nIt also follows Sutton being announced as the best place in London to bring up a family.

A small area of Warren Park is protected by a wooden picket fence, to prevent the area being trampled. This is an area of chalk grassland, an important area for biodiversity which encourages some unusual plants and butterflies. Earlier in the year the fence was extensively vandalised and the area damaged by trampling (and dog poo). There was discussion, which we were involved in, about whether the fence should be repaired, replaced by sturdier fencing that would be more effective but unsightly, or removed, with the biodiversity area abandoned.\nEventually it was repaired but within a few days it had been extensively vandalised again. It has now been repaired yet again and notices put on the fencing to try to explain the importance of the area and to appeal to the vandals to leave it alone.\nWe are not sure what the impact is likely to be but hope for the best.",

Cycling across to the bridge, I found the heavy and quick leaf fall this autumn had led to a mulch of leaves blocking the drains. While there are over 20 000 street trees in Sutton, so the annual leaf fall stretches the cleaning teams, Grange Vale is also affected by fall from trees owned by Network Rail, on the railway line. I dealt with the problem by myself clearing away the leaf debris. I have asked the response team to give priority to Grange Vale during the leaf fall next year.\nAlso, just after Christmas, residents in Cavendish Road reported the dumping of rubbish all round the bin adjacent to Fiske Court. I cycled over to look at the problem. I cleared the rubbish back into the bin but more was dumped the following day. I have got tyhe response team to slightly move the bin and, for the time being, check it daily.\nA resident of Leslie Gardens, a cul-de-sac off Worcester Road, approached me concerning the problems experienced during the snow last winter, as there is no grit bin near the road and a slight incline at the entrance turns it into an ice rink. After discussion with Council officials, I obtained a new grit bin which has been placed in the road. This adds to the large number of grit bins placed at locations throughout the Ward by the Council over the last two years. Other bins, such as the ones in Hillcroome Road and in Downside Road, were placed at our specific request after discussion with residents.\nThese are not isolated successes. We have achieved many. For example, see below the litter bin obtained, following an approach from a resident, which we got placed at a strategic point in Cedar Road (said by a resident to be at about the point someone walking back from the station with a takeway snack would finish it and drop litter). Also the tree we got planted in Copse Hill (which replaced a tree demolished by a car in a road traffic accident).\nLet us know of other strategic locations in the Ward where something is needed.",

She said: “Whilst we have always been aware that a bidder could withdraw during the process, at this stage in the transaction it is obviously very disappointing news.\n“The Transaction Board has a meeting scheduled next week (7 February 2012) and we will use this to consider the options and agree a way forward. This may include re-opening tenders for St Helier and Sutton hospitals.”\nMatthew Hopkins, Trust Chief Executive said: “This is disappointing news, but St George’s have been clear to us that their decision is not based on our staff, nor the quality of the services we provide at St Helier and Sutton hospitals.\n“As you would expect, the Trust Board and those working on the transaction have been looking at other options in case this happened and we look forward to discussing these with the Transaction Board next week.\n“Whilst we are making decisions about the long-term future of our hospitals, our priority will – as ever – continue to be ensuring our patients and local people receive the very best services.”\nAsked what this means for Epsom Hospital, Jan added: “It is the current belief that, subject to Ashford and St Peter’s Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust being confirmed as the Preferred Partner for Epsom Hospital, the de-merger could continue whilst we make alternative arrangements for St Helier and Sutton.\n“Whilst this would, of course, need further investigation and approval by the Transaction Board, the Trust Board and others, it is felt that this would be in the best interest of Epsom Hospital, its patients, staff and local people.\n“However, I would emphasise that the priority remains to secure the future of Epsom, St Helier and Sutton hospitals.”\nFor more information about the work of the Trust visit our website: www.epsom-sthelier.nhs.uk. You can also follow us on Twitter (twitter.com/epsom_sthelier) or find us on Facebook (facebook.com/epsomsthelier).\nThis is what St Georges said in their press release:\nSt George’s media statement\nSt George’s Healthcare NHS Trust submitted a bid for a potential merger with St Helier Hospital in November 2011.\nThe board is clear that a merger between St George’s Healthcare and St Helier would be an excellent strategic opportunity, with the potential to bring significant improvements to the care of patients across southwest London and beyond.\nAfter careful consideration the board has reached the conclusion that the current terms of the merger prevent us from proceeding further at this time.\nThe level of financial challenge facing hospitals in south west London, combined with the inability to pre-empt the outcome of a public consultation around the Better Services Better Value (BSBV) review, means this is not the right time for us to progress with the transaction.\nWe want to continue to build on the existing links that are in place for clinical services. We have identified a number of the potential benefits to patients that would occur from an acquisition which could also be delivered if the organisations remained separate legal entities which we shall continue to pursue.\nWe are particularly keen to develop the clinical and academic networks that span St George’s Healthcare and St Helier, and explore opportunities to establish new networks across services, to the benefit of patients.\nA key priority for the trust is to achieve Foundation Trust (FT) status by 2014, and we will focus our efforts on achieving this. The board feels strongly that achieving FT status will strengthen the opportunities for St. George’s Healthcare and St Helier to work together in the future.\nThis is what Ashford and St Peters have had to say:\nStatement re Epsom Hospital\nChief Executive at Ashford and St Peter’s Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Andrew Liles, said:\n“The decision made by St George’s Healthcare NHS Trust not to pursue their bid for St Helier and Sutton hospitals has not changed our position regarding Epsom and we will continue to progress our plans to acquire Epsom hospital (through merger) in line with the process set out by the Transaction Board. Of course this is still subject to approval by the Transaction Board, Epsom and St Helier, the local health authorities and others and by our own Board, who will need to be assured that any final decision is in the best interests of both the Epsom and Ashford and St Peter’s catchment populations.\nAs a Foundation Trust already we feel we are in a strong position strategically to pursue these plans and we know they have already passed through the first stage of the process successfully, meeting the criteria set by local people, stakeholders and staff. These include new and innovative partnerships – with The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, Central Surrey Health and Surrey and Sussex Partnership NHS Trust – to create an integrated healthcare campus at Epsom Hospital, bringing additional services and added benefits to local patients and staff. Our plans are also made more straightforward by the fact that Epsom hospital is not part of the Better Services Better Value review in South West London.\nWe have also had positive initial discussions regarding financial and commissioning support for our plans, although of course final decisions regarding the preferred provider and agreement of financial support are still to be made.”\nFor more information please call the Press Office on: 01932 722163",

These are people from all over the world who share a desire to be British citizens, and have taken examinations in the English language and in our history and way of life to obtain citizenship. On 16 December there were people from Iraq, Sri Lanka, India, Hong Kong and Rwanda. On 10 November there were people from Ethiopia, India, Nigeria,Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bulgaria, Tunisia, South Africa and Zimbabwe, all of whom had successfully applied for British citizenship. On 8 December there were people from Nepal, Sri Lanka, India, the Ukraine, South Korea, the USA and the Congo.\nRichard says “I find these ceremonies moving. Britain benefits enormously from being a multi-racial society, with so many different cultures learning from each other. These people will be a great credit to Britain, and are enthusiastic about becoming British citizens. They will bring to our country cultures and experiences that we will learn from and which will make Britain a better place.”\nThis is the text of his speech of welcome, elaborating on the standard speech normally made at this ceremony in order to draw particular attention to the many advantages of setting up home in the London Borough of Sutton, and the benefits to Sutton of the skills and experiences that people from such diverse backgrounds bring to our community.\n“It is indeed a great pleasure for me to extend my personal welcome you all, as well as welcoming you on behalf of the London Borough of Sutton and on behalf of the government of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the second.\nI am delighted that you have either chosen Sutton as a place to live or have chosen Sutton to celebrate this very special occasion.\nSutton cherishes its diversity and today we are celebrating this with all of you, people who come from many different parts of the world. You bring with you cultures and experiences which we will value, and which can help to continue to make Sutton a great place to live and to work. You have many opportunities to participate in the local community, in particular by volunteering to help in a wide range of groups and activities where your expertise and experience would be invaluable to the community.\nMany of you have children. Sutton is proud to have excellent schools and opportunities for our young people. We look to inspire young people so they develop and thrive in a learning environment. This year students at Sutton schools achieved the best GCSE results in the country.\nA recent study rated Sutton as the best place in London to bring up children. The study looked at factors such as low crime rates, affordability of houses, earnings and access to good schools, and concluded that Sutton is the best Borough in London to set up home. So, for those of you who have set up home in Sutton, congratulations on making such a wise choice.\nSutton is also the Borough with the highest percentage of residents in work – 78% of Sutton’s working age population has a job, and there is evidence that in this period of recession Sutton remains vibrant.\nThe green spaces and parks in Sutton enable everyone to enjoy their leisure time. Sutton is proud of its “green” environment – having over 1 500 acres of parks and open spaces and over 20 000 street trees. There is also a wide range of other facilities in the Borough such as libraries, theatres, and the Life centre, which encourages citizenship and learning.\nHistorically Sutton has been linked to the Queens and Kings of England. King Henry 8th was frequently a visitor to the Borough having a home in Nonsuch park.\nThis house that we are in today is a fine example of Victorian architecture, once inhabited by the Walls family, a name you may recognise, famous for their Walls Ice Cream and Walls Sausages. But there are many other heritage sites worthy of a visit including Whitehall in Cheam and The Honeywood centre in Carshalton. Since 1965 this building has been the Register office, registering important life events such as births, deaths marriages, civil partnerships and – today – people choosing to take British citizenship.\nAs we look across the world and realise how fortunate we are to live in a democracy, I urge you all as new citizens to use the opportunity to vote in our elections, to shape the future of the Borough and your new country. Your next opportunity to do that will be in May, when we elect a new Mayor of London and a London Assembly.\nMay I congratulate you all and wish you happiness and success as new British Citizens. “\nThis is Richard with the Registrar, who conducted the ceremony.",

You can also follow us on Twitter (twitter.com/epsom_sthelier) or find us on Facebook (facebook.com/epsomsthelier).\nThis is what St Georges said in their press release:\nSt George’s media statement\nSt George’s Healthcare NHS Trust submitted a bid for a potential merger with St Helier Hospital in November 2011.\nThe board is clear that a merger between St George’s Healthcare and St Helier would be an excellent strategic opportunity, with the potential to bring significant improvements to the care of patients across southwest London and beyond.\nAfter careful consideration the board has reached the conclusion that the current terms of the merger prevent us from proceeding further at this time.\nThe level of financial challenge facing hospitals in south west London, combined with the inability to pre-empt the outcome of a public consultation around the Better Services Better Value (BSBV) review, means this is not the right time for us to progress with the transaction.\nWe want to continue to build on the existing links that are in place for clinical services. We have identified a number of the potential benefits to patients that would occur from an acquisition which could also be delivered if the organisations remained separate legal entities which we shall continue to pursue.\nWe are particularly keen to develop the clinical and academic networks that span St George’s Healthcare and St Helier, and explore opportunities to establish new networks across services, to the benefit of patients.\nA key priority for the trust is to achieve Foundation Trust (FT) status by 2014, and we will focus our efforts on achieving this. The board feels strongly that achieving FT status will strengthen the opportunities for St. George’s Healthcare and St Helier to work together in the future.\nThis is what Ashford and St Peters have had to say:\nStatement re Epsom Hospital\nChief Executive at Ashford and St Peter’s Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Andrew Liles, said:\n“The decision made by St George’s Healthcare NHS Trust not to pursue their bid for St Helier and Sutton hospitals has not changed our position regarding Epsom and we will continue to progress our plans to acquire Epsom hospital (through merger) in line with the process set out by the Transaction Board. Of course this is still subject to approval by the Transaction Board, Epsom and St Helier, the local health authorities and others and by our own Board, who will need to be assured that any final decision is in the best interests of both the Epsom and Ashford and St Peter’s catchment populations.\nAs a Foundation Trust already we feel we are in a strong position strategically to pursue these plans and we know they have already passed through the first stage of the process successfully, meeting the criteria set by local people, stakeholders and staff. These include new and innovative partnerships – with The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, Central Surrey Health and Surrey and Sussex Partnership NHS Trust – to create an integrated healthcare campus at Epsom Hospital, bringing additional services and added benefits to local patients and staff. Our plans are also made more straightforward by the fact that Epsom hospital is not part of the Better Services Better Value review in South West London.\nWe have also had positive initial discussions regarding financial and commissioning support for our plans, although of course final decisions regarding the preferred provider and agreement of financial support are still to be made.”\nFor more information please call the Press Office on: 01932 722163",

This results from changes proposed by the Government to “localise” Council tax benefit payments.\nThe Government’s proposals provide opportunities but present major problems. They enable Sutton to adopt its own scheme of entitlement to Council tax benefit (paid to those in hardship to help them make Council tax payments) but since the funding provided by the Government has been cut to 90% of the previous level the scheme Sutton will be required to adopt is bound to be less generous than the current scheme.\nYou can see the full proposals by clicking on this link.\nThe one positive aspect is that it will enable Sutton, subject to consultation, to remove incentives for people to keep properties empty, by removing discounts that enable people with empty homes and second homes to pay less council tax.\nWhile the new scheme for paying Council tax benefit is less generous, the Council has sought to protect the elderly, the disabled and those with small children. This is in accordance with our principled belief, as Liberal Democrats, in fairness and helping the disadvantaged.\nRichard, as vice-chair of the Housing, Economy and Business Committee, is closely involved in this work. He says “no-one wants to introduce a less generous scheme for payment of Council tax benefit, but Government decisions force us to do this. The one ray of light in these proposals is that we can put pressure on people who are keeping properties they own empty to get them back into the housing market. When properties are in short supply we cannot afford to have homes remaining empty.”",

He said:\n“We all know the importance to Sutton of maintaining a through rail service to north London.\nI want to stress the importance of links to St Pancras International as St Pancras develops further as an international rail hub.\nOver the next few years there will be a positive mushrooming of international rail travel from London. If the current plans of Deutschbahn and Eurostar come to fruition, by 2014 it will be possible, on arriving at St Pancras, to have a choice of services to travel from London to Amsterdam.\nIn addition to the current services to Brussels and Paris there will also be services from London to North Germany. This is a big market in terms of business travel. At present, each day, about 30 planes fly from London’s airports to destinations in north Germany, carrying about the same number of people as could be carried by just a few trains, using the Velaro D trains that are being built to provide rolling stock for these new services from London, by the train manufacturer Siemens at its Dusseldorf factory, which in fact I visited recently.\nAside from the potential importance of these international links to the residents of Sutton, there are international companies that have significant centres of their enterprises in Sutton – Sutton, a thriving London suburb, offering office space much cheaper than that found in the centre of London, less than half an hour by train from the centre, with a pleasant ambience and environment, and a location from which – importantly – you can reach the centre of Brussels in just two train journeys, one taking about 40 minutes and one about 2 hours. And the centre of Paris in just 15 minutes more. And soon – Amsterdam, north Germany.\nNow, these are transport links that it is vital for Sutton to maintain, for the sake of our residents but also to maintain our attractiveness as a centre for business development. When I look at the data on economic activity that comes regularly to the new Housing, Economy and Business committee, some clear conclusions stand out. It is clear that Sutton is doing relatively well in terms of surviving the recession and maintaining one of the highest rates of economic activity on the part of its residents of any part of London. But we need to continue to attract new businesses.\nThe Tramlink extension is perhaps equally important, particularly in relation to the north Sutton site, which is an attractive site, and on which the Housing, Economy and Business committee now has a task group working on the planning brief. Our current plans include scope for a Tramlink stop at the site, something that will greatly enhance its appeal, and we see this development as an important part of our future growth strategy.\nSo we must keep pressure on TfL to continue work on the feasibility of the Sutton Tramlink proposal, and make clear to the Department for Transport that changes that remove our linoks to north London and in particular to St Pancras, are not acceptable.\nThe Thameslink service is absolutely vital. Losing it would sever our only direct link to North London and would mean Sutton residents would need to take at least two trains to get to St Pancras. It is quite scandalous that, at a time when we should be improving public transport, there is a serious proposal to cut the link between North and South London.”\nWe need to act now as the Department for Transport is currently consulting on the new seven-year Thameslink franchise which will run from September next year and incorporate the Southern franchise from 2015.\nIronically, the cross-London Loop Line service which runs through Sutton, Carshalton and Hackbridge stations, was recently reopened at nights and weekends after being split for three and a half years by engineering work. It is all very well reopening it now, but Sutton’s residents need the line to stay open for good.\nThe new franchise will set service patterns for 2018 and beyond, so it is vital that we act now and do not become a Cinderella area for rail transport.\nTo view the DfT consultation document visit www.dft.gov.uk/consultations\nTo give your input into Sutton’s response, email alex.forrest@sutton.gov.uk\nRichard and Heather will be submitting their own response.\nMore detail about the attitude the Council is taking, opposing this threat, is in a further post on this site “Train Links To North London Must Remain” (see archive July 2011).\nHeather and Richard outside Sutton station",

The summer meeting was cancelled at a late point due to it being on the evening of one of the football matches England were involved in in the World Cup. This was a meeting that left us feeling worried. An increase in crime, in burglaries and thefts from motor vehicles, was reported for the first time for some time. This may not be unrelated to problems of police numbers following the merger with Croydon and Bromley. There are a significant number of unfilled posts, vacancies, that the police are struggling to fill, particularly PCSOs (Police Community Support Officers). These officers are important for work on community relations. One member of staff is about to be moved to work in Croydon, though she did not request this move, and we are again losing our Dedicated Ward Officer, Kellie Heath.

  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_category_transport/content_154.html": "On the 27th of January Sutton Council met. Richard raised the issue of the reasons why a recent survey by The Times newspaper ranked Sutton as the eighth most attractive place to live in England. This finding does not surprise us. We spend a lot of time knocking on the doors of our residents to introduce ourselves as your local Councillors and we find people generally say they really like Sutton, mentioning a strong sense of community, open spaces, low crime, good schools, a green and pleasant environment, parks, street trees, being convenient for London and for the countryside. This is particularly the case with people who have moved to Sutton from elsewhere, particularly those from other London boroughs, from Hong Kong and from Ukraine. Please write to us and tell us what you like about Sutton or think we can improve.\nA VISIT TO CITY HALL TO PRESENT SUTTON’S PETITION OPPOSING THE EXTENSION OF ULEZ\nLouise, Richard and Trish travelled to City Hall, the HQ of London Mayor Sadiq Khan, on 30 June to join other Sutton Liberal Democrat Councillors in presenting a petition to the Mayor. The petition, signed by over 10 000 Sutton residents, expressed our opposition to the extension of the ULEZ zone to outer London boroughs. Our views on why we opposed the extension of ULEZ can be found in posts further down this site.\nDespite our opposition, ULEZ has now been extended by the London Mayor to outer London.\nNEW ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING POINTS PLANNED FOR MULGRAVE ROAD\nIn support of our policies to combat global warming and reduce carbon emissions, the programme to fit electric vehicle charging points in lampposts in our Ward continues. A further consultation exercise is about to take place on the installation of two new electric vehicle charging points in Mulgrave Road, close to the junction with Worcester Road. A preliminary consultation found majority support but few residents responded.\nThere are now charging points at the following locations:\nOpposite 49 The Ridgway\nOpposite 26 Langley Park Road\nOpposite Foxley Court in Christchurch Park\nOpposite 10 Cumnor Road\nIn Cedar Gardens\nOpposite Grange Court, Grange Road\nOpposite Thomas House, Grange Road\nOpposite 13 Stanley Road\nOpposite Fairford Court, Stanley Road\nWe want to draw attention to the Sutton Citizen space survey where residents should log their suggestions for EV charge points.\nhttps://sutton.citizenspace.com/highways-environment-and-planning/ev-survey/\nThe photo shows the first vehicle that used the first charging point in the Ward, in The Ridgway. Given the policy to ultimately phase out petrol driven vehicles, a big and continuing expansion will be needed.\nSutton Council is working with Siemens to install Ubitricity lamp column electric vehicle charging points. Ubitricity lamp column charging points are compact and fit into the door of a lamp column.\nThe aim of lamp column charging is to give residents the ability to easily charge electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles on the street where they live, especially if they do not have off-street parking or are unable to install their own home charging point. Installing residential charging points is important because a key barrier to people switching to electric vehicles is the concern around where they will be able to charge their vehicle.\nNot all lamp columns are suitable for lamp column charging points. The lamp columns need to be “electrically suitable”, be positioned near the kerb and have enough internal space to fit the charging point. They need to be sensibly located so that a vehicle could safely park and charge next to the lamp column. The lamp columns also need to be made of metal, not concrete.\nAn “earth mat”, a small metal grid, is also installed in the footway next to the lamp column. This is to make the charging point “electrically safe” if there is a fault. There are signs to indicate that the lamp column has a charging point fitted, though this sign will not prevent non-electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles from parking next to the lamp column.\nThis is a major advance in our drive to promote electric vehicles and combat global warming.\nDEVELOPMENT IN MULGRAVE ROAD\nThe owner of 34 Mulgrave Road is seeking planning permission to extend the building – in effect adding an extra storey to the top of the block of flats.\nAs local Councillors, we object to these proposals. While there is a need for more accommodation, the changes to the building will make it look incongruous and ugly, not good enough for Sutton. The changes will also involve building work that will disturb the current residents of the block The owners have used a mechanism called “prior approval” when submitting their application which, in our view, was introduced by the Government to undermine the planning system. As a result, we cannot take the application to the Council’s Planning Committee, which Richard chairs, for decision by Councillors. We may not be able to stop these changes taking place given the powers of the Planning Inspectorate to over-ride local decisions. However we are seeking to ensure that a number of conditions are stipulated in any planning permission, if one is ever granted, to try to protect the peace and quiet of the building during construction work. These include that access to the roof should be via an external hoist with all materials for work on the roof transported to the roof by an external hoist and not brought up via the well of the building. The interior of the building should not be a storage area or building site. There should be a construction management plan to minimize disruption to existing residents and ensure there are controls on dust and noise, and on hours of work. The contractors should join the Considerate Contractors’ Scheme. There should be a liaison officer that residents can contact if they observe poor behaviour. If scaffolding is erected outside residents’ windows it should only be erected when needed and removed as soon as it is not needed. We would welcome feedback from residents on your views on the proposals. You can look at the details of the application (number DM2012/00430 for 34 Mulgrave Road),\nDECISIONS ON CHANGES TO LOCAL BUS ROUTES\nTransport for London (TfL) have been consulting on changes to local bus routes, including the S1, S3, S4, 80 and 407, and have now reached decisions.\nTheir original proposals and the report on the outcome of consultation can be found on the Transport for London’s website: tfl.gov.uk/sutton-croydon-bus-changes\nThe outcome means that there is little change to the situation in our Ward.\nThe main outcome is that changes to the S3 bus that might have affected our area have not been pursued, which means the S3 will still serve Cedar Road and Langley Park Road. Changes to the S4 route that affected our area are not implemented and it will still run to Overton Grange school and along Grange Road. We are pleased with this outcome, which means there will not be any detriment to services in our Ward, and points we put into the letter of representation sent by Sutton Council have been acted on.\nEXCITING NEW STREET ART AT SUTTON STATION\nThe renowned artist Lionel Stanhope has brightened up our Ward. The painting, on the railway bridge at Sutton station, is not easy to photograph, so what is shown below is a CGI of the artwork created before the painting was undertaken. What is above, is the painting.\n| The railway bridge at Sutton station has been brightened up with a painting by the renowned artist Lionel Stanhope, whose art has brightened up many railway stations. Stanhope completed the painting in four days starting on 26 May. Stanhope is regarded by many as a better and more important street artist than Banksy. We have been pleased to support this project which brings an attractive feature to add interest to the area.The façade of the railway bridge, as you come out of Sutton station and turn left,was a patchwork of various colours. The Council first tried to interest Network Rail in making the bridge look more attractive, over four years ago, during the “Sutton Gateway” project, which involved re-paving the area around the station and the installation of the clock opposite Sutton station. The artwork has been mainly funded by Network Rail, with a small contribution from Sutton Council. The parapet of the bridge required extensive cleaning and preparation before the painting commenced. Lionel Stanhope produced a design which incorporates the word “Sutton” in the typeface traditionally used by Southern railway, and a depiction of the historic Sutton locomotive. The locomotive “Sutton” came into the possession of the Council many years ago and is a 144 year old, 28 tonne, 26 feet, A1 class Terrier steam engine. It is currently with a heritage railway undertaking in Tunbridge Wells who have undertaken to restore it. The painting is an addition to an area becoming famous for its street art. Within two hundred yards you can find the remarkable statue “The Messenger”, located directly outside the entrance to Quadrant House in The Quadrant. The Messenger is a statue, a sculpture in bronze with very dark patination, completed by David Wynne in 1981, of a large horse and rider. It was a major commission for the sculptor, who died in 2014. It took four years to complete from his first idea and inspiration, on receipt of the brief – through roughing out, refining and casting in a foundry, to the final unveiling and installation. We are not including a photograph of the statue in this post due to the philistine attitude of the owners of Quadrant House, who do not cherish this artwork and have stuck a notice on the front of it about some aspect of building maintenance, thus disfiguring it. They have been unco-operative in the face of requests to remove the notice. Even more striking is the remarkable mural by the famous Spanish “street” artist from Bilbao, Eva Mena, on a wall in nearby Wellesley Road. This is said to be of the American singer and musician Erykah Badu. The work was commissioned by the owners of the building, Indepth Hygiene Services. It was painted in three days in 2010, when the artist came over from Spain to paint it. It is entirely typical of her street art, which is to be found on walls in many parts of the world, including Egypt, Ireland and Spain, as well as Sutton. Eva Mena is said to be more famous than Banky in her native Spain. |\nSUCCESSFUL OUTCOME TO PARKING CONSULTATION\nWe now have the results of the final stage of the Council’s consultation on parking. The third round of consultation was on a proposal developed from the results of the first two consultations, for a Permit Parking Area in roads in our Ward east of Langley Park Road.\nWHAT HAPPENED IN THE EARLIER ROUNDS OF CONSULTATION\nAs parking is often raised as a problem in the regular surveys of residents on what they like about living in Sutton, the Council asked residents if parking was a problem in their road and what they would like done. Earlier rounds of consultation led to proposals that were not given sufficient support by residents for the Council to proceed with them.\nThere were concerns that unless the controls cover the whole local area parking will be displaced into roads without controls, and “free to park at any time” bays would be a magnet for commuters and long stay parkers, squeezing out residents. The alternative to schemes that have these disadvantages is a residents-only Permit Parking Area (PPA).\nTHE FINAL STAGE OF CONSULTATION\nConsequently, the Council consulted residents at the end of 2019 on a proposed PPA. As roads not within the scheme will suffer from displaced parking if the roads nearby are in the scheme, the area consulted on was wide, running from Egmont Road to Willis Avenue and Prior Avenue – including Chalgrove Road, The Ridgway, Mayfield Road, Farm Road, Farm Close, Upland Road, Kayemoor Road, Downside Road, Willis Avenue and Prior Avenue.\nThe results of the consultation are clear – in every one of the roads listed above a majority of those expressing a view on the proposals supported their introduction. In some roads – particularly Chalgrove, Mayfield, The Ridgway, Upland – this was by a large margin. In all these roads more than one in four residents responded to the study, a high response rate for such local consultation exercises, and opinion was more than two to one in support of the proposed parking controls. In other roads consulted there was a lower response rate but still majorities in favour of the proposals. Once a scheme is introduced, any individual road left out will suffer high levels of parking, so any scheme needs to cover the whole area. It is a clear result that gives the Council a mandate to proceed with the introduction of the PPA consulted on.\nThe way the PPA works is that only residents can park their vehicles in the road for a “control period”, 9 to 11 AM each day on weekdays, thus removing commuters and long stay parkers. Residents who need to park a car on the road rather than in their drive during the “control period” will need to obtain a parking permit to display on the vehicle, and many residents will want to obtain “visitors’ permits” for their visitors if the visitors need to park in the street during the control period. There are special arrangements for carers. As this scheme will involve some costs of administration and enforcement there will be a charge for a permit, to cover costs, though all residents can get an initial supply of visitors’ permits without charge. The Council can cover costs but not use parking charges to subsidise other services. Parking charges in Sutton are amongst the lowest of any London borough. Charges per vehicle are on a scale you can find on the Council website and start at £40. A similar charge in Croydon is £80, Merton and Kingston £90, Richmond £99. You only need a permit if you need to park a car in the road during the “control period.” A PPA involves notices to advise motorists of the parking controls but there is no need for yellow lines.\nResidents will receive a letter from the Council which will set out the timetable for introducing the scheme, later this year, and how to obtain permits.\nMany residents are concerned about parking and we are pleased they have now had the opportunity to put their view on a concrete proposal developed on the basis of consultation, and a clear outcome has emerged.\nSPEEDING AND POLLUTION\nWe are concerned that the removal of parking from the area will lead to clear roads that will attract more traffic and speeding. In many parts of London, though often more affluent areas, residents have campaigned to get the traffic out of otherwise quiet residential streets and onto the main roads by turning roads into cul-de-sacs, thus creating quiet roads with better air quality and no through traffic. A good example locally is the gate at the end of Dorset Road which makes Homeland Drive a quiet, traffic free road. We are interested in the proposals residents have been putting to us for consultation on such traffic initiatives in our area. Nothing is currently proposed but, as traffic continues to increase, this is the next issue we need to look at. Do let us know your views.\nGO SUTTON BUS WITHDRAWN: JOIN OUR CAMPAIGN TO KEEP THE BUS\nThe coronavirus crisis has led to the suspension of the Go Sutton bus service, as demand for the service has collapsed due to the restrictions on leaving your home and on travelling. We will petition to have it restored once the crisis is over.\nThe Go Sutton bus trial attracted massive attention. Information is at http://www.gosutton.co.uk\nThe year-long trial for this on-demand bus service had positive feedback and the service was extended to cover the area shown on the map. You could register online and phone when you want to use the bus. The cost was £3.50 (plus additional passengers at £2) but free if you have a Freedom Pass, like Richard.\n| The bus service was innovative, on-demand scheme which picked up residents close to where they lived and took them to any destination across most parts of the borough. The scheme started in 2019 and was due to end in May 2020 but Liberal Democrats in Sutton petitioned for the service to become permanent. Residents told us, especially elderly people or those with learning difficulties, that the bus scheme proved to be a lifeline for them. That’s why Liberal Democrat councillors set up a petition calling on the Mayor of London and Transport for London to make the scheme permanent.You can still sign the petition by clicking here . Apart from helping people to get around the borough, the scheme helped us to improve air quality, reduce congestion and cut down on the number of individual car journeys. Please sign the petition. |\nWHERE WE ARE ON PARKING\nTHIS ARTICLE WAS PUBLISHED IN FEBRUARY 2019. THERE ARE LATER DEVELOPMENTS COVERED IN LATER ARTICLES, ABOVE. THIS ARTICLE IS KEPT ON THE SITE TO SHOW HOW THE PROPOSALS EVOLVED.\nWe would like to again thank residents who have contributed to the two stages of consultation by the Council on parking.\nSince some misinformation has been put round in the Ward, we want to summarise where matters now stand – though all the information on the process is on the Council’s website, click on parking and follow the links to the parking strategy.\nNo decisions have been taken. We await the analysis by the traffic engineers of the results of the second consultation. As Councillors, we only want to do what residents want. We will be guided by the results of consultation and are determined not to impose our own views on this process.\nWhat we know from the first consultation is this. Much of Sutton South Ward experiences a high demand for parking as we are close to the town centre and the railway station. Parking is rationed by having a controlled parking zone (CPZ) but this leads to bumper to bumper parking six days a week in the roads just outside the zone, such as Mayfield Road. The results of the first round of consultation were consistent with previous studies by Councillors, the Council and the residents’ association, in that:\n- there is a strong majority favouring parking controls in Mayfield Road\n- there are more mixed views in Chalgrove Road and The Ridgway but, overall, support for controls\n- there are more mixed views in Upland Road and roads beyond, though less support for parking controls the further you are from the CPZ.\nThe proposals of officers was to introduce controls in Mayfield, The Ridgway and Chalgrove. It will be interesting to see whether the results of the second consultation mean that other roads, in particular Upland Road, want to join the scheme. The objective of having successive consultations was to let residents have a second opportunity to give a view when they could see what was proposed for neighbouring roads, recognising that any parking scheme will lead to some displacement.\nPrevious surveys have suggested that there is no appetite for a full CPZ with machines. The solution adopted with success elsewhere in Sutton, including in Hillcroome Road, is to have a mix of yellow lines operative for an hour a day to deter commuters, with some free to park bays. These bays are needed to cater for residents who will need to park a vehicle on the road and they also reduce the amount of displacement into neighbouring roads, which is a legitimate consideration.\nAn alternative that has been suggested is to have a “residents’ only” parking scheme with residents obtaining a permit to park during controlled hours. Disadvantages are that this scheme would involve extensive signage along the roads involved, bureaucracy, and a cost as the administrative costs of dealing with permit applications would have to be covered by charges for permits. It would also lead to more displacement. We welcome views on that alternative.\nParking has been an issue of concern locally for the 30 years Richard has lived in The Ridgway. We want to tackle this issue though recognising that it is problematic. We are consulting and will do what the majority of residents want, not impose our own solutions.\nA NEW BUS ROUTE\nWe have been asking local residents to have a look at this consultation by TfL.\nhttps://consultations.tfl.gov.uk/lsp/56861abb/\nThis concerns a possible new bus route between St Helier Hospital and Epsom General Hospital, going along Brighton Road. This would be of benefit to local residents, particularly those elderly or infirm residents who do not have a car and frequently visit one of these hospitals. I am encouraging residents to respond positively to it.",

Richard raised the issue of the reasons why a recent survey by The Times newspaper ranked Sutton as the eighth most attractive place to live in England. This finding does not surprise us. We spend a lot of time knocking on the doors of our residents to introduce ourselves as your local Councillors and we find people generally say they really like Sutton, mentioning a strong sense of community, open spaces, low crime, good schools, a green and pleasant environment, parks, street trees, being convenient for London and for the countryside. This is particularly the case with people who have moved to Sutton from elsewhere, particularly those from other London boroughs, from Hong Kong and from Ukraine. Please write to us and tell us what you like about Sutton or think we can improve.\nIMPROVING PEDESTRIAN SAFETY IN OUR WARD\nWe are always keen to look at ways of improving our Ward.\nLast year traffic engineers undertook a study of traffic flows in our Ward and the results of the exercise are listed in a later post on this site. The results have not led to some “standout” conclusion as to a problem that needs tackling but traffic officers are examining three main issues:\n- whether action can be taken to improve the safety and the experience of pedestrians crossing the Kings Lane bridge without closing the road to vehicles. The bridge is narrow. Installing a second bridge would be impossibly expensive. Marking a pedestrian path at one side of the road might be feasible. We would welcome the views of users of the bridge, both pedestrians and motorists\n- similarly, whether something can be done to improve the safety and the experience of pedestrians passing under the railway bridge in Langley Park Road. Some proposals are to be consulted on\n- possible improvements to the busy junction where Cedar Road crosses Langley Park Road. Residents have spoken to us of the difficulties pedestrians have in crossing Langley Park Road. Consultation with residents in adjacent streets is underway on proposals to install two new traffic islands in Langley Park Road. These will form a safe area in the middle of the road so the road can be crossed by pedestrians in two phases.\nYour views on these issues, and views on any other traffic and parking issues you would like us to look at would be welcomed.\nFURTHER OPEN, QUARTERLY MEETING OF LOCAL RESIDENTS AND THE POLICE\nThe police met residents of Sutton South Ward again on the evening of 15 January 2025, at Devonshire Avenue school. There are open, public meetings held quarterly at which the police discuss the policing of the Ward with local residents. We were addressed by our Ward Constable, Constable Robyn Skivens, who went through the crime statistics for the Ward. Sutton has a lower crime rate than most outer London boroughs and our Ward has one of the lowest crime rates in Sutton. However, crime always has a significant impact on the victim and public concern remains high. The draft minutes of the meeting are as below.\nSUTTON SOUTH COMMUNITY / POLICE MEETING. 15 JANUARY 2025\nAttended by PC Robyn Skivens and PCSO Helen Maguire for the police.\nA report was given on main crime trends from 1 September to the date of the\nmeeting.\nDRUG OFFENCES\nThere had been 18 drug offences, mainly possession of drugs, mainly cannabis.\nWhile this was higher than normal the increase was partly attributable to a\nspecial police operation at Sutton train station.\nFour of these crimes were the interception by the Border Force of drug\nshipments. Where such a shipment is to premises in our Ward it will count in\nour statistics.\nBURGLARY\nThere had been 21 burglaries or attempted burglaries. This included residential\nburglaries, burglaries of garages and sheds, and some burglaries of businesses.\nIt was noted that there was usually a seasonal increase in burglary at this time\nof year as it was darker earlier.\nThere had been eight residential burglaries. However, some that had been\nreported in sheltered accommodation in the Ward were later disproved and\nattributed to dementia. A disturbing case was that of a landlord who was able\nto let himself into a flat and commit theft. Two burglaries of garages had\ninvolved theft of bicycles.\nMention was made of a shop in Brighton Road where the window was\nsmashed and the wooden panel that was then put in place to secure the\npremises was pulled away to facilitate burglary. Mention was made of the\ntheft of tools from a construction site in the Ward.\nSome burglaries had involved the theft of keys, which were then used to\ncommit further offences (theft of a car key leading to theft of a car). The police\nstressed the need to make sure keys were kept out of sight – if the keys can be\nseen from your letterbox you are inviting crime.\nVEHICLE CRIME\nThere had been 14 instances of vehicle crime (theft of vehicles, damage to\nvehicles, theft from vehicles). The police stressed the need to avoid leaving\nanything of value on display in your car, or in the car at all. An unusual crime\nhad been the theft of an excavator and a dumper from the road works in\nBrighton Road.\nTHEFT\nThere had been 23 crimes in a category the police described as “theft and\nkindred (to theft)” events. This included shoplifting, parcel theft, theft of pedal\ncycles and mobile phones. Examples mentioned included theft of scrap metal,\ntheft of a wheelie bin and theft of a wedding ring by distraction techniques.\nMAJOR CRIMES\nThere had been nine major, violent crimes in the Ward. This included several\nrobberies at the train station, a large group altercation outside a restaurant, a\nfight between two drug users, and a concerning incident of a woman who was\nfollowed from the station and robbed. There were also two incidents of arson,\nof a bin and of a Ford transit. A ULEZ camera was deliberately damaged.\nThere was an incident where a drug user was searched and a knife, and bladed\narticles, were found to be in his possession.\nThere was a disturbing incident of an anti-semitic symbol being daubed on a\nwall outside the synagogue in Cedar Road. There had been a succession of\nincidents related to a woman living in Cedar Road who had engaged in anti-\nsocial activities that had attracted a community of drug users to her premises.\nThis was now the subject of police reports to the DPS that were expected to\nlead to her being charged with serious offences.\nSPEEDING\nThe police had been conducting a programme of visits to local care homes and\nsheltered housing to talk about scams. Residents had raised with them\nconcerns about speeding in Cavendish Road, which had led to police action in\nthat road. There was a discussion of speeding in local roads including\nChalgrove Road, Langley Park Road, The Ridgway and Cavendish Road. The\npolice had been carrying out speed checks in Chalgrove Road and Cavendish\nRoad. The action in Cavendish Road had led to twelve drivers receiving\nwarnings. The police would consider further action against speeding in local\nroads, subject to resources.\nOTHER MATTERS DISCUSSED\nStaffing levels: There should be in theory be a third officer on the Ward to\nsupport Robyn and Helen, but they were coping.\nThe number of “extractions” when they were called away to join police\nexercises elsewhere in London, or at the Croydon custody suite, remained an\nissue of concern but was now running close to 35% of their time rather than\nthe 50% it had once been.\nMention was made of local concern about a story that a body had been\ndiscovered at a house in Egmont Road. The police assured the meeting that\nthere was no wider implication of this incident.\nThe next meeting was tentatively scheduled for Wednesday 14 May at Devonshire Avenue school (7pm) subject to the police checking their work rota.\nThe meeting thanked Robyn for coming back from leave to attend the meeting\nand thanked the officers for their work for the community in dealing with\ncrime in the Ward. The meeting thanked Fiona Ostler for letting us meet at the school. The date of the next meeting was provisionally set as Wednesday 14 May, at Devonshire Avenue primary school and thought continues to be given to what could be done to better publicise the meeting and get a better attendance.\nSUPPORTING THE POLICE CADETS\nSutton South Councillors were concerned to learn about changes proposed to the organisation of the Police Cadets, who meet at a school in our ward. Currently there are over 120 cadets. However, the decision has been made to close junior cadets and cut the remaining senior cadets to just 46. Their future programme is also being severely curtailed. This will have a major impact on the youth of this borough who will no longer have the opportunity to participate in activities such as camps, parades and Duke of Edinburgh awards.\nCouncillor Louise Phelan, whose son has been a Cadet, commented “I’ve seen first-hand the benefits of being part of police cadets. They learn valuable life skills, and gain self confidence. They also support the local community and get to take part in things they wouldn’t otherwise have had the opportunity to do. For many this is a stepping stone into a career within the police force, for others the Cadets help to keep them on the right path and make better life decisions. I am incredibly concerned others will now not get these opportunities.”\nKINGS LANE\nRichard has been trying to get Network Rail to cut back the vegetation on the railway bank adjacent to the southern bridge in Kings Lane as it obscures sight lines for motorists. Every autumn, after the vegetation on the railway bank has grown up, he has this correspondence with Network Rail. They have now cut back the undergrowth sufficiently for cars to be able to see if there are vehicles coming towards them across the bridge.\nA CLEAN SWEEP FOR THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS IN SUTTON SOUTH WARD\nNEW HOMES LOCALLY TO MEET THE HOUSING CRISIS\nOn 30 November Richard and Trish sat as members of the Council’s Planning Committee, with Richard chairing the meeting, to consider the fate of the B and Q site in central Sutton. This is just outside our Ward. B and Q plan to close the store next June. Richard commented that, though he is no do-it-yourself fanatic, he regretted the closure of the store, but B and Q say it no longer makes them money and they have decided to close.\nIt is inevitable that the site will be developed as housing. There is no demand for new office space (more people work at home) or new shops (more people shop using the internet) but there is a housing crisis. On the day of the discussion 970 Sutton families were homeless and living in bed and breakfast accommodation, at the expense of the Council and thus our Council tax payers. More homes are desperately needed. The philosophy in the Sutton local plan is to meet our housing targets partly through a more intensive area of development close to the town centre and near the railway station. As public transport links are good in this area it is possible to envisage a car free or “car light” development – if you have to provide a parking space for every house many fewer homes can be built. This reduces development pressure on the borough’s suburban heartland and Green Belt areas. Planning Committee often considers proposals to build on the Green Belt which we resist, but the new homes must go somewhere. The more intensive development in the town centre will inevitably include some tall buildings, and there is a cluster close to the railway station.\nEvidence was presented to the committee on action taken to deal with some of the consequences of this development, such as a need for places in local schools, demands on health services and additional strain on water and sewage systems. Richard commented that there were attractive features to the proposed development, 60% of which would be open space, including an area of public parkland, a water feature, an amphitheatre and terraced roof gardens. The most important aspect, though, was the plan for 337 “affordable” homes where Sutton Council can place the most deserving of the 2 600 families on the housing register. This will include families that are homeless or those we meet, in our Ward, who are living in dreadful housing circumstances – sometimes families with three or four children living together in tiny flats.\nThe planning application was approved. Initially all that local people will observe is the closure of the store, hoardings put up round the site and the store demolished. Then there will be building work but it will be several years before anyone moves in. Eventually, it will be an attractive, landscaped site. On the website\nthere is a video of a walk through a CGI representation of what the final product will look like.\nNOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR SUTTON: PLANNING APPLICATION IN MULGRAVE ROAD TURNED DOWN\nThe owner of Chelsea Court, 54 Mulgrave Road has had planning permission to extend the building – in effect adding two extra floors to the block of flats – refused by Sutton Council. This was the latest in a series of applications in our Ward where owners of blocks of flats have sought to extend the building upwards.\nAs local Councillors, we were concerned about these proposals. While there is a need for more accommodation, the changes to the building would in our view make it look incongruous, not good enough for Sutton. The block is an attractive architect-designed building (see photo), one of the more attractive blocks in Mulgrave Road, and the proposed changes would destroy the symmetry of the building. The Planning Department at Sutton Council agreed with our objections. The changes would also have involved building work that would greatly disturb the current residents of the block.\nThe owners used a mechanism called “prior approval” when submitting their planning application. This mechanism, in our view, was introduced by the Government to undermine the planning system. As a result, we could take the application to the Council’s Planning Committee, which Richard chairs, for decision by Councillors. We may still not be able to stop these changes taking place given the powers of the remote Planning Inspectorate based in Bristol to over-ride local decisions.\nWe always seek to ensure in such cases that a number of conditions are stipulated in any planning permission, if one is ever granted, to try to protect the peace and quiet of the building during construction work. These include that access to the roof should be via an external hoist with all materials for work on the roof transported to the roof by an external hoist and not brought up via the well of the building. The interior of the building should not be a storage area or building site. There should be a construction management plan to minimize disruption to existing residents and ensure there are controls on dust and noise, and on hours of work. The contractors should join the Considerate Contractors’ Scheme. There should be a liaison officer that residents can contact if they observe poor behaviour. If scaffolding is erected outside residents’ windows it should only be erected when needed and removed as soon as it is not needed.\nWe have successfully opposed this development but wait to see if the developer will appeal to the Planning Inspectorate against the decision of the Council.\nA VISIT TO CITY HALL TO PRESENT SUTTON’S PETITION OPPOSING THE EXTENSION OF ULEZ\nLouise, Richard and Trish travelled to City Hall, the HQ of London Mayor Sadiq Khan, on 30 June to join other Sutton Liberal Democrat Councillors in presenting a petition to the Mayor. The petition, signed by over 10 000 Sutton residents, expressed our opposition to the extension of the ULEZ zone to outer London boroughs. Our views on why we opposed the extension of ULEZ can be found in posts further down this site.\nDespite our opposition, ULEZ has now been extended by the London Mayor to outer London.\nFURTHER PROPOSALS FOR NORTHUMBERLAND HOUSE\nWe are again involved in arguments over proposals to add extra storeys the top of Northumberland House.\nNorthumberland House is the tower block at the corner of Brighton Road and Wellesley Road, about 200 yards along Brighton Road if you turn left when coming out of Sutton station.\nCriterion Capital, the owners of Northumberland House, are again seeking planning permission to add two storeys to the top of the building. The owners are again seeking to extend the building, creating a further 29 flats by adding two extra storeys on the top of the ten storey part of the building and an extra storey on the lower part, with some additional flats in the “undercroft” above the parking area. Some of the current parking spaces would be lost.\nAn earlier similar application was not supported by Sutton Council on the basis of design of the proposed tower extension and issues about the alignment of the windows. Planning law allows developers to seek to over-ride the decisions of local Councillors by appealing to the remote Bristol-based Planning Inspectorate, whose decision is final. The developers went to appeal, to the Planning Inspectorate, and on 5 October Richard and Louise attended and spoke on behalf of residents at a hearing organised by the Planning Inspectorate.\nWe had noted that there would be some positives, such as the creation of a community amenity and play space on the tarmaced area at ground floor level. However, while there is a shortage of accommodation in London and more housing is needed, we were concerned that the building work had the potential to be extremely disruptive to the lives of current residents. And an extra two storeys on the top of the building looks incongruous and out of keeping with the design of the rest of the building. Richard told the Inspector the design “looked like a couple of portacabins had been dumped on the top of the building.” At the hearing we told the Planning Inspector that residents of Northumberland House are concerned about the likely disruption involved in this proposed work, and have long standing concerns about frequent lift breakdowns in the building and the general standard of housekeeping, particularly in the bin area. We pressed the Inspector to impose conditions, if he were to agree to the scheme, to protect the interests of residents, and include these conditions in any planning permission they eventually obtained. We asked that access to the roof areas would be only by external hoists, and that the peace and quiet of the interior of the building would not be disturbed or the interior turned into a storage area, or building site. We sought controls on scaffolding to ensure any scaffolding that is required is removed as soon as the requirement has passed. We insisted there must be a construction management plan to control hours of work and control noise and dust nuisance. We asked that the contractor joins the “Considerate Contractors Scheme”, which provides a route for residents to raise concerns if they observe poor behaviour. We were pleased that the developers indicated they would accept all these conditions.\nThe Inspector supported our views and commented that the proposed building looks “incongruous” – the exact wording Richard had used at the hearing. He turned down the application and also refused the application for costs.\nThe owners have now submitted a further, similar application. Residents can see the proposals via the Council’s website (go to the section on planning and follow leads to get to comment on planning applications). It is application DM2023/00796. We are keen to learn of the views of residents on this matter, particularly those who live in Northumberland House. Do contact us at the email addresses given in the first post on this site.",

BT maintains that due to an Act of Parliament they do not need planning permission for these boxes and can put them anywhere they like. They are still refusing to move the box.\nHowever, Richard saw red when he observed that BT had stuck advertising on the box.\nHe said:\n“I am not against these boxes as such, because we need them for Broadband, but some have been positioned in an unsuitable place that upsets local residents, such as the one in Cedar Road.\n“They are mostly inconspicuous but will not be if the owner flyposts the box with advertising. These boxes are all over the place and will be an unsightly mess if they are covered with advertising. If BT Openreach establish that they can flypost the boxes, all of these boxes will be covered in advertising in no time at all. It will make our streets an unsightly mess.”\nOther Councils agree that the adverts are objectionable and unlawful, but BT refuses to move them. A test case is being brought by Westminster Council to prosecute BT for unlawful advertising. In the meantime, the Enforcement Team are sticking posters over the BT posters saying “Cancelled: This sign is unauthorised and has been cancelled by the London Borough of Sutton”.\nThe photograph above shows the offending box in Cedar Road.

There is intense competition between local authorities for such inward investment, so this is good news.\nResearch shows that there are enough parking spaces at the Gibson Road car park, and the other multi-storey car parks in central Sutton, to accommodate parking thay would be displaced if the Brighton Road site closed. However any decision to negotiate further on the sale of the site would be under a transactional structure that would ensure that the car park can only be redeveloped as commercial offices in accordance with an agreed scheme, which would also be subject to normal planning regulations.\nThe company requires a site where a bespoke set of state-of-the art offices meeting its needs can be constructed. At present, no existing office building in Sutton will meet its needs.\nIt is early days and there is a long way to go on this proposal, but the proposal represents a vote of confidence in Sutton’s future. If it goes ahead, it could bring hundreds of new, hi-tech, engineering jobs to the area. Plus a real boost to local shops and restaurants. As we have more car parking capacity than people use in Sutton town centre, developing Brighton Road could make sense. But what is important is that we get a development local people are happy with and that we create more jobs, for which reason there is a long way to go in negotiations and consideration of planning arrangements before this is finalised. In particular, there will be close attention on the design and construction phase.\nHeather said, “ Opportunity Sutton is a great initiative for business in Sutton. Given our emphasis on the environment this type of investment is just what we want. We will be making sure that our residents are properly consulted. Like us they are keen to bring new life to the Brighton Road which is currently blighted by the derelict building at Sutherland House”.\nRichard, who is vice-chair of the Housing, Economy and Business Committee, said “I think this shows how attractive Sutton is to potential invstors. They see Sutton as a place with a thriving local economy, good facilities, good transport links, affordable housing, low crime and good schools. rightly voted the best place in London to bring up children two years in a row.\nThere are issues to be sorted out before this project can go ahead but it would be irresponsible of the Council not to engage with the company in negotiation.”",

There are two important aspects to this:\n– we have adopted planning policies that carefully control what types of backgarden development might get planning permission, and even this year have strengthened that policy with amendments to planning policy DM30 to ensure that aspects of character, appearance and amenity are fully considered: and\n– we have devoted significant resources to ensuring planning requirements are strongly enforced.\nTo this end, every site where an infringement of planning law is alleged is visited and the enforcement staff work carefully through the processes required by law to get any breach corrected.\nI am impressed by the statistic that in the last year the enforcement team have met their target times for early site visits in 97% of cases.\nThe processes they follow are, because of planning law, sometimes slow – but every case is doggedly pursued to its conclusion.\nThis policy, however, comes under pressure from several sources that we cannot as a Council control.\nFirst, from the legal requirements concerning what is permitted development.\nI think the reforms of 2008 took out of the planning system buildings that really ought to be within it.\nI was surprised recently when, in my Ward, a large building was built in a back garden but found – due to the dimensions and overall size of the plot, and its planned use – to be permitted development, though it has certainly affected the amenity of neighbours, some of whom are here tonight. We must be on guard against any further relaxation of permitted development law.\nIn taking forward the National Planning Policy Framework, none of us would want to see rights of permitted development widened still further, and a key point in the motion is the statement that extending permitted development rights further will reduce rather than enhance the power of the community to stop inappropriate changes.\nI am therefore delighted that the amendment to the motion calls for a full review of permitted development law.\nSecond, there are the decisions of the Planning Inspectorate – not mentioned in the motion, but I cannot let pass the opportunity to say their decisions are less consistent than I would have expected – and indeed some of their decisions have done real damage in my Ward.\nThird, the legal processes do not help. They provide those who breach planning law with myriad opportunities for appeals and delay, all of us have examples from our own Wards. And at the end of the process we sometimes face the seeming lethargy of the Courts in dealing with such breaches. All of this hinders our strong enforcement efforts and leads to a public perception that things take a long time, which affects public confidence in the planning system.\nThese are all factors we cannot control, but we must take every opportunity to make representations to seek their amelioration – and this motion is a part of that campaign.\nSo – a cautious welcome for the National Planning Policy Framework, recognising that this is a policy area central to our efforts to maintain the pleasant environment of our Borough. It is right that we should intervene in this national debate to make clear to all our determination to be able to continue those efforts to cherish and protect the green and pleasant character of Sutton.”",

He claims that that he and Heather are probably the most successful local Councillors in Britain, as few have been involved in attracting 500 new jobs to their Ward. He writes:\n“When I was elected in 2010 I observed that Sutton South is a generally affluent area but there are pockets of poverty, particularly in the social housing estates in the Ward. Many of these people are people who are at the margins of the labour market, often single mothers or people in their 50s who have been made redundant, unskilled and struggling to find work, people whose lives would be transformed if they could get back into employment. Jobs are gold dust.\nI cannot pretend that the Subsea7 proposal was something I was responsible for. But when it was proposed, I felt that to have a major, successful, expanding engineering company create 500 jobs in my Ward by building a modern, attractive HQ building, replacing a half empty car park, was something positive. So, with Heather, I had a lot of discussions with Subsea7 and we would like to think that we were responsible for many of the improvements made to the plans as they developed.\nThere were three sets of objections put to me by residents.\nFirst, Subsea7 could have gone to one of the other empty office buildings in Sutton. I discussed this with them. They had a number of technical objections, in particular that the size of their work teams meant any conventional 80s or earlier tower block would not be suitable as the teams would be spread over several floors. But it became clear to me that they wanted their own, prestige building, being prepared to spend surprising amounts of money employing a top firm of European architects to design it, and if we could not accept that they would go elsewhere – Epsom or Leatherhead seemed likely. In fact Sutton has suffered a decline in the number of office buildings, as many are converted to residential uses, and it is a bonus to have this new prestige office development.\nSecond, the development would only create jobs for engineers, and not for local people. This is not so. An office complex of this size will create jobs for cleaners, receptionists, clerks, drivers, catering workers etc. The site is surrounded by social housing estates ( Sutton Court , Beauclere House, Westmoreland Drive , Ambleside Gardens ) and local people within walking distance will be well placed to compete for these less skilled jobs. The workforce in this office complex will spend money in local shops and restaurants. The clients will come to these offices from, we are told, all over the world, spending money in local hotels and restaurants. This is the type of upward momentum the area needs.\nThird, it would displace parking into local streets to an unacceptable extent. The current evidence, in the immediate aftermath of closure, is that this has not happened. Heather and I insisted on a substantial discount being offered to drivers to move to Gibson Road , and the deal done by Reed to enable their staff to park in the underused B and Q car park has been significant. For the longer term, we know Network Rail is interested in expanding the station car park. There still is a problem of parking in some roads in the Ward, though the closure of Brighton Road has not affected it.\nFrom my point of view, my term as a Councillor ends next year and I would like to think I am leaving some legacy in the location in our Ward of such a prestige development by an expanding company, creating local jobs. There are very few Councillors in the UK who have got 500 new jobs in their Ward.”\nCAR PARKING SURVEY: SEPTEMBER 2013\nThis survey of the number of parked cars was carried out on a number of dates, between 9.30am and 10.30am, this being late enough for any commuter parking in local roads to be in place.\nThe count covers all roads in Sutton South Ward outside the Controlled Parking Zone, except those with other parking controls in place such as yellow lines preventing commuter parking.\nThe dates were as follows.

The case we put to the Planning Inspectorate, in a carefully prepared written submission, has been successful, and the Inspector has almost used the words of our submission in rejecting the case for the development proposed in Overton Road.\nWe objected to the appeal made to the Planning Inspectorate by the developers at 54-58 Overton Road, appealing against the sensible decision of Sutton’s Liberal Democrat Council to reject their planning application, which was to cram 50 dwellings onto the site while failing to offer adequate parking. This appeal followed the Council’s rejection of the scheme on 5 September, on the basis of objections we set out.\nThe Inspector has described the proposed design as “unduly bulky and dominant” and “overly large and unremitting.” The only unsatisfactory aspect of the judgement is that he appears to consider that enough parking spaces were provided, something we dispute.\nWe will continue to campaign against the demolition of family homes in the area to make way for developments that cram in low quality accommodation. And we object to the remote Planning Inspectorate in Bristol having the power to overturn sensible local decisions by your Liberal Democrat Council.",

We continue to have no dedicated Ward office above the level of PCSO. Two police attended – our loyal PCSO Laura Jogoe and PC Adam Nawol, from Cheam Ward, also came.\nAs usual, the police SNTs are seriously undermanned. Over the 4 wards, ie Sutton South, Cheam, Belmont and Sutton West, there are 1 sergeant, 5 PCs, of whom only 3 are “operational” and 3 PCSOs. There are supposed to be 8 PCs, 2 per ward. We were told that there is a PCSO recruitment campaign. Great concern was expressed by all at the meeting and we agreed to write to MPs and the Mayor of London.The police reported that in the period December to March, there were 16 burglaries and 21 vehicle crimes in Sutton South Ward. Common methods of entry included getting over a back gate and entering from the rear of the premises by breaking a door or window. We were advised to link a burglar alarm to a call centre, rather than rely on a neighbour. Car thefts were mainly opportunist, some people forgetting to lock their cars. Drugs were not viewed as a big problem, incidents being very sporadic and tackled quickly, after which the drug sellers would move on to somewhere else.",
  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_category_environment_page_12/content_150.html": "Sutherland House, at the heart of Sutton South, is a “blot on the landscape” said Councillor Heather Honour addressing the Development Control Committee on Wednesday 2nd March, a view repeated by Councillor Clifton when he spoke to the Committee on 8 June.\nThere is now a section 106 agreement in place, which we have helped to draw up, so that any developer will be required to make a contribution to the welfare of the local population. The Development Control Committee considered, on 8 June, minor changes to the conditions attached to the development proposal. We still have no timetable for the development.\nKey points we have made are that residents continue to raise concern about the state of Sutherland House and its continuing deterioration now that it is unoccupied. In addition to the large number of windows that are boarded up, the retail premises, previously occupied by an estate agent, are now also boarded up, adding to the general dilapidation of the area. This presents anyone entering Sutton from the South with an unpleasant and off putting view .\nSome residents remain concerned about the proposals that have been agreed. However, in the interests of the area as a whole, we need development to go forward, to improve the appearance of the building and as an occupied building will mean that the office workers and residents are spending money in local shops and restaurants, making the economy of South Sutton more vibrant. But we must register concern at the current state of the building and have sought to require the owners to improve the external view, e.g. more attractive boards surrounding the building.\nIn speaking to the Committee on 2 March Heather reminded the Committee of the concerns raised by residents of Grosvenor Court and Forest Dene. Heather said that the current state of the building was a disgrace. Windows were smashed and boarded up. The doorways were refuges for drinkers and smokers and full of litter. The space below the iron railings on Cedar Road was a rubbish tip and a health hazard containing unsightly and unhealthy waste from fast food outlets. And the building had been host to a cannabis factory, or even a plantation given the huge amount of the weed grown there.\nAlthough unable to revisit the details of the planning application, Councillor Honour pointed out that the car parking, consisting of 62 bays was inadequete for the proposed 96 flats and 70 bedroomed hotel. There were already serious parking issues at nearby Sutton Court and this would only exacerbate the situation.\nRoad safety was already an issue at the junction of Cedar Road and Brighton Road and many of the residents at Forest Dene feared to cross the road there. The proposed entry to the lower cark park would worsen the situation and Councillor Honour advocated using Wellesley Road for the entry to the car park.\nShe also drew attention to the fact that the original planning application had said that the hotel would be commissioned from Hilton Hotels on behalf of the Hampton brand. The latest information was that the hotel was likely to be either the Premier Inn or Travelodge chain. Would their branding conflict with the approved design of the hotel?\nHighlighting the fact that most of Sutton South was now a mixture of private flats and social housing and that there was insufficient open space in the area, she said that 50 per cent of children did not have access to a garden and she asked that under the new Community Infrastructure Levy the developer be asked to improve the Devonshire Nature Area and contribute to more open space for the surrounding community.\nOur latest information is that the development is not likely to follow the current planning permission but will be a much more limited development, reflecting the current economic circumstamces.",

Note that what you pay at Council tax band D level in Sutton is £1 447.61, including the various precepts by other authorities, less than in Tory Croydon where it is £1 456.83.”\nHeather says This shows the council’s determination to do the best for the citizens of Sutton in these difficult times, even though central government has cut our funds by £30 million.”\nWork to improve efficiency includes the ongoing Smarter Services Sutton programme which is reviewing every service to ensure that the maximum possible use is made of every pound of taxpayers’ money.\nChanges to how the authority collects waste, the introduction of self-service terminals in libraries and even sending out text message reminders to tell residents that Council tax payments are due are all examples of ways in which the council has maintained – and even improved – services while cutting costs.\nThe proposal to freeze Council tax was discussed at the Strategy and Resources Committee meeting on Monday 11 February and a final decision will be reached at full Council on 4 March. This will freeze Council tax for a fourth successive year and mean that Council tax will remain the same in 2013/14 as it was in 2009/10.\nLeader of the Council, Cllr Ruth Dombey, said: “We are very aware that prices are rising faster than incomes and residents are finding it increasingly difficult to make ends meet.\n“So we looked closely at how we can cut costs and work more efficiently and still provide the excellent services residents expect without raising Council Tax. And I’m pleased to say we have managed that for the fourth consecutive year.\n“In fact we would have liked to have cut bills, but most of Sutton’s budget comes from the Government and by 2013/14 our annual grant funding from government will have been reduced by nearly £22million since 2010/11.”",

These changes will mean less waste goes to landfill, which is good for the environment.\nGarden waste collections for paying residents will be extended from nine months a year to all year round. This will be collected in the same green and brown wheelie bin.\nStreet cleaning operations will be extended to 10pm from the current 6.30am start.\nThe new contracts will enable Sutton Council to save £10.3m over the first eight years. It is estimated that Sutton’s recycling rate will increase from 37 per cent (2014/15) to 42 per cent by the end of the first year of the contract.\nSutton Council has agreed to the shared service approach with its neighbours due to the unprecedented Government cuts to the Council’s budget, along with the opportunities to increase recycling rates.

Richard is to chair the new Audit and Governance Committee while Trish is a member of the important Housing, Economy and Business Committee. Steve Cook, who was Deputy Mayor when Richard was Mayor in 2016, was elected Mayor. Richard moved the nomination. This is his speech.\n“Madame Mayor, I wanted to begin my remarks by echoing what many others have said about the grace, dignity, hard work and commitment you have brought, with Councillor Heron, to the Mayoralty this year.\nSo let me turn now to another Councillor who, I know, will bring commitment and hard work to the Mayoralty in this coming year, if Council accepts my nomination tonight.\nIt gives me great pleasure to nominate, to be Mayor of the London Borough of Sutton for the year 2018-19, Councillor Steve Cook.\nI cannot resist beginning by saying that if you do accept this nomination it will be the second time in three years that the Mayor of Sutton has been a Muswell Hillbilly, as Steve and I discovered we share a common birthplace, a maternity hospital (sadly later demolished) in Alexandra Park Road in Muswell Hill, in north London. And for those too young to recognise the reference, “I’m a Muswell Hillbilly” is a song made famous by The Kinks pop group, who hail from Muswell Hill, and famous Muswell Hillbillies include Steve and myself, obviously, Ray and Dave Davies of The Kinks, Adam Ant and Alvin Stardust – so a really distinguished company of people.\nLet me tell you about Steve. Steve was born on the Queen’s coronation day, so every birthday is the anniversary of the Coronation, of Sir Edmund Hillary climbing Everest and of the D-Day landings.\nHe left school as a teenager after the tragic death of his father and after he had himself suffered a major, life threatening illness. He became a runner in the Soho film business and was such a great success that by the 1980s he had his own large scale, thriving post production studios, in Soho, in London, and in Los Angeles.\nBut Steve is a drummer, and in a particular milieu, Steve is famous, famous for the Steve Cook Soul Band, formed in 1975. The Steve Cook Soul Band was effectively the “house” band at the Grosvenor House Hotel in Park Lane for over twenty years, the industry favourite for charity balls and awards ceremonies, performing at numerous awards and film industry functions.\nI am told that at its height it had 17 members including musicians and go-go dancers.\nThere are many stories about the band. There is a story that in the 1980s they played at the Istanbul Advertising Awards ceremony, followed by a live televised gig at the Istanbul Hilton, and an international incident was narrowly avoided when the skimpily clad go-go dancers were featured on the front page of the Turkish equivalent of the News of the World.\nThe band lasted from 1975 until its last gig in 2010 – 35 glorious years.\nSteve became a Councillor in 2015 after being Chair of the local residents’ association which successfully campaigned against a huge McDonalds drive-through in Wallington.\nNow in some London Boroughs there is a tradition that whoever is Deputy Mayor one year then becomes Mayor the following year. We have not constrained ourselves in that way in Sutton but of course Steve was, with Councillor Patel, Deputy Mayor just over a year ago, so he has the experience to avoid the traps and be a great Mayor. And his wife Pauline, who had a distinguished career in education in Sutton – headteacher at Robin Hood infants school for twenty years and at Thomas Wall Nursery school for eight year – brought great dedication to the role of Deputy Mayoress, and will be an excellent Mayoress.\nMadame Mayor, I nominate Councillor Steve Cook.”",
  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_2019_06_05_the-councils-consultation-on-parking/content_460.html": "WHAT HAS HAPPENED SO FAR\nThe Council decided that, as parking is often raised as a problem in the regular surveys of the views of residents on what they like about living in Sutton, it would ask all Sutton residents if parking was a problem in their road and what they would like done. The first round of consultation led to the traffic engineers proposing a parking control scheme in just three roads in this area – Chalgrove Road, The Ridgway and Mayfield Road. As there seemed to be no appetite for the full CPZ with machines, as in Langley Park Road, what was proposed was yellow lines operable for one hour a day to remove commuters and “long stay” parkers. There would also need to be bays where people could park at any time, to cater for those residents who have insufficient drive space and need to park a car on the street all day during the day. This is the scheme in Hillcroome Road.\nThese proposals were not given sufficient support by residents for the Council to have a mandate to proceed with them. Majority opinion in Chalgrove Road was against and, with about a third of residents responding, there was a roughly equal split of opinion in The Ridgway and in Mayfield, small majorities for in Mayfield and against in The Ridgway. The Council would only want to proceed with such a scheme if there was clear and strong resident support. Paradoxically, residents in Upland Road were keen to be included in any parking scheme for The Ridgway and Mayfield.\nWHAT HAPPENS NOW\nResponses to consultation suggested that a major problem with the proposals was the free bays, which were seen as a magnet for commuters and long stay parkers, squeezing out residents. The alternative to schemes that all have this disadvantage is a residents-only Permit Parking Area.\nThe way this works is that only residents can park their vehicles in the road for a “control period”, usually one or two hours each day on weekdays, thus removing commuters and long stay parkers. However, residents would need to obtain and display a parking permit on any vehicle they want to park in the road during the “control period”, and obtain “visitors’ permits” for their visitors. As this scheme will involve the costs of administration and enforcement, and it is only fair that these are borne by those who benefit from the scheme, there is a cost for a permit. The charges would be designed just to cover costs and policy is that they will not increase in the future by more than the index of prices. The cost of a first permit in the current CPZ area is £40 which contrasts with £90 in both Kingston and Merton, £99 in Richmond, £80 in Croydon. Studies consistently show that Sutton is one of the cheapest places in London to Park.\nThe Council will consult residents on this proposal. Some residents will not see this as a price worth paying to remove non-resident parking and will not support the scheme. That is understandable – we are not making any recommendation but just want to see if residents would or would not support such a parking control scheme.\nIn Sutton South Ward, the Council will consult residents in Chalgrove Road, The Ridgway, Mayfield Road, Farm Road, Upland Road, Kayemoor Road, Farm Close, Willis Avenue and Prior Avenue, in September, on whether residents want this scheme in their road. The proposed Permit Parking Area also extends into Belmont Ward, to Egmont Road.\nFor Willis Avenue, Prior Avenue, Kayemoor Road, Downside Road and Farm Close – the results of earlier consultation did not suggest a strong push for parking controls in these road, but residents are still being asked their view on whether they would now favour your road being included in any Permit Parking Area. There was a lower rate of response from these roads, perhaps because the Stage 1 proposals for parking controls in The Ridgway and Mayfield Road were thought to have limited implications. The displacement of parking, particularly if the Permit Parking Area extends to Upland Road, and the fact that numbers of vehicles parked is continuing to gradually increase, could have an impact in the medium to long term, also noting current housing developments in central Sutton. So the Council is again taking the views of residents of these roads.\nWe are not making any recommendation – as local Councillors we simply want to do what a majority of our residents want. We hope residents will respond to the consultation, in September, so we have a full picture.\nThere is an event to explain the proposals at Sutton library on 27 June.",
  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_category_health_page_4/content_392.html": "Homeland Drive, Belmont\nIn earlier posts on this site we have set out our concerns about the proposed closure of the Grove Road and Belmont surgeries, used by many residents of our Ward, and opening of a replacement surgery in a building in Homeland Drive, in Belmont. This is of particular concern due to the high proportion of over 75s in our Ward (a higher percentage than for any other Ward in Sutton) and the lack of any GP surgery in the Ward. There is a problem of access to the site, which is poorly served by public transport.\nAt the Council’s Strategy and Resources Committee on 11 February and at the Council meeting on 3 March Richard and Heather repeated their opposition to the proposal and pressed for improvements to the proposed community transport scheme. This would go some way to ameliorating our concerns.\nIn speeches to Council on 3 March both Richard and Heather expressed concern that the doctors did not seem interested in proposals from Ruth Dombey, our Council leader, to help find a better alternative site.\nWe are writing to NHS England and continuing our campaign within the decision-taking structures of the NHS. Here is the text of Richard’s speech to Council on 3 March summarising our position.\n“Councillor Honour and I, as Councillors for Sutton South Ward, have consistently opposed the move of the two surgeries to the Henderson hospital site. Our Ward has the highest proportion of elderly residents of any Ward in Sutton and there are many residents of our Ward who go to the Grove Road or Belmont surgeries. Our objection to the site is that it is not sufficiently accessible by public transport. What has been offered by way of a community transport service, to deal with this problem, is a help but does not resolve the problem.\nThis motion applauds the efforts made by Councillor Dombey to resolve this issue, and I would like to warmly support that sentiment.\nThis is a decision taken by local doctors who work within the National Health Service. I understand from the evidence that NHS England gave to the Council’s Scrutiny Committee last year that the doctors have to put their case for the move to NHS England. Councillor Honour and I have written to NHS England to remind them of their responsibilities in this matter and ask them not to endorse this decision.\nThe local authority has come into this by the back door in three ways. First, as local planning authority, because the doctors need planning permission for the building. I sat through the discussion at the Development Control Committee and respect the fact that the Committee concluded ultimately that there were insufficient planning grounds to turn down the application. Its decisions are subject to appeal to the Planning Inspectorate so it cannot capriciously ignore the published planning policies. Second, I understand that the authority is a joint owner of the site but legal advice is that the Council would be in breach of contract were it not to proceed to completion of the sale – if the decision is taken, by the doctors and the NHS, to go ahead with this move. Third, the offer of Councillor Dombey to act as a mediator. I still hope that will be taken up.\nSo the spotlight has to focus on the decision-taking processes in the NHS.\nCouncillor Honour and I have written to NHS England to remind them of their responsibilities in this matter and urge them consider alternatives to this decision.”\nHere is the text of our letter to NHS England.\n“Unsuitable Location for Proposed GP Surgery in Sutton\nAs Councillors for Sutton South Ward in the London Borough of Sutton we are deeply concerned at proposals to close two GP surgeries and replace them with a new medical surgery at a site unsuitable for many of our residents.\nThere is at present no GP surgery in our Ward, which has the highest proportion of residents aged over 70 of any Ward in the Borough of Sutton. Our residents use a number of local surgeries but many go to the surgery at Grove Road in the centre of Sutton and to the Belmont surgery, close to Belmont railway station. These are to close, under the proposals.\nThe proposed new medical centre is in Homeland Drive, at the site of the former Henderson hospital. However, the site is not sufficiently accessible for the elderly and those without a car. It is rated PTAL 1b, which means that it is not accessible to public transport. It is in fact at least 300 metres up a steepish inclined road that is dark and uninviting. Our GPs state that 75% of patients will use a car. The remainder are likely to be elderly, unable to drive a car, or on a low income. They also are likely to be amongst the most frequent patients at the surgery.\nThere are severe limitations on the use of dial-a-ride and taxicard, so use of these services is not an option for people who find it difficult to access public transport and this site.\nThe statistics on the population of the Ward illustrate the problem. Sutton South has much more sheltered housing, and more care homes than other parts of the Borough. 2.94% of Ward residents live in managed residential accommodation compared to a Borough average of 0.78%. Over 75 per cent of properties in Sutton South are flats, many of them single occupancy. 46.3% of households in Sutton South are single person households, with 15.5% occupied by people over 65. The population of the Ward is elderly.\nSutton South Sutton average National average\nOver 65s 17.49% 14.32% 16.74%\nOver 75s 10.62% 7.07% 7.96%\nOver 85s 4.13% 2.1% 2.31%\nAlthough 73% of residents in the Borough say they are ‘well connected’, 10% of respondents in Sutton South say “they have no one to turn to locally for help”, compared to a Borough average of 6%. This means that they would not have people to assist them with transport.\nWe therefore consider that the proposed site for the new GP surgeries does not meet the needs of the most vulnerable in our Ward and we would prefer a more accessible site.\nFrom the information that we have received it does not appear that the GPs have considered the transport needs of their elderly patients, a growing demographic, who will need to use the surgery often, possibly as much as once a week for visits to the other services at the centre as well as their GPs. Many have said to us that they will need to change their doctor if this goes ahead.\nIn response to our concerns the developer of the site, Assura, has offered a community transport scheme. However, after close examination of this, it does not appear to be a practicable solution.\nOnce again the NHS, which declares that it is patient centred, is failing its patients by not taking account of their transport needs. This has been a major local issue in the abortive Better Services Better Value plans to change the status of our local hospital, St Helier.\nIt is by no means clear to us what the process is in the NHS to take a wider view of the optimum location of GP surgeries in the interests of the patients. However, we understand from evidence that NHS England gave to Sutton Council’s Scrutiny Committee last year that NHS England have a role. We would therefore like to meet you to discuss how you conside that these proposals meet the needs of our most vulnerable residents and your most needy patients.\nYours sincerely.\nRICHARD CLIFTON\nHEATHER HONOUR”",

He pointed out out that we have strong planning controls in Sutton designed to maintain the pleasant, green, suburban character of the Borough, but that the Portas review and the proposals of the Local Government Association in response to it highlighted additional controls that would be useful. He noted that, on many of the specific proposals in the Portas review to re-vitalise shopping centres, Sutton was well placed – having strong links with local businesses, a mix of retail shops, banks, restaurants, leisure facilities, markets and events, good transport links and parking facilities.\nBrighton Road High Street\nHeather drew attention to the difficulties in Sutton South Ward relating to the continuing failure to re-develop Sutherland House (see the photo above) and hoped that the new powers we were seeking would improve our ability to influence situations like Sutherland House.\nParking\nIn another debate, we welcomed a review that is to be undertaken of parking controls in Sutton. A subject that is of great interest to residents.\nWe noted that Sutton has low charges for parking, relative to most London Boroughs, issues fewer penalty notices than any other Borough, and that the accounts for parking charges roughly break even, so these charges do not subsidise other Council services We both drew attention to our wish to introduce specific parking schemes in Suton Court and Eastleigh Close.\nThe text of the motion on planning was:\nSupporting local businesses\nProposer: Jayne McCoy\nSeconder: Richard Clifton\nThis Council notes the findings of the Portas Review and supports the Local Government Association’s response proposing a five point plan for our high streets.\nThis Council has produced its own response to the Portas review with specific recommendations it intends to implement locally in particular:\n- That the Council support the Business Improvement District (BID) Steering Group in its application to become a Portas pilot.\n- That we build up a package of tailored support for District centres.\nThis Council welcomes the devolution of powers in the Localism Act to improve our local area and supports the Local Government Association’s call on the Government to now go further by giving Councils the power to protect our high streets and district centres, specifically:\n- To introduce new powers to enable councils to tackle the clustering of premises such as betting shops, fast food takeaway and late night off-licenses, and limiting the power of the planning inspectorate to overturn local community decisions.\n- To improve existing planning powers, including Article 4 and to introduce a new umbrella use class, in to which local authorities can add types of premises they consider to be problematic in their area.\nThereby allowing us to defend the diversity of our high streets and district centres and ensure they are thriving and sustainable for years to come.\nCouncil calls upon the Leader to write to the Secretary of State for Communities to press for these important new controls.",

There are many residents of our Ward who commute to central London for work and approach the station from the Wellesley Road direction, so have the same experience every working day as Richard had. But opening the side entrance will also make The Quadrant and the bike rack more accessible.\nToday, 25 July, is likely to be seen as the day we were able to be sure the side entrance will open next year.\nToday there was the first meeting of the Sutton Gateway project board, of which Richard is a member. There were discussions involving the Council, Network Rail and Transport for London. It was confirmed that the firm intention, now, is to open the side entrance. The project is more complex than simply putting a row of entrance gates where the shutter closing the side entrance is currently situated. There will be some re-building of the side entrance, a canopy, gates and the very steep flight of stairs (too steep to comply with the Disability Discrimination Act) will be replaced by a flight at right angles to the current flight of stairs, at a more gradual gradient.\nRichard said “This is exciting news for Sutton South residents. The campaign we started in 2010 has succeeded.”",

This consultation is called the Sutton Link and seeks views on bringing the tram to Sutton, or developing what is called a new Bus Rapid Transport (BRT) route. You can respond to the consultation at\nhttp://www.tfl.gov.uk/sutton-link\nCouncillor Whitehead, the Chair of Sutton Council’s transport liaison committee, and Sutton Council officers will be meeting with TfL London Buses in the New Year to discuss how bus services can be tailored to meet future development proposals in the borough. It will also provide an opportunity to raise any issues related to any shortcomings with existing services. A similar meeting has been held in previous years but Councillor Whitehead tells us a more thorough review of outer London services is now promised by TfL.\nThis is an opportunity to set out views on any changes we would like to see made to services in the area, including changes to frequencies or the duration of services, or route diversions/extensions to provide missing connections.\nOfficers will consider how this information is presented to TfL. However, the final decision on any such changes rests with TfL and there will be limited resources available.\nLocal residents in Sutton South Ward have raised with us the following concerns when consulted in the recent past.\nRoute frequency – although residents have commented that on some routes, such as route 80, frequency and reliability is good, bus 470 is seen as too infrequent, being only about every half hour.\nSimilarly, route S4 could be more frequent.\nA further difficulty with the 470 is that it does not run on a Sunday so our suggestions for the 470 are to increase the frequency from once every half an hour, run it on Sundays and (see below) extend it to Epsom hospital.\nThe X26 bus to Heathrow is used by many and the increased frequency of the X26 is welcome, but the buses have difficulty in keeping to the timetable, perhaps because of the length of the route. Some residents say they would not use it if travelling to Heathrow to catch a plane as it is not 100% reliable. There may thus be a case for increasing the frequency further.\nRoute length – could the 470 go to Epsom hospital rather than Epsom market as there are residents who use it to go to the hospital?\nOn route 151, the frequency and reliability is generally good but the service could be improved if some rush hour buses turned round at North Cheam, bearing in mind that the 213 duplicates the 151 onwards to Worcester Park.\nTimetabling – it is noted that the 80 and 280 buses running northwards along Brighton Road frequently arrive at the same time. Could the timetabling be looked at?\nPassenger information – it has been pointed out that the two bus stops in Mulgrave Road close to Sutton station do not include digital displays on bus arrival information. Although there are other ways of getting this information, on your mobile phone, not all passengers have the skill to get this.\nA review of the information arrangements was suggested for some routes. On route 164, at some stops the bus is recorded as a minute away or due but it does not turn up for six or seven minutes.\nOther matters – There has often been comment on arrangements at Sutton station. A resident suggested that congestion in Mulgrave Roadcould be alleviated by moving the taxi rank. It would be possible to move it to The Quadrant now the side entrance to the station is open, but this would probably be unpopular with the taxi drivers and railway passengers, and was not a proposal pursued under the Sutton Gateway project. A resident also commented that this part of Mulgrave Road has on occasions been briefly flooded during very heavy downpours. I have asked Council engineers to investigate.\nA summary of these comments, by bus route, is:\n470 – increase the frequency from once every half an hour, run it on Sundays and extend it to Epsom hospital\n151 – the service could be improved if some rush hour buses turned round at North Cheam, bearing in mind that the 213 duplicates the 151 onwards to Worcester Park\n80 and 280 – buses running northwards along Brighton Road frequently arrive at the same time so review the timetabling\n164 – review the information arrangements as at some stops the bus is recorded as a minute away or due but it does not turn up for six or seven minutes\nS1 – review the way the timetable is set out on the website\nS4 – review the frequency.\nIt should be noted that while this summary is focussed on suggesting improvements, many residents have commented to us in favourable terms on the frequency and reliability of local bus services.\nWe have put this digest of views forward to officers for consideration. Any decision rests, of course, with Transport for London.",

This was the latest in a series of applications in our Ward where owners of blocks of flats have sought to extend the building upwards.\nAs local Councillors, we were concerned about these proposals. While there is a need for more accommodation, the changes to the building would in our view make it look incongruous, not good enough for Sutton. The block is an attractive architect-designed building (see photo), one of the more attractive blocks in Mulgrave Road, and the proposed changes would destroy the symmetry of the building. The Planning Department at Sutton Council agreed with our objections. The changes would also have involved building work that would greatly disturb the current residents of the block.\nThe owners used a mechanism called “prior approval” when submitting their planning application. This mechanism, in our view, was introduced by the Government to undermine the planning system. As a result, we could take the application to the Council’s Planning Committee, which Richard chairs, for decision by Councillors. We may still not be able to stop these changes taking place given the powers of the remote Planning Inspectorate based in Bristol to over-ride local decisions.\nWe always seek to ensure in such cases that a number of conditions are stipulated in any planning permission, if one is ever granted, to try to protect the peace and quiet of the building during construction work. These include that access to the roof should be via an external hoist with all materials for work on the roof transported to the roof by an external hoist and not brought up via the well of the building. The interior of the building should not be a storage area or building site. There should be a construction management plan to minimize disruption to existing residents and ensure there are controls on dust and noise, and on hours of work. The contractors should join the Considerate Contractors’ Scheme. There should be a liaison officer that residents can contact if they observe poor behaviour. If scaffolding is erected outside residents’ windows it should only be erected when needed and removed as soon as it is not needed.\nWe have successfully opposed this development but wait to see if the developer will appeal to the Planning Inspectorate against the decision of the Council.",

He said:\n“We all know the importance to Sutton of maintaining a through rail service to north London.\nI want to stress the importance of links to St Pancras International as St Pancras develops further as an international rail hub.\nOver the next few years there will be a positive mushrooming of international rail travel from London. If the current plans of Deutschbahn and Eurostar come to fruition, by 2014 it will be possible, on arriving at St Pancras, to have a choice of services to travel from London to Amsterdam.\nIn addition to the current services to Brussels and Paris there will also be services from London to North Germany. This is a big market in terms of business travel. At present, each day, about 30 planes fly from London’s airports to destinations in north Germany, carrying about the same number of people as could be carried by just a few trains, using the Velaro D trains that are being built to provide rolling stock for these new services from London, by the train manufacturer Siemens at its Dusseldorf factory, which in fact I visited recently.\nAside from the potential importance of these international links to the residents of Sutton, there are international companies that have significant centres of their enterprises in Sutton – Sutton, a thriving London suburb, offering office space much cheaper than that found in the centre of London, less than half an hour by train from the centre, with a pleasant ambience and environment, and a location from which – importantly – you can reach the centre of Brussels in just two train journeys, one taking about 40 minutes and one about 2 hours. And the centre of Paris in just 15 minutes more. And soon – Amsterdam, north Germany.\nNow, these are transport links that it is vital for Sutton to maintain, for the sake of our residents but also to maintain our attractiveness as a centre for business development. When I look at the data on economic activity that comes regularly to the new Housing, Economy and Business committee, some clear conclusions stand out. It is clear that Sutton is doing relatively well in terms of surviving the recession and maintaining one of the highest rates of economic activity on the part of its residents of any part of London. But we need to continue to attract new businesses.\nThe Tramlink extension is perhaps equally important, particularly in relation to the north Sutton site, which is an attractive site, and on which the Housing, Economy and Business committee now has a task group working on the planning brief. Our current plans include scope for a Tramlink stop at the site, something that will greatly enhance its appeal, and we see this development as an important part of our future growth strategy.\nSo we must keep pressure on TfL to continue work on the feasibility of the Sutton Tramlink proposal, and make clear to the Department for Transport that changes that remove our linoks to north London and in particular to St Pancras, are not acceptable.\nThe Thameslink service is absolutely vital. Losing it would sever our only direct link to North London and would mean Sutton residents would need to take at least two trains to get to St Pancras. It is quite scandalous that, at a time when we should be improving public transport, there is a serious proposal to cut the link between North and South London.”\nWe need to act now as the Department for Transport is currently consulting on the new seven-year Thameslink franchise which will run from September next year and incorporate the Southern franchise from 2015.\nIronically, the cross-London Loop Line service which runs through Sutton, Carshalton and Hackbridge stations, was recently reopened at nights and weekends after being split for three and a half years by engineering work. It is all very well reopening it now, but Sutton’s residents need the line to stay open for good.\nThe new franchise will set service patterns for 2018 and beyond, so it is vital that we act now and do not become a Cinderella area for rail transport.\nTo view the DfT consultation document visit www.dft.gov.uk/consultations\nTo give your input into Sutton’s response, email alex.forrest@sutton.gov.uk\nRichard and Heather will be submitting their own response.\nMore detail about the attitude the Council is taking, opposing this threat, is in a further post on this site “Train Links To North London Must Remain” (see archive July 2011).\nHeather and Richard outside Sutton station",

The painting, on the railway bridge at Sutton station, is not easy to photograph, so what is shown below is a CGI of the artwork created before the painting was undertaken. What is above, is the painting.\n| The railway bridge at Sutton station has been brightened up with a painting by the renowned artist Lionel Stanhope, whose art has brightened up many railway stations. Stanhope completed the painting in four days starting on 26 May. Stanhope is regarded by many as a better and more important street artist than Banksy. We have been pleased to support this project which brings an attractive feature to add interest to the area.The façade of the railway bridge, as you come out of Sutton station and turn left,was a patchwork of various colours. The Council first tried to interest Network Rail in making the bridge look more attractive, over four years ago, during the “Sutton Gateway” project, which involved re-paving the area around the station and the installation of the clock opposite Sutton station. The artwork has been mainly funded by Network Rail, with a small contribution from Sutton Council. The parapet of the bridge required extensive cleaning and preparation before the painting commenced. Lionel Stanhope produced a design which incorporates the word “Sutton” in the typeface traditionally used by Southern railway, and a depiction of the historic Sutton locomotive. The locomotive “Sutton” came into the possession of the Council many years ago and is a 144 year old, 28 tonne, 26 feet, A1 class Terrier steam engine. It is currently with a heritage railway undertaking in Tunbridge Wells who have undertaken to restore it. The painting is an addition to an area becoming famous for its street art. Within two hundred yards you can find the remarkable statue “The Messenger”, located directly outside the entrance to Quadrant House in The Quadrant. The Messenger is a statue, a sculpture in bronze with very dark patination, completed by David Wynne in 1981, of a large horse and rider. It was a major commission for the sculptor, who died in 2014. It took four years to complete from his first idea and inspiration, on receipt of the brief – through roughing out, refining and casting in a foundry, to the final unveiling and installation. We are not including a photograph of the statue in this post due to the philistine attitude of the owners of Quadrant House, who do not cherish this artwork and have stuck a notice on the front of it about some aspect of building maintenance, thus disfiguring it. They have been unco-operative in the face of requests to remove the notice. Even more striking is the remarkable mural by the famous Spanish “street” artist from Bilbao, Eva Mena, on a wall in nearby Wellesley Road. This is said to be of the American singer and musician Erykah Badu. The work was commissioned by the owners of the building, Indepth Hygiene Services. It was painted in three days in 2010, when the artist came over from Spain to paint it. It is entirely typical of her street art, which is to be found on walls in many parts of the world, including Egypt, Ireland and Spain, as well as Sutton. Eva Mena is said to be more famous than Banky in her native Spain. |\nCHANGES TO RAIL SERVICES FROM SUTTON STATION\nThere is continuing consultation being carried out by Southern and Thameslink on changes to the timetabling of trains from Sutton station. There is a further consultation on changes to weekend and late night services which you can find at\nThis website invites comment on the changes. The website gives no closing date for comments but we understand that this will be 18 December.\nTRISH LEADS THE FIGHT FOR A BETTER TRAIN SERVICE\nMany of our residents commute to London by train, and the combination of good schools, low crime, a green and leafy borough and proximity to local railway stations is what attracts many London commuters to Sutton South Ward.\nFor this reason we are concerned at the reports we get from many residents that the train service is not adequate. Both of us have, at times, been commuters into central London and we know the frustrations. In September Trish made an impassioned speech to Sutton Council on the problems residents have experienced, quoting the stories residents have shared with us of cancelled services and broken down trains. The Council called on the Government to review the franchise of Southern Railway and Govia, and implement stringent penalties for failure to deliver an adequate service.\nSince Richard was elected he has fought successful campaigns to save the Thameslink service and to get the side entrance to Sutton station open. We are now campaigning to get Network Rail to increase the capacity of the station car park. We want to monitor the performance of the railway so please continue to contact us with your thoughts and experiences.\nCOUNCIL OPPOSES THREATENED CLOSURE OF SUTTON STATION TICKET OFFICE\nSouthern have been consulting on certain changes to Sutton station that will involve the closure of the ticket office. The details are on their website at\nRichard and Trish have helped draft the response from the Council, opposing this change. The following is an extract from the lengthy and considered Council response.\n“The Council strongly objects to the proposed closure of Sutton ticket office. Sutton is the 6 th busiest station on the Southern network and 7th busiest in south London, having almost 7 million passenger entries and exits per annum. The Council has major growth plans for Sutton, a Metropolitan town centre, in terms of housing and employment, which will result in a significant increase in station usage over the next decade. The Council has also recently completed the Station Gateway scheme at Sutton, which made some significant improvements to area outside the station, as well as opening the side entrance. The ticket office at Sutton is well used most of the time and there is often a queue. We consider that the ticket office at Sutton should remain open during the peak times at least, and this should include the busy periods at weekends when there are a considerable number of leisure and infrequent passengers who do not have smartcards and may need advice or help. Outside peak times sufficient staff should be available on the concourse to sell tickets and assist passengers with the machines. As the station concourse in front of the ticket barriers at Sutton is quite small and congested we would suggest having a station host desk or podium in the existing ticket hall with a formal queuing system as for the ticket office. Many stations in your “Model 3″ outside London have much lower usage than Sutton yet are to retain their ticket office, and we consider it is important that this major London Metropolitan town centre should retain a ticket office facility.”\nWe have reproduced below some of the key points made by Southern, taken from their website. Most residents use the train service from Sutton station from time to time and those we have discussed this issue with support our view that this is a proposal we should object to.\nCHANGES AT SUTTON STATION\nSouthern point out that the majority of customers use ticket machines rather than the ticket office. They propose to establish a “station hosting point” with the staff available on the concourse, able to sell the full range of tickets from first to last train. They propose to move staff onto the concourse as ‘Station Hosts’\nThe website states that Station Hosts will be:\n- visible and available from first service until the last, which is longer than current ticket office hours\n- trained in customer service\n- able to sell tickets and provide information using a new handheld device\n- helping passengers use the ticket machines\nSutton station will have a Host on duty at specified times, Monday to Friday 5.25 to 23.00, Saturday 6.25 to 23.00, Sunday 7.00 to 23.00, these being in excess of the current ticket office hours as the ticket office closes at 9pm. The Host will provide assistance with ticket purchases, information provision and assisted travel. The Host will have a hand held ticketing system that will enable them to provide tickets that are not available from the self-service machines.\nThe Ticket Office will close. The primary point for purchasing tickets on the station will be from the self-service machines or from the Station Host. In the event that a ticket type is not available through these machines then the Host will have access to a ticket office machine within the concourse area to enable those ticket types to be issued.\nSouthern State “At some of our stations we know that our ticket offices sell fewer than 12 tickets per hour and the vast majority of customers don’t use the ticket offices on a daily basis. At these stations, we want our staff to become more available for all users of the station and ensure there is a visible presence on our station concourses where they can help customers with all of their queries, provide information, offer assistance and have the ability to sell tickets when needed.\nAt some of our busier stations, we want to relocate the ticket selling equipment to a station hosting point so the staff are available on the concourse, able to sell the full range of tickets but for longer times than today.\nWe believe that this will provide an improved customer experience, with all the affected stations being staffed from the very first to last train, 7 days a week. Facilities such as waiting rooms will be open for longer and Station Hosts will be available answering customer queries, providing advice and assisting with ticket purchases.”\n“GATEWAY” PROJECT COMES IN ON BUDGET\nThe £1.2 million Sutton Gateway project – largely financed by Transport for London – has come in £8 000 within budget, a remarkable degree of accuracy.\nThe main success for Sutton South Ward residents, in particular those who commute to central London, is the opening of the side entrance to Sutton station. The side entrance is now open from 6am to 11pm seven days a week. The cycle racks next to the side entrance have been improved and the number of racks doubled.\nThe project further developed the area around Sutton station with:\n– newly planted trees to improve the look of the area\n– more lighting and CCTV cameras to make the area safer\n– extra cycling facilities, with new bike racks and shelters\n– the town centre clock\n– a re-arrangement of the bus stops to reduce congestion\n– re-design of the Cedar Road / Brighton Road junction to improve visibility for motorists\n– after 6.30 some taxis can park immediately opposite the station, with the bus stop previously opposite the station moved further down Brighton Road to ease congestion of buses at peak times\n– the timing of the pedestrian crossing at the High Street / Grove Road / Sutton Court Road junction has been amended to give more time to cross\n– the number of parking spaces in the station area has been increased\n– general improvements in design and to the “public realm” around the station, with more flowers, more colour and better signage\n– new “legible London” signs based on this design, still to be installed.\nThese changes are largely funded by grants the Council has obtained, not local Council tax payers.\nThe results of the earlier consultation exercise on the Gateway Project indicated general support for the scheme, but we were able to make a number of changes to respond to specific issues raised. In our Ward, a particular concern for the businesses was the need for a loading bay on Regents Parade just south of the station. We successfully lobbied for this to be incorporated into the scheme.\nThe improvements attributable to the Gateway project are complemented by the installation of the new zebra crossing in Cedar Road, which was not part of the project.\nNEW CROSSING IN CEDAR ROAD – COMPLEMENTING THE GATEWAY PROJECT\nAfter a long campaign initially led by Richard and former Councillor Heather Honour, more lately by Richard and Trish, the new zebra crossing in Cedar Road is there. This project began some years ago when we obtained funding for a survey of traffic speeds in the Ward which identified Cedar Road and Cavendish Road as speeding hot spots. The new traffic islands in Cavendish Road have reduced speeds. People will doubtless think the Cedar Road zebra crossing is part of the Sutton Gateway project, but in fact it is a separate project.\nThe Gateway project should be completed in the next month and has smartened up the station area.\nThe project aims to further develop the area around Sutton station, including by:\n– refitted shop fronts, new paving and newly planted trees to improve the look of the area\n– more lighting and CCTV cameras to make the area safer\n– extra cycling facilities, with new bike racks and shelters\n– a town centre clock\n– less crowded pavements and bus shelters\n– a new crossing in Brighton Road.\nIS THE TRAIN SERVICE DETERIORATING ?\nMany Sutton South residents commute into London for work so the quality of the train service is vital to us.\nWork continues to improve Sutton station, with the new side entrance now\nto be opened for longer hours and the Sutton Gateway project improving the\nlook of the front of the station. But residents in Sutton South Ward who\ncommute into London tell us that the quality of the train service has deteriorated in the past 6 months. Just two years ago our campaign to\npreserve the Thameslink route from Sutton through to north London was\nsuccessful, but now the quality of service\nhas fallen. Paul Burstow, Trish and Richard have started a new campaign to fight for better rail services. We have been handing out surveys at Sutton train station to get residents’ views. If you have an experience to share, get in touch – specific examples will help the campaign\nSIDE ENTRANCE TO THE STATION OPEN\nHere is Councillor Simon Wales, chair of the Sutton Gateway Project Board (on which Richard represents Sutton South), cutting the ribbon to open the side entrance on 26 September.\nAnd, below, this is what it used to looks like – shuttered and barricaded.\nWork is completed and the new side entrance to Sutton station is open. Hooray.\nA further meeting of the project board guiding the Sutton Gateway project, a board on which Richard represents Sutton South Ward, heard on 25 September that good progress is being made with the scheme.\nThe most important news is that the building work on the side entrance is completed enabling the passageway from The Quadrant to be restored and the side entrance to be opened for passenger use. The side entrance is open from 7am to 7pm.The cycle racks next to the newly opened side entrance have been improved.\nWork at the front of the station commenced in September and will be completed by March 2015, but with no work over the Christmas period to avoid any inconvenience to shoppers. Some of the work will involve traffic diversions.\nThe project’s proposals to further develop the area around Sutton station include:\n– refitted shop fronts, new paving and newly planted trees to improve the look of the area\n– more lighting and CCTV cameras to make the area safer\n– extra cycling facilities, with new bike racks and shelters\n– a town centre clock\n– a new crossing in Brighton Road\n– the opening of the side entrance to Sutton station\n– new “legible London” signs\n– a re-arrangement of the bus stops to reduce congestion\n– an additional crossing for pedestrians outside the station\n– re-design of the Cedar Road / Brighton Road junction to improve visibility for motorists\n– it is not proposed to move the taxi rank, except that after 6.30 some taxis will be able to park immediately opposite the station, with the bus stop opposite the station moved further down Brighton Road and with some buses stopping in Mulgrave Road\n– there will be “live” bus information in Sutton station, subject to further research by Network Rail\n– the timing of the pedestrian crossing at the High Street / Grove Road / Sutton Court Road junction will be amended to give more time to cross\n– the number of parking spaces in the station area will be increased\n– general improvements in design and to the “public realm” around the station, with more flowers, more colour and better signage.\nThe changes, including the changes to the bus stops, will be completed by March 2015.\nThese changes are largely funded by grants the Council has obtained, not local Council tax payers.\nThe results of the earlier consultation exercise on the Gateway Project indicated general support for the scheme, but we were able to make a number of changes to respond to specific issues raised. In our Ward, a particular concern for the businesses was the need for a loading bay on Regents Parade just south of the station. We successfully lobbied for this to be incorporated into the scheme.\nOn 27 February Richard and former Ward Councillor Heather Honour organised a breakfast meeting with local businesses in our Ward to take their views on the Sutton Gateway project. Several joined us in the Rose Café in the Brighton Road, which serves excellent scrambled eggs (Richard’s breakfast). This is right in the area that is to be developed so we were able to chat and walk round the area to see the proposed changes.\nPublic consultation on the emerging proposals ran till 5 March. Consultation was by leaflets in the locality, questionnaires to members of the public, posters, newspaper advertisements, exhibitions, further “stakeholder” meetings and putting information in Sutton station.\nResidents and businesses close to the station were consulted, together with the emergency services and other groups with a major interest such as Network Rail, Southern Rail and TfL.\nAlso of great value will be the “legible London” signs at the station entrance. See the designs at\nhttp://www.tfl.gov.uk/microsites/legible-london/3.aspx\nRichard says “As a local man who for twenty years of my life commuted to central London by a route that meant I walked every working day along Wellesley Road and past the shuttered and barricaded side entrance, to enter the station from the front, it has long been an objective of mine to get the side entrance open. Every second counts when you are a commuter.”\nSUTTON STATION PROJECT STEAMING AHEAD\nSince they were elected Richard and Heather have campaigned for the opening of the side entrance to Sutton station. We are now reasonably certain that this ambition will be realised by next February.\nOn 10 September Richard attended the Project Board for the Sutton Gateway Project. This project is designed to improve the “Gateway to Sutton” from the south, along the Brighton Road and around Sutton station. The main elements include:\n– opening the side entrance to the station\n– further development of the facilities for cyclists\n– re-design of the steep steps up to the side entrance so they are at an acceptable angle\n– better landscaping, street furniture and paving around this area and the station entrance area.\nThe station manager confirmed that the side entrance would be manned from 7am to 7pm and at other times open but monitored on screens at the front entrance.\nRichard says “For twenty years of my life I commuted into London for work, walking every morning past the barricaded and barriered side entrance round to the front to catch (or just miss) my train, and in the evening – since the station is officially classified as overcrowded – shuffling in a mass of people to get out the front. All our local residents who commute to London, walking down Wellesley Road from the east end of the Ward, will benefit from the overdue decision to open the side entrance. And it will benefit all those who arrive at Sutton station to work in The Quadrant.”\nThe project will also involve some re-design of the Cedar Road junction, long a concern of ours, and a “stakeholder group” to include trepresntatives of the South Sutton Neighbourhood Association and the Highfields Residents’ Association will be asked to comment on design issues.",

There has been a programme of pruning of the trees in the Ward over the autumn and winter period, in the light of the survey.\nMany new trees have been planted in the Ward in the last year. This has included new trees in Farm Road, Devonshire Avenue, Effingham Close, Prior Avenue and Kayemoor Road.\nThe many trees in our Ward are a delight, and help give us the pleasant, green, suburban feel that is so attractive.

This applied for the vast majority of pupils eligible for the voucher.\nAt half-term, during the autumn term, Richard and Trish were horrified that the Conservative Government refused to back Free School Meals for hungry children during the half term break. Liberal Democrat-run Sutton Council stepped in to provide Free School Meals for local children during the holidays. This new scheme, over the Christmas holidays, follows on from that earlier provision.\nFootballer Marcus Rashford has spearheaded the campaign that brought national attention to children living in food poverty.\nLocal councils are under huge financial pressure across the country, with the Government only providing half the funding required to support additional COVID-19 related services. It was not true that the Council was funded to provide free school meals at half term. That funding was received back in July for families who needed extra support and had to be allocated within twelve weeks. It wasn’t nearly enough at the time and it certainly wasn’t intended to cover the cost of feeding hungry school children at half term in October.

The move aims to help protect local people from the quick cash companies and avoid sky high interest rates.\nRichard welcomed the move, calling again for new controls on payday loan companies.\nHe pointed out that figures released as part of Sutton Council’s “Economy Watch – Economic Indicators” report show an alarming rise in debt enquiries from Sutton residents to the Citizens Advice Bureau. Richard said, in a letter to residents, “I am increasingly concerned that people are turning to these companies without looking into the real costs of borrowing money, which in some cases that I have investigated are well over 1000% APR.”\nSpeaking to the Council’s Housing, Economy and Business Committee about the latest data on Sutton’s economic performance, on 18 June, Richard pointed out that enquiries to Sutton’s Citizens Advice Bureau were up by about 5% in the last quarter with debt enquiries increasing by 8.8%. There has to be a fear that recent welfare cuts will make the position worse.\nIn a letter to residents he called for consideration to be given to establishing by law some upper limit on the interest rate that can be charged on loans.\nThe Leader of Sutton Council, Councillor Ruth Dombey, said: “Payday lenders prey on people who are at their most vulnerable and in need of quick financial assistance. Sometimes people don’t realise the trouble taking out one of these irresponsible loans can do for them in the long run. A small initial loan can lead to thousands of pounds of debt and an irreversible downward spiral.\n“This is a small yet significant step towards protecting local people from these companies. I’d urge anyone who needs advice to speak to their bank or the local credit union.”\nPeople who live, work or study in Croydon, Merton or Sutton can start saving at the CMS Credit Union. Credit unions are savings and loans co-operative businesses that are committed to promoting saving rather than borrowing. Anyone who saves with a credit union becomes a member.

We spend a lot of time knocking on the doors of our residents to introduce ourselves as your local Councillors and we find people generally say they really like Sutton, mentioning a strong sense of community, open spaces, low crime, good schools, a green and pleasant environment, parks, street trees, being convenient for London and for the countryside. This is particularly the case with people who have moved to Sutton from elsewhere, particularly those from other London boroughs, from Hong Kong and from Ukraine.

The branch to Sutton would leave the current Wimbledon to West Croydon Tramlink route at that point, proceed via St. Helier Avenue to the Rosehill roundabout, then to Angel Hill and on to Sutton, where it will go round the gyratory. There will be a loop from the Rosehill roundabout to St. Helier hospital.\nFull details can be found at www.suttonmertontramlink.co.uk or by clicking on this link.\nIf agreed and built, phase 1 may be followed by phase 2, an extension to the re-developed Sutton hospital site in Belmont. This is as yet far into the future. We remain hopeful that funding will be found for phase 1.\nEARLY SUCCESS FOR CAMPAIGN TO BRING TRAMS TO SUTTON\nSutton Council’s campaign to bring trams to the Borough is celebrating an early success.\nPlans to extend the existing Tramlink network to Sutton have been included in the Mayor’s new vision for London document, “2020 Vision – The Greatest City on Earth”, published last week. It outlines some of the challenges facing the capital, including housing, employment and transport.\nSutton Council, business and residents support the tram extension, which will improve transport links in and out of, and across, Sutton. The project will also create and sustain new jobs, drive economic growth, ease traffic congestion and reduce CO2 emissions.\nWe understand the original draft of the Mayor’s vision document made no mention of bringing the tram to Sutton, but our Tramlink campaign, still in its infancy, has already yielded a result. The Mayor of London is asking us to demonstrate how this investment will be justified by the improvements it can bring in terms of jobs, growth, and housing.\nSutton is already one step ahead. We have commissioned research which demonstrates that extending Tramlink to Sutton will create 10,000 jobs, bring forward sites for residential development, and support and boost the economy.\nWe know that extending Tramlink will ensure Sutton continues to prosper into the future. The Borough of Sutton has had an ambition to bring Tramlink to Sutton since 2003 when it was included in the Unitary Development Plan. The Borough has successfully worked with Transport for London to examine the feasibility of bringing trams to central Sutton, connecting it to St Helier Hospital, Morden Tube Station and Wimbledon. At some point a spur through our Ward, Sutton South, would connect to the Marsden hospital. This feasibility work is ongoing, and Sutton’s Tramlink campaign seeks to ensure the Mayor will continue to fund this work in Transport for London’s future budgets.\nPROMOTING THE SUTTON TRAMLINK\nSutton Council has made public detailed plans for an extension of London Tramlink to the town. The plans were made public at a meeting on Thursday 23 May attended by Councillors, local business leaders and the Under Secretary of State for Transport, Norman Baker MP, who was at the launch event to give the project his backing. .\nThe planned route would run from the existing Tramlink Croydon-Wimbledon line at Merton through Rosehill and St Helier, Angel Hill, and Sutton High Street to a terminal at Sutton station. A later second phase would link the town centre to the Royal Marsden Hospital.\nThe tram connection would cut local journey times and costs, reduce pollution on the streets of Sutton and help regenerate areas such as the St Helier Estate by encouraging investment, improving access and widening the job market in the areas concerned.\nThe extension through our Ward to the Marsden hospital would be of importance as it is expected that the development of a research centre at the Marsden will create many local jobs.\nThe Tramlink is a major plank in the “Opprtunity Sutton” programme, which Richard is closely involved with as vice-chair of the Housing, Economy and Business Committee.",

Currently, Subsea7 are applying for planning permission to build a new international headquarters (see above) on the site.\nRichard pointed out that this development will safeguard several hundred jobs currently in Sutton that were likely to move elsewhere, and bring a further three to four hundred jobs into Sutton South Ward. These new jobs are good news for Sutton.\nThis development will create jobs, not just for engineers but a range of less skilled jobs (clerks, receptionists, cleaners, messengers, drivers etc.). This site is surrounded by areas of social housing where we meet, in our casework, people who are out of work and whose lives would be transformed by finding work. Every day we open the newspaper and see news of more redundancies nationwide – but Richard and Heather can speak of securing an extra 300 plus jobs in our Ward. The development will also give an uplift to the area, the Gateway to Sutton from the south, with office workers and the company’s clients spending money in local shops, restaurants and hotels, creating further jobs.\nBut the second message is that to deal with local concerns about parking in local streets if the car park closes, we need to persuade the users of the Brighton Road car park to use the town centre car parks, which have the capacity. The average weekday demand at peak occupancy of the car park is about 380 vehicles and 320 have season tickets. So the season ticket holders are key.\nThe first and most important element in the strategy is a financial discount to persuade people to move. The discount proposed by the Committee, as a recommendation to the Strategy and Resources Committee, says to the season ticket holders “move to Gibson Road and you will pay, for the first year, what you paid last year less 10% – unless, you already have a discount, in which case it continues. This is to compensate you for the inconvenience of moving and to provide an incentive to move to Gibson Road”.\nWe hope this will persuade people to move, to a car park which is no more than seven minutes walk away.\nThe further element of the strategy is improvements in respect of signage to the car parks (including electronic signs indicating what number spaces are available) and improvements in access, in particular enabling those leaving Gibson Road to avoid the town centre one way system.\nWe hope this proposed substantial discount will achieve the right result, so that we will be able to secure the major advantage of the new jobs while coping with the reduction in parking space. The structure of discounts will, however, be further considered by the Strategy and Resources Committee.",

While we need these boxes for Broadband, local people have expressed strong feelings about the way this box is erected right outside the resident’s front window.\nA post on this website (see archive for May 2011) describes the general problem related to these boxes, but we are aware that BT/Openreach can, due to an Act of Parliament, ignore planning law in erecting the boxes. Sutton Council wrote to them last November with objections to the proposal to erect this box in Cedar Road as it contravenes Department for Transport guidance. BT seemingly ignored the Council’s objection, which they can legally do, though they have maintained that in a discussion with a member of staff of the Council the objection was later withdrawn. These objections related only to comformity with planning guidance and not the wider problem of the impact of the box on the amenity of local residents. Within a 100 yard radius of the box there are four old-style green boxes in appropriate positions that do not cause any problem to residents. Local residents felt that the box could have been erected alongside one of those.\nThe street meeting was attended by local residents, including the occupant of 39 Cedar Road, Councillor Clifton and Councillor Colin Hall, who deals with these issues on the Executive of Sutton Council and has been in touch with other Councils that have similar problems across London. Jack Hamilton, former chair of Sutton South Neighbourhood Association and a local resident, also attended.\nTwo people from BT/Openreach, Giles Ellerton and Adrian Paice, came to the meeting. The argument they put to the local residents was an entirely technical argument that technical problems, related to avoiding digging up pavements where there are high-voltage cables and required distances between cabinets, prevented them from putting the cabinet in any other position.\nLocal residents were suspicious of the argument put, in that it is a technical argument by the people who have the technical expertise, and consequently no-one present had the expertise necessary to assess its validity. There was also a feeling that if the occupant had had hard standing for a car in front of her house, as the house next door does, this would have prevented BT/Openreach from erecting a cabinet in that position – in which case they would undoubtedly have found some other solution, not just given up.\nIn email exchanges after the meeting an offer has been made to the resident of 39 Cedar Road of compensation for particular aspects of the inconvenience she has suffered. However this is very limited and we understand she is not likely to accept it.\nCouncillor Clifton, whose pressure led to the meeting being set up, comments as follows:\n“This meeting has not resolved the problem. I can take some positives from it.\nFirst, BT/Openreach have, under pressure, now met local residents and explained in much greater detail than we have had before why the box was erected where it is. This makes it possible to seek more information and a technical opinion on whether their argument stands up, something we will do.\nSecond, alerted by the problem here, I will ask Sutton Council officials to advise me as a local Councillor of the locations of any further boxes to be erected in Sutton South Ward so I can look at the proposed locations. BT/Openreach seem to have been usually quite responsible in assessing locations, which makes it particularly disappointing that they cannot resolve the Cedar Road problem – a particular, and severe, problem.\nFinally, the meeting has led to a very limited offer of compensation. That is, however, a matter for those involved to discuss.”\n[ A tense moment during the road meeting, at which there was a frank and open exchange of views between local residents and BT/Openreach staff. Councillor Clifton, on the right, puts a point to Giles Ellerton of BT/Openreach. ]\nAs this website page comes up quite frequently on a basic BT Box Google search, i’d just like to add a damage report on this particular situation which was never really proclaimed loudly enough.\nBT Openreach installed this box, blowing a gas main in front of the house. Months on it was realised that they had broken the main Virgin Media telephone connection in to the house concerned. This took approximately 3-4 months to figure out (by Virgin, who will win no awards for efficiency here and have still refused to compensate the owner for their lack of service which was being fully paid for).\nFollowing a further visit to the property by BT, following a high level Newspaper expose’ which followed by a television appearance on “The Wright Stuff”, a high level BT team visited to find another spot for the box. The final outcome was there was nowhere suitable (I stress that this was purely their opinion and not one of any other competent installation company).\nThe meeting forced a promise by BT Openreach that they would fix the damaged two year old wall that they admitted breaking however they have ignored any request to do so since then.\nIf anyone at BT has any sense of community spirit and respect for the local people and planning laws (as they consistently claim to have) then fix the wall you broke or forever remain in the minds of the local people as a corporate bully interested in only what you can get away with, and your shareholder’s profits",

The Inspector awarded the Council costs on the grounds of the unreasonable action of the developers.\nRichard and Heather have appealed to the developers to now get on with the re-development of the site taking on board the Inspector’s views – that we need some affordable housing and a better design for the units in Cedar Road.\nRichard spoke at the appeal hearing on 17 July.\nThe Council supported the re-development of Sutherland House as residential units but argued for some affordable housing and that the proposed development fronting on to Cedar Road included accommodation of a quality that was not acceptable. The Inspector supported the Council on both points. The Inspector accepted a financial analysis of the viability of the project that showed there was sufficient profit to make it possible to include some affordable housing.\nRichard says “The views of the Inspector accord exactly with the case I put to the hearing. I feel vindicated, in saying this proposal was not good enough. The developer will make a lot of money from turning this building, close to the town centre and Sutton station, into luxury flats. The appraisal accepted by the Inspector showed there can be some affordable housing included without threatening the financial viability of the project. As a Councillor, I meet local families living in extremely overcrowded conditions and we desperately need more affordable housing. The building has been empty too long and I call on the developer to now get on with it and come up with a scheme that reflects the Inspector’s decision.”",

Currently there are over 120 cadets. However, the decision has been made to close junior cadets and cut the remaining senior cadets to just 46. Their future programme is also being severely curtailed. This will have a major impact on the youth of this borough who will no longer have the opportunity to participate in activities such as camps, parades and Duke of Edinburgh awards.\nCouncillor Louise Phelan, whose son has been a Cadet, commented “I’ve seen first-hand the benefits of being part of police cadets. They learn valuable life skills, and gain self confidence. They also support the local community and get to take part in things they wouldn’t otherwise have had the opportunity to do. For many this is a stepping stone into a career within the police force, for others the Cadets help to keep them on the right path and make better life decisions.

  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_2025_03_03_the-council-budget-approved/content_17.html": "On 3 March the Council discussed the budget proposals for the coming year. Legally, the Council is required to set a balanced budget. With so many Councils going bust or in great financial difficulty, this was always going to be a difficult task. The problems are due to a legacy of Government cuts but also a big spike in demand for services. While people think of the Council as the body that mends the potholes, empties the bins and fixes the street lights, 70% of spending is on adult social care and children’s services (particularly for those children with special educational needs), plus the cost of finding accommodation for the homeless. There has been an increase in demand in the past year, particularly in the number of adults whose social care has to be paid for by the Council, the number of children with special educational needs and in the number of homeless families.\nRichard spoke in the debate, on homelessness – a subject in which he has a special interest due to the work history of his daughter, Ellie, who worked for many years for a homelessness charity and because as chair of Planning Committee he has a role in increasing the supply of affordable family accommodation.\nHere is Richard’s speech:\n“I would like to direct the attention of Council to paragraph 8.11 of the supplemental agenda which is discussing financial risks.\nIt says that the biggest driver of overspending by London boroughs is the number of people presenting as homeless and who need to be offered temporary accommodation.\nThe paper tells us Sutton had 1 084 households homeless and in temporary accommodation in October last year. It is a higher figure tonight. It is a frightening figure. Tonight we are discussing homelessness as a financial risk to the Council, but we all recognise that the fundamental reason for our concern is that behind so many of these cases are stories of tragedy, of families losing their homes and often winding up in bed and breakfast accommodation remote from their workplace and remote from the schools their children attend.\nThere is a housing crisis and we need more homes. Residents comment on the number of new flats being built in the centre of Sutton but we need this accommodation.\nThe aspiration of the Government to build more homes is right – but it has to be tempered by a concern about quality and about dealing with the consequences.\nSutton is very built up. It is not always easy to see where the new homes will come from, particularly when we are all rightly sensitive to the concerns of residents about inappropriate development and the pressures intensification can bring.\nIt is worthwhile re-stating the principles in our local plan for Sutton.\nWe need more housing, but it must be of good quality – good enough for Sutton, which means of high quality.\nWe aim to reduce development pressures on what I call the “suburban heartland” of the borough by concentrating development in the areas where development is appropriate.\nIn particular there is a zone of potential intensification close to the town centre where public transport connections are good. This may mean some tall buildings. It may mean car free or car light development as you can provide much more accommodation if you do not have to provide a parking space for every unit, and this is more acceptable in areas close to the railway station and the town centre where public transport connections are good.\nWe have a local plan, currently under review, which sets out how we meet the requirements for infrastructure to support an increase in population, which is an important concern of residents.\nI am always keen to point out that our local plan is not like the local plan you might find in, for example, North Korea, mandating what will be built. It is aspirational. It depends on developers bringing forward proposals. Its success depends a lot on the skills of our planning staff in negotiating with developers to secure what is good for Sutton, which may not be what makes most profit for the developer. I would like to pay tribute to the work of our planning staff and in particular the head, Andy Webber, who retires this month.\nIn the past year the planning system has had a bad press. The Government says we are going for growth, growth, growth. Quite right. But when asked what are the impediments to growth they invariably cite the planning system – which is represented as run by NIMBYS frustrating necessary development. That might well be the case in some places – not here in Sutton of course. But I think there is a counter argument that the planning system is a bastion against having fields and fields of sub-standard housing, as that is what makes money for developers. We destroy the planning system at our peril. But it is also right that we need a planning system that does not stand in the way of necessary change and renewal, but ensures high quality and appropriate development, to provide housing and to stimulate the economy.\nI think we have a good track record in Sutton in supporting high quality development and there are many examples in our borough of developments characterised by good design providing quality housing and infrastructure. That is what we need.”",

The last time this happened it enabled us to introduce some measures to calm traffic in Cavendish Road. From Monday 19th February the tubes seen in this picture taken in The Ridgway, integral to traffic measurement equipment, appeared in many local roads at the eastern end of the Ward. The tubes collected data for seven days on the volume, speed and classification of vehicles.\nThe results of the exercise are listed below. The results have not led to some “standout” conclusion as to a problem that needs tackling. Traffic officers are examining three main issues:\n- whether action can be taken to improve the safety and the experience of pedestrians crossing the Kings Lane bridge without closing the road to vehicles. The bridge is narrow. Installing a second bridge would be impossibly expensive. Marking a pedestrian path at one side of the road might be feasible\n- similarly, whether something can be done to improve the safety and the experience of pedestrians passing under the railway bridge in Langley Park Road\n- possible improvements to the busy junction where Cedar Road crosses Langley Park Road.\nYour views on these issues, and views on any other traffic and parking issues you would like us to look at, are invited.\nThe traffic survey yielded three pieces of data on traffic movements at 17 locations in the part of Sutton South Ward east of Brighton Road.

Any Sutton resident who encounters a rough sleeper can contact Streetlink, who will provide an outreach worker and refer the rough sleeper to the appropriate council in order to arrange accommodation and support.\nThe call to residents comes as Sutton Council launches a new service to help single homeless people from Sutton access the private rented sector. Vulnerable people from the borough that are identified as rough sleeping will be offered dedicated support to find suitable accommodation, negotiate with landlords, complete tenancy agreements. THEYcan receive help towards paying initial rental deposits.\nThe new measure is in addition to Sutton Council’s existing Sutton Rough Sleeping Group which was set up last year to help rough sleepers enter accommodation and rebuild their lives. The group brings together agencies that work with rough sleepers, including drug and alcohol services, Sutton JobCentre and voluntary organisations.\nAt this time of year, rough sleepers are at much greater risk from illness or even death due to exposure to freezing weather conditions.\nWe set up the Sutton Rough Sleeping Group to help those individuals move into suitable accommodation and now we have increased support. The service is providing much needed support to help them overcome difficulties such as ineligibility for social housing and expensive private rental costs.\nAlthough we do not have large numbers of rough sleepers in Sutton, many of them often seek out open spaces like parks. Due to this, the council is seeking help from members of the public to notify them of anyone that is rough sleeping.\nAnyone who sees a rough sleeper should first call Streetlink on 0300 500 0914.\nRichard has a particular interest in rough sleeping and homelessness, partly because his daughter Ellie is the communications manager for st. Basil’s, the largest homelessness charity in the West Midlands. He led the scrutiny carried out by the Housing, Economy and Business Committee of the Council’s policies on avoiding homelessness, which showed that a change to the policy (leading to people becoming homeless and being put in B and B accommodation before all legal steps were concluded) promoted by Conservative Councillors would have increased homelessness in Sutton.",

Berridge was an engineer who travelled the world and contributed to many important civil engineering projects worldwide, including the building of tunnels under the river Hudson in New York in 1902 and the development of the port of Aden – in modern day Yemen – in the ensuing decade. He settled in Sutton in the 1920’s to work on housing development for the London County Council. He is noted in civil engineering circles as the inventor of equipment for the testing of concrete, based on principles which are still relevant to modern day equipment used for this purpose.\nTrish said “We favour naming roads after celebrated local people and think it is appropriate to name this road after an interesting and distinguished man who once lived here, and made a significant contribution to civil engineering.”\nHarold Berridge was born in 1872 and went to the City of London school. After serving a pupilage in civil engineering from 1890 to 1893 he became the resident engineer at Poole Harbour in 1893.\nAfter working as an engineer for companies including John Mowlem & Co. and the City and South London Railway in the period to 1898, he became Assistant Superintendent supervising the approaches to the Hudson Tunnel, in New York, in 1902, before becoming Chief Engineer to the Aden Port Trust in 1904. He was involved in work in Aden through to 1924, after which he worked on housing development schemes for the London County Council through to 1931. During his time in Aden he was awarded the OBE.\nThe Times of 20 June 1949 reports his death, on 17 June 1949, at 8 Worcester Gardens, Sutton, Surrey. Worcester Gardens stood on the site now occupied by the Subsea7 building in Brighton Road, and was a turning off the Brighton Road. Berridge lived in a Victorian house in Worcester Gardens.\nBerridge is remembered for his patents relating to principles and equipment for the testing of concrete, including one dating from 1925 under the title “Contractible and expansible supporting means suitable for use in the construction of pipes, tunnels, bridges and other bodies or structures.” In 1932 he submitted an important patent entitled ”Apparatus for Testing the Strength of Materials.” His equipment for the testing of concrete was based on principles which are still relevant to modern day equipment used for this purpose.",

  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_author_richardclifton_page_13/content_810.html": "On 20 November Sutton Council debated the subject of homelessness.\nThis is the text of Richard’s speech.\n“During my year as Mayor I was continually struck with admiration for the massive contribution to Sutton made by volunteers. Volunteers for a great range of organisations, and in particular volunteers for organisations like Nightwatch, like the Street Pastors, like Sutton Community Works, and like the food banks, all of whom are dedicated to helping the poorest and most dispossessed in our society.\nBut I could never escape from a feeling that in a rational and caring society organisations like the food banks and those providing in effect soup kitchens and advice for rough sleepers and those with no resources, like Nightwatch, would not exist. They would have no clients. How is it that in an affluent society like Britain we are such an unequal society that we have people in such poverty that they need food banks to feed themselves and they lose the roof over their heads, reduced at worst to rough sleeping, at best to the local authority finding them emergency bed and breakfast accommodation probably some miles from Sutton.\nThis would be an entirely academic observation were it not for the fact that this problem is not diminishing, it is increasing. Not just in Sutton, but nationally.\nThe statistics for Sutton show that in April of 2015 the number of homeless households the Council had placed in temporary accommodation stood at 280, a year later it was 411, last week it stood at 581. But it is not a Sutton problem, it is a national problem. It is everywhere.\nAs a Councillor I have found increasing casework concerning families given notice to quit and that the Council then has to place in emergency accommodation often miles from their roots, miles from the schools their children attend, miles from their employment in Sutton. In one recent case I dealt with this eviction appeared to be largely because the family had complained to the landlord about the all pervading damp in the flat.\nWhat can be done to turn the tide ? What local authorities and volunteers like Nightwatch can do is no more than picking up the pieces. The Council has the difficult task of finding accommodation. When I was Chair of Planning Committee three years ago one of the decisions we took, controversial at the time and I recollect it was not without opposition, was to convert the Oakleigh home to be a hostel for families in need of emergency accommodation. But we would need many more Oakleighs now just to meet the increase in that need since that time.\nThe failure here, leading to the problem escalating, is a failure of policy. It is the welfare and housing policies of central Government that are failing to address the problem and leading to its escalation.\nI could spend a long time detailing these failures – the bearing down on those already in poverty through the benefits freeze and through changes to support of those unable to work due to disability and illness, the introduction of Universal Credit in a way that is most concerned to save money, the loss of the Council’s stock of social housing due to the right to buy, the decline nationally in the construction of new Council houses and affordable homes, which we are trying to address here in Sutton with our ambitious programme to build the first new Council homes in 30 years. Changes to the Local Housing Allowance. The loopholes in planning law that enable developers such as those who refurbished Northumberland House in my Ward to evade requirements to provide any affordable homes atall. The list goes on. It is part of a war on what my generation cherished as the welfare state.\nMy colleague Councillor Fivey, who sadly cannot be here tonight, has had discussions with Nightwatch since the organisation was formed and assisted in their obtaining £586.13 from the Council through the Neighbourhood Grant programme to pay for the tent, a gazebo, from which they operate three nights a week in our Ward, providing food and help to rough sleepers and others without resources. Current discussions about the best practical further help for Nightwatch, and other organisations, will continue.\nWe all support the work of Nightwatch but there is no logic in expressing our support for organisations like Nightwatch while not mentioning what should be done to stop these problems occurring in the first place, which is to change Government policy.”",

He pointed out out that we have strong planning controls in Sutton designed to maintain the pleasant, green, suburban character of the Borough, but that the Portas review and the proposals of the Local Government Association in response to it highlighted additional controls that would be useful. He noted that, on many of the specific proposals in the Portas review to re-vitalise shopping centres, Sutton was well placed – having strong links with local businesses, a mix of retail shops, banks, restaurants, leisure facilities, markets and events, good transport links and parking facilities.\nBrighton Road High Street\nHeather drew attention to the difficulties in Sutton South Ward relating to the continuing failure to re-develop Sutherland House (see the photo above) and hoped that the new powers we were seeking would improve our ability to influence situations like Sutherland House.\nParking\nIn another debate, we welcomed a review that is to be undertaken of parking controls in Sutton. A subject that is of great interest to residents.\nWe noted that Sutton has low charges for parking, relative to most London Boroughs, issues fewer penalty notices than any other Borough, and that the accounts for parking charges roughly break even, so these charges do not subsidise other Council services We both drew attention to our wish to introduce specific parking schemes in Suton Court and Eastleigh Close.\nThe text of the motion on planning was:\nSupporting local businesses\nProposer: Jayne McCoy\nSeconder: Richard Clifton\nThis Council notes the findings of the Portas Review and supports the Local Government Association’s response proposing a five point plan for our high streets.\nThis Council has produced its own response to the Portas review with specific recommendations it intends to implement locally in particular:\n- That the Council support the Business Improvement District (BID) Steering Group in its application to become a Portas pilot.\n- That we build up a package of tailored support for District centres.\nThis Council welcomes the devolution of powers in the Localism Act to improve our local area and supports the Local Government Association’s call on the Government to now go further by giving Councils the power to protect our high streets and district centres, specifically:\n- To introduce new powers to enable councils to tackle the clustering of premises such as betting shops, fast food takeaway and late night off-licenses, and limiting the power of the planning inspectorate to overturn local community decisions.\n- To improve existing planning powers, including Article 4 and to introduce a new umbrella use class, in to which local authorities can add types of premises they consider to be problematic in their area.\nThereby allowing us to defend the diversity of our high streets and district centres and ensure they are thriving and sustainable for years to come.\nCouncil calls upon the Leader to write to the Secretary of State for Communities to press for these important new controls.",

But the same survey showed problems in other local roads.\nThe committee agreed to a survey of the area by traffic engineers, charged with finding out the facts and coming back to the committee by next February with costed proposals for dealing with the problem.\nWe persuaded the committee to extend the survey to a wider area. The roads to be surveyed now are:\nCavendish Road\nChristchurch Park\nCedar Road\nCumnor Road\nDevonshire Road\nDevonshire Avenue\nEgmont Road\nThe committee noted that any recommendations could cost money and decisions would be needed on priorities for spending.\nRichard said “This is a good result. I am pleased we are going to undertake a full survey and get the traffic engineers to look at a range of solutions.”\nHeather added “I am pleased we are going to look at a wider area. Residents in Cumnor Road and Christchurch Park have also complained to us as ward Councillors about the speed of traffic in their roads.”\nThe petition was signed by 77 residents of Cavendish Road calling for action on the speed of traffic in their road, where a number of blocks of sheltered housing for the elderly are situated.

Trish was first elected in 2014 and was re-elected in 2018 and 2022. Louise was elected in 2022. Richard served as Mayor of Sutton for 2016-17 and Trish was our Mayor for a record three yearly terms, to May 2023. Louise is our Deputy Mayor for a second successive year, through to May 2025.\nLouise, Richard and Trish at City Hall presenting the petition opposing ULEZ signed by over 10 000 Sutton residents\nCONTINUE DOWN THE PAGE TO OUR CURRENT NEWS STORIES\nOR CLICK ON THE LINKS BELOW TO GO TO OUR SPECIFIC PAGES\nThe statue “The Messenger” by David Wynne, in The Quadrant, is close to the boundary between our Ward and Sutton Central Ward\nOn 10 April there was a remarkable victory for the Liberal Democrat candidate, Richard Choi, in a by-election to elect a Councillor for Sutton Central Ward on Sutton Council. Sutton Central Ward is immediately north of our Ward, Sutton South.\nRichard got more votes than all the other six candidates added together. The result was\nLiberal Democrats 1291\nConservatives 327\nReform 282\nLabour 216\nThree other candidates (the Greens, an independent and the Christian People’s Alliance) each got less than 100 votes.\nThe Liberal Democrat share of the vote increased by 17.4%, the Conservatives fell by 10% and Labour – who finished second in this seat in 2022 – by 17.4%.\nOn 3 March the Council discussed the budget proposals for the coming year. Legally, the Council is required to set a balanced budget. With so many Councils going bust or in great financial difficulty, this was always going to be a difficult task. The problems are due to a legacy of Government cuts but also a big spike in demand for services. While people think of the Council as the body that mends the potholes, empties the bins and fixes the street lights, 70% of spending is on adult social care and children’s services (particularly for those children with special educational needs), plus the cost of finding accommodation for the homeless. There has been an increase in demand in the past year, particularly in the number of adults whose social care has to be paid for by the Council, the number of children with special educational needs and in the number of homeless families.\nRichard spoke in the debate, on homelessness – a subject in which he has a special interest due to the work history of his daughter, Ellie, who worked for many years for a homelessness charity and because as chair of Planning Committee he has a role in increasing the supply of affordable family accommodation.\nHere is Richard’s speech:\n“I would like to direct the attention of Council to paragraph 8.11 of the supplemental agenda which is discussing financial risks.\nIt says that the biggest driver of overspending by London boroughs is the number of people presenting as homeless and who need to be offered temporary accommodation.\nThe paper tells us Sutton had 1 084 households homeless and in temporary accommodation in October last year. It is a higher figure tonight. It is a frightening figure. Tonight we are discussing homelessness as a financial risk to the Council, but we all recognise that the fundamental reason for our concern is that behind so many of these cases are stories of tragedy, of families losing their homes and often winding up in bed and breakfast accommodation remote from their workplace and remote from the schools their children attend.\nThere is a housing crisis and we need more homes. Residents comment on the number of new flats being built in the centre of Sutton but we need this accommodation.\nThe aspiration of the Government to build more homes is right – but it has to be tempered by a concern about quality and about dealing with the consequences.\nSutton is very built up. It is not always easy to see where the new homes will come from, particularly when we are all rightly sensitive to the concerns of residents about inappropriate development and the pressures intensification can bring.\nIt is worthwhile re-stating the principles in our local plan for Sutton.\nWe need more housing, but it must be of good quality – good enough for Sutton, which means of high quality.\nWe aim to reduce development pressures on what I call the “suburban heartland” of the borough by concentrating development in the areas where development is appropriate.\nIn particular there is a zone of potential intensification close to the town centre where public transport connections are good. This may mean some tall buildings. It may mean car free or car light development as you can provide much more accommodation if you do not have to provide a parking space for every unit, and this is more acceptable in areas close to the railway station and the town centre where public transport connections are good.\nWe have a local plan, currently under review, which sets out how we meet the requirements for infrastructure to support an increase in population, which is an important concern of residents.\nI am always keen to point out that our local plan is not like the local plan you might find in, for example, North Korea, mandating what will be built. It is aspirational. It depends on developers bringing forward proposals. Its success depends a lot on the skills of our planning staff in negotiating with developers to secure what is good for Sutton, which may not be what makes most profit for the developer. I would like to pay tribute to the work of our planning staff and in particular the head, Andy Webber, who retires this month.\nIn the past year the planning system has had a bad press. The Government says we are going for growth, growth, growth. Quite right. But when asked what are the impediments to growth they invariably cite the planning system – which is represented as run by NIMBYS frustrating necessary development. That might well be the case in some places – not here in Sutton of course. But I think there is a counter argument that the planning system is a bastion against having fields and fields of sub-standard housing, as that is what makes money for developers. We destroy the planning system at our peril. But it is also right that we need a planning system that does not stand in the way of necessary change and renewal, but ensures high quality and appropriate development, to provide housing and to stimulate the economy.\nI think we have a good track record in Sutton in supporting high quality development and there are many examples in our borough of developments characterised by good design providing quality housing and infrastructure. That is what we need.”\nThe bench at the junction of The Ridgway and Mayfield Road\nThere are a number of locations in our Ward where there are benches to enable weary pedestrians to put up their feet. At the most recent meeting of the Council’s local committee we got agreement to re-new two benches in the Ward that have deteriorated over time. These are benches in Copse Hill and the one in the photograph, which is at the junction of The Ridgway and Mayfield Road.\nThere is a history to some of the benches in our Ward. In 1988 the South Sutton Neighbourhood Association celebrated the tenth anniversary of its foundation by funding a bench in Cavendish Road close to Ambleside Gardens. The bench was, after over twenty years of use and exposure to the elements, in a very sorry state. We took action to get the bench restored, with the plaque explaining the history of the bench moved to the new bench.\nOn the 27th of January Sutton Council met. Richard raised the issue of the reasons why a recent survey by The Times newspaper ranked Sutton as the eighth most attractive place to live in England. This finding does not surprise us. We spend a lot of time knocking on the doors of our residents to introduce ourselves as your local Councillors and we find people generally say they really like Sutton, mentioning a strong sense of community, open spaces, low crime, good schools, a green and pleasant environment, parks, street trees, being convenient for London and for the countryside. This is particularly the case with people who have moved to Sutton from elsewhere, particularly those from other London boroughs, from Hong Kong and from Ukraine. Please write to us and tell us what you like about Sutton or think we can improve.\nWe are always keen to look at ways of improving our Ward.\nLast year traffic engineers undertook a study of traffic flows in our Ward and the results of the exercise are listed in a later post on this site. The results have not led to some “standout” conclusion as to a problem that needs tackling but traffic officers are examining three main issues:\nwhether action can be taken to improve the safety and the experience of pedestrians crossing the Kings Lane bridge without closing the road to vehicles. The bridge is narrow. Installing a second bridge would be impossibly expensive. Marking a pedestrian path at one side of the road might be feasible. We would welcome the views of users of the bridge, both pedestrians and motorists\nsimilarly, whether something can be done to improve the safety and the experience of pedestrians passing under the railway bridge in Langley Park Road. Some proposals are to be consulted on\npossible improvements to the busy junction where Cedar Road crosses Langley Park Road. Residents have spoken to us of the difficulties pedestrians have in crossing Langley Park Road. Consultation with residents in adjacent streets is underway on proposals to install two new traffic islands in Langley Park Road. These will form a safe area in the middle of the road so the road can be crossed by pedestrians in two phases.\nYour views on these issues, and views on any other traffic and parking issues you would like us to look at would be welcomed.\nThe police met residents of Sutton South Ward again on the evening of 15 January 2025, at Devonshire Avenue school. There are open, public meetings held quarterly at which the police discuss the policing of the Ward with local residents. We were addressed by our Ward Constable, Constable Robyn Skivens, who went through the crime statistics for the Ward. Sutton has a lower crime rate than most outer London boroughs and our Ward has one of the lowest crime rates in Sutton. However, crime always has a significant impact on the victim and public concern remains high. The draft minutes of the meeting are as below.\nSUTTON SOUTH COMMUNITY / POLICE MEETING. 15 JANUARY 2025 Attended by PC Robyn Skivens and PCSO Helen Maguire for the police. A report was given on main crime trends from 1 September to the date of the meeting. DRUG OFFENCES There had been 18 drug offences, mainly possession of drugs, mainly cannabis. While this was higher than normal the increase was partly attributable to a special police operation at Sutton train station. Four of these crimes were the interception by the Border Force of drug shipments. Where such a shipment is to premises in our Ward it will count in our statistics. BURGLARY There had been 21 burglaries or attempted burglaries. This included residential burglaries, burglaries of garages and sheds, and some burglaries of businesses. It was noted that there was usually a seasonal increase in burglary at this time of year as it was darker earlier. There had been eight residential burglaries. However, some that had been reported in sheltered accommodation in the Ward were later disproved and attributed to dementia. A disturbing case was that of a landlord who was able to let himself into a flat and commit theft. Two burglaries of garages had involved theft of bicycles. Mention was made of a shop in Brighton Road where the window was smashed and the wooden panel that was then put in place to secure the premises was pulled away to facilitate burglary. Mention was made of the theft of tools from a construction site in the Ward. Some burglaries had involved the theft of keys, which were then used to commit further offences (theft of a car key leading to theft of a car). The police stressed the need to make sure keys were kept out of sight – if the keys can be seen from your letterbox you are inviting crime.\nVEHICLE CRIME\nThere had been 14 instances of vehicle crime (theft of vehicles, damage to vehicles, theft from vehicles). The police stressed the need to avoid leaving anything of value on display in your car, or in the car at all. An unusual crime had been the theft of an excavator and a dumper from the road works in Brighton Road. THEFT There had been 23 crimes in a category the police described as “theft and kindred (to theft)” events. This included shoplifting, parcel theft, theft of pedal cycles and mobile phones. Examples mentioned included theft of scrap metal, theft of a wheelie bin and theft of a wedding ring by distraction techniques. MAJOR CRIMES There had been nine major, violent crimes in the Ward. This included several robberies at the train station, a large group altercation outside a restaurant, a fight between two drug users, and a concerning incident of a woman who was followed from the station and robbed. There were also two incidents of arson, of a bin and of a Ford transit. A ULEZ camera was deliberately damaged. There was an incident where a drug user was searched and a knife, and bladed articles, were found to be in his possession. There was a disturbing incident of an anti-semitic symbol being daubed on a wall outside the synagogue in Cedar Road. There had been a succession of incidents related to a woman living in Cedar Road who had engaged in anti- social activities that had attracted a community of drug users to her premises. This was now the subject of police reports to the DPS that were expected to lead to her being charged with serious offences. SPEEDING The police had been conducting a programme of visits to local care homes and sheltered housing to talk about scams. Residents had raised with them concerns about speeding in Cavendish Road, which had led to police action in that road. There was a discussion of speeding in local roads including Chalgrove Road, Langley Park Road, The Ridgway and Cavendish Road. The police had been carrying out speed checks in Chalgrove Road and Cavendish Road. The action in Cavendish Road had led to twelve drivers receiving warnings. The police would consider further action against speeding in local roads, subject to resources.\nOTHER MATTERS DISCUSSED Staffing levels: There should be in theory be a third officer on the Ward to support Robyn and Helen, but they were coping. The number of “extractions” when they were called away to join police exercises elsewhere in London, or at the Croydon custody suite, remained an issue of concern but was now running close to 35% of their time rather than the 50% it had once been. Mention was made of local concern about a story that a body had been discovered at a house in Egmont Road. The police assured the meeting that there was no wider implication of this incident. The next meeting was tentatively scheduled for Wednesday 14 May at Devonshire Avenue school (7pm) subject to the police checking their work rota. The meeting thanked Robyn for coming back from leave to attend the meeting and thanked the officers for their work for the community in dealing with crime in the Ward. The meeting thanked Fiona Ostler for letting us meet at the school. The date of the next meeting was provisionally set as Wednesday 14 May, at Devonshire Avenue primary school and thought continues to be given to what could be done to better publicise the meeting and get a better attendance.\nConstable Skivens, Louise, Trish and Richard with other Ward police officers at the Sutton South Hello Christmas party\nThe Phoenix Concert Band – which is based in our Ward and for which Richard plays trumpet – were busy over the Christmas period raising money for the Mayor of Sutton’s charity appeal. The band practices every Friday in the church at Christchurch in Christchurch Park. A concert in the church, staged by the band in December, drew an audience of over a hundred and raised £790 for the charity appeal. The band also played Christmas carols at an event in the Straw cafe in Manor Park in December, which raised £360. On the last Saturday before Christmas the band joined a wider group of musicians to play Christmas carols in the atrium of the St Nicholas shopping centre in Sutton (see photo) which raised £180, so £1330 in all. We were grateful to the Mayor, Councillor Colin Stears, who attended all these events. In addition the band played a concert at the Friends’ Meeting House in Cedar Road on the second Saturday in December, to entertain an enthusiastic audience before the “Second Saturday Tea” which the Quakers provide every month on the second Saturday. The Mayor of Sutton’s charities are Home-Start, Sutton, and Sutton, Kingston and Epsom – Parkinson’s UK. Our contribution to the appeal was dwarfed by the £10 000 prize for second place in the boroughs’ competition won by the Sutton float in the London New Year’s Day parade.\nWe pride ourselves on the fact that we have a network of dedicated volunteers who deliver our “FOCUS” magazine throughout the Ward. If you have the odd half hour a few times a year to support us in this way please contact us. We recently prepared an end of year newsletter to update our volunteer deliverers on our activities. We thought we would share it with those who look at our website.\n“The last year has been our most successful year in Sutton South Ward. With the election of Luke as our Member of Parliament in July we have, for the first time, three Liberal Democrat Councillors representing our Ward and a Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament representing us at Westminster. We held a successful Ward meeting on 28 November where we heard from Luke on the incredibly busy life he now has as our Member of Parliament. He has been meeting all the important community groups in Sutton and Cheam, and has made speeches in Parliament on a variety of issues – ranging from the importance of support for carers to the future of Taiwan. In his maiden speech he spoke about what a pleasant place Sutton is to live, work and raise a family, a great change from the previous MP who spent all his time running Sutton down. He is enthusiastic about his role as spokesperson for London. As Ward Councillors, we have a lot of local casework that we deal with and are doing more than our fair bit as Chairs of Council committees – Trish chairing the Audit and Governance Committee, Richard the Planning Committee and Louise combining being chair of the Licensing Committee with her role as Deputy Mayor. This is her second year as Deputy Mayor following the three years during which Trish was Mayor.\nLike every local authority, Sutton Council is pre-occupied by financial issues and struggling with some difficult decisions to balance the books. The decision to close the Registrar’s office (The Russetings) in Worcester Road was one we regretted, driven by a need to consolidate services in fewer buildings, but we believe planning controls are sufficient to protect the appearance of this attractive, locally listed, building in the street scene.\nWe have secured funding for improvements to the WArd, including new information signs at the only open space in our Ward – the Devonshire Avenue Nature Area (DANA). Maintenance of the nature area involves a balance of ensuring it is a peaceful place for people to visit while preserving the biodiversity of the site. There is now a Friends of DANA group – let us know if you would like to join it. We are already looking forward to our next electoral challenge, to retain control of the Council in 2026. We need to keep up the work of talking to our residents, delivering our literature and doorknocking. Let us know if you are interested in being one of our candidates. We welcome talking or corresponding with you and with all our residents. We hope to have further Ward meetings next year. We are really grateful for the help we get.”\nSutton South Councillors were concerned to learn about changes proposed to the organisation of the Police Cadets, who meet at a school in our ward. Currently there are over 120 cadets. However, the decision has been made to close junior cadets and cut the remaining senior cadets to just 46. Their future programme is also being severely curtailed. This will have a major impact on the youth of this borough who will no longer have the opportunity to participate in activities such as camps, parades and Duke of Edinburgh awards.\nCouncillor Louise Phelan, whose son has been a Cadet, commented “I’ve seen first-hand the benefits of being part of police cadets. They learn valuable life skills, and gain self confidence. They also support the local community and get to take part in things they wouldn’t otherwise have had the opportunity to do. For many this is a stepping stone into a career within the police force, for others the Cadets help to keep them on the right path and make better life decisions. I am incredibly concerned others will now not get these opportunities.”",
  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_category_transport_page_5/content_394.html": "Richard and Heather called for action by the South Sutton, Cheam and Belmont Local Committee to support our Thameslink campaign, when initiating a debate at the committee on 11 October.\nWe drew attention to the submission we had put in on behalf of local residents (go to the category of posts called “Thameslink Campaign” to see our submission) to the recent Department of Transport consultation. Councillor Mary Burstow drew attention to her submission.\nWe know that many of our residents, with our proximity to Sutton station being a reason to live in our Ward, commute into London every day to work. Richard and Heather themselves did this for many years. Some commute to north London and the proposal to terminate Sutton’s Capital Connect trains at Blackfriars will add more than ten minutes in each direction to their daily commute, almost two hours extra down time a week. Taken with the effect of cutting us off from international services at St. Pancras, and Luton airport, and the fact that our ability to attract businesses to Sutton has been greatly enhanced by our good transport links, this proposal has to be resisted.\nThe most recent stage in what will be a battle with further, continuing stages was the combined Thameslink franchise consultation on which responses were required by mid-September.\nRichard commented, in the discussion “The reputation of civil servants at the Department of Transport, following the West Coast Main Line fiasco, is not high, and having worked there during the time that I was chair of the Channel tunnel Safety Authority, I am not altogether surprised. We will need to be vigilant in watching and contributing to the further steps in this process.\nI know that the way responses to consultation are analysed in the Department means that the volume of reaction is important. Councillor Honour and I put in our own response on behalf of our residents. Councillor Burstow did the same. ”\nRichard made some suggestions to prepare ourselves for the further stages.\n“First, I suggest that all those Councillors who put in submissions send them to the secretary so they can be included – along with his helpful note – with the papers for this meeting, so they are on the record to be used as necessary as an information quarry in further stages.\nSecond, we should consider, if it is appropriate at a later stage, passing a motion drawing attention to the difficulties this proposal causes for our residents, and send it to the Secretary of State, and seek a reply.\nThis is an important issue for our residents. On 23 August I presented a petition signed by over 5 000 residents, largely developed through Paul Burstow’s website, at the Department for Transport in Marsham Street, and the numbers wanting to sign shows how significant this is.”",

This was the annual budget meeting where we agree the Council’s budget. It is a responsible and balanced budget with the emphasis on helping the disadvantaged as we come out of the pandemic and the recession. Sutton has enjoyed safe and careful stewardship of its financial resources under the Liberal Democrat administration, in contrast to neighbouring Croydon, which has gone bust. The Conservative Councillors tabled no alternative proposal but voted against our budget. The debate was ably chaired my Trish, as Mayor. This was Richard’s speech.\n“When I spoke on the budget last year I said that ever since I studied economics at University in the 1960s I seem to have been having arguments with right wing economists and politicians who hold the view that there is virtue in:\nless Government intervention in the economy,\nreducing the size of the State\nand cutting taxes.\nSince then, the pandemic has proved how wrong these views are – and proved the need for strong and well resourced Government at national and local level.\nIn the local context this means being able to provide effective health services to care for the many thousands of Sutton residents made ill by the pandemic, and being able to provide welfare support for the almost 19 000 Sutton residents, at the last count, reduced to poverty and relying on Universal Credit. That is approaching one person in every four homes in the borough with – if the proposed £20 cut in Universal Credit happens – a major increase expected in the number of Sutton residents using Foodbanks. And if the moratorium on evictions is not extended, more homelessness.\nThe economic and welfare effects of the pandemic are significant and we need strong government at all levels to deal with these consequences.\nWhat we are celebrating tonight is a well structured and responsible budget that will give help to those who most need it – the emphasis being on supporting the most vulnerable by building on work with the health and voluntary sector, increasing funding on adult and children’s social services, and on helping local businesses and employers to mitigate the impact of the recession in Sutton – which, I see research for the Sunday Times has found is the fifth happiest place to live in England.\nI support this budget, but I would stress most of all tonight the need for Government to help our 19 000 residents living in acute poverty by scrapping the £20 cut in Universal Credit planned for the end of March. Surely we must all agree on that.”",

We will be planting new trees in the next few months in Downside Road, Upland Road, Willis Avenue and Prior Avenue.\nWe were delighted when, in accordance with the commitment to plant more trees to combat global warming, two new trees were planted in early 2021 in The Ridgway. The story concerning the tree outside number 23 is interesting. Many years ago there was a tree pit here and a tree. The tree died. Contractors tarmaced over the tree pit. The tarmac would periodically sag. Richard suggested restoring the tree pit and planting a tree. This was done. The photo was taken during the brief fall of snow on 24 January 2021.\nAt the meeting of Sutton Council on 17 January, chaired by Trish as our Mayor, Richard moved a motion drawing attention to the number of residents of the Ward living in poverty, the support they got from Sutton Council, and the need for Government to properly fund Councils, while increasing spending on welfare to help the poorest. This is the text of his speech:\n“This motion is about poverty and the impact the pandemic has had in exacerbating the gap between the wealthy and the poor in what was already a very unequal society.\nIn current political debate the phrase “Levelling Up” is sometimes used, but in a vague and unspecific manner. I have always seen “levelling up” as a key political aim, but what I mean by this is the need to level up to help those in poverty. It is a preoccupation that is one of the reasons I have always wanted to play a part in public service and political life. I am a Councillor for Sutton South Ward, one of the more affluent Wards in a borough that is more affluent than most of the 32 London boroughs. But in knocking on the doors of my residents I sometimes find people living in shocking poverty, families crowded into small flats, well down the queue for social housing despite their crowded living circumstances, using food banks, often struggling to put food on the table, sometimes out of work due to long term illness but often in these circumstances despite working long hours in low paid jobs. The statistics are frightening – in a borough with a population of about 200 000 over 18 000 of our residents are in such poverty that they are relying on Universal Credit to feed themselves and make ends meet, while over 800 of our families are homeless and living temporarily in nightly-paid accommodation, often far from Sutton with all the problems of getting their children to school here.\nWho is helping these families? Not the Government, and the low point was reached on the sixth of October of last year when, on the very day that the Government cut £20 a week from the welfare support to the poorest in society, making us one of the European countries that gives least help to the poorest in society from welfare, Boris Johnson made his famous closing speech to the Tory party conference which even one Conservative newspaper described as being like an after dinner speech full of jokey one-liners rather than a serious speech, talking in serious terms, about serious problems, given by a serious politician. We are still waiting for such a speech. I doubt if we will ever get it. And I think that even the Tories now doubt we ever get it. And in recent months it has become evident that the public at large have clearly recognised we will never get it.\nThe Resolution Foundation estimated that despite the minimum wage rise and other Government tinkering, the lowest paid fifth of households will lose £280 in support this financial year – and that was before the rise in National Insurance contributions was announced, and before the coming tidal wave of inflationary pressures became clear. This is a massive sum for those whose budgets are so stretched. Not a lot of “Levelling Up” here.\nBy contrast, what does local Government do? Despite the £36 million annual cut from our budget by central Government since 2010 Sutton Council continues to give priority to services that help the poorest, in accordance with our Liberal Democrat principles. We are one of a minority of Councils keeping Meals on Wheels going. We fund Admiral nurses to help families struggling with illness and dementia. We maintain a system of crisis loans and grants for those in greatest need, though central Government support for this was cut back years ago. We support families whose children are eligible for Free School Meals due to the financial position of the family, children who might otherwise go hungry over holiday periods. We can hold our heads high.\nWe have stuck to our principles and to these policies while maintaining our concern for financial responsibility – and despite the savings and cuts to services we have had to make over the years to balance the books as Government support has been cut. The pandemic has added a further layer of financial difficulty with demands for community support that the Council has responded to magnificently, but that have been expensive.\nWhat this motion says is:\nThe pandemic has left many families struggling to survive financially\nThe actions of Government have not helped them\nWe are the key driver locally to spearhead the recovery of the community and help those in most need\nWe need to be funded properly and the welfare support to those of our residents who are the poorest in society needs to be restored.”\nMany of our residents use Warren Park, and the footpath between the railway lines has a real rural feel about it. A small area of Warren Park is protected by a wooden picket fence, to prevent the area being trampled. This is an area of chalk grassland, an important area for biodiversity which encourages some unusual plants and butterflies. Earlier in the year the fence was extensively vandalised and the area damaged by trampling (and dog poo). There was discussion, which we were involved in, about whether the fence should be repaired, replaced by sturdier fencing that would be more effective but unsightly, or removed, with the biodiversity area abandoned. Eventually it was repaired but within a few days it had been extensively vandalised again. It has now been repaired yet again and notices put on the fencing to try to explain the importance of the area and to appeal to the vandals to leave it alone. We are not sure what the impact is likely to be but hope for the best.\nOn Friday 15 October Richard joined residents of Sutton Court and Beauclere House (in Brighton Road) on a “walkabout” of the estate to look at issues the residents wanted to raise. The party was joined by Sutton Housing Partnership (SHP) staff, including the estate manager and the Chief Executive of SHP. SHP manage the housing stock originally owned by the Council as social housing, but about half of the properties in Sutton Court have been purchased by residents under the “Right To Buy” provisions so are now rented out in the private sector rather than being social housing. The residents raised a variety of issues including surfaces that needed re-painting, guttering, garage roofs, faulty lights and notice boards that needed attention.\nSeveral residents of Copse Hill and Dunsfold Court have put to us the point that the parking bay reserved for motorcyclists outside Dunsfold Court is rarely used by motorcyclists, and that those with a motorcycle do not usually have difficulty finding somewhere off the road to park.\nConsequently we have explored the suggestion that this be restored as a parking place for other vehicles, alongside the adjacent parking places, and this change will go ahead unless there is significant local objection. Please let us know if you have views on this.\nWe are aware of pressures on parking spaces in the area, which is one of the reasons we opposed the proposal for a new tower block with relatively few parking spaces at 2 Copse Hill. This proposal, twice turned down by the Council, is again with the Planning Inspectorate in Bristol as an appeal.\nWe are also aware of a proposal for a further block of flats opposite, on the other side of Brighton Road, which was also deficient in terms of the number of parking spaces. This proposal is not yet the subject of a planning application and we are concerned about policies set out in the recent Government White Paper on planning that would, in some areas, lead to automatic consent to planning applications without a process of neighbourhood consultation. We will keep residents advised of progress.\nTransport for London (TfL) have been consulting on changes to local bus routes, including the S1, S3, S4, 80 and 407, and have now reached decisions.\nTheir original proposals and the report on the outcome of consultation can be found on the Transport for London’s website: tfl.gov.uk/sutton-croydon-bus-changes\nThe outcome means that there is little change to the situation in our Ward.\nThe main outcome is that changes to the S3 bus that might have affected our area have not been pursued, which means the S3 will still serve Cedar Road and Langley Park Road. Changes to the S4 route that affected our area are not implemented and it will still run to Overton Grange school and along Grange Road. We are pleased with this outcome, which means there will not be any detriment to services in our Ward, and points we put into the letter of representation sent by Sutton Council have been acted on.\nOn the day England qualified for the final of the European football championship, 7 July, Richard attended a meeting of Sutton Council’s Planning Committee, where we approved the proposals of Sutton United for a new stand, floodlights and a grass pitch, following their promotion to the English football league. Well done Sutton! Richard made a speech recollecting that in 2017 the club had, for the first time ever, reached the fifth round of the FA Cup, playing Arsenal at home. He was Mayor of Sutton at that time and attended the match. The facilities at the ground need upgrading, so he was delighted with these proposals for renovation. This puts Sutton on the map. Now that Barnet have dropped out of the football league, Sutton is the only one of the 32 London boroughs that people will regularly hear of, as a borough with a football league club that has the same name.\nEvery year Sutton Council holds what is referred to as its “Annual Council Meeting” where it elects the Mayor and appoints Councillors to committees. This year it was held on 4 May and held by videoconference. Trish was re-elected Mayor. Richard was relieved of membership of the Audit and Governance Committee but appointed to the Housing, Economy and Business Committee, the Planning Committee, the Greater London Employment Forum (where he is the Leader of the Liberal Democrat Delegation) and the Council and Employees Joint Committee, which he chairs. He will be busy!\nWe are going to refurbish the small piece of play equipment in the Devonshire Avenue Nature Area, which has become very tatty over the ten years since it was installed. Here is Richard’s grandson, Ciaran, enjoying playing on the installation. You can see how tatty it has become.\nThe refurbishment of the play area will see the removal and recycling of this damaged timber play equipment, comprising of over two hundred sleepers in various sizes. It will see the installation of new sleepers, wooden kickboards and “play bark safety surfacing” surrounding the play area. This will encourage children to stay active and provide an invaluable communal focal point in keeping with the natural materials of the Devonshire Avenue Nature Area.\nThe “memorial” bench that has been placed in the nature area, incorporating commemorative images remembering those who died in war, is a moving addition to the area. Here is Trish at the new bench.\nThe nature area is the only open space in our Ward and, particularly as many families live in flats with no access to a garden for children to play in, the nature area is an important amenity. The nature area has, during lockdown, like most parkland, been much more extensively visited than is normal. This has led to some erosion of its value as a nature area. We would greatly welcome the ideas of residents for improving it.\nWhile the Devonshire Avenue Nature Area is the only open space in our Ward, our residents make good use of Overton Park at the western end of the Ward and Warren Park at the eastern end. On 30 April Richard met with Council officers and other Councillors in Warren Park to discuss the vandalisation of the picket fence protecting the nature area in the park. We are anxious to preserve this chalk grassland nature site, which at certain times of year has a wonderful show of cowslips, ox-eye daisies and other wild plants, which will be lost if the area is trampled. Again, we would welcome views on how Warren Park might be improved.\nDealing with parking problems and speeding vehicles has always been a problem. The Council has now concluded, for our Ward, the long-running consultation on parking and has introduced new measures on speeding. While the Council has, on legal advice, amended or withdrawn the six month trial low traffic neighbourhood schemes funded by Transport for London, we have studied resident reaction to these trial schemes and retained the aspects that were popular.\nWe have retained the 20 miles per hour speed limit area in the east of the Ward that was originally introduced as part of these schemes. Consultation with residents showed this was popular and we are discussing action to achieve more enforcement of the limits. The speed limit area covers Mayfield Road and the roads in the Ward to the east of it. This is the area where, following lengthy consultation, a new parking control area was introduced last November. This has cleared parking from these roads which has encouraged speeding, thus justifying the new controls on speeding. The Council’s consultation exercise on parking reached a successful conclusion last year with the Sutton South Permit Parking Area now introduced. An earlier proposal was thrown out by residents but this proposal achieved majority support, generally by overwhelming majorities, in the roads consulted. We regard this as evidence of the success of the approach of the Council, with successive rounds of careful consultation. The parking permit area will be subject to a review this summer. Do contact us if there are aspects of the scheme you want reviewed.",

Grange Vale is a one-way street and the traffic passes in the direction that is away from you as you look at the bridge in these photographs.\nThere is a very narrow pavement where Grange Vale passes under the railway bridge on the Sutton to Epsom Downs line. As Grange Vale is a one-way street, cars roar round the corner from the Brighton Road end and under the bridge, the driver only seeing a pedestrian on the pavement (or in the road, the pavement being so narrow) under the bridge at the last moment. It is a particular problem for parents with buggies or small children passing under the bridge.\nA bid was submitted to Transport for London for the installation of a pedestrian-operated traffic light system, so the pedestrian can stop the traffic while passing under the bridge. Transport for London, led by Tory Mayor Boris Johnson, did not support the proposal, as not meeting their normal criteria for such a development. Your local LibDem Councillors have looked at alternative methods of improving the safety of the road for pedestrians.\nThe action taken has been to build out the pavement on the right just in front of the bridge as you look at it in these photographs, with posts at the edge of the pavement, to slow the speed of the traffic as cars have to align themselves more carefully before entering under the bridge.\nWe have campaigned for this improvement since we were elected and are pleased that we have got action.\nBecause of the dip in the road, the road can be flooded during the leaf fall season, as there are a lot of trees nearby including those next to the railway line. We have got the response team to agree to treat Grange Vale as a priority during the leaf fall season. Nevertheless, last year the road was briefly flooded due to leaf fall blocking the drains and Richard himself cleared the drains.\nMuch appreciated for the information and share!",

The full text can be found at the end of this post.\nTo put in your submission email it to teamp2@pins.gsi.gov.uk for the attention of Peter Lyne, Case Officer, quoting Planning Inspectorate reference APP/P5870/A/12/2184339/NWF.\nWe object to the proposal on the grounds that it is overdevelopment of the site, with 50 dwellings crammed in. It is the type of low-quality accommodation that we continue to oppose in our Ward, where there are instances of the Planning Inspectorate overturning local decisions and allowing substantial family houses to be demolished to make way for blocks of small flats without gardens. There are current examples in Eaton Road and Albion Road, sites where building work is currently underway, the proposals rejected by Sutton Council but allowed by the Planning Inspectorate. Half the children in our Ward live in accommodation without access to a garden. There is a shortage of affordable family homes.\nIn addition, the provision for car parking (33 car parking spaces for 50 dwellings) is inadequate and will lead to great pressure on parking, with additional demand for parking in the area.\nOur reasons are, unsurprisingly, almost identical with the reasons given by the Council for rejecting the application.\nOur submission objecting to the proposal was included in the papers that went to the Council’s Development Control Committee on 5 September, and Richard attended the Committee meeting, though he was not called to be a member of the panel of Councillors reaching a decision that evening.\nHERE IS THE FULL TEXT OF OUR SUBMISSION\nFor the attention of Peter Lyne, Case Officer\nPostal Address:\nPeter Lyne\nThe Planning Inspectorate\n3/10 Wing\nTemple Quay House\n2 The Square\nBristol.\nBS1 6PN\nAppeal relating to 54 – 58 Overton Road, Sutton, Surrey, SM2 6RB\nLondon Borough of Sutton Reference B2012/66079/FUL\nPlanning Inspectorate reference APP/P5870/A/12/2184339/NWF\nSUBMISSION\nWe understand this appeal is being determined by written procedure.\nWe would like to comment on this appeal, and ask that our comments are considered by the Inspector.\nWe are elected Councillors for Sutton South Ward in the London Borough of Sutton.\nAlthough the development is not in Sutton South Ward, it is very close to the Ward. The Ward boundary runs down Overton Road in front of the property. Our residents are among those affected by the proposal and objecting to it.\nWe object to the proposal on the grounds, first, that it is overdevelopment of the site, with 50 dwellings crammed in. It is the type of low-quality accommodation that we continue to oppose in our own Ward, where there are many instances of substantial family houses being demolished to make way for blocks of small flats without gardens. Half the children at the one primary school in our Ward live in accommodation without access to a garden. There are a lot of small flats but a shortage of affordable family homes. Couples who live in the flats in the Ward often find that when they have children, and the flat is too small, they cannot find a home they can afford in the area so have to move away.\nSecond, the provision for car parking (33 car parking spaces for 50 dwellings) is inadequate and will lead to great pressure on parking, with additional demand for parking in an area that is already fully parked up much of the time.\nOur reasons are almost identical with the reasons given by the Council for rejecting the application.\nWe note that there is to be a site visit. We would like to be advised of the date and given opportunity to attend.\nWe would like to be informed of the outcome of the appeal when it is determined.

Trish was first elected in 2014 and was re-elected in 2018 and 2022. Louise was elected in 2022. Richard served as Mayor of Sutton for 2016-17 and Trish was our Mayor for a record three yearly terms, to May 2023. Louise is our Deputy Mayor for a second successive year, through to May 2025.\nLouise, Richard and Trish at City Hall presenting the petition opposing ULEZ signed by over 10 000 Sutton residents\nCONTINUE DOWN THE PAGE TO OUR CURRENT NEWS STORIES\nOR CLICK ON THE LINKS BELOW TO GO TO OUR SPECIFIC PAGES\nThe statue “The Messenger” by David Wynne, in The Quadrant, is close to the boundary between our Ward and Sutton Central Ward\nOn 10 April there was a remarkable victory for the Liberal Democrat candidate, Richard Choi, in a by-election to elect a Councillor for Sutton Central Ward on Sutton Council. Sutton Central Ward is immediately north of our Ward, Sutton South.\nRichard got more votes than all the other six candidates added together. The result was\nLiberal Democrats 1291\nConservatives 327\nReform 282\nLabour 216\nThree other candidates (the Greens, an independent and the Christian People’s Alliance) each got less than 100 votes.\nThe Liberal Democrat share of the vote increased by 17.4%, the Conservatives fell by 10% and Labour – who finished second in this seat in 2022 – by 17.4%.\nOn 3 March the Council discussed the budget proposals for the coming year. Legally, the Council is required to set a balanced budget. With so many Councils going bust or in great financial difficulty, this was always going to be a difficult task. The problems are due to a legacy of Government cuts but also a big spike in demand for services. While people think of the Council as the body that mends the potholes, empties the bins and fixes the street lights, 70% of spending is on adult social care and children’s services (particularly for those children with special educational needs), plus the cost of finding accommodation for the homeless. There has been an increase in demand in the past year, particularly in the number of adults whose social care has to be paid for by the Council, the number of children with special educational needs and in the number of homeless families.\nRichard spoke in the debate, on homelessness – a subject in which he has a special interest due to the work history of his daughter, Ellie, who worked for many years for a homelessness charity and because as chair of Planning Committee he has a role in increasing the supply of affordable family accommodation.\nHere is Richard’s speech:\n“I would like to direct the attention of Council to paragraph 8.11 of the supplemental agenda which is discussing financial risks.\nIt says that the biggest driver of overspending by London boroughs is the number of people presenting as homeless and who need to be offered temporary accommodation.\nThe paper tells us Sutton had 1 084 households homeless and in temporary accommodation in October last year. It is a higher figure tonight. It is a frightening figure. Tonight we are discussing homelessness as a financial risk to the Council, but we all recognise that the fundamental reason for our concern is that behind so many of these cases are stories of tragedy, of families losing their homes and often winding up in bed and breakfast accommodation remote from their workplace and remote from the schools their children attend.\nThere is a housing crisis and we need more homes. Residents comment on the number of new flats being built in the centre of Sutton but we need this accommodation.\nThe aspiration of the Government to build more homes is right – but it has to be tempered by a concern about quality and about dealing with the consequences.\nSutton is very built up. It is not always easy to see where the new homes will come from, particularly when we are all rightly sensitive to the concerns of residents about inappropriate development and the pressures intensification can bring.\nIt is worthwhile re-stating the principles in our local plan for Sutton.\nWe need more housing, but it must be of good quality – good enough for Sutton, which means of high quality.\nWe aim to reduce development pressures on what I call the “suburban heartland” of the borough by concentrating development in the areas where development is appropriate.\nIn particular there is a zone of potential intensification close to the town centre where public transport connections are good. This may mean some tall buildings. It may mean car free or car light development as you can provide much more accommodation if you do not have to provide a parking space for every unit, and this is more acceptable in areas close to the railway station and the town centre where public transport connections are good.\nWe have a local plan, currently under review, which sets out how we meet the requirements for infrastructure to support an increase in population, which is an important concern of residents.\nI am always keen to point out that our local plan is not like the local plan you might find in, for example, North Korea, mandating what will be built. It is aspirational. It depends on developers bringing forward proposals. Its success depends a lot on the skills of our planning staff in negotiating with developers to secure what is good for Sutton, which may not be what makes most profit for the developer. I would like to pay tribute to the work of our planning staff and in particular the head, Andy Webber, who retires this month.\nIn the past year the planning system has had a bad press. The Government says we are going for growth, growth, growth. Quite right. But when asked what are the impediments to growth they invariably cite the planning system – which is represented as run by NIMBYS frustrating necessary development. That might well be the case in some places – not here in Sutton of course. But I think there is a counter argument that the planning system is a bastion against having fields and fields of sub-standard housing, as that is what makes money for developers. We destroy the planning system at our peril. But it is also right that we need a planning system that does not stand in the way of necessary change and renewal, but ensures high quality and appropriate development, to provide housing and to stimulate the economy.\nI think we have a good track record in Sutton in supporting high quality development and there are many examples in our borough of developments characterised by good design providing quality housing and infrastructure. That is what we need.”\nThe bench at the junction of The Ridgway and Mayfield Road\nThere are a number of locations in our Ward where there are benches to enable weary pedestrians to put up their feet. At the most recent meeting of the Council’s local committee we got agreement to re-new two benches in the Ward that have deteriorated over time. These are benches in Copse Hill and the one in the photograph, which is at the junction of The Ridgway and Mayfield Road.\nThere is a history to some of the benches in our Ward. In 1988 the South Sutton Neighbourhood Association celebrated the tenth anniversary of its foundation by funding a bench in Cavendish Road close to Ambleside Gardens. The bench was, after over twenty years of use and exposure to the elements, in a very sorry state. We took action to get the bench restored, with the plaque explaining the history of the bench moved to the new bench.\nOn the 27th of January Sutton Council met. Richard raised the issue of the reasons why a recent survey by The Times newspaper ranked Sutton as the eighth most attractive place to live in England. This finding does not surprise us. We spend a lot of time knocking on the doors of our residents to introduce ourselves as your local Councillors and we find people generally say they really like Sutton, mentioning a strong sense of community, open spaces, low crime, good schools, a green and pleasant environment, parks, street trees, being convenient for London and for the countryside. This is particularly the case with people who have moved to Sutton from elsewhere, particularly those from other London boroughs, from Hong Kong and from Ukraine. Please write to us and tell us what you like about Sutton or think we can improve.\nWe are always keen to look at ways of improving our Ward.\nLast year traffic engineers undertook a study of traffic flows in our Ward and the results of the exercise are listed in a later post on this site. The results have not led to some “standout” conclusion as to a problem that needs tackling but traffic officers are examining three main issues:\nwhether action can be taken to improve the safety and the experience of pedestrians crossing the Kings Lane bridge without closing the road to vehicles. The bridge is narrow. Installing a second bridge would be impossibly expensive. Marking a pedestrian path at one side of the road might be feasible. We would welcome the views of users of the bridge, both pedestrians and motorists\nsimilarly, whether something can be done to improve the safety and the experience of pedestrians passing under the railway bridge in Langley Park Road. Some proposals are to be consulted on\npossible improvements to the busy junction where Cedar Road crosses Langley Park Road. Residents have spoken to us of the difficulties pedestrians have in crossing Langley Park Road. Consultation with residents in adjacent streets is underway on proposals to install two new traffic islands in Langley Park Road. These will form a safe area in the middle of the road so the road can be crossed by pedestrians in two phases.\nYour views on these issues, and views on any other traffic and parking issues you would like us to look at would be welcomed.\nThe police met residents of Sutton South Ward again on the evening of 15 January 2025, at Devonshire Avenue school. There are open, public meetings held quarterly at which the police discuss the policing of the Ward with local residents. We were addressed by our Ward Constable, Constable Robyn Skivens, who went through the crime statistics for the Ward. Sutton has a lower crime rate than most outer London boroughs and our Ward has one of the lowest crime rates in Sutton. However, crime always has a significant impact on the victim and public concern remains high. The draft minutes of the meeting are as below.\nSUTTON SOUTH COMMUNITY / POLICE MEETING. 15 JANUARY 2025 Attended by PC Robyn Skivens and PCSO Helen Maguire for the police. A report was given on main crime trends from 1 September to the date of the meeting. DRUG OFFENCES There had been 18 drug offences, mainly possession of drugs, mainly cannabis. While this was higher than normal the increase was partly attributable to a special police operation at Sutton train station. Four of these crimes were the interception by the Border Force of drug shipments. Where such a shipment is to premises in our Ward it will count in our statistics. BURGLARY There had been 21 burglaries or attempted burglaries. This included residential burglaries, burglaries of garages and sheds, and some burglaries of businesses. It was noted that there was usually a seasonal increase in burglary at this time of year as it was darker earlier. There had been eight residential burglaries. However, some that had been reported in sheltered accommodation in the Ward were later disproved and attributed to dementia. A disturbing case was that of a landlord who was able to let himself into a flat and commit theft. Two burglaries of garages had involved theft of bicycles. Mention was made of a shop in Brighton Road where the window was smashed and the wooden panel that was then put in place to secure the premises was pulled away to facilitate burglary. Mention was made of the theft of tools from a construction site in the Ward. Some burglaries had involved the theft of keys, which were then used to commit further offences (theft of a car key leading to theft of a car). The police stressed the need to make sure keys were kept out of sight – if the keys can be seen from your letterbox you are inviting crime.\nVEHICLE CRIME\nThere had been 14 instances of vehicle crime (theft of vehicles, damage to vehicles, theft from vehicles). The police stressed the need to avoid leaving anything of value on display in your car, or in the car at all. An unusual crime had been the theft of an excavator and a dumper from the road works in Brighton Road. THEFT There had been 23 crimes in a category the police described as “theft and kindred (to theft)” events. This included shoplifting, parcel theft, theft of pedal cycles and mobile phones. Examples mentioned included theft of scrap metal, theft of a wheelie bin and theft of a wedding ring by distraction techniques. MAJOR CRIMES There had been nine major, violent crimes in the Ward. This included several robberies at the train station, a large group altercation outside a restaurant, a fight between two drug users, and a concerning incident of a woman who was followed from the station and robbed. There were also two incidents of arson, of a bin and of a Ford transit. A ULEZ camera was deliberately damaged. There was an incident where a drug user was searched and a knife, and bladed articles, were found to be in his possession. There was a disturbing incident of an anti-semitic symbol being daubed on a wall outside the synagogue in Cedar Road. There had been a succession of incidents related to a woman living in Cedar Road who had engaged in anti- social activities that had attracted a community of drug users to her premises. This was now the subject of police reports to the DPS that were expected to lead to her being charged with serious offences. SPEEDING The police had been conducting a programme of visits to local care homes and sheltered housing to talk about scams. Residents had raised with them concerns about speeding in Cavendish Road, which had led to police action in that road. There was a discussion of speeding in local roads including Chalgrove Road, Langley Park Road, The Ridgway and Cavendish Road. The police had been carrying out speed checks in Chalgrove Road and Cavendish Road. The action in Cavendish Road had led to twelve drivers receiving warnings. The police would consider further action against speeding in local roads, subject to resources.\nOTHER MATTERS DISCUSSED Staffing levels: There should be in theory be a third officer on the Ward to support Robyn and Helen, but they were coping. The number of “extractions” when they were called away to join police exercises elsewhere in London, or at the Croydon custody suite, remained an issue of concern but was now running close to 35% of their time rather than the 50% it had once been. Mention was made of local concern about a story that a body had been discovered at a house in Egmont Road. The police assured the meeting that there was no wider implication of this incident. The next meeting was tentatively scheduled for Wednesday 14 May at Devonshire Avenue school (7pm) subject to the police checking their work rota. The meeting thanked Robyn for coming back from leave to attend the meeting and thanked the officers for their work for the community in dealing with crime in the Ward. The meeting thanked Fiona Ostler for letting us meet at the school. The date of the next meeting was provisionally set as Wednesday 14 May, at Devonshire Avenue primary school and thought continues to be given to what could be done to better publicise the meeting and get a better attendance.\nConstable Skivens, Louise, Trish and Richard with other Ward police officers at the Sutton South Hello Christmas party\nThe Phoenix Concert Band – which is based in our Ward and for which Richard plays trumpet – were busy over the Christmas period raising money for the Mayor of Sutton’s charity appeal. The band practices every Friday in the church at Christchurch in Christchurch Park. A concert in the church, staged by the band in December, drew an audience of over a hundred and raised £790 for the charity appeal. The band also played Christmas carols at an event in the Straw cafe in Manor Park in December, which raised £360. On the last Saturday before Christmas the band joined a wider group of musicians to play Christmas carols in the atrium of the St Nicholas shopping centre in Sutton (see photo) which raised £180, so £1330 in all. We were grateful to the Mayor, Councillor Colin Stears, who attended all these events. In addition the band played a concert at the Friends’ Meeting House in Cedar Road on the second Saturday in December, to entertain an enthusiastic audience before the “Second Saturday Tea” which the Quakers provide every month on the second Saturday. The Mayor of Sutton’s charities are Home-Start, Sutton, and Sutton, Kingston and Epsom – Parkinson’s UK. Our contribution to the appeal was dwarfed by the £10 000 prize for second place in the boroughs’ competition won by the Sutton float in the London New Year’s Day parade.\nWe pride ourselves on the fact that we have a network of dedicated volunteers who deliver our “FOCUS” magazine throughout the Ward. If you have the odd half hour a few times a year to support us in this way please contact us. We recently prepared an end of year newsletter to update our volunteer deliverers on our activities. We thought we would share it with those who look at our website.\n“The last year has been our most successful year in Sutton South Ward. With the election of Luke as our Member of Parliament in July we have, for the first time, three Liberal Democrat Councillors representing our Ward and a Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament representing us at Westminster. We held a successful Ward meeting on 28 November where we heard from Luke on the incredibly busy life he now has as our Member of Parliament. He has been meeting all the important community groups in Sutton and Cheam, and has made speeches in Parliament on a variety of issues – ranging from the importance of support for carers to the future of Taiwan. In his maiden speech he spoke about what a pleasant place Sutton is to live, work and raise a family, a great change from the previous MP who spent all his time running Sutton down. He is enthusiastic about his role as spokesperson for London. As Ward Councillors, we have a lot of local casework that we deal with and are doing more than our fair bit as Chairs of Council committees – Trish chairing the Audit and Governance Committee, Richard the Planning Committee and Louise combining being chair of the Licensing Committee with her role as Deputy Mayor. This is her second year as Deputy Mayor following the three years during which Trish was Mayor.\nLike every local authority, Sutton Council is pre-occupied by financial issues and struggling with some difficult decisions to balance the books. The decision to close the Registrar’s office (The Russetings) in Worcester Road was one we regretted, driven by a need to consolidate services in fewer buildings, but we believe planning controls are sufficient to protect the appearance of this attractive, locally listed, building in the street scene.\nWe have secured funding for improvements to the WArd, including new information signs at the only open space in our Ward – the Devonshire Avenue Nature Area (DANA). Maintenance of the nature area involves a balance of ensuring it is a peaceful place for people to visit while preserving the biodiversity of the site. There is now a Friends of DANA group – let us know if you would like to join it. We are already looking forward to our next electoral challenge, to retain control of the Council in 2026. We need to keep up the work of talking to our residents, delivering our literature and doorknocking. Let us know if you are interested in being one of our candidates. We welcome talking or corresponding with you and with all our residents. We hope to have further Ward meetings next year. We are really grateful for the help we get.”\nSutton South Councillors were concerned to learn about changes proposed to the organisation of the Police Cadets, who meet at a school in our ward. Currently there are over 120 cadets. However, the decision has been made to close junior cadets and cut the remaining senior cadets to just 46. Their future programme is also being severely curtailed. This will have a major impact on the youth of this borough who will no longer have the opportunity to participate in activities such as camps, parades and Duke of Edinburgh awards.\nCouncillor Louise Phelan, whose son has been a Cadet, commented “I’ve seen first-hand the benefits of being part of police cadets. They learn valuable life skills, and gain self confidence. They also support the local community and get to take part in things they wouldn’t otherwise have had the opportunity to do. For many this is a stepping stone into a career within the police force, for others the Cadets help to keep them on the right path and make better life decisions. I am incredibly concerned others will now not get these opportunities.”",

These will be popular with young, professional people working in London as they are so close to the station. These new residents will also be spending money in local shops and restaurants\n– this increased demand is bound to lead to an upward movement in the quality of local shops and restaurants\n– there will also be improvements to the design and “street furniture” in the area associated with the Sutton Gateway project.\nThe area could change dramatically.",
  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_category_news_page_26/content_828.html": "A survey across Sutton South Ward in the period immediately before the Brighton Road car park closed and immediately after shows that the closure of the Brighton Road car park has not had an impact on parking in the Ward.\nThe results are shown below.\nNow that the decision is reached on the Subsea7 proposal to build their new offices in Sutton, Richard has written to residents setting out his thoughts on the impact locally. He claims that that he and Heather are probably the most successful local Councillors in Britain, as few have been involved in attracting 500 new jobs to their Ward. He writes:\n“When I was elected in 2010 I observed that Sutton South is a generally affluent area but there are pockets of poverty, particularly in the social housing estates in the Ward. Many of these people are people who are at the margins of the labour market, often single mothers or people in their 50s who have been made redundant, unskilled and struggling to find work, people whose lives would be transformed if they could get back into employment. Jobs are gold dust.\nI cannot pretend that the Subsea7 proposal was something I was responsible for. But when it was proposed, I felt that to have a major, successful, expanding engineering company create 500 jobs in my Ward by building a modern, attractive HQ building, replacing a half empty car park, was something positive. So, with Heather, I had a lot of discussions with Subsea7 and we would like to think that we were responsible for many of the improvements made to the plans as they developed.\nThere were three sets of objections put to me by residents.\nFirst, Subsea7 could have gone to one of the other empty office buildings in Sutton. I discussed this with them. They had a number of technical objections, in particular that the size of their work teams meant any conventional 80s or earlier tower block would not be suitable as the teams would be spread over several floors. But it became clear to me that they wanted their own, prestige building, being prepared to spend surprising amounts of money employing a top firm of European architects to design it, and if we could not accept that they would go elsewhere – Epsom or Leatherhead seemed likely. In fact Sutton has suffered a decline in the number of office buildings, as many are converted to residential uses, and it is a bonus to have this new prestige office development.\nSecond, the development would only create jobs for engineers, and not for local people. This is not so. An office complex of this size will create jobs for cleaners, receptionists, clerks, drivers, catering workers etc. The site is surrounded by social housing estates ( Sutton Court , Beauclere House, Westmoreland Drive , Ambleside Gardens ) and local people within walking distance will be well placed to compete for these less skilled jobs. The workforce in this office complex will spend money in local shops and restaurants. The clients will come to these offices from, we are told, all over the world, spending money in local hotels and restaurants. This is the type of upward momentum the area needs.\nThird, it would displace parking into local streets to an unacceptable extent. The current evidence, in the immediate aftermath of closure, is that this has not happened. Heather and I insisted on a substantial discount being offered to drivers to move to Gibson Road , and the deal done by Reed to enable their staff to park in the underused B and Q car park has been significant. For the longer term, we know Network Rail is interested in expanding the station car park. There still is a problem of parking in some roads in the Ward, though the closure of Brighton Road has not affected it.\nFrom my point of view, my term as a Councillor ends next year and I would like to think I am leaving some legacy in the location in our Ward of such a prestige development by an expanding company, creating local jobs. There are very few Councillors in the UK who have got 500 new jobs in their Ward.”\nCAR PARKING SURVEY: SEPTEMBER 2013\nThis survey of the number of parked cars was carried out on a number of dates, between 9.30am and 10.30am, this being late enough for any commuter parking in local roads to be in place.\nThe count covers all roads in Sutton South Ward outside the Controlled Parking Zone, except those with other parking controls in place such as yellow lines preventing commuter parking.\nThe dates were as follows. Results below are in the order of these dates:\n- Thursday 26 September, in the week before the car park closed\n- Monday 30 September, the day before it closed\n- Tuesday 1 October, the first day that it was closed\n- Thursday 3 October, for comparison with the previous Thursday.\nEAST OF BRIGHTON ROAD\nChalgrove Road 18 14 12 17\nDownside Road 28 22 21 24\nFarm Close 3 4 3 3\nFarm Road 3 4 4 4\nKayemoor Road 14 14 12 16\nLangley Park Road (section outside CPZ) 34 30 30 34\nMayfield Road 91 87 90 79\nPrior Avenue 18 16 16 12\nThe Ridgway north of Farm Road junction 59 59 61 53\nThe Ridgway south of Farm Road junction 9 11 12 7\nUpland Road south of Farm Road junction 7 7 4 6\nUpland Road north of Farm Road junction 18 14 16 20\nWillis Avenue 20 18 18 16\nWEST OF BRIGHTON ROAD\nAbbotsleigh Close 11 8 6 8\nAudley Close 29 26 27 29\nCamborne Road (section outside CPZ, east of Overton Road ) 38 41 35 32\nChanctonbury Gardens (outside marked bays for residents) 0 0 0 0\nGrange Road (section outside CPZ, east of Overton Road ) 30 30 30 29\nLeslie Gardens 15 11 14 15\nLyndhurst Way 2 2 2 2\nOverton Road (section south of junction with Grange Road ) 35 31 29 35\nOverton Road (section between junctions with Grange Road and Worcester Road )\n15 15 15 15\nStanley Road (section south of junction with Grange Road ) 21 22 19 21\nStanley Road (section between junctions with Grange Road and Worcester Road )\n19 17 16 19\nSummers Close 7 7 4 7\nTapestry Close (before reaching signs saying residents parking) 5 6 5 5\nTurner Mews 5 5 5 5\nVentnor Road (section outside CPZ) 9 7 7 10\nWestmoreland Drive (outside marked bays for residents) 31 26 34 34\nWorcester Road (section outside CPZ, east of Overton Road ) 20 24 24 21\nAn ugly and half empty car park, or 500 jobs",

We were very impressed by the school, which is already vastly over-subscribed. We recollect the fuss and opposition when building a school on this site was first proposed. Quite a few of our residents in Sutton South Ward now have children at this school. ~It was opened by the broadcaster Jim Al-Khalili.\nSORTING OUT THE STATION\nThe work involved in repairing a major electricity cable has caused real problems outside Sutton station and the closure of a bus stop. Trish and Richard had to intervene when the pavement was shut and no walkway established, so people were walking in the road. Eventually we got a walkway put in.\nOUR COMMITMENT TO FIGHT HATE CRIME\nHate Crime Week was 14 to 18 October. There were events in Sutton and nationally. It was an opportunity for all of us to commit again to fighting this great evil of modern life.\nIMPROVING TRANSPORT AND PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT\nWe remain committed to delivering an e-bike scheme in Sutton.\nThe Council has been partnering with Lime on a 12 months trial for a dockless e-bike scheme. Sadly this scheme has now foundered as Lime have withdrawn – we guess it did not prove profitable. The Council is in discussion with other potential providers.\nElectric bikes give you a little boost when you start to pedal and when you go uphill. This normally helps less confident cyclists.\nThe new on-demand bus service for Sutton is proving very popular. Find out more at www.gosutton.co.uk\nGRAFFITI REMOVED\nThe Council is generally quick to remove graffiti and fly tipping. When Richard reported this graffiti in Cedar Road at the foot of Northumberland House it was removed in a few days. Graffiti and fly tipping are a scourge. Report to us any instances you see.\nTHE COUNCIL’S CONSULTATION ON PARKING\nWHAT HAS HAPPENED SO FAR\nThe Council decided that, as parking is often raised as a problem in the regular surveys of the views of residents on what they like about living in Sutton, it would ask all Sutton residents if parking was a problem in their road and what they would like done. The first round of consultation led to the traffic engineers proposing a parking control scheme in just three roads in this area – Chalgrove Road, The Ridgway and Mayfield Road. As there seemed to be no appetite for the full CPZ with machines, as in Langley Park Road, what was proposed was yellow lines operable for one hour a day to remove commuters and “long stay” parkers. There would also need to be bays where people could park at any time, to cater for those residents who have insufficient drive space and need to park a car on the street all day during the day. This is the scheme in Hillcroome Road.\nThese proposals were not given sufficient support by residents for the Council to have a mandate to proceed with them. Majority opinion in Chalgrove Road was against and, with about a third of residents responding, there was a roughly equal split of opinion in The Ridgway and in Mayfield, small majorities for in Mayfield and against in The Ridgway. The Council would only want to proceed with such a scheme if there was clear and strong resident support. Paradoxically, residents in Upland Road were keen to be included in any parking scheme for The Ridgway and Mayfield.\nWHAT HAPPENS NOW\nResponses to consultation suggested that a major problem with the proposals was the free bays, which were seen as a magnet for commuters and long stay parkers, squeezing out residents. The alternative to schemes that all have this disadvantage is a residents-only Permit Parking Area.\nThe way this works is that only residents can park their vehicles in the road for a “control period”, usually one or two hours each day on weekdays, thus removing commuters and long stay parkers. However, residents would need to obtain and display a parking permit on any vehicle they want to park in the road during the “control period”, and obtain “visitors’ permits” for their visitors. As this scheme will involve the costs of administration and enforcement, and it is only fair that these are borne by those who benefit from the scheme, there is a cost for a permit. The charges would be designed just to cover costs and policy is that they will not increase in the future by more than the index of prices. The cost of a first permit in the current CPZ area is £40 which contrasts with £90 in both Kingston and Merton, £99 in Richmond, £80 in Croydon. Studies consistently show that Sutton is one of the cheapest places in London to Park.\nThe Council will consult residents on this proposal. Some residents will not see this as a price worth paying to remove non-resident parking and will not support the scheme. That is understandable – we are not making any recommendation but just want to see if residents would or would not support such a parking control scheme.\nIn Sutton South Ward, the Council will consult residents in Chalgrove Road, The Ridgway, Mayfield Road, Farm Road, Upland Road, Kayemoor Road, Farm Close, Willis Avenue and Prior Avenue, in September, on whether residents want this scheme in their road. The proposed Permit Parking Area also extends into Belmont Ward, to Egmont Road.\nFor Willis Avenue, Prior Avenue, Kayemoor Road, Downside Road and Farm Close – the results of earlier consultation did not suggest a strong push for parking controls in these road, but residents are still being asked their view on whether they would now favour your road being included in any Permit Parking Area. There was a lower rate of response from these roads, perhaps because the Stage 1 proposals for parking controls in The Ridgway and Mayfield Road were thought to have limited implications. The displacement of parking, particularly if the Permit Parking Area extends to Upland Road, and the fact that numbers of vehicles parked is continuing to gradually increase, could have an impact in the medium to long term, also noting current housing developments in central Sutton. So the Council is again taking the views of residents of these roads.\nWe are not making any recommendation – as local Councillors we simply want to do what a majority of our residents want. We hope residents will respond to the consultation, in September, so we have a full picture.\nThere is an event to explain the proposals at Sutton library on 27 June.\nNEW CROSSING IN MULGRAVE ROAD\nThe new pedestrian crossing in Mulgrave Road is a few yards outside our Ward but it will be of great benefit to our residents. Richard and Trish campaigned for this crossing. Crossing the road has never been easy at this point but the crossing will be of great importance and help.\nFURTHER RESULTS ON PARKING ISSUES IN THE WARD\nTHE ARTICLE BELOW WAS PUBLISHED IN MAY 2019 – THERE ARE FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS SO SEE THE LATER ARTICLE ABOVE. THIS ARTICLE IS KEPT ON THE SITE TO SHOW HOW THE PROPOSALS EVOLVED.\nSutton South Councillors have now seen the results of the second stage of\nthe consultation on parking. There was a strong response rate – about half of\nresidents responding in some roads, high for this type of study. The results\nare clear enough for conclusions to be drawn, but raise some issues on which\nsome more detailed information would be helpful.\nThe results for Mayfield, The Ridgway and Chalgrove indicate that residents\nare not happy with the proposals for yellow lines and bays, so might prefer a\nresidents’ permit parking area. Upland Road residents want to join in any scheme for this area, which makes it logical to also include Farm Road. There is concern about the form of the controls, the proposal being for yellow lines where parking is prohibited for a set period on weekdays, and bays where anyone can park. This could lead to competition between residents and commuters for the bays, the bays attracting “longstay” parkers and commuters touring the area looking for bays. The alternative is a Residents’ Parking Area with no yellow lines or bays, but only residents who have obtained a parking permit, or their visitors displaying a Visitors’ Permit, allowed to park in the street for this set period. This would remove commuters, increase the parking available to residents and eliminate the disadvantages described above, though there would be a charge for the permits to cover the administrative costs of the scheme. We\nwould like your views on these options.\nThere was a lower rate of response from Kayemoor Road, Prior Avenue, Willis Avenue, perhaps because the Stage1 proposals for parking controls in The Ridgway and Mayfield Road were thought to have limited implications. We think the displacement of parking, and the fact that numbers of vehicles parked is continuing to gradually increase, could have an impact in the medium to long term, particularly given current housing developments in central Sutton, So there is a case for further consulting residents of these roads, now that the parking control area will be extended to include Upland Road.\nThere will be further consultation.\nCONCERN CONTINUES OVER POLICE NUMBERS IN SUTTON SOUTH WARD AFTER MERGER WITH BROMLEY AND CROYDON\nOn 8 March we attended a meeting of the Police Consultative panel for the Ward. We continue to have no dedicated Ward office above the level of PCSO. Two police attended – our loyal PCSO Laura Jogoe and PC Adam Nawol, from Cheam Ward, also came.\nAs usual, the police SNTs are seriously undermanned. Over the 4 wards, ie Sutton South, Cheam, Belmont and Sutton West, there are 1 sergeant, 5 PCs, of whom only 3 are “operational” and 3 PCSOs. There are supposed to be 8 PCs, 2 per ward. We were told that there is a PCSO recruitment campaign. Great concern was expressed by all at the meeting and we agreed to write to MPs and the Mayor of London.The police reported that in the period December to March, there were 16 burglaries and 21 vehicle crimes in Sutton South Ward. Common methods of entry included getting over a back gate and entering from the rear of the premises by breaking a door or window. We were advised to link a burglar alarm to a call centre, rather than rely on a neighbour. Car thefts were mainly opportunist, some people forgetting to lock their cars. Drugs were not viewed as a big problem, incidents being very sporadic and tackled quickly, after which the drug sellers would move on to somewhere else.\nWHERE WE ARE ON PARKING\nTHIS ARTICLE WAS PUBLISHED IN FEBRUARY 2019. THERE ARE LATER DEVELOPMENTS COVERED IN LATER ARTICLES, ABOVE. THIS ARTICLE IS KEPT ON THE SITE TO SHOW HOW THE PROPOSALS EVOLVED.\nWe would like to again thank residents who have contributed to the two stages of consultation by the Council on parking.\nSince some misinformation has been put round in the Ward, we want to summarise where matters now stand – though all the information on the process is on the Council’s website, click on parking and follow the links to the parking strategy.\nNo decisions have been taken. We await the analysis by the traffic engineers of the results of the second consultation. As Councillors, we only want to do what residents want. We will be guided by the results of consultation and are determined not to impose our own views on this process.\nWhat we know from the first consultation is this. Much of Sutton South Ward experiences a high demand for parking as we are close to the town centre and the railway station. Parking is rationed by having a controlled parking zone (CPZ) but this leads to bumper to bumper parking six days a week in the roads just outside the zone, such as Mayfield Road. The results of the first round of consultation were consistent with previous studies by Councillors, the Council and the residents’ association, in that:\n- there is a strong majority favouring parking controls in Mayfield Road\n- there are more mixed views in Chalgrove Road and The Ridgway but, overall, support for controls\n- there are more mixed views in Upland Road and roads beyond, though less support for parking controls the further you are from the CPZ.\nThe proposals of officers was to introduce controls in Mayfield, The Ridgway and Chalgrove. It will be interesting to see whether the results of the second consultation mean that other roads, in particular Upland Road, want to join the scheme. The objective of having successive consultations was to let residents have a second opportunity to give a view when they could see what was proposed for neighbouring roads, recognising that any parking scheme will lead to some displacement.\nPrevious surveys have suggested that there is no appetite for a full CPZ with machines. The solution adopted with success elsewhere in Sutton, including in Hillcroome Road, is to have a mix of yellow lines operative for an hour a day to deter commuters, with some free to park bays. These bays are needed to cater for residents who will need to park a vehicle on the road and they also reduce the amount of displacement into neighbouring roads, which is a legitimate consideration.\nAn alternative that has been suggested is to have a “residents’ only” parking scheme with residents obtaining a permit to park during controlled hours. Disadvantages are that this scheme would involve extensive signage along the roads involved, bureaucracy, and a cost as the administrative costs of dealing with permit applications would have to be covered by charges for permits. It would also lead to more displacement. We welcome views on that alternative.\nParking has been an issue of concern locally for the 30 years Richard has lived in The Ridgway. We want to tackle this issue though recognising that it is problematic. We are consulting and will do what the majority of residents want, not impose our own solutions.",

Approaches to the bridge are at 90 degree bends and the bridge parapets are a combination of solid brick with rails on top which makes the sight lines very poor.\nThere have been 3 personal injuries at the junction between April 2008 and April 2011, and residents who use the park have reported numerous “bumps” as cars failed to negotiate the difficult twists and turns safely.\nHeather Honour, Lib Dem Councillor for Sutton South, raised this in April at the Sutton South, Cheam and Belmont Local Committee, Discussions followed with other councillors in Sutton South and the neighbouring ward, Carshalton Central, residents and with the council’s traffic engineers.\nOn July 5th Heather presented a proposal to the Local Committee drawn up by traffic engineers. Building out the footways on both sides of the junction would slow and guide vehicles on a more visible line and provide a longer footway for pedestrians. The warning signs will be upgraded and re positioned and be more prominent. The cost of implementing the complete scheme is £16,000. Other improvements, amounting to £500 will be made at the Carshalton end of the bridge.\nFunding will be allocated from the Local Implementation Plan. The work should begin in November 2012.\nCouncillor Heather Honour said,\n“ Someone said to me that the road is so dangerous we should leave it as it is. I don’t think that is good enough for our residents who risk their lives every day as they walk or drive over Kings Lane Bridge. Our traffic engineers have worked hard to find the best solution because no one wants the road closed to traffic or made one way.\nIt is great that funding can be found quickly and let’s hope that the work can be completed before we have snow and ice on the bridge”.",

This Framework includes the national statistics for immunisation and shows that the official statistics for Sutton and Merton for a large number of childhood immunisations are the lowest in the country.\nDr Ellis Friedman, the recently appointed Director of Public Health commented: “The recorded childhood immunisation rates locally appear to pose a significant risk to the health of the population. However the number of cases of infection amongst residents has been relatively low in the past few years.\n“This could reflect luck or that some immunised children are not officially recorded therefore leading to an overestimate of the risk to the health of the population. I have as a matter of urgency, reviewed the accuracy of the immunisation records in Sutton. It is clear that the information systems are poor with many immunisations known to GPs not being on the central record.\n“It therefore seems certain that the Sutton population has more protection against childhood infections than would be deduced from the low recorded immunisation rates.\n“Nonetheless the current situation is unacceptable. NHS England who became the responsible body in April need to improve the quality of the information service as a matter of urgency.”\nDr Friedman continued: “The poor quality of the information is not the only problem with the immunisation service. There are many children who are not vaccinated. The most vulnerable group is 10-16 year olds who have not had a MMR immunisation. They will receive an invitation to be immunised at their GP surgery.\n“I have spoken to primary and secondary school heads and written to every school about the importance of the MMR initiative. They have all pledged their support. They also recognise the importance of the parents of all children who have missed immunisations arranging for their child to be immunised. This can be done by contacting your GP.”\nIn the past three months there has been only one case of measles in Sutton.\nThe call for more vaccinations was repeated by Dr Brendan Hudson GP, Chair of Sutton Clinical Commissioning Group and Vice Chair of the Health and Wellbeing Board, who added: “I urge parents of unimmunised children to contact their GP to arrange for them to be vaccinated. GPs are eager to provide this important service.”",

The third round of consultation was on a proposal developed from the results of the first two consultations, for a Permit Parking Area in roads in our Ward east of Langley Park Road.\nWHAT HAPPENED IN THE EARLIER ROUNDS OF CONSULTATION\nAs parking is often raised as a problem in the regular surveys of residents on what they like about living in Sutton, the Council asked residents if parking was a problem in their road and what they would like done. Earlier rounds of consultation led to proposals that were not given sufficient support by residents for the Council to proceed with them.\nThere were concerns that unless the controls cover the whole local area parking will be displaced into roads without controls, and “free to park at any time” bays would be a magnet for commuters and long stay parkers, squeezing out residents. The alternative to schemes that have these disadvantages is a residents-only Permit Parking Area (PPA).\nTHE FINAL STAGE OF CONSULTATION\nConsequently, the Council consulted residents at the end of 2019 on a proposed PPA. As roads not within the scheme will suffer from displaced parking if the roads nearby are in the scheme, the area consulted on was wide, running from Egmont Road to Willis Avenue and Prior Avenue – including Chalgrove Road, The Ridgway, Mayfield Road, Farm Road, Farm Close, Upland Road, Kayemoor Road, Downside Road, Willis Avenue and Prior Avenue.\nThe results of the consultation are clear – in every one of the roads listed above a majority of those expressing a view on the proposals supported their introduction. In some roads – particularly Chalgrove, Mayfield, The Ridgway, Upland – this was by a large margin. In all these roads more than one in four residents responded to the study, a high response rate for such local consultation exercises, and opinion was more than two to one in support of the proposed parking controls. In other roads consulted there was a lower response rate but still majorities in favour of the proposals. Once a scheme is introduced, any individual road left out will suffer high levels of parking, so any scheme needs to cover the whole area. It is a clear result that gives the Council a mandate to proceed with the introduction of the PPA consulted on.\nThe way the PPA works is that only residents can park their vehicles in the road for a “control period”, 9 to 11 AM each day on weekdays, thus removing commuters and long stay parkers. Residents who need to park a car on the road rather than in their drive during the “control period” will need to obtain a parking permit to display on the vehicle, and many residents will want to obtain “visitors’ permits” for their visitors if the visitors need to park in the street during the control period. There are special arrangements for carers. As this scheme will involve some costs of administration and enforcement there will be a charge for a permit, to cover costs, though all residents can get an initial supply of visitors’ permits without charge. The Council can cover costs but not use parking charges to subsidise other services. Parking charges in Sutton are amongst the lowest of any London borough. Charges per vehicle are on a scale you can find on the Council website and start at £40. A similar charge in Croydon is £80, Merton and Kingston £90, Richmond £99. You only need a permit if you need to park a car in the road during the “control period.” A PPA involves notices to advise motorists of the parking controls but there is no need for yellow lines.\nResidents will receive a letter from the Council which will set out the timetable for introducing the scheme, later this year, and how to obtain permits.\nMany residents are concerned about parking and we are pleased they have now had the opportunity to put their view on a concrete proposal developed on the basis of consultation, and a clear outcome has emerged.\nSPEEDING AND POLLUTION\nWe are concerned that the removal of parking from the area will lead to clear roads that will attract more traffic and speeding. In many parts of London, though often more affluent areas, residents have campaigned to get the traffic out of otherwise quiet residential streets and onto the main roads by turning roads into cul-de-sacs, thus creating quiet roads with better air quality and no through traffic. A good example locally is the gate at the end of Dorset Road which makes Homeland Drive a quiet, traffic free road. We are interested in the proposals residents have been putting to us for consultation on such traffic initiatives in our area. Nothing is currently proposed but, as traffic continues to increase, this is the next issue we need to look at. Do let us know your views.",

Officers from Sutton Council’s Biodiversity Team were on hand to show them how to best plant the trees and teach them about how the trees will grow.\nIt is hoped the nature reserve will eventually be home to a small orchard, which will complement the existing wildlife, which includes bees, butterflies – including the scarce small blue butterfly and other insects.\nThe orchard is being rejuvenated as part of a wider project to improve the site for the local community, which we have spearheaded as Liberal Democrat Councillors for the Ward. Further plans include new benches and a self-guided nature trail.\nHeather said “It was wonderful to see the children enjoying themselves, and learning so much at the same time: how chalk developed from microscopic sea creatures millions of years ago; how to plant trees using a mixture of the original soil and compost and how to encourage wildlife. These lessons will stay with them for a long time”\nCouncillor Graham Tope, Executive Member for Community Safety, Leisure and Libraries at Sutton Council, said: “The pupils from Devonshire Primary School worked very hard to plant these trees, and I’m sure that in years to come they’ll be proud to come back and see the fruits of their labour.\n“This is a great asset for the local community, and with more features on the way to make it even more usable, I hope local residents will make the most of it this spring and catch a glimpse of some beautiful natural wildlife.”",

There were many different angles to consider and Heather addressed them in her contribution to the debate.\n“None of us can be comfortable about closing a care home for some of the most vulnerable people in our community.\nAnd one that has an excellent reputation.\nI visited Oakleigh as part of the investigation by the Health and Wellbeing Scrutiny Committee. The residents were happy and very well looked after. Care staff were totally committed to their work. I would be comfortable to see a relative of mine live there.\nI took therefore an challenging approach to the scrutiny exercise we undertook about Oakleigh.\nFrom the outset, I was shocked at the very high weekly cost to look after each resident. (one thousand and twenty four pounds) £1,024.\nThis confirmed research I’ve read from from the Dept of Health. Care homes run by councils are much more costly than those run by independent organisations. This is a nationwide phenomenon.\nIn the wider context, Sutton’s grant was dramatically cut by central government. We have to save over £30 million over the next 3 years. Savings of £10.5 million have to be found from the adult social care budget.\nSo the financial situation makes keeping an excellent, but costly, Oakleigh less possible.\nCurrent good practice says that people should be helped to stay in their own homes for as long as possible. Many would prefer to do so provided the right level and quality of support is there.\nAs part of the personalisation agenda, introduced by the last government, everyone eligible for social care has their own budget. This is based on what their needs are assessed to be. They should then be able to make their own choices about how to spend their money. All this has to happen within 18 months.\nThis means that it could be difficult for people to afford to stay at Oakleigh.\nThe key question is therefore whether there are other good quality care homes available in the borough?\nAs part of our investigation, we visited a wide range of care homes and found a wide range of quality.\nThe star rating system by the Care Quality Commission was not as helpful as we expected. ( now to be discontinued) Oakleigh was given a 3 star rating. Most care homes in the borough were given a 2 star rating. We found that some of these were excellent, some not very good.\nWe therefore recommended, that the Commissioning Unit and social workers, should work together to improve standards in those homes that had 2 stars.\nWe needed a Sutton based quality assurance, reflecting our values and standards. We could not rely on the Care Quality Commission. That organisation is in any case changing.\nWe also recommended that we should challenge the regulations that prevented us from transferring the business of Oakleigh to another, independent provider.\nOnce again Sutton demonstrated its commitment to consultation. It did challenge the Care Quality Commission successfully, and then went out for another 12 weeks consultation. Few councils would take that trouble.\nUnfortunately, no independent organisation was ready to bid for Oakleigh, probably because of the financial obligations when staff are transferred from one organisation to another.\nSo I have reluctantly concluded that there is no alternative to closing Oakleigh. I do realise what a blow this will be to those still living there, and to the hard working staff. Great efforts will be made to help people find new homes. Like my colleague I would like to say a big thank you to Link and to the dedicated staff at Oakleigh.”",

They are well supported by other senior leaders, staff and governors. Consequently, the dip in pupils’ performance which occurred after the last inspection has been successfully addressed. Pupils make good progress from their well below average starting points. By Year 6, their attainment in reading, writing and mathematics is now above average. Pupils of all abilities achieve well with an increasing number making rapid progress in response to stimulating teaching. Improvement is particularly evident in writing which has, rightly, been a focus for development. A very careful watch is kept on the progress of all pupils. Any pupils falling behind because they find learning difficult are quickly given extra help. Provision and children’s progress in the Nursery is outstanding. Exciting learning opportunities encourage children to enjoy learning. Good progress in Reception ensures children get off to a good start. Teaching is good. There are good systems to develop it further. Staff value the support provided by school leaders to help them improve their teaching. School leaders have robust systems for promoting safeguarding. Pupils say they feel safe and are kept safe. They have good attitudes to learning and most behave well both in and out of the classroom. Most parents agree that behaviour is good. Governors give good levels of challenge to school leaders. They have a very detailed knowledge of the school and share everyone’s ambitions for continuous improvement.”\nOur picture, above, is of Trish and Richard at the school in front of the artwork that the pupils prepared that now adorns the hoarding at the Subsea7 site in Brighton Road.",

The Council agreed a motion directed to the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government calling for a re-think. The motion criticised the proposed extension of permitted development rights and the envisaged interference of the Planning Inspectorate in local decisions on planning applications, affordable housing and section 106 contributions.\nHere is the full text of Richard’s Speech:\n“It is right that the London Borough of Sutton, which has been at the intellectual vanguard of so many policies in local Government, should be at the forefront in leading a campaign against the proposals of the Government to weaken planning law.\nThe motion is a balanced motion in that we are complimenting the Government on aspects of the announcement made on 6 September that we support, but we are making clear what we oppose.\nWe support proposals concerning the funding of new affordable housing, the refurbishment of empty homes, support for the FirstBuy shared equity scheme and support for housing associations.\nBut we are critical of the extension of permitted development rights, and the envisaged interference of the Planning Inspectorate in local decisions on planning applications, affordable housing and section 106 contributions.\nWhat we are saying tonight is entirely consistent with our actions and our words on planning issues.\nIt is consistent with our words in that we had an excellent debate on planning policy at the Council meeting on 17 October last year. I remember speaking in that debate and noting what we have achieved in Sutton in adopting and refining a planning policy that has secured the green, pleasant, suburban character of Sutton that we all treasure. But we noted in that debate threats and concerns that arose from national policy. We welcomed many aspects of the National Planning Policy Framework but saw four difficulties with the planning system that should be addressed – and for each of these I could cite specific examples in Sutton South Ward:\n1. that what is permitted development is already quite permissive and is leading to people building large and intrusive structures that should be brought within planning controls\n2. that the planning system is slow moving in dealing with developers who are recalcitrant and play the system\n3. the decisions of the Planning Inspectorate are sometimes inconsistent and unhelpful\n4. the Courts do not always seem to take breaches of planning law seriously.\nThese problems remain but, sadly, the Government has not taken our advice set out in the motion we passed. Indeed, it has moved in an opposite direction in what is now proposed.\nWhat is proposed seems to abandon the National Planning Policy Framework, does not address any of the problems that concerned us, and loosens further permitted development law.\nI do not believe for one second that the relaxation of requirements to seek planning permission for extensions to domestic properties is going to unleash an avalanche of building work, thus creating jobs. To the extent that this happens, it follows that this will be through the erection of buildings that would not be permitted under current arrangements. So this is a recipe for neighbourhood disputes and the erection of ugly buildings that society does not want, and that we certainly do not want in Sutton.\nI also particularly object to the way the package deals with affordable housing and section 106 contributions. Like most of you, I find that quite a lot of my casework as a Councillor involves families that are living in poor circumstances, often because they cannot find and afford accommodation that fits their needs. We desperately need more affordable housing. There are already “get out” clauses for developers who present financial analyses seemingly proving their development is unviable if they have to provide affordable housing. I am deeply suspicious of those processes and now there are to be further “get out” routes involving the Planning Inspectorate.\nWhat we say in this motion is also consistent with our actions. We have adopted stringent controls on development to ensure it meets the local needs of Sutton, particularly on the development of major sites and on back garden development. We do not want these interfered with by remote bodies in Whitehall and Bristol.\nWe have worked hard to control development in Sutton in a way that meets what local people want. And so much flows from the way the character of the area is preserved by our planning policies, making it an attractive environment for businesses and families. I never tire of telling people of the virtues of Sutton – low crime, good schools, attractive leafy streets, good transport connections, voted the best place in London to bring up children, a local economy that is surviving the recession well. All these things, to my mind, hinge crucially on having an attractive local environment and street scene.\nI hope these proposals will be re-thought.\nI strongly believe, in the words of the motion, that it is local people, through democratically elected local authorities, who are the best judges of what development is acceptable in an area.\nI commend this motion to Council.”",
  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_category_news_page_13/content_485.html": "On 20 November Sutton Council debated the subject of homelessness.\nThis is the text of Richard’s speech.\n“During my year as Mayor I was continually struck with admiration for the massive contribution to Sutton made by volunteers. Volunteers for a great range of organisations, and in particular volunteers for organisations like Nightwatch, like the Street Pastors, like Sutton Community Works, and like the food banks, all of whom are dedicated to helping the poorest and most dispossessed in our society.\nBut I could never escape from a feeling that in a rational and caring society organisations like the food banks and those providing in effect soup kitchens and advice for rough sleepers and those with no resources, like Nightwatch, would not exist. They would have no clients. How is it that in an affluent society like Britain we are such an unequal society that we have people in such poverty that they need food banks to feed themselves and they lose the roof over their heads, reduced at worst to rough sleeping, at best to the local authority finding them emergency bed and breakfast accommodation probably some miles from Sutton.\nThis would be an entirely academic observation were it not for the fact that this problem is not diminishing, it is increasing. Not just in Sutton, but nationally.\nThe statistics for Sutton show that in April of 2015 the number of homeless households the Council had placed in temporary accommodation stood at 280, a year later it was 411, last week it stood at 581. But it is not a Sutton problem, it is a national problem. It is everywhere.\nAs a Councillor I have found increasing casework concerning families given notice to quit and that the Council then has to place in emergency accommodation often miles from their roots, miles from the schools their children attend, miles from their employment in Sutton. In one recent case I dealt with this eviction appeared to be largely because the family had complained to the landlord about the all pervading damp in the flat.\nWhat can be done to turn the tide ? What local authorities and volunteers like Nightwatch can do is no more than picking up the pieces. The Council has the difficult task of finding accommodation. When I was Chair of Planning Committee three years ago one of the decisions we took, controversial at the time and I recollect it was not without opposition, was to convert the Oakleigh home to be a hostel for families in need of emergency accommodation. But we would need many more Oakleighs now just to meet the increase in that need since that time.\nThe failure here, leading to the problem escalating, is a failure of policy. It is the welfare and housing policies of central Government that are failing to address the problem and leading to its escalation.\nI could spend a long time detailing these failures – the bearing down on those already in poverty through the benefits freeze and through changes to support of those unable to work due to disability and illness, the introduction of Universal Credit in a way that is most concerned to save money, the loss of the Council’s stock of social housing due to the right to buy, the decline nationally in the construction of new Council houses and affordable homes, which we are trying to address here in Sutton with our ambitious programme to build the first new Council homes in 30 years. Changes to the Local Housing Allowance. The loopholes in planning law that enable developers such as those who refurbished Northumberland House in my Ward to evade requirements to provide any affordable homes atall. The list goes on. It is part of a war on what my generation cherished as the welfare state.\nMy colleague Councillor Fivey, who sadly cannot be here tonight, has had discussions with Nightwatch since the organisation was formed and assisted in their obtaining £586.13 from the Council through the Neighbourhood Grant programme to pay for the tent, a gazebo, from which they operate three nights a week in our Ward, providing food and help to rough sleepers and others without resources. Current discussions about the best practical further help for Nightwatch, and other organisations, will continue.\nWe all support the work of Nightwatch but there is no logic in expressing our support for organisations like Nightwatch while not mentioning what should be done to stop these problems occurring in the first place, which is to change Government policy.”",

In each case a car had collided with the tree and this had led to the tree being lost. One could see the ugly patch of brown earth left in the grass verge, where the tree had once been. Further investigation revealed that there had been a similar incident in Effingham Close leading to the loss of a tree.\nCouncillor Clifton persuaded Sutton’s chief arborculturalist, Ben Morris, to visit Copse Hill with him. It has taken a little while but in January new trees were planted to replace those lost in Copse Hill, in the exact same places as the trees that were lost, while two new trees have been planted outside 18 and 34 Efingham Close.\nCouncillor Clifton has appealed to residents of the roads to ensure the young trees are watered in dry weather.\nWhile assisting residents in Copse Hill, our attention was drawn to the potential problem of the flooding of the road in periods of very heavy rain, as the water flows down Effingham Close to the bottom of the hill. After discussion with engineers in the Highways Department, action was taken to install a new drain gully at the foot of the hill. We hope this has resolved the problem of the flow of water down the hill. There remains a more minor problem with the puddles outside numbers 2 to 10 Copse Hill. Gerry McLaughlin of the Highways Department is shown here marking out changes to the gulleys. There will be a programme of cleaning out the soakaways over the summer and it is hoped that this problem is resolved.\nCouncillor Clifton visits Copse Hill for a discussion with Gerry McLaughlin.",

While we were pleased the Olympics were now over and demands on police resources would return to normal, we felt the police had done a superb job during the Olympics.\nOn Thursday 13 September we both went to Sutton Court to the estate “walkabout” with staff of Sutton Housing Partnership (SHP).

This may include re-opening tenders for St Helier and Sutton hospitals.”\nMatthew Hopkins, Trust Chief Executive said: “This is disappointing news, but St George’s have been clear to us that their decision is not based on our staff, nor the quality of the services we provide at St Helier and Sutton hospitals.\n“As you would expect, the Trust Board and those working on the transaction have been looking at other options in case this happened and we look forward to discussing these with the Transaction Board next week.\n“Whilst we are making decisions about the long-term future of our hospitals, our priority will – as ever – continue to be ensuring our patients and local people receive the very best services.”\nAsked what this means for Epsom Hospital, Jan added: “It is the current belief that, subject to Ashford and St Peter’s Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust being confirmed as the Preferred Partner for Epsom Hospital, the de-merger could continue whilst we make alternative arrangements for St Helier and Sutton.\n“Whilst this would, of course, need further investigation and approval by the Transaction Board, the Trust Board and others, it is felt that this would be in the best interest of Epsom Hospital, its patients, staff and local people.\n“However, I would emphasise that the priority remains to secure the future of Epsom, St Helier and Sutton hospitals.”\nFor more information about the work of the Trust visit our website: www.epsom-sthelier.nhs.uk. You can also follow us on Twitter (twitter.com/epsom_sthelier) or find us on Facebook (facebook.com/epsomsthelier).\nThis is what St Georges said in their press release:\nSt George’s media statement\nSt George’s Healthcare NHS Trust submitted a bid for a potential merger with St Helier Hospital in November 2011.\nThe board is clear that a merger between St George’s Healthcare and St Helier would be an excellent strategic opportunity, with the potential to bring significant improvements to the care of patients across southwest London and beyond.\nAfter careful consideration the board has reached the conclusion that the current terms of the merger prevent us from proceeding further at this time.\nThe level of financial challenge facing hospitals in south west London, combined with the inability to pre-empt the outcome of a public consultation around the Better Services Better Value (BSBV) review, means this is not the right time for us to progress with the transaction.\nWe want to continue to build on the existing links that are in place for clinical services. We have identified a number of the potential benefits to patients that would occur from an acquisition which could also be delivered if the organisations remained separate legal entities which we shall continue to pursue.\nWe are particularly keen to develop the clinical and academic networks that span St George’s Healthcare and St Helier, and explore opportunities to establish new networks across services, to the benefit of patients.\nA key priority for the trust is to achieve Foundation Trust (FT) status by 2014, and we will focus our efforts on achieving this. The board feels strongly that achieving FT status will strengthen the opportunities for St. George’s Healthcare and St Helier to work together in the future.\nThis is what Ashford and St Peters have had to say:\nStatement re Epsom Hospital\nChief Executive at Ashford and St Peter’s Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Andrew Liles, said:\n“The decision made by St George’s Healthcare NHS Trust not to pursue their bid for St Helier and Sutton hospitals has not changed our position regarding Epsom and we will continue to progress our plans to acquire Epsom hospital (through merger) in line with the process set out by the Transaction Board. Of course this is still subject to approval by the Transaction Board, Epsom and St Helier, the local health authorities and others and by our own Board, who will need to be assured that any final decision is in the best interests of both the Epsom and Ashford and St Peter’s catchment populations.\nAs a Foundation Trust already we feel we are in a strong position strategically to pursue these plans and we know they have already passed through the first stage of the process successfully, meeting the criteria set by local people, stakeholders and staff. These include new and innovative partnerships – with The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, Central Surrey Health and Surrey and Sussex Partnership NHS Trust – to create an integrated healthcare campus at Epsom Hospital, bringing additional services and added benefits to local patients and staff. Our plans are also made more straightforward by the fact that Epsom hospital is not part of the Better Services Better Value review in South West London.\nWe have also had positive initial discussions regarding financial and commissioning support for our plans, although of course final decisions regarding the preferred provider and agreement of financial support are still to be made.”\nFor more information please call the Press Office on: 01932 722163",

  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_2023_10_01_not-good-enough-for-sutton/content_34.html": "The owner of Chelsea Court, 54 Mulgrave Road has had planning permission to extend the building – in effect adding two extra floors to the block of flats – refused by Sutton Council. This was the latest in a series of applications in our Ward where owners of blocks of flats have sought to extend the building upwards.\nAs local Councillors, we were concerned about these proposals. While there is a need for more accommodation, the changes to the building would in our view make it look incongruous, not good enough for Sutton. The block is an attractive architect-designed building (see photo), one of the more attractive blocks in Mulgrave Road, and the proposed changes would destroy the symmetry of the building. The Planning Department at Sutton Council agreed with our objections. The changes would also have involved building work that would greatly disturb the current residents of the block.\nThe owners used a mechanism called “prior approval” when submitting their planning application. This mechanism, in our view, was introduced by the Government to undermine the planning system. As a result, we could take the application to the Council’s Planning Committee, which Richard chairs, for decision by Councillors. We may still not be able to stop these changes taking place given the powers of the remote Planning Inspectorate based in Bristol to over-ride local decisions.\nWe always seek to ensure in such cases that a number of conditions are stipulated in any planning permission, if one is ever granted, to try to protect the peace and quiet of the building during construction work. These include that access to the roof should be via an external hoist with all materials for work on the roof transported to the roof by an external hoist and not brought up via the well of the building. The interior of the building should not be a storage area or building site. There should be a construction management plan to minimize disruption to existing residents and ensure there are controls on dust and noise, and on hours of work. The contractors should join the Considerate Contractors’ Scheme. There should be a liaison officer that residents can contact if they observe poor behaviour. If scaffolding is erected outside residents’ windows it should only be erected when needed and removed as soon as it is not needed.\nWe have successfully opposed this development but wait to see if the developer will appeal to the Planning Inspectorate against the decision of the Council.",

This is just outside our Ward. B and Q plan to close the store next June. Richard commented that, though he is no do-it-yourself fanatic, he regretted the closure of the store, but B and Q say it no longer makes them money and they have decided to close.\nIt is inevitable that the site will be developed as housing. There is no demand for new office space (more people work at home) or new shops (more people shop using the internet) but there is a housing crisis. On the day of the discussion 970 Sutton families were homeless and living in bed and breakfast accommodation, at the expense of the Council and thus our Council tax payers. More homes are desperately needed. The philosophy in the Sutton local plan is to meet our housing targets partly through a more intensive area of development close to the town centre and near the railway station. As public transport links are good in this area it is possible to envisage a car free or “car light” development – if you have to provide a parking space for every house many fewer homes can be built. This reduces development pressure on the borough’s suburban heartland and Green Belt areas. Planning Committee often considers proposals to build on the Green Belt which we resist, but the new homes must go somewhere. The more intensive development in the town centre will inevitably include some tall buildings, and there is a cluster close to the railway station.\nEvidence was presented to the committee on action taken to deal with some of the consequences of this development, such as a need for places in local schools, demands on health services and additional strain on water and sewage systems. Richard commented that there were attractive features to the proposed development, 60% of which would be open space, including an area of public parkland, a water feature, an amphitheatre and terraced roof gardens. The most important aspect, though, was the plan for 337 “affordable” homes where Sutton Council can place the most deserving of the 2 600 families on the housing register. This will include families that are homeless or those we meet, in our Ward, who are living in dreadful housing circumstances – sometimes families with three or four children living together in tiny flats.\nThe planning application was approved. Initially all that local people will observe is the closure of the store, hoardings put up round the site and the store demolished. Then there will be building work but it will be several years before anyone moves in. Eventually, it will be an attractive, landscaped site. On the website\nthere is a video of a walk through a CGI representation of what the final product will look like.",

She found the service a moving experience.\nRichard attended the Remembrance Day service in Redhill as the band he plays trumpet with, the New London Concert Band, was playing the music and they were short of trumpets. With so many services on Remembrance Day almost every amateur band in south London is pressed into service somewhere and trumpet players are in demand. The music they played included Elgar’s Nimrod and a piece composed in 1919 by Kenneth Alford to commemerate those who died in the war, “The Vanished Army”.",

The reason why demolition is now taking place is that the Planning Inspectorate, based in Bristol, over-ruled your local Council when an appeal was made.\nRichard spoke against the application when it came to the Council’s Development Control Committee, and helped persuade the Committee to throw the application out. But we cannot overturn a decision by the Planning Inspectorate, whose decisions have been – in our view – inconsistent and unhelpful to planning policies in our area.\nWe remain concerned that the continuing demolition of family houses and their replacement by small blocks of small flats without gardens is leading to an unbalanced housing stock in the area, and we will continue to oppose this trend in dealing with planning applications.

Hooray.\nA further meeting of the project board guiding the Sutton Gateway project, a board on which Richard represents Sutton South Ward, heard on 25 September that good progress is being made with the scheme.\nThe most important news is that the building work on the side entrance is completed enabling the passageway from The Quadrant to be restored and the side entrance to be opened for passenger use. The side entrance is open from 7am to 7pm.The cycle racks next to the newly opened side entrance have been improved.\nWork at the front of the station commenced in September and will be completed by March 2015, but with no work over the Christmas period to avoid any inconvenience to shoppers. Some of the work will involve traffic diversions.\nThe project’s proposals to further develop the area around Sutton station include:\n– refitted shop fronts, new paving and newly planted trees to improve the look of the area\n– more lighting and CCTV cameras to make the area safer\n– extra cycling facilities, with new bike racks and shelters\n– a town centre clock\n– a new crossing in Brighton Road\n– the opening of the side entrance to Sutton station\n– new “legible London” signs\n– a re-arrangement of the bus stops to reduce congestion\n– an additional crossing for pedestrians outside the station\n– re-design of the Cedar Road / Brighton Road junction to improve visibility for motorists\n– it is not proposed to move the taxi rank, except that after 6.30 some taxis will be able to park immediately opposite the station, with the bus stop opposite the station moved further down Brighton Road and with some buses stopping in Mulgrave Road\n– there will be “live” bus information in Sutton station, subject to further research by Network Rail\n– the timing of the pedestrian crossing at the High Street / Grove Road / Sutton Court Road junction will be amended to give more time to cross\n– the number of parking spaces in the station area will be increased\n– general improvements in design and to the “public realm” around the station, with more flowers, more colour and better signage.\nThe changes, including the changes to the bus stops, will be completed by March 2015.\nThese changes are largely funded by grants the Council has obtained, not local Council tax payers.\nThe results of the earlier consultation exercise on the Gateway Project indicated general support for the scheme, but we were able to make a number of changes to respond to specific issues raised. In our Ward, a particular concern for the businesses was the need for a loading bay on Regents Parade just south of the station. We successfully lobbied for this to be incorporated into the scheme.\nOn 27 February Richard and former Ward Councillor Heather Honour organised a breakfast meeting with local businesses in our Ward to take their views on the Sutton Gateway project. Several joined us in the Rose Café in the Brighton Road, which serves excellent scrambled eggs (Richard’s breakfast). This is right in the area that is to be developed so we were able to chat and walk round the area to see the proposed changes.\nPublic consultation on the emerging proposals ran till 5 March. Consultation was by leaflets in the locality, questionnaires to members of the public, posters, newspaper advertisements, exhibitions, further “stakeholder” meetings and putting information in Sutton station.\nResidents and businesses close to the station were consulted, together with the emergency services and other groups with a major interest such as Network Rail, Southern Rail and TfL.\nAlso of great value will be the “legible London” signs at the station entrance. See the designs at\nhttp://www.tfl.gov.uk/microsites/legible-london/3.aspx\nRichard says “As a local man who for twenty years of my life commuted to central London by a route that meant I walked every working day along Wellesley Road and past the shuttered and barricaded side entrance, to enter the station from the front, it has long been an objective of mine to get the side entrance open. Every second counts when you are a commuter.”",
  "https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_suttonsouth_mycouncillor_org_uk_2017_11_20_richard-speaks-out-on-homelessness/content_537.html": "On 20 November Sutton Council debated the subject of homelessness.\nThis is the text of Richard’s speech.\n“During my year as Mayor I was continually struck with admiration for the massive contribution to Sutton made by volunteers. Volunteers for a great range of organisations, and in particular volunteers for organisations like Nightwatch, like the Street Pastors, like Sutton Community Works, and like the food banks, all of whom are dedicated to helping the poorest and most dispossessed in our society.\nBut I could never escape from a feeling that in a rational and caring society organisations like the food banks and those providing in effect soup kitchens and advice for rough sleepers and those with no resources, like Nightwatch, would not exist. They would have no clients. How is it that in an affluent society like Britain we are such an unequal society that we have people in such poverty that they need food banks to feed themselves and they lose the roof over their heads, reduced at worst to rough sleeping, at best to the local authority finding them emergency bed and breakfast accommodation probably some miles from Sutton.\nThis would be an entirely academic observation were it not for the fact that this problem is not diminishing, it is increasing. Not just in Sutton, but nationally.\nThe statistics for Sutton show that in April of 2015 the number of homeless households the Council had placed in temporary accommodation stood at 280, a year later it was 411, last week it stood at 581. But it is not a Sutton problem, it is a national problem. It is everywhere.\nAs a Councillor I have found increasing casework concerning families given notice to quit and that the Council then has to place in emergency accommodation often miles from their roots, miles from the schools their children attend, miles from their employment in Sutton. In one recent case I dealt with this eviction appeared to be largely because the family had complained to the landlord about the all pervading damp in the flat.\nWhat can be done to turn the tide ? What local authorities and volunteers like Nightwatch can do is no more than picking up the pieces. The Council has the difficult task of finding accommodation. When I was Chair of Planning Committee three years ago one of the decisions we took, controversial at the time and I recollect it was not without opposition, was to convert the Oakleigh home to be a hostel for families in need of emergency accommodation. But we would need many more Oakleighs now just to meet the increase in that need since that time.\nThe failure here, leading to the problem escalating, is a failure of policy. It is the welfare and housing policies of central Government that are failing to address the problem and leading to its escalation.\nI could spend a long time detailing these failures – the bearing down on those already in poverty through the benefits freeze and through changes to support of those unable to work due to disability and illness, the introduction of Universal Credit in a way that is most concerned to save money, the loss of the Council’s stock of social housing due to the right to buy, the decline nationally in the construction of new Council houses and affordable homes, which we are trying to address here in Sutton with our ambitious programme to build the first new Council homes in 30 years. Changes to the Local Housing Allowance. The loopholes in planning law that enable developers such as those who refurbished Northumberland House in my Ward to evade requirements to provide any affordable homes atall. The list goes on. It is part of a war on what my generation cherished as the welfare state.\nMy colleague Councillor Fivey, who sadly cannot be here tonight, has had discussions with Nightwatch since the organisation was formed and assisted in their obtaining £586.13 from the Council through the Neighbourhood Grant programme to pay for the tent, a gazebo, from which they operate three nights a week in our Ward, providing food and help to rough sleepers and others without resources. Current discussions about the best practical further help for Nightwatch, and other organisations, will continue.\nWe all support the work of Nightwatch but there is no logic in expressing our support for organisations like Nightwatch while not mentioning what should be done to stop these problems occurring in the first place, which is to change Government policy.”",

The main elements, subject to consultation, include:\n– opening the side entrance to the station\n– re-development of the Cedar Road / Brighton Road junction to include a “countdown” crossing to tell pedestrians how long they have to cross\n– further development of the facilities for cyclists\n– re-design of the steep steps up to the side entrance so they are at an acceptable angle\n– better landscaping, street furniture and paving around this area, the station entrance area and the area around Sutherland House. The redundant cycle path outside Sutherland House will be removed to make more room for landscaping.\nThe station manager has confirmed that the side entrance would be manned from 7am to 7pm and at other times open but monitored on screens at the front entrance.\nSince they were elected Richard and Heather have campaigned for the opening of the side entrance to Sutton station.

The top rating has only been achieved by Councils with specific targets in place to reduce loneliness and isolation within their local communities.\nResearch from the Campaign to End Loneliness revealed that up to 800,000 people in England are chronically lonely. According to evidence from the Campaign to End Loneliness, social isolation has the same negative impact upon health as ‘smoking 15 cigarettes a day’, and is ‘worse than obesity’ due to an increased risk of blood clots, heart disease and dementia. In addition, lonely people are likely to drink more alcohol and are also more prone to early admission into residential or nursing care.\nAs local Councillors who saw this as a specific issue in our Ward, given the more elderly population and number of people living alone, we are delighted by this national recognition. We’re committed to continuing our work in Sutton to prevent social isolation amongst our residents and combat loneliness. In Sutton our Health and Wellbeing strategy describes our priorities for taking action to improve the health and happiness of our residents and ensure that people are not isolated and instead feel included within their local communities.\nThe nine other councils awarded gold status are:\n· Bath and North East Somerset\n· Blackburn with Darwen\n· Manchester\n· North Lincolnshire\n· North Yorkshire\n· Sheffield\n· Thurrock\n· York",

The many care homes and blocks of sheltered accommodation in the Ward partly explain why we have a more elderly population, but there are also many elderly people living in their own homes. We want to enable people to live in their homes for as long as they can, which is why Sutton Council is one of the only London Councils to fund Admiral nurses. These are specialist nurses trained assisting those with dementia, working closely with families and carers to help people to live at home. We are proud to be members of a Council that provides such help, despite the severe financial squeeze the Council is facing, as an expression of our Liberal Democrat values.\nA STRATEGY FOR PARKING\nParking in our Ward has increased in recent years partly due to more people working in Sutton or commuting to town as the economy has recovered, and not being prepared to pay to park in the town centre car parks, although their prices are amongst the cheapest in London and they are never full.\nResponding to residents’ concerns, the Council’s Environment and Neighbourhoods Committee has agreed a parking strategy for the Borough involving an area by area consideration of parking controls. To make this manageable the study will be scheduled over several years, dealing with the town centre in the first year. Any changes to the town centre controlled parking zone and car parks will have an impact on the roads in our Ward so the plan starts from the centre and moves outwards. Our area will be considered the following year.\nPeople have a mix of views on parking controls in their road. As they can displace parking into nearby roads, it is not intended to introduce further parking controls in the roads in our Ward prior the study next year. But we would welcome the views of residents in preparation for this study.\nAN AWARD FOR SUTTON POLICE CADETS\nPIONEERING EXHIBITION STAGED BY SUTTON SOUTH HELLO\nOn 7 March Ricard, as Mayor, opened a remarkable exhibition put together by Heather Honour and her Sutton South Hello team. This featured the reminiscences of elderly members of the group, based on a number of themes, such as their experience of evacuation of children during the 1939-45 war. Richard had attended some of these reminiscence sessions and found them fascinating.\nSutton South Hello goes from strength to strength.\nNEW SUBSEA7 OFFICES OPENED BY SUTTON’S MAYOR AT RIBBON CUTTING CEREMONY\nGOLD DUST FOR THE LOCAL ECONOMY: SUBSEA7 MOVE IN TO THEIR NEW HQ\nOccupation of these two buildings, increasing footfall in the area and business for local shops, restaurants and hotels, will have a positive effect on the local economy. And the Subsea7 project will keep many hundreds of jobs to our area that would otherwise have been in Epsom or Leatherhead, and add several hundred new jobs. Jobs are gold dust for the local economy.\nCRIME REMAINS LOW IN SUTTON SOUTH\nTrish and Richard attended the Ward police consultative committee meeting on 10 January. The police again reported that crime in our area remains low.\nIn the final quarter of 2016 there were 3 residential burglaries in our Ward (down from 6 in the corresponding period a year previously), 3 non-residential burglaries (down from 7), 7 thefts from motor vehicles (down from 12) and 2 thefts of motor bikes.\nThe police had executed a number of drug searches in the last quarter, which they felt had had a positive impact. Priorities continue to include drugs, looking out for rough sleepers in stairwells of blocks of flats, anti-social behaviour at bus stops, speeding checks and aggressive begging around Sutton station.\nThe police consultative panel next meets at Christchurch hall in Christchurch Park on 9 May. This is a public meeting. See if you can come.\nThere were several “Speedwatch” events in the last quarter, some involving students from Overton Grange school, using a speed gun to catch and warn speeding motorists.\nSUTHERLAND HOUSE – NOW NORTHUMBERLAND HOUSE: RESIDENTS MOVE IN\nResidents have started to move in to the the block in the Brighton Road just south of Sutton station that we all knew as Sutherland House but which now has a new name – Northumberland House. Perhaps the owners changed the name as – after it being empty for five years – they want to signal a new beginning for this building. They have spent money on the renovation and certainly improved the way it looks, as the pictures above show.\nThe apartments in the block, a few hundred yards south of Sutton station and in our Ward, are available to rent. The Acorn Group are in charge of renting out the flats. If anyone is interested in renting they can contact Kimberley Ellen (kimberley.ellen@acorn.ltd.uk or ring her 020 8315 6917). The flats are also advertised on the website Rightmove.\nOn 14 January Richard visited the block. It has been refurbished to a high standard and it is good to see it occupied. There are 128 flats with parking spaces.\nAs long ago as December 2015 we met with Council officers and the developer to discuss renovation of the front, to fit in with the Gateway scheme further north. We have sought agreement that the owners fund the renovation of the area in front of the building, to bring it up to the same standard as the area renovated during the “Gateway” project just to the north. The shops at the bottom are not fully let out and we have hopes that the area just south of the station will include of a mix of good restaurants, shops and maybe a wine bar as the area will have so much more footfall. We are pleased that the Rose cafe and Sofra are surviving. We look forward to the area in front of the building being renewed and improved in due course and the vacant shops let out. However Sainsburys have pulled out of opening a store at the bottom.\nThe area has in the past suffered from a group of “all day drinkers” who walk the streets drinking alcohol from cans. However, one of Richard’s first acts when elected in 2010 was to get the “no drinking” zone extended from Sutton town centre into Sutton South Ward. This makes it unlawful to drink alcohol in public in the area if a police officer asks you to stop.\nSTUNNING SUCCESS FOR SUTTON IN 2017 LONDON NEW YEAR’S DAY PARADE\nThe float entered by the London Borough of Sutton won fourth prize in the 2017 London New Year’s Day Parade, our best result in over a decade and a stunning achievement given the stiff competition from other London Boroughs.",

Sutton is ranked the highest outer London Borough in having the lowest CO2 emissions.\nWe represent Sutton South Ward, which has only one open space, the Devonshire Avenue Nature Area, an oasis of open space in an area dominated by small blocks of flats, where a study showed half the children live in properties without a garden. We think it commendable that Sutton Council has ensured that this site remains a nature reserve. But a few years ago that meant leaving it as jungle. It was little used, except for anti-social happenings behind the brick walls that still occupied part of the site. Today it remains a nature area, aiding the survival of the rare small blue butterfly (a talisman of Sutton South Ward), but it has benches, paths and a nature trail. We wanted to take the opportunity the motion afforded to pay tribute to Sutton Nature Conservation Volunteers, who maintain the site, and to those who distribute the funds to aid community projects provided by the landfill operator Viridor, whose funding, in 2012, paid for the renovation of the site."
