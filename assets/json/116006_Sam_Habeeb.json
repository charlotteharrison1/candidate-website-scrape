Famous for the great experience he brought on stage through his flamboyant style and just unbelievable four-octave singing, his work as Queen’s lead vocalist made him a super attractive figure in the eyes of fans worldwide. With his ability to be able to connect with fans and deliver electrifying performances in the front, one finds Mercury being the most iconic figure ever in the history of music. This prolific songwriter, behind the theatrical front, was the maker of such classic hits as “Bohemian Rhapsody,” “We Are the Champions,” and “Somebody to Love.”\nDid Freddie Mercury live in India?\nMercury’s background in Zanzibar and India proved to set the ground for what he would become later as a renowned artist. He was forced to leave with his family in 1964 when the Zanzibar Revolution occurred. Upon reaching England, he finally started dreaming about his career as an artist. He formed Queen in 1970 with Brian May and Roger Taylor, thus leaving him with a very different niche in the rock world of music. He kept coming up with such unique work from the date he was first diagnosed with AIDS in 1987 up to the last day he met the disease by falling on early November 24, 1991. After leaving him, a stoppage was never seen by honors along with a concert tour around the world as part of paying him tributes by celebrating his great life.\nFreddie Mercury A Songwriting Genius\nHe is a prolific songwriter since he came up with 10 of the 17 songs in the album Queen Greatest Hits, one of which features the anthems “Bohemian Rhapsody,” “We Are the Champions,” and “Don’t Stop Me Now.” Among these genres included were rockabilly and disco to gospel, including heavy metal—and this only due to not being repetitive yet keeping the creativity out. Known for intricate works with layers such as “Bohemian Rhapsody” and hits like “Crazy Little Thing Called Love,” Mercury hardly knew how to read a note and always composed complex harmonies in his songs. Working primarily in piano, Mercury’s music style was indeed groundbreaking, considering his posthumous admission to the Songwriters Hall of Fame and many achievements.\nWhat was Freddie Mercury known for?\nIn addition to his work with Queen, Freddie Mercury also pursued solo projects that highlighted his diversity. While not as commercially successful as the albums by Queen, his solo work did manage to make some chart-topping success in the UK. Some of his notable works are listed below:\nEarly Career:\n- 1973: He released “I Can Hear Music” and “Goin’ Back” under the name Larry Lurex.\nSolo Albums:\n- Mr. Bad Guy (1985): Had a hit in the UK top 10; his posthumous 1993 remix single of “Living on My Own” peaked at No. 1\n- Barcelona (1988): For soprano Montserrat Caballé; their Olympic anthem single “Barcelona.”\nSingles\n- “Love Kills” (1984) reached No. 10 in the UK.\n- “The Great Pretender” (1987) peaked at No. 5 in the UK.\nMercury also collaborated with some other stars, such as Michael Jackson, Billy Squier, and Dave Clark to make his mark on the history of music.\nLove Life and Relationships\nThe personal life of Freddie Mercury is replete with passionate and meaningful relationships, which have been a considerable input into this unique flavor for his story.\nMary Austin\nIn the early 1970s, Mercury started a long-term affair with Mary Austin, whom he met through guitarist Brian May. They actually broke up in 1976 because of a romance but remained best friends, and Mercury always addressed her as his only true friend. He even left his London home for Austin, whom he called his “common-law wife.”\nDavid Minns\nIn the mid-1970s, Mercury began an affair with American record executive David Minns that broke up his relationship with Austin.\nBarbara Valentin\nHe even lived with Barbara Valentin, a popular Austrian actress, before moving into his apartment. He lived freely in Munich and was surrounded by the gay scene. He was deeply in love with German restaurateur Winfried “Winnie” Kirchberger.\nJim Hutton\nBy 1985, Mercury was with his long-term Irish hairdresser, Jim Hutton. Hutton took care of the pop star during his battle with HIV/AIDS and stayed with him until Mercury’s death. Mercury was cremated wearing a gold wedding band from Hutton on his finger. These he had worn from Hutton.\nKenny Everett\nHis most well-known was his relationship with radio DJ Kenny Everett. Everett had mentored Mercury and publicized Queen’s smash “Bohemian Rhapsody.” Again, his relationship with Everett was frequently strained due to health problems and media scrutiny, but they made amends in 1989 just before Everett’s death.\nWas Freddie Mercury gay?\nFreddie Mercury’s sexual orientation was one of the cornerstones of public discourse and conversation throughout his lifetime. While he was “openly gay” for some, others wondered if he indeed did not want to let people know aspects of his private life. When, in 1974, he was asked whether he was gay, he replied quite ambiguously, saying how much he disliked going into details. Even though “openly flamboyant” on stage, Mercury was far from being associated with LGBTQ causes and, by all means, political outness.\nWhat did Freddie Mercury get diagnosed with?\nFreddie Mercury had symptoms of HIV/AIDS in 1982. In the biographical book, Somebody to Love: The Life, Death, and Legacy of Freddie Mercury, Matt Richards and Mark Langthorne disclose that Mercury had secretly gone to a New York City doctor to have a white lesion on his tongue checked. This is an early sign that could have heralded infection. By 1986, Mercury’s health had already been the source of public speculation—especially after Queen went on hiatus, and he did not look good.\nWhat did Freddie say before he died?\nOn November 23, 1991, Mercury confirmed his diagnosis publicly with a statement: “I have tested HIV positive and have AIDS.” He looked at the camera and said, I still love you, to his fans. The next day, he died at his home in Kensington from bronchial pneumonia caused by AIDS at the age of 45.",

Echoing across the forecourt were chants demanding an end to the spread of Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMOs), underscoring the community’s frustration and urgency for action.\nSameh Habeeb stands united with Perivale residents in their call for the council to address their concerns. The residents’ fears about safety and neighborhood integrity are genuine and deserve serious attention. Habeeb added that Ealing Council is rushing into approving more HMOs instead of finding long term solutions which is more affordable housing and controlled rent.\nLocal residents complained that “The escalating presence of HMOs, often linked to antisocial behaviour, poses a real threat to Perivale residents’ well-being. Revelations of potentially higher HMO numbers than officially reported highlight the gravity of the situation.”\nIt’s unacceptable that the council’s response has been perceived as inadequate. Residents feel abandoned and unprotected, with council officers seemingly unable or unwilling to address their concerns.\nAs a community advocate, Sameh Habeeb pledges unwavering support to Perivale residents in their struggle against an ineffective council and opportunistic landlords. It’s time for meaningful action, and he vows to amplify the residents’ voices to ensure their concerns are heard and acted upon promptly.\nFurthermore, Sameh Habeeb urges Ealing Council to prioritize genuine engagement with residents and ensure that their voices are heard and respected in decision-making processes. A disconnect between the council and the community only exacerbates tensions and leads to a lack of trust in local governance.\nMoreover, the relentless pursuit of more HMOs primarily benefits wealthy landlords at the expense of local residents. We must question the necessity for additional housing in the borough and challenge the flawed housing policies of Ealing Council, which have failed to address the needs of the community adequately.\nSameh added that “it is imperative for Ealing Council to reevaluate its housing policies and prioritise the well-being and interests of local residents over the profits of a few. Only through genuine collaboration and responsive governance can we build a stronger and more inclusive community for all residents of Ealing North.”\nPhoto:\nProtest against HMOs in Perivale outside Ealing Council (credit: Rory Bennett/MyLondon).",

  "https_samehhabeeb_uk_/https_samehhabeeb_uk_people_ealing-people_caroline-mary-aherne/content_115.html": "Caroline Mary Aherne 24 December 1963 – 2 July 2016, was an English actress, comedian, writer, and director. Being clever and fresh with the touch to specify the humor in the lives of millions who walk around with the names of the characters like that of the chat show host Mrs. Merton, varied roles in The Fast Show, and characterizing as Denise Royle in The Royle Family, Caroline was able to win multiple works on television BAFTA awards.\nShe ensured her legacy would forever be placed in the comedy world as a trendsetter. The comedian also won in life through her career. Aherne presented Channel 4’s reality show Gogglebox from its launch in 2013 until spring 2016, several months before her death. She had fought personal struggles and artistic successes throughout her lifetime when she died of cancer at 52.\nEarly Life: A Journey From Wythenshawe to Fame\nCaroline Aherne was born 24 December 1963, in Ealing, London to Irish parents Bartholomew “Bert” Aherne-a, a railwayman Mary Frances “Maureen” Aherne (née Regan). When Caroline was two, her family moved to Wythenshawe, Manchester.\nThis fell into a life blighted by phases of ill-health, beginning early with retinoblastoma, a cancer that deprived her of proper vision in one eye. Given these handicaps, it says much for Ahern’s flair and personality as she developed these gifts in West Didsbury’s Hollies Convent FCJ School followed by Xaverian College Rusholme, to finally complete formal drama training with Liverpool Poly.\nBreaking into Comedy\nAherne started doing comedy on the Manchester circuit with several eccentric characters such as Mitzi Goldberg, an amusing country comedian singer, and Sister Mary Immaculate, a barking-mad Irish nun. In 1988 she had a significant breakthrough with her voice as Mrs. Merton on Frank Sidebottom’s album 5:9:88. She immediately became a successful character; an ironic portrayal of a softspoken but quick-tongued interviewee. Then, there was radio, and Aherne joined KFM Radio in Stockport with Craig Cash. She was witty and funny, so it was a natural progression for her to branch out into television.\nTelevision Beginnings\nFirst screen appearance in Mrs. Merton for Granada’s Upfront in 1990. Presented their own comedy chat show, The Mrs Merton Show in 1994 when she came out with this notorious one for Debbie McGee: “What first attracted you to the millionaire Paul Daniels?” A hallmark of such irreverent humor is typical of Aherne’s style. She won the BAFTA Best Talk Show for this show in 1997.\nThe Royle Family: A Cultural Phenomenon\nCaroline Aherne was very proud of the series she co-created and co-wrote with Craig Cash, who also starred alongside her in The Royle Family, which began in 1998. She humorously shadowed a working-class family’s life through this comedy-drama, playing the terribly lazy and pungent sardonic Denise Royle.\nThe show ran to three series and several Christmas specials, winning BAFTAs for Best Sitcom in 2000 and 2007. Aherne also won a BAFTA for Best Comedy Performance in 2000. It was her gift to play well-rounded, even flawed characters who resonated both with audiences and critics.\nThe Fast Show and Other Big Hits\nOne other great show where Aherne was the lead was The Fast Show, in which she gave the world those memorable characters “Our Janine,” the teen mom, and Paula Fisch, the meteorologist with that unforgettable catchphrase, “Scorchio! She could be a one-woman company, doing many different characters with great aplomb.\nOther shows she has produced are comedies Mrs Merton and Malcolm, the critically acclaimed Dossa and Joe, and The Security Men. Among the products she produced mixed reviews were returned by some productions but creativity in her work also reflected a light sense of humor through all other productions she led.\nMarriage and Problems\nIn 1994, she married Peter Hook, the bassist of Joy Division and New Order. In 1997, the couple divorced after Hook narrated a spate of abuse he endured. The case highlighted the issues of husband abuse and encouraged many to discuss their problems and reach out to male victims.\nChallenging Battles with Health and Mental Well-being\nAherne had the worst health conditions throughout her life. She was diagnosed with bladder cancer, lung cancer, and retinoblastoma. In addition, she had depression and alcoholism; she received medical interventions after an attempt to commit suicide in 1998.\nDespite all these chronic conditions, Aherne used them as inspiration to touch and connect people. In cancers, Aherne supported various projects, asking people to laugh and socialize over the sharing of difficulties.\nGogglebox and Last Projects\nThere was another stage of Aherne’s career when she entered the Channel 4 reality show Gogglebox. In this pseudo-series, people comment on television shows with their family and friends. Her gentle narrative with a gentle touch added some specialness to the series.\nIn the latter part of her life, Aherne was featured in the Sky One show After Hours with Craig Cash. She also voiced the UK government’s “One You” health campaign, urging citizens to lead healthier lifestyles.\nIn 2016, she told some of her close friends and family members that she had terminal lung cancer. Caroline Aherne died on 2 July 2016 at her home in Timperley. Caroline Aherne leaves behind laughter and humor.\nCaroline Aherne: A Lasting Memory\nEven after death, Caroline Aherne’s show remained alive, especially after comedy with a break in the norm and her fresh input on Mrs Merton and remaining popular with the family and its simple joys in “The Royle Family.”.\nShe can tackle deeply important subjects, with all the wit and sensitivity infused into ultra-relatable characters that make her iconic in the tale of British television. For just as Aherne’s tale reminds us, there is potency in being funny, resolute, and a bit real in the face of life’s many knockdowns.\nClose friends, fellow co-stars, and fans attended her funeral in July 2016. Just a few months later, in October, Steve Coogan saluted her memory by showing some of her best TV moments in a tribute screening at a Stand Up to Cancer event.",

Bukayo represents both Arsenal and the club, but on international duty he also represents the team of England, for he is the only good player with this kind of talent, as he has great creativity combined with pure hard work throughout his games, like when playing within his formation.\nHe spent the entirety of his first-team club career playing for Arsenal and won the FA Cup and two FA Community Shields while becoming progressively one of the team’s key players. He has been the club’s Player of the Season both for the 2020–21 and the 2021–22 seasons.\nEarly life\nBukayo Ayoyinka Temidayo Saka was born on 5 September 2001 in Ealing, Greater London, to Yoruba Nigerian parents, Adenike and Yomi Saka, the youngest of two children. His parents migrated to London from Nigeria as economic migrants. Saka attended Edward Betham Church of England Primary School before Greenford High School, where he achieved high grades in his GCSEs, gaining four A*s and three As. Before signing for Arsenal, Saka played youth football for local club Greenford Celtic.\nWhich area of Ealing is Bukayo Saka from?\nBukayo Saka was born in the Ealing district of Greater London by Nigerian parents.

Saka attended Edward Betham Church of England Primary School before moving to Greenford High School, where he graduated with four A*s and three in his GCSEs. He was first in the local youth team known as Greenford Celtic before joining Arsenal.\nHow much is Saka worth?\nNow though he is said to have a net worth of $4m—using figures from caknowledge.com—this equates to about £3.3m. Some way behind Arsenal’s leader and also top on the signing of Gabriel Jesus in the summer, whose worth was valued at around £20m. Of course, Bukayo Saka still has loads of time and might close up this gap.\nHas Saka ever taken and scored a free kick?\nBukayo Saka’s direct free-kick against PSG was Arsenal’s first direct free-kick scored in the Champions League since Thierry Henry scored one against Roma in November 2002.\nWhat religion is Bukayo?\nBukayo Saka: Arsenal and England star Bukayo Saka spoke of his Christian faith once again after securing a decisive penalty in the Euros quarter-final shoot-out victory over Switzerland. For Saka, it would appear to have been a moment of redemption.\nHow much does Bukayo Saka make?\nBukayo Saka signed a 4-year, $40,560,000 contract with Arsenal F.C. He makes an annual base salary of $10,000. In 2024, Saka’s annual base salary would be $10,140,000, and his cap hit also will be $10,140,000. Source: EPL contract details are generally culled from reputable news.\nHow old was Saka when Arsenal signed him?\nBorn on September 5, 2001, Saka joined the Arsenal academy when he was seven years old. By November 2018, the then-17-year-old took his first start with the first team of Arsenal. Since then, Saka has become one of the most inspiring footballers for the club.\nYouths’ Career\nOn 24 August 2016, Saka came on as a substitute for his first match for the England national under-16 team in a friendly, which England won 3-1 away from home against Romania. Two days later, he played his first game for the team from the start, in a 2-1 loss to the same opponents in another friendly in which he scored. [93] Saka played two matches during the 2017 UEFA Under-16 Development Tournament. He was the runner-up for the under-16 side at the tournament. He made six appearances with one goal in his under-16 career, which he played from 2016 to 2017.\nHis first involvement with the England under-17 team was in the 2017 FA International Tournament, where he came off the bench for the first time on 18 August 2017 in their opening match, a 3–2 home win over Turkey, in which he scored. Saka played once more at the tournament, which England finished as runners-up. He was called up to the squad for the 2018 Torneio Internacional do Algarve, where he played twice as England finished third. Saka was called up to the squad for the 2018 UEFA European Under-17 Championship in England and played in all five of the team’s matches at the tournament.\nSenior career\nOn 4 September 2020, Saka made his first appearance for the England under-21 team, playing in a 6–0 away win over Kosovo in qualification for the 2021 UEFA European Under-21 Championship. On 1 October, Saka was called up to the England senior team for the first time, and he eventually played his international debut as one of the starters in a 3–0 win over Wales. After playing four times for England, Saka is now committed to England internationally and can never play for Nigeria again.\nSaka was named in a 26-man squad for the UEFA Euro 2020. In a friendly against Austria on 2 June, he made his first international goal in what proved to be an only goal to a 1–0 victory. He came into the team for the third Euro 2020 group stage game between England and the Czech Republic played on 22 June and won the man of the match award. At the final game on 11 July against Italy, Saka was also brought on at halftime after Kieran Trippier got injured.\nPersonal life\nSaka’s favorite footballer is Thierry Henry, and he claims Alexis Sánchez as his influence, saying he even tried to copy Sánchez’s boots when he was an academy player. Among past teammates, Saka said David Luiz helped him the most in his career, saying “he went out of his way” to help a lot of Arsenal youngsters “on and off the pitch.”.\nSaka is a devout Christian, and in interviews, he said he reads the Bible every night. In March 2024, Saka launched his range of peri-peri sauces branded ‘PERi-PERi Saka’ at the Nando’s restaurant chain.",
  "https_samehhabeeb_uk_/https_samehhabeeb_uk_people_ealing-people_neil-kinnock-a-life-in-politics-and-his-ealing-roots/content_86.html": "Neil Kinnock, Baron Kinnock, PC, is a prominent figure in Welsh politics who has greatly defined the modern Labour Party. Born on 28 March 1942, Kinnock served in key political positions and became the Labour Party leader, with a later appointment as leader of the opposition from 1983-1992. He was vice president of the European Commission from 1999 until 2004. He left a solid mark on social justice and public service through the implementation of his strong commitment to progressive values.\nWho is Neil Kinnock?\nNeil Kinnock’s contribution to British and European politics will be monumental in character and profoundly enduring. Given that Neil steered the Labour Party through highly turbulent times, it was quite solid ground to have eventually turned into a contemporary centrist movement. His deep commitment to the cause of progressive values coupled with an incredible facility to yield to political tides made Neil Kinnock one of the most important figures of contemporary British politics.\nWhere was Neil Kinnock born?\nNeil Kinnock was born in Tredegar, Wales, to Gordon Herbert Kinnock and Mary Howells. His father was a former coal miner who later became a laborer, and his mother was a district nurse. Both of his parents died within a month of each other in late 1971. However, this personal tragedy aside, Kinnock’s working-class background instilled in him a deep sense of the struggles of ordinary people.\nHe then attended Lewis School, Pengam, which he condemned for its corporal punishment. Subsequently, he attended the University College of South Wales and Monmouthshire in Cardiff, where he graduated in Industrial Relations and History in 1965. In 1966, he completed a postgraduate diploma in education, and from then until 1970, he was a tutor for the Workers’ Educational Association.\nMember of Parliament\nKinnock began his active political life in 1970 when he was elected Labour MP for Bedwellty, which later changed its name to Islwyn. Known for his principled stance, his father once told him, “MP stands not just for Member of Parliament, but also for Man of Principle.” This remained a guiding force in Kinnock’s career throughout.\nAs a young MP, Neil Kinnock argued for Britain to leave the European Communities in a referendum of 1975. Neil showed then his independent propensity. He also remained a sharp flyer and came into Labour’s National Executive Committee in 1978 as well as Shadow Secretary for Education in 1979 after James Callaghan.\nLeading the Labour Party\nAfter Michael Foot resigned in October 1983, following a general election defeat, Kinnock became the new leader of Labour. This period of his leadership spelled modernization in the party and a distance from its hard-left factions, above all, the Militant tendency, whose racist campaigns and notorious Hitler slogan could no longer be tolerated by Kinnock. Above all, through reform and media campaigning, Labour found a position again away from the Conservative Party.\nFirst Leadership Phase (1983-1987)\nNeil Kinnock experienced many problems, including the widely criticized miners’ strike by Arthur Scargill and infighting with Militant-dominated local councils, during his first few years as party leader. Despite this, he managed to renew Labour’s profile and policies while the party still firmly remained in opposition to both the SDP-Liberal Alliance and a strong Conservative government under Margaret Thatcher.\nSecond Leadership Period (1987–1992)\nAfter Labour’s defeat in the 1987 general election, Kinnock launched a comprehensive policy review known as “Labour Listens,” aimed at bringing the party’s platform into line with public opinion. Dropped commitment to unilateral nuclear disarmament, as well as an emphasis on social-democratic values rather than on state ownership.\nInternational focus on Kinnock’s leadership in 1987 was when then-Senator Joe Biden had a speech he published that later it revealed was plagiarized from a speech during a U.S. presidential debate. This resulted in the withdrawal of Biden from the race but eventually created a lifelong friendship between the two politicians.\nAlthough Labour maintained its steady forward march, another electoral defeat followed in 1992 when the Conservatives, led by John Major, defied expectations to squeak out a narrow victory. Kinnock resigned as Labour leader shortly afterward, ending almost a decade at the helm.\nPost-Parliamentary Career\nAfter retiring as Labour Party leader, Kinnock entered European politics. In 1995, the man was appointed the European Union’s transport commissioner and brought his 25 years of service to an end at the House of Commons. The man’s interests in administrative reform and transport policy dominated his life in the European Commission.\nKinnock was the Vice President of the European Commission under Romano Prodi from 1999 to 2004. His period was characterized by efficiency and transparency in the institution. He retired from active politics in 2005 but remained influential in the Labour Party, supporting Ed Miliband’s leadership campaign in 2010.\nNeil Kinnock’s Impact on Modern Labour Politics\nNeil Kinnock’s leadership will be remembered as having defined and transformed the Labour Party into being competitive and electable in the British political mainstream. His concern in addressing internal differences and modifying policy helped prepare some of the necessary groundwork for the New Labour years of Tony Blair.\nKinnock’s insistence on public relations, media participation, and getting party policies ‘in tune with the people’s mood’ marks a departure point from old Labour approaches. His ability to stand firm against extremism within the party demonstrated his leadership strength. Although he was never Prime Minister, Kinnock’s reforms laid a basis that enabled the landslide victory in 1997, securing his position in history.\nHow Many Children Does Neil Kinnock Have?\nNeil Gordon Kinnock: Married to Glenys Kinnock, Baroness Kinnock of Holyhead, 1967-2023. The couple had two children, Stephen Kinnock and Rachel Kinnock. The couple has two grandkids, Milo Kinnock and Johanna Kinnock. Decades of marriage for Glenys and Neil have shared a deep personal and political bond, greatly supporting one another’s lives and causes.\nPersonal Life and Legacy\nKinnock’s life has been a result of his working-class background and consistent pursuit of social justice. While modernizing the Labour Party that eventually brought in Tony Blair, who took Britain back to being in power by 1997, Kinnock himself could never be at the helm. On political fronts, Kinnock is also involved in cultural and historical activities. In 2011, he was featured on the Welsh family history program “Coming Home,” exploring new aspects of his heritage.",

  "https_samehhabeeb_uk_/https_samehhabeeb_uk_people_ealing-people_john-mitch-mitchell-a-legendary-drummer-from-ealing-and-the-jimi-hendrix-experience/content_84.html": "John Graham “Mitch” Mitchell (9 July 1946–12 November 2008) was an English drummer and child actor, best known for his work in the Jimi Hendrix Experience, for which he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992. He was inducted into the Modern Drummer Hall of Fame in 2009. In 2016, Mitchell was ranked number 8 in Rolling Stone magazine’s list of the “100 Greatest Drummers of All Time.”.\nBiography\nMitchell was born in Ealing, Middlesex, to Phyliss C. (née Preston) and Thomas J. Mitchell on 9 July 1946 (although several modern sources have incorrectly claimed that he was born in 1947). As a 13-year-old, he had a leading role in the British film Bottoms Up (1960) with Jimmy Edwards.[8] As a teenager, he starred in a children’s television program, Jennings at School, and also had a big part in the 1963 film Live It Up!, which starred Heinz Burt, David Hemmings, and Steve Marriott.\nMitchell became a musician by spending his Saturdays working at Jim Marshall’s drum shop while still in school. The main influences on him among drummers were Elvin Jones and Tony Williams. [9] One of his earliest bands was the Soul Messengers, founded in November 1963 at the Ealing Club with tenor saxophonist Terry Marshall (born 15 March 1944), son of Jim Marshall. [10] Mitchell left the band around July 1964.\nThe Jimi Hendrix Experience\nMitchell auditioned for the Jimi Hendrix Experience on 6 October 1966 [13] and was chosen over Aynsley Dunbar in a coin toss. Mitchell’s fast, driving, jazz-influenced playing meshed well with Hendrix’s open-ended, revolutionary approach to the electric guitar. He played on the three best-selling Experience studio albums, Are You Experienced (1967), Axis: Bold as Love (1968), and Electric Ladyland (1968).\nMitchell stayed with Hendrix after the Experience split in June 1969, following Noel Redding’s resignation. He played in Hendrix’s new extended lineup at Woodstock in August 1969. Mitchell was briefly replaced by Buddy Miles for the Band of Gypsys album (1970) but rejoined Hendrix (with Billy Cox on bass) for the April–September 1970 Cry of Love Tour.\nWas Mitch Mitchell a great drummer?\nMitchell began his professional career with the Hendrix Experience, playing a Premier drum kit in England and Europe in 1967. When the Experience traveled to the US for the Monterey Pop Music Festival in June 1967, Mitchell was playing that same set. He remained with Ludwig until later in the summer when he started playing on a Ludwig drum set, stayed there throughout 1967, then on through 1968 and into 1969. For his last year of recording with the Hendrix Experience, he changed over to a double bass Gretsch drum set in 1970. Except for the 1969 Woodstock Music Festival, in which he played a Rodgers Powertone snare drum, during his tenure with the JHE, Mitch played a Ludwig Supraphonic 400, a 5- by 14-inch metal snare drum. Much later, and until his untimely passing, he played DW drums.\nDiscography\n- 1966: Georgie Fame — Sweet Things\n- 1967: Wishful Thinking — Count to Ten (Decca F12598, UK, DK)\n- 1967: The Jimi Hendrix Experience — Are You Experienced\n- 1967: The Jimi Hendrix Experience — Axis: Bold As Love\n- 1968: The Jimi Hendrix Experience — Electric Ladyland\n- 1969: Martha Veléz — Fiends and Angels\n- 1971: Jimi Hendrix — The Cry of Love\n- 1971: Jimi Hendrix — Rainbow Bridge\n- 1972: Jimi Hendrix — War Heroes\n- 1972: Ramatam — Ramatam\n- 1975: Mitch Mitchell — Squeeze My Little Finger / Put Your Faith in Me\n- 1980: Roger Chapman — Mail Order Magic\n- 1986: Greg Parker — Black Dog\n- 1996: David Torn—What Means Solid, Traveller?\n- 1998: Junior Brown — Long Walk Back\n- 1999: Bruce Cameron — Midnight Daydream\nOther Projects\n- Dirty Mac (December 1968): An impromptu band featuring John Lennon, Eric Clapton, Keith Richards, and Yoko Ono.\n- Jack Bruce and Friends: Collaborated with Jack Bruce, Mike Mandel, and Larry Coryell from late 1969 to early 1970.\nWhat Did Mitch Mitchell Do After Hendrix?\nAfter Hendrix’s death, Mitchell completed production work with engineer Eddie Kramer on incomplete Hendrix recordings, which led to the releases of The Cry of Love and Rainbow Bridge. In 1972, he joined forces with guitarists Mike Pinera and April Lawton to form Ramatam. They cut the first of Ramatam’s two albums and were an opening act for Emerson, Lake & Palmer at several shows.\nMitchell and Hendrix had been invited to join the band Keith Emerson and Greg Lake were putting together, but Carl Palmer landed the drum slot instead. Ramatam never reached commercial success, and Mitchell departed the act before their second album was released. He also toured with Terry Reid, Jack Bruce, and Jeff Beck as the drummer for Cozy Powell during three tours.\nMitchell was part of the 2008 Experience Hendrix Tour that, for nearly four weeks in October and November 2008, traveled on an 18-city tour of the US, finishing in Portland, Oregon. Other artists that took part in the tour were Billy Cox, Buddy Guy, Jonny Lang, Robby Krieger, Kenny Wayne Shepherd, Eric Johnson, Cesar Rosas, David Hidalgo, Brad Whitford, Hubert Sumlin, Chris Layton, Eric Gales, and Mato Nanji.\nWhat was the cause of the death of Mitch Mitchell?\nFive days after the tour concluded, Mitchell died in his sleep on 12 November of natural causes in his room at the Benson Hotel in Portland. Mitchell had been suffering from an immune system disorder and cancer for many years. He had experienced severe bouts of exhaustion in 2007 and 2008 but had recovered within a few days of rest. By the end of the 2008 show, however, Mitchell was performing only two or three songs and always accompanied by a backup drummer. At his last show in Portland, Oregon, Mitchell was so frail that his drum technician and tour manager asked him to skip the entire concert.",

  "https_samehhabeeb_uk_/https_samehhabeeb_uk_people_ealing-people_dorothea-lambert-chambers-a-tennis-legend-from-ealing/content_104.html": "Dorothea Lambert Chambers is no less than one of the iconic names that emerged in the history of tennis in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The seven titles she won in the women’s singles championship of Wimbledon, the gold medal won in the 1908 Summer Olympics, and the numerous championships that were won under her name make her one of the greatest tennis players in history.\nEarly Life and Introduction to Tennis\nDorothea Katherine Douglass was born in London, England. There is little information known about her childhood. This is where she developed a love for the game right from a very young age. Within a short time, tennis becomes one of her vital interests. She played her first match at Wimbledon in the year 1900 in some of the glitziest championships of the game of tennis but was in no way close to being as big as she failed in the second round of the tournament. She had huge potential reflected in the game and later dominated it.\nRise to Greatness: Wimbledon and International Excellence\nThe first success of Douglass at Wimbledon came in 1903 when she won her first women’s singles title after the defeat of Ethel Thomson. Winning seven singles titles at Wimbledon is surely great enough to cement her name in the tennis history books.\nThe victory came once more in 1904 and made her consecutively-obtained Wimbledon champion. She, again defeated, Charlotte Cooper Sterry, and just as often over before that.\nThen, too swept to triumph to the big one at the end of succeeding years, finally gave her an addition to her reputation as great fame as one of the magnificent woman tennis players. With each successive Wimbledon win, she consolidated her position as one of the toughest-playing women in the world and ensured herself that status for many more years to come.\nWho Did Dorothea Chambers Marry?\nIn 1907 she married Robert Lambert Chambers, and thereafter, she was known by the name Dorothea Lambert Chambers. She, in any case, did not become less competitive; on the contrary, the desire to get married seemed to inspire her to go even higher up the tennis ladder. She continued at the top in this event also and showed determination and prowess in abundance.\nWhat was Dorothea Lambert Chambers’ achievement at the 1908 Summer Olympics?\nPerhaps one of the most memorable performances in the career of Dorothea Lambert Chambers was when she participated in the Summer Olympics in 1908. There, she clinched the gold in the women’s singles category. In her quest to take the gold in the final, she overcame fellow compatriot British player Dora Boothby with a scoreline of 6–1, 7–5. Thus she also opened a new dimension in her game by winning that highly prized Olympic trophy, hence becoming the very first British lady to win Olympic gold in the game of tennis.\nDorothea Lambert Chambers’ book Tennis for Ladies\nTennis for Ladies by Dorothea Lambert Chambers, 1910, published the game of tennis through her book called Tennis for Ladies. This pioneering and resourceful book instructed how to play, as it went with some different aspects of the game technique, attire, and equipment. It contained pictures of a high percentage of tennis techniques, but for me, it was a little more akin to an instruction manual for further development to her position as an ambassador for the sport. The book continues to be widely remembered today for being one of the first-ever works on women’s tennis.\nThe Legendary 1911 Wimbledon Final\nDorothea Lambert Chambers made history once again when she defeated Dora Boothby in the ladies’ final at Wimbledon in a sensational 6–0, 6–0 in 1911. She was the first winner of a Grand Slam singles final in the world to have not lost a set in that match. That proved to be one great feat to showcase technical mastery, courageous tenacity, and mental stability in a challenging and nerve-wracking game. Some 80 years later, Steffi Graf would also repeat this magnificent act by winning the French Open final against Natalia Zvereva in 1988.\nRivalries and Tough Times\nWhile there are so many great moments of her very long career, Lambert Chambers did experience much great rivalry as well. Suzie Lenglen was a French player who ended up becoming one of tennis’ greatest players. In 1919, Lambert Chambers appeared in a then-longest Wimbledon final match lasting 44 games, when she failed to outmaneuver Lenglen. For all this, Lambert Chambers had even taken two match points at 6-5 in the set but lost 8-10, 6-4, 7-9. It was one of the most dramatic matches played, and by the tenacity both players demonstrated.\nIn 1920, she appeared in the final of Wimbledon and faced the same Lenglen; she received a heavy mauling at the hands of the same tennis courts. Lambert Chambers got thrashed 3–6, 0–6. Although beaten, Lambert Chambers kept on playing at that same level and proved she was a spirited competitor and ardent sportswoman as well.\nRetirement from Tennis and Shift to Coaching\nBy 1921, Lambert Chambers had retired from the singles courts. Yet, she remained a pretty strict challenger in the doubles game. She played the doubles till 1927 and still remained in the tennis fray. Her final important contribution came when she captained the British team for the Wightman Cup yearly contest between Great Britain and the United States in 1925.\nShe was 46 when she played both singles and doubles matches and emerged victorious in both. This would indicate that the lady had much staying power in the game and a lot of skill.\nBy 1928, Lambert Chambers devoted her time and energy to training and coaching future generations of tennis players, inspired by the experience she had garnered in the game. Her career as a coach sealed her legacy in the game long after she had retired from playing.",

  "https_samehhabeeb_uk_/https_samehhabeeb_uk_people_ealing-people_bob-block-a-master-of-british-comedy-in-ealing/content_67.html": "Bob Block was one of Britain’s most prolific scriptwriters, who forever left his mark on both radio and television comedy. The way he can make something funny, quirky, and interesting earned him a place among the favorite figures of the entertainment world.\nThus, his work became a favorite for both children and adults alike, giving way to a legacy that continues to inspire comedy writers even today. From the classical sitcoms to the surreal children’s series, his work defined many comedic milestones that shaped much of British television, covering decades.\nWho is Bob Block?\nIt’s not possible to overstate the impact of Bob Block on British comedy. He had an innovative approach to storytelling and humor that would change the landscape of television for children and adults alike. Timeless classics like Rentaghost and Galloping Galaxies! bring a smile to people’s faces today, solidifying his status as a comedy legend.\nEarly Life and Career Beginnings\nAs a pioneering one among the first radio comedians to work for Britain, Bob Block began his comedic career very early. With the bright and entertaining script he displayed, much attention was attracted, and it immediately sparked a lot of attention from the audience. The writer for these popular radio variety shows during the 1940s, such as Variety Bandbox and Radio Rinso, ushered in the opening door to Bob Block’s future entry into television.\nHowever, it was his work on the popular domestic sitcom Life with the Lyons (1951–1961) that marked a turning point in his career. The show running for a decade portrayed Block as an able weaver of family dynamics with humor. Life with the Lyons, co-written by Block and starring the American actor Ben Lyon, was one of the earliest significant successes for British sitcoms.\nRadio era: Diversity Portfolios\nNow although perhaps Life with the Lyons was its flagship, to say that his career was only defined by such a program will be an error. Bob Block proved himself very versatile as a writer through several programs in the late 1950s and 1960s, including The Starlight Hour (1950), Arthur’s Inn (1952), and Discord in Three Flats (1962). Each would have its flavor for which Block suited up his writing to fit. This opened wide a radio career for Block, but equally successful was his entrance into television: it is there that he found his niche: children’s programs, which became his hallmark.\nThe Golden Age of Children’s Television\nBy the 1970s, Bob Block devoted more of his time to writing for children’s television, where his imagination took off. Then there was the 1970s and Pardon My Genie, a fantasy slapstick show for the 1972–1973 season. The series was as whimsical in its equal measure of humor as it was about a genie who could grant wishes; it seemed to capture all the imagination its young viewers must have had at the time. Block’s work on Pardon My Genie laid the ground for some of the other unforgettable children’s series he was to pen in the following years.\nThe success of Pardon My Genie prompted Block to come up with another series, Robert’s Robots (1974–1975), a sci-fi comedy where a young boy befriends a group of robots. This one hit it big with the target audience and captured the spirit of the times with its futuristic premise and child-friendly humor.\nDefying Conventions through Surreal Comedy\nBlock had no sign of slowing down his machine in his many years of work experience. Works like Galloping Galaxies! (1985–1986) and Grandad (1979–1984) were seen to be really radical, so radical that the shows could get by with minimal “children’s” programming at all. With adventure brought down to earth with its otherworldly fantasy and zaniness, the space-themed series was ready for adventure on Galloping Galaxies!\nThe very instinctive comedic style of Block brings fantastically complex storylines together with an asset to work with. Another of the hits Block wrote was Grandad from 1979 to 1984. The show was centered around a lad and his failing old grandfather getting on and facing the challenges thrown at them when trying to run a house through the humor, and warmth, but tackling serious subject matters like family and maturity. It thus won huge acclaim for this talented versatile writing and a strong humorous talent author.\nRadio Shows\n-\n- Variety Bandbox (1940s–1950s)\n-\n- Radio Rinso (1950)\n-\n- The Starlight Hour (1950)\n-\n- Life with the Lyons (1951–1961)\n-\n- Festival of Britain (1951)\n-\n- Arthur’s Inn (1952)\n-\n- Discord in Three Flats (1962)\nTelevision Shows\n-\n- Our House (1960)\n-\n- That’s My Boy (1963)\n-\n- Crackerjack (1964–1973)\n-\n- Hey Presto It’s Rolf (1966)\n-\n- Broaden Your Mind (1968–1969)\n-\n- Ken Dodd and the Diddymen (1969–1970)\n-\n- The Dave King Show (1969–1970)\n-\n- Dave Allen At Large (1970–1979)\n-\n- Pardon My Genie (1972–1973)\n-\n- Roberts Robots (1973–1974)\n-\n- Truscott’s Luck\n-\n- Rentaghost (1975–1984)\n-\n- Grandad (1979–1984)\n-\n- Galloping Galaxies! (1985–1986)\nPersonal Life and Family\nOn the personal front, Bob Block was well satiated as well. He married Madeline Gamblin in 1941, and he stayed with her all his life up until he died in 2011. His long and supportive marriage was indeed a big part of Block’s life, personally as well as professionally. It so happens that Block expired on April 17, 2011, at the age of 89; however, legacies live on— inspiring writers and comedians right down to this moment. His production stands as testimony to what creativity, or rather, comedy and wit mixed with the reach of audiences beyond ages.\nThe Lasting Legacy of Bob Block: A True Comedy Pioneer\nBob Block had a long career, from the early days of radio to the colorful world of children’s television. He was a master of British comedy because of his ability to create memorable characters, fantastical plots, and sharp dialogue. Today, Block is remembered for his wit, imagination, and his lasting impact on the world of television. His work inspires and entertains even now and makes sure that the laughter he created will continue for generations to come.",
  "https_samehhabeeb_uk_/https_samehhabeeb_uk_people_ealing-people_paul-mcgrath-ealings-legendary-defender-journey-from-triumphs-to-trials/content_83.html": "Paul McGrath (born 4 December 1959) is an Irish former professional footballer who played as a defender. McGrath is generally regarded as one of the greatest defenders of all time, both in the 1980s and 1990s, and was known at Aston Villa as ‘God.’. Mainly a center-back, he also played defensive midfielder. McGrath spent the greater part of his career at Villa and Manchester United for seven seasons apiece. He is only the sixth defender to take away the PFA Players’ Player of the Year award. He had also spent time with St. Patrick’s Athletic, Derby County, and Sheffield United.\nWhere is Paul McGrath from?\nMcGrath was born in Greenford, Middlesex, to a Nigerian father who met his Irish mother during his medical studies in Dublin. His father disappeared soon after his conception. He happened to be the child of Betty McGrath, who was afraid that his grandfather would discover that she had been pregnant with him outside of marriage and interracially. She traveled secretly to London for the birth of her illegitimate child.\nShe was counseled to give up her son for adoption at the Mother and Baby home in Acton, which occasion she refused many times. After returning to her hometown, Paul was taken from her by force, put into foster care, and later sent to the Smyly Trust Home. The Catholic Crusade members in Dublin organized and carried out this action. Betty McGrath assumed that she placed him up for fostering in Ireland when he was four weeks old\nSt Patrick’s Athletic\nStreet art dedicated to McGrath outside Richmond Park, the home ground of the first club St Patrick’s Athletic. McGrath made his League of Ireland debut for St Patrick’s Athletic against Shamrock Rovers in a League of Ireland Cup match at Richmond Park on 30 August 1981. He scored the winner in his next game in a Leinster Senior Cup clash.\nPaul McGrath (Dalkey United) and John Cleary (Ballyfermot United). Given a time and a little encouragement, I feel that by the end of the season, they will have done the club proud.” He ended up being one of the greats at The Saints, earning the nickname “The Black Pearl of Inchicore” and winning the PFAI Players’ Player of the Year award for 1982.\nManchester United\nHe joined Manchester United, where he was in the care of Ron Atkinson, in 1982. In the subsequent year, McGrath was left out of the FA Cup match against Brighton & Hove Albion but took Gordon McQueen’s place just in time to dislodge him and directly become a first-choice center-half alongside Kevin Moran.\nIn 1985–86, it seemed that McGrath was going to collect a league title medal as United won their first 10 league games of the season, but injuries to key players, including Bryan Robson, soon took their toll on the side, and they eventually finished fourth in the table, 12 points behind champions Liverpool.\nA dismal start to the 1986–87 season saw Ron Atkinson sacked as manager and replaced by Alex Ferguson in November 1986, but McGrath initially remained a regular member of the first team. United finished second behind Liverpool in the league a year later.\nBy the 1988–89 season, McGrath was struggling with knee injuries and was becoming a less regular member of the first team, facing competition from new signings Steve Bruce and Mal Donaghy. His relationship with manager Ferguson was becoming strained.\nAston Villa\nIn the late 1980s, McGrath received terms from S.S.C. Napoli, but this did not work out. McGrath joined Aston Villa in August 1989. During his time at Villa, McGrath played some of the best football in his career, even though he often had problems in his knees. Villa narrowly lost the title in McGrath’s first season, being defeated by Liverpool to take second place.\nThis was under new manager Jozef Vengloš, who was the first top-flight manager to come from the European continent. After Vengloš’s only season (1990–91) alone at Villa, Ron Atkinson arrived, strengthening a reasonable set of players well in the opening Premier League season. Aston Villa once more made runners-up, this time to Manchester United, during their inaugural season for the Premier League in 1992–93.\nInternational Career\nIn 1990, the Republic of Ireland qualified for its first FIFA World Cup, in 1990 in Italy, eventually reaching the quarter-finals, where they lost to the hosts (1–0 in Rome), with McGrath ever present in the lineups (five matches, 480 minutes played). He captained the team four times in 1992 after the retirement of Mick McCarthy.\nIn the Republic of Ireland’s opening game of the 1994 World Cup—a 1–0 win against favorites Italy, thanks to Ray Houghton’s early goal—in a perfect example of his commitment to the game, McGrath put up an astonishing defensive performance despite excruciating knee problems, including blocking a shot from Roberto Baggio with his face\nWhen Did Paul McGrath Die?\nPaul’s half-sister Okune McGrath died in March 1994 due to complications stemming from a lifelong rare blood disorder. Their mother, Betty McGrath-Lowth, died on 4 September 2020, aged 83.\nAlcohol Addiction\nDue to the trauma of his early life and the subsequent alcoholism, McGrath has, in interviews and through his autobiography, discussed the fact that he lived through at least four major suicide attempts in his life. One of the first chances came in November 1989 after Manchester United sold him to Aston Villa. McGrath returned to play for Aston Villa on 5 November 1989 in a 6–2 victory over Everton, but during the game had to hide wounds to his wrists using wristbands.\nUntil he got his drinking under control in the 2010s, the fragility of McGrath’s long-term mental health affected his family life; McGrath has been divorced twice. In 2019, McGrath said he was roughly functional since 2014, although he admitted to still occasionally drinking.\nHow many children does Paul McGrath have?\nMcGrath is the father of five sons and a daughter, and as of 2019, five grandchildren.",
  "https_samehhabeeb_uk_/https_samehhabeeb_uk_people_ealing-people_lillian-board-ealings-silver-sprint-star-and-her-legacy-in-athletics/content_117.html": "Lillian Board (13 December 1948–26 December 1970) was a British athlete. She won the silver medal in the 400 meters at the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City and two gold medals at the 1969 European Championships in Athletics in Athens. Her career was cut short in 1970 when she developed the colorectal cancer that within months would claim her life at the age of 22.\nEarly years\nBoard was born on 13 December 1948 in Durban, South Africa. Her parents, George and Frances Board, had immigrated from Manchester, England, in April 1947 with their son, George Alfred. Feeling increasingly homesick after the birth of Lillian and her fraternal twin sister, Irene, the family returned to Manchester in February 1950.\nWho was Lillian Board married to?\nAt the time of her death, Lillian was engaged to sports journalist David Emery. He was with her throughout her illness. After her death, he married her twin sister Irene. She was the only female panelist on the first nationwide edition of BBC TV’s quiz show A Question of Sport, broadcast on 5 January 1970.\nThe other panelists were footballers George Best and Tom Finney and cricketer Ray Illingworth (the team captains were boxer Henry Cooper and rugby player Cliff Morgan, and the presenter was David Vine.) The recording of this historic edition of one of television’s most popular and durable programs (now in its 54th year) is missing from the BBC archives.\nInternational Success\nLilian has achieved a lot of international success during various seasons:\n1966 season\nBoard’s performances at 400 m in the 1966 season earned her a place in the England team for the Commonwealth Games held in Kingston, Jamaica, that August. Here, after winning her 400 m heat (54.7), Board finished fifth in the final in a time of 54.7 seconds, just outside her personal best. It was a very creditable effort for a 17-year-old. Unfortunately, she was not selected for the Great Britain team at the European Championships in Budapest, which took place between 30 August and 4 September.\n1967 season\nBoard firmly announced her arrival onto the international scene when, still aged only 18, she won the 400 m race in a Commonwealth v. USA match in Los Angeles, California, on 9 July 1967. She came from last to first with a stunning late surge and won in a time of 52.8 seconds, the second fastest ever recorded by a European woman. The race was broadcast live on British television and made her a household name.\nShe built on this watershed success by running four victories at 400 m in five international races, perhaps the most significant in claiming Britain’s only win for its women in the 1967 European Cup final on 15 September in Kyiv.\nScoring Big in the 1968 season and Olympic Games\nBoard began the 1968 season with a victory in the 440-yard race at an inter-club meeting in Brighton, her time of 54.8 comfortably inside the Olympic qualifying standard. She then jumped to the top of the world rankings after winning over 400 m (53.5) at an international meeting in Moscow.\nHowever, at the Women’s AAA championships in July, she spurned the chance of an almost certain victory in the 400 m and instead decided to contest the 800 meters. Having won her heat (2:05.7), she then revealed enormous potential in this event with a superb 2:02.0—the second fastest ever by a British woman—to finish 2nd to the reigning European 800 m champion, Vera Nikolic of Yugoslavia, whose time of 2:00.5 was a new world record.\n1969 season and European Championships\nIn 1969, Board opened the season with a new personal best 100m of 11.9 and a 52.9 to contribute to a 4 × 400m world record of 3:37.6, but in early July strained ligaments in her back, which meant missing a further five weeks of the season. She returned in August with a 52.5 anchor leg in the 4 × 400 m relay to help Great Britain defeat the USA in an international match at London’s White City.\nAwards and Honors\nHere is a list of awards she has won:\n-\n-\n- Voted ‘Sportswoman of the Year’ for 1968 by the Sports Journalists’ Association.\n-\n-\n-\n- Best Woman Athlete in the Games: 1969 European Championships in Athletics.\n-\n-\n-\n- Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) on the New Year Honors List for 1970 in recognition of her services in athletics\n-\n-\n-\n- Sportswoman of the Year for 1970 for Rebecca Lyne from the 2006 edition of the 800 m by bronze medal was won at the European Athletics Championships this year. Lillian Board has a bronze for which she says she has been given.\n-\nTitles and Records\nHere are some titles and records achieved by the Lilian Board:\n-\n-\n- Won six titles at the WAAA’s Championships, including the 440-yard title in 1967.\n-\n-\n-\n- Set 11 UK records, including a 400 m record of 52.12 in 1968.\n-\n-\n-\n- Helped set four relay world records (at 4 × 110 yards, 4 × 400 m (twice), and 4 × 800 m) between September 1968 and June 1970, running the anchor/last leg each time.\n-\nWhat happened to Lillian Board?\nShe was an obvious choice as the 1969 Nos Galan Mystery Runner, but, tragically, it was less than a year later that the world was in mourning over her untimely death at the age of 22. Lillian Board died of cancer on December 26, 1970, almost a year to the day when she was the Nos Galan Mystery Runner. Soon after the mile race in Rome, she started suffering from stomach upsets. These were diagnosed as a virus, and she was prescribed pills.\nShe continued to feel unwell but still managed to contribute a 2:07.0 leg to a 4 × 800 m world record on 13 June in Edinburgh. She ran 2:06.8 six days later when winning her 800 m heat at the Women’s AAA championships at Crystal Palace, London, despite being doubled up in pain before the race. Pale and underweight, she then finished a tired third (2:05.1) in the 800 m final on 20 June.\nWhere is Lillian Board buried?\nPutney Vale Cemetery and Crematorium, London, United Kingdom.",

  "https_samehhabeeb_uk_/https_samehhabeeb_uk_people_ealing-people_exploring-sir-ian-livingstone-legacy-in-ealing-and-beyond/content_96.html": "Sir Ian Livingstone CBE (born 29 December 1949) is an English fantasy author and entrepreneur. He is perhaps best known for co-founding the Fighting Fantasy series of role-playing gamebooks with Steve Jackson. He also founded Games Workshop in 1975 and played a role in the development of Eidos Interactive as executive chairman of Eidos Plc in 1995.\nEarly life\nLivingstone attended Altrincham Grammar School for Boys, at which he attained only one A-level, Geography. He has maintained strong ties with the school and visited it many times.\nWhat is Games Workshop, and how did Sir Ian Livingstone contribute?\nLivingstone and flatmates John Peake and Steve Jackson started Games Workshop early in 1975. They launched a monthly newsletter, Owl and Weasel, whose first issue was given to fanzine Albion subscribers. A copy fell into the hands of Brian Blume; he reciprocated by mailing them the brand-new game Dungeons & Dragons. Livingstone and Jackson found this game more imaginative than games produced in the UK at the time and so worked out an arrangement with Blume for an exclusive deal to sell D&D in Europe.\nThey started distributing Dungeons & Dragons and other TSR products later in 1975. Livingstone and Jackson organized a convention for the first time in late 1975, which became known as the first Games Day. They were selling the products out of their flat, and customers used to come there looking for a store that did not exist; due to this, their landlord evicted them in the summer of 1976.\nFirst Game Workshop\nUnder the guidance of Livingstone and Jackson, Games Workshop went from being a bedroom mail-order company to becoming a successful gaming manufacturer and retail chain, opening the first Games Workshop store in Hammersmith in 1977. In June of that year, partially to promote the opening, Livingstone and Jackson launched the gaming magazine White Dwarf, with Livingstone as the editor. Livingstone selected the title, which was a concept applicable to the fantasy and science fiction genres as well: the white dwarf referred to a phenomenon in astronomy as well as the fantasy creature type. White Dwarf ended the run of editorship after February 1986’s #74.\nWhat Is the Fighting Fantasy Game Series?\nIn 1982, Jackson and Livingstone co-wrote The Warlock of Firetop Mountain, the first book in the Fighting Fantasy series, but following an instruction from publishers Penguin to write more books “as quickly as possible,” the pair wrote subsequent books separately. The series had sold over 18 million copies as of 2017, with Livingstone’s Deathtrap Dungeon selling over 350,000 copies in its first year alone. Livingstone wrote another twelve Fighting Fantasy gamebooks, including The Forest of Doom, City of Thieves, and Caverns of the Snow Witch, before marking the 30th anniversary of The Warlock of Firetop Mountain with a new gamebook, Blood of the Zombies, in 2012, and with The Port of Peril in 2017 for the 35th anniversary.\nVideo games\nDuring the mid-1980s, Livingstone did design work for video game publisher Domark; he went back to the company in 1993 as a major investor and board member. Later on, Livingstone reflected, “After the success of Games Workshop, I retired, got bored, and invested in Domark to fund their cartridge development. I got in at just the wrong time—it was all going flat.” In 1995, Domark was bought by the video technology company Eidos, which had floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1990, and became the major component of the newly established Eidos plc, whose best-known division is Eidos Interactive. Livingstone resigned as executive chairman in 2002 and was appointed creative director.\nIn 2005, SCi acquired Eidos, and Livingstone was the only past board member retained, becoming product acquisition director. Livingstone helped maintain many of the franchises Eidos had acquired during its time, such as Tomb Raider and Hitman. He was involved in the Tomb Raider project, Tomb Raider: Anniversary, an updated version of the original Tomb Raider video game released in 2007. In 2009, Japanese video game company Square Enix acquired all of Eidos Interactive’s shares, and Livingstone was appointed Life President of Eidos, a role he resigned from in 2013.\nAppearance in Bedrooms to Billions\nIn 2014, Livingstone made an appearance in the documentary feature film From Bedrooms to Billions (2014), a film that chronicles the British Video Games Industry from 1979 till the present. In 2021, Freeway Fighters won an adaptation over Viber and Messenger, a creation of a Talk-a-Bot company over Viber and Messenger. In 2015-2022, he became the non-executive chairman for Sumo Group. He is currently a general partner at Hiro Capital, where the company invested in Skybound Entertainment in 2022.\nWhat is the significance of the NextGen report?\nIn 2010, Livingstone was appointed Skills Champion by government minister Ed Vaizey, who asked him to produce a report reviewing the UK video games industry. The ‘NextGen’ report, co-authored with visual effects firm Double Negative’s Alex Hope, was published in 2011; Livingstone described it as a “complete bottom-up review of the whole education system relating to games.” A school named Livingstone Academy was planned for 2021.\nWhy was Ian Livingstone knighted?\nIn 2002, Livingstone won the BAFTA Interactive Special Award for outstanding contribution to the industry. Livingstone was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2006 New Year Honors and Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2013 New Year Honors, both for services to the computer gaming industry. In 2011, Livingstone received an honorary doctorate of arts from Bournemouth University. Livingstone was awarded a knighthood in the 2022 New Year Honors for her services to the online gaming industry.\nBibliography\nHere is the bibliography:\nFighting Fantasy\n-\n- The Warlock of Firetop Mountain (1982) with Steve Jackson, Puffin Books\n-\n- The Forest of Doom (1983)\n-\n- City of Thieves (1983)\n-\n- Deathtrap Dungeon (1984)\n-\n- Island of the Lizard King (1984)\n-\n- Caverns of the Snow Witch (1984)\n-\n- Freeway Fighter (1985)\n-\n- Temple of Terror (1985)\n-\n- Return to Firetop Mountain (1992)\n-\n- Eye of the Dragon (2005)\n-\n- Blood of the Zombies (2012)\n-\n- The Port of Peril (2017)\n-\n- Assassins of Allansia (2019)\n-\n- Shadow of the Giants (2022)\nFighting Fantasy First Adventures: Adventures of Goldhawk\n-\n- Darkmoon’s Curse (1995)\n-\n- The Demon Spider (1995)\n-\n- Mudworm Swamp (1995)\n-\n- Ghost Road (1995)\nOther works\n-\n- Dicing with Dragons (1982)\n-\n- Eureka!

Habeeb’s initiative will also focus on addressing local concerns and promoting grassroots democracy to ensure the voices of residents are heard and acted upon.\nFollowing the 2024 General Election, in which Habeeb secured nearly 7.3% of the vote with thousands of local residents backing his campaign, it became clear that there is a strong demand for real representation and positive change in Ealing North. This result reflects a growing frustration with the status quo and the need for continuous local engagement beyond election cycles.\n“Shadow MP of Ealing North” Initiative\nHabeeb’s initiative will focus on two key goals: holding James Murray accountable for his performance as MP and engaging the local community in meaningful ways to promote local democracy. The initiative includes the following objectives:\n- Tracking and Reporting on James Murray’s Performance: MP James Murray has served Ealing North for several years but has come under repeated criticism for failing to adequately address the needs of the local community. Residents have reported dissatisfaction with his performance on critical issues such as housing, public transport, healthcare, and local services. As “Shadow MP,” Habeeb will regularly monitor Murray’s parliamentary activities and local efforts, publishing transparent reports to highlight whether he is delivering on his promises to constituents. If Murray continues to fall short, Habeeb will make that information available to the public, empowering voters with the facts they need to hold their MP accountable.\n- A Voice for Neglected Communities: Many communities in Ealing North, especially low-income families, renters, and public sector workers, have felt neglected by their elected representatives. Habeeb’s initiative will focus on providing these communities with a louder voice. He will regularly meet with residents to listen to their concerns and ensure that these issues are raised publicly, applying pressure on the local MP and local government to act on them.\nA Call for Action\nSam Habeeb is encouraging the residents of Ealing North to get involved in this effort to strengthen local democracy and ensure their needs are met. Whether you have a complaint about the performance of the current MP, James Murray, or you simply want to see more action on key issues affecting your community, Habeeb is here to help.\n“My mission is to put power back in the hands of the people. If you feel that your voice has been ignored by James Murray or if your concerns have not been addressed, please reach out to me. I will make sure your concerns are heard, and I will hold those in power accountable,” said Habeeb.\nHe added, “Together, we can ensure that local democracy thrives in Ealing North, and that every resident has the opportunity to participate in the decisions that affect their lives.”\nContact Information\nResidents can contact Sam Habeeb, the “Shadow MP of Ealing North,” to share concerns, file complaints about the performance of James Murray, or get involved in local democratic initiatives.

A career spanning several decades, much of which was spent at Oxford University, Strawson is celebrated as the founder of descriptive metaphysics and an influential figure in 20th-century philosophy.\nWho was Sir Peter Frederick Strawson?\nBorn on 23 November 1919, in Ealing, west London, Strawson was raised in Finchley, north London, where both parents were teachers. Academic life certainly had the nurturing support of intellectual activities in an environment that facilitated the growth of ideas.\nHis talents at Christ’s College in Finchley with rich academic aptitude kept him serving here. Later he attended Philosophy, Politics, and Economics (PPE) at St. John’s College, Oxford, which developed his ideas towards philosophy.\nThe impetus of World War II cut short his education. He joined the Royal Artillery and later was transferred to the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers. During World War II, he achieved some experience during active service. In 1946, he was demobilized as a captain and returned to his academic life, transmuting disciplines learned during military service into scholarship.\nAcademic Career and Professional Life\nHe went on to join the University College of North Wales, Bangor, as an assistant lecturer in 1946. Due to his immense talent and potential, he earned a John Locke scholarship at the University of Oxford. Under Gilbert Ryle, he continued and became a lecturer at University College, Oxford in 1948.\nHe remained closely associated with Oxford all through his life and ended up as Waynflete Professor of Metaphysical Philosophy at Magdalen College from 1968 to 1987.\nHe spent the rest of his life at University College, Oxford, after retiring in 1987. He died in 2006. A cosmopolitan atmosphere for intellectualism made Oxford, during the middle half of the 20th century, one of the world’s greatest forums for philosophy debates.\nWhat is Sir Peter Strawson known for in philosophy?\nThe Landmark Paper: “On Referring”\nEarly recognition was realized with the seminal paper “On Referring” (1950), a critical review of the theory of descriptions by Bertrand Russell. The latter’s influential article in 1905, “On Denoting,” argued that linguistic expressions can systematically refer to entities, existent or nonexistent. Strawson opposed this view with an emphasis on how context and usage determine reference, thus reshaping the philosophical language discourse and providing subsequent developments in analytic philosophy.\nDescriptive vs. Revisionary Metaphysics\nOne of the most lasting contributions that Strawson has made is in distinguishing between descriptive and revisionary metaphysics. In his influential book Individuals, 1959, Strawson developed the principles of descriptive metaphysics, which consist of an articulation of the fundamental structure of our shared conceptual framework.\nWhile revisionary metaphysics is geared toward the formulation of an alternative conceptual scheme, descriptive metaphysics is an uncovering and clarification of preexisting patterns of human thought.\nHe classified Aristotle and Kant as descriptive metaphysicians, whereas revisionary metaphysicians belong to the type of Descartes and Leibniz. His elaborate study of such concepts as spatio-temporal particulars and classifying them in general categories helps shed light upon the deep structures underlying human cognition and perception.\nCommon Conceptual Scheme\nAnother beehive corner of his philosophy is the idea of a “common conceptual scheme” by Strawson. He insisted that certain notions deeply embedded in our linguistic practice and human experiences lie at the bedrock of our understanding of reality. An analysis of such common notions will reveal to philosophers the implicit structures under which human thought and communication take place. This insight was picked up in the broader framework of ordinary language philosophy, where the importance of everyday linguistic practice was underscored.\nWhat Awards and Honors Did Strawson Receive?\nHe received high recognition for his philosophical contributions. In 1960, he was elected Fellow of the British Academy, while in 1971, he became a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He served as president of the Aristotelian Society from 1969-1970, further entrenching him into the position of a leader among philosophers. He was knighted in 1977 for his services to philosophy—an acknowledgment of his contributions to metaphysics, epistemology, and the philosophy of language.\nWho Did Strawson Marry?\nStrawson married Ann Martin, who had served with him during World War II in the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers in 1945. Together, they raised four children: Galen Strawson, a philosopher who emulated his father.\nHe spent all of his life at Oxford, which is indeed synonymous with the intellectual legacy that he left behind. He died from a brief illness on February 13, 2006. The rich body of work he left behind inspires and challenges philosophers around the world.\nGolden Years at Oxford\nThis period, starting in 1950 and going through to 1970, is often remembered as the golden age of philosophy at Oxford, of which Strawson was a member. During this period, most American scholars came to Oxford owing to its vibrancy in thought and scholarly rigor exemplified by figures like Strawson.\nThe Times of London called him the one of “unchallenged breadth,” the acuteness and power for the subject in language and metaphysics. Yet his works are a must-read for his pupils and thinkers, being paragons in philosophical insight and profundity.\n- People: An Essay in Descriptive Metaphysics (1959)\n- Spacetime entities and a classifying work.\n- The Bounds of Sense: An Essay on Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason (1966)\n- An interpretive and critical study of Immanuel Kant’s “Critique of Pure Reason,” which provides a grounding in Kantian epistemology and metaphysics.\n- Freedom and Resentment and Other Essays (1974)\n- A collection of essays on matters as diverse as moral responsibility, human freedom, and the nature of philosophical inquiry.\nEnduring Influence\nHis influence stretches far beyond his lifetime. The impact of his criticism of Russell, his development of descriptive metaphysics, and his work on the common conceptual scheme has set the course of modern philosophy. His works continue to be read and discussed in a way that reflects the timeless relevance of his ideas.",

She is perhaps best known as Sarah Jane Smith, a regular member of the cast in the British television series Doctor Who, for whom she played from 1973-1976 under both Jon Pertwee and Tom Baker, and who then over the next few decades returned many times to play the character in Doctor Who and in the spin-offs K-9 and Company (1981) and The Sarah Jane Adventures (2007-2011).\nWhere has Elisabeth Sladen lived?\nElizabeth has lived in Liverpool.\nDid Tom Baker get along with Elisabeth Sladen?\nThey did wonderful work on Who and After, but beyond that, they were great friends; Tom even gave a poignant tribute to Elizabeth on his website after her death.\nEarly life\nElizabeth was born 1 February 1946 in Liverpool, England. Sladen was the child of Tom Sladen (1900-1994), who served during the First World War and Home Guard during the Second World War, and Gladys (1902-1978) (née Trainer).\nShe took up acting as a child, was taught to dance at five, and appeared in one production with the Royal Ballet. She was a contemporary at the primary school of future politician Edwina Currie, appearing in at least one school production with her. Her secondary education was at Aigburth Vale High School.\nSarah Jane Smith\nIn 1973, the departing actress who played assistant to Jon Pertwee and the Third Doctor was Jo Grant; producer of Z-Cars, Ron Craddock, was “very enthusiastic in recommending the actress to his friend and BBC producer of Doctor Who, Barry Letts. Sladen was unaware at the time what she was doing when auditioning for the new role of companion in Doctor Who or how thoroughly meticulous Letts is.\nShe also met Pertwee, whom at the time she would find intimidating. As she joked with Letts and Pertwee, each time she turned to glance at one of them, the other would give her a thumbs-up. The role of Sarah Jane Smith was originally intended for comic actress April Walker, but allegedly during rehearsals for her debut story, The Time Warrior, misgivings about the casting of Walker and Pertwee arose, and the part was instead given to Sladen. In 1981, a new Doctor Who producer called John Nathan-Turner was ringing her as part of attempting to ease over from Tom Baker into the newly appointed Doctor, Peter Davison.\nIn How Many Shows Did Sladen Play Sarah Jane?\nTwo were BBC Radio productions, The Paradise of Death (Radio 5, 1993) and The Ghosts of N-Space (Radio 2, 1996), with Jon Pertwee and Nicholas Courtney. In 1997, Sladen was voted Hall of Fame Actress in the Cult TV Awards. Big Finish Productions has produced two series of Sarah Jane Smith audio adventures set in the present day, released in 2006 and 2002. Her husband, Brian Miller, appeared in the story Ghost Town. Her daughter Sadie appeared in the audio. Sladen also contributed interviews and DVD commentaries to many of the classic Doctor Who serials she co-starred in. After the revival success of Doctor Who in 2005, Sladen guested for Sarah Jane in “School Reunion,” an episode in the 2006 series of Doctor Who opposite David Tennant as the Tenth Doctor.\nThe series won a Royal Television Society award for Best Children’s Drama in 2010. Sladen also made original audio plays on CD for The Sarah Jane Adventures, which were released in November 2007: The Glittering Storm and The Thirteenth Stone. This was the first time that BBC Audiobooks had commissioned new content for exclusive release on audio. Further pairs of audio stories were released every year until 2010, all read again by Sladen. Sladen was brought back into the series for the show’s fourth series in the final episodes “The Stolen Earth” and “Journey’s End” and was included in the title sequence of both.\nWhen Did Elisabeth Shot Her Last Scene in Doctor Who?\nHer last scene in Doctor Who was shot in the closing part of “The End of Time,” the final episode in which Tennant played the Tenth Doctor. Shortly before her death, Sladen had also been keen to feature in the Doctor Who Fourth Doctor Big Finish series.\nWhy is Last Mission Popular?\nIn 1991, she portrayed Alexa opposite Colin Baker in the BBV Audio Adventure The Last Mission. Sladen appeared in Kate Orman’s Bernice Summerfield audio drama Walking to Babylon. After completing filming The Paradise of Death in 1993, Sladen returned to private life behind the camera in the United Kingdom. In 1995, she played Dr. Pat Hewland in four episodes of the ITV drama series Peak Practice. In 1996, she played Sophie in Faith in the Future, and she went on to appear in 15 episodes of the BBC schools program Number Time, which ran annually for nearly ten years. It was her final television acting appearance until the 2006 Doctor Who episode “School Reunion.”.\nAutobiography\nAutobiography Elisabeth Sladen: The Autobiography was published posthumously on 7 November 2011 by Aurum Press Ltd. The book was launched at ‘The Doctor Who Experience’, Kensington Olympia, on November 26, 2011, in the presence of Brian Miller, Sadie Miller, Tom Baker, and Terrance Dicks.\nThe BBC released an audio CD version of the book, narrated by fellow Doctor Who alumna Caroline John, on 1 December 2011. The book has been introduced to readers with a foreword by fellow Doctor Who actor David Tennant, who played the Tenth Doctor.\nPersonal Life\nPersonal life Sladen married actor Brian Miller on 8 June 1968 in Liverpool.

Born at Catton, near Norwich, England, Lindley developed knowledge about plants, especially orchids, which contributed to a new understanding in the field of classification, thereby gaining him numerous accolades and honors throughout the years of his life.\nHis interest in plants, natural systems, and education made him a great personality in the botanical world. The following biography delves into his early years, career, and what he has achieved in botany that has left an indelible mark in history.\nEarly Years\nJohn Lindley was born on February 5, 1799, in Catton, near Norwich, England, to George and Mary Lindley. He had a father who was a nurseryman and pomologist with a commercial nursery garden. Although George knew horticulture, he did not have skills in finance; therefore, George left the family in debt.\nThere were four children, and he was the middle child. The boy spent time helping in the garden and picking wildflowers across the Norfolk countryside. He had developed an interest in plants and natural history from an early age.\nLindley was educated at Norwich School. He had always aspired to attend university or join the army, but due to his background, he had very few options. In 1815, he became the agent for a London seed merchant, which brought him closer to opportunities in botany. He was initiated by some of the most important botanists of that period, such as William Jackson Hooker and Sir Joseph Banks. Later, in his career, these two came to be helpful to him for various reasons.\nEarly Career and Influences\nIn 1819, Lindley published his first work, translating “Analyse du fruit” by L. C. M. Richard. His original works were “Monographia Rosarum” in 1820 and “Monographia Digitalium” in 1821, both of which appeared in the Linnean Society journal. In these publications, he established himself as an up-and-coming botanist with a very keen eye for detail and an outstanding ability to describe new plant species.\nIn 1822, Lindley was appointed assistant secretary to the Royal Horticultural Society and played an important role in supervising its new garden at Chiswick. That established him as one of Britain’s most prominent botanists. His efforts to further horticulture and botany were appropriately rewarded. In that year he married Sarah Freestone; she was to prove his true daily life partner for scientific research over the rest of his life.\nWho was John Lindley?\nLindley never lost his love for Orchidaceae. His monographs and drawings were very detailed and had much to contribute to the scientific knowledge of orchids. The climax of his work was in “Collectanea Botanica” (1821-1826)—a folio work with colored illustrations, many of which were painted by Lindley himself. This passion for orchids earned him immense respect and admiration that cemented his reputation as the preeminent authority on the classification of orchids.\nIn 1829, he became the lecturer of botany at University College, London. He held that position until 1860 when he lectured thousands. In the course of his duties, he contributed greatly to the world through his lectures at the Royal Institution and the Chelsea Physic Garden. His lectures at those institutions were described as fantastic and intellectually enlivening, and such descriptions enhanced his reputation as one of the finest botanists and a respected educator.\nContribution and Classification by Botanically in Orchidology\nHe did much regarding botanical classification, especially from orchids and their taxonomy as well. His works, such as “The Genera and Species of Orchidaceous Plants,” exhibited Lindley’s intimate knowledge of plant taxonomy and classification. In 1883, Bentham and Hooker listed more than 100 genera that were named and described by Lindley; in 1889, Pfitzer accepted 127.\nDue to his scientific thoroughness and natural classification method, botanists could classify plants in a more meaningful way based on the relationships in nature rather than artificial combinations. Contributions to botany and horticulture by John Lindley are monumentally monumental in the world’s history. Much of his rigorous work in plant classification, dedication to this, and encouraging natural systems for taxonomy have given him the face that botany shows today.\nLindley was a prolific writer and editor. He wrote significantly for the Botanical Register and The Gardeners’ Chronicle. He was the editor of the horticultural section of this journal from 1841. His passion for education was so strong that he wrote botanical textbooks to meet his students’ demands since they were not as well-stocked as they are today.\nScientific Recognition and Honors\nHe accepted his contributions to botany. In 1828, he was made a Fellow of the Royal Society and, in 1857, was rewarded with the Royal Medal. He was, in the same period, elected a corresponding member of the Institut de France in 1853 and, as well, became a fellow of the American Philosophical Society in 1862. As such, his potential and influence in botany attracted him to honorary memberships by scientific bodies worldwide.\nIn 1845, Lindley was part of a scientific commission that sought to determine the cause of potato blight in the Irish famine. He was not able to identify the fungal disease, but his report opened the way for the repeal of the Corn Laws of 1815, allowing cheap American wheat to flood the country and reduce the effects of the famine on Irish society.\nLater Years and Legacy\nIn 1861, Lindley took charge of the organization of exhibits for the International Exhibition at South Kensington. His health began to decline due to overwork. His memory started to fail him, and he resigned his university professorship in 1863. Two years later, he relinquished his post as Secretary to the Royal Horticultural Society.\nWhen did John Lindley die?\nHe was still a giant even in his last days. He died on 1 November 1865 at his Acton Green residence near London. He was 66 years of age.\nWas John Lindley married?\nSurviving him was his wife, Sarah; two very gifted daughters, Sarah Lindley Crease; and a son, Nathaniel, who went on to become an eminent lawyer and a life peer.",
  "https_samehhabeeb_uk_/https_samehhabeeb_uk_people_ealing-people_colin-edward-thompson-a-journey-through-creativity-from-ealing-to-worldwide-fame/content_42.html": "Colin Edward Thompson was born on October 18, 1942, in Ealing, Middlesex—now west London—and is an English-Australian writer and illustrator of children’s books. The author has published more than 70 works to date, which have kept the hearts and minds of all his readers enthrallingly engaged with their stories and illustrations.\nHe stands out as one of the greatest figures in the world of children’s literature because of his whimsical, colorful pictures and thought-provoking storytelling. Thompson’s work spans from picture books to young adult fiction across many years but inspires children all over the world.\nWho is Colin Thompson?\nColin Thompson remains the case in point for all writers and illustrators: a case that embodies creativity and a persevering ability to weave powerful stories that take hearts on great journeys. He remains the ultimate representation of those of the great authors of children’s books. And through his creation, Thompson still inspires future generations to dream limitless possibilities of words and texts into reality.\nChildhood Life and Background\nMost of Colin Thompson’s years were in childhood and formed most of his early artistic and writer development. He had been schooled in a Yorkshire boarding school as well as West London grammar school. Still, it is that period that gave him time in his childhood that defined what defined his profession afterward—art and telling stories.\nIn 1953, when his mother remarried, Thompson’s official surname was decreed to be that of Thompson—an important juncture in his personal life. Though the biological father remained a remote figure in his life, much of his work is full of reflection on his childhood and how it has shaped both his imagination as well as hardiness.\nAfter leaving school, he took up several jobs. First, he was a silk-screen printer and graphic designer, then went to train as a filmmaker at the London Film School. He refined his visual narrative art here by making documentaries for the BBC and gaining excellent experience in visual narratives.\nCareer Break into Writing and Illustration\nColin Thompson started his foray into children’s literature quite late in life. Black-and-white illustrations he submitted in 1990 to a publisher were expected to go along with a written story, so he was challenged to provide the story and redo his black-and-white artwork in color. Thereafter came the publication in 1991 of his first picture book, Ethel the Chicken.\nThe development led Thompson to a rich life of a career as an illustrator and an author. The beautiful style incorporates intense, whiz-bang images with emotive, imagination-inspired stories. Characters who go out for adventure also learn tough lessons, even existential dilemmas, all couched within rich storytelling.\nWorks and Style in the Arts\nThis mix of storytelling with imaginative art has become his distinguishing aspect in an incredibly crowded world of literature.\nThe works of Thompson are extremely diverse, such as picture books, novels for young adults, poetry, and collaborative storytelling. His illustrations are very colorful surreal landscapes and humorous yet thought-provoking imagery. His ability to blend fantastical elements with realistic narratives allows readers to fully immerse themselves in his whimsical worlds.\nWhat Are The Most Notable Works Of Colin Thomson?\n- Ethel the Chicken (1991): A funny story of a chicken who wants to be an artist in a world outside of chickendom; for kids to dream up the extraordinary.\n- How to Live Forever (1996): A novel on aging, on the philosophy of immortality. Whimsy with the profundity of the human condition.\n- The Short and Incredibly Happy Life of Riley, 2006 This poignant dog story about a short but happy life brought Thompson into the public eye and earned her even a Children’s Book Council of Australia award.\nThe collaborative works of Thompson reflect his talent in storytelling with other artists. Some books that celebrate the combination of lively illustrations and exciting storytelling are The Puzzle Duck by Emma Quay and The Staircase Cat by Anna Pignataro.\nHas Colin Thompson won any awards?\nColin Thompson has won many awards for his contribution to children’s literature throughout his career. The first major recognition came in 1995, when Ruby won the English 4–11 Picture Book Award by the English Association. His works have consistently been acknowledged since then in several prestigious literary awards.\n- Children’s Book Council of Australia (CBCA): Thompson has been shortlisted several times and also won this same award five times. His novels are the prize-winning novel 2006 in The Short and Incredibly Happy Life of Riley.\n- Aurealis Award: His work How to Live Forever won him the Best Children’s Long Fiction in 2004.\n- International Board on Books for Young People (IBBY): Work in visual storytelling led Thompson onto the honor list in 2002 for Falling Angels.\n- Outside of individual award-winning work, the creative output by Thompson will continue to motivate and inspire future generations of both readers and writers.\nWhat are some fun facts about Colin Thompson?\nThe works of Colin Thompson are far from traditional children’s books. His works in poetry and young adult fiction exhibit his versatility as a storyteller. His poetry books, The Dog’s Been Sick in the Honda and My Brother Drinks out of the Toilet, weave in humor with personal reflection, making them deal with real-life themes with a lighthearted edge of irreverence.\nHis books for the young adult audience, such as The Floods and The Dragons, still hold within them that fantasy and imagination his works were noted for, but now with far more mature themes explored. He has written varied themes of family dynamics, adventure, and self-discovery, speaking about the scope as an author.\nThe works of Colin Thompson transcend his pieces. His stories are so fascinating, educative, and entertaining that readers, educators, and fellow writers remember him forever. His unique style has encouraged a lot of readers to adopt creativity and originality, and people now realize that imagination knows no bounds.\nFrom Ealing to literary stardom, the journey of Thompson reflectively indicates a man determined for his craft in writing. His works keep on striking chords among readers, an often miscellaneous mix of fantasy and reality in ways that thrill, provoke, and delight readers of all ages.",

  "https_samehhabeeb_uk_/https_samehhabeeb_uk_people_ealing-people_charles-hamilton-the-prolific-author-from-ealing-who-defined-boys-adventure-stories/content_91.html": "Charles Hamilton (8 August 1876–24 December 1961) was a prolific author of the English literary world, publishing many books. He was highly sought after for writing boys’ fiction. It was the fact that the most popular stories of Hamilton were in the form of series, and it was due to the use of repeated characters throughout his series that it became so.\nSome of the most famous contributions by Charles Harold St. John Hamilton were school stories set in public schools. He wrote under many pseudonyms, and the astonishing volume of work he produced established him irrevocably as the world’s most prolific author.\nEarly Life and Entry into the Literary Profession\nBorn in Ealing, London, Hamilton was the son of John Hamilton, a master carpenter, and Mary Ann Hannah. As he was privately tutored at Thorn House School, he excelled in Greek from classical studies, and this early exposure to literature and languages prepared him to be a writer.\nHamilton’s writing career started in 1895. The first of his stories was taken directly from the manuscript and published, but that did not stop this writer’s unrivaled career. Thereafter, he directed his pen to stories from Trapps Holmes; that man published thousands of school stories written by Hamilton as well as a few thousand pieces of detective tales and Westerns.\nHeyday of Hamilton, 1907-1940\nThe Gem was published by Amalgamated Press in 1907, with stories about St. Jim’s school from Hamilton. Writing under the pen name Martin Clifford, Hamilton introduced readers to Tom Merry and an ecstatic range of characters. The series was an instant success, paving the way for another school series, The Magnet, launched in 1908. For the Magnet series, Hamilton used the pen name Frank Richards and created Greyfriars School and the unforgettable Billy Bunter. Heyday of Hamilton was one of the most popular writings of Charles.\nGreyfriars: The World of Billy Bunter\nHamilton’s stories for The Magnet were a cultural phenomenon. Billy Bunter, the “fat owl of the Remove,” became a household name. Bunter’s antics, motivated by laziness, greed, and dishonesty, provide comic relief while standing in sharp contrast to the moral virtues embodied by the other characters. His good nature and haplessness made him endearing despite his flaws.\nHamilton’s genius was reflected in a microcosm of public school life, from rivalries to friendships and adventure. There were core groupings and others, and The Famous Five stood out with Harry Wharton, Bob Cherry, Frank Nugent, Johnny Bull, and Hurree Singh. One lived through the pages vicariously.\nDecline of the Weekly Papers\nBoth The Magnet and The Gem were witnessing decreasing circulation by the late 1930s due to growing competition, which included other competitor papers and shifting interests of readers. In 1939, The Gem merged with another paper, and in 1940, The Magnet folded because there was a shortage of wartime paper.\nAfter The Magnet had run its course, Hamilton suffered a period of relatively low productivity. However, in 1946, he signed up with Charles Skilton, and in this way revived the Greyfriars series in hardback format. The new book, Billy Bunter of Greyfriars School, was a new series that ran right through to the death of its creator. He also scripted seven Billy Bunter series for the BBC, which made a mark in the writing world. This introduced his characters to an entirely new readership.\nWhere Did Charles Hamilton Live?\nHamilton led a very private life. Writing and intellectual activity were the center of his interests. Classical languages, chess, music, and gambling, especially the latter often appearing in the stories as warnings, interested him.\nHe lived in a small house called Rose Lawn in Kent, with a housekeeper to look after him. Although Hamilton was reclusive, he corresponded vigorously with his readers to maintain an element of lively intercourse with his public.\nA Legacy of Prolific Output\nHamilton’s literary works were simply unmatched. Researchers estimate that he wrote approximately 100 million words during his lifetime, the same as 1,200 novels. His work ranged through more than 100 fictional schools of education, hundreds of non-school stories, and many genres. Because Hamilton used more than 25 identified pen names, it became possible to create different worlds and maintain an astronomical rate of publication.\nStyle and Themes\nThe writing style of Hamilton is light-hearted and humorous in tone, yet within it lies a hidden moral undertone. His stories are often laced with virtues such as honesty, generosity, and sportsmanship, but also critique vices like gambling and dishonesty.\nInclusivity and Limitations\nThe writer created characters from every walk of society. Hurree Singh was an Indian schoolboy while Monty Newland was a Jewish pupil. Thereby he set up an elite Britain with British and Victorian values to deflate the prevalent racist prejudices. For his African race, though there were some interesting characters, stereotype-bound characters continued the trend of prejudices prevailing then.\nThe Charm of Billy Bunter\nBilly Bunter is the humor in Hamilton’s writing. This is because of his constant intrusion into the school life of seriousness. He acts as a foil for the moral standards expressed by the other boys. Time, for his botched adventures, stands still.\nWhat was Charles Hamilton famous for?\nHamilton’s great production placed him in the Guinness Book of Records. His ability to pen interesting, high-standard stories for decades measures his natural talent as well as his strict work ethic.\nEven to this day, many decades after he was dead and gone, the stories Hamilton wrote are just as entertaining and inspiring as they were when he first penned them. The Greyfriars saga, especially, is a most precious jewel of English literary heritage, capturing the timelessness of adventure, friendship, and humor.\nThe life and work of Charles Harold St. John Hamilton prove that storytelling makes a difference. He has written his name in indelible ink on the pages of literature with his unbelievable creativity and labor, and generations to come will respect his characters and stories.",

She married the poet George Gordon Byron, more commonly known as Lord Byron, and separated from him after less than a year, taking their daughter Ada Lovelace with her and refusing to hand her over despite laws at the time giving fathers sole custody of children.\nEarly Life\nLady Byron was born Anne Isabella Milbanke, the only child of Sir Ralph Milbanke, 6th Baronet, and his wife, the Hon. Judith Noel (1751-1822), sister of Thomas Noel, Viscount Wentworth. Her father’s only surviving sibling was Elizabeth Lamb, Viscountess Melbourne, the influential political hostess. Her mother’s only surviving sibling had no legitimate heirs, but he did have one son before his marriage, named after him, Thomas Noel; he became a clergyman. When Anne’s maternal uncle died, a few months after her marriage to Lord Byron, Lady Milbanke and her cousin Lord Scarsdale jointly inherited his estate. The family subsequently took the surname Noel over Milbanke.\nWho was the wife of Lord Byron?\nAnnabella Milbanke married Byron in January 1815. Ada, born toward the end of their first turbulent year as a married couple, was only a few weeks old when Lady Byron removed both herself and her baby daughter from the marital home on Piccadilly Terrace in January 1816.\nWhat is Lady Byron known for?\nAnne Isabella Noel Byron, 11th Baroness Wentworth and Baroness Byron (née Milbanke; 17 May 1792–16 May 1860), nicknamed Annabella and commonly known as Lady Byron, was an educational reformer and philanthropist who established the first industrial school in England and was an active abolitionist.\nPopularity\nByron’s popularity was soaring following the success of his work Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage. Annabella met him on many social occasions as he began a relationship with Lady Caroline Lamb, the wife of her cousin, William Lamb. However, Byron was drawn to her modesty and intellect, and in October 1812 he proposed marriage through her aunt, the well-connected political hostess Elizabeth Lamb, Viscountess Melbourne. In reply, she penned a synopsis of his character, and three days later rejected him. However, they were beset with a stubborn interest in each other.\nAlthough well aware of Byron’s shortcomings, telling her mother, “He is a very bad, very good man,” she decided it was her religious obligation to support him and improve his behaviour. In August 1813, she contacted him in writing for the first time. The letters continued into the following year; some expressed assurances and comfort for him when opinion was against him, while others described her as having a very imperfect attachment towards him. By this time, he had accepted an invitation from Sir Ralph Milbanke to come to Seaham Hall, a family seat at County Durham, to get away from her pressures.\nMarriage\nWhen George Gordon Byron approached her a second time, in September 1814, she was willing to give in. Again, the union was private and by special license and took place at Seaham Hall in County Durham on January 2, 1815; the officiating clergyman, her cousin and illegitimate child of her uncle, Viscount Wentworth, was the Rev. Thomas Noel of Kirkby Mallory, and the union was at their London residence, Piccadilly Terrace.\nNow Byron was as much in fiscal straits. He refused the sums tendered to him for his compositions since the business was an unworthy occupation for a gentleman and granted copyrights to those who assisted him. He was not having an easy time selling Newstead Abbey and Rochdale, with which to pay off the loan.\nHe turned his animosity and malice on his wife in the late summer of 1815. His mood was morbid, and he took to drink. To his half-sister, Augusta Leigh, he wrote that he had reason to suspect that his wife had unlocked his desk and searched it. In the latter half of that year, he had begun an affair with Susan Boyce, a London actress at Drury Lane Theatre, where he was a director.\nEducational reformist and abolitionist\nLady Byron is on the far right of this painting of the 1840 World Anti-Slavery Convention. She committed herself to social causes, such as prison reform and the abolition of slavery. In furtherance of the latter, Lady Byron attended the 1840 World Anti-Slavery Convention, where she was one of the few women included in its commemorative painting. Lady Byron lived in Ealing between around 1822 and 1840 and established Ealing Grove School.\nHow did Lord Byron die?\nThe pathological conditions surrounding Byron’s death were the primary problem, namely malaria. Lord Byron died in the Greek War of Independence against the Ottoman Empire at Messolonghi on 19 April 1824.\nLater life\nAnnabella wrote to Byron during her first month away from him, affectionately addressing him as “dearest Duck.” Meanwhile, she and her parents consulted lawyers. Their attorney advised them to obtain a legal separation and sent a letter to Byron suggesting the separation. Augusta Leigh, who had stayed with Byron at Piccadilly Terrace since his wife left, intercepted the letter because she feared he would commit suicide if he knew of it.\nShe returned the letter to Kirkby Mallory and made known her view that the circumstances of marriage with the Byrons required a good deal more consideration than it had had up to now. A week later, though, a messenger dispatched back to the House sent the proposal to Lord Byron himself.\nHow Did Lady Byron Die?\nLady Byron died of breast cancer on 16 May 1860, the day before she was to turn 68. She was interred in Kensal Green Cemetery at Kensal Green in London. Before her death, she had related the history of her marriage to Byron to Harriet Beecher Stowe, who urged her to keep silent. In 1869, Stowe published the account given to her, the first time anyone had publicly hinted at an incestuous relationship between Byron and his half-sister.",

  "https_samehhabeeb_uk_/https_samehhabeeb_uk_people_ealing-people_frank-richards-the-prolific-writer-from-ealing-who-shaped-various-stories/content_50.html": "Frank Richards (8 August 1876 – 24 December 1961) was an English writer, best known for a long-running series of stories for weekly magazines about recurrent casts of characters. His most frequent and famous genre was boys’ public school stories, though he also wrote in other genres. He also wrote hundreds of stories under his real name, such as the Ken King stories for The Modern Boy.\nWhy is Frank Richards featured in the Guinness Book of Records?\nFrank Richards is estimated to have written about 100 million words in his lifetime and has been featured in the Guinness Book of Records as the world’s most prolific author.\nWhat is the real name of Frank Richards?\nThe real name of Frank Richards is Charles Hamilton.\nWhat are some of the pen names Frank Richards used?\nCharles Hamilton wrote under several pen names, usually adopting a different name for each group of characters he wrote about, the best known being Frank Richards for the Greyfriars School stories that featured Billy Bunter. Other important pen names were Martin Clifford for St. Jim’s, Owen Conquest for Rookwood, and Ralph Redway for The Rio Kid.\nEarly life\nHamilton was born in Ealing, London, one of the eight children of Mary Ann Hannah and John Hamilton (1839-1884), a master carpenter. Charles Hamilton was privately educated at Thorn House School in Ealing, where he studied classical Greek among other subjects. He then went on to become a fiction writer, and his first story was accepted almost immediately and appeared in 1895.\nStart of Career\nOver the following years, he was to establish himself as the main writer with the publisher Trapps Holmes, providing several thousand stories on a range of subjects, including police, detectives, firemen, Westerns, as well as school stories. In 1906 he started to write for the Amalgamated Press, and although he continued to have stories published for Trapps Holmes until 1915 (many of which were reprints), his allegiance was gradually moved.\nLater career (1940–1961)\nWhen The Magnet was eventually closed in 1940, Hamilton was hard put to obtain work. A newspaper interview that he gave the London Evening Standard helped establish his name as that of the creator of the stories. He couldn’t, of course, pick up where The Magnet had ended the Greyfriars saga because Amalgamated Press retained the rights and would not give them back. He was forced to establish new schools like Carcroft and Sparshott, and he even attempted the romance genre under the pseudonym Winston Cardew.\nBy 1946, Richards had been given permission to write Greyfriars stories again and obtained a contract from publisher Charles Skilton for a hardback series, the first volume of which, Billy Bunter of Greyfriars School, was published in September 1947. The series continued for the rest of his life, the publisher later changing to Cassells. He wrote additional stories for St. Jim’s, Rookwood, and Cliff House in addition to seven series of Billy Bunter television scripts for the BBC.\nHeyday (1907–1940)\nIn 1907, Amalgamated Press launched a story paper for boys called The Gem. The contents of its No. 11 were established, with major content forming part of the work being a serialized story based upon St. Jim’s school starring Tom Merry, authored by Charles Hamilton under his popular pen name, Martin Clifford. This series quickly became very popular, and, to ride on its coattails, a comparable enterprise was developed in 1908. This would be called The Magnet. This would focus on a school named Greyfriars, and again Hamilton would pen it, but under the pseudonym Frank Richards.\nDid Frank Richards marry?\nHamilton never married, but some details of one romance are provided in a biography, and another is briefly mentioned in his autobiography. Early in the 20th century, he was briefly engaged to a lady called Agnes, and later he formed a brief attachment to an American lady whom he alluded to as Miss New York.\nWhat Were the Interests of Frank Richards?\nHis interests were the writing of stories, the study of Latin, Greek, and modern languages, chess, music, and gambling at Monte Carlo, particularly. Horace, the Roman poet, was one of his favorite writers. He had traveled much throughout Europe during his youth but never went out of England after 1926 except to visit France. He stayed in a small house known as Rose Lawn at Kingsgate, a hamlet in St Peter parish, now a part of Broadstairs, Kent, where he was cared for by a housekeeper, Miss Edith Hood. She remained at Rose Lawn after his death.\nWhat was Frank Richard’s writing style like?\nHe used a facetious voice, strewn with witty classical allusions that ended up making the tales simultaneously intelligible and learned. In this regard, he has been compared to P. G. Wodehouse, who also came from a similar era and was an extremely prolific writer in a genre that was not too serious. His phenomenal productivity has been put down to a very flowing style that seemed to come naturally to him and in turn made the stories very readable [19], at the same time being a bit verbose.\nWhy is Frank Richards popular?\nMuch of his popularity derives from his ability to allow the reader to participate vicariously in the ongoing adventure. As with many later children’s writers, the stories center on a small core group of characters who form a close-knit unit—at St. Jim’s there was the Terrible Three, at Rookwood the Fistical Four, and at Greyfriars, the Famous Five. Such groups, though closed to other pupils, are implicitly open to readers who are subliminally invited to include themselves amongst their number, thereby establishing their involvement with the story.\nCriticism\nBefore World War II, all of Hamilton’s writing was for weekly papers, produced on cheap paper and lacking any suggestion of permanence; it had nonetheless attracted a loyal following but, unsurprisingly, no critical attention from the mainstream media. However, in 1940, a privately printed publication called the Story Paper Collector emerged.\nIt was printed at irregular times in Canada until 1966, when the founder, originally from Croydon, England, died. Distributed around the world, it contained critical discussions and articles about the work of Charles Hamilton and other storypaper writers. In November 1946, another magazine, the Collectors’ Digest, began. Created by Herbert Leckenby, and in due course edited by Eric Fayne and Mary Cadogan.",

He used his full name in his engineering career and Nevil Shute as his pen name to guard his engineering career from inferences by his employers (Vickers) or by fellow engineers that he was “not a serious person” or from potentially adverse publicity in connection with his novels, which included On the Beach and A Town Like Alice.\nWhere did Nevil Shute live?\nShute was born in Somerset Road, Ealing (then in Middlesex), in the house described in his novel Trustee from the Toolroom. He was educated at the Dragon School, Shrewsbury School, and Balliol College, Oxford; he graduated from Oxford in 1922 with a third-class degree in engineering science.\nEarly Life and Family\nShute was the son of Arthur Hamilton Norway, head of the Post Office in Ireland before the First World War, based at the General Post Office, Dublin, at the time of the Easter Rising in 1916, and his wife Mary Louisa Gadsden. Shute himself was later commended for his services as a stretcher-bearer during the rising. His grandmother, Georgina Norway, was a novelist.\nShute was trained as a gunner at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, and he attended there. During the First World War, Shute was a passed-over man for a commission in the Royal Flying Corps, having been informed that he had a stammer and the RFC could not have men who stammered.\nAugust 1918 saw him enlist as a private soldier in the ranks of the Suffolk Regiment, during which he guarded the Isle of Grain in the Thames Estuary and attended military funeral parties in Kent with other soldiers during the 1918 flu pandemic.\nAviation Career\nAn aeronautical engineer besides becoming a pilot, Shute started his engineering career with de Havilland Aircraft Company. He wrote under the pen name as an author to keep his engineering career clear from any negative publicity relating to his novels.\nHe soon became frustrated with the lack of opportunities for advancement and joined Vickers Ltd. in 1924, working on airships as Chief Calculator (stress engineer) on the R100 airship project for the Vickers subsidiary Airship Guarantee Company. In 1929, he was promoted to deputy chief engineer of the R100 project under Barnes Wallis. When Wallis left the project, Shute became the chief engineer.\nThe R100 was a prototype for passenger-carrying airships that would serve the needs of Britain’s empire. The government-funded but privately developed R100 completed a 1930 round trip to Canada. While in Canada, it made trips from Montreal to Ottawa, Toronto, and Niagara Falls. The fatal 1930 crash near Beauvais, France, of its government-developed counterpart R101 ended British interest in dirigibles. The R100 was immediately grounded and subsequently scrapped.\nHow did Nevil Shute’s engineering background influence his role during the Second World War?\nBy the start of the Second World War, Shute was an up-and-coming novelist. Even as war looked inevitable, he was working on military projects with his former boss at Vickers, Sir Dennistoun Burney. He was commissioned into the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve as a sub-lieutenant, having joined as an “elderly yachtsman” and expected to be in charge of a drifter or minesweeper, but after two days he was asked about his career and technical experience.\nHe achieved the “dizzy rank” of lieutenant commander, knowing nothing about “Sunday Divisions” and secretly fearing when he went on a little ship that he would be the senior naval officer and “have to do something.”.\nSo he ended up in the Directorate of Miscellaneous Weapons Development. There he was a head of engineering, working on secret weapons such as Panjandrum, a job that appealed to the engineer in him. He also developed the Rocket Spear, an anti-submarine missile with a fluted cast iron head.\nLiterary Career\nShute’s first novel, Stephen Morris, was written in 1923 but not published until 1961 (with its 1924 sequel, Pilotage). His first published novel was Marazan, which came out in 1926. He published a novel every other year through the 1950s, then stopped for six years when he started his company, Airspeed Ltd., specializing in aircraft construction.\nHis popularity grew steadily after each book sold, but considerably more with On the Beach, which he published for the third book from the last in 1957.\nThe style of Shute’s novels is unpretentiously simple and highly readable. The lines of the plot are easily defined. If there is any romantic element to the story, sex is rarely referred to in direct terms. Many of the stories are preceded by a narrator who is not a character in the story itself.\nThe most persistent theme in Shute’s novels is the dignity of work, from the Spanish bar hostess in the Balkans (Ruined City) to the brilliant but unworldly boffin (No Highway). His novels can be divided into three main categories: early pre-war flying adventures; Second World War stories; and Australian stories.\nAwards and Honors\nBoth Norway Road and Nevil Shute Road at Portsmouth Airport, Hampshire, were named after him. Shute Avenue in Berwick, Victoria, was named after him when the farm used for filming the 1959 film On the Beach was subdivided for housing. The public library in Alice Springs, Northern Territory, is the Nevil Shute Memorial Library. In the Readers’ List of the Modern Library 100 Best Novels of the 20th Century, A Town Like Alice came in at number 17, Trustee from the Toolroom at 27, and On the Beach at 56.\nWorks\n- Stephen Morris (1923, published 1961, ISBN 1-84232-297-4 with Pilotage). A young pilot accepts a mission that is ambitious and risky.\n- Pilotage (1924, published 1961): continuation of Stephen Morris.\n- Marazan, 1926, ISBN 1-84232-265-6. Prisoner rescues pilot whose aircraft crashes; he helps the prisoner bring down narcotics syndicate.\n- So Disdained (1928), ISBN 1-84232-294-X. Published in the U.S. as The Mysterious Aviator, and written soon after the General Strike of 1926, it reflected the debate in British society about socialism.\n- Lonely Road (1932) In this novel, there are conspiracies and counter-conspiracies, and it is an experiment in writing styles.",

  "https_samehhabeeb_uk_/https_samehhabeeb_uk_people_ealing-people_osmond-barnes/content_125.html": "Colonel Osmond Barnes CB (23 December 1834–20 May 1930) was a British officer of the Indian Army and Chief Herald of India. Barnes was a civil servant whose career showcased the imperial ethos of his time, combining a commitment to administration with a shrewd appreciation of Indian society and politics. Osmond Barnes represents both the achievement and the crisis of colonial administration achievements in administration and the failures to govern an empire in a diverse and garrulous land. His life throws some light on how the British Raj functioned and its long-term influence on modern Indian administration.\nEarly Life and Career\nOsmond Barnes, born in England, sought educational preparation in British civil service, but of early life remains sketchier, although an entry into ICS marked a distinguished career that led to such greatness. In reality, ICS was thought to be the mainstay of the British Administration of India to translate the wishes of the Crown to practical fruition.\nHis parents, John Barnes and Sarah Medley, married on 21 July 1824 and had eleven children, Edmund John, Augusta, Sarah, Lucy Antoinette, Charles Augustus, Edward Medley, John Henry, Osmond, Harold, Ada Mary, and Jocelyn.\nAn obituary of Osmond Barnes notes that when he was born, his father, John Barnes, was a high sheriff. However, The Gentleman’s Magazine and the Annual Register record that John Barnes of Chorley Wood House was appointed High Sheriff of Buckinghamshire in the year 1844. Chorleywood, although in Hertfordshire, is close to its boundary with Buckinghamshire.\nIn 1831, in reporting the early death of Barnes’s sister Augusta at the age of five, The Gentleman’s Magazine described their father as “John Barnes, Esq., banker, Farringdon, and of Chorley Wood House.”\nChallenges and Criticisms\nDespite his administrative acumen, Barnes’s career, like that of many colonial officers, was not without controversy. Imperial interest was behind the British model of governance in India, to the detriment of local populations often. Land revenue policies and reforms on urbanization led to Indians frequently grumbling and feeling the pressure of colonialism. Representing the colonial administration, Barnes drew flak over these systemic ills, yet as a private individual, he was considered fair and square.\nMilitary service\nIn 1855, Barnes joined the Indian Army and remained in service from the Indian Mutiny of 1857 to 1859. When he married in August 1862, he was “Lieut. Bombay Staff Corps and Commandant of the Lahore Light Horse.\nBarnes was gazetted a lieutenant of the 13th Native Infantry in 1863 and took part in active service during Abyssinia in 1868 and the Afghan War of 1878–1879, wherein he was mentioned in dispatches. He was promoted to captain on 5 March 1867.\nHe gazetted a Captain of the Bengal Staff Corps on 14 November 1871, promoted to Major on 5 March 1875, and ranked as Major from 4 March 1875. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel in the Bengal Staff Corps on 4 March 1881. He took part in the Zhob Valley Campaign of 1884, again being mentioned in dispatches. He was promoted to Colonel in the Bengal Staff Corps on 4 March 1885. He commanded the 10th Bengal Lancers.\nChief Herald\nBarnes was appointed Chief Herald of India. In that office, in 1877, he had the duty of declaring Queen Victoria to be Empress of India at Delhi. A wood engraving of Barnes in The Graphic newspaper of 10 March 1877 illustrated him in tabard as Chief Herald of India. He is styled ‘Major Osmond Barnes (Tenth Bengal Cavalry).\nPrivate life\nOsmond Barnes married Emily Mainwaring, with whom he had six children: Harold, Percy, Osmond Mainwaring, Charles, Mabel, and Irene. The marriage was announced in The Gentleman’s Magazine in November 1862. Barnes retired to England and lived to be ninety-five, although his wife had died in 1912.\nHonors\nAbyssinia campaign medal, 1868\nMentioned in dispatches, 1868 and 1884\nCompanion of the Order of the Bath, 1893 Queen’s Birthday Honors\nRetirement\nBarnes retired the service on 4 March 1893, announced in the Gazette as “INDIAN STAFF CORPS Colonel Osmond Barnes is transferred to the Unemployed Supernumerary List. Dated 4 March 1893”. When appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in June 1893, he was described as “Lieutenant-Colonel and Colonel Osmond Barnes, Indian Staff Corps”. Retirement from Active Service\nAfter the retirement from active service, Osmond Barnes shifted to England, where he led a quiet life and died in 1930. His work regarding colonial administration still remains of much interest to the historians working on the British Empire and its contribution to India\nContributions and Legacy\nBarnes arrived in India at a point when the British power was consolidating and transforming after the Indian Rebellion of 1857. He served in different administrative positions all over India and often had to balance the British government’s interests with the complexity of Indian society, a role that required tact and decisiveness.\nOne of the significant contributions by Barnes was the development of municipal governance systems in colonial India. As cities grew and modernized under British rule, Barnes helped create administrative frameworks that would support urban planning, sanitation, and public order. Such frameworks formed the basis of local governance in many parts of India.\nLand revenue systems, another area of implementation, were critical to the British economy in India. The colonial focus was on extracting resources while maintaining administrative efficiency. Land revenue systems have been criticized for their exploitative nature, but as an administrator, Barnes demonstrated diligence and effort in maintaining order.",

  "https_samehhabeeb_uk_/https_samehhabeeb_uk_people_ealing-people_the-life-and-legacy-of-ada-lovelace-trailblazing-mathematician-of-ealing/content_73.html": "Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (née Byron; 10 December 1815–27 November 1852), more famously known as Ada Lovelace, was an English mathematician and writer primarily known for her work with Charles Babbage’s proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She was the first to see applications beyond pure calculation that a machine had.\nChildhood\nLord Byron expected his child to be a “glorious boy” and was disappointed when Lady Byron gave birth to a girl. The child was named after Byron’s half-sister, Augusta Leigh, and was called “Ada” by Byron himself. On 16 January 1816, at Lord Byron’s command, Lady Byron left for her parents’ home at Kirkby Mallory, taking their five-week-old daughter with her. Although English law at the time granted full custody of children to the father in cases of separation, Lord Byron did not attempt to claim his parental rights but did request that his sister keep him informed of Ada’s welfare.\nOn 21 April, Lord Byron signed the deed of separation, although very reluctantly, and left England for good a few days later. Aside from an acrimonious separation, Lady Byron continued throughout her life to make allegations about her husband’s immoral behavior. This set of events made Lovelace infamous in Victorian society. Ada did not have a relationship with her father. He died in 1824 when she was eight years old. Her mother was the only significant parental figure in her life.\nWhat is Ada Lovelace known for?\nAda Lovelace was one of the only English mathematicians and writers whom people call “the first programmer,” because she basically helped revolutionize the trajectory that the computer industry took. At the time she realized that a computer had capabilities much greater than just mathematical calculations.\nWhat is the famous quote of Ada Lovelace?\n“The more I study, the more insatiable I feel my genius for it to be.\nDid Ada Lovelace have a daughter?\nAnne Blunt, 15th Baroness Wentworth.\nWhat are 5 interesting facts about Ada Lovelace?\n-\n- Growing up, Lovelace had a remarkable nickname.\n-\n- She suffered from gambling issues.\n-\n- Lovelace and her father both died young.\n-\n- She had a legendary mentor\nSuccess in Work\nThroughout her life, Lovelace was strongly interested in scientific developments and fads of the day, including phrenology and mesmerism. After her work with Babbage, Lovelace continued to work on other projects. In 1844, she wrote to a friend, Woronzow Greig, of her wish to construct a mathematical model for how the brain gives rise to thoughts and nerves to feelings (“a calculus of the nervous system”).\nShe never achieved this, however. In part, her interest in the brain came from a long-running preoccupation, inherited from her mother, about her “potential” madness. As part of her research into this project, she visited the electrical engineer Andrew Crosse in 1844 to learn how to carry out electrical experiments.\nIn the same year, she wrote a review of a paper by Baron Karl von Reichenbach, Researches on Magnetism, but this was not published and does not appear to have progressed past the first draft. In 1851, the year before her cancer struck, she wrote to her mother mentioning “certain productions” she was working on regarding the relation of math and music.\nThe first published computer program\nIn 1840, Babbage was invited to give a seminar at the University of Turin about his Analytical Engine. Luigi Menabrea, a young Italian engineer and the future Prime Minister of Italy, transcribed Babbage’s lecture into French, and this transcript was subsequently published in the Bibliothèque universelle de Genève in October 1842. Babbage’s friend Charles Wheatstone commissioned Ada Lovelace to translate Menabrea’s paper into English. She then fleshed out the paper with notes, which she included in the translation. Ada Lovelace took the better part of a year to do this, with the aid of input from Babbage. These notes, which run much longer than Menabrea’s paper, were published under the initialism AAL in the September 1843 edition of Taylor’s Scientific Memoirs.\nObserved Commemoration\nThe computer language Ada, created on behalf of the United States Department of Defense, was named after Lovelace. The reference manual for the language was approved on 10 December 1980, and the Department of Defense Military Standard for the language, MIL-STD-1815, was given the number of the year of her birth.\nIn 1981, the Association for Women in Computing established its Ada Lovelace Award. To date, as of 1998, the British Computer Society (BCS) has granted the Lovelace Medal, and in 2008 launched an annual competition for women students. BCSWomen sponsors the Lovelace Colloquium, a conference that convenes annually for women undergraduates. Ada College is a further education college in Tottenham Hale, London, specializing in digital skills.\nFamous Novels and plays\nLovelace appears in Romulus Linney’s 1977 play Childe Byron. In Tom Stoppard’s 1993 play Arcadia, the precocious teenage genius Thomasina Coverly—a character “apparently based” on Ada Lovelace (the play also involves Lord Byron)—comes to understand chaos theory and theorizes the second law of thermodynamics before either is officially recognized.\nIn the 1990 steampunk novel The Difference Engine by William Gibson and Bruce Sterling, Lovelace addresses the “punched cards” program, which determines Gödel’s incompleteness theorems decades before their actual discovery. Lovelace and Mary Shelley as teenagers are the central characters in Jordan Stratford’s steampunk series, The Wollstonecraft Detective Agency.\nFilm and television\nIn the 1997 film Conceiving Ada, a computer scientist obsessed with Ada finds a way of communicating with her in the past using “undying information waves.”. She is Ada Augusta Byron and is portrayed by Lily Lesser in the second season of The Frankenstein Chronicles. She is employed as an “analyst” to provide the workings of a life-sized humanoid automaton, complete with brass workings that recall Babbage’s analytical engine. Her employment is said to keep her occupied until she returns to her studies in advanced mathematics.\nWhat illness did Ada Lovelace die from?\nLovelace died of uterine cancer at the age of 36 on 27 November 1852. The illness lasted for several months, during which time Annabella took control over whom Ada saw and excluded all of her friends and confidants.\nWhere is Ada Lovelace buried?\nChurch of St Mary Magdalene, Hucknall, United Kingdom. After her death, she was buried in the Byron family vault inside the Church of St. Mary Magdalene in the small English town of Hucknall at her request. Her coffin lay side by side with that of her father, who died when he was 36 years old.",
  "https_samehhabeeb_uk_/https_samehhabeeb_uk_people_ealing-people_the-legacy-of-matt-monro-ealings-beloved-ballad-singer/content_69.html": "Matt Monro (born Terence Edward Parsons; 1 December 1930–7 February 1985) was an English singer. Known as “The Man with the Golden Voice,” he performed internationally during his 30-year career and sold a reported 23 million records. AllMusic has described Monro as “one of the most underrated pop vocalists of the ’60s,” who “possessed the easiest, most perfect baritone in the business.”.\nDid Matt Monro live in Ealing?\nMatt Monro (1930–1985), a ballad singer, lived at 1 Dallas Road, Ealing, from 1974 until his death.\nWas Matt Monro ever a bus driver?\nMonro was born Terry Parsons in working-class east London and got his first real job as a bus driver. The fact that he had a good voice soon spread—especially since he occasionally sang while driving—and he made his professional debut in small clubs.\nWhy did Matt Monro change his name?\nA demo record he had made reached the ears of popular pianist Winifred Atwell, who persuaded her record label, Decca, to give him an audition. They all fell for the magic voice at Decca and took him on, bestowing on him a new name—Matt Monro, which he was later given partly for Monro’s father, whom Atwell never forgets.\nChildhood\nTerence Edward Parsons was born on 1 December 1930 in Finsbury, northeast of the City of London, to Frederick and Alice Parsons. He had three brothers—Arthur, Reg, and Harry—and a sister, Alice. He attended Duncombe School in Islington and Elliott School in Putney. Monro had an unfortunate childhood. His father died when he was three, and after his mother fell ill, his family fostered him out for two years. After leaving school at 14, he had a series of jobs without sticking at any of them for very long before National Service beckoned in 1948. Monro became an instructor in the British armed forces in the art of driving a tank and was posted to Hong Kong.\nHe had sung in public from an early age, for example, at the Tufnell Park Palais, and in Hong Kong he developed the habit of entering local talent contests, winning several. He became a regular guest—and frequent winner—of Radio Rediffusion’s Talent Time show in Hong Kong. He was invited by then-host Ray Cordeiro to perform in his own one-off show entitled Terry Parsons Sings, on condition that he would thereafter bow out of future Talent Time episodes to make way for others. Agreeing to the deal, he performed his first on-air concert for Rediffusion on 27 June 1953.\nSuccessful Career\nIn 1957, Monro released Blue and Sentimental, an album of standards. The release was well received, but Monro was stuck in the background among the young male hopefuls trying to break through in the late 1950s, many covering the Frank Sinatra-type Frankie Vaughan hits. Monro recorded a cover of Vaughan’s “Garden of Eden” during this time as well. He was signed to Fontana Records for a short recording contract.\nIn 1959, he recorded a country pastiche song, “Bound for Texas,” for The Chaplin Revue, a feature-length compilation of Charlie Chaplin shorts. It would be the first of many Monroe soundtrack themes. Monro reached the United States charts when “My Kind of Girl” (1961) and “Walk Away” (1964) hit the top 40. In 1966, following the death of Nat King Cole, EMI moved Monro from Parlophone to Capitol. The new recording contract necessitated a move to the United States.\nThis would mark the start of an LP trend, and he was now working with American arrangers such as Sid Feller and Billy May on recording albums that included “This Is the Life,” “The Late Show,” “Invitation to the Movies,” and “Invitation to Broadway.”. But, unlike “Born Free,” his other Capitol singles in California did not do well.\nRecording Several Albums\nAfter moving to California and recording several albums with American arrangers, Monro returned to the UK and stayed with George Martin. He later began to change labels within EMI to Columbia, where his final U.S. album, Close to You, was released in 1970. This LP contained “We’re Gonna Change the World,” a semi-satirical song originally used in a TV commercial for Kellogg’s Cornflakes. It was not a success in either the US or UK but remained a staple to this day across the airwaves, and the record became and remains a radio staple on BBC Radio 2.

  "https_samehhabeeb_uk_/https_samehhabeeb_uk_people_ealing-people_murray-perahia-the-legendary-pianist-and-conductor-from-ealing/content_80.html": "Murray David Perahia was born on April 19, 1947. He is an American pianist and conductor. He has been considered one of the greatest living pianists. He was the first North American pianist to win the Leeds International Piano Competition, in 1972. Known as a leading interpreter of Bach, Handel, Scarlatti, Mozart, Beethoven, and Schumann, among other composers, Perahia has won numerous awards, including three Grammy Awards from a total of 18 nominations, and 9 Gramophone Awards in addition to its first and only “Piano Award”.\nEarly life\nMurray (Moshe) was born in the Bronx borough of New York City to a family of Sephardi Jewish origin. According to the biography on his Mozart piano sonatas CD, his first language was Judaeo-Spanish or Ladino. The family came from Thessaloniki, Greece. His father moved to the United States in 1935.\nHe began taking piano lessons at age four with a teacher, he said, who was “very limiting” because she made him play a single piece until it was perfect. He said his musical interests blossomed at age 15 for reasons he can’t explain, and he began to practice seriously.\nAt age 17, Perahia attended Mannes College, where he studied keyboard, conducting, and composition with his teacher and mentor Mieczysław Horszowski. During the summer, he also attended the Marlboro Music School and Festival, where he studied with musicians Rudolf Serkin, Alexander Schneider, and Pablo Casals, among others. He played duets for piano four hands with Serkin, who later made Perahia his assistant at the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia, a position he held for over a year.\nIn 1965, Perahia won the Young Concert Artists International Auditions. In 1972, he was the first North American to win first prize at the Leeds Piano Competition, helping to cement its reputation for advancing the careers of young pianists.\nCareer\nIn 1973, Perahia worked with Benjamin Britten and Peter Pears at the Aldeburgh Festival, and with fellow pianist Radu Lupu. He was co-artistic director of the Festival from 1981 to 1989.\nIn the 1980s, Perahia was invited by Vladimir Horowitz, an admirer of his art, to work with him. Perahia says that this had a defining influence on his pianism. He became very close to Horowitz, to whom he regularly visited during his last four years to play for him.\nFrom 1973 to 2010, Perahia has recorded exclusively for Columbia Masterworks, now Sony Classical. He first recorded all of Mozart’s 27 piano concertos conducted from the keyboard with the English Chamber Orchestra. In the 1980s, he recorded Beethoven’s five piano concertos with Bernard Haitink and the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra.\nDoes Murray Perahia have any hand injuries?\nIn 1990, Perahia suffered a cut to his right thumb, which became septic. He took antibiotics for this condition, but they affected his health. In 1992, his career was threatened by a bone abnormality in his hand causing inflammation, requiring several years away from the keyboard and a series of operations. During that time, he says, he found solace through studying the music of J.S. Bach. After his recovery, he made a series of award-winning recordings of Bach’s keyboard works in the late 1990s, including a notable rendition of the Goldberg Variations.\nDuring the early months of 2005, Perahia’s hand returned to causing trouble, and it was decided in consultation with doctors that he withdraw from the concert platform. Canceled appearances for the Barbican Centre and a ten-city national tour around the United States were followed in 2006 by recitals around German cities. He returned, however, and gave recitals at the Barbican in April 2007.\nIn 2007 he completed a second ten-city American tour. Due to his hand problem, and on the advice of his doctor, Perahia canceled a February 2008 solo recital at the Barbican Centre and a tour in the United States with the Academy of St Martin in the Fields (March and April 2008). He returned to the platform in August 2008, touring with the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra under the direction of Bernard Haitink, and had an Asian recital tour in October and November.\nWhat is Murray Perahia doing now?\nPerahia has made recordings of Chopin’s études, and Schubert’s late piano sonatas. He is presently editing a new Urtext edition of Beethoven’s piano sonatas. In addition to his solo work, Perahia is involved in chamber music and frequently performs with the Guarneri and Budapest String Quartets. He is also Principal Guest Conductor of the Academy of St Martin in the Fields, with whom he records and tours.\nIn January 2009, Murray Perahia became the president of the Jerusalem Music Center founded by violinist Isaac Stern. He stated in an interview with Haaretz newspaper, “Music is an ideal world where all dissonances resolve, where all modulations-that are journeys-return home, and where surprise and stability coexist.\nOn April 1, 2014, Perahia played Mozart’s Piano Concerto No. 20 with the Academy of St Martin in the Fields under Marriner at that conductor’s 90th birthday concert.\nPerahia joined Deutsche Grammophon in 2016, and his first recording for the label was Bach’s French Suites, which was released in October 2016. On April 16, 2024, Perahia played at Wigmore Hall in return after a six-year health absence.\nIs Murray Perahia a teacher?\nUpon graduation from Mannes, Perahia was appointed to the faculty and taught there from 1969 to 1979. Perahia was invited to teach at the International Piano Foundation Theo Lieven (known today as the International Piano Academy Lake Como) to selected students.\nHe has given masterclasses at such institutions as Juilliard School, Stanford University, and Peabody Institute, among many others. He annually conducts a summer course at the Jerusalem Music Centre for young Israeli pianists, aged 12 to 18.\nHe continues to give frequent masterclasses as president of the JMC.

He is best known as a member of the rock bands John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers from 1964 to 1967 and Fleetwood Mac since 1967. His surname, along with that of the drummer Mick Fleetwood, became the basis for the name of the band. He was a founding member of Fleetwood Mac following the band’s inception by guitarist Peter Green in 1967, immediately replacing temporary bass guitarist Bob Brunning.\nAlong with drummer Mick Fleetwood, McVie and Fleetwood are the only members of the band to appear on every Fleetwood Mac release. For more than half a century now, they are the group’s last remaining original members—or nearly original in McVie’s case.\nEarly life\nJohn Graham McVie was born in Ealing, west London, to Reg and Dorothy McVie. He attended Walpole Grammar School. He says that he did have a sister, but she died when she was very young. John McVie started playing the trumpet at an early age, and then, at age 14, he began playing the guitar in local bands, covering songs by the Shadows. He soon realized that his friends were learning lead guitar, so he decided to play the bass guitar instead. He only removed the top two (B and E) strings from his guitar to play the bass parts until his father bought him a pink Fender bass guitar, the same as that used by McVie’s major early musical influence, Jet Harris, the Shadows’ bass player.\nCareer\nMcVie’s first making of music was in the back room of a house in Lammas Park Road, Ealing, with his long-time friends John Barnes and Peter Barnes, who later on formed a group called the Strangers performing Shadows covers.\nMcVie’s first work as a bass player was in a band called the Krewsaders, which the boys living on the same street as McVie in Ealing, West London, formed.

In 1975, Fleetwood Mac became an international superstar overnight after recruiting the American singer-songwriter duo Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham. But marriage problems were deepening for the McVies in the wake of the band’s success, and in 1976, during the Rumors recording session, John and Christine McVie’s marriage was coming to an end as they divorced in the same year. As a way to put behind the hurt and final dissolution, several of Christine’s songs on this album were about John McVie, particularly “Don’t Stop.”. John McVie remarried in 1978 to Julie Ann Reubens but continued to drink heavily.\nIn 1981, McVie agreed to tour with the Bluesbreakers again for their reunion tour with John Mayall, Mick Taylor, and Colin Allen. In 1982, the band toured America, Asia, and Australia (McVie did not participate in the European Tour in 1983 and was replaced by Steve Thompson).\nHow Many Children Does John Graham McVie Have?\nAn alcohol-induced seizure in 1987 finally put McVie off alcohol once and for all, and he has remained teetotal to this day. In 1989, the first of their eventual three children came along when McVie’s wife, Julie Ann, had a daughter called Molly Elizabeth McVie. In his leisure time, McVie is passionate about sailing: he has found himself lost over the Pacific on at least one occasion.\nFleetwood Mac\nAfter McVie joined Fleetwood Mac, the band recorded its first album, Fleetwood Mac, for the following months.

In the following three years, the band had a string of hits in the UK and enjoyed success in continental Europe.\nWho is the wealthiest person in Fleetwood Mac?\nThe richest man in Fleetwood Mac, Lindsey Buckingham, with a net worth of $150M, divorces his wife after 21 years of marriage.\nWhy did Fleetwood Mac break up?\nFleetwood Mac was characterized by relationship fallouts, affairs, drug abuse, and fights during the Rumors album. In the one year of production it took to complete the album and the following six months of touring, the band was holding on by a thread\nWho sang most of Fleetwood Mac’s songs?\nChristine McVie wrote and sang over 50 songs for Fleetwood Mac over the years, including several of its biggest hits. She was often the band’s secret weapon, yet was somewhat overlooked when Nicks became a major solo star and Buckingham asserted himself as a mercurial studio mastermind\nHow many Fleetwood Mac members are still alive?\nWhat does Fleetwood Mac look like today? Current members of Fleetwood Mac include Mick Fleetwood, John McVie, Christine McVie, and Stevie Nicks. Lindsey Buckingham initially rejoined the band to release Say You Will in 2003 but departed in 2018.\nIs Fleetwood Mac still performing?\nStevie Nicks has announced that Fleetwood Mac will not be reuniting. In a new interview, the Hall of Fame singer said that the band will be unable to perform again without Christine McVie, who died in 2022. “Without Christine, no can do,” Nicks said in a new interview with Mojo for the British music magazine’s cover story.\nWhat happened to John McVie?\nIn October 2013, McVie was diagnosed with colon cancer.

Habeeb noted that James is “misleading” Muslim voters by just visiting Islamic centres or mosques to help the branding of his campaign particularly after his anti ceasefire positions.\nDespite being entrusted with the responsibility of addressing the concerns of all constituents, Murray’s lack of genuine interaction and questionable stances have left the Muslim community feeling marginalized and disenchanted.\nHabeeb who met representatives of the Muslim Community in Ealing north noted that there are Key grievances raised by the Muslim residents of Ealing North include:\n- Lack of Meaningful Engagement: James Murray’s tenure has been characterized by a superficial approach to engaging with the Muslim community. While he may make sporadic visits to Muslim centers and mosques for photo opportunities, his interactions lack substance and fail to address the pressing issues faced by Muslim residents on a day-to-day basis.\n- Opposition to Gaza Ceasefire: Many Muslim residents express deep disappointment with Murray’s public stance against a ceasefire in Gaza during times of conflict. His position contradicts the values of peace and humanitarianism cherished by the local Muslim population, further eroding trust in his ability to advocate for their interests effectively.\n- Failure to Address Muslim-Specific Concerns: Murray has shown a lack of commitment to addressing issues specific to the Muslim community, such as Islamophobia, religious discrimination, and cultural integration.\nHis neglect of these critical issues has fueled frustration and disillusionment among Muslim residents, who rightfully expect their elected representative to champion their rights and well-being.\nIn response to Murray’s inadequate representation and tokenistic gestures towards the Muslim community, Sameh Habeeb calls upon mosques and Islamic centers in Ealing North not to allow James Murray and other MPs/candidates to exploit places of worship for election gains.\nHabeeb emphasizes the importance of holding elected officials accountable and rallying behind candidates who genuinely seek to address the concerns of all communities within the constituency.\n“It is time for the Muslim residents of Ealing North to demand authentic representation and proactive engagement from their elected representatives,” said Sameh Habeeb.\n“We cannot afford to be placated by empty gestures and photo opportunities. I urge mosques and Islamic centers to stand in solidarity with their community members and support candidates who are committed to advocating for their interests.” He added\nAs the UK General Election approaches, Sameh Habeeb calls upon Muslim voters in Ealing North to consider his candidacy as a voice of integrity and inclusivity in Parliament.\n📍 For media enquiries or to schedule an interview with Sameh Habeeb, please contact:",
  "https_samehhabeeb_uk_/https_samehhabeeb_uk_people_ealing-people_thomas-henry-huxley-popular-biologist-and-anthropologist-from-ealing/content_94.html": "Thomas Henry Huxley (4 May 1825–29 June 1895) was an English biologist and anthropologist who specialized in comparative anatomy. He has become known as “Darwin’s Bulldog” for his advocacy of Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution. The stories about his famous 1860 Oxford evolution debate with Samuel Wilberforce were a defining moment in the general acceptance of evolution and in his career, although some historians believe that the surviving story of the debate is a later fabrication. Huxley had been scheduled to leave Oxford the previous day, but after meeting with Robert Chambers, the author of Vestiges, he changed his mind and accepted the invitation to join the debate.\nWho was Tom Huxley?\nThomas Henry Huxley (1825-1895), biologist, anthropologist, and philosopher, was born on 4 May 1825 at Ealing, London, the seventh child of George Huxley, schoolmaster, and his wife Rachel.\nEarly Life\nThomas Henry Huxley was born in Ealing, then a village in Middlesex. He was the second youngest of eight children of George Huxley and Rachel Withers. His parents were Church of England members, but he sympathized with nonconformists. Like some other British scientists of the nineteenth century, such as Alfred Russel Wallace, Huxley was brought up in a literate middle-class family that had fallen on hard times. His father was a mathematics teacher at Great Ealing School until it closed, putting the family into financial difficulties. As a consequence, Thomas left school at the age of 10 after only two years of formal education.\nWhat is Thomas Henry Huxley known for?\nDubbed “Darwin’s bulldog” for his combative role in controversies over evolution, Huxley was a leading Victorian zoologist, science popularizer, and education reformer. He was born in Ealing, a small village west of London, in 1825.\nWho was Thomas Huxley, and what did he argue?\nDubbing himself Darwin’s bulldog, Huxley is mostly renowned as a popularizer of Darwinian theory and additionally for his crusade against theology. Yet the man was very much a scientist by his credentials, writing some hundreds of monographs.\nWhy is the Huxley family famous?\nHuxley is an English family. Various members of it have made impressive contributions in the fields of science, medicine, and arts and literature. Other notable positions held by them include high-rank posts within the public services of the United Kingdom.\nVoyage of the Rattlesnake\nAt the age of 20, Huxley was still too young to apply for a license to practice at the Royal College of Surgeons, yet he was “deep in debt.” So, at the suggestion of a friend, he applied for an appointment in the Royal Navy. He brought references on character and certificates of the time he spent on his apprenticeship and requirements like dissection and pharmacy. He was interviewed by the Physician General of the Navy, William Burnett, and the College of Surgeons would test his competency.\nFinally, Huxley was appointed assistant surgeon (‘surgeon’s mate,’ but in practice marine naturalist) to HMS Rattlesnake, which was shortly to sail on a voyage of discovery and surveying to New Guinea and Australia. The Rattlesnake sailed from England on 3 December 1846, and once it reached the southern hemisphere, Huxley devoted his time to the study of marine invertebrates.\nHow Was the Later Life of Thomas Henry?\nAfter a lecture at the Royal Institution on 30 April 1852, Huxley indicated that it was still difficult to earn a living as a scientist alone. This was revealed in a letter written on 3 May 1852, where he comments, “Science in England does everything—but PAY. You may earn praise but not pudding”. However, Huxley effectively resigned from the navy by refusing to return to active service, and in July 1854 he became a professor of natural history at the Royal School of Mines and a naturalist to the British Geological Survey in the following year.\nIn addition, he was Fullerian Professor at the Royal Institution 1855–1858 and 1865–1867; Hunterian Professor at the Royal College of Surgeons 1863–1869; president of the British Association for the Advancement of Science 1869–1870; president of the Quekett Microscopical Club 1878; president of the Royal Society 1883–1885; Inspector of Fisheries 1881–1885; and president of the Marine Biological Association 1884–1890. He was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1869\nPublic duties and awards\nFrom 1870 on, Huxley was to some extent diverted from scientific research by the claims of public duty. He served on eight Royal Commissions from 1862 to 1884. From 1871 to 1880 he was a secretary of the Royal Society, and from 1883 to 1885 he was president. He was president of the Geological Society from 1868 to 1870. In 1870, he was president of the British Association at Liverpool and, in the same year, was elected a member of the newly constituted London School Board. He was president of the Quekett Microscopical Club from 1877 to 1879.\nHe was the leading person amongst those who reformed the Royal Society, persuaded the government about science, and established scientific education in British schools and universities. He was conferred the highest honors then open to British men of science. The Royal Society, which had elected him as a Fellow when he was 25 (1851), awarded him the Royal Medal the next year (1852), a year before Charles Darwin got the same award.\nVertebrate paleontology\nThe first half of Huxley’s career as a paleontologist marks a rather anomalous predilection for ‘persistent types,’ in which it seemed that the evolutionary advance that, in his lexicon, marked major new groups of animals and plants was rare or absent in the Phanerozoic. In the same vein, he tended to push the origin of major groups such as birds and mammals back into the Paleozoic era and to claim that no order of plants had ever gone extinct.\nRoyal and other commissions\nHuxley worked on ten royal and other commissions. The Royal Commission is the senior investigative forum in the British constitution. A rough analysis shows that five commissions involved science and scientific education; three involved medicine, and three involved fisheries. Several involve difficult ethical and legal issues. All deal with possible changes to law and/or administrative practice.\nFamily\nIn 1855, he married Henrietta Anne Heathorn (1825–1914), an English émigré whom he had met in Sydney, Australia. They kept correspondence until he was able to send for her. They had five daughters and three sons.",

  "https_samehhabeeb_uk_/https_samehhabeeb_uk_people_ealing-people_trevor-baylis-the-inventor-from-ealing-who-powered-the-world-with-innovation/content_128.html": "Trevor Graham Baylis CBE was an English inventor most famous for the wind-up radio. The radio, instead of using batteries or an external source of electricity, is powered by the user winding a crank. This stores energy in a spring, which then drives an electrical generator. Baylis invented it due to the necessity to communicate information regarding AIDS to the “people of Africa.” He owned a company under his name that aimed at assisting inventors in developing and protecting their ideas and finding a route to market.\nWhere Did Trevor Bayliss Live?\nBaylis was born to artist Gladys Jane Brown and engineer Cecil Archibald Walter Baylis in Kilburn, London, on 13 May 1937. Baylis hails from Southall, Middlesex. His educational background has been at North Primary School and Dormers Wells Secondary Modern School. Baylis worked first at a soil mechanics laboratory in Southall, through which he studied mechanical and structural engineering through a day-release scheme at a local technical college.\nEarly Life and Career\nA talented swimmer, he competed for Great Britain at 15; he narrowly missed the 1956 Summer Olympics. In 1959, Baylis served his national service as a physical training instructor with the Royal Sussex Regiment, and during that time, he swam for the Army and Imperial Services.\nAfter he left the army, he joined Purley Pools, a company that had recently patented the first freestanding pool. First, he was a salesman, then changed over to R&D after some years.\nBaylis’s performing career as a stuntman exposed him to the needs of disabled people through colleagues whose injuries had ended their performing careers. By 1985, this involvement had led him to invent and develop a range of products for the disabled called Orange Aids.\nWhat Did Trevor Baylis Invent?\nIn the late 1980s or early 1990s, Baylis saw a television program about the spread of AIDS in Africa and had the idea that one way to slow the spread of the disease was to educate and inform by radio. In 30 minutes, he came up with the prototype of his most famous invention, the wind-up radio. The prototype included a small transistor radio, an electric motor from a toy car, and the clockwork mechanism from a music box. Baylis filed his first patent in 1992. The prototype worked, but Baylis could not find a production partner.\nWhat is Trevor Baylis famous for?\nIt was then in 1994 when his prototype appeared in a film made by Liz Tucker for the BBC TV program Tomorrow’s World, which saw him get an investor to sponsor the product. Investors’ money saw him set up a company called Freeplay Energy; in 1996, Freeplay Radio received the BBC Design Awards for Best Product and Best Design. That year Baylis also met Queen Elizabeth II and Nelson Mandela at a state banquet and also toured Africa with the Dutch Television Service to produce a documentary about his life. That year he received the 1996 World Vision Award for Development Initiative.\nWhy did Trevor Baylis invent the wind-up radio?\nThe free-play radio that came out in South Africa in 1997, a smaller and less expensive model developed specifically for the Western consumer market, makes use of rechargeable cells using a generic crank generator. In the 1990s, Baylis appeared regularly on Channel 4’s breakfast program, The Big Breakfast\nIn 2001 he completed a 100-mile walk across the Namib Desert to demonstrate his “electric shoes,” raising money for the Mines Advisory Group. The “electric shoes,” developed in cooperation with the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency of the UK, consist of piezoelectric contacts located in the heel and charge up a small battery that can drive a radio transceiver or cellular telephone.\nTrevor Baylis Foundation\nBaylis founded the Trevor Baylis Foundation to “encourage and facilitate the activity of invention.” This led in September 2002 to the establishment of the company ‘Trevor Baylis Brands PLC,’ whereby inventors obtained professional partnerships as well as services to support them in bringing their novelty before the courts or patent offices as appropriate, getting their products launched into the marketplace.\nThe company was interested in licensing agreements for inventors but also had an interest in creating new companies around good ideas. The company was headquartered in Richmond, Greater London. In 2013, it was reported that the company was financially failing and survived only on Baylis’ private finances. Two months after his death, Trevor Baylis Brands PLC declared insolvent, and it stopped trading at the beginning of 2019.\nHobbies and Interests\nBaylis lived for many years on Eel Pie Island on the River Thames. He often would go to see live jazz at the Eel Pie Island Hotel. Baylis was a pipe smoker, and in 1999, he received the Pipe Smoker of the Year award from the British Pipesmokers’ Council.\nHardships and Challenges\nIt was reported in 2013 that Baylis was suffering from personal financial hardship and living in relative poverty because he earned little money from his commercialized wind-up power invention, especially since he had lost legal control over the product after it had been re-engineered by his corporate partners, and he continued to earn only a meager income as an after-dinner motivational speaker. Baylis said in March 2010 that when he was five, he was sexually abused by a Church of England curate. This is mentioned in his 1999 autobiography, Clock This.\nDeath and Funeral\nHe died on 5 March 2018 at the age of 80 after a fall on a path on Eel Pie Island, having been afflicted with Crohn’s disease in his final years. At the time of his death, he was unmarried and had no living next of kin. A funeral was held at Mortlake Crematorium on 13 March 2018, where his body was cremated in a novelty coffin fashioned as the wind-up radio that he had invented\nHonours and Awards\nBaylis was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire for humanitarian services in the 1997 Birthday Honours and a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 2015 New Year Honours for services to intellectual property. Baylis received 11 honorary degrees from UK universities. He gained an honorary doctorate from Heriot-Watt University in 2003, Leeds Metropolitan University in 2005, and the University of Northampton in 2009.",
  "https_samehhabeeb_uk_/https_samehhabeeb_uk_people_ealing-people_dorita-fairlie-bruce-from-ealing-the-legacy-of-the-dimsie-series/content_126.html": "Dorita Fairlie Bruce (20 May 1885–21 September 1970) was a Scottish children’s author who wrote the popular Dimsie series of books published between 1921 and 1941. Her books were second in popularity only to Angela Brazil’s during the 1920s and 1930s. The Dimsie books alone had sold half a million hardback copies by 1947. You will be surprised to know that her books are still popular among many different generations.\nEarly life\nDorita Fairlie Bruce was born Dorothy Morris Fairlie Bruce in Palos, Huelva, Spain, on 20 May 1885, to Alexander Fairlie Bruce MICE (7 September 1857 [2] – 20 January 1944). He was a Scottish civil engineer, and Katherine (Kate) Elizabeth Fairbairn (c. 1861–1931), the daughter of William Freebairn of Drummilling, West Kilbride, Ayrshire.\nBruce’s early childhood was spent in Scotland, first at Blanefield among the Campsie Hills, Stirling, an area that was to feature in many of her early stories. Later at Blairgowrie, Perthshire, where her brother Alan Cathcart Fairlie Bruce (2 March 1894–10 October 1927), her only sibling, was born. In 1895 her father got the contract to build the Staines Reservoirs, next to what is now Heathrow Airport, and the family moved south to Ealing in west London.\nHow did Dorita Fairlie Bruce contribute to the Girls’ Guildry?\nApart from her writing, Bruce seems to have led a life similar to that of many other unmarried middle-class women of her time, devoted to family duties and voluntary work. She looked after her invalid mother and later her aging father and helped to bring up her brother’s three children after his early death. For more than 30 years, from about 1916 to the late 40s, she was engaged in the Girls’ Guildry.\nThis was a uniformed girls’ organization founded in 1900 by Dr. William Francis Somerville and originally associated with the Church of Scotland but later spread over other parts of Britain and the Empire. She was, for a period in the 30s, president of its West London Centre.\nMoreover, she contributed factual articles to the Lamp of the Girls’ Guildry magazine, and Girls’ Guildry plays a role in her Nancy series and gets a mention in her Dimsie series. In July 1965, The Girls’ Guildry merged the Girls’ Life Brigade Service of England and the Girls Brigade of Ireland to become the Girls’ Brigade.\nWhy is Dorita Fairlie Bruce considered an influential children’s author?\nLike so many other writers, she started writing at an early age and is said to have won a competition for poetry at the age of six. The first time she used her pen name ‘Dorita’ was in small handwritten magazines. After leaving school, she wrote a great number of poems and short stories in various genres for juvenile periodicals and anthologies from about 1905. Most of her short stories are set in Scotland, like the ‘Regiment’ stories, about two children and their pets living with their grandmother in the Campsie Hills. This is also partly the setting of the long historical romance “Greenmantle” (The Girl’s Realm, 1914–15).\nHer first known school story, “The Rounders Match” (The Girl’s Realm, 1909), is set in a school, ‘St. Hilary’s,’ vaguely reminiscent of Clarence House. She was a pioneer in creating a series of books that followed a group of girls throughout their schooldays and even beyond. Her Dimsie, Nancy, and Springdale series all follow this pattern, which was widely imitated.\nWhat are the famous books and series of Dorita?\nHere is a list of books by Dorita Fairlie Bruce in the Dimsie series:\n-\n- Dimsie Goes to School\n-\n- Dimsie Moves Up\n-\n- Dimsie, Head Girl\n-\n- Dimsie Moves Up Again\n-\n- Dimsie Among the Prefects\n-\n- Dimsie Grows Up\n-\n- Captain at Springdale\n-\n- The New House Captain\n-\n- The New House at Springdale\n-\n- Dimsie Intervenes\nHere is a list of books in the St. Bride’s and Maudsley (Nancy) series:\n-\n- The Girls of St. Bride’s\n-\n- That Boarding School Girl\n-\n- The New Girl and Nancy\n-\n- Nancy to the Rescue\n-\n- Nancy at St. Bride’s\n-\n- Nancy in the Sixth\n-\n- Nancy Returns to St. Bride’s\n-\n- Nancy Calls the Tune\nHere is a list of books in the Springdale series:\n-\n- The Best House in the School\n-\n- Captain of Springdale\n-\n- The new house at Springdale\n-\n- Books by Dorita Fairlie Bruce in the Toby series:\n-\n- The School on the Moor\n-\n- The School in the Woods\n-\n- Toby at Tibbs Cross\nList of Books in the Sally series:\n-\n- Sally Scatterbrain\n-\n- Sally Again\n-\n- Sally’s Summer Term\nWhat is the Dimsie series about?\nThe best-known books of Dorita are the nine ‘Dimsie’ books (1921–41), seven of them set in the ‘Jane Willard Foundation’ (‘Jane’s’) in Kent, the other two in Dimsie’s family home, ‘Twinkle Tap,’ on ‘Loch Shee’ (Gael. ‘Loch of the Fairies’) in Argyll. Any exact site has never been identified. Jane’s is situated on the Kentish coast, most likely at St. Margaret’s Bay, but the buildings are modeled on Bruce’s old school, Clarence House. The school stories follow Dimsie (Daphne Isabel Maitland) from a 10-year-old junior to the popular head girl. The Dimsie books are famous for the ‘Anti-Soppists,’ a group of six girls acting for the good of the school. As her popularity kept soaring, she continued to give one interesting book after the other.\nWhere Did Dorita Fairlie Bruce Die?\nBruce was above all, despite all her years in London, a Scottish writer. She often went back to Scotland for holidays, as witnessed by the detailed descriptions of the landscape in her many books set there. Not until 1949 was she free to move back to Scotland, to the big house she had bought in Upper Skelmorlie in the northern part of Ayrshire. In this house with its marvelous view of the Firth of Clyde, named ‘Triffeny’ after one of her books, she spent the last 21 years of her life, dying there aged 85 on 21 September 1970.",

He is known for designs that are highly majestic and filled with spiritual feelings. His architectural designs can be seen throughout Southern England. In his architectural design, Prynne showed strong adherence to the Anglo-Catholic principles and his unparalleled ability to fuse art and architecture together.\nEarly Life and Education\nBorn on April 2, 1853, in Wyndham Square, Plymouth, Devon, George Halford Fellowes Prynne was the second son of Rev. George Rundle Prynne and Emily Fellowes, daughter of Admiral Sir Thomas Fellowes. His elder brother, Edward Arthur Fellowes Prynne, would later become a celebrated painter.\nPrynne started his academic life at St Mary’s College, Harlow, then followed by Chardstock College, and ended at Eastman’s Royal Naval Academy in Southsea. The varied educational backgrounds as such contributed much to the special architectural ideas.\nThe Road to Architecture\nAt age 18, in the year 1871, Prynne went to America to work on a farm owned by a cousin of his in the western states. However, he did not like that kind of labor hard and forcing. Almost two years later, he went to Toronto, Canada, where he eventually became a junior assistant in the office of architect Richard Cunningham Windyer.\nPrynne rapidly made his way to the top rung, becoming a senior in less than four years. His exceptional talent was recognized by the influential architect George Edmund Street, under whom he worked for a year. He subsequently worked with Swinfen Harris, R.J. Withers, Alfred Waterhouse, and the London School Board before finally establishing an independent practice in 1879. In the meantime, from 1876 to 1878, he attended the Royal Academy.\nParish Churches and Restorations\nGeorge Fellowes Prynne specialized in parish church design, especially for the southeastern and southwestern parts of England. He designed buildings on a grand scale with an emphasis on details and spiritual significance according to the High Church Gothic Revival style. More than 200 buildings were either designed or restored during his career as a great architect.\nAmong his greatest works are:\n- All Saints Church, West Dulwich: An excellent representation of his artistry as an architect.\n- St Peter’s, Budleigh Salterton: A designed parish church that has inspired many generations of its worshippers.\n- Prynne’s architectural ability was not only in new designs but also in restoration work. He restored several churches to their former glory and historical and spiritual integrity.\nCollaboration with Edward Arthur Fellowes Prynne\nOne of the peculiar characteristics of Prynne’s work is that he worked alongside his brother, Edward Arthur Fellowes Prynne. Through the artistic work that Edward produced for several of George’s churches, much beauty and depth were achieved.\nSome of these examples are\n- St Peter’s Church, Staines-Stained glass windows are remarkable works of great artistry on display\n- Holy Trinity, Roehampton Altar panels and\n- St Mary, East Grinstead Altar panels\n- A reredos at St Mary the Virgin Church, Hayes, where both brothers are buried\n- Architect to the Diocese of Oxford\n- In 1913, Prynne was made Architect to the Diocese of Oxford. He could now impact ecclesiastical architecture at a diocesan level and thus broaden his legacy\nWas George Halford Fellowes Prynne Married?\nIn June 1882, Prynne married Bertha Geraldine Bradbury in Wandsworth, London. He was a man of devoutly religious nature with Anglo-Catholic convictions who led a household steeped in daily family prayers and spiritual observance.\nThe couple lived at 3 Grange Road, Ealing, where Prynne designed the nearby St. Saviour’s Church on Grove Road. Consecrated in 1899, this church became a focus of the parish. Unfortunately, it was demolished in 1940 due to bomb damage during World War II, but the Clergy House designed by Prynne remains standing.\nPrynne also designed new buildings for St. Saviour’s School, completed in 1927. His works reflect his dedication to community and ecclesiastical architecture. The projects served both spiritual and educational purposes.\nHow Many Children Did George Halford Fellows Prynne Have?\nPrynne and Bertha had seven children. Four of their five sons were in the military. Two of them died in active service. The losses weighed on Prynne’s later years, and his career otherwise was outstanding.\nLegacy and Later Years\nPrynne was not confined to churches alone. He designed the extension of Ealing Town Hall, whose entrance towered octagonal form he completed in 1930. This demonstrates that he could, if necessary, adapt his Gothic revival to civic buildings.\nDespite the personal tragedies he went through, Prynne continued to be one of the most influential figures in English architecture. His designs are still inspirational for architects and worshipers, who stand as testaments to his faith and artistic vision.\nGeorge Halford Fellowes Prynne: The Master of High Church Gothic Revival Architecture\nGeorge Halford Fellowes Prynne (1853–1927) was a notable Victorian and Edwardian English church architect, with a significant contribution to the High Church Gothic Revival style. His architectural legacy covers Southern England, with over 200 churches designed or restored under his guidance. Prynne’s work is characterized by its grandeur, spiritual depth, and meticulous attention to detail, often in collaboration with his brother, Edward Arthur Fellowes Prynne, who contributed stunning artwork to many of his projects. Prynne’s designs continue to inspire, blending artistic excellence with a profound sense of faith and community.\nA Lasting Influence\nGeorge Halford Fellowes Prynne’s architectural skills, dedication, and spiritual depth are reflected in his work. He was always able to synthesize art with architecture, quite often in association with his brother, to build spaces of beautiful reverence.\nAs some of his works, like St. Saviour’s Church, have vanished into the pages of history, others continue as living centers of worship and community. His contributions to Gothic Revival architecture and being an architect to the Diocese of Oxford further show him to be of significance in the history of architecture in England.\nWhat endures beyond these buildings is spiritual and artistic inspiration given to generation after generation of architects and worshipers by a man of faith and the great George Halford Fellowes Prynne, whose impact towers above much in the annals of English ecclesiastical architecture.",

  "https_samehhabeeb_uk_/https_samehhabeeb_uk_people_ealing-people_jay-kay-from-ealing-musician-to-jamiroquai-icon/content_89.html": "Jay Kay is a British singer and songwriter. In 1992, he co-founded the acid jazz and funk band Jamiroquai and still serves as their lead vocalist. As of 2017, the band had sold more than 26 million albums worldwide. Except for music, he was also known for his enthusiasm towards luxury cars and made several guest appearances in the shows Top Gear and Fifth Gear. He contributed to environmental causes too. Kay was in one of the high-profile relationships with Denise van Outen.\nEarly life\nJay Kay was born Jason Luís in Stretford, Lancashire, on 30 December 1969, to English cabaret singer Karen Kay and Portuguese guitarist Luís Saraiva. His parents split up, and he did not meet his biological father until he was about 28. Kay’s identical twin, David, died of brain damage a few weeks after the two were born. Kay said in a 2010 interview that his mother raised him largely alone, which gave him “an itinerant childhood”, half of which he spent “living in rural Suffolk.” He moved back to Manchester with his mother and stepfather, Mervyn Kay, after briefly living in Blackburn as a youngster. He often accompanied his mother at her performances and later attended Oakham School in Oakham.\nWhy Is Jamiroquai Famous?\nKay formed Jamiroquai in 1992. Band members included Toby Smith (keyboards), Nick Van Gelder (drums, 1992–1993), Derrick McKenzie (drums, 1994–present), and Wallis Buchanan (didgeridoo). After the success of Jamiroquai’s first single, “When You Gonna Learn,” Kay signed a US$1 million record deal with Sony Soho2. The band’s first album was Emergency on Planet Earth. The collaboration with Sony ended in 2007. The group has sold over 26 million albums worldwide. Kay is sometimes called ‘Jamiroquai’ because of the misconception that the group is a solo artist.\nTV appearances\nKay appeared in an episode of the BBC series The Naked Chef with chef Jamie Oliver, and he performed on the series Strictly Come Dancing singing “Canned Heat.”. He has made many other TV guest appearances as either a singer, interviewee, or both, including on The Word, The Girlie Show, The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Friday Night with Jonathan Ross, Rove, and many others.\nJay Kay has featured on four episodes of the BBC motoring show Top Gear. In series 1, episode 2, he set a lap time of 1:48.1 for the show’s “Star in a Reasonably Priced Car” using the Suzuki Liana, holding the fastest lap time for all of the first series and most of the second series. In series 3, episode 4, Kay drove his Lamborghini Miura with Richard Hammond as a passenger. His third appearance was in series 11, episode 6, where his lap time of 1:45.81 using the Chevrolet Lacetti beat the top time held by Simon Cowell\nHow Many Legal Cases Does Jay Kay Have?\nIn April 2001, Kay was charged with assaulting a photographer and damaging his camera outside the Attica nightclub in London’s West End. Kay pleaded not guilty, and the charges were dropped due to lack of evidence. In May 2002, Kay was interviewed by police following an altercation at a premiere party for Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones, outside the St Martin’s Lane Hotel, where it was alleged a photographer kicked his £70,000 Bentley after Kay had attempted to grab him as his car drove off.\nKay harassed the photographer and his girlfriend, and the man head-butted him in the nose so hard that it was severely damaged. The two were separated as blood was running from Kay’s broken nose. The fight almost continued inside the hotel, and Kay was photographed in a distressed state. He sported a black eye at his next gig. He was also reported to have gotten into a scuffle at an after-party for the 2002 BRIT Awards.\nIn March 2009, Kay’s black Ferrari Enzo received almost £10,000 of damage in an altercation with Brudenell Hotel chef Aaron Billington in Aldeburgh. Billington, intoxicated and acting due to romantic infatuation over a woman to whom Kay was speaking, was sacked and sent to prison for 20 weeks.\nPersonal life\nJay Kay is married to Maria Kay, and they have two daughters, Carla and Tallulah. The track “Carla” from the Automaton album is a tribute to his first daughter. There is also a track called “Talullah” from Jamiroquai’s 2005 album Dynamite, although the spelling on the album is different from his daughter’s name. Kay said in 2010 that he had a “serious” cocaine habit before giving up drugs in 2003, which he said was prompted when Denise van Outen broke up with him.\nWhere Did the First Few Gigs of Jay Kay Happen?\nKay used to live in the Ealing area of London, where he played some of his first gigs. Since 1995 he has owned Horsenden Manor at Horsenden, near Princes Risborough in Buckinghamshire, where he has a recording studio, granary, and garages. In 2020 he applied to extend the property. In another interview, he spoke about how he has made his home environmentally sustainable, including tending to his garden without pesticides, caring for livestock, creating an eco-friendly waste-removal system at great cost, and maximizing his recycling. Kay and the band also put aside a significant portion of their royalties to environmental causes.\nHow much is Jay Kay worth?\nJay Kay has earned around $70 million through his career.\nIs Jay Kay still with his wife?\nKay is married to Maria Kay, and they have two daughters, Carla and Tallulah. The track “Carla” from the Automaton album is a tribute to his first daughter.\nIs Jamiroquai still active?\nJamiroquai was among the very few, London-based, short-lived movements of the funk and acid jazz phenomenon in the 1990s. Today they stand alone as the only ones who continue touring. And large arenas continue to be filled.\nHow many cars does Jay Kay own?\nThe collection is privately run by Jay Kay, who regularly uses his cars both privately and at events such as the Goodwood Festival of Speed.

  "https_samehhabeeb_uk_/https_samehhabeeb_uk_people_ealing-people_alan-rickman-ealings-legendary-actor/content_66.html": "Alan Rickman, who was born on 21 February 1946 in London, England, passed away on 14 January 2016. He was one of Britain’s fine actor personalities who dodged characterization alchemy throughout his successful and commendable theatre, film, and television career, whereby he depicted a diverse palette of characters, though wicked. As Hans Gruber, the scary foe in the action motion picture Die Hard (1988), Rickman made one of the scariest villains ever to grace the big screen.\nTo a whole new generation of cinemagoers, he was revealed in the 21st century as the master of dramatic introspection, playing the dark and enigmatic Severus Snape, who is revealed as the wary but adolescent teacher of Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone (2001), who later transforms into an unexpected companion in the final part of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 (2011).\nEarly Life\nRickman was born the middle child of three children to Bernard Rickman—a factory worker who died when Alan Rickman was eight years old—and Margaret. The parents of Alan Rickman grew up on a council estate, which is a type of British social housing. He first performed on stage at the age of 11, featuring in a school play, and afterwards has a degree in graphic design. Rickman attended Chelsea College of Art and Design and then the Royal College of Art, both in London. At the latter, he met Rima Horton, with whom he has been in a long-term relationship (he married her in 2012).\nRickman left school in the late 1960s, started his own design company in London, and briefly worked in the graphic arts until he suddenly realized that what he wanted to do was to act. He then went through the process of auditioning for the recognized Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, which is based in London, and got admission. Rickman had trained at RADA from 1972 to 1974, receiving some of their most distinguished awards for his performances. He then did stage acting with other British repertory and experimental theatre troupes and with the Royal Shakespeare Company.\nBreakthrough Role\nThe big break for Rickman was in 1985 when he was cast as the lead in the play Les Liaisons Dangereuses in a role created with him in mind by playwright Christopher Hampton, who adapted the play from an eighteenth-century French novel at the request of the actor. “Alan was able to capture not only the viewer, Hampton continued, “but it appeared as though he also had a kind of hypnosis on the people he was sharing scenes with.”\nRickman originated the wickedly delicious performance on stage in London and later on Broadway, for which he was nominated for a Tony. In 1988 the play Les Liaisons Dangereuses was transferred to film with the title Dangerous Liaisons, and the actor John Malkovich got the part of Vicomte de Valmont.\nVillainous Roles\nRickman was soon approached for his first movie in Hollywood—an indescribably wicked terrorist Hans Gruber who Bruce Willis’s valorous copper John McCLane outsmarts in Die Hard, which was released in 1988. Speaking later about the situation when he received the role for Die Hard, Rickman said, “I got Die Hard because I came cheap. They were paying Willis $7 million, so they had to find people they could pay nothing.”\nAfter appearing alongside Tom Selleck in Quigley Down Under (1990), Rickman starred in three successful features in 1991: Close My Eyes; Truly, Madly, Deeply; and Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves again as an indelible Sheriff of Nottingham. This role, accentuating the first impression made in Die Hard, cemented Rickman’s image as a “villain” actor—a title Rickman disliked: None of [my roles] do I view as one word. It doesn’t matter what I’m playing, and I think that nobody would be able to say that it is one word.”\nHarry Potter Film Series\nRickman’s output slowed following his prolific year in 1991, although he made well-received appearances in Sense and Sensibility (1995) and in the title role of Rasputin: Death Servant of Destiny (1996), for which he won the Golden Globe as well as the Emmy television awards. He directed his first feature, The Winter Guest, co-written with his Sense and Sensibility actress Emma Thompson and her real-life mother Phyllida Law in 1997. He also delivered comedic roles in this year’s Dogma and the delightful sci-fi spoof Galaxy Quest.\nRickman was also cast in several other films in the ’90s, but his next highly-publicized role was in the early part of the 2000s as Professor Snape in the Harry Potter series. For the role of Snape, author J.K. Rowling wanted to cast Rick Man and provided additional unpublished information about the character a has been to prepare him for the part.\nWhat was the cause of Alan Rickman’s death?\nIn August 2015, Rickman suffered a small stroke, after which pancreatic cancer was diagnosed. He told his closest friends and family that he had terminal cancer. On 14 January 2016, he died in London at the age of 69. His body was cremated on 3 February 2016 at the West London Crematorium in Kensal Green.\nWhat did Daniel Radcliffe say when Alan Rickman died?\nHere’s what Radcliffe wrote (emphasis mine): “Alan Rickman is undoubtedly one of the greatest actors I will ever work with. He is also one of the loyalest and most supportive people I’ve ever met in the film industry. He was so encouraging of me both on set and in the years post-Potter.\nWho is Alan Rickman’s wife?\nRima Horton is the wife of Alan Rickman. They stayed together from 2012 to 2016.\nDid Alan Rickman have kids?\nAfter the wedding in New York, we strolled across the Brooklyn Bridge and had lunch. He quipped that he bought her a $200 ring she never wears. The couple never had any children, and Alan once quipped about this decision: “You should remember I am not the only one involved.\nWhat did Alan Rickman say about Emma Watson?\nAlan Rickman Criticized Emma Watson’s Diction in ‘Harry. ‘Harry Potter’ star Alan Rickman thought Emma Watson’s diction was ‘this side of Albania at times’ in early films, according toa personal diary.",
  "https_samehhabeeb_uk_/https_samehhabeeb_uk_people_ealing-people_edward-arthur-fellowes-prynne-the-visionary-artist-of-ealing/content_82.html": "Edward Arthur Fellowes Prynne was born in 1854 and died in 1921. He was a leading British late Pre-Raphaelite painter of portraits and subject pictures, who in later life became one of the country’s best-known creators of decorative art for churches.\nFamily and Early Life\nBorn in Plymouth on 14 October 1854, Prynne was the third son of Emily Fellowes (daughter of Admiral Sir Thomas Fellowes KCB DCL) and the Cornish Revd George Rundle Prynne, the notable tractarian and ritualist. His brother was the church architect George Fellowes Prynne.\nPrynne was educated at Eastman’s Royal Naval Academy in Southsea, being originally intended for the Navy. But at the suggestion of Frederic Leighton, he decided to embark on an artistic career. After preliminary training in art schools in London, he traveled to Antwerp, where he studied with the Belgian painter Charles Verlat. He then went on to study in Florence, Paris, and Rome.\nPrynne married Emma Mary Joll in 1888, with whom he had two sons and three daughters: Beatrice Mary Fellowes Prynne (1893–1993), Dorothy Etheldreda Prynne (1894–1983), George Michael Fellowes Prynne (1896–1973), Stella Christine Marie Prynne (1898–1957), and John Rundle Fellowes Prynne (1903–1931).\nWas Edward Arthur Fellowes Prynne a Painter?\nPrynne excelled across a wide range of styles and subjects. He was a brilliant traditional portrait artist. His work was sought by the royal family and the politicians. He painted over 60 portraits and was commissioned to paint a life-size portrait of the Duke of Edinburgh as Admiral of the Fleet. On command from Queen Victoria, he presented it at Osborne House, and that portrait hung at the Royal Naval Barracks, Devonport. He also often created almost psychedelic pictures of mythological and religious pictures. The list includes ‘Cophetua’s Queen,’ ‘Orpheus and Eurydice,’ ‘Pan and Syrinx,’ and ‘Silent Voices of the Studio.’\nReligious Work\nPrynne shared the passionate Anglo-Catholic faith of his father and brother, George Fellowes Prynne. He is primarily known for his religious art, which was commissioned and bought for churches throughout the county—specifically in Devon and Cornwall. In many cases, Prynne’s painted altar and reredos panels and stained glass adorn the churches designed and restored by his brother.\nOne of Prynne’s most striking and original works is his altarpiece, ‘Benedicite Domino Laudate Et Superexaltate Eum in Saecula,’ which consists of five painted panels illustrating separate lines from the canticle of creation. In that panel, combining Prynne’s mythological and religious worlds, a sub-marine angel is garbed in scales and delicate fish fin wings.\nEdward Arthur Fellowes Prynne: A Legacy of Anglo-Catholic Devotion\nThe painting was exhibited at the Royal Society of British Artists 114th Exhibition of 1896; a commentator noted, ‘Mr. E. A. Fellowes Prynne shows an altarpiece, “Benedicite,” rich in color and the mannerisms of the artist.’. Other artists who received passing remarks of praise by the otherwise lukewarm critic were W. Graham Robertson, William Luker, and Tom Robertson.\nPrynne’s painting ‘Magnificat’ came in 1894 to the New Gallery on Regents Street, London. Other exhibits included ‘Love among the Ruins’ by Edward Burne Jones, as well as work by Lawrence Alma-Tadema, George Frederic Watts, Leonard Leslie Brooke, Charles Edward Hallé, Edward Matthew Hale, Walter Crane, William Laidlaw, and John Roddam Spencer Stanhope, George Hitchcock and George Frampton.’Magnificat’ also appeared at the L’Exposition Internationale du Bruxelles in 1897, where it was thought by a reviewer to be ‘an exquisite conception.’.\nPrynne’s ‘Ecce Ancilla Domini,’ also made during the same year, was found worthy of praise for its beauty, delicacy, and composition. It was shown in the Royal Society of British Artists exhibition of 1895. Both of these pictures were given to St Mark’s Church, Hadlow Down, Sussex, by Mr. C. Lang Huggins.\nPrynne’s Artistic Influence in Religious and Secular Exhibitions\n‘The Desire of all Nations,’ a painting of the nativity, is one of the chief works of Prynne, and it became very famous. It was shown at the Royal Academy in 1895, and the critic for The Antiquary commented that the painting could be hung in a church. This was indeed to be the painting’s fate, for it was bought by the Rev. Harry Wilson for St. Augustine’s Church, Stepney, along with a cycle of Prynne’s Stations of the Cross.\nThe copyrights of both ‘Magnificat’ and ‘The Desire of all Nations’ were bought by the Berlin Photographic Company in 1896 and then photogravure printed and widely distributed in all parts of the world. The paintings were included in a Berlin Photographic Company ‘Catalogue of Select Publications’ in 1906\nWhen Did Prynne Die?\nRepresenting the pinnacle of his painted devotional work, in 1918, the Anglican religious order the Cowley Fathers approached Prynne to create a set of 14 painted Stations of the Cross for St John the Evangelist Church, Oxford. Prynne thought that the church “afforded a unique opportunity by reason of the splendid wall space” and regarded the commission as “a very great pleasure and high privilege,” and over the next few years, he and the Fathers wrangled over the details.\nThe striking—although not unproblematic—set of images was finally installed in the church in 1921. The station depicting Christ’s trial is based on Prynne’s earlier picture, ‘Christ Before Pilate,’ painted in 1898. The last four ‘Stations’ were the final paintings on which Prynne worked—the last painting he touched was the ‘Entombment of Christ.’\nHow Many Children Did Edward Arthur Fellowes Prynne Have?\nOn 29 September 1922, Emma Prynne, widow of Prynne, presented in his memory the famous 1898 painting ‘Christ Before Pilate’ to St Peter’s Church, Ealing. (In 1947, one of Prynne’s daughters donated as well a set of photographic reproductions of his Stations of the Cross for the Cowley Fathers—now lost).\nIn 1934, Beatrice, Yule, and their three children visited Emma Fellowes Prynne, who still lived at number 1 Woodville Road in Ealing. Edward Arthur Fellowes Prynne’s studio in the garden remained partly furnished as before his death 23 years before. Emma Fellowes Prynne’s daughter Beatrice later emigrated from South Africa to New Zealand.",

He is an English musician, co-founder, guitarist, second lead vocalist, and principal songwriter of the Who, one of the most influential rock bands of the 1960s and 1970s. He has been acclaimed for his intense playing style and poetic songwriting techniques with the Who and in other projects.\nWhere was Pete Townshend born?\nTownshend was born in Chiswick Hospital, Netheravon Road, Chiswick, West London, UK. Townshend came from a musical family background: his father, Cliff Townshend, was the alto saxophonist with Squadronaires, a dance band of the Royal Air Force, and his mother, Betty (née Dennis), used to sing for the Sidney Torch and Les Douglass Orchestras.\nPaul and Simon Townshend were born in 1957 and 1960, respectively. Poor grades for university meant that Townshend had the options of art school, music school, or finding a job to work.[24] In reality, he ended up at Ealing Art College studying graphic design in the same year, 1961. In college, Townshend was learning next to future Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood. Townshend left in 1964 to make music full-time.\nThe Detours: 1961–1964\nHe began in 1961 with The Detours, a skiffle/rock and roll band where Roger Daltrey was leader. At this time, John Entwistle played bass. Doug Sandom was the drummer for them and did all the big hits in pop and jazz. Once Daltrey was the lead vocalist, Townshend was the lone guitarist, then in 1964 they renamed them The Who, quite the change.\nThe Who, 1964–1982\nThey were soon the talk of the town with their high-energy live show and music. Keith Moon was soon signed up to be their drummer, and the first single they had put out, “I Can’t Explain,” soared straight to the top of the charts in 1965. Soon they became attention magnets as well due to Townshend’s on-stage instrument destruction while playing his guitar like a windmill on his Stratocaster.\nMany of the albums My Generation and Tommy featured work from Townshend, an extremely prolific songwriter. The list includes the critical and commercial smash rock opera Tommy (1969), but also the most influential Who’s Next (1971) and Quadrophenia (1973).\nTownshend has thrown feedback guitar playing and wildly theatrical live shows right into the middle of rock music. He has composed over 100 songs for The Who and is also the originator of the concept of rock opera. Despite the loss of Moon and Entwistle, this group was one of the most successful live performances in rock history and performed their way into several critically acclaimed performances in the 21st century.\n1996–Present: Final Recording with The Who\n- Townshend has toured with the remaining members of the Who since the late 1990s, and in 2002 he toured with the other two surviving members after Entwistle’s death.\n- In February 2006, The Who announced a significant world tour to support the band’s first new music since 1982. The semi-autobiographical story serially published on Townshend’s blog since September 2005 is titled The Boy Who Heard Music. He ceased blogging in October 2006.\n- Currently, it is an entirely unrelated user’s account and has nothing at all to do with anything Townshend ever did or is doing. On 25 February 2006, he also announced plans for a mini-opera to be released based on the novella in June 2006. In October 2006, the Who finally released their first new album in 24 years: Endless Wire.\n- The Who performed at Super Bowl XLIV halftime on 7 February 2010, performing a medley that included “Pinball Wizard”, “Who Are You?” “Baba O’Riley,” “See Me, Feel Me,” and “Won’t Get Fooled Again.”. In 2012, The Who announced they would tour the rock opera Quadrophenia.\n- The Who closed the 2012 Summer Olympics in London when they performed the medley “Baba O’Riley,” “See Me, Feel Me,” and “My Generation.”\n- On 22 March 2018, Townshend said a new Who album should contain original songs by Roger Daltrey and him. That album, simply titled Who, was released on 6 December 2019. It was their second as a duo and the first in thirteen years.\nHow Many Affairs Did Pete Townshend Have?\nPete Townshend met Karen Astley, Edwin Astley’s daughter, at art school. The couple got married on 20 May 1968. They used to stay in a townhouse overlooking the Thames at Twickenham. He married three children: Emma, born in 969, who is a columnist on gardening issues; Aminta, born in 1971, was a worker for film productions; and Joseph, who graduated from graphic design, was born in 1989.\nThey divorced in 1994 and later the same year started dating with music artist Rachel Fuller, whom he got secretly married with in 2016. Some of the known properties included Richmond and Surrey. He sold off his Richmond mansion for £15 million above that in 2021.\nIs Pete Townshend bisexual?\nTownshend reported in an interview in 1989 that he “felt proud to have his song ‘Rough Boys’ with its gay undertones,” and the same year, he explained and clarified that his comments had been misinterpreted and he was not coming out. In his autobiography Who I Am, he described himself as “probably bisexual” and once said that he felt attracted to Mick Jagger.\nLegal Issues\nHe was warned by the police in 2003 following an investigation into Operation Ore on child abuse images. He later admitted that he accessed and surfed for research work related to the child abuse networks but testified that no illegal material was found on his computer. He added that he wanted to prove that even those with banks commit such crimes.\nLoss of Hearing\nTownshend is tinnitus- and partially deafened, due to decades of exposure to the sounds of his music career, including an epic drumming mishap that involved an exploding drum set in 1967. He has been a supporter of H.E.A.R.’s foundation since 1989 in order to better advocate for musician’s hearing health. Townshend continues touring using in-ear monitors and studio systems in very sophisticated ways that can help ease his current issues with his hearing.",

Haynes also appeared on radio and in films. In 1965, he appeared in the Rock Hudson/Gina Lollobrigida film Strange Bedfellows. When in Hollywood, Cary Grant happened to visit with an entourage at a location where Haynes was residing and gave great praise lavished on him, stating that he was the greatest comedy star in the world. In 1966, he appeared as a patient in the British film Doctor in Clover.\nEarly life\nArthur Haynes was born in London, the only child of a Fulham baker. He started in several odd jobs, doing painting (he was very proud of his painting in later years), plumbing, and joinery until the Second World War broke out. During the war, he became an entertainer while serving with the Royal Engineers. Fellow comedian Charlie Chester told a story of how they were waiting outside Caen, and Haynes pointed to a trench full of mud and a million tiny frogs and said nothing would get him into that. Just then a German aircraft started firing near them, and Haynes dived straight into the trench and afterwards emerged covered in mud and frogs.\nWhat Was the Arthur Haynes Show?\nWith Charlie Chester, he was a member of the British Army concert party troupe Stars in Battledress. He remained with Chester after the war in the BBC Radio Series Stand Easy (1946–49). Chester hadn’t wanted to include him because he had a full cast, but when he heard Haynes give a high-pitched laugh, he knew he could use it and found a place for him. They became a double act in the show where Chester wrote the scripts. Much later, the comedian returned to BBC Radio with The Arthur Haynes Show (1962–65), which ran over four series. He also recorded Arthur Again. Both series were scripted by Johnny Speight. One compilation set titled The Collected Arthur Haynes Show, comprising all seven volumes, was released on 24 April 2017.\nHow Did Arthur Haynes Start His Career?\nOn 21 February 1956, Haynes appeared in the first edition of the ATV variety series Strike a New Note, which was intended to debut talent for the new independent television station. According to Nicholas Parsons (in That Reminds Me, April 1999), the show was terrible, but he was taken on after some initial episodes had been filmed. After a few more shows, there was a clearout, and everyone but Haynes and Parsons went. After several appearances in this show, written by Dick Barry and John Antrobus along with Johnny Speight, who had been sending in sketches for Haynes. The show was soon renamed Get Happy. Haynes, who had been a stand-up comedian, was given his series later in the year, and Parsons, who had been an all-rounder, found himself cast as his straight man.\nWhy is Arthur Haynes the Most Popular Comedian?\nHis ATV series, The Arthur Haynes Show (1956–66), networked on ITV, made Haynes the most popular comedian in Britain. There were 95 thirty-minute shows, 62 thirty-five-minute shows, and one fifty-minute show, spread over fifteen series. The most popular of Haynes’s characters was his working-class tramp creation, Johnny Speight, now better known for creating Alf Garnett. He said that the inspiration for the tramp came to him from a real-life tramp who hopped aboard his Rolls-Royce as it sat at a traffic light.\nIn 1963 and 1964, Haynes worked with Dermot Kelly, who played another tramp (called Irish), who was not very bright. Sometimes Patricia Hayes would join them as a female tramp. In early episodes, the shows were played out on a theatre stage, and basic scenery and props were used where, for instance, the audience could see outside and inside a house, as there was no wall on their side. Later episodes had better sets. The stars sometimes forgot or did not bother to learn their lines and would ad-lib them. If someone fluffed a line, that would be used to get more laughs. Haynes and others sometimes failed to keep a straight face and occasionally burst into laughter.\nWho Were the Most Notable Guests at the Arthur Haynes Show?\nMusical guests for the shows would include the Spring Fields in 1963, Kenny Ball and his Jazzmen and the Rolling Stones in 1964, and Joe Brown and the Bruvvers and the Dave Clark Five in 1965. A few of the programs opened and closed with Arthur Haynes driving a horse and cart down a rural country lane, whistling and playing (poorly) a harmonica. Some of them are cartoons, beginning with a workman using a road drill on the title.\nRoyal Variety Performance\nHaynes received the Variety Club’s award as ITV Personality of 1961 and appeared on the Royal Variety Performance in the same year. The shows also made a star of Nicholas Parsons, who had first appeared with Haynes in Strike a New Note and Get Happy and who tended to play supercilious neighbors and authority figures in the comedy sketches. Eventually, when the public started to realize that Parsons was a talented straight man, Haynes dropped him. Other stars also made early appearances: in 1962, Michael Caine played a burglar burgling the same house as Haynes’s character. Haynes had a nice singing voice, which he used only rarely on TV, and in 1960 appeared in a sketch called The Haynes Brothers, where he and Dickie Valentine, sporting a mustache, sang together.\nMusic\nIn 1963 he recorded the novelty songs “Not to Worry” and “Looking Around.”.\nWhat happened to Arthur Haynes?\nArthur Haynes died of a heart attack on 19 November 1966 in Ealing, at the age of 52, shortly after he returned from America, where he had appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show, and just before the commencement of shooting for the 16th series of his ITV television series.\nWhere is Arthur Haynes buried?\nHe is buried at Mortlake Cemetery in Kew, London. His wife, Queenie, died on 7 November 2010, aged 95.",
  "https_samehhabeeb_uk_/https_samehhabeeb_uk_people_ealing-people_eric-scerri-ealings-renowned-chemist-philosopher-and-periodic-table-expert/content_53.html": "Eric Scerri (born August 30, 1953, son of Edward and Ines Scerri) is a chemist, writer, and philosopher of science of Maltese origin. He is a lecturer at the University of California, Los Angeles, and the founder and editor-in-chief of Foundations of Chemistry, an international peer-reviewed journal covering the history and philosophy of chemistry and chemical education. He has expertise in the history and philosophy of the periodic table and is an author and editor of several books in this and related fields. Scerri appeared in the 2014 PBS documentary film, The Mystery of Matter.\nWhere did Eric Scerri get education from?\nScerri studied at Walpole Grammar School, Ealing. He completed his BSc at Westfield College, University of London, followed by a Certificate in Postgraduate Study at the University of Cambridge and then an MPhil at the University of Southampton before pursuing his PhD from King’s College London.\nResearch interests\nEric’s work has mainly been in the history and philosophy of chemistry, with a particular focus on how far chemistry reduces to quantum mechanics. He specializes in the study of the periodic table of elements, including their historical origins and their philosophical significance. More recent writings have included critiques of claims for the emergence of chemistry and the existence of downward causation.\nBesides his historical and philosophical work, Scerri has authored numerous articles in the chemical education literature, accounts of the electronic structures of transition metals, and the occurrence of anomalous electron configurations.\nWhat is a Tale of Seven Elements about?\nIn A Tale of Seven Elements (2013), Scerri elaborates the tale of the discovery of the seven missing elements from the periodic table a little more than at the turn of the 20th century. Both setbacks, dubious claims, and sometimes even vitriolic disputes and priority contests are involved.\nWhen Was Eric Scerri Appointed for a Project?\nAppointed for the chair role of a project recommended on the composition by IUPAC in December of the year 2015, such that it settles whether group 3 should either be the elements Sc, Y, La, and Ac, or Sc, Y, Lu, and Lr. In January 2021, the project published a preliminary report in IUPAC’s news magazine Chemistry International suggesting Sc, Y, Lu, and Lr. This agrees with an earlier IUPAC report in 1988 and with a suggestion made by Lev Landau and Evgeny Lifshitz in their Course of Theoretical Physics.\nMost recently, he proposed a new evolutionary approach to the philosophy of science in 2016 based on seven case studies of little-known scientists such as John Nicholson, Anton Van den Broek, and Edmund Stoner. Scerri has argued that these lesser-known figures are just as important as heroic personalities in that they constitute the missing gaps in a gradual evolutionary and organic growth in the body of scientific knowledge. Although he denies the existence of scientific revolutions as Thomas Kuhn conceptualized, Scerri highly supports Kuhn’s concept of scientific progress not being teleological and there is no path toward an external truth.\nWhen Did Eric Scerri Release His First Book?\nHis first book on the periodic table won him the Newby McCoy Prize offered by the UCLA Chemistry Department. He was also voted one of Choice Magazine’s best academic books for that year. His second book on the topic was another choice academic book for the year. His latest book, “A Tale of Seven Elements,” was listed in the New Scientist magazine’s Top 12 science books of 2013. In addition to this, Scerri also released two collections of his selected research papers. As for the editor, he served on three books on the philosophy of chemistry and the elements. Till now, his books have been translated into twelve languages, and he is currently writing a new book on the rare earth elements. In 2019 and 2020, the second editions of Scerri’s two most referenced books were published.\nWhen Did Eric Scerri Appear on Radio and Television?\nScerri has appeared on radio and television and frequently lectures in countries all around the world. He has published over 100 articles in professional journals as well as more popular magazines, including Scientific American, American Scientist, New Scientist, Chemistry World, etc.\nWhat is Eric Scerri known for?\nHe is the author of The Periodic Table, Its Story, and Its Significance which several reviewers have called “the definitive book on the periodic table,” A Very Short Introduction to the Periodic Table, A Tale of Seven Elements, and most recently A Tale of Seven Scientists and A New Philosophy of Science.\nBooks\nHere is a list of all the books:\n- 2020, What is a Chemical Element?\n- 2020, The Periodic Table\n- 2019, The Periodic Table\n- 2018, Mendeleev to Oganesson\n- 2016, A Tale of Seven Scientists\n- 2016, Essays in the Philosophy of Chemistry\n- 2015, Philosophy of Chemistry\n- 2013, A tale of seven elements\n- 2013, 30-second elements\n- 2011, The periodic table: A very short introduction, Oxford University Press, Oxford, ISBN\n- 2009, Selected papers on the periodic table, Imperial College Press, London.\nArticles\n- 2023, A commentary on Robin Hendry’s views on molecular structure, emergence, and chemical bonding, in D.

He wrote many books about curries. His books are famous even among today’s generation. Chapman inherited a family interest in India, and curry in particular. He visited the subcontinent more than 40 times and set up the Curry Club.\nWhat was Chapman’s early life like?\nChapman was born in London on 20 December 1940. His father was in the Merchant Navy, and his mother was a midwifery training sister at Queen Charlotte’s Hospital in London and then ran a maternity nursing home in Ealing. He was educated at Bedales School, where he spent time on what the school called “Outdoor Work” at the school’s farm, working in the piggery and dairy.\nHe took a course at the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama. He worked backstage in London theatres and then became a stage manager at the Belgrade Theatre Coventry. He was a jet pilot in the Royal Air Force. He then spent six years in sales and marketing for Lesney Products, attending night school at Enfield Tech, studying business studies, and completing a diploma from the Chartered Institute of Marketing.\nEducational Background\nHe was accepted for a mature studentship at Fitzwilliam College, University of Cambridge, reading economics. Simultaneously, he founded the stage lighting and sound company Entec, which lit Cambridge May Balls in 1968 and liquid light shows for BBC Television in 1970 and 1971. In the 1970s, the company lit and supplied sound systems for many rock music bands. In 1979, Chapman’s investor, the Marquee Club’s Harold Pendleton, took over Entec. Chapman moved to Haslemere, Surrey, and spent the next four years as a consultant to entertainment groups on lighting and sound systems.\nHow did Chapman start his career?\nChapman often cooked curry, ran regular curry cookery courses, and took small groups of curry enthusiasts to India to visit a region and sample its cuisine. From 2008, Chapman was an active member of the Army Benevolent Fund committee, specifically to help with fundraising for their annual Big Curry event. He was commissioned by Cobra Beer for the 2010 National Curry Week celebrations to come up with recipes that spice up Britain’s favorite regional top dishes.\nFrom 2012, he was a trustee of the independent charity, the Cobra Foundation, supported by Molson Coors and Cobra Beer. The trust works to raise money for young people in South Asia by offering health, education, and community support. Chapman was a frequent face on British television, appearing on Who’ll Do the Pudding?, This Morning, Food and Drink, Great Food Live, and Good Food Live. He also had a regular spot on the Good Morning with Anne and Nick show.\nWhen was Chapman’s first book published?\nThe Indian Restaurant Cookbook happens to be the first book of Pat Chapman. It was published in 1984. This book has achieved enormous success worldwide. Moreover, it has become the cornerstone of a wide range of literary contributions to the culinary world.\nWhat awards did Pat Chapman receive?\nOn 17 November 2019, Chapman was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award at the Asian Curry Awards from the Asian Catering Federation, of which he is the longstanding Chairman of Judges. However, since he was too ill to attend in person, fellow judge George Shaw accepted the award on his\nbehalf saying, “Everyone who works in the curry sector owes Pat a huge debt and never has a Lifetime Achievement Award so well deserved.\nOn 22 November 2020, it was planned that Sanjay Anand of Madhu’s Caterers and Restaurants would present this Lifetime Achievement Award to Pat Chapman in conjunction with Yawar Khan, owner of Akash Tandoori Restaurant, Wallington, Surrey, and founder of The Asian Catering Federation and Awards. Due to COVID-19 this presentation was postponed because of the pandemic, and the award was delivered to Chapman’s home in Surrey.\nWhat is Pat Chapman best known for?\nChapman’s first cookery book, The Indian Restaurant Cookbook, was published in 1984 and is still in print. Chapman wrote some 36 books, with international sales exceeding 2 million copies. Most are on curry, but some of his other books cover cuisines such as Thai, Chinese, Middle Eastern, and international spicy cuisines. His Balti Cookbook was the first on the subject and became a Sunday Times Number 1 bestseller.\nHow many books has Pat Chapman written?\nPat Chapman has written a wide range of books.

  "https_samehhabeeb_uk_/https_samehhabeeb_uk_people_ealing-people_dusty-springfield-ealings-iconic-soulful-voice-and-her-journey-through-music/content_61.html": "Mary Isobel Catherine Bernadette O’Brien OBE (16 April 1939 – 2 March 1999) was an English and Irish singer, commonly known by her stage name Dusty Springfield. She was a popular singer of blue-eyed soul, pop, and dramatic ballads with French chanson, country, and jazz in her repertoire. During her 1960s peak, she ranked among the most successful British female performers on both sides of the Atlantic with her distinctive mezzo-soprano voice. Her image—peroxide-blonde bouffant/beehive hairstyles, heavy make-up (black eyeliner, eye shadow, and evening dresses), and stylized, gestural performances all made her the icon of the Swinging Sixties.\nCareer\nBorn in London’s West Hampstead to parents who loved their music, she learned to sing at home. In 1958, she first joined a professional group, namely the Lana Sisters. A full two years later, again with her brother Dion O’Brien (“Tom Springfield”) and Tim Field, she formed the folk-pop vocal trio the Springfields. Two of their five 1961–63 Top 40 UK “hits—”Island of Dreams” and “Say I Won’t Be There”—peaked at No. 5 on the charts, both in the spring of 1963. They also had success in the United States in 1962 with their cover of Silver Threads and Golden Needles.”.\nHer solo career started late in 1963 with the bright pop single “I Only Want to Be with You”—a UK No. 4 hit and the first of her six transatlantic Top 40 hits in the 1960s, along with “Stay Awhile” (1964), “All I See Is You” (1966), “I’ll Try Anything” (1967), and two releases that are now considered her signature songs: “You Don’t Have to Say You Love Me” (1966 UK No. 1/US No. 4) and “Son of a Preacher Man” (1968/69 UK No. 9/US No. 10). The latter is on the 1968 pop and soul album Dusty in Memphis, one of the defining works by Springfield. The US Library of Congress added the album to its National Recording Registry in March 2020. That registry preserves audio recordings considered “culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.”\nWas Dusty Springfield a heavy smoker?\nShe smoked two to three packs a day and drank too much, and with time the excesses caught up with her. In later life, her singles career went into eclipse, but she continued to tour and make records for other Elton John sets and the albums for Anne Murray. What’s Dusty Springfield’s biggest hit?\nI only write for the money—oh, mercenary creature!” The highest-charting of Springfield’s 1964 releases were both Burt Bacharach-Hal David songs: “Wishin’ and Hopin'”—a US no. 6 hit which featured on A Girl Called Dusty—and “I Just Don’t Know What to Do with Myself”, which in July peaked at no.\nWhy did Dusty Springfield stop singing?\nSpringfield was diagnosed with breast cancer while recording what would become her final album, 1995’s A Very Fine Love, and died of the disease in March 1999 at the age of 59.\nHow did Dusty Springfield offend Princess Margaret?\nShe had cracked a joke about the number of gay people at the concert, saying she was glad royalty wasn’t confined to the box, but Princess Margaret took it as a personal insult. Mortified, Dusty was then sent a typewritten message from the princess, which she was made to sign and return.\nWho inherited Dusty Springfield’s money?\nInstead, Trouble was cremated, and her remaining money went to the Helmsley Charitable Trust. Nicholas: When British singer Dusty Springfield died in 1999, she instructed that her money be used to care for her 13-year-old ragdoll cat.\nWhat happened to Dusty Springfield’s cat?\nDusty Springfield’s will, made after she died in 1999, bequeathed a testament to her affection for her beloved pet cat. The British late singer, who also had an unrelenting passion for animal rights, stated that her 13-year-old pedigree feline, Nicholas, should be fed baby food, especially imported to Britain from the United States.\nDid Dusty Springfield have bad eyesight?\nDusty does refer to her bad eyesight in one of the clips, and possibly Dusty wrote on her hands and arms as she learned her songs, but I did not think she used her arms for reference during her performance. To me, she was perfect.\nMusical style\nInfluenced by US pop music, Dusty Springfield created a distinctive blue-eyed soul sound. BBC News noted her soulful voice, at once strident and vulnerable, set her apart from her contemporaries. She was equally at home singing Broadway standards, blues, country, or even techno-pop.”. Allmusic’s Jason Ankeny described here:\nThe greatest white soul singer of her generation, a performer of remarkable emotional resonance whose body of work spans the decades and their attendant musical transformations with consistency and purity unmatched by any of her contemporaries; though a camp icon of glamorous excess in her towering beehive hairdo and panda-eye black mascara, the sultry intimacy and heartbreaking urgency of her voice transcended image and fashion, embracing everything from lushly orchestrated pop to gritty R&B to disco with unparalleled sophistication and depth.\nPersonal life\nSpringfield’s parents, Catherine and Gerard, resided in Hove, East Sussex, from 1962.

  "https_samehhabeeb_uk_/https_samehhabeeb_uk_people_ealing-people_william-willetts-legacy-in-ealing-the-father-of-british-summer-time/content_44.html": "William Willett, son of Farnham, Surrey, and born on August 10, 1856, was Britain’s finest builder and, in his time, British Summer Time savior. But this great fellow can only be recalled for his idea—dawn—its concept that underwent a metamorphosis within human thought patterns as well as usage.\nChildhood and Learning\nHe attended the Philological School. Having eventually apprenticed, after gaining some commerce, Willett began in his father’s company—now Willett Building Services—soon gaining an excellent reputation for quality houses in the wonderful locations of London and southeast England. Chelsea to Hove with a cheeky injection from Derwent House, much of life at Chislehurst, Kent. It was on a horseback ride one morning through Petts Wood that the inspiration came for British Summer Time. Here, many houses still had their blinds closed and were losing daylight.\nHistory\nAlthough Benjamin Franklin’s lighthearted satire in 1784 and ancient civilizations had earlier references, Willett’s modern innovation was important. His plan for Daylight Saving Time was much better organized and more comprehensive than any proposals that had come before. Willett proposes clocks advanced by 80 minutes in four incremental steps in April and reversed in September, maximizing daylight hours in the evening.\nAdvocacy and Implementation\nHe wrote the pamphlet “The Waste of Daylight” in 1907. Therein, he presented his proposals about saving daylight by moving the clocks. Willett advocated DST using his own money and also campaigned for the cause despite facing opposition from several sides. In 1908, he could convince Member of Parliament Robert Pearce. Robert Pearce went on to introduce the proposal to the British Parliament without ever achieving any success.\nWinston Churchill briefly supported it too, but in 1909, it was put on the agenda by a parliamentary select committee, and there was no proper action taken about it either. However, the start of World War I made energy conservation, especially with coal, essential; hence, by 1916, the bill finally became law under the Defense of the Realm Act. The clocks advanced one hour on 21 May 1916, and this became British Summer Time, although Willett was not around to see it turn into law.\nLegacy and Commemoration\nWilliam Willett died of pneumonia on 4 March 1915 at the age of 58. Despite dying much earlier than he would have wished, his legacy is left in many ways. There is a memorial sundial permanently mounted on DST in Petts Wood to commemorate him. The second one is the Daylight Inn located in Petts Wood, and the third, the Willett Way in Chislehurst, bears his name; lastly, he has a house with a blue plaque. He is buried in St. Nicholas’ Churchyard, Chislehurst, and his family memorial is in the churchyard of St. Wulfran’s Church, Ovingdean, Brighton, and Hove.\nFreemasonry\nWilliam Willett was a Freemason and was initiated to Camden Place Lodge on November 1, 1906.\nFamily\nHe was married twice. The first time was to Maria Mills in 1879, whom he had seven children with. In 1910, he was married to Florence Strickland, with whom he had one daughter. His legacy is in his family, and John Willett, who has translated the works of Bertolt Brecht, and Chris Martin, lead singer of Coldplay, a great-great-grandson of William Willett.\nWhat did William Willett contribute to history?\nThere is a man named William Willett credited with the concept of British Summer Time, suggesting that clocks should be advanced in summer to make the most out of daylight.\nWhen was the British Summer Time enacted?\nThe British Summer Time was enacted on 21 May 1916 under the Defence of the Realm Act during World War I.\nWhy did Willett propose daylight saving time?\nAccording to Willett, it would save the energy spent on artificial lighting in the evenings by moving the clocks forward and making more use of daylight during the evenings for leisure activities.\nWas Benjamin Franklin the inventor of DST?\nFranklin had proposed getting up earlier when daylight was available. However, it was a much more elaborate plan by William Willett that gave rise to the modern version of DST.\nWhat Was the Motive of William Willett for the DST?\nNo, William Willett died in 1915, before Britain formally adopted DST in 1916.\nWhere is William Willett celebrated?\nHe is celebrated with a memorial sundial set to DST at Petts Wood, a road named Willett Way, The Daylight Inn at Petts Wood, and a blue plaque outside his former house in Chislehurst.\nWas Willett a Freemason?\nYes, William Willett was initiated into Camden Place Lodge on November 1, 1906.\nWhat influence did World War I have on the adoption of DST?\nPressure to save energy during the war, particularly saving coal, accelerated the adoption of British Summer Time. It became an important wartime measure.\nHow much daylight did Willett want to save?\nHe recommended moving the clocks forward by 80 minutes in four 20-minute steps. This would have conserved the evenings for recreation and saved lighting bills of around £2.5 million.",

  "https_samehhabeeb_uk_/https_samehhabeeb_uk_people_ealing-people_rupa-huq-from-ealing-to-parliamentthe-journey-of-a-trailblazing-politician/content_92.html": "Rupa Huq is a popular British politician, born in Ealing, who has made massive strides in the political arena. She is an MP for the Labour Party, and her most notable work in the political arena is on social justice and education issues, for which she has gained recognition for being vocal and working for public service.\nEarly Life and Education\nRupa Huq was born on 2 April 1972 in Queen Charlotte’s Hospital, Hammersmith, and grew up on Brunswick Road in Ealing. Huq’s father, Muhammad Huq, and mother, Rowshan Ara Huq, moved to Britain in 1962 from East Pakistan.\nHuq’s father came from Maksedpur in Pabna, and her mother from Kuthipara in Pabna. Huq’s father was training to become an actuary for Prudential but gave that up to open an Indian restaurant in Soho, London. After the recession of the early 1990s, the council did not renew the restaurant’s lease so the business folded.\nShe graduated in 1993 with an upper second in Political and Social Sciences and Law from Newnham College, Cambridge, for a BA. She then finished a PhD in cultural studies at the University of East London, completed in 1999 with a thesis on youth culture, comparing young people in East London and the Alsace region of France.\nWriting and Media Career\nHuq has written for Tribune, The Guardian, New Statesman, Progress magazine, and The Times Higher Education Supplement. Huq’s specialization of research has mainly been youth culture and pop music. She is specifically interested in David Bowie.\nHer book on these subjects, published in 2006, Beyond Subculture: Youth, Pop, and Identity in a Post-Colonial World, was published. It was one of five titles shortlisted for the 2007 British Sociological Association Philip Abrams Memorial Prize. 9, 14 Huq was a contributor to the 2011 book What Next for Labour? Ideas for a new Generation, published by Queensferry Publishing.\nEarly Political Career\n-\n- Huq worked as a researcher for Tony Banks and Patricia Hewitt. In 2004, she stood as a Labour candidate in the European Parliament election for North West England but failed.\n-\n- In 2005, she was the Labour parliamentary candidate for Chesham and Amersham at the 2005 general election. She came third with 14% of the vote, behind the incumbent Conservative MP Cheryl Gillan and the Liberal Democrat candidate.\n-\n- In 2008, she was a member of a UK government Foreign and Commonwealth “Understanding Islam” delegation to Bangladesh.\n-\n- In 2010, Huq was one of three Labour candidates for a council seat in Walpole in the constituency of Ealing, though she failed to be elected.\nWhy Was Rupa Huq Suspended from the Labour Party?\nIn September 2022, Huq was accused of racist comments in a speech at a Labour Party fringe event running parallel to the party conference. On the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kwasi Kwarteng, Huq said, “Superficially he is a black man… if you hear him on the Today Programme, you wouldn’t know he is Black.” In response, figures within the Conservative Party, including its chairman, demanded the whip be removed from Huq and her expulsion from the Labour Party.\nLabour’s Deputy Leader Angela Rayner called on Huq to apologize, saying her comments were “unacceptable. Labour Mayor of London and friend of Huq, Sadiq Khan, also criticized her statement, saying, “What it infers is that all black people speak a certain way and all black people are working class.\nBrexit\nIn May 2017, Huq said, “I am an MP who is a resolute Remainer. I will continue to fight for the UK to stay in the EU and vote accordingly. For me, this is respecting the will of the people in Ealing, Acton, and Chiswick.”\nApril 2018 For Business Insider, Huq wrote: “Brexit is not carved into concrete, untouchable and unchangeable”, and added: “If the cost of Brexit reaches a point where the British people decide it’s not worth it, then they’re perfectly entitled to change their minds about whether it’s the right path”.\nIn December 2018, she accused UK Prime Minister Theresa May of having “a sort of premature parliamentary ejaculation—that has put the lie to the claim that she sticks to her guns” over her decision to delay a parliamentary vote on the government’s Brexit deal. May retorted, “I think she will see that I am not capable of a parliamentary ejaculation,” prompting raucous laughter in the House of Commons.\nWhat are Rupa Huq’s views on housing in the UK?\nIn 2022, Huq spoke out against a plan to construct a 26-storey mixed-use development, which was meant to host 477 homes—half of them affordable housing—near the Ealing Broadway train station in London. At the meeting of the Ealing planning committee, she stated, “A 26-story tower, out of all character with low-density Ealing, plonked there despite local opposition, sticking out like a sore thumb, marketed to international investors on our public land—really? Good job, #doublingdownon Ealing.” Before the local elections, she mentioned that people do not want to live in flats and that “the skyline will be ruined forever.” After this, Ealing Council scrapped the plans for the building and decided on retrofitting the existing 6-story building.\nA-Level History Teaching\nIn January 2018, Huq stated that the A Level history syllabus, Britain 1930 to 1997, was biased against Labour because it omitted the 1945–51 Labour government, ends just before Tony Blair’s Labour government in 1997, and asks pupils to list Conservative strengths and Labour weaknesses.\nIn February, in a personal film for the Daily Politics series, Huq said it was “dangerous to deny that these things, the Blair–Brown administrations, or the post-war Labour government that brought in the welfare state and National Health Service, ever happened,” and she argued there was a pro-Conservative bias to what was being taught with a risk of “brainwashing our kids.”.\nIs Rupa Huq married?\nRup Huq got married in 2003 and had a son in 2004. Her elder sister is an architect, and her older sister is Konnie Huq, a former Blue Peter presenter. and brother-in-law is Konnie Huq’s husband, the satirist and screenwriter Charlie Brooker.

  "https_samehhabeeb_uk_/https_samehhabeeb_uk_people_ealing-people_spencer-perceval-ealings-prime-ministerhis-life-legacy-and-assassination/content_72.html": "Spencer Perceval was born on 1 November 1762 and died on 11 May 1812. He was a British statesman and barrister who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from October 1809 until his assassination in May 1812. He is the only British prime minister to have been assassinated and the only solicitor-general or attorney-general to have become prime minister\nChildhood and Education\nHe was born at Audley Square, Mayfair, London, the seventh son of the 2nd Earl of Egmont, the second son of the Earl’s second marriage. His mother was Catherine Compton, Baroness Arden, a grandchild of the 4th Earl of Northampton. Spencer was a Compton family name; Catherine Compton’s great-uncle Spencer Compton, 1st Earl of Wilmington, had been prime minister.\nHis father was a political adviser to Frederick, Prince of Wales, and King George III, having served briefly in the cabinet as First Lord of the Admiralty—early childhood at Charlton House, which his father had taken to be near Woolwich Dockyard.\nEgmont, Perceval’s father, died when he was eight. Perceval attended Harrow School, which he found demanding, and he worked hard. At Harrow, he became interested in evangelical Anglicanism and developed a lifelong friendship with Dudley Ryder. He stayed for five years at Harrow and then joined his older brother Charles at Trinity College, Cambridge. There he gained the declamation prize in English and graduated in 1782.\nLegal Career and Marriage\nAs a younger son of a younger marriage, Perceval had only £200 a year; without inheritance, he had to look to his resources for an income. Perceval read for the law at Lincoln’s Inn and entered the bar in 1786. In the same year that Perceval’s mother died in 1783, he and his brother Charles, who had been promoted to the dignity of Lord Arden, let a house at Charlton, and there fell in love with two sisters who had been living in the Percevals’ childhood home.\nThe sisters’ father, Sir Thomas Spencer Wilson, approved of the match between his eldest daughter, Margaretta, and the wealthy Lord Arden, a member of Parliament and a lord of the Admiralty. Perceval, who at that time was an impecunious barrister on the Midland Circuit, was told to wait until three years had passed and the younger daughter, Jane, came of age.\nIn 1790, at the age of 21, Jane was in no better circumstances than when they first met: Perceval’s career had not yet started to prosper, and Sir Thomas continued to oppose the marriage. They eloped, marrying by special license in East Grinstead, and set up home together in lodgings over a carpet shop in Bedford Row, later in Lindsey House, Lincoln’s Inn Fields.\nWho was the British Prime Minister in 1809-1812?\nThree of its members would go on to become prime ministers: Perceval, Lord Hawkesbury, and George Canning. Another two of the great statesmen of the 19th century sat with Portland: Lord Eldon and Lord Castlereagh. But Portland was an ineffectual leader, and health was failing. Summer in 1809 cut the country to its political knees as Canning conspired against Castlereagh, and the Duke of Portland resigned after a stroke.\nThe negotiations to have a new prime minister began; Canning wanted either the prime ministership or nothing, while Perceval was willing to work under someone else, not Canning. The remnants of the cabinet resolved to request that Lord Grey and Lord Grenville come forward to “an extended and combined administration” in which Perceval would like to work as the home secretary. However, Grenville and Grey declined to accede to discuss anything with them, and the King accepted the Cabinet’s suggestion of Perceval as his new prime minister.\nHe kissed the King’s hands on 4 October and set about forming his cabinet. The task was made more difficult by the fact that both Castlereagh and Canning had ruled themselves out of consideration by fighting a duel. Having received five refusals for the office, Perceval had to serve as his own Chancellor of the Exchequer—characteristically declining to accept the salary\nWhy was Spencer Perceval assassinated?\nAt 5:15 pm, on the evening of 11 May 1812, Perceval was on his way to attend the inquiry into the Orders in Council. As he entered the lobby of the House of Commons, a man stepped forward, drew a pistol, and shot him in the chest. Perceval fell to the floor after uttering something that was variously heard as “murder” and “oh my God.”.\nThese were his last words. He had been carried into an adjoining room and propped up on a table with his feet on two chairs by the time he was senseless, although there was still a faint pulse. Within a few minutes, a pulse was no longer detected, and Perceval was pronounced dead by the surgeon\nHe was buried on 16 May 1812 in the Egmont vault at St Luke’s Church, Charlton, London. He was buried privately, as requested by his widow. The pallbearers were Lord Eldon, Lord Liverpool, Lord Harrowby, and Richard Ryder. The day before, Bellingham had been tried, and, when asked to enter a plea of insanity, he refused and was found guilty and sentenced to death.

He was an English cricket player who played the game domestically at the level for teams like Bengal Governor’s XI in the season of 1930/31 and Devon during the year 1928. During Smythe’s short first-class cricket career, he appeared in only one match. He was at 3.50 with the bat, 7 runs on board, best of 6 runs. While bowling, he delivered 54 balls and gained 1 wicket with 19.00 being the average, the best being 1/9. Throughout his career, Smythe neither attained any five-wicket hauls nor participated in ten-wicket matches neither had catches or stumping under his belt.\nWho Was Ernest Smythe?\nErnest Meade Smythe was an English cricketer and Indian Army officer whose life spanned several dimensions of service and sport. Though details on his batting and bowling styles are unknown, Smythe made significant contributions to cricket. A native of Ealing, Middlesex, England, Smythe received his early education at the Allhallows School in Devon.\nEarly Cricket Life\nHe first played for Devon in the 1928 Minor Counties Championship. In the only game he played for his team, he played three matches against Kent Second XI and Surrey Second XI as well as against Cornwall. That alone increased his popularity and status among the English domestic cricket fraternity and that’s where his career came to an end. Ernest started his career with a lot of talent. He has been an icon for many generations.\nFirst-Class Cricket\nIn November 1930, Smythe played only one first-class match for the Bengal Governor’s XI against Maharaj Kumar of Vizianagram’s XI at Eden Gardens, Calcutta. His play in this game reflected both the promise and problems that cricketers faced during early 20th-century India. In the first innings of Bengal Governor’s XI, Smythe managed to score only 1 run and was dismissed by Ghulam Mohammad. In the second innings, he scored 6 runs before being dismissed by Mushtaq Ali.

During his only first-class game, Smythe did not get any five-wicket hauls or ten-wicket matches.\nService in the Military\nThe World War II break brought Smythe out of cricket into military service. In February 1942, he was drafted into the Indian Army on an emergency commission and became a 2nd Lieutenant. This formed a very important chapter in his life, during which he gained great repute outside the cricketing field.\nLater Life and Legacy\nErnest Meade Smythe died on 9 July 1975 at St Columb Major, Cornwall, England. Even though the cricketing career of Ernest Meade Smythe was short, it follows the history of early 20th-century cricketers who worked on and off the ground, with the weight of change facing them in the world around them.\nWhat was the role of Ernest Meade Smythe in cricket?\nErnest Meade Smythe was an English cricketer who played for Minor Counties Championship and had a very short first-class career, playing for Bengal Governor’s XI in just one game during the 1930/31 season.

Despite this, Habeeb remains steadfast in advocating for systemic reform within the utility sector, particularly in light of community-specific concerns.\nRecent reports highlighting water quality issues in Ealing underscore the critical importance of robust oversight and accountability in water management. As constituents voice apprehensions regarding water safety and environmental integrity, Habeeb asserts the necessity of renationalising Thames Water to prioritize public welfare over profit-driven interests, especially in the wake of Labour’s retraction on broader nationalisation plans.\nLabour’s reconsideration of its nationalisation pledge, as announced by Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves, has raised eyebrows and prompted criticism from grassroots campaigners and independent candidates like Habeeb.\nThe abandonment of the idea of renationalising critical services reflects a disconnect between political promises and the pressing needs of communities, particularly those facing environmental challenges like Ealing North.\nAcross Ealing, there has also been constant issues of pollution of local rivers and campaigners have also challenged Thames Water, the Government and Ealing Council to take action.\nLocal campaigning group Clean Up The River Brent (CURB) has been monitoring the situation on a regular basis. In September 2022 they launched a “Save the eels of Ealing!” campaign having noticed unusual smells and debris in the river which was impacting species in the river but smells and debris has been continuing.\nLabour’s retreat from its nationalisation pledge underscores the evolving landscape of political discourse surrounding public ownership and utility services. The general consensus across the country is in favour of renationalising many services as privatisation proved to be not working.\nWhile the party retreats from its commitment to nationalise energy, water, and mail, Habeeb reaffirms his dedication to championing the cause of renationalisation, rooted in the principles of community empowerment and social responsibility. He will continue to advocate for this crucial cause and if elected as an MP of Ealing North he will ensure to become vocal campaigner at the House of Commons.\nBy integrating local concerns into the broader discourse on renationalisation, Habeeb’s campaign resonates with constituents who demand meaningful action to safeguard essential services.\nAs the voice of Ealing North residents, Habeeb pledges to advocate tirelessly for water quality improvements and systemic reform, ensuring that community interests remain at the forefront of policy discussions.",
  "https_samehhabeeb_uk_/https_samehhabeeb_uk_people_ealing-people_james-alphege-brewer-legacy-of-a-renowned-ealing-artist-and-etcher/content_112.html": "James Alphege Brewer (1881-1946) was a well-known early 20th-century producer of color etchings. He is known for his etchings of European cathedrals and other scenes of churches, colleges, and communities. He was born in Kensington, London. He was the son of Henry William Brewer, a noted artist of architectural history, and his great uncle was E. Cobham Brewer (1810-1897), the polymath who compiled Brewer’s Dictionary of Phrase and Fable. Talent ran in his family, and he was inspired to do better each day. Many aspiring painters are taking inspiration from his work.\nWho was James Alphege Brewer?\nJames Brewer was born on 24 July 1881, in Kensington, London, the son of Henry William Brewer, a noted artist of historical architecture. His brothers included the painter Henry Charles Brewer and the novelist and organist John Francis Brewer. Their grandfather was the historian John Sherren Brewer, and their great uncle was E. Cobham Brewer, compiler of Brewer’s Dictionary of Phrase & Fable.\nWhat was the background of James Brewer?\nThe father and grandfather, John Sherren Brewer, of the brewer, were notable adherents of the Oxford Movement inspired by Augustus Pugin. Henry William Brewer and his family, including James Alphege Brewer, became high-profile converts to the Roman Catholic Church. His brothers had prominent careers that involved being painters. While the other one became a novelist. The family of James inspired him in many ways. His exemplary work is appreciated by one generation after the other.\nWho Did James Alphege Brewer Marry?\nOn 23 July 1910, Brewer marries Florence née Lucas at Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church in Acton. Florence was a talented painter and great-niece of David Lucas (engraver), who made engravings for John Constable. Brewer and his wife, Florence Lucas, resided on Avenue Road in Acton during their marriage. Henry Charles Brewer also resided in Acton, and the brothers worked together on many pictures.\nWhere did James Brewer exhibit his work?\nLike his brother Henry Charles Brewer, Brewer attended St Charles Catholic College in Kensington before studying at the Westminster School of Art with Frederick Brown. He was an exhibitor at the Royal Academy of Art and later at the Royal Institute of Painters in Watercolour, at the Paris Salon of the Académie des Beaux-Arts, and in the shows of the Royal Cambrian Academy.\nHe also formed part of the Society of Graphic Art and the Ealing Art Group, where he served first as Honorary Art Secretary and later as Honorary Art Chairman. Brewer is considered to be the inspiration for his brother Henry Charles’s wall paintings designed for the Lady Chapel of St. Peter’s Church, Ealing, in 1928. Brewer’s etching, a gift in 2023, is also there in the chapel. Among his older siblings were the artist Henry Charles Brewer and the organist and writer John Francis Brewer (1864-1921).\nThe Most Famous Etchings\nIt is almost impossible to date the etchings produced in the Acton studio that did not find a publisher with Alfred Bell & Co. One pointer might be that Brewer, in his datable etchings, started engraving the title into the plate in 1926. Although by no means absolute, this was a good point to start grouping the etchings into earlier and later periods. Most of the etchings thought to be from the later period were less than 50 square inches in area. A 1925 sales booklet, which appears to have been published by Brewer specifically for the American market, is useful in this dating by order.\nCharacteristics of Later Brewer Etchings\nSome of Brewer’s etchings became so popular that they required new versions when demand exceeded the size of a limited edition. This led to two very nearly identical views of Antwerp and its cathedral across the Scheldt and two views of St. Paul’s Cathedral across the Thames, the two pairs again showing minor adjustments in angle or attire. At least six more depict the west front of the Cathedral of Notre Dame in Rheims at varying angles or modes of dress.\nOne was published in 1919 with what looks to be a peasant woman in traditional dress in the foreground. A very similar view, but with short-skirted tourists, was published in 1928. Two other views date from 1916 and 1921: one straight-on view with tourists, signed by both James and Henry and another from about two yards to the right with figures in traditional dress\nProfessional Success\nBrewier’s first important success as a young artist came with color etchings in commemoration of cathedrals and other edifices destroyed or damaged during World War I. During World War II, however, he turned his back on the war, producing instead woodcuts of scenes of natural beauty—mountain and pastoral scenes, for the most part, in the Japanese manner.\nDid James Alphege Brewer collaborate with other artists?\nYes, Brewer collaborated with his brother, Henry Charles Brewer, who was also a painter. They worked together on many pictures and projects, including the wall paintings for the Lady Chapel of St. Peter’s Church in Ealing, created by Henry Charles in 1928.\nWhat contribution did Brewer make to the Society of Graphic Art?\nBrewer took an active role in the Society of Graphic Art, which was created to promote printmaking. He was a member of the Honorary Art Secretary and then the Honorary Art Chairman of the Ealing Art Group.\nWhere is James Alphege Brewer buried?\nBrewer died on 4 February 1946 at the age of 64.

  "https_samehhabeeb_uk_/https_samehhabeeb_uk_people_ealing-people_william-george-barker/content_123.html": "William George Barker (18 January 1868- 6 November 1951, in Wimbledon) was a British film producer, director, cinematographer, and entrepreneur who took film-making in Britain from a low-budget form of novel entertainment to the heights of lavishly produced epics that were matched only by Hollywood for quality and style. He was immensely respected for his dedication and hard work. His work has been exemplary, and new generations aspire to be like him.\nEarly career\nHis early career was that of a commercial traveler. He was successful enough at that that he was able to indulge an interest in photography. In 1901 he started a business at 50 Gray’s Inn Road, Holborn, to make moving pictures on a hand-cranked Lumiere camera, which he had bought a few years before, and then show the resulting films to the public—for a fee. This was the Autoscope Company. Like the early Mitchell and Kenyon films, the genre was mainly ‘topical,’ for they require the least amount of preparation and expense. On 1 January 1906, it merged with the Warwick Trading Company with Barker as the managing director.\nBirth of Ealing Studios\nHaving left Warwick, he set up Barker Motion Photography Limited in December 1909 at Number 1 Soho Square, Westminster, London. Now he wanted to shoot the film using set stages regardless of the weather. Having already purchased a house called “The Lodge,” Ealing (now renamed the White Lodge, Ealing Studios) overlooking Ealing Green, he procured the adjacent property two years later in 1904. This second house was set back from Ealing Green behind a school on the west side and was therefore known as the West Lodge. He had 3.8 acres (1.5 ha) of land, so plenty of room to put in stages. He did build three.\nThere are two remarkable ways in which early Edwardian Ealing reminds one of Ealing today. It still looks magnificent—’Queen’of the Suburbs’ is an appropriate title for it – and in the words of one writer, “it still isn’t Hollywood.” Hence, the initial stages were constructed with very high glass walls and roofs to take maximum advantage of the light available while keeping out the British weather. By 1912 this had become the largest film studio in Britain and possibly Europe. Many productions were released under his trademark of Bulldog Films.\nBreaking Boundaries: Challenges in the American Market\nAt that time British cinema started facing two important problems. One was the restrictive practices of the new Motion Picture Patents Company that prevented English films from reaching audiences in America. International films have been dominating the screens in America so far. This cartel effectively capped a ceiling on the receipts that English filmmakers could aspire to derive for their investment. Secondly, film print copies were purchased outright by the distributor. This meant that a popular film would not earn the filmmaker any more than an unsuccessful one.\nHowever, it also meant that the audiences had no choice but to see ever-degrading prints that had become ever more scratched through repeated use. As more and more frames were lost due to multiple re-splicing and general damage, the action would unexpectedly jump forward whilst the film was being watched. The first matter he tried to address was by coming to America to attend the International Projecting and Producing Company meeting of February 1909, held to voice support. This institution had been instituted in a foolish attempt to usurp the leadership of the cartel.\nRevolutionizing Film Distribution\nHe then embarked on making the movie-going experience for the masses much better by promoting films that came out on a hire-only basis. The first film for hire has only today been deemed to be the first significant British film. It is so, despite no prints of this film existing.\nCinematic Milestones: Henry VIII and Sixty Years a Queen\nThe film was an opulent adaptation of Henry VIII. Barker even used some of the original stage sets from Her Majesty’s Theatre. He was reported to have paid Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree (who was the actor/manager of the before-said theatre) £1,000 for doing his interpretation of Cardinal Wolsey for the film. After being shown to record audiences, the total film stock was ceremoniously burnt before the press to promote hired films as a way of ensuring the public saw only good quality stock whilst at the same time maximizing his profits by maintaining control of the prints.\nPartnerships That Shaped Cinema\nAnother entrepreneur and film distributor called G.B. Samuelson convinced Barker to make what would be another very important British film: Sixty Years a Queen (1913), about the life of Victoria. Samuelson also heavily financed the production of this film and so further increased his fortune through its success. After Barker made his last films in the 1920s, Samuelson went on in 1924 to found the SouthHall Film Studio, just 4 miles (6.4 km) west in a converted aircraft hangar that stood on Gladstone Road.\nUnfortunately, both studios then suffered from the recession. He died on 6 November 1951 in Wimbledon, London. In 2001 after many changes of ownership at Ealing Studios, Ealing Council approved planning permission to demolish the West Lodge as part of a major new studio development project; the original Lodge survives as studio offices.\nList of films\n-\n- Beerbohm Tree as Cardinal Wolsey\n-\n- Short Films:\n-\n- The Child Stealers (1904)\n-\n- Topicals:\n-\n- London Day by Day (1906)\n-\n- Film Series:\n-\n- Cape to Cairo (1907).\n-\n- Feature films:\n-\n- Henry VIII (1911)\n-\n- screen composer: Edward German\n-\n- East Lynne (1913)\n-\n- Sixty Years a Queen (1913)\n-\n- B&W: Eight reels / 7500 feet\n-\n- Format: standard 35 mm spherical 1.37:1\n-\n- Director: Bert Haldane.\nCast:\nBlanche Forsythe, Mrs. Lytton, J.

She is an English actress from Ealing, London. With her in your shows, her striking performances in film and television have gained international fame. People are well aware of Princess Claude in “Reign” and Charlotte Heywood in “Sanditon.”. Nowadays, she is just becoming one of the most flexible and dedicated actresses.\nEarly Life and Education\nWilliams was raised in the colorful borough of Ealing in West London, where she is embedded in creativity. “My mother worked as a costume designer and my father as a gardener—the best combination any child could be lucky enough to have,” says Williams.\nHow Did Rose Williams Get into Acting?\nAt the age of 17, she was given a chance to attend her first true employment at Dover Street Market, the high-class street fashion retailer, which defined her interest in fashion design. Again, yet requiring a need for a storytelling performance, she continued on her career path to becoming an actress at age 18 and set off to establish her grand and remarkable career, both on-screen and within the theater.\nWhat nationality is Rose Williams?\nBorn and bred in Ealing, Rose Victoria Williams is fast turning out to be a power force in the entertainment industry. From “Reign” to “Sanditon,” in which she played major roles, there had been no way she could be ignored or overlooked by those who identify potential talent and dedication.\nWhether the adventurous princess or the practical-minded Austen heroine, Williams just keeps on torching television and screen. That being said, fans continue waiting for her next endeavor, feeling in their bones the star within has only yet gotten brighter.\nEarly Career\nThe first acting experience Williams had was back in 2014 when she guest-starred as an actress in the medical drama television show “Casualty,” which gave her a shot to act out as Imogen Renfrew in the episode “Unhinged.” That proved to be the springboard into further works for her, including historical and genre-specific works:\nWhat role did Rose Williams play in Reign?\n“Reign” (2014–2017): She played the feisty, multidimensional role of Princess Claude during the series’ second to fourth seasons in the CW’s historical period drama series about life in 16th-century France. It forced her to spend three years living in Toronto, Canada, while submerging herself completely into a complicated web of royal politics and intrigue.\n“Medici” (2019): There she played Caterina Sforza Riario in this historical drama series during its third season. She came to be that actress who can portray the historic characters in life.\n“Curfew” (2019): There, she played Faith Palladino in this series. It is a dystopian action series that makes her roster more versatile and wide.\nSuccess with “Sanditon”\nWilliams’ career soared when she played the lead in “Sanditon” (2019–2023), an adaptation of Jane Austen’s unwritten novel. As Charlotte Heywood, an independent and inquisitive young woman whose life contours around navigating the complexities of Regency society, Williams enchanted viewers with her charm and emotional depth.\nAs “Sanditon” introduced audiences to the umpteen talent of Williams, the fame of this rising star for British television blossomed.\nFilm Career\nWilliams quickly found her place in the cinema and, with many good performances:\n- “Chicken” (2015): Here she acted with Lil, where both her vulnerable and strongest sides are seen.\n- “A Quiet Passion” (2016): Here Williams plays young Vinnie Dickinson in a biographical drama about the life of poet Emily Dickinson.\n- “Changeland” (2019): She co-stars with Seth Green and Macaulay Culkin in this coming-of-age drama. Here, she deepens the character of Emma.\n- “The Power” (2021): There is Valerie, one of the leads, and Pamela plays a nurse fighting supernatural powers in this British horror, set in London in the 1970s.\n- “Mrs. Harrison Goes to Paris” (2022): She plays the supporting character Pamela Penrose opposite Lesley Manville in this warm, funny tale about ambition and fashion.\n- “Locked In” (2023): She plays Lina in this thriller that hits on all cylinders.\nTelevision Highlights\nApart from movies, Williams is also wonderfully featured on the small screen.\n- “That Dirty Black Bag” (2022): There, again, Williams showed her versatility in portraying Symone\n- “Sanditon” (2019-2023): The role of Charlotte Heywood in this is that one ‘career-defining performance’, which represents wit and strength like a stereotypical heroine of Austen.\nAchievements\nWilliams has handled a transition from a drama history to the thriller of current times with not even one stumble. Such ability to come up with a complex character coupled with sheer devotion to work has made Williams a favorite as well as a critic.\nFilm\n- 2015: Chicken-Lil\n- 2016: A Quiet Passion—Young Vinnie Dickinson\n- 2016: Infinite—Lily (Short Film)\n- 2019: Changeland – Emma\n- 2021: The Power—Valerie / Val\n- 2022: Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris—Pamela Penrose\n- 2023: Locked In—Lina\nTelevision\n- 2014: Casualty – Imogen Renfrew (Episode: “Unhinged”)\n- 2014-2017: Reign-Claude de Valois (Seasons 2–4)\n- 2019: Curfew – Faith Palladino\n- 2019-2023: Sanditon—Charlotte Heywood (Main Character)\n- 2019: Medici—Caterina Sforza Riario (Season 3)\n- 2022: That Dirty Black Bag—Symone (Season 1)\nFuture Prospects and Legacy\nIndeed, the future for Rose Victoria Williams is bright as she moves up the ladder in her career. She is known for playing a wide range of characters and has become the most sought-after talent in both British and international productions.\nHer performances in period drama “Sanditon” or in a movie like “Locked In” feature her wide-ranging and total commitment to their craft. This pays off whenever segments of the different viewership can find her appealing, as well as this dedication to making a role convincingly real and fully fleshed.\nIn the future, Williams will venture into new genres and work with visionary filmmakers that will further entrench her as a force to be reckoned with in the entertainment industry. Her legacy has already begun with her impactful roles, inspiring up-and-coming actors and holding audiences worldwide spellbound.",

  "https_samehhabeeb_uk_/https_samehhabeeb_uk_people_ealing-people_leonard-shuffrey-ealings-master-of-victorian-and-edwardian-aesthetic-architecture/content_62.html": "Leonard Shuffrey (31 March 1852 – 27 December 1926) was a British architect and architectural designer of the late Victorian and Edwardian periods. He was a leading figure of the aesthetic movement, which had a significant impact on the development of buildings, their interiors, and their settings in London and the South of England.\nNoted for his wallpaper, fireplaces, and ornate plasterwork, Shuffrey was considered William Morris’s equal in his creativity and skill as a craftsman. His output is often found in decorative schemes with William Morris, Edward Ould, William De Morgan, and other preeminent Arts & Crafts and late Pre-Raphaelite decorative artists of the day\nWhere Was Leonard Shuffrey Born?\nLeonard Atkinson Shuffrey was born on 31 March 1852 in Wood Green, Witney, Oxfordshire, of an old Wood Green family of blanket weavers and tanners of Huguenot origin, who had lived at 7 Narrow Hill since the early eighteenth century.\nHis parents were Samuel Shuffrey (1810–1889) and Sarah Shuffrey, née Baylis (1819–1875). Among seven children, Shuffrey was the older brother of the renowned watercolor painter James Allen Shuffrey. Leonard’s cousin is the Revd William Shuffrey (1851–1932), who served as Vicar of Arncliffe and Honorary Canon of Ripon Cathedral. Leonard Shuffrey was educated at Bloxham School between 1856 and 1867.\nHow Many Times Did Leonard Shuffrey Marry?\nShuffrey’s first marriage, in 1873, was to Sarah Fletcher, a relative of Banister Fletcher (senior), with whom he had a son named Leonard. Leonard senior’s second wife, whom he married in 1877 after the death of Sarah, was Martha Carey, great-granddaughter of James Hardy, relative of Admiral Sir Thomas Hardy, Captain of the Victory. Leonard and Martha had two sons, Gilbert (born 1891) and Paul Shuffrey (born 1889), and a daughter, Kathleen (b. 1899). All of Shuffrey’s sons attended St. Paul’s School in London.\nWallpaper\nShuffrey’s wallpaper was considered to be the second-best invention, next only to William Morris and the craftsman who invented it. His company produced it in Herne Hill, South London, where the paper was printed with wooden blocks.\nShuffrey & Co. produced many sample books of their wallpaper designs. The second book was launched in 1886 with The Builder Magazine, praising the “simplicity and lack of ostentation” of the designs, adding, “Architects will be glad to have this book.”.\nAnother book appeared in 1891. The paper was clever but plain in ornament; it could be printed in chocolate browns, greens, and buffs and was appreciated for its ingenuity and cheapness by the ordinary householder.\nFireplaces\nFireplace design allowed Shuffrey to use most materials, and every fireplace was treated as a separate piece of decorative work. They were much used by leading architects, who appreciated the quality of Shuffrey’s drawings and were willing to rely on his judgment. Fireplaces provided a central occupation of Shuffrey’s lifetime, and his showrooms were filled with interesting examples in wood and metal, “amongst which he moved like a curator in a museum, loving to explain memorable facts about them.”. Shuffrey wrote his book, The English Fireplace, published by Batsford in 1912, which became required reading for architects and designers\nCeilings\nShuffrey & Co. also designed and made decorated ceilings, mainly in ‘fibrous’ plasterwork but also in wood. In 1893, Shuffrey was commissioned to create ceilings at Wightwick Manor near Wolverhampton, which was under construction by Edward Ould for Theodore Mander, of the Mander family. The billiard and dining room ceilings he produced are in the Jacobean style with pendants and with ornate friezes below. Other artists and designers commissioned to decorate and furnish the old English-style manor were Charles Eamer Kempe, who designed stained glass windows, and William Morris\nTiles\nNot much is known about Shuffrey’s tiles. Luster tiles were designed by Shuffrey & Co. in the manner of William de Morgan and William Morris. Only two transfer-printed tile designs were registered by Shuffrey in addition to a range of molded designs. Shuffrey’s tiles were probably made on blanks by Maw & Co. Shuffrey & Co. tiles and glazed fireplaces were employed in the restoration of two staircases at Brasenose College in 1885, in addition to tiles by William Morris and William De Morgan.\nDeath\nShuffrey died on Monday, 27 December 1926, at Thorncote, the house he had built in Ealing almost 40 years earlier. His funeral was held at St. Peter’s Church, Ealing, on Friday, 31 December, and he was buried in Witney.

  "https_samehhabeeb_uk_/https_samehhabeeb_uk_people_ealing-people_fred-perry-the-legendary-tennis-icon-from-ealinga-journey-through-triumphs-and-legacy/content_90.html": "Fred Perry (18 May 1909–2 February 1995) was a British tennis and table tennis player and former world No. 1 from England who won 10 Majors, including eight Grand Slam tournaments and two Pro Slam singles titles, as well as six Major doubles titles. Perry won three consecutive Wimbledon Championships from 1934 to 1936 and was the world amateur number one tennis player during those three years. Before Andy Murray in 2013, Perry was the last British player to win the men’s Wimbledon championship, in 1936, and the last British player to win a men’s singles Grand Slam title, until Andy Murray won the 2012 US Open.\nWhere Was Fred Perry Born?\nPerry was born in 1909 in Stockport, where his father, Samuel Perry (1877–1954), was a cotton spinner. For the first decade of his life, he also lived in Bolton, Lancashire, and Wallasey, Cheshire, because his father was involved in local politics. When living in Wallasey, he attended Liscard Primary School and, briefly, Wallasey Grammar School. Perry moved to Brentham Garden Suburb in Ealing, west London, at the age of eleven years when his father became the national secretary of the Co-operative Party after World War I. His father became the Labour and Co-operative Party Member of Parliament (MP) for Kettering in 1929.\nProfessional Tennis Career\nAfter three years as the world’s No. 1 tennis amateur player, Perry turned professional late in 1936. This resulted in his being almost ostracised by the British tennis establishment. He played his first professional match on 6 January 1937 at Madison Square Garden against the best professional player, Ellsworth Vines, and won in four sets.\nIn the following year, 1938, the big tour was even longer this time, with Vines outscoring Perry 49-35, while the short tour in the Caribbean, Central, and South America was only at four to each of Perry and Vines. Perry finally won the US Pro at Chicago, winning it by defeating Bruce Barnes in the final.\nDon Budge won the Grand Slam in 1938 as an amateur and then turned professional and played a series of matches against both Vines and Perry in 1939, beating Vines 22 times to 17 and beating Perry by 28 victories to 8.\nIn October, Perry lost in the final of the U.S. Pro to Vines in four sets. Then Perry won a four-man round robin at Long Beach (he, Gorchakoff, and Stoefen finished level on 2 wins each). Perry won the Finnish relief event in New York in March over Vines and Budge. Perry won the West Coast Pro round robin in Los Angeles in April. This was the last time Perry and Vines played each other before Vines went full-time on a golf career. Perry won their last match. Perry lost the final of the U.S. Pro in Chicago to Budge.\nAfter breaking his elbow in a match against Bobby Riggs on the opening night of the Round Robin World Series, Perry had to miss several matches of the tour. Perry finished fourth in the standings. Soon after the pro circuit petered out in mid-1942, Perry was involved in World War II, where he served in the U.S. Air Force, having already gained American citizenship in 1939.\nIn 1946, Perry won events in January at Tucson (upsetting Bobby Riggs in the final), February at Omaha (upsetting Wayne Sabin in the final), April at Palm Springs over Carl Earn, and in May at El Paso over Frank Kovacs. Perry also played a series of matches against Tilden.\nPerry won the Slazenger Pro at Scarborough in July. In the final, he took four sets to defeat Yvon Petra, who had been the winner of the Wimbledon men’s singles two years earlier. “Perry observed one wag had lost none of his zest, sting, or shrewdness. Perry analyzed Petra’s game while losing the first set of the final and won the next three for the loss of seven games. ‘I knew a little bit more about the game than he did,’ said Perry afterward.”\nPerry turned 40 in May. By this time, Perry was playing on the pro circuit fitfully. Defending his title at Scarborough in July, Perry lost in the quarter-finals to Dinny Pails in five sets. Perry won the Slazenger Pro at Scarborough in August 1950, defeating Salem Khaled in the final. In August 1951, Perry, now 42, won his last title at Scarborough, defeating Francesco Romanoni. Perry won a tournament at Hagen in September 1953, defeating fellow veteran Hans Nusslein in the final. He played on until he was 50 in 1959, when he lost in the first round of the U.S. Pro at Cleveland.\nHow Did Fred Perry Die?\nOn 2 February 1995, Perry died at Epworth Hospital in Melbourne, Australia, after breaking his ribs following a fall in a hotel bathroom. He had been in Melbourne attending the Australian Open.\nWas Fred Perry married?\nPerry was one of the leading bachelors of the 1930s, and his off-court romances were reported in the world press. He was in love with German actress Marlene Dietrich and announced his engagement to British actress Mary Lawson in 1934, but soon gave up on the relationship when he shifted to the US. Later, in 1935, he married American film star Helen Vinson but divorced her in 1940.\nIn 1941, he married model Sandra Breaux for a short period of time. Then, in 1945, he married Lorraine Walsh, but that also ended in haste. Perry’s last marriage, to Barbara Riese, the sister of Patricia Roc, took place in 1952, and it was a long-lived one, more than forty years, until his death. Penny and David are their two children. David ran his father’s clothing line until it was taken over.\nHow Many Sisters Did Fred Perry Have?\nPerry had an elder sister, Edith, who was born in Stockport, Cheshire. Edith followed her brother’s sporting achievements very closely and always supported him. Perry also had a half-sister, Sylvia.",
  "https_samehhabeeb_uk_/https_samehhabeeb_uk_people_ealing-people_michael-balcon/content_121.html": "Sir Michael Balcon was a producer, but more than anything, he represented creativity, teamwork, and bravery. His leadership has changed the history of British cinema, leaving the world with memories that inspire filmmaking all around the world. With his efforts at Ealing Studios, grooming Alfred Hitchcock, and achieving excellence, Balcon has brought into the world an era of storytelling that cannot be compared with any other time.\nEarly Life and Background: Humble Beginnings\nSir Michael Elias Balcon was born on 19 May 1896 in Edgbaston, Birmingham. His parents were Lithuanian Jewish immigrants from Latvia, Louis Balcon and Laura (née Greenberg). Louis was quite financially unstable, and it would often be away from home; Laura cared for their five children.\nThough the financial condition of his family was terrible, Michael was very optimistic as a child. He was awarded a scholarship in 1907 for George Dixon Grammar School, Birmingham. Though he did not excel in his studies, the same school honors him by putting up a plaque for his contribution to the film world.\nEaling Studios: The Golden Years\nIn 1938, the current head of Ealing Studios extended an invitation to Balcon to head the studios. Under him, the studio emerged as the international excellence of British cinema. The Ealing Studio was possibly hailed for creating fewer films annually.\nHowever, if produced, it had the best quality of filmmaking. This period witnessed the emergence of the most recognized film directors, including the ones belonging to Dead of Night, The Blue Lamp, and the famous Ealing Comedies of Kind Hearts and Coronets.\nBalcon was an affable, team-playing head and often said that he was like a benevolent headmaster. In Michael Balcon Presents: A Lifetime of Films, he described the years at Ealing as “the most rewarding years in my career.”\nAwards and Contribution: A Lifetime of Excellence\nIt was indeed a very big contribution he made to the industry, which he was well known for. He was knighted in 1948 for services to British cinema. There was a great deal for him to offer in the creation of new directors and nurturing experimental projects to advance the British New Wave movement.\nAs chairman of the British Film Institute Production Board, he still had a great deal more work ahead of him, for he had a potential capability for molding the industry’s future. Some of his achievements include the establishment of Ealing Films in 1956, just after Rank Organization sold Ealing Studios to the BBC. His innovative drive towards perfection took Balcon into the hearts of the British film world considerably.\nPersonal Life: The Man Behind the Legacy\nHe married Aileen Freda Leatherman in 1924. Similarly, much respected herself, Aileen was promoted to MBE during the war. Theatre, opera, and traveling gifted them with many fulfilling cultural moments together. The children of Balcon are Jill and Jonathan.\nThe former is the former actress, while her younger brother, Jonathan, is a former minister. His daughter, Jill, was married to poet and writer Cecil Day-Lewis, which made him the father of Daniel Day-Lewis; who later became a super-successful actor all over the world, Oscar-winning.\nEven as the professional successes had characterized his life, personal issues did not shy away from finding him. Among the personal ills he had, he disapproved of his daughter Jill’s marriage to Day-Lewis, a disapproval that resulted in a complete estrangement from his daughter. His influence, however, formed his family as it became later on.\nMemorable Films: A Tribute to Excellence\nAmongst some of the most remarkable films ever created are the works of Balcon, such as:\n-\n- Kind Hearts and Coronets (1949)\n-\n- The Man in the White Suit (1951)\n-\n- The Ladykillers (1955)\n-\n- The Cruel Sea (1952)\nThis film collection has become the benchmark of British cinema for its cleverness, innovativeness, and ability to narrate.\nSir Michael Balcon’s Legacy Continues\nThe influence of Sir Michael Balcon extends far beyond the time he spent at Ealing Studios. He laid the basis for a peculiarly British identity in cinema—both realistic and humorous with poignant storytelling. He pioneered efforts in making British films known to international audiences, and it was realized that they were capable of equaling Hollywood output in terms of quality and originality.\nHe is honored with the BAFTA for Outstanding Contribution to British Film every year in his name. He remained committed to the blooming of young talent, moral filmmaking practices, and cultural resonance for film standards that future generations need to be inspired by.\nEven today, Balcon’s heritage remains in massive retrospectives about his films as well as Ealing Comedies’ continuous success and a great number of descendants, among them his grandson Daniel Day-Lewis. The great Sir Michael Balcon towered above other history-makers when it came to British cinema.\nFinal Years and Legacy\nBalcon remained an active advocate for British cinema in his later years. He was chairman of British Lion Films and continued mentoring young talent. His final production, Tom Jones (1963), received critical acclaim, further cementing his legacy.\nBalcon died on 17 October 1977 at his Sussex home, Upper Parrock. He was cremated, and his ashes were buried on the estate. His legacy in cinema lives on through the annual BAFTA Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Film, awarded in his name.",
  "https_samehhabeeb_uk_/https_samehhabeeb_uk_people_ealing-people_william-frederick-yeames-a-legacy-of-historical-narrative-art/content_49.html": "William Frederick Yeames RA (18 December 1835–3 May 1918) was an oil painter in oil on canvas English. He is the one portraying a Royalist’s son when questioned by Parliamentarians under the English Civil War in ‘And When Did You Last See Your Father?’\nBiography\nBorn in Taganrog, Russian Empire, Yeames was the son of a British consul who had been stationed in the region. In 1842, his father died suddenly, and Yeames was sent to school in Dresden. He started to study painting at this school, and early exposure to art encouraged him in his passion for the visual arts, which eventually set him on the path toward a distinguished career in painting.\nBy 1848, having squandered his family fortune, Yeames settled in London. There, he took classes in anatomy and composition with George Scharf and was a student of F. A. Westmacott in art. He rapidly improved, and from 1852 to 1853 he spent two years in Florence under the tutelage of such masters as Enrico Pollastrini and Raphael Buonajuti. While in Florence, he was absorbed into the history of art of Italy, making studies from frescoes by masters such as Andrea del Sarto, Ghirlandaio, and Gozzoli. He returned to Rome and continued his copying of Old Masters, this time, particularly of frescoes by Raphael in the Vatican.\nWhere Was Park Place Established?\nIn 1859, Yeames returned to London, where he established a studio in Park Place. Along with other prominent artists, he founded the St John’s Wood Clique. The clique consists of such members as Philip Hermogenes Calderon, Frederick Goodall, and George Adolphus Storey, among others. This clique is especially famous for a certain genre of historical and narrative paintings. Those paintings have histories intricately stitched into their subject matters.\nYeames’s style, which was in itself innovatory in a real sense, eventually became merged into one that later became known as the “problem picture,” the genre that had viewers wriggle with their unresolved dilemmas or paradoxes presented in the picture. In 1905, Yeames designed a mural for the Royal Exchange in London titled The Foundation of St Paul’s School, 1509. He has indeed mastered historical moments in monumental style.\nWho is William Frederick Yeames married to?\nHe got married to Anne Winfield on 18 August 1865 to Major James Stainbank Winfield of the East India Company, who is the brother to the photographer David Wilkie Wynfield. In between holidays spent in Hever Castle, they maintained their comfortable home life in London.\nCritical Acclaim\nDuring his career, Yeames could not gain proper critical acclaim. Despite this, he exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1859 and, in 1866, was made an Associate of the Royal Academy (ARA). His works, however, the public loved much, but in his style being unconventional and story-telling narration, his paintings were not represented in the choicest galleries of the times.\nUnlike the other artist groups at that time, the St John’s Wood Clique was pretty regular. Yeames and his contemporaries did not embrace bohemianism but instead joined a group that made for an artists with relatively stable and mature careers. The members specialize more or less in Tudor and Stuart subjects, taken often rather from historical events and occasions than to exact historical correctness.\nWhere Did Yeames Die?\nYeames died in Teignmouth, Devon, on 3 May 1918. His influence continues through his art and the substantial impact he has left behind on the world of art, specifically his problem pictures and his narrative paintings. In 2000, at his former house, 8 Campbell Road, Hanwell, London, a blue plaque was mounted where Yeames had lived between 1894 and 1912.\nInspiration for Paintings\nThe inspiration for the painting was derived from Yeame’s contemplation of the hard moral dilemmas children faced during such turbulent times. The young boy, modeled by Yeames’s nephew James Lambe Yeames, sits at the center of the composition. His innocent, questioning gaze contrasts with the stern interrogators around him, among whom can be identified a Roundhead officer, recognizable in his military garb and orange sash, along with other Parliamentarians. Around him stand his relatives: a girl, something of a type after Yeames’s niece Mary Yeames, peering anxiously for her turn to come under the observation, their mother and elder sister sitting in the background, representing anxiety and distress.\nIt is again a fine blend of innocence with the roughest war truths. The blond locks of the lad and the suit of blue portend his gullibility, his purity, whereas, ironically, the Parliamentarians also have a humane shape; even the chief questioner appears to be the nicer eyepiece. Even the sergeant consoling to the small lass has shown him a more humane part of character amidst all that is happening.\nWhy is When Did You Last See Your Father Popular?\nAnd When Did You Last See Your Father? quickly became a celebrated painting, getting wide notice and becoming something of a staple of the debate over narrative art. The painting was bought in 1878, just one year after the Walker Art Gallery opened in 1877. Also between 1933 and 1989, Madame Tussauds in London exhibited a life-size waxwork tableau based on the painting, casting in wax for generations the sad scene that Yeames painted.\nWhere is and When Did You Last See Your Father Displayed?\nThe painting is located in the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool. Madame Tussauds London also displayed a life-sized waxwork scene from the painting between 1933 and 1989.\nWho was the St John’s Wood Clique?\nThe members of the St. John’s Wood Clique include William Frederick Yeames, Philip Hermogenes Calderon, Frederick Goodall, and George Adolphus Storey. The clique was known to focus more on historical and narrative art and unfinished dilemmas that are often reflected in his works.\nWould Yeames have also struggled for prominence?\nYes, though successful in a popular way, Yeames did not have critical success in his work. His style and concern over narration were a bit less ideal for galleries such as the Royal Academy of Arts.\nIs there any commemoration for William Frederik?\nA blue plaque was erected in 2000 at his former house, 8 Campbell Road, Hanwell, London, to commemorate his work for art and history.",
  "https_samehhabeeb_uk_/https_samehhabeeb_uk_people_ealing-people_ronald-skirth-first-world-war-pacifist-from-ealing/content_64.html": "Ronald Skirth was a British soldier and a participant in the First World War. His experiences in the Battle of Messines and the Battle of Passchendaele in 1917 led him to resolve never to take human life, and for the rest of his army service, he deliberately made errors in the calculation of target points in the hope that it would ensure that the guns of his battery would miss their aiming point on the first attempt, thereby allowing the enemy to evacuate.\nEarly Life and War Service\nSkirth was born in Chelmsford and brought up in Bexhill-on-Sea. He had enlisted under the Derby Scheme to serve in the British Army. He had applied for his mobilization to be brought forward, and so he was called up two months before his 19th birthday in October 1916. He became a Battery Commander’s Assistant in the Royal Garrison Artillery, calculating the settings needed to fire the massive guns of a field battery. When he argued with a superior officer over whether to use a French church for target practice, he was demoted in rank from corporal to bombardier.\nDid Ronald Skirth Participate in a War?\nSkirth saw action in the Battle of the Messines, in which two of his closest friends, Bill and Geordie, were killed. On the same day, he had an “epiphany” when he stumbled on the corpse of a dead German of about his age and realized that one of the shells he had targeted might well have killed him. This was to mark the turning point in his thinking about the war as he determined that he was morally responsible for his actions and their consequences, irrespective of the chain of command.\nHe carried out this sabotage while still in Italy, where he remained until February 1919, save for a fortnight’s leave back in England in November and December 1918. He was rewarded with the British War Medal and Victory Medal for his services in the war but declined the Military Medal, which he thought was offered as part of an attempt to hush up a fatal accident that he had tried to avert.\nDid Ronald Skirth serve in the Army?\nIn September 1919, Skirth returned to England to start teacher training, for which he had enrolled before leaving to serve in the army. He trained in London and, after qualifying, taught briefly at a school in Bexhill-on-Sea before transferring in 1922 to a post at a school in Uxbridge.\nIn 1923 he and Ella Christian became engaged, and the following year, after Skirth secured a job at the Little Ealing Senior Boys’ School and found a flat they could share in Ealing, they married on 29 December 1924, at the Church of St Barnabus in Bexhill. In September 1929, their only child was born, a daughter whom they named Jean. (They had expected a boy who would have been called John.)\nFollowing the war, he returned to Ealing with the family to Skirth and his wife Ella’s various homes throughout their life together, where he remained working as a teacher until his retirement in 1958. He died in England in 1977.\nCharacter and Beliefs\nA self-proclaimed ‘dreamer’ with romantic sensibilities Skirth was to be very loving of literature, especially poetry; a much-annotated copy of the Golden Treasury that he took along with him from the Western Front, Francis Turner Palgrave His favorite poets of course were: John Keats, Percy Bysshe Shelley and Lord Byron. He had immense love for all beauty which pervaded his musical and architectural or natural splendor. On the Western Front, he wrote, he was “deprived of the one thing that to me was as precious as life itself, my love of beauty”.\nIt has been said that though Skirth had volunteered to the Army in 1915 as an idealistic patriot, convinced that “King and Country” were causes worth fighting for, it did not take too long before he became disillusioned with the war and the army. He attributed this to a combination of his sensitive character, his Christian upbringing and sense of right and wrong, and, most significantly, the horror of his war experiences.\nAfter the war, Skirth remained a steadfast pacifist until his death. He believed that Britain should not have declared war against Germany in 1939, and he also added that it was better for him to accept occupation than resist an invading enemy with weapons.\nPublication\nIn 2010, it was published in book form by Macmillan as The Reluctant Tommy: Ronald Skirth’s Extraordinary Memoir of the First World War, edited by Duncan Barrett. In an introduction, Barrett wrote that he felt Skirth’s story “deserved as wide an audience as possible—and to be read in its protagonist’s own words.”.\nSkirth’s daughter Jean, who had permitted for the memoir to be published, remained uncertain whether publishing the memoir was what her father would have wanted but believed that it was important that his story should be widely known.\nThe book carried a foreword by Channel 4 News anchor Jon Snow, in which he wrote about his grandfather, Lieutenant-General Sir Thomas D’Oyly Snow. As one of the most popular descriptions of the lower ranks, “lions led by donkeys,” Snow accepted that “If Ronald Skirth was a ‘lion’, Thom Snow was ultimately a ‘donkey’.”.\nWhat Did Ronald Skirth Do After Retiring from Teaching?\nIn January 1971, after retiring from teaching, Skirth began writing a handwritten memoir detailing his conduct and experiences during the First World War, specifically his experience of disillusionment. Although he had originally conceived of a book that would focus on his marriage to his wife Ella, mentioning the war only in passing, he soon felt a “compulsion” to write more about his war experiences. He spent more than a year working on the memoir, filling five green ring binders with many hundreds of pages, and over the next few years, despite suffering two strokes, he kept returning to the material, editing, amending, and adding to what he had written.",

Known for his ability to tackle intense and challenging subject matters, McQueen’s body of work spans across various mediums, earning him numerous prestigious awards, including an Academy Award, two BAFTA Awards, and a Golden Globe Award. For instance, Sir McQueen won the BFI Fellowship in 2016, and his honor of being made a Knight of the Royal Order by Queen Elizabeth II happened in 2020. Moreover, he made the list for the annual Time 100 as given by Time magazine of “most influential people in the world” in 2014.\nWhere is Steve McQueen from?\nBorn to a Grenadian father and a Trinidadian mother, McQueen grew up in Ealing, West London. His early years were a mix of fighting his way through a difficult school environment, coupled with having dyslexia and physical handicaps such as wearing an eyepatch over one eye to correct a lazy eye. Nevertheless, his artistic talent was well apparent from early on. Art, his passion, drew him to diverse artistic disciplines, beginning with A-level art at Ealing, Hammersmith, and West London College. He attended Chelsea College of Art and Design; however, he ultimately pursued a degree in fine art at Goldsmiths College, University of London.\nEarly Career and Short Films\nMcQueen was a fine artist before making feature films, creating provocative pieces projected onto gallery walls. His short films, including Bear (1993) and Deadpan (1997), demonstrated an easy juxtaposition of visual emotion with complex emotion.\nThe silent, black-and-white films frequently used stark, minimalistic imagery as a way to envelop the viewer in the scene. This experimentation with sound and image flowed into his films such as Drumroll (1998), where McQueen used multiple cameras to exemplify the narrative possibilities through a single object—a drum.\nThroughout the 1990s and early 2000s, McQueen’s visual art explored themes of identity, race, and socio-political commentary, gaining recognition for his innovative approach. His installations, like White Elephant (1998), demonstrated his ability to manipulate space to provoke thought and discussion.\nBreakthrough with Feature-Length Films\nMcQueen started from art to feature film making in Hunger (2008), which did critically well for him and eventually won him Caméra d’Or at the Cannes Film Festival. The movie, a period drama about the 1981 Irish hunger strike, set in motion a trend of uncompromising storytelling during his career. The success in Hunger catapulted McQueen to the forefront. He became that filmmaker who feared not to try anything, sometimes even the wrong things, since he was too good at difficult and often the most controversial pieces of work.\nFollowing Hunger, McQueen continued his work on complex narratives with Shame (2011), a film that ventured into the raw and uncomfortable world of sex addiction, with Michael Fassbender delivering a powerful, transformative performance. Shame was met with critical acclaim across the board, many of whom spoke of McQueen’s mastery of visual storytelling and Fassbender’s harrowing performance.\nIn 2013, McQueen’s 12 Years a Slave brought him world recognition and, with it, the Academy Award for Best Picture, which did not go home to a black person until then. This powerful historical drama, set to the account of Solomon Northup’s memoir, spoke directly to the country’s harrowing experiences of slavery, further proving McQueen a filmmaker who continues to challenge viewers to confront past injustices.\nExpanding the Medium: Television and Anthology Series\nMcQueen’s skills were also extended to television, including Small Axe (2020), a series of five anthology films that explore the West Indian community in London from the late 1960s to the early ’80s. The series was deeply personal and reflective of McQueen’s heritage, garnering critical acclaim for its raw, authentic portrayals of marginalized communities. Each film in the series—Mangrove, Lovers Rock, and Education—garnered accolades, with Lovers Rock topping Sight and Sound’s best films of 2020.\nOther notable works by McQueen include the BBC documentary series Uprising (2021) and the World War II drama Blitz (2024). His versatility and ability to navigate through various genres are what define his commitment to pushing artistic boundaries.\nRecent Projects and Legacy\nRecent works of McQueen include the documentary Occupied City (2023), where he deals with Amsterdam in wartime during the Nazi occupation, and Blitz—the WWII documentary dedicated to the human experience of air raids of London (2024).\nThrough his career, McQueen has proven himself to be a trailblazer in the film industry, fusing artistic sensibilities with powerful storytelling to create films that provoke, inspire, and resonate on a deeply personal level. His influence goes beyond filmmaking into discussions of race, history, and social justice, and his legacy continues to grow with each new project.\nIs Steve McQueen married?\nMcQueen is married to Bianca Stigter, a Dutch cultural critic, with whom he has a daughter and a son, Alex and Dexter. Since 1997, the McQueens have maintained a home in Amsterdam, in addition to their home in London. He was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2002 Birthday Honours, Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2011 New Year Honours for services to the visual arts, and was knighted in the 2020 New Year Honours for services to film. McQueen has been twice listed in the Powerlist Top 10 of the most influential Black Britons.\nAwards and Honors\nFor 12 Years a Slave, he took home the Best Picture Academy Award, [40] the BAFTA Award for Best Film, and the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Drama. [90] McQueen is the first black filmmaker in history to ever win the Academy Award for Best Picture.[91] He became the first recipient of both the Academy Award and the Turner Prize.[92] McQueen won the Award for Cinematic Production with the Royal Photographic Society along with the Cologne Film Prize as regards his lifetime of work. McQueen was knighted in the 2020 New Year Honours List by Queen Elizabeth II; however, he did not receive this knighthood until March of 2022 at Windsor Castle.

His works were so beautiful, capturing the crux of historical and ecclesiastical structures and urban and pastoral scenes, that he was considered one of the prominent figures of his time.\nWho was Henry Charles Brewer?\nThe life and work of Henry Charles Brewer are truly the definition of creativity and dedication. This is from his first background within a family of famous artists to his travels and glorious exhibitions; Brewer had left deep impressions upon the world of art. His watercolors were evocative interplays of light and atmosphere that inspired awe and reflected his profound connection to the landscapes and architecture he loved. Being part of a family deeply rooted in both art and culture, Brewer’s contributions enrich the legacy of British art and ensure his place among its celebrated figures.\nWhen and Where was Henry Charles Brewer Born?\nBorn on May 25, 1866, in Würzburg, Bavaria, Brewer was born out of a distinguished lineage of professional artists. His father, Henry William Brewer, was already an accomplished architectural illustrator; his brother, James Alphege Brewer, had established success as an etcher and was of sufficient talent; even his elder brother, John Francis Brewer, was a novelist and an organist.\nWho Were the Notable Family Members of Henry Charles Brewer?\nThe intellectual and artistic roots were deep with the Brewers. Henry Charles Brewer’s paternal grandfather, John Sherren Brewer, was a historian, and his great-uncle, E. Cobham Brewer, authored the iconic Brewer’s Dictionary of Phrase & Fable. Such a family background ensured an environment very laced with creativity and scholarship.\nBrewer pursued his education at St. Charles College, Kensington. This was an important juncture that contributed to his formation as an artist. Later in life, Brewer married Mary Malle from Dover, Kent.\nTheir strong convictions of beliefs were also reflected through the family lineages. For example, Augustus Pugin and the Oxford Movement brought Brewer himself and many of his descendants under influence and compelled the entire family line to turn devout Roman Catholics. That very same spirit had strongly continued within the families through their children, namely, Henry Charles Brewer.\nWhere did Henry Charles Brewer Receive his Education and Training in Art?\nIn adulthood, Brewer lived at Perryn Road, Acton, which turned out to be the hub of his artistic career. His brother James also was living nearby; the two men often collaborated with each other over artistic projects and were active within local creative groups, such as the Ealing Art Group, with its thriving sense of artistic activity.\nHenry Charles Brewer was initially trained formally in the Westminster School of Art by Frederick Brown. After his course, Brewer spent much time traveling to places around the world and gathering inspiration from them. Among the places that he visited during his travels, Brewer was able to visit such diverse locations as Tangier, Spain, Greece, Belgium, France, and Italy; Venice was also one of his favorite places to visit.\nThe watercolours of Brewer were characterized by an atmospheric quality and loose technique. He was able to portray the fleeting beauty of a dawn and dusk sky with a surprising ability to reflect tranquility and wonder in those works. Brewer’s subjects would range from cathedrals and old historical buildings to a cityscape to a pastoral. London was probably featured most regularly throughout his portfolio.\nIn which Exhibitions and Art Societies did Brewer Participate?\nFrom 1899 through 1902, Brewer displayed his works in establishments that included the famed Fine Art Society and the Royal Academy. His fantastic artistry was celebrated in 1913 when he received a gold medal from the Royal Society of Arts. He became an international icon when he participated in exhibitions held in Australia and New Zealand.\nBrewer was a fellow of the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours. He was elected to the Royal Institution of Great Britain in 1914 and became a fellow of the Society of Graphic Art. In 1932, he had an important exhibition at the Fine Art Society, called Watercolours of Venice & Northern Italy, which showed his love for Italian landscapes.\nThough the Royal Collection Trust does not hold any of Brewer’s works, his contribution to the royal art is not something to forget. In 1937, he rendered a set of paintings of the Coronation Ceremony of King George VI. Five of the various works he produced were published as large colored plates in The Illustrated London News Coronation Record Number George VI & Queen Elizabeth, making his work last.\nArtistic Themes and Legacy\nIt is apparent that Roman Catholicism, the religion of Brewer himself, interacted with more aspects of his life than his artwork. Unlike his father, whose paintings sometimes ended up in devotional imagery, Henry Charles Brewer’s themes stayed broad commercial themes. An example would be that his contribution to the 1891 book St. Ignatius Loyola and the Early Jesuits by Stuart Rose had a lot of buildings and landscapes rather than obvious religious themes.\nAmong Brewer’s very few religious art ventures, he was painting wall paintings in the Lady Chapel of St. Peter’s Church in Ealing in 1928. The murals of the Annunciation are among his only known church decorations. Interestingly, the face of the Angel Gabriel is believed to have been modeled after his brother James Alphege Brewer.\nThroughout his whole life, Brewer held a strong love for art. No painting displayed any overtly religious view, yet nearly every one of his paintings showed a deep sense of beauty and reverence—from bustling cityscapes to peaceful country vistas.\nWhen and where did Henry Charles Brewer Pass Away?\nHenry Charles Brewer’s life was very satisfactory. It is all due to his art and family. Henry Charles Brewer died on 21 October 1950, at home in Ealing. On the north side of Acton Cemetery, he is buried, near where brother James is also buried. His contribution to art lives on and is proof of his creativity and imagination.\nPublic Collections\nToday, the legacy of Brewer lives on in public collections like the Victoria & Albert Museum, which holds two of his works. This stands testament to his capturing the spirit of his subjects; thus, it places him in the history of British art.",

The three individuals, John Chapman, James Kirby, and James (Jim) Henderson, were working as relief workers for the World Central Kitchen (WCK) when they fell victim to an Israeli airstrike.\nIt is evident that James Murray’s silence may be motivated by a desire not to upset his friends in Israel and within the Labour Party, a stance that prioritizes political alliances over the fundamental duty of protecting British citizens abroad.\nJohn Chapman, 57, James Kirby, 47, and James (Jim) Henderson, 33, were all former soldiers who had dedicated their lives to serving their country. They were part of the security team employed by UK-based security firm Solace Global, providing crucial assistance to WCK’s humanitarian efforts in Gaza.\nMr. Chapman, described by his family as “an incredible father, husband, son, and brother,” was among the three British nationals tragically killed. Mr. Kirby, born in Bristol and a veteran of tours in Bosnia and Afghanistan, was hailed by his family as a hero whose absence leaves an irreplaceable void. James Henderson, the youngest of the three victims, had only been in Gaza for just over a week and was set to return home imminently before his life was abruptly cut short.\nIn light of this appalling tragedy, Sameh Habeeb questions James Murray’s inexplicable silence and failure to condemn the killings. As an elected representative of Ealing North, it is incumbent upon Mr. Murray to speak out against such atrocities, particularly when British nationals are involved. The absence of any statement or action from Mr. Murray raises serious concerns about his commitment to representing and advocating for the interests and safety of his constituents, both at home and abroad.\n“It is deeply disappointing and utterly unacceptable that James Murray has chosen to remain silent in the face of such a horrific loss of British lives,” said Sameh Habeeb. “As an MP, it is his duty to stand up for the rights and security of all British citizens, regardless of where they may be. His silence only serves to amplify the voices of those who seek to ignore or downplay the gravity of this tragedy.”\nSameh Habeeb calls on James Murray to immediately break his silence and publicly condemn the killing of John Chapman, James Kirby, and James Henderson. Furthermore, he urges Mr. Murray to take concrete steps to ensure that justice is served for the victims and their families, and to actively engage with relevant authorities to prevent such senseless loss of life in the future.\nFurthermore, a landslide majority of Ealing North residents oppose the ongoing Israeli genocide in Gaza, yet James Murray has failed to represent their voices in parliament. His lack of advocacy for social justice issues has led to a loss of trust among the public, including members of his own party.\nHabeeb concluded that “it is evident that James Murray is disconnected from reality on numerous local and national issues, choosing to focus solely on his role within the Labour shadow cabinet to the detriment of his constituents.”",
  "https_samehhabeeb_uk_/https_samehhabeeb_uk_people_ealing-people_alan-blumlein-the-ingenious-inventor-from-ealing-who-revolutionized-sound-and-vision/content_124.html": "Alan Blumlein (29 June 1903–7 June 1942) was an English electronics engineer, noted for his numerous inventions in the fields of telecommunications, sound recording, stereophonic sound, television, and radar. He earned 128 patents and was one of the most influential engineers and inventors of his generation.\nEarly life\nAlan Dower Blumlein was born on 29 June 1903 in Hampstead, London. His father, Semmy Blumlein, was a German-born naturalized British subject. Semmy was the son of Joseph Blumlein, a German of Jewish descent, and Philippine Hellmann, a French woman of German descent. Alan’s mother, Jessie Dower, was Scottish, daughter of William Dower (born 1837), who went to South Africa for the London Missionary Society. Alan was christened as a Presbyterian; he later married in a Church of England parish church\nWhat did Alan Blumlein invent?\nIn December of 1931, Blumlein patented an amazing new method of recording, which he termed “binaural sound.” The binaural sound was almost what we’d call “stereo” today. It used two microphones, recorded two separate recordings, and played back from two separate loudspeakers. Here are his achievements:\n1. Telecommunications\nIn 1924, he started work in his first appointment at International Western Electric, a subsidiary of Western Electric Company, then International Standard Electric Corporation, and ultimately Standard Telephones and Cables (STC). It is there he made the measurement amplitude/frequency response of the human ears; then, he, based on this measurement, designed the first weighting networks.\nIn 1924 he published (with Professor Edward Mallett) the first of his only two IEE papers, on high-frequency resistance measurement. This won him the IEE’s Premium award for innovation. The following year he wrote (with Norman Kipping) a series of seven articles for Wireless World.\n2. Sound recording\nIn 1929 Blumlein resigned from STC and joined the Columbia Graphophone Company, where he reported directly to general manager Isaac Shoenberg. His first project was to find a method of disc cutting that circumvented a Bell patent in the Western Electric moving-iron cutting head then used, and on which substantial royalties had to be paid. He invented the moving-coil disc-cutting head, which not only got around the patent but offered greatly improved sound quality. He led a small team that developed the concept into a practical cutter. Two other important team members were Herbert Holman and Henry “Ham” Clark. Their work resulted in patents.\n3. Ultra-linear amplifier\nIn June 1937, Blumlein patented what has become known as the Ultra-Linear amplifier, US Patent 2,218,902, June 5th, 1937. What could have been quite a simple circuit was a breakthrough in design since it provided for a tap of the primary output transformer feeding the second grid; this improved linearity in an amplifier. Just like the tap set at the anode end of the primary winding, it was connected to the circuit as if it were just a triode; otherwise, it was located at the supply end, more or less as a pentode. Blumlein discovered that if the tap was placed at a distance of 15–20% from the supply end of the output transformer, the tube or valve would assemble the best desirable properties of the two designs, that is, a triode and a pentode.\n4. Long-tailed pair\nBlumlein may or may not have invented the long-tailed pair, but his name is on the first patent (1936). The long-tailed pair is a form of differential amplifier that has been popular since the days of the vacuum tube (valve). It is now more pervasive than ever, as it is particularly suitable for implementation in integrated circuit form, and almost every operational amplifier integrated circuit contains at least one.\n5. Stereophonic sound\nIn 1931, Blumlein invented what he termed “binaural sound,” which is now more commonly known as stereophonic sound. In early 1931, he and his wife were at the cinema. The sound reproduction systems of the early talkies only had a single set of speakers—the actor might be on one side of the screen, but the voice could come from the other. Blumlein declared to his wife that he had discovered a means whereby the sound could follow the actor.\nContributions as an EMI Team Member\nTelevision was developed by many individuals and companies throughout the 1920s and 1930s. Blumlein’s work, as a member of the EMI team, began in earnest in 1933 when his boss, Isaac Shoenberg, assigned him full-time to TV research. His concepts included:\n-\n- Resonant flyback scanning (the use of a tuned circuit in the creation of a sawtooth deflection waveform). (British Patent No. 400976, an application filed April 1932.)\n-\n- Application of constant-impedance network to power supplies to make the voltage regulation immune to changes in load frequency down to DC (421546, 16 June 1933).\n-\n- Black-level clamping (422914, 11 July 1933 by Blumlein, Browne and Hardwick). This is an advanced version of the DC restoration device\n-\n- The slot antenna. (515684, applied for 7 March 1939.)\nPrivate life\nAlan Blumlein was married and had two sons, Simon Blumlein and David Blumlein. Apart from his professional career, he was very fond of music. He tried playing the piano, but not for long. He enjoyed horse riding and at times accompanied his father-in-law on cub hunting.\nWhat is the Blumlein stereo microphone technique?\nThe Blumlein Pair method uses two microphones with a bidirectional figure-of-eight pickup pattern, and they position them on top of each other—90 degrees off-axis from each other. Bringing microphone elements as close together as possible will help with phase coherence.\nHow Did Alan Blumlein Die?\nBlumlein was killed in the crash of an H2S-equipped Handley Page Halifax test aircraft while making a test flight for the Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE) on 7 June 1942. During the flight from RAF Defford, whilst at an altitude of 500 ft (150 meters) the Halifax developed an engine fire which rapidly grew out of control. The aircraft was seen to lose altitude, then rolled inverted and struck the ground. The crash occurred near the village of Welsh Bicknor in Herefordshire. Two of Blumlein’s colleagues, Cecil Oswald Browne and Frank Blythen, also died in the crash.",

Known for his signature dirty laugh, he is most famous for numerous appearances in the Carry-On film series.\nJames was born to a middle-class Jewish family in South Africa. His career began in his home country, but he reached the pinnacle of his success in the UK. He began his screen career playing small parts in films in 1947 and went on to feature in many minor and supporting roles until the 1950s. He appeared in the film The Lavender Hill Mob in 1951, starring Alec Guinness.\nWhere was Sid James born?\nBorn as Solomon Joel Cohen on 8 May 1913 to Jewish parents in South Africa (at that time a British dominion), the name was later changed to Sidney Joel Cohen and then to Sidney James. His family lived on Hancock Street in Hillbrow, Johannesburg.\nWas Sid James a boxer?\nHe claimed various previous occupations, including diamond cutter, dance tutor, and boxer, but in reality had trained and worked as a hairdresser.\nCareer: 1947 to 1968\nHis first film credits came with Night Beat and Black Memory, two crime dramas of 1947. In Powell and Pressburger’s The Small Back Room, he was the barman of the alcoholic hero in 1949. He appeared in his first comedy in 1951, number 17 on the British Film Institute’s list of the 100 best British films: with Alfie Bass, he made up the bullion robbery gang headed by Alec Guinness and Stanley Holloway.\nHe also was featured in such films as Lady Godiva Rides Again and The Galloping Major, both in 1951, and as Harry Hawkins in The Titfield Thunderbolt of 1953, and headlined in the film version of The Wedding of Lilli Marlene.\nJames had a supporting role as a producer of TV adverts in Charlie Chaplin’s non-comic support role as a journalist in the science-fiction film Quatermass 2, and he appeared in Hell Drivers, all 1957, with Stanley Baker. The next year he co-starred with Miriam Karlin in the half-hour East End, West End, a comedy series for six weeks from Associated-Rediffusion for ITV, though by that time in February and March 1958, more than enough of these episodes were made.\nHe had commenced working with Tony Hancock in 1954 for his BBC Radio series Hancock’s Half Hour. Having seen him in The Lavender Hill Mob, it was the conceit of the writers of Hancock’s to have James make an appearance in Hancock.\nIn 1964, he appeared twice on The Eamonn Andrews Show. A few seconds of the first scenes of one of these survive and can be heard and seen in the television program Undermind, Episode 6, “Intent to Destroy,” transmitted on 12 June 1965. His name is announced; the program is seen on a television camera seconds later.\nIn 1968, James, Val Doonican, and Arthur Askey were filmed playing golf in the village of Cockington near Torquay (British Pathé archives, film reference 457.1) for their production Viva Torbay: Travelling to the British Seaside.\nHow Many Times Did Sid James Marry?\nHe was married three times. In 1936, he married Berthe Sadie Delmont, and they had a daughter, Elizabeth, in 1937; they divorced in 1940, primarily because he had many girlfriends. In 1943 he married a ballerina, Meg Sergei (1913–1977); in 1947 they had a daughter, Reina.\nThey divorced on 17 August 1952. On 21 August 1952, he married Valerie Elizabeth Patsy Assan (1928–2022), an actress who used the stage name Ashton. They had a son, Steve James, born in 1954, who became a music producer, and a daughter, Sue, who became a television producer.\nDuring his marriage to Valerie, he had a well-publicized affair with Carry On co-star Barbara Windsor that lasted three years. The affair was dramatized in the 1998 stage play Cleo, Camping, Emmanuelle and Dick and its 2000 television adaptation Cor, Blimey!.\nWhy Did Sid James Fall Out with Ronnie Knight?\nJames’s fixation on Windsor was such that it was even said that her then-husband Ronnie Knight had all of James’s furniture rearranged at home as a veiled threat and, on another occasion, put an axe in James’s floor, but close friends of the time, including Vince Powell and William G. Stewart, dismissed the suggestions.\nInterest in Gambling\nJames was a compulsive gambler though largely hapless, and lost dozens of thousands of pounds over his lifetime. His gambling addiction was to such an extent that even an arrangement was struck that his wife did not know how much he was bringing back home because one part of it was being siphoned to pay over at the hands of his addiction of gambling.\nWhat was the Cause of Sid James’ Death?\nFour days after the sixth series of Bless This House ended on 26 April 1976, James was acting in a revival of a comedy, The Mating Season, when he suffered a heart attack on stage at the Sunderland Empire Theatre. Actresses Olga Lowe and Audrey Jeans thought he was playing a practical joke when he didn’t reply to their dialogue.\nWhen they ad-libbed to him and he still failed to respond, they moved towards the wings to seek help. The technical manager, Melvyn James (no relation), called for the curtain to close and requested a doctor, while the audience—who were unaware of what was happening—laughed, believing the events to be part of the show. An ambulance was called, and he was pronounced dead on arrival at Sunderland General Hospital.\nFuneral and Cremation\nWhen he died, plans to shoot for the seventh and eighth series of Bless This House had already been agreed on, not to mention a new film version, as well as an hourlong television variety special featuring James. All those plans went down the drain with his death. Bruce Forsyth eventually became the lead player of the 1976 television adaptation of The Mating Season, which was broadcast on ITV in December of that same year. James was cremated, and his ashes had been scattered at Golders Green Crematorium.",
  "https_samehhabeeb_uk_/https_samehhabeeb_uk_people_ealing-people_elsie-jeanette-oxenham-the-influence-of-ealing-on-her-legacy/content_68.html": "Elsie Jeanette Oxenham (25 November 1880–9 January 1960) was an English girls’ story writer who took the name Oxenham as her pseudonym when her first book, Goblin Island, was published in 1907. Her Abbey Series of 38 titles are her best-known and best-loved books. In her lifetime she had 87 titles published, and another two have since been published by her niece, who discovered the manuscripts in the early 1990s.\nShe is regarded as being one of the major authors of girls’ stories in the first half of the twentieth century, being one of the ‘Big Three’ with Elinor Brent-Dyer and Dorita Fairlie Bruce. Angela Brazil is better known—probably more widely known—but did not write her books in a series about the same group of characters or set in the same place or school, as did the Big Three.\nBiography\nElsie Jeanette Dunkerley was born in Southport, Lancashire, England, in November 1880, to an English father and a Scottish mother. The family moved before she was 2, to Ealing, West London, and here they spent almost forty years of their lives. Dunkerley and her two sisters went privately to schools; she also regularly attended the congregation of the church in Ealing. Of these six children—Elsie, Marjory, or Maida; Roderic; Theodora, or Theo; Erica; and Hugo Dunkerley—were Elsie, Marjory, or Maida; Roderic; Theodora, or Theo; Erica; and Hugo Dunkerley. They moved to Worthing, Sussex, in 1922 and spent time in five different houses while living in Ealing.\nWhy did Elsie Jeanette Dunkerley choose the pseudonym “Oxenham”?\nWhen Goblin Island was published in 1907, she took the surname Oxenham as her pen name; her father, William Arthur Dunkerley, had used the pen name “John Oxenham” for many years prior to this. During the London years, Elsie Oxenham was associated with the British Camp Fire Girls movement and became a qualified guardian-leader of a group of Camp Fire Girls. She led this Camp Fire Group for nearly 6 years, up until the move to Sussex.\nWhat is the Abbey Series About?\nThe Abbey of the series is almost a character in itself. Based on Cleeve Abbey in Somerset, it appears first as a romantic ruin in the second of the series, The Abbey Girls. The book ends with cousins Joan and Joy Shirley residing at Abinger Hall, of the gardens where the Abbey stands. Joy has been discovered to be the granddaughter of the late owner, Sir Antony Abinger and the Hall is left to her, but Joan, who was not related to Sir Antony, has been left the Abbey “Because of [her] love for it, and because [her] knowledge of it was so thorough.\n“The Abbey and its influence pervades the whole series. Characters try to live up to the precepts of the early Cistercian monks who lived there, and even when facing difficult situations abroad, find that the Abbey ethos helps them find the way through to the right decision. Oxenham depicted herself directly and indirectly in several places within the Abbey series. As “The Writing Person” she is depicting herself as she was in the early 1920s, over 40 years of age, and going to the folk dance classes run by the English Folk Dance Society in London.\nWhat are the Themes and influences in the writing of Elsie J. Oxenham?\nOxenham’s religious background was in Congregationalism. This gave a Protestant ethos to her writing and she expressed opinions. Many of her characters suffer through a tough time in life, and faith assists them in passing through the ordeal. Several of the books written in the 1920s and 1930s, particularly, include discussions between characters as to the meaning of life and the reasons behind events. These in-depth conversations tend to appear less frequently in the later books, but even as late as 1948, in A Fiddler for the Abbey Mary-Dorothy Devine, who has become “advisor-in-chief to the clan’’ talks to Rosalind Kane about the biblical concept of “rain falling on the just and the unjust” and the reasons behind the occurrence of both good and bad events.\nFolk dancing\nFolk dancing is a strong influence in many of the books. From Girls of the Hamlet Club (1914) and at School with the Roundheads (1915) until The Girls of the Abbey School (1921), it was shown as a fairly easy thing for girls to do and to teach each other. By the time of The Abbey Girls Go Back to School (1922), it is obvious that Oxenham herself had made contact with the English Folk Dance Society and learned that the dances were not so straightforward after all. The books written from that point for the next six or so years until Abbey Girls Win Through (1928) characterize members of the EFDS hierarchy with warmth and almost reverence.\nCampfire\nCamp Fire features prominently in many of Oxenham’s books between 1917 and 1940. Oxenham was a Camp Fire Guardian when she lived in Ealing, but the attempt to form a group in Sussex failed. Camp Fire’s ideals of Work, Health, and Love—’Wohelo’—and the training for young girls in household tasks and cookery it provided were integral to Oxenham’s philosophy and underlie the plots of several books. From the Camp Fire as an integral part of a school in A School Camp Fire (1917) and The Crisis in Camp Keema (1928) to the lone Camp Fire Girl, Barbara Holt, in The Junior Captain (1923)\nWhy Does Elsie Have an Important Place in Children’s Literature?\nElsie J. Oxenham is, among collectors of British Girls’ Fiction, one of the ‘Big Three,’ the other two being Elinor Brent-Dyer and Dorita Fairlie Bruce. While Angela Brazil is the first name to spring to mind for non-specialists, she did not create a long series as the other three did, and in terms of collecting and interest, Brazil is less popular than they are.\nWhat is Elsie J. Oxenham best known for?\nOxenham was not the most prolific of these three, since she had 87 titles published during her lifetime (and another two were published by her niece, who discovered the manuscripts amongst Oxenham’s papers in the 1990s), whereas Brent-Dyer published 100 books of various kinds. Almost forty of Oxenham’s books make up the main Abbey Series, and another thirty or so are in several connected series, while the remaining twenty—some in small series of their own and some as isolated titles—are not.",

In 1941, his friend Harry Crossman sent Cameron a ticket to see a revival of Chu Chin Chow at the Palace Theatre.\nCameron was fed up with doing menial jobs in the kitchen of the Strand Corner House and asked Crossman if he could get him on the show. He informed Cameron that all the parts had been cast, but two or three weeks later, when one of the actors did not show up, Crossman arranged a meeting with the director Robert Atkins, who cast Cameron on the spot. He played a speaking role as Joseph, the chauffeur in the American play The Petrified Forest by Robert E. Sherwood.\nFilm Career\nCameron’s first starring role was in the 1951 film Pool of London, by Basil Dearden, a post-war, London-based film that incorporates racial prejudice, romance—the merchant sailor who falls in love with a young white woman, played by Susan Shaw—and a diamond robbery. He received much critical acclaim for his role in the movie, which is rated as “the first major role for a black actor in a British mainstream film.”.\nThe first of his major film roles was in Simba, which he starred in in 1955. The drama was set against the background of the Mau Mau uprising in Kenya. Cameron was cast as Peter Karanja, a doctor struggling to reconcile his admiration for Western civilization with his Kikuyu heritage. That same year Cameron played the Mau Mau general Jeroge in Safari.\nCameron’s later film appearances include a major role in Sidney Pollack’s The Interpreter (2005) as dictator Edmond Zuwanie, who is a fictionized version of Robert Mugabe (then leader of Zimbabwe). He appeared in a cameo as a portrait artist in the 2006 film The Queen (directed by Stephen Frears), alongside Helen Mirren.\n-\n- Pool of London (1951)\n-\n- Simba (1955)\n-\n- Safari (1955)\n-\n- The Heart Within (1957)\n-\n- Sapphire (1959)\n-\n- The Message (1976)\n-\n- Tarzan the Magnificent (1960)\n-\n- Flame in the Streets (1961)\n-\n- Tarzan’s Three Challenges (1963)\n-\n- Guns at Batasi (1964)\n-\n- Battle Beneath the Earth (1967)\n-\n- A Warm December (1973)\n-\n- Dr. No (1962) (considered for a role, not cast)\n-\n- Thunderball (1965)\n-\n- Cuba (1979)\n-\n- The Interpreter (2005)\n-\n- The Queen (2006)\n-\n- Inception (2010)\n-\n- Up on the Roof (2013)\nTelevision Career\nCameron acted in a plethora of television series, but among his earliest starring roles was as a West Indian cab driver in the UK in the BBC 1960 TV drama, The Dark Man. The play explored the responses and prejudices he encountered in his job. In 1956 he had a minor role in another BBC drama looking at workplace racism, A Man From The Sun, where he played community leader Joseph Brent, other actors including Errol John, Cy Grant, Colin Douglas, and Nadia Cattouse.\nCameron also guest-starred in several successful series, such as Danger Man, or, as the US called it, Secret Agent, and co-starred with that series’ leading actor, Patrick McGoohan. In addition, he reunited with Patrick McGoohan for his stint as the Haitian supervisor of a “nose” (face) transplantation experiment in an episode of The Prisoner in 1967.\n-\n- The Dark Man (BBC, 1960)\n-\n- A Man From The Sun (BBC, 1956)\n-\n- Danger Man (also known as Secret Agent in the US)\n-\n- The Prisoner – Episode: The Schizoid Man (1967)\n-\n- Emergency – Ward 10\n-\n- The Zoo Gang\n-\n- Crown Court—Two stories in 1973\n-\n- Jackanory—Read five Brer Rabbit stories (1971)\n-\n- Dixon of Dock Green\n-\n- Doctor Who – Serial: The Tenth Planet\n-\n- Waking the Dead\n-\n- Kavanagh QC\n-\n- Babyfather\n-\n- EastEnders – Role: Mr. Lambert\n-\n- Dalziel and Pascoe\n-\n- Lovejoy\n-\n- Neverwhere (BBC2, 1996)\nWhat Religion Did Earl Cameron Follow?\nFrom 1963, Cameron was a practitioner of the Baháʼí Faith, joining the religion at the time of the first Baháʼí World Congress, held at London’s Royal Albert Hall. In the mid-to-late 1970s, Cameron stopped acting for a time. He and his family moved to the Solomon Islands, as he sought to dedicate himself more fully to the Bahá’í faith. During this time, he ran an ice cream business in Honiara. Following the death of his wife, Audrey, in 1994, Cameron returned to the UK and resumed his acting career.\nHow Many Children Did Earl Cameron Have?\nIn 2007, the Baháʼí community hosted a reception in London to celebrate his 90th birthday.

Mr. Habeeb denounces the UK’s complicity in the humanitarian crisis unfolding in Gaza genocide and holds the government accountable for perpetuating the war crimes by supplying arms to Israel.\nDespite mounting evidence of war crimes and genocide casualties resulting from Israeli military attacks against civilians, the UK government has failed to take meaningful steps to halt arms exports to Israel. The types of arms and arsenal being sold or sent to Israel include advanced weaponry, ammunition, and military technology, which directly contribute to the oppression and subjugation of Palestinian civilians.\n“The UK government’s continued arms sales to Israel amid the ongoing genocide in Gaza is unconscionable,” said Sameh Habeeb. “By supplying weapons that are used to perpetrate violence and violate human rights, the UK government shares responsibility for the bloodshed and suffering inflicted upon innocent civilians in Gaza.”\nMoreover, Mr. Habeeb condemns the Labour Party’s silence on the issue, particularly its leadership and MPs who have failed to demand an immediate halt to arms exports to Israel. Labour MP James Murray’s inaction and refusal to support a ceasefire in Gaza are particularly egregious, leaving Ealing North residents deeply disappointed and angered.\n“I have spoken with residents of Ealing North who are appalled by the Labour Party’s lack of action and leadership on this critical issue,” stated Sameh Habeeb. “Labour has shown a blatant disregard for peace in the Middle East and has adopted a double standard in its approach to human rights. James Murray’s silence speaks volumes about his priorities and his failure to stand up for justice and human rights. Ealing North residents told me that they will ensure to punish Murray in the next general election.”\nMr. Habeeb further emphasizes that James Murray’s failure to condemn the Israeli genocide in Gaza suggests a lack of independence and moral courage, as he appears to prioritize loyalty to Labour leader Keir Starmer over the interests of his constituents.\n“James Murray MP should have the courage to speak up and represent the constituents who gave him their mandate,” Mr. Habeeb asserted. “It is high time for him to denounce the Israeli genocide in Gaza and demand an immediate halt to arms exports, regardless of potential ramifications from his party leadership.”\nAs an independent candidate for Ealing North, Sameh Habeeb pledges to be a vocal advocate for justice and peace in Palestine and other parts of the world. He calls on the UK government to prioritize human rights over arms sales and urges Labour Party leadership and MPs to demonstrate moral courage by demanding an immediate cessation of arms exports to Israel.\nMillions across the country especially in Ealing north were shocked of the pro genocide statements stated by Keir Starmer at LBC radio where he said “I think that Israel does have that right.” Starmer also told Nick Ferrari of LBC that it is “acceptable for Israel to withhold power and water from citizens in Gaza.” despite such pro genocide statements the local MP James Murray did not make any position to refuse what his leader said.\nFor media inquiries or further information, please contact:",

His suicide at Ealing Broadway station is a stark reminder of a system failing those of us who need it most.\nThis isn’t just a personal story; it’s the collective narrative of Ealing’s residents who endure the consequences of social and economic disparities, often exacerbated by the failures of the dominant parties.\nYears of witnessing the status quo and the current MP’s lack of tangible progress, we demand change. We need a system that prioritizes the well-being of its citizens, a system that actively combats injustice and inequality. The current state is unacceptable. It’s time to break free from the cycle of unfulfilled promises. It’s time for a new vision, a new voice to champion the needs of the community.\nMy heritage is woven with a profound respect for those who have walked the path before us. In my culture, caring for the elderly isn’t just a duty, it’s an act of reverence.\nWitnessing the plight of seniors in Ealing who struggle with basic necessities – a lack of specialized housing, inadequate care home options, and insufficient support for home modifications and in-home care – has ignited a burning passion within me.\nThe silence in the face of these challenges is deafening. The current MP’s track record, marked by a complete absence of progress on these critical issues, is simply unacceptable.\nI stand here not with empty promises, but with an unwavering commitment to fight for the rights of every individual in our constituency. This isn’t just about ticking boxes; it’s about ensuring a life of dignity and well-being for all residents in Ealing North.",

  "https_samehhabeeb_uk_/https_samehhabeeb_uk_people_ealing-people_asma-fawaz-al-assad/content_127.html": "Asma Fawaz al-Assad, born Akhras 11 August 1975) is a woman who has survived the best and worst of the strongest and the weakest sides of power. Married to Bashar al-Assad, former President of Syria, 2000–2024, Asma’s existence represents the synthesis of privilege, ambition, and notoriety. Born to Syrian parents in London, her story of transformation from potential investment banking greatness in the UK to the middle of quite the tumultuous Syrian political landscape has been noteworthy in many ways. Let’s find out more about the life of Asma Al Assad.\nEarly Life and Education\nAsma was born to Dr. Fawaz Akhras, a cardiologist of some renown, and Sahar Akhras, a retired diplomat. The parents are Sunni Muslims, from Homs, which has deep cultural roots in Syria. She grew up at Acton, London, and went to Twyford Church of England High School before attending the very prestigious Queen’s College for girls.\nThen she went to King’s College London to study computer science. She completed her Bachelor of Science degree in 1996. She received excellent preparation. Moreover, it later served to assist Asma in acquiring a positioning position in the finance and political jungle.\nGrowth in Politics\nAsma was an accomplished figure within the finance sector before entering Syria’s political arena. She served as an economic analyst at Deutsche Bank, in which she managed hedge fund operations across Europe and East Asia. In 1998, she joined J.P. Morgan’s investment banking division, specializing in firms that were exposed to the biotechnology and pharmaceutical sectors.\nAsma’s keen analytical mind, coupled with great business acumen, had fetched her accolades, and she was all set to leave for Harvard to do her MBA. But then a family vacation to Damascus in the year 2000 brought her in contact with Bashar al-Assad, a very distant acquaintance of the family. That changed plans dramatically.\nBecoming Syria’s First Lady\nBashir al-Assad succeeded to the presidency of Syria in December 2000 following the death of Hafez al-Assad. In the same year, Asma married Bashar, throwing her into public limelight as the First Lady of Syria. No one had taken them out as it was so shocking since everybody knew that they loved each other.\nAsma’s life in the West and her background as a Sunni brought with it hope that reforms would indeed be progressive within Syria. Asma traveled up and down throughout the country and visited more than 100 villages to understand what Syrians wanted, and that helped her build the Syria Trust for Development network of charitable organizations in the cause of education, women’s rights, and rural development.\nControversy and Political Turmoil\nWhile initially viewed as reform-minded, Asma’s role in the Syrian political landscape quickly gained her many detractors. Her closeness to the regime was under a lot of criticism for being highly oppressive. In 2011, Vogue ran a fawning profile of Asma headlined “A Rose in the Desert,” making her sound like the ultimate insiderly progressive figure.\nAs Syria plunged into civil war, Asma said little. In 2012, when she finally spoke out to the international media, she said things that reinforced perceptions of her complicity in the regime’s actions and statements defending her husband’s leadership.\nRevival and Political Interest\nBy 2020, Asma regained at least partial influence in Syria. Her nongovernmental foundation, the Syria Trust for Development, resumed its work, and a number of activists of this organization acquired membership in the parliament, which has raised her political status. However, fights with powerful figures like Rami Makhlouf have shed light on the power game inside the regime.\nObservers have been speculating about Asma’s agenda. Her supporters argue that she was attempting to create a new position for herself as a substitute leader, in particular within the framework of the Sunni majority. Ex-insiders claim that from her previous fringe position, Asma had gained a central role within the Assad regime.\nLegal Issues and Health Crisis\nAs of 2021, the Metropolitan Police in London launched an investigation into claims that Asma incited terrorist acts during the Syrian civil war. This adds another layer to her already very controversial legacy.\nOn the personal front, Asma has been battling serious health problems. In 2018, she was diagnosed with breast cancer and later this year announced that she was cured of the disease in 2019. However, in May 2024, acute myeloid leukaemia was discovered in her and she was taken out of public life.\nThe Fall of the Assad Regime\nAssad was getting opposition, and the last one was Bashar al-Assad’s ousting on 8 December 2024. Politics and violence were getting hot, but Asma fled Syria to Russia with her three children in November 2024.\nThe UK government declared Asma unwelcome while she held dual citizenship. Asma’s exit marked the end of her twenty-year tenure as Syria’s First Lady in the most dramatic of ways.\nPersonal Life and Legacy\nThe marriage of Asma and Bashar al-Assad that promised reform in its early days ended amid political turbulence and international condemnation. The couple has three children, and Asma’s role as a mother sometimes dominated state-sponsored narratives meant to humanize the regime.\nBehind all the scandals lies the story of a woman who navigated complex identities, powers, and aspirations. Her legacy remains highly divisive-to some an inspiration for early philanthropic efforts, to others, an accomplice to the regime’s atrocities that Assad carried out.\nThe Legacy and Controversy of Asma al-Assad\nLife itself is the greatest symphony, very turbulent; the case of Asma Fawaz al-Assad in the present scenario stands as historical complexity within the contradictions and contrasts-from the promising career on London’s Wall Street to being the heart in the center of this regime currently being charged for war crimes committed against the Syrian nation.\nWhether she is a reformist who lost her way or became an active member of her husband’s oppressive government, the Asma al-Assad story will constitute one of the more interesting pages in the story of the Middle East.",
  "https_samehhabeeb_uk_/https_samehhabeeb_uk_people_ealing-people_chris-patten-from-ealing-to-global-statesmanship/content_85.html": "Christopher Francis Patten, Baron Patten of Barnes, KG, CH, PC. He was born on 12 May 1944, is a British politician who was the Chairman of the Conservative Party from 1990 to 1992, and the 28th and last Governor of Hong Kong from 1992 to 1997. He was made a life peer in 2005 and served as Chancellor of the University of Oxford from 2003 to 2024. He is one of two living former governors of Hong Kong, alongside David Wilson. Patten was born in Thornton-Cleveleys in Lancashire and later brought up in west London. He graduated in history at Balliol College, Oxford, and, following his graduation in 1965, he went to work for the Conservative Party.\nEarly Life and Education\nPatten was born in Thornton-Cleveleys in Lancashire, where his mother had fled to from Exeter, which had recently been significantly damaged by the Baedeker raids. Patten grew up in an Irish Catholic family in west London, the son of an unsuccessful music publisher whose ancestors had come to England from County Roscommon, Ireland. Patten’s father, Frank, dropped out[6] of the university to become a jazz-drummer, later, a popular music publisher. Frank and his mother, Joan, were sent to Our Lady of the Visitation Roman Catholic primary school in Greenford and won a scholarship to St Benedict’s School, an independent school in Ealing, West London, at which he later won an exhibition for reading Modern History at Balliol College, Oxford.\nMember of Parliament: 1979-1992\nPatten stood as the Conservative Party candidate for Lambeth Central in the February 1974 general election. However, Patten lost against Marcus Lipton, of the Labour Party. In the general elections, Patten served as a member of parliament of the Bath area between 1979 and until his loss of a seat in the 1992 election.\nIn June 1983, Patten was appointed Parliamentary Under-Secretary for the Northern Ireland Office. He became a Minister of State in the Department of Education and Science in September 1985, and Minister for Overseas Development at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in September 1986.\nIn 1989, he was promoted into the Cabinet and became Secretary of State for the Environment, also taking responsibility for the unpopular Community Charge, nicknamed the “Poll Tax”. Though he stoutly defended the policy at the time, in his 2006 book Not Quite the Diplomat (published in the United States as Cousins and Strangers: America, Britain and Europe in the New Century) he says he thought it was a mistake on Margaret Thatcher’s part. He also introduced, and steered through Parliament, the major legislation that became the Environmental Protection Act of 1990.\nWho Was the First British Governor of Hong Kong?\nIf Patten had been re-elected in 1992, sections of the media thought he would have been rewarded by appointment as Foreign Secretary, although in his autobiography John Major said that he would have made Patten Chancellor of the Exchequer.\nPatten turned down offers of a new post and instead, in July 1992, he became the 28th and the last governor of Hong Kong until its transfer of sovereignty to China on 30 June 1997. He was given an official Chinese name, Pang Ding-hong a name with an etymology based on the words “stability” and “calm; joyous; healthy”. Unlike most previous Hong Kong governors, he was not a career diplomat from the UK Foreign Office although he was not the first former MP to become a governor of Hong Kong.\nPatten’s tenure faced several different challenges, as many in Hong Kong were still reeling from the Tiananmen Square massacre a few years earlier. However, the general public regarded him positively. He made efforts to reach out to the people of the colony and was famous for his habit of walking around Hong Kong as well as in the media spotlight. Hongkongers called him Fat Pang making him the only governor to have a widely recognized Chinese nickname\nEuropean Commissioner: 1999–2004\nHe served as one of the two United Kingdom members appointed to the European Commission in 1999 to serve as the Commissioner for External Relations where he was in charge of the development and cooperation programs of the Union as well as liaised with Javier Solana, who was the then High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy. He served in this role for the Prodi Commission from 23 January 2000 to 22 November 2004.\nPatten managed several crises related to European foreign policy, most famously when the European Union was unable to devise a collective unified policy before the Iraq War in 2003. He was nominated for the office of President for the next Commission in 2004 but was unable to muster the support of France and Germany.\nWikiLeaks states that Patten had been in Moscow in April 2004, and he had just finished holding EU–Russia ministerial consultations in Brussels. He thought the EU was being too dependent on Russian energy supplies, and needed to get closer to the Caucasus and Central Asia so it could diversify its supplies. Patten was the greatest advocate in the commission for Turkey’s accession to the European Union.\nIn February 2010, Patten was appointed President of Medical Aid for Palestinians, but he resigned in June 2011. In 2014 Pope Francis made Patten head a body advising the Vatican on a media strategy as well as on how to handle the press, which he continued through until 2016.\nIs Chris Patten married?\nIn 1971, Patten married Lavender Thornton, a barrister, on 11 September. They have three daughters, including the actress Alice Patten. On 29 September 2005, he published his memoirs, Not Quite the Diplomat: Home Truths About World Affairs. In October 2009, Patten was Chief Guest at The Doon School, a boarding school in Dehradun, India, which is a member of the United Kingdom’s Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference.\nIs Chris Patten Catholic?\nPatten is a Catholic and managed the visit of Pope Benedict XVI to the United Kingdom in September 2010. In 2010, The Tablet named him as one of Britain’s most influential Catholics.",

She is the daughter of the Iranian political satirist and poet Hadi Khorsandi. Her family moved to the United Kingdom from Iran after the 1979 revolution, and she often draws on her Iranian roots and responses to them in her stand-up comedy. Khorsandi became a national figure following her 2006 Edinburgh Festival Fringe Show, Asylum Speaker.\nEarly Life and Education\nShaparak Khorsandi was born on 8 June 1973 in Tehran. Her parents were Fatemah and the satirist and poet Hadi Khorsandi. The family fled Iran to London after the Islamic Revolution after her father made a joke that was seen as critical of the revolutionary regime. Khorsandi graduated in 1995 from King Alfred’s College, now the University of Winchester, with a degree in drama, theatre, and television. After graduating, she worked in various roles such as community theatre and a sandwich shop, phone fundraiser, and nude life model while starting as a stand-up comedian. In 2010 the university graduated her with an honorary doctorate.\nWhy did Shappi Khorsandi change her name?\nAfter people mocked and mispronounced her full name as a child, she chose to be known by the shortened form “Shappi” from age 16, but then she felt this was an effort “to bend in a direction which would make my foreignness more comfortable for other people” and instead reverted to her full name.\nWho is Mark Steel’s girlfriend?\nHe was married to Natasha Steel until 2016. In 2022 he was dating fellow comedian Shaparak Khorsandi and has described their relationship as “always entwined.”. In October 2023, Steel stated that he was undergoing surgery following a diagnosis of throat cancer.\nWho is the female comedian with the ADHD book?\nComedian Shaparak Khorsandi talked about her ADHD and her book “Scatterbrain\nFrom which origin is the name Khorsandi?\nKhorsandi is a Persian surname, Iranian.\nWho is Shappi Khorsandi married to?\nIn 2005, she married fellow comedian Christian Reilly, and they had a son together before divorcing in 2011. Her daughter was born in June 2013; the following year she told an interviewer that they were not in contact with the girl’s father, “But that’s fine; I’m not angry or bitter about it.” As of 2022, she was in a relationship with fellow comedian Mark Steel.\nWhich Religion Does Shappi Khorsandi Follow?\nKhorsandi was raised without any religion and identifies as an atheist. She later became a patron of Humanists UK, which appointed her as its president for a three-year term beginning in January 2016, succeeding Jim Al-Khalili. She became a vice president of the organization in 2019, a role she retained as of 2023. In 2017, she came out as bisexual and wrote that she had gone on marches in support of gay rights since she was 17, “Despite all those years of marching and getting drunk at Pride, officially coming ‘out’ as bisexual seemed like too much of a fuss.” Khorsandi was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder at age 47, which she discussed in a 2023 autobiography.\nFamous Book: Beginner’s Guide to Acting English\nKhorsandi’s memoir, A Beginner’s Guide to Acting English, was published by Ebury Press in 2009. The book describes how she experienced England as a young girl. The narrative begins with her attending The Kings’ International Nursery School with her brother Peyvand. Throughout the book, she explains how the Persian language differs from English: “They called me ‘poppet.’. Iranians said ‘jaan’ or ‘azizam.’. Other themes include her experiences with English food and customs. Historian Sharif Gemme felt that “while one can hear her distinctive, resonant voice reaching the punchlines at the end of the paragraphs, the final result is not impressive: neither particularly amusing nor genuinely observant.”\nSecond Book: Nina is Not OK\nHer second book, the first novel ever, was Nina is Not OK, released in 2016. This is her work with an underage heroine having to deal with alcoholic abuse; she was also shortlisted for the Jhalak Prize, a new literary prize set up especially for Black, Asian, and minority ethnic writers. However, she requested that it be taken out of contention; she said of the book in one interview, “For once in my career I’d done something not about identity, and I get a sticker for being brown. In 2021, Khorsandi published a young adult novel of fiction titled Kissing Emma, based on the life of Emma Hamilton. Her autobiographical work Scatter Brain (2023) is subtitled How I Finally Got off the ADHD Rollercoaster and Became the Owner of a Very Tidy Sock Drawer.\nCareer in Comedy\nKhorsandi is a stand-up comedian who performed at Joe Wilson’s Comedy Madhouse in 1997. She often discusses her Iranian heritage and responses to her comedy routines. In 2000, she was a runner-up for the Hackney Empire New Act of the Year, and William Cook of the Guardian described her “feisty self-mockery” as “refreshing, with something new to say and a new way of saying it.”. She made her debut that summer performing at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in the three-person show Pablo Diablo’s Cryptic Triptych, sharing the stage between ventriloquist Mark Felgate and Russell Brand. She was shortlisted for the BBC New Comedy Award that same year.\nAppearance at the Melbourne Comedy Festival\nIn 2007, Khorsandi went to Australia and performed at the Melbourne Comedy Festival. After that, she was shortlisted for best breakthrough act at the 2007 Chortle Awards. In 2008, Khorsandi was one of the acts at The Secret Policeman’s Ball show for Amnesty International; writing in 2021, she reflected that the appearance “led to regular TV bookings, including Live at the Apollo.\nHer BBC Radio 4 program Shappi Talk (2009) had four themed episodes, each with comedy routines relating to her early life in the UK; the themes were racism, unconventional parents, religion, and growing up. The program included guests like Meera Syal.\nIn The Times, Chris Campling praised Khorsandi as “very funny” and described the show as addressing issues in a way that was “no mere retread of her general stand-up routine.”. Trevor Lewis of the Sunday Times called it “A comedy treat. Her second series, which explored themes of divorce, addiction, history, and politics, aired in 2010.",

His childhood revolved around the peaceful, serene beauty of rural England. However, when Jonathan was 14 years old, his family decided to sell that farm and migrated to Bury St Edmunds. It brought a very radical change in life and plans from Jonathan Green’s side.\nHe boarded at St. Joseph’s College in Ipswich.

He was an avid music collector who spent more than half a century producing music and programs for the airwaves. Anthony Philip Swern was born on 30 June 1948 in Ealing, London. At a young age, his love for music and radio guided him into a lifelong career.\nWhat was the illness of Phil Swern?\nOn 26 August 2024, Swern presented his Bank Holiday special Phil Swern’s Hidden Gems on Boom Radio, which proved to be his last radio broadcast, as he died five days later after suffering from cancer for a long time, at the age of 76 on 31 August 2024.\nWhich shows did Phil Swern record?\nEvery chart hit, please. From around 1973, Phil went on to write and produce dozens of hits by acts including The Pearls, R & J Stone, Blue Haze, Horace Faith, The Seashells, The Edwin Hawkins Singers, Duane Eddy, and Manhattan Transfer. He also wrote and produced Polly Brown’s big US Top 20 hit, Up In A Puff Of Smoke.\nWho is Phil, the director of SWERN?\nPhil Swern was born on 30 June 1948 in Ealing, London, England, UK. He was a writer and producer who had worked in That’s Showbusiness (1989), Bobby Davro on the Box (1985), and Popmaster TV (2023). Phil married Lynney. He died on 31 August 2024.\nEarly Career and Emergence in Music Production\nThe musical scene of the 1970s was lively, and that is where Phil Swern’s career started. His first recording production was with Horace Faith on “Black Pearl” in 1970 for Trojan Records. This record marked the start of a collaboration with some brilliant musicians and exciting projects. Works with artists like the Pearls, Polly Brown, and R&J Stone were examples that showed his skills in producing some memorable hits. Interestingly, R&J Stone’s 1976 single “We Do It” became a number 5 hit on the UK Singles Chart, making Swern one of the best record producers around.\nSwern and Johnny Arthey formed the studio group Blue Haze in 1972. The group’s reggae-influenced cover of “Smoke Gets in Your Eyes” gave them huge success worldwide, with it hitting number 27 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and number 32 on the UK Singles Chart. This was also how Swern could put different musical styles together to suit different kinds of audiences.\nRadio production proved to be the defining chapter of his career, during which Swern made himself a household name at BBC Radio. So dearly did the people love him that they dubbed him “The Collector” due to his unparalleled zeal for saving music history. Here, he produced iconic programs on both BBC Radio 1 and BBC Radio 2, which speak so well to generations of listeners.\nBroadcaster\nSwern also worked for broadcaster Bob Harris. He produced Harris’s Radio 1 shows in the early 1990s and his Saturday night show for Radio 2. His attention to detail in radio production has seen to it that he has always been widely enjoyed by both professionals and listeners alike.\nBesides being a part of music and radio work, Swern was involved in quiz shows; he co-wrote Pop the Question with Jeremy Beadle, and that’s Showbusiness with screenwriter Jeremy Pascall. This man showed his diversification and creativity through his new forms of music and entertainment but succeeded.\nThe genius of Swern in making the very popular Popmaster quiz feature for Ken Bruce on Radio 2 to make those challengingly interesting questions made this popular ingredient survive to great heights of success. Later it was done by Neil Myners and Simon Bray, but the touch to make that ultimate form of question to sustain that show was only created by Swern.\nThe Complete Music Collector\nPhil Swern is a man born to compile music history. He compiled the only definitive collection in the world of every UK Top 40 chart hit since records began in 1952. Such an enormous effort attracted attention from other enthusiasts, but most importantly, it vindicated his passion for documenting the popular music past.\nSwern’s efforts for the cause of music history did not go unnoticed. In October 2010, he was awarded a BASCA Gold Badge for a major contribution to music, which meant that he would never be forgotten in the cultural sphere.\nLast Days and Legacy\nPhil Swern was still going strong at his old age, despite a long battle with cancer. On 26 August 2024, he broadcast a Bank Holiday special, Phil Swern’s Hidden Gems, on Boom Radio. That was an apt end to a great career: the presentation of some musical gems not previously heard by a wider audience.\nWhen Did Phil Swern Die?\nSwern died on 31 August 2024 at the age of 76. He marked the end of an era for British radio and music production. Colleagues, listeners, and artists immediately paid tribute as people began to realize just what incomparable contributions he made in the industry.\nLegacy\nLife has been music in all its forms for Phil Swern—a producer, collector, and innovator who spent his life sharing this joy with others. His influence transcends even his truly remarkable body of work, inspiring generations of radio producers, musicians, and music enthusiasts to follow in his footsteps.\nSwern’s legacy lives on through the programs he made, the artists he promoted, and the music he saved. To those who knew him or were touched by his work, Phil Swern will always be remembered as a true champion of music and broadcasting.\nWhat did Phil Swern do at BBC Radio?\nPhil Swern created some of the most popular BBC Radio shows: Pick of the Pops and Sounds of the 60s. He was associated with such great presenters as Brian Matthew, Bob Harris, and Ken Bruce and played a role in creating the best programs to honor music history.\nWhy is Phil Swern known as “The Collector”?\nHe was known as “The Collector” due to his collection of every UK Top 40 chart hit since records started in 1952.

Strauss played county cricket for Middlesex and captained England in all formats of the game. He is a good left-handed opening batsman, with a preference for backfoot shots, by which he mainly cuts and pulls the ball. He was also known for his fielding strength at slips or in the covers.\nWhy is Andrew Strauss a sir?\nStrauss has been knighted by Queen Elizabeth in 2019 for his services to sports and charity with the Ruth Strauss Foundation, having followed in his footsteps of opening partner Alastair Cook to the recognition of Buckingham Palace.\nWhat happened to Andrew Strauss’ wife?\nIn early 2018, Ruth Strauss, wife of Sir Andrew Strauss, the former England cricket captain, was diagnosed with an incurable lung cancer that affects non-smokers. Ruth died on December 29th, 2018; she was 46 years old and mother to two children, then aged 10 and 13.\nIs Andrew Strauss dating?\nEx-England cricket captain Andrew Strauss, 46, looks bowled. The former England cricket captain, 46, was seen embracing Antonia Linnaeus Peat as they left an exclusive. It is understood that Strauss and the PR executive, who is 18 years younger than him, have been in a relationship for several months.\nWho is Andrew, a retired cricketer?\nAndrew Strauss. Sir Andrew John Strauss OBE (born 2 March 1977) is a cricket administrator and former player who is the former ECB Director of Cricket. He played county cricket for Middlesex and captained the England side in all forms of the game.\nDebut\nStrauss made his first-class debut in 1998 and his One Day International (ODI) debut in Sri Lanka in 2003. He gained popularity when he made his Test match debut, replacing the injured Michael Vaughan at Lord’s against New Zealand in 2004. With scores of 112 and 83 (run out) in an England victory and the Man of the Match award, he became only the fourth batsman to score a century at Lord’s on his debut and was close to becoming the first Englishman to score centuries in both innings of his debut.\nStrauss again nearly scored two centuries (126 and 94 not out) and was named man of the match in his first overseas Test match, in Port Elizabeth, South Africa, in December 2004. He had a slump in form during 2007, and as a result, he was dropped from the Test squad for England’s tour of Sri Lanka and declared that he was retiring from cricket.\nEducation and early life\nStrauss moved to the UK when he was six years old. He spent most of his early life at Caldicott School, a preparatory school for boys in Buckinghamshire. Later on, he went to Radley College, which is a public board school for boys in Oxfordshire.\nHe pursued postgraduate studies in economics at Durham University. He did his dissertation on supermodular games. Besides playing for the university team, he also played for the Hatfield College side. One of his teammates there was the cricket statistician Benedict Bermange. Strauss also represented the university rugby club as a flyhalf. He began playing in the third XV but soon made it to the second XV. His coach at the university was Graeme Fowler, who finally managed to convince Strauss to play cricket only.\nCareer\nHe spent several early years of his cricketing career in the cities of Sydney and Adelaide in Australia, during which time he briefly played first-grade cricket alongside Australian bowler Brett Lee. During his time in Australia, he met his future wife, actress Ruth McDonald, whom he married in October 2003, and lived in Marlow with their sons, Sam (born 4 December 2005) and Luca (14 July 2008). On 29 December 2018, Ruth died after a battle with a rare form of lung cancer. After Ruth’s death, Andrew contacted former Ashes opponent Glenn McGrath, who himself had been widowed by cancer when Glenn’s wife Jane, a native of Paignton, Devon, had died of breast cancer.\nAfter Jane’s demise, Glenn formed the McGrath Foundation for combating breast cancer and, as his first official supporter, secured a partnership between this foundation and the Sydney Test by hosting Jane McGrath Day as day 3; the stumps, players, and clothes that the crowd used were pink. Since he had passed through one Pink Test in 2011, Strauss and his Ruth Strauss Foundation ensured that Day 2 of the Lord’s Test became another identical sister event in preparation for the 2019 Ashes.\nNew Zealand and South Africa tour England\nStrauss’s innings of 177 saw him automatically retain a place in the side for the next series against the same opponents. While still overlooked for the One Day International team, he was restored to his position of Test opener alongside Alastair Cook and Michael Vaughan, going back down to number 3. In the first rain-affected match at Lords, he continued his form with a slow but steady 63 in the only England innings of the match.\nIn the second Test, Strauss made another 60 before getting out, giving England a decent start following a big first innings total. He then went on to make 106, chasing 294, in the second innings on a now difficult batting wicket, which set England up to win by 6 wickets to take a 1-0 lead in the three-match series. This was Strauss’s second Test century at Old Trafford; the first had come against Australia in 2005, also when Strauss scored 106. In the third and final Test at Trent Bridge, he made 37 in England’s only innings as England went on to win the series 2–0. He was man of the series for his 266 runs at an average of 66.50.\nCaptaincy\nStrauss became the captain on 7 January 2009, after a publicized rift between ex-captain Kevin Pietersen and Peter Moores. Pietersen then resigned as captain after just 3 Test matches, and Moores was sacked. This was in succession to a recovery in form in the 2008 Test Series in India; England lost and drew their two games there.\nIn his first match as regular captain, against the West Indies at Sabina Park, Strauss and his team failed, with Strauss scoring 7 and 9 as England were bowled out for 51 in the second inning to lose by an innings.

Habeeb noted that James is “misleading” Muslim voters by just visiting Islamic centres or mosques to help the branding of his campaign particularly after his anti ceasefire positions.\nDespite being entrusted with the responsibility of addressing the concerns of all constituents, Murray’s lack of genuine interaction and questionable stances have left the Muslim community feeling marginalized and disenchanted.\nHabeeb who met representatives of the Muslim Community in Ealing north noted that there are Key grievances raised by the Muslim residents of Ealing North include:\n- Lack of Meaningful Engagement: James Murray’s tenure has been characterized by a superficial approach to engaging with the Muslim community. While he may make sporadic visits to Muslim centers and mosques for photo opportunities, his interactions lack substance and fail to address the pressing issues faced by Muslim residents on a day-to-day basis.\n- Opposition to Gaza Ceasefire: Many Muslim residents express deep disappointment with Murray’s public stance against a ceasefire in Gaza during times of conflict. His position contradicts the values of peace and humanitarianism cherished by the local Muslim population, further eroding trust in his ability to advocate for their interests effectively.\n- Failure to Address Muslim-Specific Concerns: Murray has shown a lack of commitment to addressing issues specific to the Muslim community, such as Islamophobia, religious discrimination, and cultural integration.\nHis neglect of these critical issues has fueled frustration and disillusionment among Muslim residents, who rightfully expect their elected representative to champion their rights and well-being.\nIn response to Murray’s inadequate representation and tokenistic gestures towards the Muslim community, Sameh Habeeb calls upon mosques and Islamic centers in Ealing North not to allow James Murray and other MPs/candidates to exploit places of worship for election gains.\nHabeeb emphasizes the importance of holding elected officials accountable and rallying behind candidates who genuinely seek to address the concerns of all communities within the constituency.\n“It is time for the Muslim residents of Ealing North to demand authentic representation and proactive engagement from their elected representatives,” said Sameh Habeeb.\n“We cannot afford to be placated by empty gestures and photo opportunities. I urge mosques and Islamic centers to stand in solidarity with their community members and support candidates who are committed to advocating for their interests.” He added\nAs the UK General Election approaches, Sameh Habeeb calls upon Muslim voters in Ealing North to consider his candidacy as a voice of integrity and inclusivity in Parliament.\n📍 For media enquiries or to schedule an interview with Sameh Habeeb, please contact:",

He is known for originating the role of Joseph in Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber’s musical Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, his performances in several high-profile West End plays and musicals, and his portrayal of protagonist John Grant in the Australian film Wake in Fright (1971).\nWho was Gary James Bond?\nBond was born in the village of Liss, Hampshire, England, the first child of his parents. The army was a career that anyone in the family was destined for; his father and many uncles were in the army. As a result, it was always assumed that he would follow in this tradition, and his family frequently persuaded him that this was his career path. Yet Bond, from a young age, had always harbored a love for acting.\nEducation and Passion for Acting\nHe was educated at Churcher’s College in Petersfield and later Portsmouth College of Technology. His father died in December 1956 when Bond was just 16, and as a result, the young Bond was able to pursue his preferred path without any interference from family members. After leaving education, he moved to Johannesburg, South Africa, for a gap year.\nHowever, he quickly returned to England, as he won a scholarship at London’s prestigious Central School of Speech & Drama. While there for three years, he received several awards, including the Margaret Rawlings Cup, shared with Angela Morant, and the Elsie Fogerty Prize for the Best Individual Performance by a Man.\nEarly Career\nAt 23, Bond received his first acting job with the Connaught Theatre, Worthing. He made his stage debut in the play Not in the Book and then performed in Doctor in the House as Dr. Simon Sparrow.\nIn 1962, the big break came when he featured as Pip in the Royal Court’s production of Arnold Wesker’s Chips with Everything. As directed by John Dexter, this was one of the theatrical landmarks of the 1960s. Due to this play’s huge success, he began his Broadway appearance the following year in 1963, when it was transferred.\nIn 1968 he joined the Prospect Theatre Company at an invitation made, where Bond was relishing in the prospect of appearing in classical roles when he appeared in many productions, including Sebastian in Twelfth Night, Sergius in Shaw’s Arms and the Man, and No Man’s Land.\nWhat were Gary Bond’s notable theatre performances?\nIn late August 1972, he created the role of Joseph in Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber’s musical Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat. Premiering at the Edinburgh International Festival by the Young Vic Theatre Company, it was directed by Frank Dunlop. He later joined the London production at the Albery Theatre to great acclaim. Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber composed a song for Bond called “Disillusion Me,” which he released as a single.\nSignificant theatre roles by Gary Bond include:\n-\n- Joseph in Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.\n-\n- Che Guevara in Evita.\n-\n- Various roles with the Royal Shakespeare Company, including Brutus in Julius Caesar.\n-\n- Leading performances in Much Ado About Nothing and Aspects of Love.\nFilms\nAlthough probably most famously an actor for the stage in England, he appeared in a variety of feature films. Following his screen introduction when he acted as Private Cole in Zulu (1964), he was Mark Smeaton in Anne of the Thousand Days (1969) and in the Australian Wake in Fright (1971).\nTelevision\n-\n- BBC production of War and Peace\n-\n- The Duchess of Malfi\n-\n- The Importance of Being Earnest\n-\n- The Highland Jaunt\n-\n- Frontier\n-\n- The Linden Tree\n-\n- Affairs of the Heart\n-\n- Wings of Song\n-\n- Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.\nWake in Fright\nAlthough his film output is small, consisting of only three films, Bond is perhaps best remembered for appearing in the Australian film Wake in Fright (occasionally renamed Outback) as teacher John Grant.\nA film version of Wake in Fright, based on the 1961 novel by Kenneth Cook, was already attached to actor Dirk Bogarde and director Joseph Losey as early as 1963, but Group W acquired the rights, hiring Canadian director Ted Kotcheff to make the movie.\nThe film was lost for decades until a print of it was found and, after being restored, it was seen to be in the Cannes Film Festival 2009 catalog on 15 May 2009 when it was chosen as a Cannes Classic title by the head of the department, Martin Scorsese\nWas Gary Bond Openly Gay?\nIn the theatrical profession, Bond was openly gay and, from 1969 to 1976, was the partner of actor Jeremy Brett. In Garry O’Connor’s 2019 biography of Ian McKellen, he mentions that the two were in a relationship early in both of their careers, but it came to an end in 1972 when Bond was about to open in Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.\nIn the same biography, a former lover of Bond said that\nHe was part of one of the first relatively out [gay] couples with Jeremy Brett, but theirs was an on-off liaison that lasted for years. Bond was irresistible, with an easy warmth of manner, wonderful humor, and sometimes a wicked sense of fun. He was divine, lovely, and wonderful in bed.\nIn the book Casting About: A Memoir, Agent David Graham mentions,\nHad it been within my power to choose, Gary Bond would have become my life’s companion. When Chips with Everything was brought to New York [which was in 1963], he was among the original British cast that came with it. Ashley-Steiner had been prevailed upon by his agent to do the job; I was just the lucky sod who was set to mind him. Young, blond, and attractive, he reminded me of the most handsome chap I had ever seen.\nHow Did Gary Bond Pass Away?\nBond died of AIDS-related causes on 12 October 1995 in Ealing Hospital at the age of 55. He had been with his partner, E.J. Taylor, for 16 years, and he died exactly one month after Jeremy Brett.",

  "https_samehhabeeb_uk_/https_samehhabeeb_uk_people_ealing-people_ho-chi-minh-from-ealing-to-revolutionary-leader-of-vietnam/content_106.html": "Hồ Chí Minh (19 May 1890–2 September 1969), commonly referred to as Uncle Ho (Bác Hồ), was a Vietnamese revolutionary and politician who served as the founder and first president of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam from 1945 until he died in 1969 and as its first prime minister from 1945 to 1955. Ideologically a Marxist–Leninist, he founded the Indochinese Communist Party in 1930 and its successor, the Workers’ Party of Vietnam (later the Communist Party of Vietnam), in 1951, serving as the party’s chairman until his death.\nWhere Was Ho Chi Minh Born?\nHe was born in the province of Nghệ in French Indochina and learned French. From 1911 to the present, he worked in several foreign countries, and in 1920 he was a co-founder of the French Communist Party in Paris. After studying in Moscow, Hồ founded the Vietnamese Revolutionary Youth League in 1925, which he transformed into the Indochinese Communist Party in 1930.\nWhat is Ho Chi Minh known for?\nOn his return to Vietnam in 1941, he founded and led the Việt Minh independence movement against the Japanese, and in 1945 led the August Revolution against the monarchy and proclaimed the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. After the French returned to power, Hồ’s government retreated to the countryside and began guerrilla warfare in 1946.\nWhat is the connection of Ho Chi Minh with Britain?\nThành (Hồ) had lived in West Ealing between 1913 and 1919, according to his various claims, then later in Crouch End, Hornsey. He allegedly worked as either a chef or dishwasher (accounts differ) at the Drayton Court Hotel in West Ealing. Allegations that he was apprenticed as a pastry chef to Auguste Escoffier at the Carlton Hotel in Haymarket, Westminster, are not borne out by any surviving documents. Nevertheless, the façade of New Zealand House, which is the home of the New Zealand High Commission and now occupies the site of the Carlton Hotel, bears a blue plaque. In 1913, Thành was also working as a pastry chef on the Newhaven–Dieppe ferry route.\nPolitical Education in France\nHồ Chí Minh, 1921, under the alias Nguyễn Ái Quốc, attending a Communist congress in Marseille, France. Thang (Ho) developed some interest in politics between 1919 and 1923, especially when staying in France, under the influence of his friend and comrade Marcel Cachin, from the French Section of the Workers’ International. Thành stated he had traveled to Paris from London in 1917, but French police records show only documentation of his entry to France in June 1919. Citing the principle of self-determination before the peace accords, they asked the allied powers to end French colonial rule of Vietnam and ensure the formation of an independent government.\nWhat is the role of Ho Chi Minh in the independence movement?\nIn 1941, Hồ Chí Minh returned to Vietnam to lead the Việt Minh independence movement. Hồ and ICP founded a communist-led united front to oppose the Japanese. The Japanese occupation of Indochina that year, the first step toward an invasion of the rest of Southeast Asia, created an opportunity for patriotic Vietnamese. The so-called “men in black” were a 10,000-member guerrilla force that operated with the Việt Minh.\nHe oversaw many successful military actions against Vichy France and the Japanese occupation of Vietnam during World War II, supported closely yet clandestinely by the United States Office of Strategic Services and later against the French bid to reoccupy the country (1946–1954). He was imprisoned in China by local authorities of Chiang Kai-shek before he was rescued by Chinese Communists.\nElection as president\nThe Geneva Conference in 1954 ended the war between France and the Việt Minh. The latter’s forces could regroup in the North, while anti-Communist groups settled in the South. Hồ’s Democratic Republic of Vietnam moved to Hanoi and became the government of North Vietnam, a Communist-led one-party state. After the Geneva Accords, there was supposed to be a 300-day period in which people could move freely between the two regions of Vietnam, later known as South Vietnam and North Vietnam.\nIn the 300 days, Ngô Đình Diệm and CIA adviser Colonel Edward Lansdale mounted a campaign to persuade Northerners to move to South Vietnam. The campaign was specifically targeted at Vietnam’s Catholics, who would provide Diệm’s power base in his later years through the use of the slogan “God has gone south.” Between 800,000 and 1 million people migrated to the South, most of whom were Catholics. In early 1955, French Indochina was dissolved, leaving Diệm in temporary control of the South.\nPersonal Life\nHồ Chí Minh was a politician, writer, journalist, poet, and polyglot. His father was a scholar and teacher who received a high degree in the Nguyễn dynasty Imperial examination. Hồ was taught to master Classical Chinese at a young age. Before the August Revolution, he often wrote poetry in Chữ Hán, the Vietnamese name for the Chinese writing system.\nOne of those is Poems from the Prison Diary, composed when he was incarcerated by the police of the Republic of China. This poetical chronicle is Vietnam National Treasure No. 10 and has been translated into many languages. It is used in Vietnamese high schools. Upon gaining independence from France, the new government favored only Chữ Quốc Ngữ (the Vietnamese writing system in Latin characters) to eradicate illiteracy.\nHow did Hồ Chí Minh’s time in exile shape his life?\nAs he was in exile for nearly 30 years, Hồ could speak fluently as well as read and write professionally in several different languages, including French, Russian, English, Cantonese, and Mandarin, as well as his mother tongue, Vietnamese. In addition, he was reported to speak conversational Esperanto.\nIn the 1920s, he was bureau chief/editor of many newspapers that he established to criticize the French Colonial Government of Indochina and serve communist propaganda purposes. Examples are Le Paria (The Pariah), first published in Paris in 1922, and Thanh Nien (Youth), first published on 21 June 1925 (21 June was named by the Socialist Republic of Vietnam Government as Vietnam Revolutionary Journalism Day).\nDeath\nWith the outcome of the Vietnam War still in question, Hồ Chí Minh died of heart failure at his home in Hanoi at 9:47 on the morning of 2 September 1969; he was 79 years old. His embalmed body is currently on display in the President Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum in Ba Đình Square in Hanoi, despite his will, which stated that he wanted to be cremated.",

  "https_samehhabeeb_uk_/https_samehhabeeb_uk_people_ealing-people_peter-crouch-ealings-iconic-forward-and-his-unique-footballing-journey/content_107.html": "Peter James Crouch is a former professional footballer from England, born on 30 January 1981. He was capped 42 times by the England national team between 2005 and 2010, scoring 22 goals for his country during that time, appearing at two FIFA World Cups. He is one of 33 players to have scored 100 or more Premier League goals and jointly holds the record for the most headed goals in Premier League history. A tall forward with a slender physique, Crouch was known for his aerial abilities, technical abilities, and hold-up play.\nEarly Life and Education\nHe was born in Macclesfield, Cheshire, but moved with his family to Singapore when he was a year old. This came about after his father Bruce, from Fulham, had accepted a position with a Singaporean advertising agency. The Crouch family spent three years in Southeast Asia before moving back to England when Bruce rejected the chance to work in Australia.\nThey spent some time at a YMCA in Tottenham before eventually settling in Harrow on the Hill. Roxeth Primary and North Ealing Primary were where Crouch started his education, and he continued playing for Northolt Hotspurs. He was later drafted into the Brentford Centre of Excellence in 1991, and he also played for the boys club West Middlesex Colts whilst attending Drayton Manor High School.\nClub Career\nTottenham Hotspur\nPeter Crouch began his career at Tottenham Hotspur in 1998, but not in the first team. He was loaned out to Dulwich Hamlet and IFK Hässleholm of Sweden; from the last that he was loaned to he would leave.\nQPR and Portsmouth\nIn 2000, Crouch moved to Queens Park Rangers for £60,000 and scored ten league goals in his first season. QPR got relegated, and he joined Portsmouth for £1.5 million, where he scored 18 league goals in the 2001–02 season.\nAston Villa and Southampton\nAston Villa signed him in 2002 for £5 million. He was loaned to Norwich City, with whom he only played a handful of games because he could not maintain consistency in his game.\nIn 2004, Crouch joined Southampton, where he played regularly and scored 16 goals in 2004–05, the first time England called him.\nIn 2005, he was transferred to Liverpool for £7 million. The player enjoyed a very tricky start; then he helped the club win the FA Cup during the 2006 season. He went on to net several crucial matches for both league and European fixtures, among those scoring a treble against Arsenal.\nInternational Career Youth International Success\nThe international career of Peter Crouch started with the England under-20 team while he represented them in the 1999 FIFA World Youth Championship. Playing with some good mates like Ashley Cole and Andrew Johnson, the team, however, ended their tournament before the group stages without even a single goal score. Moving on to the under-21 team, Crouch marked his entry into the world of international sports by scoring for the 2002 European Under-21 Championship.\nHe made his debut for the full England side when Sven-Göran Eriksson was on a visit to the U.S. in May 2005. However, due to initial skepticism from the fans, he had to wait until March 2006 and score an international goal against Uruguay to shut his critics’ mouths.\nEuro 2008 Qualifying and Capello Era\nCrouch played very well during the Euro 2008 qualifiers, scoring 10 goals in one calendar year. That is a feat few achieve nowadays in football. England missed out on qualification despite his efforts. Under Fabio Capello, Crouch played mostly each game, collecting 22 goals in 42 appearances, with two of those very important in the 2010 World Cup qualifiers.\nWorld Cup Appearances and Later Years\nIn the 2010 World Cup, Crouch came in as a substitute but could not get much playing time. Though his opportunities in England decreased after 2010, he was always ready for international action. Although he did not play in UEFA Euro 2012, Crouch said that he was eager to play for England.\nWhat is the playing style of Peter Crouch?\nPeter Crouch is a tall forward with a lean body. He was very good on the first touch and a scorer. Despite his height, all those criticisms of Crouch regarding his early career of being the worst at heading, lacking speed, power, and athleticism did prove wrong in the end since he ended up as the Premier League’s record holder for most headed goals. He can notably hold up the ball and link play, a sort of target man or striker.\nWhat is the nickname of Peter Crouch?\nCrouch has some well-cherished loving nicknames: Crouchy, RoboCrouch, and creative Crouchinho. The Spanish commentators began to resort to labeling him with nicknames as Pantera Rosa and Mr. Roboto.\nWho Made the Robot Dance Famous?\nThe robotic dance by Crouch became an iconic dance during the summer of 2006, inspired by a party at David Beckham’s house. First used in England’s friendly against Hungary, the celebration was dear to the fans’ hearts. Crouch later retired from the dance, promising to reserve it for big moments. True to his word, he brought it back for his 100th Premier League goal in 2017 to confirm his status as a footballing entertainer.\nHow many Children does Peter Crouch Have?\nIn December 2005, at a nightclub, Crouch met Abbey Clancy, who was a model at a nightclub. He married Clancy on 30 June 2011, about six weeks after the birth of their first child. They have two daughters and two sons: Sophia Ruby born in March 2011, Liberty Rose born in June 2015, Johnny born in January 2018; and Jack, born in June 2019.\nCharges and Allegations\nIn August 2012, Crouch pleaded to the charge of driving at dangerous speed from November 2011 and was punished with a total of fines and costs of £1,365. In September 2012, Crouch had his driving privileges revoked for six months and was penalized with 12 penalty points as well. Failing on two instances to give the particulars of his vehicle driver led him to accept fines and costs of £1,585 also.",

  "https_samehhabeeb_uk_/https_samehhabeeb_uk_people_ealing-people_henry-fielding-the-father-of-the-english-novel-and-his-legacy-in-ealing/content_78.html": "Henry Fielding (22 April 1707–8 October 1754) was an English writer and magistrate known for the use of humor and satire in his works. His 1749 comic novel The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling was a seminal work in the genre. Along with Samuel Richardson, Fielding is seen as the founder of the traditional English novel. He also played an important role in the history of law enforcement in the United Kingdom, using his authority as a magistrate to found the Bow Street Runners, London’s first professional police force.\nWho was Henry Fielding?\nHenry Fielding (1707-1754) was a novelist. He is attributed with the establishment of the modern English novel along with the novelist Samuel Richardson. His novels are funny and satirical, belonging to the picturesque and mock-heroic genres. The most famous ones are The History of the Adventures of Joseph Andrews and His Friend, Mr.\nWhat was Henry most known for?\nHenry Fielding was an English novelist and playwright of the Restoration period and the founder of London’s first police force, the Bow Street Runners.\nEarly life\nHenry Fielding was born on 22 April 1707 at Sharpham Park, the seat of his mother’s family in Sharpham, Somerset. He was the son of Lt.-Gen. Edmund Fielding and Sarah Gould, daughter of Sir Henry Gould. A scion of the Earl of Denbigh, his father was the nephew of William Fielding, 3rd Earl of Denbigh.\nEducated at Eton College, Fielding started a lifelong friendship with William Pitt the Elder. His mother died when he was 11. A suit for custody was brought by his grandmother against his charming but irresponsible father, Lt. Gen. Edmund Fielding. The settlement placed Henry in his grandmother’s care, but he continued to see his father in London.\nMarriages\nFielding married Charlotte Craddock in 1734 at the Church of St Mary in Charlcombe, Somerset. She died in 1744, and he later modeled the heroines of Tom Jones and Amelia on her. They had five children; their only daughter, Henrietta, died at the age of 23, having already been “in deep decline” when she married a military engineer, James Gabriel Montresor, some months before. Three years after Charlotte’s death, Fielding ignored public opinion by marrying her former maid Mary Daniel, who was pregnant. Mary bore five children: three daughters who died young and two sons, William and Allen.\nRole as a Judge and Magistrate\nDespite the scandal, Fielding’s consistent anti-Jacobinism and support for the Church of England led to his appointment a year later as Westminster’s chief magistrate, while his literary career went from strength to strength. Most of his work concerned London’s criminal population of thieves, informers, gamblers, and prostitutes. Though living in a corrupt and callous society, he became noted for impartial judgments, incorruptibility, and compassion for those whose social inequities led to crime. The income from his office (“the dirtiest money upon earth”) dwindled as he refused to take money from the very poor. Joined by his younger half-brother John, he helped found what some call London’s first police force, the Bow Street Runners, in 1749.\nSuccess as a Dramatist and novelist\nHis masterpiece is The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling (1749), a scrupulous comic novel with elements of the picaresque and the Bildungsroman, telling a complicated story of how a foundling came into a fortune. The novel tells of Tom’s alienation from his foster father, Squire Allworthy, and his sweetheart, Sophia Western, and his reconciliation with them after lively and dangerous adventures on the road and in London. It triumphs as a presentation of English life and character in the mid-18th century. Every social type is represented, and through them, every shade of moral behavior. Fielding’s varied style tempers the basic seriousness of the novel, and his authorial comment before each chapter adds a dimension to a conventional, straightforward narrative. Some of his notable works include:\n-\n- Joseph Andrews\n-\n- Amelia\n-\n- The correspondence of Henry and Sarah Fielding\n-\n- The Temple Beau\n-\n- The Tragedy of Tragedies\n-\n- Shamela\n-\n- The Author’s Farce\n-\n- Grub Street Opera\nWhy is Henry Fielding called the father of the English novel?\nOne of his major contributions to the English novel was a sense of structure to its development. With his Tom Jones, Fielding introduced a new kind of fictional hero: a good-hearted, well-intentioned young man with ordinary human weaknesses, one who yields to temptation with women and makes errors in judgment.\nWhat is Fielding’s concept of the novel?\nFielding combines a positive assertion of the strength of goodness and benevolence (demonstrated by the structure and plot of the novels) with the sharp thrusts of the satirist’s attack upon the hypocrisy and vanity of individual characters.\nWho is the father of novels?\nLegacy. Sir Walter Scott called Henry Fielding the “father of the English novel,” and the phrase still indicates Fielding’s place in the history of literature.\nHow many plays did Henry Fielding write?\nFielding attended Eton College but left early and lost his family’s support. In his 25 plays, all written early, he was essentially a satirist of political corruption; because of his sharp commentary, he was eventually effectively banished from the theatre, whereupon he took up the study of law.\nWhat are the two novels of Henry Fielding?\nHis famous novels include Apology for the Life of Mrs., The History of the Adventures of Joseph Andrews and his Friend, Mr. The Life and Death of Jonathan Wild, the Great—1743, an ironic treatment of Jonathan Wild, a notorious underworld figure of the time.\nWhy did Henry Fielding write Shamela?\nFielding immediately responded to the very popular novel by writing Shamela (1741) and Joseph Andrew (1742). Using mockery, irony, and satire as literary motifs and tools, Fielding could counterattack the fame Pamela had gained among readers of the era through these novels.\nHow did Henry Fielding die?\nFielding’s humanitarian commitment to justice in the 1750s (for example, in support of Elizabeth Canning) coincided with rapid deterioration in his health. Gout, asthma, and cirrhosis of the liver left him on crutches, and with other afflictions, sent him to Portugal in 1754 to seek a cure, only to die two months later in Lisbon, reportedly in pain and mental distress. His tomb there is in the British Cemetery (Cemitério Inglês), the graveyard of St. George’s Church, Lisbon.",
  "https_samehhabeeb_uk_/https_samehhabeeb_uk_people_ealing-people_charlotte-cooper-sterry-ealings-trailblazer-women-in-the-tennis-world/content_109.html": "Charlotte Reinagle Cooper Sterry (22 September 1870–10 October 1966) is arguably one of the most iconic figures in the history of tennis. She was the winner of five Wimbledon singles titles and the first female Olympic tennis champion, who broke barriers and set standards for generations of athletes.\nEarly Life and Introduction to Tennis\nCharlotte Cooper was the youngest daughter born to Miller Henry Cooper and Teresa Georgiana Miller on 22 September 1870, in the home known as Waldham Lodge in Ealing, Middlesex, England. Part of her youth included playing tennis, with training during the early formative stage conducted at Ealing Lawn Tennis Club. Initial coaching from those pioneers who really formed her early skills came from H. Lawrence, Charles Martin, and Harold Mahony.\nWhy is Charlotte Cooper important?\nCharlotte Cooper was the first Englishwoman to win five singles titles at Wimbledon and became the first female athlete to earn a gold medal at the Olympic Games in 1900. This makes Charlotte Cooper an influential figure in the history of women’s sports.\nThe most significant victory for Cooper was at Ilkley in 1893, when she was crowned the singles champion there. Cooper indeed enjoyed a great career. She played in her first Wimbledon tournament, the same year she triumphed at Ilkley and reached the semi-finals. For the next 24 years, Cooper played in 21 editions of Wimbledon and emerged as one of the best players in the game.\nWimbledon Supremacy\nCooper’s first Wimbledon singles title came in 1895 when she staged a remarkable comeback to defeat Helen Jackson in straight sets after trailing 0–5 in both sets. She defended her title in 1896 by defeating Alice Simpson Pickering. Her rivalry with Blanche Bingley Hillyard dominated the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with the two alternating as champions between 1897 and 1901.\nCooper Sterry returned to Wimbledon in 1908, after a seven-year absence. Now a mother of two herself, at the age of 37, she was the oldest-ever winner of the singles event when she won against Agnes Morton in the final. Her eight consecutive singles final appearances record continued to be the longest until such time that it was equaled by Martina Navratilova in the year 1990, when the latter equaled this feat of eight in nine successive singles final appearances.\nOlympic Glory\nThe 1900 Summer Olympics were held in Paris, an event that would introduce women to the games. Cooper Sterry aimed to take up this opportunity and make history. On July 11, 1900, Cooper Sterry defeated Hélène Prévost of France and secured the women’s singles category to become the first women’s Olympic tennis champion and the first individual woman Olympic champion in all other sports.\nShe combined with Reginald Doherty to take the mixed doubles title. Cooper Sterry also had two straight-set victories against Prévost and Harold Mahony, thereby ensuring her a place in history as one of the precursors to women’s tennis.\nSuccess Beyond Wimbledon\nApart from these victories at Wimbledon and the Olympics, Cooper Sterry claimed numerous singles titles during major championships, including the Irish Lawn Tennis Championships in 1895 and 1898, German Championships in 1901, and the Swiss Championships in 1902. In addition, she also dominated mixed doubles with seven All-England titles. Seldom, therefore, is there seen her endurance in competitive tennis. She played until the 50s and, as late as in 1913, won the final of Wimbledon’s first women’s doubles alongside Dorothea Douglass.\nPersonal Life and Legacy\nOn 12 January 1901, Charlotte married solicitor Alfred Sterry, who became the president of the Lawn Tennis Association. Cooper Sterry died on 10 October 1966, aged 96, in Helensburgh, Scotland. Cooper Sterry has been named for her contributions to tennis through induction into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 2013.\nHow many children does Charlotte Cooper have?\nCharlotte Cooper has two children. The first is Rex Sterry, who held positions in leadership within the sport of tennis. Rex was vice-chairman of the All England Club, while Gwen followed her mother into the competition at Wimbledon and for her country in the Wightman Cup.\nWas Charlotte Cooper Deaf?\nCooper Sterry had been deaf since the age of 26. She had never allowed her disability to surpass her abilities as far as playing the sport was concerned. Many people have drawn inspiration from her strength and determination.\nPlaying Style and Impact\nCooper Sterry is a player in a league above her time. She must have been one of the earliest female players to serve overhead. This also means that Cooper was an attacking player. And the volley skills, tactical consciousness, and consistent temperament made this lady a superb player.\nShe was a pioneer in women’s tennis. Her achievements paved the way for generations of players. She proved that women’s existence could be on the world circuit, breaking barriers and paving the way for others.\nGrand Slam Record\nIn Cooper Sterry’s career, she played 11 singles matches in the finals of Grand Slams. She won five singles matches. Among these wins:\n-\n- 1895: Won her first Wimbledon title in the final, defeating Helen Jackson Atkins\n-\n- 1896: Again Conquered the second time, successive Wimbledon title defeating Alice Simpson Pickering\n-\n- 1898: Third time became Wimbledon Champion after winning by beating Louisa Martin.\n-\n- 1901: Was a bit luckless when losing the first title from Blanche Bingley Hillyard.\n-\n- 1908: Crushed Agnes Morton for her first success in more than ten years. And took up her fifth title in the most prominent singles match.\nWhat is the relationship between Cooper and Charlotte?\n“Cooper” was Charlotte’s maiden name, for she married Alfred Sterry and became Charlotte Cooper Sterry after being born Charlotte Reinagle Cooper. She was not only a tennis champion but a trailblazer who redrew the rules of what women could achieve in sports. She played for more than two decades, exemplifying excellence, resilience, and innovation.\nFrom dominance at Wimbledon to historic Olympic victories, Cooper Sterry’s legacy will continue to inspire athletes around the world. She was one of the first female superstars in the sport and left a mark on tennis that will never be forgotten. She is also a symbol of determination and grace.",

  "https_samehhabeeb_uk_/https_samehhabeeb_uk_people_ealing-people_eleanor-harrison-the-ealing-based-tv-presenter-and-wildlife-advocate/content_105.html": "Eleanor Harrison is born on 17 November 1977. This is one of the best-known television presenters in England and has a deep love for the environment and its engaging story. Helen Fisher The most known for co-presenting the popular BBC program Countryfile since 2009 is Harrison’s journey from her rural upbringing to one of the most respected in broadcasting.\nWhen and where was Eleanor Harrison born?\nEleanor Harrison was born to a carpenter father and a midwife mother. Her childhood was spent in the picturesque Gloucestershire countryside, just outside of Cirencester. Nature surrounded the family as they looked after fruits and vegetables from their garden, reared chickens, and enjoyed the country lifestyle. This was an early foundational love that lasted a lifetime in the great outdoors and wildlife.\nShe was doing her training from her primary level in Sir William Romney’s School, Tetbury. She then moved further for A-levels in Cirencester College; that was the time when she gained interest in the biological world and started off with her career.\nShe was seeing Nathan Hutchings, the son of actor Geoffrey Hutchings. She spent time visiting Zimbabwe by utilizing her then-boyfriend’s father’s contacts, where she met the diversity and complexity of wildlife and came out with greater respect for wildlife. This new experience made her resolve further to work in fields that would celebrate and protect nature.\nWho is Eleanor Harrison, and what is she best known for?\nHer journey towards this new career was not straightforward or without a glitch. When she moved to seek a fresh way of living with country music going up as a growing interest for her too, Eleanor somehow managed a string of dead-end short-term jobs. That took her to Channel 5 and a secretary job that gave her a tumbler into television.\nIt was shortlisted to the screen hosting Milkshake, who threw up her first breakthrough role. Although she had turned it down at the time, shortly afterward, she was handed it when she was chosen to fill in for Michaela Strachan when that presenter went out on maternity leave, working on Michaela’s Wild Challenge. She presented a wildlife adventure series, which won a children’s BAFTA. It was quite the watershed in Harrison’s television career, and so much on-screen personality and talent emerged.\nShe later turned out to be a freelance television presenter. Harrison covered all the television networks, including BBC, ITV, Channel 4, Channel 5, and the Discovery Channel. She had a passionate love for the natural world. She connected with audiences by making use of her gift. She has produced many shows that will make her one of the most knowledgeable yet approachable persons on television.\nTelevision Career Highlights\nHarrison’s portfolio stands out as quite brilliant and full of remarkable programs displaying his versatility with interests in nature and science alike. Other interesting features include:\nCountryfile\nHarrison joined the BBC flagship, and this is 2009, at once making her a household name since she told the stories that involved country living in them as well as other environmental factors and social resilience. Harrison was one of the anchormen who made Countryfile one of the UK’s top-rated television programs.\nSecret Britain\nShe is a co-presenter of this show, broadcast by BBC One since 2015, that takes viewers on treasure hunts of hidden treasures in Britain and gets more of the adventure out while better understanding the landscape\nDinosaur Britain\nShe presented a two-part documentary broadcast on ITV in 2015, narrating the UK’s prehistoric periods.\nBritain’s Sharks and Britain’s Whales\nThis 2016 documentary for ITV took Harrison underwater, where she met several of the beautiful ocean creatures seen along Britain’s coastline.\nHosting shows on Discovery Channel, which have Daily Planet and Outrageous Acts of Science, to BBC’s series: The Great British Winter.\nOther than television, leading positions define Harrison’s passion for conservation. In December 2014, she became the president of the Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust after succeeding Sir Henry Elwes, thus confirming her place in ensuring that the real world is preserved.\nA Presentation Expert\nBesides hosting charity events, like the Countryfile Ramble for Children in Need, Harrison also presented live programs from different grounds, such as Countryfile Live at Blenheim Palace. As part of early programming for the 2017 new year, she revealed her other, lighter side with an opportunity to dance and sing for a special country music routine coming from Countryfile for BBC’s Children in Need.\nIndeed, Harrison has managed to balance work with her personal life even under this tight schedule. She has recently returned to Countryfile following maternity leave in 2016; that itself is proof she can manage her family and job well simultaneously.\nWhy did Eleanor Harrison leave Countryfile in 2023?\nAs of October 2023, after working with the Countryfile family for over thirteen years, Harrison concluded her time by stating that this would be the last series to which she dedicated her time with her family and newer opportunities. These are new journeys that the excited audiences will certainly look forward to.\nWho is Eleanor Harrison married to, and how many children does she have?\nEleanor Harrison’s private life, much like hers, is earthy and family-related. In 2005, she married Matthew Goodman and had two daughters and a son. Always balancing the career with her family, there is no surprise Harrison left Countryfile, and that’s where the devotion lies: with the closest people.\nLegacy and Impact\nDespite her busy schedule, Harrison has still managed to maintain ties to her Gloucestershire roots. Indeed, her presidency of the Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust underscores her longstanding passion for the countryside and drive to make valuable contributions to home region conservation.\nEleanor Harrison is an extremely talented, resilient, and dedicated career woman who has come out victorious in her career. She has witnessed everything from rural Gloucestershire to one of the best favorite television presenters inspiring many viewers to cherish and protect nature.\nShe inspires future broadcasters and future conservationists because of how nicely she brings up education, entertainment, and advocacy. Be it the sharp storyline on Countryfile, the adventurously enthralling shows on Secret Britain, or doing something for conservation activities in Gloucester, Harrison created a permanent milestone both on media landscapes and by environmental activism.",
