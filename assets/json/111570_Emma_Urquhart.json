  "https_colehill_gov_uk_councillors_cllr-emma-urquhart_/https_colehill_gov_uk_about-colehill_history/content_2.html": "Emerging from a small hamlet, where little had changed since medieval times, Colehill saw significant expansion in the Victorian era. Largely due to the arrival of the railway, Wimborne became prosperous and the rich of South East Dorset sought to make their homes on large estates on the slopes of Colehill.\nSo began the development of the village as a community. Notably, the Village School in Middlehill was founded in 1865. Ten years earlier a Primitive Methodist Chapel had been built (replaced in 1913 by the Methodist Church in Lonnen Road). The Anglican Church started as a “Tin Tabernacle” in 1881 and was in use temporarily until St Michael’s and All Angels was built in 1893. The Parish Council was formed in 1896, and met in Glyn’s Coffee Tavern in Colehill Lane.\nAs part of Colehill Parish Council’s centenary celebrations a commemorative booklet was produced called “100 Years of the Civil Parish of Colehill 1896-1996”.

In addition traffic related matters were the most common issues raised in your free format comments.\nBased on this we have initiated discussions with Dorset Council to understand their process for installing new crossings. There are a lot of steps to go through to determine whether any particular site qualifies for a crossing, including counting the numbers of pedestrians and cars in the vicinity, and taking account of the number of accidents and the difficulty of crossing the road. If a site qualifies then it has to wait for funding to become available, which may take some time.\nYour Feedback\nOur thanks to the 95 people who responded to our recent request on this site for residents to let us know whether they would like us to pursue the possibility of pedestrian crossings being installed on Middlehill Road, and if so at what locations.\n- 92% (87 people) said they support the idea of pedestrian crossings on Middlehill Road.\n- 5% (5 people) object to any pedestrian crossings being constructed.\n- 3 people gave no opinion, but raised other points.\nOn possible locations, people suggested the following sites:\n- near St Michael’s church for the Middle school (16 people)\n- near the co-op (19 people)\n- near the pharmacy (17 people)\n- near the library (6 people)\n- near Colehill first school (15 people)\n- near Cutlers for Hayeswood school (16 people)\nWe will use this feedback in our discussions with Dorset Council to understand the feasibility of installing crossings and to select the most appropriate sites for assessment.",

All Town and Parishes throughout England are required by law to hold an Annual Parish Meeting, which must take place between 1 March and the 1 June (inclusive). Meetings should not commence before 6pm.\nWhat is the purpose of the Annual Parish Meeting?\nThe purpose of the meeting is to give local organisations including the Parish Council an opportunity to let local residents know what they have been doing over the past year. The meeting is also an opportunity for electors to have a say on anything they consider valuable to the people of the Parish.\nWhat else happens at the meeting?\nThe meeting can also be an opportunity for local groups, clubs, societies and other voluntary and statutory organisations to provide an exhibition and/or have representatives from the group address those present at the meeting about the work they do and what they are involved in.\nWho can attend the meeting?\nThe Annual Parish Meeting is for all electors of the Parish. It is not a meeting of the Parish Council. Anyone is welcome to attend the meeting however, only registered electors of the parish may speak and vote during the meeting.\nWho will chair the meeting?\nIf the Chair of the Council is in attendance then they are legally entitled to chair the meeting. The Colehill Annual Parish Meeting is usually convened by the Chair of the Council however, the meeting could also be convened by any two Parish Councillors, a Councillor representing the Parish on the District Council, or any six local electors of the Parish.\nWill I be able to ask questions and make suggestions?\nAny registered elector may ask a question of the Council which will usually be answered by the Chair, the Clerk or the Council, or a designated Councillor. An elector may also make a suggestion and comment on anything pertinent to the residents of the Parish. This will be welcomed and is the whole purpose of the meeting.\nWill Parish Councillors be at the meeting?\nAll Parish Councillors will be invited to attend and Councillors will also have an opportunity to raise questions and make comments if they wish. However, the purpose of the meeting is to enable the electors to find out what is going on in their parish and to have their say.\nWill minutes of the meeting be taken?\nMinutes of the proceedings of the Annual Parish Meeting shall be drawn up and entered in a book provided for the purpose. The minutes shall be reviewed and signed at the next Annual Parish Meeting.\nHow long will the meeting last?\nThe length of the meeting is dependent on the number of electors present, the number of questions asked and the discussion that is raised. Generally, the meeting will not last longer than two hours.\nWhere can I get copies of papers for the meeting?\nThe agenda calling the meeting is published 7 clear days before the meeting. The agendas and any accompanying documents will be available to download from the website on the Agendas page or by contacting the Parish Clerk on clerk@colehill.gov.uk or 01202 880049.",

  "https_colehill_gov_uk_councillors_cllr-emma-urquhart_/https_colehill_gov_uk_climate_free-trees-for-colehill-residents/content_251.html": "OUR FREE TREE GIVEAWAY WAS ON SATURDAY 25th NOV 2023\nColehill Parish Council again offered free trees to Colehill residents this year as part of our action plan for the Climate Emergency.\nResidents were able to collect a tree from The Reef from 1:30pm to 4pm on Saturday 25th November as part of our joint community event with Colehill Community Library who held a book sale at the same time.\nThe trees provided were cell-grown saplings, ranging from approximately 15cm-60cm in height, so are easy to carry away by hand. Numbers of each variety are limited and will be given out on a first come first served basis. Unfortunately for trees this size it’s possible that 10% might not grow but if your tree was unsuccessful this time and your tree didn’t grow, don’t worry we plan to offer more trees in future years.\nFor help with planting and caring for your tree, see the guidance from the Woodland Trust on How to Plant a Tree\nTree Varieties\nSubject to availability you could choose from the varieties of tree shown below, click on each tree name for further details.\nSilver birch is a popular garden tree. Tolerant of a range of temperatures, it thrives in dry woodlands, downs and heaths.\nBeautiful blossom and a bounty of bright red fruits. Wild cherry , one of the prettiest native trees, is relished by gardeners and wildlife.\nRowan (Sorbus aucuparia)\nRowan grows well in light acidic soils, reaching an average height of 15m. Twigs are slender and purple-grey with purple hairy buds. Bark is greyish silver with dark horizontal markings. Clusters of white flowers appear in late spring with orange-scarlet berries in autumn. Leaves have 15 serrated leaflets arranged in pairs with a single leaf at the tip.\nHawthorn Trees & Hedges (Crataegus monogyna)\nHawthorn is an amazing tree for wildlife gardens and can be planted as a hedge or single tree. It has beautiful pink-white blossom in May and ruby-red berries, called haws, in summer. The appearance of the May blossom was the herald of the end of winter and the beginning of summer.\nHazel Trees & Hedges (Crataegus monogyna)\nIn spring, hazel is laden with pretty ‘lambs tail’ catkins and in autumn it produces nuts popular with wildlife. This tree responds well to close pruning. Hazel is also distinguished in legend as a magical tree that provides protection.\nDogwood Trees & Shrubs (Cornus sanguinea)\nGrow this plant for its shimmering crimson and orange winter stems. In spring it has creamy white flowers and in autumn its leaves turn red. Dogwoods generally grow well (and look great) in front of an evergreen hedge where nutrients, water and sunlight are in short supply for other species.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nHere are some frequently asked questions about our free tree scheme…\nQ: How big are the tree saplings?\nA: The trees being provided are cell-grown saplings, ranging from approximately 15cm-60cm in height, depending on variety, so easy to carry away by hand.\nQ: Is winter the best time to plant a tree?\nA: Yes, the Woodland Trust say the best time to plant tree saplings is during winter as the trees need to be dormant when planting into new soil.\nQ: I will be at work during the collection times, can someone else collect a tree on my behalf?\nA: Yes you can nominate a friend, neighbour or family member to collect your tree on your behalf.\nQ: Can I choose my tree species?\nA: Yes, we have 6 types of tree available, as listed above, and you can pick which one you want, subject to availability.\nQ: Why did Colehill Parish Council provide free trees?\nA: This is one of our actions to help tackle the climate emergency. Trees are one of the best options available to offset CO2, the trees we’re giving away will when mature offset approximately 15 tonnes of CO2 per year, equivalent to the emissions from a car driving c. 70,000 miles.\nQ: How can we afford to give the trees away?\nA: The trees are heavily subsidised by the Woodland Trust and their sponsors.\nQ: Who are the Woodland Trust?\nA: The Woodland Trust are the UK’s largest Woodland Conservation Charity. They have planted 43 million trees since 1972, and aim to plant 10 million more trees every year for the next 5 years.",

The fungus is prevalent at the base of the tree and there are signs of it extended up the trunk, which increases the chance of failure at root level and higher up the tree.\nIn anticipation of the tree needing to be felled, a number of years ago a replacement beech was planted nearby. The canopy of the replacement tree has now grown up to the diseased tree’s canopy. It is appropriate that the younger healthy replacement is not impaired by the older diseased tree as their branches converge, with the likelihood of an imbalanced canopy developing on the young tree.\nA lime tree located at the south western side of the offices, which overhangs the car park will also be removed. The lime tree has been losing leaf cover for some time with significant deadwood posing a risk.\nThe tree felling work is weather dependent and will be delayed if there are high winds or heavy rainfall.",

Given the high response rate from the Household Survey this seems low, however 99 people in the Household Survey said that they also either own a business in Colehill or work in Colehill so it’s possible that responses had already been received for many of our local businesses.\n- Given the small number of responses no statistical analysis will be meaningful.",

The mobile networks started to rollout 5G in 2019, and it is currently available in over 100 towns and cities across the UK.

They work towards awards which require a thorough understanding of survival, rescue and sports skills as well as life support and water safety elements.\nTeen Swim Fitness is for swimmers who have reached a good standard of swimming but no longer wish to attend structured lessons but would like to keep their fitness at a good level.\nThis session runs for 1 hour on a Wednesday 5.30pm – 6.30pm where the swimmers follow set programmes to build their stamina and fitness whilst the instructor keeps an eye on their technique and gives tips to improve efficiency.\nThis session also compliments swimmers who are still attending lessons if they would like to swim more than once a week.\nAdult Swimming Lessons\nAdult lessons are for any level of swimmer, and all our current adult swimmers have made a huge amount of progress this term. Being able to swim confidently is life changing.\nFor our beginners, the smile on their faces, and sense of achievement when they manage their first length unaided, is something a teacher won’t forget, and is a feeling the swimmers will remember for a long time to come.\nFor our intermediate and advanced swimmers – getting that step closer to achieving their goal of swimming an open water events or learning a new stroke with correct aquatic breathing is hugely satisfying\nAqua Exercise\nIt’s not just your heart and muscles that benefit from an aquafit class; it’s also fantastic for your internal organs and lymphatic system. Working out in water reduces impact and stress on joints and strain on the heart. It is also beneficial whilst recovering from injury and illness. Exercising in water is easier than on land and from the start one is able to exercise for longer and more strenuously while staying cool.\nAnd if you’re COOL, it’s FUN!\nAll of these benefits contribute to the “feel good factor” and our classes are suitable for men and women of all shapes, sizes, and any fitness level, promoting a wonderful sense of wellbeing.\nRemember the more you push yourself the better the results will be!\nCome along on a Monday 7.00pm – 7.45pm or on a Wednesday 2.00pm – 2.45pm and have a go.\nFirst session free then £5.50 per session.

Choir practice starts at 7.30pm and finishes around 9pm when everyone gathers together for refreshments and a good natter where ideas on the choir’s repertoire are exchanged (plus lots of other things totally unrelated!).\nThe choir is run by a Colehill resident, Susan Davies, and is led by choir master, Peter Coole, who is a retired music teacher and a member of the Bournemouth Symphony Chorus. Professional pianist, Barry Groves, joined the choir as accompanist in September 2014. Both Peter and Barry write and arrange music for the choir and together with Susan, all work on a voluntary basis.\nThe music is very varied with songs from the shows, popular songs, some choral pieces as well as everything in between. There are no auditions, you don’t have to be able to read music, the choir is open to anyone who just enjoys singing irrespective of age or experience.\nThe cost is just £2.00 per week for adults and £1.00 for under 16’s. This covers the cost of all music, a ring binder for your music and refreshments. The choir makes a monthly payment out of funds to St. Michael’s Church for the use of the wonderful Arts and Crafts building.\nWe perform at concerts at least 3 times a year and all are in support of local charities or community projects. We often have professional singers and musicians performing with us, which greatly enhances our programmes and can present us with some quite challenging pieces from time to time.\nThe choir isn’t just about singing. It is about the friendships that have been made, the special occasions that are celebrated, the holiday tales that are shared. We will find any excuse to have a get-together and one member has nicknamed us “the cup-cake choir” because of our collective love of cakes and bakes!\nAt least twice a year the choir will meet together at a social event especially at Christmas and then again in August for our summer party, after which we will have a short break returning refreshed in September.\nWe are always looking for new members, especially men to join our tenor and bass sections. If you are interested, please call Susan Davies on 01202 842311 or email colehillcommunitychoir1@gmail.com. Colehill & Ferndown Community Choir started in September 2012 and has matured into a wonderful group of people who make some fabulous music together.

Upon investigation, Enforcement Officers found evidence within the fly-tips that linked the waste to the offender.\nSpurdle was subsequently located, interviewed and reported to appear in court last Wednesday (18 April) where he pleaded guilty and was fined a total of £1,588.14 for his crimes.\nJeremy Gallagher, Enforcement Officer for the Dorset Waste Partnership (DWP), said:\n“We’re obviously pleased with this conviction and would like to thank our colleagues at South Somerset District Council’s Enforcement Team for their assistance in the investigation.\nI hope this case demonstrates that fly-tipping will not be tolerated in Dorset or Somerset. By working with neighbouring councils as well as residents, we can work more effectively to clamp down on fly-tippers and stop this anti-social, illegal and dangerous activity that costed Dorset tax-payers £150,000 last year alone.”\nThis conviction comes as the DWP launch their new ‘Tip-Off’ anti-flytipping campaign, which encourages Dorset residents to report fly-tipping incidents and provides important information on how you can prevent your waste being fly-tipped.",

The future positioning of this activity will be reviewed once the immediate threat has passed and normal meetings have resumed.\nThe environmental improvement ideas and actions agreed so far are as follows:\nThings Colehill Parish Council are doing:\n- We will consider the environmental impact in all future decisions and actions taken by Colehill Parish Council.\n- We will minimise our use of single-use plastics, including stopping the purchase of plastic bottles of water, Councillors will drink tap water and/or bring their own drinks to meetings in re-useable containers.\n- All local organisations receiving Grant Aid payments will be asked to complete an Environmental Questionnaire to help us shape our policies\n- Colehill Parish Council are offering free trees for residents. 630 trees were given out in December 2020, a further 525 distributed in October 2021 and 420 in both November 2022 and November 2023. This project is very well received by residents and we hope to continue this going forward whilst the demand is there.\nThings individuals in Colehill can do:\n- Recycle as much of your waste as possible:\n- Check what items will be collected in your fortnightly household recycling bins.\n- See what items can be taken to the Wimborne Recycling Centre (Tip)\n- Most types of plastic bags and soft plastic wrapping can now be recycled at the Colehill Co-op or Tesco in Ferndown.\n- If you’re not sure how to recycle any item, check the Recycle Now pages.\n- Switch to LED light bulbs, they use a lot less electricity and last a lot longer, so they save you money as well as helping the environment.\n- Switch to a Green Renewable Energy Supplier, to reduce your carbon footprint, use bigcleanswitch.org to obtain quotes from green energy suppliers.\n- Contact Healthy Homes Dorset for free impartial energy advice via an advice line open Monday-Friday, 9am-6pm, on 0300 003 7023. They can also provide free loft and cavity wall insulation to people that qualify.\n- Contact Renewable Heat Incentive for information on renewable heat technologies.

The first year has been a triumph thanks to the guidance of retired librarian Linda Roberts who co-ordinates and supports the forty plus volunteers.

Annette Brooke MP who has supported the library ever since it was first threatened, was there, as was Michael Tomlinson, (prospective Conservative parliamentary candidate).\nThe Colehill Community Choir performed magnificently for us and there was a display of the history of the library, a local views quiz, a book sale and coffee and cake for everyone – including some local authors who came along show their support. A delightful cake made specially by Lyn Nelsey was the main raffle prize.\nFRIDAY NIGHT IS MUSIC NIGHT\n1st November 2013 at Colehill Memorial Hall\nFriday Night is Music Night was organised by Maureen and Paul Edwards – they invited their folk singing friends to perform to an audience of around 70.

We have closely monitored our performance over four regular collections to allow the crews to get used to their new rounds and areas before reviewing the changes, as is common practice when rounds are changed.\nWhile the majority of the new rounds have been introduced successfully, we are fully aware that a number are being regularly delayed, which is clearly unacceptable.\nAdditional resources have now been put in place to assist the crews in those affected areas, ensuring residents get their waste collected on the correct day. In the meantime, any missed collections will be picked up as soon as possible. Please keep your bins outside your property where possible if your collection appears to have been missed. We have also identified where extra help is needed going forward and will introduce extra resources from Thursday 29 September.\nRest assured, we are taking all necessary actions to restore a good service to these areas. We will continue to review the affected rounds and keep a close eye on our performance.\nAgain, please accept my apologies for any inconvenience you may have experienced.\nYours sincerely,\nKaryn Punchard\nDirector\nDorset Waste Partnership",

Local people enjoy the finest and latest films available and with full surround sound.

The feedback from artistes and agents backs up the claim to this phenomenal success.\nThe Tivoli Theatre would not be what it is today without its army of volunteers.

However many species are under threat due to human consumption, pollution, climate change and population growth.\nWhat can parish councils do to help biodiversity?\nParish councils, like all public authorities in the UK, have a legal duty to consider conservation of biodiversity when carrying out their functions. This includes:\n- Ensuring public access to high quality open spaces including the ability to designate land as Local Green Space.\n- Protecting green belt land and safeguarding the countryside from encroachment.\n- Maintaining green corridors, to prevent neighbouring areas from merging.\n- Conserving and enhancing the natural environment through the protection of valued landscapes.\nHow can you help us improve biodiversity in Colehill?\nColehill has a wide range of biodiverse habitats, including trees, hedges, grassland, woodland and wetlands which gives it a very special appeal. We know many residents are concerned about the potential impact from future housing developments on these habitats.\nWe look forward to hearing your ideas for how biodiversity in Colehill can be safeguarded and improved. This could include for example, improvements to existing wildlife sites, creating new sites, providing additional habitats (such as bird & bat boxes), improving wildlife corridors between sites, or seeking to protect specific areas from development.\nPlease let us know what your think using our online Feedback Form.",

Excavations are taking place despite the Council asking users not to continue digging below the water table and disturbing tree roots so soil piles will be made available for new additions to the track.\nUpdate – October 2023\nSt Michael’s Dirt BMX and mountain bike track is situated in Coombes Wood at Smugglers Lane, opposite Merrifield. The site is now open following remedial works and the safety inspector and insurer being happy with the current management of the site.\nUpdate – March 2022\n- At the start of lock-down, March 2020, we closed The Dirt BMX track in Coombes Wood in line with government guidance and erected closure signs.\n- At about the same time we became aware that the site had become unsafe for a number of reasons:\n- Several of the jumps had been extended beyond the safe height limits agreed with the insurer.\n- A number of large excavations had been dug without permission, undermining tree roots.\n- Drainage channels had been installed without permission, diverting the water, causing some areas to flood, and threatening the trees and biodiversity of the site.\n- Some of the excavations were in close proximity to badger setts, activity which is illegal as badgers and their setts are protected by law.\n- In 2021 we took the decision to keep the site closed and took steps to disable the take-off platforms while we considered how best to make the site safe.\n- In recent weeks we found that the closure signs had been removed, and a number of people were using the site again without permits, which would leave us uninsured in the event of an accident.\n- We then found that many of the jumps were in a poor state of repair and starting to collapse. On closer inspection we found the jumps had been built with wooden logs inside which are now rotting and falling out, making most of the jumps now unsafe and unrepairable in their current form.\n- We have therefore taken steps to make the site safe, reducing most of the jumps in height, removing the rotting logs from inside, and erecting new closure signs.\nYour Feedback on the Future of the Site\n- We asked residents via this web site and via Facebook to provide their views on the future of the site, whether it should be retained as a BMX site and if so for what level of ability, or whether it should be used for some other purpose.\n- 61 people responded to our request for feedback with a clear majority of 42 people, 69%, saying they wanted us to retain a BMX course in Coombes Wood.\n- The majority of people wanting a BMX course said they were keen that we cater for a mix of abilities, beginners as well as more advanced riders and aimed at local residents.\n- 2 people said they thought we should focus on expert level riders only.\n- 4 people asked that the area be reverted to natural woodland.\n- Our thanks to those who took the time to respond, we will take these views into consideration as we now decide the best way forward.",

  "https_colehill_gov_uk_councillors_cllr-emma-urquhart_/https_colehill_gov_uk_neighbourhoodplan_what-is-a-neighbourhood-plan/content_72.html": "- Neighbourhood Plans were introduced by the Localism Act 2011 to set planning policies for a designated area.\n- To come into force the plan is independently examined and then subject to a local referendum.\n- It has the same legal force as the Dorset Council Local Plan, and planning applications must take it into account.\n- You can read more about Neighbourhood Plans on the Government’s Neighbourhood Planning website.\nWhat are the Benefits?\n- It gives our community a say over the type and design of new developments, and the appropriate infrastructure required to accommodate an increasing population.\n- It allows planning policies to be specified for a wide range of topics, e.g.:\n- sites designated for future housing, offices, shops etc,\n- design standards that must be followed for new housing,\n- environmental standards for new housing,\n- new greenspaces designated that will be protected from development,\n- sites designated for affordable housing,\n- sites designated for community-led development schemes, e.g. community land trust\n- transport needs for new developments, e.g. parking spaces, cycle paths & public transport links.\n- Once a plan is in place it must be taken into account in planning decisions, with the same legal status as the Local Plan.\n- Where a Neighbourhood Plan is in place, the parish receives a larger share of the Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) charged to developers of new developments, 25% rather than the normal 15%. This will allow us to invest in new or improved community facilities within Colehill.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nQ – Can a Neighbourhood Plan be used to stop development?\nA – No, Neighbourhood Plans must seek to meet the development needs of their area, and can’t change or conflict housing allocations specified in the Dorset Council Local Plan. They can however be used to set design or infrastructure requirements that the new housing must meet.\nQ – How long does a Neighbourhood Plan take to produce?\nA – Typically 2 to 3 years, to seek input from the community and develop proposed policies, which are then subject to an independent examination and a local referendum before the plan comes into force.\nQ – How long will the plan be in force?\nA – The duration can be determined by us, but typically Neighbourhood Plans are in force for 10 to 20 years.",

It is a great place to play football, have a picnic or walk the dog (please pick up any mess though).\nAt Oliver’s Park there is a play area which is ideal for children aged 12 years and under. It is a fenced area with adventurous play equipment surrounded by soft play bark. Children can climb, jump, swing and slide on all the equipment without too much supervision, however there is also a multi play unit and some cradle swings specifically for younger children. Park benches are provided so parents, grandparents and minders can sit and watch their children having fun.\nFor the truly adventurous Churchmoor Copse woodland is close to the play area. Great for a game of hide and seek.\nFires & BBQs\nThe lighting of fires or bbqs at woodlands and public spaces across Dorset is banned, including at Oliver’s Park, Churchmoor Copse, Cannonhill Plantation & ByTheWay field. The police can now issue on-the-spot fines of £100. Please help to keep our woodlands safe and report any fire or bbq to the emergency services.\nCovid-19 Guidance\nIn line with the government’s guidance for ‘Safer public places – managing public outdoor settings’, issued July 2021:-\n- You should not use the playground if you have Covid symptoms.\n- Limit any close contact with people you do not normally live with.\n- Wash your hands and/or sanitise after using the playground.\nQueens Green Canopy 2022\nOn 20th January 2022 we planted 7 ornamental trees in Oliver’s Park field in conjunction with the HM The Queen’s Green Canopy. Each tree represents a decade that HM The Queen has been on the throne and forms part of the Colehill Platinum Jubilee celebrations.\nThe trees planted are:\n- Bramley Apple\n- Prunus Serrulata Kiku Shidare Zakur (Cherry)\n- Liquidamber Styraciflua Worplesdon (Sweet Gum)\n- Cornus Controversa Varigata (Wedding Cake Tree)\n- Betula Nigra (Black Birch)\n- Sorbus Aucuparia (Rowan)\n- Tilia Cordata Greenspire (small leaved lime)\nOliver’s Park Improvements in 2021\nSince taking ownership of Oliver’s Park and the adjacent woodland area of Churchmoor Copse from Dorset Council in December 2020, we have embarked on a series of improvements:\n- The football pitch has been repaired, with holes filled, ground de-compacted and worn grass areas re-seeded.\n- The fences and gates around the children’s playground have been replaced, and the play area enlarged to allow more space for families inside.\n- We’ve cut back the brambles and nettles along all the main pathways within Churchmoor Copse.\n- We’ve held a volunteer workday, supported by Ultra Electronics, to cut back brambles and undergrowth behind the Scout/Guide hall, around the car park and by the entrance nearest Churchnoor Rd.\nAdditional Improvements in 2022\nIn January 2022 we installed a new pathway between Cutlers Place and Oliver’s Park field to alleviate the problems with the muddy track, making the field more accessible for everyone.\nDuring 2022 we hope to make many more implrovements to Oliver’s Park and Churchmoor Copse. Our current ideas include:\n- New signage boards at the main entrances.\n- A sensory garden area near the Scout / Guide hut.\n- Additional benches near the Scouts/Guides hut, including a new pathway to improve access from the car park.\nThese improvements are being overseen by our Oliver’s Park Working Group. Please let us know what you think, and let us have any additional ideas you have for improving the facilities using the feedback form on this site.",

  "https_colehill_gov_uk_councillors_cllr-emma-urquhart_/https_colehill_gov_uk_proposal-to-unite-furzehill/content_119.html": "Dorset Council are currently conducting a “Community Governance Review”, which among other things will look at whether any changes are required to parish boundaries and wards.\nColehill Parish Council have resolved to submit the following two suggestions for consideration:\n- To seek to unite the two parts of Furzehill, by adjusting the parish boundary that currently runs along Smugglers Lane and Grange. We believe that moving the whole of Furzehill into Colehill Parish will help improve community identity for Furzehill and make it easier for us to invest in additional facilities for Furzehill going forward.\n- To seek to combine the existing three Colehill parish wards into one. This will simplify our administration, particularly for parish councillor elections, and will have no other impact on our operation.\nYou can read full details of our CGR Response here.\nDorset Council are due to publish their draft recommendations on 20th Dec 21. They will then hold a public consultation which will be open until 28th Feb 22.",

  "https_colehill_gov_uk_councillors_cllr-emma-urquhart_/https_colehill_gov_uk_5g-planning-application-refused/content_50.html": "The planning application for a 5G mast on the verge opposite the Colehill co-op has been refused. The Planning Officer’s report states that “the siting and appearance of the proposed mast and associated cabinets would result in harm to the character and appearance of the application site which provides attractive public amenity space, and visual harm to the street scene”. They also advise that any future applications need to consult with nearby schools, which this application failed to do.\nIn total there were 101 public responses, only 2 of which supported the proposal. The report recognises that the proposed site provides “a focal point within the local community and an important amenity space for residents and visitors”. It states the mast “has not been designed to minimise the impact on amenity” and that “the proposal would introduce a stark urban feature to the space which would adversely impact on the street scene and character of the area”. It concludes that the proposed mast “would appear as visually stark and prominent feature in the street scene and urbanise this attractive area of open space, failing to harmonise with the site’s verdant and pleasant character”.",

Tony was born in Hayes Lane, Colehill and educated at the Queen Elizabeth’s Grammar School (as it then was) in Wimborne. He served in the Royal Air Force and then as an Officer Instructor with the Air Training Corps. He worked in the electrical industry, eventually setting up his own business.\nWe believe that he joined the Parish Council sometime in the mid 70s (we are not sure exactly when). He was Chairman of the Council between 1983 and 1985 and again from 1993 to 1995. He finally stood down at the elections of May 2019. As such a long-serving member, he had seen many changes and was a mine of information on the history of the village and the council.\nIn 1972, Tony was appointed Justice of the Peace, as which he served for 29 years – with no remission for good behaviour (as he joked).\nHis hobbies included photography, gardening, caravanning and model railways.\nUntil recent years Tony and his wife Freda opened their garden every year for the National Gardens Scheme – raising thousands of pounds for various charities. The highlight for many of the visitors was to see his model train running on its permanent track around the pond.\nTony is survived by his widow, two children, five grandchildren and seven great grandchildren.\nThe funeral service will be held at Bournemouth Crematorium at 11am on 6th October.\nColehill Parish Council, 14th September 2021",

  "https_colehill_gov_uk_councillors_cllr-emma-urquhart_/https_colehill_gov_uk_neighbourhoodplan/content_43.html": "Colehill Neighbourhood Plan\nLatest Position\n- It was agreed at Council on 8th November 2022 to stop all work on a Neighbourhood Plan for Colehill for the following reasons:\n- Many of the priority topics identified by residents in the Household Survey can be progressed without a Neighbourhood Plan, only a few of the topics would be aided by a Neighbourhood Plan being in place.\n- Our councillor numbers, coming out of Covid, are significantly depleted and we have a heavy workload of projects & improvement initiatives underway and in plan.\n- There are many uncertainties in the wider planning environment: Dorset Council have withdrawn their initial draft Local Plan, and extended their timescales until 2026; the Government have announced they intend making significant reforms to the planning system.\nBackground & Activities Undertaken in 2021\n- A Neighbourhood Plan allows our community to decide on the planning policies we want for our area. Once approved it will have legal force, and will sit alongside the Dorset Council Local Plan to direct future decisions on planning applications for our area. It will lay out a vision for how we want the Colehill area to develop over the next 10 to 20 years to meet our local needs, by setting policies on such things as house design, environmental standards that must be met, and associated infrastructure that will be supported.\n- See ‘What is a Neighbourhood Plan?’ for more information, including the likely benefits for Colehill and frequently asked questions.\n- Work officially started on 2nd June 2021 when Dorset Council agreed to designate our parish area, see the ‘Neighbourhood Area’ for a map showing the area covered by the Neighbourhood Plan, which is the civil parish of Colehill. As well the village of Colehill, this includes areas such as Furzehill, Canford Bottom, Stapehill Crescent, Hayes Lane, The Vineries, Beaucroft Road, Highland Road and Giddylake.\n- See the ‘Mini Surveys’ page for details of the initial surveys conducted to both households and businesses to identify the key priority areas the Neighbourhood Plan should focus on.\n- We received 621 responses to our Mini Household Survey in August 2021 to identify residents priorities, and this will be used to shape our activities over the next few years.\nParish Plan Produced in 2008\n- In June 2008 a Parish Plan for Colehill was developed with input and support from many local residents. Many of the recomendations were implemented in subsequent years. Although this document is now out of date, a link is retained here for future reference.",

Part of the solution was felt to be the many improvements now taking place, and other planned, to widen the appeal of this facility to the local community.\nA number of changes were considered and discussed, including a name change at a meeting of the Management Committee and representatives from the Hall User Groups (28th June 2021)\nThe challenges identified are now being addressed, including a reduction in fees for all user groups, and have already lead to a significant increase in bookings – particularly children’s groups and birthday parties.\nIn order to future-proof our Village Hall, a program of investment has started, and will continue over the next few years, including:\n- Main Hall redecoration – now completed\n- New curtains – to be installed during November 2021\n- New sign and noticeboard – before end of 2021\n- Other Planned Work\n- External landscaping (including patio area), outside seating space\n- New gates, local signage\n- Additional kitchen equipment, Toilet refurbishment,\nTo keep this valuable asset for our community, we need more people to help, by joining the Committee who are all volunteers.\nTo find out more, to volunteer, or make a booking query please contact us by email at : colehillvillagehall.bookings@gmail.com",

  "https_colehill_gov_uk_councillors_cllr-emma-urquhart_/https_colehill_gov_uk_tip-off-the-dorset-waste-partnership/content_286.html": "A new campaign has been launched asking Dorset residents for their help in the fight against fly-tipping.\nThe Dorset Waste Partnership’s (DWP) ‘Tip-Off’ campaign is aiming to inform the public about how they can report illegally dumped rubbish and prevent fly-tipping in the first place.\nLike most counties, Dorset is subject to persistent fly-tipping and the number of incidences is continuing to increase, following a national trend. On top of the obvious damage to the environment, the clearance of this waste costs the DWP around £150,000 per year.\nA series of roadshows are happening across the county where DWP officers are talking to local people about what they can do to help stop fly-tipping activity. The campaign will also be promoted in the local press, on radio and across social media.\nThe ‘Tip-Off’ campaign focusses on three key areas:-\n- Report it – Fly-tips can be reported to the DWP online and by phone. Where there is sufficient evidence, we will investigate all reported incidents and attempt to trace and prosecute anyone found to be fly-tipping.\n- Make sure you’re covered – Rubbish you’ve handed to someone else is still your legal responsibility until it is correctly disposed of. If someone – such as an unlicensed ‘man in a van’ found online – were to fly-tip that waste, you could end up paying a fine or being taken to court.\n- Love your HRC – Most fly-tips in Dorset consist of household waste that could have been taken to a household recycling centre (HRC, or ‘the tip’) and disposed of free of charge. There are 11 HRCs across Dorset, open daily, free to visit and do not charge for most items.\nFly-tipping is a criminal offence, punishable of fines of up to £50,000 or 12 months imprisonment if convicted in a Magistrate’s Court. The offence can attract an unlimited fine and up to 5 years imprisonment if convicted in a Crown Court.\nCouncillor Tony Alford, chairman of the Dorset Waste Partnership’s Joint Committee, said:\n“We have recently expanded our Enforcement Team and are investigating more fly-tipping incidents than ever before, but we need the help of Dorset residents to help us fight against this illegal activity. The ‘Tip-Off’ campaign will help inform others about what they can do.\nThe DWP need people to keep us informed when they spot fly-tips and people dumping rubbish. We want residents to check who they’re handing their waste to and to use their local household recycling centre whenever they can.\nThere are no excuses for fly-tipping. It’s unsightly and damaging to the environment. But we all have a part to play in stopping this anti-social behaviour and by working together I know we can make a positive impact.”\nDorset residents can find out more by visiting www.dorsetforyou.gov.uk/tip-off.\nFly-tipping incidents can be reported by visiting www.dorsetforyou.gov.uk/flytipping, e-mailing enquiries@dorsetwastepartnership.gov.uk or calling 01305 221040.",

It runs a fully featured library service on our doorstep, as well as providing a friendly, social and informative hub for residents.\nYou can browse the books, magazines, newspapers, large print books and other items in the library building itself. Members of the Dorset Library Service can borrow books with the added advantage that you can collect and return your borrowed items within walking distance of your home. The Dorset Library Service is part of a partnership of libraries in the south west of England which means you have access to any of the 145 public libraries across the consortium to borrow, return, renew and reserve items, and use the computers to access the internet. You get access to a joint catalogue of around 2.5 million items including books, DVDs, spoken word, music CDs, printed music, maps and language materials. Your membership card can also be used to access a range of e resources including e books and e audio books. Moreover, Colehill Community library has added a locally run jigsaw loan service. You can even request to get an email telling you when your reservation is ready for collection and a timely reminder when it is due for renewal. And it’s all free.\nIn addition, there are also a range of regular group activities. They include special interest groups – Colehill Reading group, and a Family History group which benefits from the library’s free access to the Ancestry website. For the youngest members there is TODDLER TIME Stories and Rhymes. And there are the ever popular and bookable IT One to One Sessions. There is no charge but donations to the Library are always welcome.\nFor more details pop in, follow the Library pages above, see our Newsletter on the News page or visit our Facebook page.\nHistory\nThere have been libraries in Colehill for nearly 100 years. The first was opened in the Parish Hall in 1913 and founded by Henrietta Vaughan Williams (niece to the composer), then organist at St. Michael’s Church.\nThe present Colehill Library building opened as a branch library of the Dorset County Council Library Service in February 1974. It began with a selection of 5000 books, including selections for children and large-print volumes for the partially sighted.\nWhen threatened with closure, The Friends of Colehill Library worked with Dorset Council, Colehill Parish Council and others to keep the library open. Through the hard work and determination and a lot of volunteer effort the library opened as COLEHILL COMMUNITY LIBRARY on 8th January 2013. On 4th April 2014 the ‘Friends’ (FoCoL) merged with Colehill Community Library Ltd.; the ‘Friends’ activities with fundraising continue, and supporters can now join Colehill Community Library Ltd. as company members. The Library is a limited company with charity status.\nOn 7th June 2016 the Dorset Library Service joined the ‘LibrariesWest’ group giving our library access to resources across the South West of England.\nData Protection\nFrom May 2018 the new Data Protection Act (GDPR) will come into force.

It is a great place to play football, have a picnic or walk the dog (please pick up any mess though).\nAt Oliver’s Park there is a play area which is ideal for children aged 12 years and under. It is a fenced area with adventurous play equipment surrounded by soft play bark. Children can climb, jump, swing and slide on all the equipment without too much supervision, however there is also a multi play unit and some cradle swings specifically for younger children. Park benches are provided so parents, grandparents and minders can sit and watch their children having fun.\nFor the truly adventurous Churchmoor Copse woodland is close to the play area. Great for a game of hide and seek.\nFires & BBQs\nThe lighting of fires or bbqs at woodlands and public spaces across Dorset is banned, including at Oliver’s Park, Churchmoor Copse, Cannonhill Plantation & ByTheWay field. The police can now issue on-the-spot fines of £100. Please help to keep our woodlands safe and report any fire or bbq to the emergency services.\nCovid-19 Guidance\nIn line with the government’s guidance for ‘Safer public places – managing public outdoor settings’, issued July 2021:-\n- You should not use the playground if you have Covid symptoms.\n- Limit any close contact with people you do not normally live with.\n- Wash your hands and/or sanitise after using the playground.\nQueens Green Canopy 2022\nOn 20th January 2022 we planted 7 ornamental trees in Oliver’s Park field in conjunction with the HM The Queen’s Green Canopy. Each tree represents a decade that HM The Queen has been on the throne and forms part of the Colehill Platinum Jubilee celebrations.\nThe trees planted are:\n- Bramley Apple\n- Prunus Serrulata Kiku Shidare Zakur (Cherry)\n- Liquidamber Styraciflua Worplesdon (Sweet Gum)\n- Cornus Controversa Varigata (Wedding Cake Tree)\n- Betula Nigra (Black Birch)\n- Sorbus Aucuparia (Rowan)\n- Tilia Cordata Greenspire (small leaved lime)\nOliver’s Park Improvements in 2021\nSince taking ownership of Oliver’s Park and the adjacent woodland area of Churchmoor Copse from Dorset Council in December 2020, we have embarked on a series of improvements:\n- The football pitch has been repaired, with holes filled, ground de-compacted and worn grass areas re-seeded.\n- The fences and gates around the children’s playground have been replaced, and the play area enlarged to allow more space for families inside.\n- We’ve cut back the brambles and nettles along all the main pathways within Churchmoor Copse.\n- We’ve held a volunteer workday, supported by Ultra Electronics, to cut back brambles and undergrowth behind the Scout/Guide hall, around the car park and by the entrance nearest Churchnoor Rd.\nAdditional Improvements in 2022\nIn January 2022 we installed a new pathway between Cutlers Place and Oliver’s Park field to alleviate the problems with the muddy track, making the field more accessible for everyone.\nDuring 2022 we hope to make many more implrovements to Oliver’s Park and Churchmoor Copse. Our current ideas include:\n- New signage boards at the main entrances.\n- A sensory garden area near the Scout / Guide hut.\n- Additional benches near the Scouts/Guides hut, including a new pathway to improve access from the car park.\nThese improvements are being overseen by our Oliver’s Park Working Group. Please let us know what you think, and let us have any additional ideas you have for improving the facilities using the feedback form on this site.",

  "https_colehill_gov_uk_councillors_cllr-emma-urquhart_/https_colehill_gov_uk_5g-mast-prior-approval-application/content_85.html": "The telecoms company Three have now submitted a planning application to seek ‘prior approval’ for a 18 metre tall 5G mast and 4 associated cabinets, to be erected on the corner opposite the co-op shop, at the junction of Smugglers Lane and Wimborne Road.\nThe ‘prior approval’ process being followed means that the principle of erecting a 5G mast can’t be challenged. The application is to determine whether Dorset Council’s prior approval is required for the siting and appearance of the mast.\nWhat is 5G?\n- 5G is a new type of mobile internet connection, approximately 10 times faster than the existing 4G mobile network and allowing far more devices to access the internet at the same time.\n- If you use the Three network, then you may benefit from the new mast if you access the internet with a 5G compatible smartphone or other mobile device.\n- It will not improve your home broadband service unless you switch to Three and purchase a new 5G broadband router.\nWhat Will it Look Like?\nWe attach an impression showing how we think the mast and supporting cabinets will appear based on the information sent to us by the telecoms company. There will be 4 supporting cabinets, running for 6m (20 feet) alongside the public footpath in front of the bench and parish map. The tallest cabinet will be 1.75m (5 feet 9 inches) tall.\nThe mast will be galvanised, appearing initially as shiny light grey and weathering to a matt grey. The cabinets will be painted grey.\nColehill Parish Council’s View\n373 residents responded to a survey we conducted in April to understand your views. The vast majority of people responding said they supported the principle of 5G masts in Colehill, but not at the proposed location.\nColehill Parish Council have therefore agreed and submitted the following Colehill Parish Council Objection to 5G Mast.\nPlease Provide Your Feedback to Dorset Council\nWe encourage all Colehill residents to provide their own feedback.\nResponses should be submitted by 7th June on the Dorset Council Planning Application Site (just select this link, accept the terms and conditions and then click the button that says ‘make comments on this application’).\nRemember you can’t object to the principle of a 5G mast being installed, this application is seeking views on the siting and appearance of the mast.",

Local (town and parish) councils are led by democratically elected councillors from the local community. Local Councillors decide on what services and projects the Council will deliver. As representatives of the first tier of local government and the closest to their communities, local Councillors are best placed to engage with their residents and find out what the real local issues are and how to overcome them. To find out more about local councils, take a look at All about Local Councils. For some examples of what local Councils do, take a look at Points of Light 2019\nWHAT ELSE DO YOU NEED TO KNOW?\nMost people are qualified to stand for their local council but there are a few rules. You have to be:\n- A British citizen, or a citizen of the Commonwealth, or the European Union\n- 18 years of age or older\n- registered as a local government elector for the parish; or\n- has during the whole of the twelve months preceding the date of co-option, occupied as owner or tenant, any land or other premises in the parish; or\n- his/her principal or only place of work during those twelve months has been in the parish; or\n- has during the whole of twelve months resided in the parish or within 3 miles of it.\nYou cannot stand for election if you:\n- Are the subject of a bankruptcy restriction order or interim order\n- Have within five years before the day of the election, been convicted in the United Kingdom of any offence and have had a prison sentence (whether suspended or not) for a period of over three months without the option of a fine\n- Work for the council you want to become a councillor for.\n- NEW LEGISLATION – LOCAL GOVERNMENT DISQUALIIFCATION ACT 2022 | This act disqualifies individuals subject to certain sexual offence legal orders from standing for election or holding office in local authorities.\nIf you would like to be considered for co-option, take a look at our Colehill Co-option Policy and submit your Application Form, together with a covering letter setting out what you could bring to the role and the parish of Colehill to the parish Clerk, Zoe Caddy at 17 Four Wells Road Colehill Dorset BH21 7BA, or e-mail it to clerk@colehill.gov.uk.",

It runs a fully featured library service on our doorstep, as well as providing a friendly, social and informative hub for residents.\nYou can browse the books, magazines, newspapers, large print books and other items in the library building itself. Members of the Dorset Library Service can borrow books with the added advantage that you can collect and return your borrowed items within walking distance of your home. The Dorset Library Service is part of a partnership of libraries in the south west of England which means you have access to any of the 145 public libraries across the consortium to borrow, return, renew and reserve items, and use the computers to access the internet. You get access to a joint catalogue of around 2.5 million items including books, DVDs, spoken word, music CDs, printed music, maps and language materials. Your membership card can also be used to access a range of e resources including e books and e audio books. Moreover, Colehill Community library has added a locally run jigsaw loan service. You can even request to get an email telling you when your reservation is ready for collection and a timely reminder when it is due for renewal. And it’s all free.\nIn addition, there are also a range of regular group activities. They include special interest groups – Colehill Reading group, and a Family History group which benefits from the library’s free access to the Ancestry website. For the youngest members there is TODDLER TIME Stories and Rhymes. And there are the ever popular and bookable IT One to One Sessions. There is no charge but donations to the Library are always welcome.\nFor more details pop in, follow the Library pages above, see our Newsletter on the News page or visit our Facebook page.\nHistory\nThere have been libraries in Colehill for nearly 100 years. The first was opened in the Parish Hall in 1913 and founded by Henrietta Vaughan Williams (niece to the composer), then organist at St. Michael’s Church.\nThe present Colehill Library building opened as a branch library of the Dorset County Council Library Service in February 1974. It began with a selection of 5000 books, including selections for children and large-print volumes for the partially sighted.\nWhen threatened with closure, The Friends of Colehill Library worked with Dorset Council, Colehill Parish Council and others to keep the library open. Through the hard work and determination and a lot of volunteer effort the library opened as COLEHILL COMMUNITY LIBRARY on 8th January 2013. On 4th April 2014 the ‘Friends’ (FoCoL) merged with Colehill Community Library Ltd.; the ‘Friends’ activities with fundraising continue, and supporters can now join Colehill Community Library Ltd. as company members. The Library is a limited company with charity status.\nOn 7th June 2016 the Dorset Library Service joined the ‘LibrariesWest’ group giving our library access to resources across the South West of England.\nData Protection\nFrom May 2018 the new Data Protection Act (GDPR) will come into force. This will bring in new regulations on how organisations can contact their supporters. These changes are to protect you from unwanted contact.\nWe look after any personal information you share with us.\nWe may collect information from you when you enquire about becoming a Colehill Community Library supporter, a member of Colehill Community Library Ltd (this is not the same as joining Dorset Library Service [Libraries South West]) or a volunteer or purchasing tickets for a library event.\nAs a supporter you will receive notice of the release date of our bi-monthly Newsletter, and a reminder when your renewal is due.\nAs a member of the Company you will also receive an invitation to the AGM.\nAs a volunteer you will also receive emails from the co-ordinator about your library duties.\nWe do not share personal information with anyone at any time without your express permission.\nThe only exceptions to this are:-\n- our legal obligation to share your name, house number, postcode, date and amount of your subscription/donation with HMRC if you are in the gift aid scheme.\n- our legal obligation to share your name and address with our accountants if you are a member of Colehill Community Library Ltd.\nIf you would like to be reminded about what information you have shared with the Library, email us, entering DATA PROTECTION ENQUIRY in the subject box.

However many species are under threat due to human consumption, pollution, climate change and population growth.\nWhat can parish councils do to help biodiversity?\nParish councils, like all public authorities in the UK, have a legal duty to consider conservation of biodiversity when carrying out their functions. This includes:\n- Ensuring public access to high quality open spaces including the ability to designate land as Local Green Space.\n- Protecting green belt land and safeguarding the countryside from encroachment.\n- Maintaining green corridors, to prevent neighbouring areas from merging.\n- Conserving and enhancing the natural environment through the protection of valued landscapes.\nHow can you help us improve biodiversity in Colehill?\nColehill has a wide range of biodiverse habitats, including trees, hedges, grassland, woodland and wetlands which gives it a very special appeal. We know many residents are concerned about the potential impact from future housing developments on these habitats.\nWe look forward to hearing your ideas for how biodiversity in Colehill can be safeguarded and improved. This could include for example, improvements to existing wildlife sites, creating new sites, providing additional habitats (such as bird & bat boxes), improving wildlife corridors between sites, or seeking to protect specific areas from development.\nPlease let us know what your think using our online Feedback Form.",

  "https_colehill_gov_uk_councillors_cllr-emma-urquhart_/https_colehill_gov_uk_roadsafety/content_38.html": "We know that road safety is important to our residents, both as pedestrians and road users. We act as a voice for the community, reporting issues to the highway authority and suggesting improvements.\nSpeed Indicator Device\nWe own and maintain a Speed Indicator Device (SID) which is moved regularly between three locations: Middlehill Road, Leigh Road and Wimborne Road. The SID captures data on the speed of vehicles which is shared with the police to inform their speed camera operations. We know from evidence provided from Dorset Council that the SID is effective at reducing traffic speed. This year we updated the solar panel installed at the Leigh Road site.\nPedestrian Crossings\nWe continue to liaise with Dorset Council to seek the installation of pedestrian crossing points at two locations on Middlehill Road, near Lonnen Road and near Cutlers Place. These locations were chosen following a public consultation in 2022, and have been assessed by Dorset Council as feasible sites based on road and pedestrian numbers.\nLatest Update Issued 29th April 2025\nDorset Council have confirmed this week that work is now underway looking at the potential installation of pedestrian crossings at two locations on Middlehill Road, one near the junction with Cutlers Place and the other near the junction with Lonnen Road. This follows our public survey in 2022 asking our residents if they supported the introduction of pedestrian crossing points, 92% of those responding confirming they did.\nDorset Council have undertaken traffic surveys at these two locations and confirmed they meet the necessary criteria for a crossing. We have now been informed that work is actively underway and an engineer has been allocated to look at the technical options and costs involved.\nThis is the latest update we’ve received from Dorset Council…\n“We understand the importance of ensuring the safety of all residents, especially children, the elderly, and vulnerable individuals, particularly given the tragic recent event.\nIt is good to hear of the clear support for the crossings. Please be assured that work is underway and we expect options and costs in due course. Unfortunately, we receive a significantly higher number of requests for pedestrian crossings each year than our available budget allows us to construct. This means that it can take several years between a request for a crossing and construction, and schemes are delivered in priority order. When we have the costs and options back from the engineer, we will have a better idea of when we will be able to build the scheme.\nWe are currently in the early stages of the scheme. Therefore, we cannot yet provide exact details of the crossing options and associated costs for residents, as we are awaiting this information from the allocated engineer who is now working on the project.

  "https_colehill_gov_uk_councillors_cllr-emma-urquhart_/https_colehill_gov_uk_do-charges-at-the-dump-cause-fly-tipping/content_303.html": "Think that charges at the dump cause fly-tipping? It might be time to think again.\nAs part of their current ‘Tip-Off’ anti-flytipping campaign, the Dorset Waste Partnership (DWP) is directly addressing some of the comments they hear from residents in the fight against the illegal dumping of waste.\nThe most consistent complaint received is that Household Recycling Centre (HRC) charges have directly led to an increase in fly-tipping. Yet, there is no statistical data to support this belief.\n“The Enforcement Team is out every day around Dorset, investigating fly-tips and trying to catch the criminals responsible.\nMost of the waste we find is regular ‘black bag’ rubbish; the type that can be disposed of at an HRC free of charge. Those dumped items that are charged for generally appear to have been fly-tipped by rogue traders or illegal waste carriers, such as an unlicenced ‘man in a van.’\nHRCs have always been for the disposal of typical household waste; Commercial waste has never been accepted for free at any of our sites. If a tradesman produces or carries waste as part of their everyday activities, that person has always needed to budget its disposal into their business costs.”\nThe idea that the removal of HRC charges would lead to a halt in fly-tipping is a bemusing one to Jeremy. Fly-tipping was on the rise before the charges were introduced back in September 2016 and, while the trend has sadly continued, there has been no related spike in incidents since.\nThere are dozens of facilities across the county that accept commercial waste. Those who choose to fly-tip are simply looking to save themselves money. Understandable, but illegal nonetheless.\nEven if we could open our HRCs to dispose of commercial waste for free, Dorset residents would still bear the financial cost of processing the waste through treatment or landfill tax. Why should tax-payers subsidise the profits of private businesses?”\nJeremy sometimes hears that local authorities have made access to HRCs too difficult for some.\n“Our eleven HRCs are open and free to visit 362 days a year. Most vehicles – including vans, trailers and commercially registered vehicles – can enter our sites. Those that do need a permit can apply for one online free of charge and approval is usually immediate.”\nHowever, Jeremy and the DWP’s Enforcement Team remain determined to get to grips with the problem: –\n“We all have a responsibility to prevent fly-tipping and the only way we can effectively fight this behaviour is for local authorities and the public to work together.\nThe DWP has a responsibility to investigate, pursue and penalise fly-tippers, as well as clear up the mess they leave behind. We’re working closely with Dorset Police and are taking more action than ever before. Concerned residents should report fly-tips to us, check they are handing their waste to a reputable business or individual and use their HRC whenever they can.\nWe share the public’s frustration with fly-tipping; it’s a blight on our beautiful county. But we’re taking this problem very seriously and will continue to work toward eradicating this illegal activity.”",

Please see the complete set of documents above.\nOUR PRECEPT 2025/2026\nThe Precept is the figure which a town or parish Council ask the local authority to collect from their residents alongside the Council tax.\nFor the financial year 2025/26 we have slightly increased the precept on a band D dwelling which still falls at under £1 per week.\nOur total precept collected will be £138,500 which represents the largest income stream of our overall estimated income of £189,262.87. Our expected expenditure is £217,675.43 which means a shortfall of £28,412.56 will be funded from our savings or ‘reserves’.\nMuch of Colehill Parish Council‘s expenditure is fixed year on year and cannot be cut back on, and the new assets and staff the Council have taken on since 2020 play a large part in how this figure was resolved. These new assets are:\n- Oliver’s Park field and the ancient woodland at Churchmoor Copse which have been underfunded for many years and pose a potential large spend albeit one which the residents of Colehill would hopefully welcome.\n- Colehill & Wimborne Youth & Community Centre on 1st April 2023. Whilst this charity is ideally self-sufficient, the Council should seek to have finances in place whilst the charity transitions to a new model of paid staff members running the administration and daily operations of the centre, should the charity need any financial support.\nIncreasing the precept was necessary following the previous years very small or no increase decisions. Colehill Parish Council are confident in their ability to deliver new projects and maintaining services.\nColehill Parish Council are always open to discussing the finances with interested or concerned residents and would always welcome feedback.

A new disabled ramp hugely helps to attendance of the public to Council meetings in this room rather than needing a different space is we knew someone with reduced mobility wanted to attend a meeting.\nThe Committee Room is available to hire by smaller groups and/or clubs – enquiries can be made on colehillvillagehall.bookings@gmail.com\nThe Council is pleased to be in a position to provide a large grant to enable to Hall Committee to carry out this project will enhance the Hall greatly.",
  "https_colehill_gov_uk_councillors_cllr-emma-urquhart_/https_colehill_gov_uk_lcas/content_27.html": "Colehill Parish Council has been awarded a Foundation Level Award under the Local Council Award Scheme.\nThis prestigious award recognises that the Council achieves good practice in governance, community engagement and council improvement. It evidences that we go above and beyond our legal obligations, leading our community and continuously seeking opportunities to improve and develop even further.\nThe Award Scheme report highlights that our particular areas of strength include: engagement with the local community; advertising council activities; and making it easy for residents to contact us.\nThe Foundation Level Award was granted in December 2021 and lasts for four years.\nHow Does the Award Scheme Work?\nAll local councils want to serve their local communities and make a real difference to the lives of the people that live there. This scheme offers councils the opportunity to show that they meet the standards set by the sector, assessed by their peers, and to put in place the conditions for continued improvement.\nThe Local Council Award Scheme has been designed to both provide the tools and encouragement to those councils at the beginning of their improvement journeys, as well as promoting and recognising councils that are at the cutting edge of the sector. It is only through the sector working together to share best practice, drive up standards and supporting those who are committed to improving their offer to their communities that individual councils and the sector as a whole will reach its full potential.\nThe scheme was created in 2014 and is managed on behalf of local councils by the Improvement and Development Board (IDB).\nCouncils can apply for an award at one of three levels:\n- The Foundation Award demonstrates that a council meets the requirements for operating lawfully and according to standard practice.\n- The Quality Award demonstrates that a council achieves good practice in governance, community engagement and council improvement.\n- The Quality Gold Award demonstrates that a council is at the forefront of best practice and achieves excellence in governance, community leadership and council development.\nThe scheme sets out criteria to meet at each level covering selected aspects of the council’s work. Councils can seek to progress through the tiers over time thereby raising standards. Councils of any size can aspire to an award appropriate for their budget and level of activity.\nTo support transparency, every award level has a requirement for certain information to be published online (plus some information that does not need to be published).

This is the culmination of a project begun in June 2017 after the previous map display board “The Colehill Millennium Map” had been vandalised. While the Millennium Map had been designed to record the village as it existed at the end of the 20th century, it was recognised that people – residents as well as visitors – would often consult the map for directions and understanding of the village layout and its facilities. The new map is designed to provide current, useful information and to be updated – in time – as things change.\nThe map itself is directly printed (@1260 x 900mm) onto the reverse of a perspex sheet, so as to avoid any issues with condensation, dirt, mould, vegetation or insects which might otherwise encroach between separate layers. Although the shape and composition of the village may change over the next 100 years it should be a relatively straightforward process to be able to update and reprint the map.\nThe design is by Richard Broadway and is based on a satellite image, which was then then extensively customised, over several weeks, with the addition of street names, footpaths, boundaries, parks and places of interest. The illustrations are by Rosemary McDonald and the construction and erection of the oak frame and canopy is by Colehill craftsman Nigel Harris. Over £700 of part air-dried and fully air-dried English Oak (provided by a local sawmill from responsibly managed resources) is used in the structure, while the roof boards are of Western Red Cedar. Nigel suggests that, properly maintained, the oak should last 100 years, although the roof boards will need replacing after 30 or 40 years.\nThe Parish Council have erected a copy of the map in the committee room at Colehill Memorial Hall for reference during council meetings and residents are already asking about copies for their own walls. Consideration is also being given to making copies of Rosemary’s lovely illustrations available to raise money for charity.",

The future positioning of this activity will be reviewed once the immediate threat has passed and normal meetings have resumed.\nThe environmental improvement ideas and actions agreed so far are as follows:\nThings Colehill Parish Council are doing:\n- We will consider the environmental impact in all future decisions and actions taken by Colehill Parish Council.\n- We will minimise our use of single-use plastics, including stopping the purchase of plastic bottles of water, Councillors will drink tap water and/or bring their own drinks to meetings in re-useable containers.\n- All local organisations receiving Grant Aid payments will be asked to complete an Environmental Questionnaire to help us shape our policies\n- Colehill Parish Council are offering free trees for residents. 630 trees were given out in December 2020, a further 525 distributed in October 2021 and 420 in both November 2022 and November 2023. This project is very well received by residents and we hope to continue this going forward whilst the demand is there.\nThings individuals in Colehill can do:\n- Recycle as much of your waste as possible:\n- Check what items will be collected in your fortnightly household recycling bins.\n- See what items can be taken to the Wimborne Recycling Centre (Tip)\n- Most types of plastic bags and soft plastic wrapping can now be recycled at the Colehill Co-op or Tesco in Ferndown.\n- If you’re not sure how to recycle any item, check the Recycle Now pages.\n- Switch to LED light bulbs, they use a lot less electricity and last a lot longer, so they save you money as well as helping the environment.\n- Switch to a Green Renewable Energy Supplier, to reduce your carbon footprint, use bigcleanswitch.org to obtain quotes from green energy suppliers.\n- Contact Healthy Homes Dorset for free impartial energy advice via an advice line open Monday-Friday, 9am-6pm, on 0300 003 7023. They can also provide free loft and cavity wall insulation to people that qualify.\n- Contact Renewable Heat Incentive for information on renewable heat technologies.

The cost of this is £90 including collection and recycling and it holds 7000 used blister packs. The company is called Reworked and we have investigated their credentials on actually recycling these items rather than just selling them onwards. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdZWLBy4rus\nWe hope we can offer this service to fill the gap that has been left by other local recycling points stopping but this will of course have to be reviewed if it is swamped by people coming from miles around due to the lack of this service elsewhere. Please be mindful to only put blister packs into the box and also that the Reef may be locked at lunchtimes sometimes.\nThis is very much a trial project for us – we have listened to our residents and hope this is helpful to you!\nThe blister pack collection has been very popular and is now almost full.

  "https_colehill_gov_uk_councillors_cllr-emma-urquhart_/https_colehill_gov_uk_proposed-parish-boundary-change/content_139.html": "Dorset Council are currently conducting a Community Governance Review (CGR) which, among other things, is looking at whether any changes are required to parish boundaries.\nThey have issued a draft proposal to transfer the area shaded in red on the map below from Colehill parish to Holt parish. This covers all land north of Burt’s Hill, including Furzehill, Grange, Dog Dean, Deans Grove and the Horns Inn.\nYou can read full details on page 22 of their draft recommendations. If you’d like to provide feedback directly to Dorset Council on this proposal, you can do so via the CGR page on their website until midnight on 23rd May.\nOur thanks to residents who have provided comments directly to us, to help us determine our own position. You can read the comments submitted here. These have been used to help us formulate our response to Dorset Council. at the Extraordinary Council meeting which was held on 20th May at 7:15pm.\nOur Response to Dorset Council\nWe agree it would be preferable for the two parts of Furzehill to be united in one parish, to improve community identity. However we oppose the recommendation as worded, as the area proposed to be moved to Holt would come very close to the heart of Colehill, and include one of just two pubs currently within the parish.\nWe submit instead an alternative proposal, which still achieves the aim of uniting Furzehill but draws the boundary in a more sensible position.\nAlternative Proposal:\nWe suggest an alternative proposal, very similar to the recommendation but moving the boundary to Dog Dean rather Long Lane.\n-\n-\n- This will still allow the two parts of Furzehill to be united in a single parish, and the change will only impact on c. 13 residential addresses which are closer to the centre of Colehill than Furzehill.\n- It would allow the Horns Inn to remain within Colehill. This is one of only two pubs currently within the parish, and our most central, being just 600m from our middle school, our church our war memorial.\n- It would allow Dumpton School to remain within the parish, a school with which Colehill Parish Council has had a close relationship over many years. Dumpton School are actively engaged in the community, and supported the parish council during the pandemic.\n- It retains Colehill’s green corridor to the north, and maintains the urban/rural balance for the parish.\nThe attached map shows shaded in pink the area Dorset Council have proposed be transferred to Holt, the red line showing our alternative boundary we propose on Dog Dean.\n-",

The posts are being installed beyond the edge of the road into the woodland in order to protect the woodland from vehicle parking which has been encroaching further and further onto the common – dragging mud onto the road and eroding the amenity land which Colehill Parish Council owns and maintains for the benefit of our residents.\nThese bollards are of a very naturalistic appearance (they look like wood), but they won’t decay and should last for many years.",
  "https_colehill_gov_uk_councillors_cllr-emma-urquhart_/https_colehill_gov_uk_colehill-neighbourhood-plan_what-is-a-neighbourhood-plan/content_76.html": "- Neighbourhood Plans were introduced by the Localism Act 2011 to set planning policies for a designated area.\n- To come into force the plan is independently examined and then subject to a local referendum.\n- It has the same legal force as the Dorset Council Local Plan, and planning applications must take it into account.\n- You can read more about Neighbourhood Plans on the Government’s Neighbourhood Planning website.\nWhat are the Benefits?\n- It gives our community a say over the type and design of new developments, and the appropriate infrastructure required to accommodate an increasing population.\n- It allows planning policies to be specified for a wide range of topics, e.g.:\n- sites designated for future housing, offices, shops etc,\n- design standards that must be followed for new housing,\n- environmental standards for new housing,\n- new greenspaces designated that will be protected from development,\n- sites designated for affordable housing,\n- sites designated for community-led development schemes, e.g. community land trust\n- transport needs for new developments, e.g. parking spaces, cycle paths & public transport links.\n- Once a plan is in place it must be taken into account in planning decisions, with the same legal status as the Local Plan.\n- Where a Neighbourhood Plan is in place, the parish receives a larger share of the Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) charged to developers of new developments, 25% rather than the normal 15%. This will allow us to invest in new or improved community facilities within Colehill.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nQ – Can a Neighbourhood Plan be used to stop development?\nA – No, Neighbourhood Plans must seek to meet the development needs of their area, and can’t change or conflict housing allocations specified in the Dorset Council Local Plan. They can however be used to set design or infrastructure requirements that the new housing must meet.\nQ – How long does a Neighbourhood Plan take to produce?\nA – Typically 2 to 3 years, to seek input from the community and develop proposed policies, which are then subject to an independent examination and a local referendum before the plan comes into force.\nQ – How long will the plan be in force?\nA – The duration can be determined by us, but typically Neighbourhood Plans are in force for 10 to 20 years.",
