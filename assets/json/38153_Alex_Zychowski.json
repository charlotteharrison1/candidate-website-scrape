  "https_libertarianpartyuk_com_/https_libertarianpartyuk_com_new-year-new-hopes/content_11.html": "Happy new year fellow libertarians! As we now find ourselves in the ‘Monday’ of months, it’s important to keep our spirits up. Granted, it’s difficult to do given the current political and economic climate. Starmer’s new year’s message was particularly nauseating. When I heard, “until you can look forward and believe in the promise and the prosperity of Britain again, then this government will fight for you,” I couldn’t help but think of “the beatings will continue until morale improves”. Needless to say, the Labour government has proven to be an utter failure in just six months. But, as Joseph de Maistre said, “Every country has the government it deserves”. It is on the British public to be better then perhaps. Change is always bottom up, not top down. So let us take this opportunity to set out five political new year’s resolutions for Britain and her electorate.\nStop Tolerating Dishonesty\nWe’ve had our fair share of dishonest prime ministers. The covid era and Johnson’s infamous cake ambush come sharply to mind. But few Prime Ministers have been so blatantly dishonest as Keir Starmer. He lied to his own party, promising to abolish tuition fees and then almost immediately reversed his stance upon taking over as party leader. He promised not to raise taxes on working people, only to do exactly that at the first opportunity once in power. Even the IFS have called Reeves’ claim that a £22bn black hole was covered up by the previous government a lie. Lying seems particularly chronic in the current regime. And why wouldn’t it be? It wins elections and currently has virtually no costs. In a just world, being caught lying to the public would be an instantly career ending event for any politician. If we ever want the status quo to change, it has to start from the bottom up. Any politician that has lied should be instantly unelectable. Any party that tolerates liars should face electoral oblivion. That is the only way we will see any semblance of honesty in politics.\nTreat Taxation as Theft\nThe difference between sex and rape is consent. The difference between work and slavery is consent. The difference between tax and theft is… well you see the problem. There’s a good chance that I’m preaching to the choir here, but it really does seem incredible how tolerant the general population is to tax increases from a political system that takes far more than it gives. Tax is theft and theft is evil, but it is sometimes the lesser of two evils. Libertarians understand this. But far from making us tolerant of taxation, this belief forces us to resist unnecessary levels of tax we see today. The analogy that comes to my mind is of fire. A little is vital to sustain society, but any more than strictly necessary is always disastrous. I believe that most people actually agree when it comes to their own money. The issue arises when politicians impose tax hikes on specific groups knowing that the rest of the population will do little to resist. Of course, they will get around to you sooner or later in Niemölleran fashion. Everyone should be protesting the tax hikes on farmers for instance, and in return, farmers should refrain from calling for import tariffs. In the end, the only winner is the state, unless we learn to treat tax for what it is.\nPractice Individual Responsibility\n“Ask not what your country can do for you-” I like to end the famous JFK quote there. After all, service to your country should be entirely voluntary. It is the widely held belief that the government is responsible for maintaining every aspect of our lives that we have ponzi schemes masquerading as state pensions and countless laws criminalising victimless crimes such as cannabis use. Of course not everyone is capable of practicing individual responsibility. Children, the elderly and the mentally and physically disabled may need help and in some cases require restrictions for their own good if they are not of sound mind or maturity. But for everyone else, responsibility for oneself should be the default position. That means enduring the costs of one’s own mistakes but reaping the benefits of success. After all, the lack of this kind of accountability directly led to the financial crash in 2008, with banks enjoying the benefits of risky behaviour in full knowledge that governments would never let them fail. It’s difficult not to imagine that similar perverse incentives motivate crime and dubious increases in the long term ‘sick’ since covid. But far from being a battlecry for the selfish and greedy, individual responsibility means taking positive action yourself to help others and fix problems. Instead of calling for the state to do more for whatever cause interests you, and taking their share along the way, cut out the middleman and make a change yourself. Donate to a dog shelter, volunteer at a food bank, pick up litter as you walk by. The more you leave to the government, the bigger it gets and the less gets done.\nLive and Let Live\nAs well as accepting individual responsibility, the flip side of that coin is the allowance of others to make decisions for themselves. For most people, political decisions seem to come down to banning things they find unpleasant whilst seeking public funding for those things that they enjoy. A common misconception is that the support for the freedom to do a thing equates to support for the thing itself. Smoking for instance is extremely harmful and on a personal level, I would implore anyone reading this to quit if they can. But I wholeheartedly oppose the upcoming ageist smoking ban. The only guiding principle for banning certain behaviours should be the prevention of harm to others. It may be difficult sometimes, but we will all be much freer if we learn to live and let live.\nVote Libertarian\nIf I may be so bold, I would like to suggest voting for the Libertarian Party UK if possible in the next year and beyond. We are the only party committed to the principles of Libertarianism. But we can’t make a change without your support. There is no such thing as a wasted vote. Very few votes ever manage to tip the scales in an election, but every vote sends a signal. So don’t compromise, vote for who you want to represent you. If you get the chance, vote libertarian in your next by-election, local elections etc. If we don’t have a candidate in your area, it could be you making the breakthrough into public service wearing a lion on your chest. Consider joining if you aren’t a member already and if you fancy writing articles like this, we’re always looking for new voices.\nOnce again, on behalf of the Libertarian Party UK and myself, have a happy new year.\nBen Ducker – Wessex Coordinator.",
  "https_libertarianpartyuk_com_/https_libertarianpartyuk_com_congratulations-canada/content_28.html": "Yesterday bore the welcome news of Justin Trudeau’s resignation as leader of the “Liberal” Party of Canada, and the calling of an election for 24th March. As the longest-serving leader in the G7, Canadians have suffered under his corrupt authoritarian regime since 2015.\nSince his time in office Trudeau has presided over open-door immigration, a spiralling cost of living and an acute housing crisis. (Sound familiar?) Attempting to award a $900 million contract to a charity linked to his family, pressurising the Attorney General to drop a corruption investigation and holidaying on the private island of a philantrhopist in receipt of Canadian taxpayers’ money can be listed amongst his many other achievements.\nWhile a crumb of credit may be due for standing up to Modi in response to the assassination of Sikh separatist Hardeep Nijjar on Canadian soil, domestically Trudeau has been about as Liberal as the DPRK is democratic.\nAfter imposing a draconian lockdown and vaccine mandates on Canadians, Trudeau responded to the trucker protests by passing the E̶n̶a̶b̶l̶i̶n̶g̶ Emergencies Act. The vile authoritarianism represented by the act cannot be overstated. Trudeau’s fascist (not a term to be used lightly) legislation permitted the freezing of protestors’ bank accounts and legalised police brutally in a 21st Century Western “democracy.”\nAlmost as shameful was the deafening silence of other world leaders at the time, including our own Prime Minister – who was probably looking to see what he could get away with himself. And Johnson had the gall to describe himself as a Libertarian. In contrast, Canadian Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre praised the truckers and has promised to slash the size of the Canadian state. As with Trump, only time will tell if such promises come to fruition.\nFrontrunners to take over Canada’s top job in the meantime include Mark Carney (yes, Project Fear’s Mark Carney- the bloke who decisively defecated on any semblance of political impartiality as governor of The Bank of England) and fittingly, former Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland, who suggested that questions regarding The Bank of Canada’s impartiality were “undermining the economy.” Not having had enough social repression, Canada’s “Liberal” Party is clearly intent on combining it with an extra helping of fiscal authoritarianism.\nFortunately Trudeau’s parting gift to his party is rock-bottom popularity. The Canadian Conservatives are currently enjoying a stonking 22% lead in the latest polls, and Trudeau’s “Liberals” may even return to their traditional third place, this time behind the socialist New Democratic party.\nWhoever replaces him, the impending departure of Justin Trudeau is a cause for celebration amongst Liberty-lovers worldwide, however tempered those celebrations might be by the sad reality that Trudeau is unlikely to serve prison time for his crimes. Amongst Western leaders of recent times, perhaps only Jacinda Ardern ever came close to challenging Trudeau on levels of megalomaniacal disdain for individual liberty.",

  "https_libertarianpartyuk_com_/https_libertarianpartyuk_com_is-aid-a-good-thing/content_4.html": "“Aid is not bad … because it is sometimes misused, corrupt or crass; rather, it is inherently bad, bad to the bone, and utterly beyond reform.”\nNot my words, but those of prominent journalist, Graham Hancock. He was the East Africa correspondent of The Economist from 1981 to 1983, covering the distribution of aid by select partners. The content of his book, Lords of Poverty: The Power, Prestige, And Corruption of The International Aid Business (1989) was drawn from his experience reporting on international aid for The Economist. Critics agreed that Hancock’s work was a powerful critique of the international aid system, though a number disagreed with Hancock’s thesis that aid was inherently bad.\nI’d argue little has changed. European Union policy runs heavily on the premise of keeping Africa poor. The protectionist bloc applies tariffs to finished products from Africa, whilst allowing raw materials to be traded tariff-free. It has led to Germany being the second largest producer of ground coffee in the world, despite not growing a bean.\nThe “Free Stuff” in International Aid suppresses the local market. A farmer, struggling to grow food in an arid land has no chance of selling produce when people can just help themselves to sacks of flour, or whatever, off the back of a UN wagon. Net result is the farmer not trying. Economist, Dambisa Moyo argues that aid has made African countries poorer and growth slower. Aid, coupled with the EU tariffs, there is a disincentive for entrepreneurs who might otherwise start up businesses to create employment and wealth.\nAid is often directed based on geopolitical and economic interests rather than need. The UK and US, for example, direct aid to countries that are significant markets or of geopolitical importance, such as Nigeria, Syria, Pakistan, Israel, Egypt, and Jordan. This means that the poorest countries often receive less aid than they need.\nNo one wants to see people starving and it is good that the West can come together in times of genuine need, but the current system needs a massive overhaul and reduction in size. To do that opposes the distribution agencies, like UNRWA and Red Cross. How could the CEOs justify their huge salaries if their operation was slashed? Until then, the taxpayer continues to be bled dry and the poorest nations on earth remain poor. Trade, not Aid id the way forward.\nMartin Day – Treasurer",

Traffic accidents kill at least 1.2 million, and alcohol 2.6 million.\nInteresting then that the least dangerous of these activities is the most vilified by States and social conservatives worldwide.\nWhile it is possible that decriminalisation may lead to an uptick in usage, the evidence suggests otherwise. In 2019, almost a decade after decriminalisation, Portugal logged a grand total of 74 drug deaths, working out to approximately 6 per million of population, compared to 284 per million in Scotland.\nFor Libertarians however, such morbid statistical discussion is largely an irrelevance – the individual is sovereign, and that should be the basis of all policy. As long as the taxpayer is not forced to fund drug treatment, it is quite frankly nobody else’s business what people choose to put into their own bodies.\nMention the word “drugs” and many on the right seize up and abandon all reason. Some think smoking a little herb to be the work of the devil, often waxing lyrical about the dangers of drugs after polishing off their third glass of pinot grigio. The sanctimonious judgement of social conservatives has no place in the Libertarian tradition.\nWhat then, of the non-agression principle? It may be reasonable to suggest that drug use does infringe on the liberty of others, such as family members and employers.\nWhile no one is suggesting we criminalise sloth, or mental illness, or being a socialist, (the three often interlinked) these are just as likely to have an impact on an individual’s ability to live up to their obligations as is drug use. Occasional responsible drug use need not necessarily become problematic – as my mother loves to say, everything in moderation!\nIt is also worth considering not only the freedom that comes with bodily autonomy, but the huge increase in safety that would come with legalisation.\nA approximately half of drug deaths are not caused by overdoses, but by the unintended consumption of adulerants such as fentanyl. When you know what’s in the product you’re taking, and the right dose, you’re much less likely to die.\nMany proponents of legalisation also point to the potential tax revenue it would be bring. While as long as Labour are in power such revenue is likely to be wasted in a heartbeat on DEI, Net Zero, Mauritius or some other nonsense, the point remains that taxing drugs would help in tackling our crippling national debt. Since it would be a tax paid only by those who freely choose to consume drugs, as Libertarians we may be able to hold our nose and accept a small sales tax of a few percentage points on recreational drugs – in exchange for a safe product and tax reductions elsewhere.\nWelcoming drugs into the free market not only raises individual autonomy and revenue but has the added benefit of fighting crime. The global trade in illicit drugs is believed to be worth about $650 billion a year, greater than the GDP of Sweden. That’s a lot of cash in dodgy hands. These billions could be snatched from the hands of violent traffickers and gangs in an instant. Analysts suggest an additional $100 billion in savings for law enforcement agencies. That the anti-drug lobby would rather force their moralistic worldview on others than curb the influence of gangs shows us where their true priorities really lie.\nFrom gang crime to drugs deaths, the war on drugs causes the problems that people attribute to the drugs themselves. It is high time for full legalisation.\nAlex Zychowski",

Figures about to be released show a NET figure of some 908,000. This follows a previous high in the last documented year of 743,000. It is unsustainable. Anyone who says immigration has not caused the housing shortage is being disingenuous, to say the least.\nAs a libertarian, I have no quarrel with anyone, from any part of the world, who wants to come to the UK. BUT, and it is a big but, they must be able to supp0ort themselves. Either they bring a sizeable amount of moneywith them to start their new life, or they have skills that we need in the UK.\nThe benefit tap must be turned off. The 85% young male illegal migrants are capable of supporting themselves – in their own countries. As a nation, the UK has always taken pride in offering a refuge for genuine refugees. They can be found in camps throughout the world, old, young and women who are less able to march across continents and huddle down in a dinghy, trying to keep their smart phones dry, after paying inflated sums of money to the smugglers who run the operation.\nThe simple statement that there is nothing to be gained by risking lives in these boats will be enough to slash the numbers. Imagine paying £3-5k to a people trafficker, only to arrive in the promised land of milk and honey, only to find they had run out of both. There is a strong chance a good few will be wanting their money back.\nSo, Mr Davos-loving Prime Minister, it is time to do the right thing by the people in your country, not Mr Schwab and his cronies. The boats, though, are a relatively small part of the problem. Legal migration must be put on hold, too. Train our own people for the roles needed istead of importing others.
