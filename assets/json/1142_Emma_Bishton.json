My county councillor, James Finch, recently chose to vote for cuts to the fire service in Suffolk, as well as cuts to community transport, library services and childrens’ centres (and so many other local services I can’t list them all here). It’s hard to find out what my district councillor voted for recently, but last year she opted to sell off a rare vacant council house on the spurious grounds that- at 1.5 miles from the village centre – it was ‘remote’ (apparently people who need council houses don’t get to choose to live in the country). What strikes me about all these elected people is not their enthusiasm for wielding the knife (whether socially or financially) but their continued insistence on presenting their actions as if they are immutable and inevitable.\nThe leader of Suffolk County Council, Cllr Colin Noble, has described their budget decisions in the letter that arrived with my council tax this week as “not ones we want to take, but have to take”. Yet their actions are far from pre-determined. They are, in fact, actions based on choices. People in government at all levels have to make choices a lot of the time – that’s what we elect them for. We don’t expect them to be experts in everything, but we do, reasonably, expect them, as our representatives, to be able to weigh up the evidence in order to make choices on our behalf. And making choices on our behalf surely means choosing actions that will, at the very least, not harm people? (After all it’s worth remembering that as our representatives they are supposed to act in the interests of all of their electors, not just the ones who voted for them.) Actively choosing to harm people is so very much worse than inadvertently causing people difficulty, or not being able to make things better.\nWhat is more, the choices made by one elected representative have a direct bearing on the choices made by another. The disabled person with less money to live on thanks to the choice made by James Cartlidge will be less able to get out of their house, and less likely to be able to access support from their local library because of the choices made by James Finch (and don’t get me started on how their health and social care is affected). That’s an impoverished and lonely picture – with obvious knock-on effects to the people’s physical and mental health. In sum, our elected representatives are each making choices that harm the wellbeing of people who have no choice about needing help in the first place, but without apparent consideration of the overall impact of their collective choices.\nThe party in control in my local council are the same ones in control of the government (this probably won’t surprise you). So in theory at least, they are freed from political difficulties and have the potential to make choices based on the impact across the system as a whole. But no, instead they each have their own set of knives AND their own chopping boards, and they appear to wield them in unconnected kitchens.\nI really don’t know why it is that Conservatives are so good at presenting punishments for the elderly, infirm and disabled as necessary actions undertaken for our own good (though not for the first time I’m reminded of the bully in the school playground). Or how they get away with pretending that there are no choices left for them to make. But I’m pretty sure they would be the first to act differently if they found themselves on the receiving end of their own choices. And I’m very sure that if they were making choices relating to the viability of their own businesses, they’d at least be meeting in the same kitchen.\nPosted by Richard Fernandez on 15 March 2016 at 1:27 am\nPresumably that ‘remote’ council house was remote when it was built.

  "https_emmabishton_wordpress_com/https_emmabishton_wordpress_com_2018_01_24_what-price-democracy/content_6.html": "Earlier today I received a phone call on behalf of Babergh District Council, asking for my views on the proposed merger of Babergh with Mid Suffolk district council. Sadly I only got to answer the preliminary questions, as it turns out that they have already filled their quota of people in my age group. (A shame, I’d welcome the chance to give Babergh some feedback on this particular issue.)\nAs regular readers of the Suffolk Free Press (Sudbury edition) will be aware, Babergh’s Tory council has got its knickers in a twist. Late last year the council’s cabinet discussed proposals to merge with Mid Suffolk council, in order to make further cost savings. Given that merger must involve the dissolution of a council (and the loss of council seats), you might reasonably expect that this issue would have been discussed robustly and widely. Oh no. The council’s cabinet (just seven out of 42 councillors) discussed it, apparently of the view that at this stage the proposal didn’t need to be discussed by anyone else (who might, presumably, disagree with them).\nThere’s a back story. This isn’t the first time Babergh has talked about merging.\n(As an aside, the change in the rules since 2011 must be a rare example of forward planning from our Conservative governent. The plan goes something like this:\n- get rid of the requirement for councils to consult residents about getting changes to their council\n- more councils (or more specifically, more Tory councils in the shires) merge with each other\n- merged councils have fewer councillors overall. That brings some small cost savings (savings have already been made from sharing services and staff, after all).\n- fewer people feel connected with their councillor, as they cover a wider area (residents are less likely to see them let alone know them in rural areas). So fewer residents see the point of voting in local elections or know who to complain to when things aren’t going well\n- More councils return a Tory council for evermore.\nAt least, that is I presume the intention.)\nI do find it baffling, in a country that prides itself on its democratic processes, that our councils can dissolve themselves and merge at whim. In behaving in this way it’s as if the only thing that matters is how cheaply the councils can deliver a set of basic services, rather than demonstrating what it means to be the local part of our democratically elected system of government (though the question ‘what are councils for?’ is beyond the scope of this post!). Thankfully in this case Labour and other opposition councillors applied council rules to ensure that the issue was properly debated and scrutinised by full council. The consequences of all this are 1) that Babergh commissioned ComRes to carry out a phone survey of a representative sample of residents about the merger (the reason I was called), 2) the council leader was deposed, 3) a new leader was installed (who now insists he is in favour of a referendum) – and the Tories are in complete disarray. And all the while, they are distracted from doing something that might actually be useful.\nI can’t help thinking that they get away with all this because few of us know what councils do – unless or until we happen to need their services (or at least services other than refuse collection). And of course what councils do isn’t at all the same as what councils could do if they properly exercised their strategic leadership role in their locality (and, of course, if they weren’t continually subject to funding cuts by central govenrment, which is what has ultimately caused all this trouble).\nBack to the phone survey. Now it doesn’t take much effort to realise that the easiest way to get the desired answers from any survey is to ask questions that don’t allow for any other kind of answers, as a number of local residents have already found out. When I asked the ComRes caller what he would have asked me, had I been eligible to continue with the survey, he said ‘what I like’ and ‘what I don’t like’ about the area, as well as my view on the proposed merger. Not exactly seizing the opportunity to inform residents of what the council does, what they might like it to do – or even how to make sure they are registered to vote. A letter in last week’s Suffolk Free Press suggests this survey is costing Babergh £20,000 – the price to be paid for this pretense of democracy. Even if Babergh were to recover their democratic sensibilities and afford a whole referendum, real democracy is well beyond the current council’s reach.",
  "https_emmabishton_wordpress_com/https_emmabishton_wordpress_com_tag_town-centres/content_79.html": "The following letter was published in the East Anglian Daily Times on Friday 31st May, in response to an article in the same paper a few days previously. That article covered a meeting between the local MP, Tim Yeo, and a group of business owners from Sudbury, Hadleigh and large villages nearby, which the business owners had requested in order to discuss reforms needed to the system for determining business rates. Reports since indicate that Mr Yeo has pledged to take their concerns to Eric Pickles, the Communities Secretary, providing that they can demonstrate that their increase in business rates over the last 10 years is out of proportion to their rise in turnover. This doesn’t, of course, address the fundamental problem the business owners wished to address – namely that the system for determining business rates favours out-of-town outlets over town-centre premises – but it might at least be the start of a discussion.\nDear Sir\nI was surprised by Tim Yeo’s response to Sudbury business owners as reported in last week’s EADT (MP blames internet shopping for decline in High Street, May 24th). He is chair of the Select Committee on Energy and Climate Change, and has far greater understanding than many of his government colleagues of the energy issues facing us, and the need to ensure communities are sustainable. Yet in refusing to address the key issue – that it is harder to make a profit for a small town-centre business than it is for an out-of-town retail outlet which pays lower rates – he misses the opportunity to support both the social and economic structure of local communities and to promote lower-carbon ways of shopping. And why no reference to Mary Portas – his government’s advisor on high streets?\nIn presenting his view of the future Mr Yeo also appears not to know that many people cannot easily travel to out-of-town retail outlets, and that very many people – especially amongst the elderly – are neither keen on nor confident shopping via the internet. He may wish to retire to a market town where there is nothing to do but move from one coffee shop to another (excellent as many of them are), but I don’t imagine most of his constituents do.\nyours sincerely\nEmma Bishton",
  "https_emmabishton_wordpress_com/https_emmabishton_wordpress_com_2019_01_01_the-department-for-education-2018-in-review/content_8.html": "I’m a core member of the parent campaign group Rescue our Schools. We campaign for changes in our education system so that our children can be equipped with the skills and attributes necessary for life in the 21st century, and their schools and teachers have the resources and respect required for this to happen. We have a six-point manifesto for change in our education system, and I spent a couple of days this week reviewing just how the Department for Education has fared against these in the last year. Caution: it makes for unhappy reading. But it is also a call to action. 2019 is the year we must see positive change for our schools, our children and our future.\n- Invest in all our futures\nRequires improvement. The Department began the year with a new Education Secretary, Damian Hinds. Unlike his predecessor, Justine Greening, he came as a supporter of grammar schools (presumably one of the reasons he was appointed). Other than occasional announcements like the recent ones that children should climb trees (there’s an idea we’d never have thought of!) and that schools should reduce single-use plastics (they have, after all, nothing else to do), little else has changed. Education policy continues to be dominated by three things: a refusal to acknowledge that schools and early years settings need more funding to do the job asked of them, the desire to push testing to extremes and in doing so prioritise the able over the less able, and the continued marketisation of schools achieved by the ongoing push of schools away from local authorities and into academy chains. The recruitment and retention of staffing in schools, meanwhile, remains at crisis point.\nOur Christmas message in 2017 focused on funding and the rising pressures on schools seeking to accommodate the increase in cost pressures affecting our schools. How depressing, then, to still be leading on this a year later. And this despite the unprecedented sight, in September, of 2000 headteachers protesting ‘relentlessly reasonably’ on Whitehall, followed in October by a campaign organised by our sister campaign group Save our Schools in which pupils directly addressed MPs in parliament. After months of campaigning there was, in December, one important and welcome announcement: an increase in high needs funding for children with special educational needs and disabilities. This will help some children, but it isn’t enough. And it doesn’t begin to address the core funding problems facing schools across the country, many of which are having to ask parents to fund pencils and paper (the kind of thing Philip Hammond presumably had in mind when he talked about schools needing those ‘little extras’!).\n2. Promote inclusive education for all\nFail. Changes to funding for local authorities, combined with funding pressures on school budgets, have made it extremely difficult for schools to meet the needs of children with special education needs – a situation which not only discriminates against children with additional needs and their families; it potentially harms all children. Yet the level of need is clear; as of this year, 14.6% of pupils are on the SEN register. They are failed not only by inadequate levels of support (cost pressures reducing access to teaching assistants, for example), but also by the increased focus on exams and testing. Our own survey about the new GCSEs highlighted the punitive and emotionally devastating impact of the new exam regime for pupils with special educational needs such as autism. Meanwhile some parents are having to crowd-fund legal action in order to secure the required specialist support for their children from local authorities. The playing field is now so far from level that it is ceasing to offer many children an opportunity to play at all.\n3. Promote education over exam factories\nHard to know where to start, in the year that pupils sat the new GCSEs and A levels which are based almost exclusively on exams designed to favour those with good memories and high literacy skills, and in which primary schools started piloting baseline testing in reception. RoS had a busy summer surveying parents and teachers about the impact of the new GCSEs, and in ongoing campaigning with fellow organisations as part of More than a Score, seeking to reform SATs and end the link between test results and school accountability. (Have a look at this video about the #BigSATsSitIn – you can also sample the tests for yourself!) The impact of testing on pupil wellbeing has been questioned over and over again, in a year which also saw independent evidence of the rise of mental ill-health and poor emotional wellbeing in children and young people. RoS’ petition to address this was endorsed by Natasha Devon, former government mental health champion, amongst others. As the year drew to a close, the former head of the civil service added his voice to those concerned about the long-term impact on our children’s wellbeing. We will continue to campaign loudly and vigorously on this in 2019.\n4. Develop Creativity in all its forms\nAnother fail. Not surprisingly, given the pressure on resources and the perpetual drive from ministers to prioritise testing in traditional academic subjects (in SATs and by use of the Ebacc) over giving pupils a broad educational experience. Over the year, we have been able to highlight on social media work done in some of the most creative – and successful – schools bucking the trend, both in terms of access to arts subjects and activities, and creative approaches to teaching and learning overall.\nThe UK has traditionally excelled in the creative industries. Yet 2018 saw another year-on-year reduction in access to arts subjects throughout the curriculum, in GCSE entries for subjects such as music, drama, art, design technology and more, and consequently in employment of teachers in these subjects. In 2019 we need your help to promote this message all the more, before the situation becomes irreversible.\n5. Let expert evidence inform policy\nNo progress. There are many experts. There are many policy makers. But the one rarely seems to inform the other, except occasionally when referring to evidence that supports ideas currently in fashion in the DfE (those that support the use of synthetic phonics, for example).\nOne of the areas in which the evidence is overwhelming clear is that grammar schools do not improve attainment overall. Yet this year we have seen funding prioritised to expand grammar schools on the grounds that these schools will justify the increase in funding by widening access to pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds. Meanwhile, organisations such as the Education Policy Institute have published more evidence on the attainment gap for pupils on free school meals, and NHS research documented an increase in mental ill-health in young people While the government prioritises resources on pursuing a grammar school agenda not backed up by evidence, some schools are having to team up with local charities to provide breakfast clubs for children in poverty.\n6. Ensure local accountability for all schools\nAgain, there have been no shortage of concerns and failures in Multi Academy Chains, and both the Parliamentary Accounts Committee and the Education Select Committee have been increasingly critical of the problems with the Academies model. Stories range from the failure of a whole MAT, the rise of fixed-term exclusions, prescriptive teaching, high levels of executive pay, and significant concerns about misuse of funds. Thanks to BBC’s Panorama programme, the pitfalls of the Multi Academy Trust model and its associated lack of oversight are now much better understood. We will continue to provide a platform on social media for local campaigns fighting forced academisation. But we also must acknowledge that local authorities are now considerably under-resourced to support schools, even where those schools remain in LEA control.\nAs the new year approaches, so does a new Ofsted accountability framework The headlines suggest they want to change the current focus on data, involve teachers and assess the breadth and substance of the curriculum in schools. We at RoS are parents – we understand the value of meaningful, robust and consistent assessment of how schools are meeting our children’s needs, and want to be sure our teachers and school leaders are appropriately supported. But changing the framework alone doesn’t give schools the resources, creative freedom and evidence they need to develop the education Ofsted claims to want to evaluate. Moreover there are worrying signs that the inspectorate may be moving towards directing schools ‘how‘ to teach – with an emphasis on memorising rather than acquisition of skills. Such a narrow view of education would only let children down and, if introduced, must be emphatically resisted. As we have done with previous consultations, RoS will be asking for your thoughts to inform our response when the consultation on the new framework is published in early 2019.\nOverall Assessment\nThroughout the year, the Department for Education has plunged deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole, in a constant bid to find its own alternate reality universe in which school budgets really are at a record high and standards really have been raised equitably with a meaningful impact on pupils’ futures. Whilst it has being doing this, the UK Statistics Authority has found cause to write to the DfE no fewer than FOUR times in 2018 about misleading use of education statistics. With all government stagnating due to Brexit, the DfE appears to find its own version of the Mad Hatters tea party quite a comforting place to be. But schools, pupils and parents do not.\nOur Rescue our Schools message for 2019 is clear: the children and young people in school now cannot afford to wait another year for the government to wake up to its own responsibilities. We must join together, and act.",

But you are fiddling while Rome burns, though I grant you, the fire is not of your making. All around us schools are dealing with severe funding pressures as a direct consequence of Tory government policy – and having to resort to measures such as larger class sizes and cutting teaching assistants. And access to creative subjects which should be engines for equality is increasingly reserved for those who can afford to pay. All these measures will have a direct and lasting negative impact on the next generation, even if they leave school less hungry than they do now.\nAt some future time there’s definitely a lot to be gained from discussing the potential benefit of universal free school meals and from getting rid of the tax freedoms enjoyed by private schools. But right now this policy is distracting from the fundamental issues which Labour needs to be responding to. Meanwhile, parents who can are switching off from Labour and turning to private education in the hope that this will give their children ‘the best chance’. All of which makes the chances of this policy becoming an own goal really rather high.\nThis pernicious Tory government is spending considerable amounts of energy reducing funds and opportunities for this generation and the next. You have the opportunity to set the terms and the scope of the debate on what is really needed to make our education system deliver the best chance for all our children. Please Mrs Rayner, give us the big picture first before filling in the detail.\nPosted by ianpointon on 8 April 2017 at 9:11 pm\nI agree Emma. Giving the next generation ‘the best chance’ will need much more than a decision about school meals. Doesn’t it, however, highlight a major problem?\nGiving kids the best chance is nowadays seen as the responsibility, solely, of their parents. In successfully gaming a complex and fragmented education landscape. So, when a school goes broke, reduces subjects, makes teachers or support staff redundant, responsibility for these impacts on children rests with parents for making ‘wrong’ choices about their kids education. They have no locus other than as consumers as political accountability is removed.\nIt’s unarguable Emma, that the free school meals policy fails to address the fundamental issue of the resources allocated to children’s education. That it’s being led on now points up a wider political problem afflicting education and a range of other policy areas.",
  "https_emmabishton_wordpress_com/https_emmabishton_wordpress_com_2019_05_30_splitting-the-village/content_38.html": "The full impact of Suffolk County Council’s new home-school transport policy is becoming clear. As reported in this week’s East Anglian Daily Times, families in my village and many others are being punished by the council for no other reason than living on the wrong street. The new policy (which calculates distances to school to the nearest metre, using home postcodes), will divide primary school classmates by providing them with transport to different schools, against their parents’ wishes. Last week I attended Suffolk County Council meeting to ask a public question about the new policy. I asked whether the council was aware that their new policy was creating splits in some villages, where children are now being offered free transport to different schools. (This is a particular problem for children going to secondary school in September). The response of the councillor responsible (SCC Cabinet member for Children’s Services, Education and Skills) was that there might be some short-term increase in costs where it will result in two buses going to different schools instead of one bus going to one school, while the policy is phased in. But he also said that because some parents already choose to go to non-catchment schools, split villages weren’t considered an issue. He suggested that parents and schools might come up with ‘local solutions’ for the ‘two-school’ problem including parents doing lift-shares and schools offering their own transport.\nHe seemed to be either conflating or confusing different things, so I asked again, pointing out that parental choice and the county’s legal obligations to provide school transport are separate issues, and outlining the problem in Nayland. (After all, parents only choose to send their children to non-catchment schools when they can afford to do so.) It so happens that two of the county councillors live in this village. According to the Council’s nearest school checker, one lives in one of the streets now designated for Hadleigh High School (with which our primary has no links and to which there is no bus service). The other lives in the part of the village still designated for Thomas Gainsborough School in Sudbury (our historical catchment school, with good links to our primary school and on a public bus route). The split occurs at our primary school, which for historical reasons has two postcodes; one is now apparently ‘nearer’ to Hadleigh and one to Thomas Gainsborough. Yes really.\nYou’d think the sensible response to this kind of inefficient and unfair situation would be to say “we need to look at that unintended consequence”, yet the councillor responsible merely reiterated his view that because some parents choose to send their children to grammar schools over the county border, we are already a ‘split village’ and that by implication, the resulting chaos is not a concern.\nThe result of this policy is that in villages like Nayland, some parents will be forced to pay upwards of £750 per child per year in order for their child to do nothing more unusual than moving up to secondary school with their classmates. For these families, the policy amounts to an opportunistic extra tax. The alternative is that children in families for whom this is unaffordable will have to go a different school from their classmates – child and family effectively being discriminated against for having less money than others. It has to be noted that the council seems to have little understanding that £750 (minimum per child) is a significant sum of additional money for young families to find. Either way, the council’s new policy amounts to a postcode lottery. And all of this was both predictable, and predicted.\nThere’s a further complication for the schools concerned. If pupils end up going to schools they did not choose to go to instead of the school they already have secured a place in, those schools won’t get the budgets they are expecting this year. And relationships with feeder primaries are totally disrupted, making it much harder to plan smooth school transitions for children moving to secondary school in future years. (Schools are funded on a per-pupil basis, and schools are organising their provision around the numbers of pupils they are expecting to receive come September.)\nI was astonished by the lack of interest – let alone sympathy to the affected families – shown by the council in response to my questions. The councillor responsible for schools should be aware that schools don’t have spare management time or budget to put on buses. And the council should surely be more interested in what happens IN schools – and therefore be wanting schools to use resources on education, not petrol. If the county council was actually planning to review school catchments and admissions, including for schools still in LEA control – it should do so based on some actual analysis of the need for school places relative to the locations and types of schools, not just redefine school relationships as an unintentional consequence of reducing access to school buses. And it ought to consult with schools themselves.\nI don’t know whether the council is wilfully confusing parental choice with its legal responsibilities for school transport, or simply doesn’t understand the policy framework. Either way, it shows little regard for the wellbeing of children anxious they won’t now go to the same school as their classmates, for their parents, school budgets, or the environment. It couldn’t be clearer that councillors are hoping parents will just pick up the bill for a responsibility that sits with the council.\nSeveral years ago, the county council set about the contentious and messy process of closing all the county’s middle schools with the goal of smoothing the transition from primary to secondary school, because, they said, this would help them to achieve better educationally. It seems they no longer care about the pupils, given the indifference they are showing to parents and pupils caught up in a policy blunder brought about by the poor implementation of a bad policy. Please, Suffolk County Council, there is still time to pull your head out of the sand. Postpone the implementation of this policy and go back to the drawing board.\nPosted by mrs mary e rice on 30 May 2019 at 8:16 pm\ni thought bullying was a priority to be stamped out between children in schools but it looks like suffolk county council are now the bullies.the children whose parents cant afford it and have to go to another school and not be with their friends can have devastating affects on the individual child .all this upset because you live in nayland but on the wrong side of the street .",
  "https_emmabishton_wordpress_com/https_emmabishton_wordpress_com_2016_07_22_in-pursuit-of-joy/content_14.html": "It’s been a busy couple of weeks. No I don’t mean trying to keep up with the headlines or the fallout from the headlines, though I can’t say that isn’t also a challenge. I mean domestically. It’s the end of term, so there has been a procession of concerts and (intentionally) dramatic events to attend, a street fair, a fete, end of term assemblies and so on. This year is different because it’s my daughter’s last at primary school. Which means, of course, that she leaves not only with a set of wonderful memories and burgeoning opportunities, but with a set of SATS results.\nA week or so ago we had our school summer concert (which I help with, as I’m involved with music at school). This was the 8th of these annual events, and quite possibly the best yet. They always follow the same format: choirs, ukulele group and recorder group have a standing slot, and most of the rest of the programme is given over to pupil performances – anything from solo songs to dance routines. Pupils audition for a slot in the programme, for which they devise and rehearse their own pieces. Variety is more important than perfection – over the years we’ve had all sorts from Mozart on the horn to solo renditions of Take That songs. This year, one of the highlights for me was the ‘Kingfisher boys’ – a group of year 3 boys (complete with baseball caps), one singer in the middle of five dancers – including some rather skilful breakdancing. It wasn’t note-perfect or movement-perfect. But it was exuberant, entertaining, and above all joyful. Like a lot else in the summer concert, it was impossible to watch without smiling.\nThe other thing that happened that day was that their school reports came out. These, for those lucky children in year 6, included their SATS results. In an attempt to explain the reporting of SATS results, the headteacher usefully included a flyer written for parents by the government Standards and Testing Agency. It goes on about the government’s desire to raise standards, and includes statements which of course presage an intentionally higher number of ‘failures’ than previously: “As the new standard is higher than the old one, fewer children have met the new expected standard than the previous standard”, and then goes on to suggest that parents go online to find out how their child’s results compare with the national average (which smacks rather of trying to generate fear of failure in parents as well as pupils, rather than drawing on the more positive effects of competition). The leaflet also suggests that tests and teacher assessments help teachers in secondary school to target extra help. Well my daughter’s test results didn’t tell us anything we didn’t already know about her or anything she didn’t already know about herself. Nor, more importantly, did they tell her teacher anything she didn’t already know and couldn’t already communicate to the secondary school in a teacher assessment. So what, you might wonder, was the point of all that anguish back in May?\nThe leaflet appears to suggest that more children failing the tests will result in them having a better “mastery of the basics” (I’m really not sure that ‘fronted adverbials’ are basic, but that’s another matter). But whilst it’s made clear that the SATS system has been specifically engineered to create more ‘failures’ than ‘successes’, for this year at least, the leaflet doesn’t explain how ‘failing’ might actually help a child learn. (I can of course see how such engineering will help the government claim to have improved standards in a couple of years time, but that’s another matter also.) It doesn’t explain it because it can’t explain it. Back in May, my daughter feared the tests, though in the event she did fine. That fear wasn’t productive, it was just a waste of emotional energy. And generating fear of failure in parents by frequent use of words like ‘mastery’ and ‘expected standard’ is simply unacceptable, as well as being unlikely to result in pupils actually doing better.\nIn our summer concerts, on the other hand, there are no failures. In eight years of summer concerts, I have never seen a child crumble on stage. True, some enjoy performing more than others, some are more engaging than others, some have practised more or display more talent than others – but they all get up on the stage and take pleasure in having done so. Those Kingfisher Boys applied themselves to the task, thought creatively and worked collaboratively, listened to advice and put it into practice (and rose to the challenge of performing in front of at least 200 people). All rather useful skills for life, let alone for learning. But SATS tests don’t value any of those attributes at all. Instead they have tested whether my daughter and her peers can produce a piece of writing in time and remember various facts and processes. I’m not seeking to denigrate the value of learning these things in themselves (except much of the content of the SPaG test, of course). But I question their value for our children’s overall emotional and cognitive development. Children find joy in things that they value and that they get satisfaction from learning – whether that’s on stage, on the cricket pitch or indeed, with a skilled teacher, in a classroom. And that joy spurs them on. Testing for the sake of testing, on the other hand, eviscerates joy. I am heartily relieved, as my daughter prepares for secondary school, that she has been at a school which values the creative antics of boys in year 3 as highly as a few test results.\nPosted by titch1947 on 25 July 2016 at 11:05 am\nHi – could I have your permission to reblog this on http://www.wembleymatters.blogspot.co.uk – important to get this perspective across to as many people as possible. martinrfrancis@virginmedia.com\nPosted by Emma Bishton on 6 April 2017 at 11:54 pm\nyes of course please do",
  "https_emmabishton_wordpress_com/https_emmabishton_wordpress_com_2013_09_17_whose-town-is-it-anyway/content_54.html": "Tomorrow morning, Babergh Council Planning Committee will host the latest episode in the Hadleigh v Tesco saga. Tesco – having bought land in the town – have been trying to build in Hadleigh for many years, despite considerable opposition from local residents and shops. Hadleigh is a small attractive market town with a population of about 8000 people, and is home to several local shops as well as a Co-op and (from this year) a Morrisons supermarket on the town bypass. I shop there fairly often as I like the shops – most of those in Hadleigh are not only independent but also good shops in their own right. (That said I haven’t ever bought quails eggs in them, which our local MP Tim Yeo is proud to claim he has!)\nHadleigh has a distinctive town centre, due to the presence of a variety of shops, public services and places to eat. Town centres, and the communities within them, only thrive when used. How we use them is indeed changing, and will probably change much more in the next few years. But opening a supermarket within walking distance of a town centre doesn’t give that centre time to evolve – it just takes an axe to its economic and community potential, as I saw in a North Somerset town earlier this year. Does that matter? It depends what kind of world we want to live in, not just now but in our older age: one of the interesting things about town centres, or so it seems to me, is that they are used most by the generations least likely to be be making decisions about them.\nA poll of Hadleigh residents revealed that 73% are opposed to any supermarket on the site owned by Tesco. Babergh council’s economic development team (supported by independent academic and judicial reports) states that “the additional benefits created by a Tesco food store do not outweigh the impact on the high street and the wider economy and [they] consider that approval would have a negative effect on the sustainability and vitality of Hadleigh Town centre.”\nSo why are Babergh even having to consider an additional supermarket? Because (or so it seems to me) current arrangements dictate that big business ‘owns’ the debate. Apparently Tesco opposed the plans to build Morrisons. Perhaps not surprising when you consider that one of Tesco’s justifications for their store is that people have to travel to Ipswich or Colchester for their ‘main shop’ which, it would seem, can only be done in Tesco. It might be argued that Tesco comes in for particular vitriol, so would people mind as much if the proposal came from Waitrose? I hope so – the plans on the site concerned require compulsory purchase of the town’s allotments, building on a water meadow, safety concerns due to the narrowness of road access and of course the threat to the local shops and the local producers whose products are sold in them.\nHere’s the rub: if you spend £100 in a local independent business, between £50 and £70 of that money stays in the local economy. If you spend the same amount in a supermarket (any supermarket), only £10 continues to circulate locally. That’s partly why towns like Hadleigh, with a mix of independent shops serving a variety of needs, make nice places to live.\nPeople can only eat so much food, so there is only so much they will buy. Independent shops can’t survive as the ‘top-up’ service for goods that aren’t available in the supermarkets. And in Hadleigh, an extra supermarket simply isn’t fulfilling a need, just forcing a competition. Surely it’s time for Tesco to do the decent thing, as Costa did in Totnes, and recognise that it is not in fact needed everywhere?\nPosted by Emma Bishton on 18 September 2013 at 3:04 pm\nGood news doesn’t often come up, but it has today! Babergh planning committee rejected the proposal from Tesco as reported in the EADT here http://www.eadt.co.uk/news/hadleigh_council_rejects_plans_for_a_major_new_tesco_store_1_2676936",
  "https_emmabishton_wordpress_com/https_emmabishton_wordpress_com_tag_education/content_71.html": "One of the questions in this week’s edition of BBC Radio Four’s Any Questions concerned the state of education – as you might expect given that it is GCSE results week. As has become the norm in any commentary about education these days, the discussion moved from the merits of the changes to GCSE marking to the choice of subjects being studied, and on to the customarily shrill debate about whether ‘the system’ as a whole needs to be changed, yet again. And from one panellist came the familiar assertion that ‘the system is clearly failing so should be reformed’.\nGovernment and media reports and neighbourhood conversations about schools are polarised. Schools are either labelled ‘excellent’ (albeit rarely these days) or ‘failing’ – an emotive term unlikely to instil anything but fear or despair in most parents and teachers. But this ‘system’ contains not only the schools (there are more than 24,000 in England alone not to mention other aspects such as pre-school provision, alternative provision and Local Education Authorities), but also the complex rules which govern what happens in them – exams, curriculum etc. And it’s a system which operates in, and seeks to mitigate, an unequal world – otherwise all children would enter the system with the same chances of success, which they don’t.\nSo just as with any other large entity, it’s quite likely that at any one time, not everything is working as well as it might. This isn’t an excuse for failure, but a plea for a broader perspective. Allowing ‘the system’ as a whole to be rubbished just increases the anxiety for parents that their children will be failed by it – not a promising start for any child as parents should be encouraged to engage in their children’s schooling, not spending all their time worrying or looking for other schools. Why politicians and pundits think that it makes sense to both exhort parents to support their children in their schooling and spend considerable effort rubbishing the exams those children will take or the schools they will take them in, I don’t understand. They may do either with good intent, but the resultant conflict just creates confusion for parents.\nSo what should the system be doing? Ensuring that all children can access a well-rounded education which equips them to be adult citizens (which is not at all the same thing as all pupils getting A grades in lots of GCSEs). ‘The system’ might be better placed to do this if it were properly supported to identify and address any issues from within (as the Heads Roundtable have been doing for the last few months), not being constantly subjected to change from the outside.\nWhen the people in the education system are busy either making or rebutting charges of failure, the system as a whole is distracted from identifying and addressing those aspects which are not working as well as they need to.\nSo instead, as we approach a new school year, why can’t we start focusing on the things that do work, and on helping spread such good practice across the system? Talk the system up instead of down. Take some of the fear and despair out, and we as parents might feel a bit more like stakeholders, a bit less like puppets, and a bit more able to support our children through their school life.",
  "https_emmabishton_wordpress_com/https_emmabishton_wordpress_com_2012_10_01_where-is-the-bar/content_70.html": "Suffolk County Council, with the RSA, have launched an inquiry into education and learning in Suffolk – “Raising the Bar”, amidst concerns that attainment is not as it high as it should be. They are right to be concerned; Suffolk is a relatively affluent county (though affluence at county level masks areas of significant deprivation) and results are therefore not as high as might be expected. For some years, SCC have blamed lower attainment on the three-tier system, hence the closure of middle schools which is now underway. Others might (in my view reasonably) attribute some of the effect to relatively low funding in our Suffolk schools, but that is presumably beyond discussion at this point.\nThe schools reorganisation will not be complete for some while, and there is much systemic change taking place simultaneously as well as the RSA Inquiry, plus four new free schools which we are told will raise standards, so it is unclear what results will be attributed to which intervention over what time-frame. Leaving that aside, ‘Raising the Bar’ is laudable in its own right. My problem with Raising the Bar is not its purpose, not its aims, nor the call for ideas, and especially not the desire to bring parents and teachers into the debate. My problem is working out where ‘the bar’ is. To be fair, this is not just a problem in Suffolk, it is a problem across the English system.\nOur primary schools are generally well-received. Our secondary schools, on the other hand, mostly get a bashing. (And this was the case before Michaels Gove and Wilshaw started adding to the diatribe). According to the politicians and much of the media, our schools and teachers fail our children: they don’t get enough qualifications, those qualifications aren’t hard enough to achieve or don’t equip them for work (and as of this year, the grading of these qualifications appears rather arbitrary anyway).\nAs a parent, of course I want my children to get a good range of qualifications which will equip them for whatever the next stage of their life is. But that isn’t all I want from their education: I want them to have opportunities for creativity and physical activity, and I want the school to help them to be emotionally and physically fit and healthy, able to make effective and morally-sound judgements, and to demonstrate the kinds of social skills which are useful for life, never mind the workplace. An English Baccalaureate doesn’t show me any of those things. Yes, I know, a lot of that is also my job as a parent. But not exclusively – school shows them that the views of parents aren’t arbitrary but exist within a system, and helps them get the hang of how to operate in that system. There are quite a lot of schools that do all this, and more, already. But they don’t get recognised for it unless the school also gets above a magic percentage of A*-C at GCSE and an Outstanding Ofsted. And continues to do so. (We are stuck in a peculiar dilemma – if students’ results improve the exams must be easier, but if schools’ results (from these same students) don’t improve, the schools are failing in their task.)\nStatistically (and despite the protestations of many free school proposers) schools can’t all get better results than each other, nor can they all be in the top 10%. A bit of reality would be helpful here – literally raising the bar is what will help more pupils than raising the attainment of a few, and anything which helps achieve this from this review will be worth pursuing. But I digress – what I really hope will come out of this review is some way of understanding when our schools are performing well in more ways than simply counting GCSEs or EBacs. And of celebrating that, rather than being drawn in to the constant disparagement of our schools.\nHere’s hoping the Suffolk review really does lead to some thinking across the county about what our schools are for. Then we might be able to work out how to assess their achievement in more meaningful ways. Improvement will follow once we are sure what we are measuring and why.",
  "https_emmabishton_wordpress_com/https_emmabishton_wordpress_com_2017_06_05_three-days-to-go/content_5.html": "It’s been a lively but really interesting few weeks, full of visits and meetings, and with a strong and consistent presence in Sudbury town centre at weekends. I’ve met with WASPI women (denied access to their state pensions), childcare providers worried about meeting the unfunded demands on them set out by the Conservative government, representatives from the NFU very concerned about the impact of a hard Brexit on farmers (and consequently on the cost of food), and school leaders having to juggle budget cuts and recruitment problems. All of my visits and discussions have reinforced the need for a softer Brexit and investment in our public services – and demonstrated to me the commitment of local people to making Suffolk a vibrant and better place to live.\nI and the CLP team have been buoyed by the response of local party members and supporters to the campaign. The turnout for our leafleting session in Sudbury last Saturday was the biggest yet. There’s been a constant stream of requests for posters, and so many offers of help. The publication of the Labour manifesto, with its vision for a different way of doing things, has clearly been not only refreshing for us as members, but a turning point for the public. People in the street are talking about issues, and acknowledging that things can’t carry on as they are, with Conservative proposals for older people being a particular talking point.\nTheresa May called this election to deal with Brexit. Athough Brexit has featured in all three hustings debates and in conversation on the street, it has not been the main topic of discussion locally or nationally. This may be partly because of the horrific events in Manchester and London that have punctuated the campaign. But it is also because our public services have now reached a critical point, with cuts to, among others, school budgets and police numbers.\nBut Brexit does matter. It’s about our future. Yes, we need the investment in public services and infrastructure that is set out in the Labour manifesto, and we need that now. But as has been made absolutely clear to me during my visits in this campaign, our farmers, our services, and our young people need as good a deal as we can get, for our and their future. A second referendum isn’t a realistic option, so we need proper negotiations led by Keir Starmer.\nWe’re now in the final straight. I have a few visits left to do this week (including Hillside special school and Community Action Suffolk), and we plan to be leafleting at school gates as well as continuing to help Ipswich colleagues with their very strong – and we hope successful – campaign to elect Sandy Martin. Please do carry on with those one-on-one discussions, sharing messages on social media, and putting up those posters!\nEvery vote really does count.",
  "https_emmabishton_wordpress_com/https_emmabishton_wordpress_com_2016_06_13_pupils-go-to-market/content_13.html": "Last week I went with my daughter to the Suffolk Show. Big rural fairs aren’t everyone’s cup of tea, I appreciate, and seeing sheep, cows and working horses parade around the ring and wait for their prizes (the “Grand Parade”) may seem a bizarre anachronism in the modern age when most people probably don’t see a live pig from one year to the next, let alone a pig farmer. But – as well as providing lots of entertainment, a wealth of good food and numerous opportunities to buy horsey clothing – these country shows do provide those of us in more rural areas with a link between where we live and the farming industry which for centuries has been the mainstay of the rural economy.\nOne thing rural economies don’t breed much of these days is school-pupils. Even accounting for migration the birth rate in Suffolk is declining, and looks set to continue doing so. Sustaining our schools is key to keeping our villages and market towns alive and to curtailing their transition into retirement complexes for the middle classes who can afford to buy houses in them. Markets – whether for butchers buying pork or parents seeking school places – need enough buyers (or pupils, in the case of schools) for any of the competitors to survive. Suffolk grows quite a lot of pigs but not pupils. So why, then, has the DfE appeared to choose Suffolk as the test-bed for a new market in education provision, by approving so many new free schools in the county over the last few years ?\nThe news reported by Schoolsweek this weekend that the DfE has overturned – at least in the short-term – another new free school in Bury St Edmunds, is of course very welcome. (Sorry to labour the point but there are already enough – very good – schools in the area for the number of pupils available.) Also good news is the fact that the reversal happened because the County Council presented the DfE with a legal challenge. I presume that they did so primarily because the proposed free school, a middle school, threatened to undermine the final stages of the county’s transition into a two-tier system (primary and secondary schools instead of primary, middle and upper schools), rather than because of any new-found opposition to market models in public services.\nOver many years the Conservative administration in Suffolk has demonstrated an enthusiasm for market-led models in areas of public service (in areas such as care homes), and they have previously kept quiet as new free schools have popped up in market towns over the last few years. But they have argued long and fiercely for a transition to the two-tier school structure, on the grounds that it will raise GCSE attainment. (That said, given how much else has been going on in education it will of course be impossible to prove this either way). And perhaps they have finally got fed up with Suffolk’s children being used to test out government policy. There are, after all, no shortage of other areas where people want free schools and where there are pupils in need of school places.\nSuffolk now boasts five more secondary schools than it needs in areas all served by schools with ample spaces, all so the DfE could boast a new market in education. And they aren’t just any secondary schools, either: they include one – IES Breckland with a ‘for-profit’ provider which has already had to install a new headteacher due to being put in special measures, and three run by a trust – The Seckford Foundation – which might have been better off sticking to running private schools, which it seems better suited to. Is that a fair criticism? Well the Seckford Foundation’s Free Schools Trust (effectively a new academy chain, which runs Beccles, Saxmundham and Ixworth Free Schools), has already been subject to a DfE Warning Notice in relation to Beccles and Saxmundham (that must have hurt the DfE) as well as a rap over the knuckles by the Advertising Standards Authority. Stour Valley Community School, on the other hand, appears to be faring better, and things are improving in regard to Ofsted and staff turnover at IES Breckland. (Incidentally neither of these belong to academy chains – or at least not yet. Their independence makes them a bit vulnerable given the government’s stated aim that all schools – and it is still all schools – will be in academy chains by 2022, but that’s a whole other blog post).\nFree School rhetoric has it that competition raises standards, though how this would actually work in practice has never been satisfactorily explained. The results from Suffolk’s five free secondary schools (from DfE performance tables) so far suggest they have some way to go to get level with existing schools, let alone surpass them or drive up the county average. Stour Valley, at 52%, came closest to the Suffolk average of 54.5% for 5 A-Cs at GCSE including English and Maths in 2015. Beccles, Saxmundham and IES Breckland (Ixworth did not have a year 11 cohort last year) were all more than 10% behind the Suffolk average. It is important to state that the cohort in each of these schools was small, so a few pupils with very poor results could be pulling down the averages. But even so, they are poor results.\nSo where does that leave Suffolk’s pupils? Still off to market, but without much guarantee of success. Moreover, the financial impact of that market is felt across our existing schools as well as the new ones. Schools with fewer pupils than planned for have less money to spend, whether they are the new free schools or the existing schools which pupils would otherwise have gone to. And despite protestations that markets raise standards, there just isn’t the evidence out there to support the idea that any sort of schools can raise standards with a reduction in funds. Interestingly it’s Suffolk’s free schools which are taking the worst hit, by and large. Freedom of Information requests have revealed that whilst first choice applications to IES Breckland, Saxmundham and Stour Valley Community School have increased in the last year, applications to Beccles more than halved. And when it comes to actually offering places, more pupils have been offered places at the three Seckford Foundation schools (210 in total) than put them as first choice (177 in total), suggesting that a fair number of pupils are being sent to Free Schools rather than actually choosing to go to them. The really startling figure is that between them, the three Seckford schools anticipate filling less than 60% of their total year 7 places this September. That’s a very expensive experiment.\nSo far, then, you might wonder if market models work better for Suffolk’s pigs than for Suffolk’s pupils. The DfE has so far spent millions opening 5 new schools in Suffolk which are entirely surplus to requirements and which don’t produce better results. It approved then overturned (at least for the time being) another free school in Bury St Edmunds after local (good and outstanding) schools and the (Conservative) county council complained both forcefully and legally – even though the free school approval process is supposed to include consulting with local authorities and stakeholders. Given their aggressive – and rather chaotic – pursuit of ‘school growth’ it’s hard to avoid the conclusion that the DfE care more about growing a market in schools than they do about the quality of the education it delivers. Pigs get welfare standards, but schools don’t. As any financial advisor will tell you, one of the essential characteristics of market-based approaches – in any commodity – is that individual elements of it can fail. As it stands, some of the schools in this pupil market are surely heading for a crash, for both financial and educational reasons. This isn’t like buying bacon, it has a lasting impact on pupils’ life chances. Where, you might wonder, will we go from here?",

Faced with a lot of contradictory rhetoric from the various parties and candidates, it can be difficult to know what to believe.\nPredictably, there has been an anti-Labour story being pushed by the opposition parties and those media organizations who think it’s time for a change.\nTo judge Labour on its record, we must consider that record fairly, by looking at it as a whole. The long list of achievements over the last thirteen years that Labour can proudly claim has been too often overlooked by commentators.\nIt takes an effort to think back to the mid-1990s, to remember the state of public services at the end of the last period of Conservative rule. To remember how the Tories’ idealogically-driven removal of investment in public services had made those least able to help themselves worse off.\nBut that is the yardstick that we must use to measure what has been achieved since 1997. The Prime Minister in a speech yesterday made a point of listing these (and I forgive you if you don’t read the whole list – but see how long it is!):\n“You know, it’s been pretty relentless. Non-stop, on the go, never a moment’s let up, working round the clock. I don’t mean the last four weeks…. I mean the last 13 years. Because we’ve been busy.\nBusy changing lives. Busy changing communities. Busy changing this country for the better and forever.\nOn May the 2nd 1997 we set to work – and we’ve been working ever since. And just think the battles we have fought and won.\nThe minimum wage first enacted in 1997. First £3.60 an hour, now £5.80 an hour and now, in Labour’s manifesto, a minimum wage set to rise in the coming parliament not to £6 an hour – but to £7 an hour.\nBritain’s minimum wage is one of New Labour’s proudest achievements. But it’s not my achievement or Tony’s achievement – great as Tony was. No – it is not our achievement – it is your achievement. And it’s the achievement of the people of Britain.\nAnd it shows what good men and women of conviction can achieve when they work together for the common good.\nAnd I’ll tell you what else we’ve done together. On the first day of this campaign, I met a teacher. This isn’t one of those David Cameron type stories – I really did meet her, and she really was a teacher.\nAnd do you know what she said to me about the difference we had made? That back under the Tories she used to teach with a bucket beside her desk because she never knew when the classroom would leak and the kids would have to learn in their coats.\nBut now – after 3,700 schools have been rebuilt or refurbished with Labour – teachers know that we not only fixed the roof when the sun was shining but built hundreds of wholly new schools – and now it’s not old buckets in the classroom but new laptops, new whiteboards and new teaching assistants.\nThat’s not my achievement or Tony’s achievement. That’s your achievement and the achievement of every single person who has voted Labour and joined our fight for fairness.\nAnd do you know what else we’ve achieved by fighting?\n- the shortest NHS waiting times in history\n- three million more operations a year\n- over 44,000 more doctors\n- 90,000 more nurses\n- GPs open into the evenings and at weekends\n- free cancer prescriptions\n- a two-week maximum wait to see a cancer specialist\n- over 100 new hospitals\n- the Winter Fuel Allowance\n- free TV licences and free bus passes for pensioners\n- the Pension Credit\n- the New Deal for the Unemployed\n- full-time rights for part-time workers\n- the Social Chapter\n- record maternity pay\n- for the first time in history the right to paternity leave\n- the biggest programme of council house building for 20 years\n- the Disability Discrimination Act\n- the Racial and Religious Hatred act\n- the Equalities Act\n- the first black cabinet minister\n- the first Muslim minister\n- the first black woman minister to speak at the Commons despatch box\n- civil partnerships, gay adoption, the repeal of Section 28 and yes the right to book into a bed and breakfast\n- devolution: a Scottish Parliament, a Welsh Assembly and, yes, even a Mayor for London\n- the transformation of our great cities with bright new dawns for Leeds, Sheffield, Birmingham, Newcastle, Bristol, Glasgow, Edinburgh and Manchester\n- the Human Rights Act\n- crime down by a third\n- the hand gun ban\n- domestic violence cut by two thirds and rape convictions up by half\n- more police than ever on our streets\n- the world’s first ever Climate Change Act\n- beating the Kyoto emissions targets\n- the tripling of overseas aid\n- the cancelling of debt of the poorest countries\n- the ban on cluster bombs\n- peace in Northern Ireland\n- a Britain in Europe’s mainstream not in Europe’s slipstream\n- free swimming for kids\n- free museum entry\n- the right to roam\n- banning fox hunting\n- the Olympics for London\n- half a million children out of poverty\n- extended schools\n- 42,000 more teachers\n- the best ever exam results in schools\n- Education Maintenance Allowances\n- record numbers of students – and for the first time the majority of students are women\n- a doubling of apprenticeships\n- a Child Trust Fund for every newborn child\n- Sure Start children’s centres\n- free nursery places\n- and Child Tax Credits that this Labour government brought in and which a Tory government would cut because they just do not get it, never have, never will.\nSo when people say that politics can’t change anything – we reply it can, it has – and it will.\nAnd let us never forget that for the advancement of so many of these great causes we had to fight not just the Tories – but the Liberal Democrats too. And let’s never forget the most important lesson of these days – a lesson that is today more relevant than ever. And what is it?\nIt’s simple; when we fight, when we never give up on the fight, when we fight and fight and fight – we win.\nI am proud of what Labour has achieved in government; the manifesto contains an equally long list of things we want to do in the next parliament that will continue the fight against social injustice, lack of opportunity and the lack of social mobility, and keep fighting for fairness, sustainability and a more equal society for all.\nSo when you enter the polling station (and please, please do make time to vote, whatever your political opinions!) remember that list, and vote not just in your own interests, but in the interests of our society as a whole.

A bit of reality would be helpful here – literally raising the bar is what will help more pupils than raising the attainment of a few, and anything which helps achieve this from this review will be worth pursuing. But I digress – what I really hope will come out of this review is some way of understanding when our schools are performing well in more ways than simply counting GCSEs or EBacs. And of celebrating that, rather than being drawn in to the constant disparagement of our schools.\nHere’s hoping the Suffolk review really does lead to some thinking across the county about what our schools are for. Then we might be able to work out how to assess their achievement in more meaningful ways. Improvement will follow once we are sure what we are measuring and why.",
  "https_emmabishton_wordpress_com/https_emmabishton_wordpress_com_2016_11_09_some-schools-are-more-equal-than-others/content_19.html": "Anyone who follows the pronouncements of the Department for Education will know that it finds bald numbers – the results of abstract tests – more meaningful than assessments of progress, when determining whether pupils are getting what they need out of our education system. Anyone who spends much time talking to teachers and headteachers will also be aware that, on the whole, they seem to be of the opposite opinion – that written assessments of progress tell a fuller story about individuals than numerical scores do.\nQuantitative assessment has its place. I’ve been looking at some numbers produced by the National Union of Teachers and Association of Teachers and Lecturers, which tell a very different story than that offered by Theresa May and Justine Greening. The government says it is protecting ‘core schools funding’. The trouble is, their definition of ‘core school funding’ is very narrow. It doesn’t include funding which schools receive indirectly via local authorities, and which is set to be dramatically cut.\nNor does it take account of additional costs that schools now have to find from their ‘protected’ budgets, such as increased National Insurance contributions. When taken altogether, the government’s claims about school funding shift from lacking in candor to being misleading. The NUT/ATL have calculated exactly what those rising costs and indirect cuts are per year by 2020, in real terms, for each school in England, and there’s no happy ending. They have calculated that nationally, more than 9 out of 10 secondary schools will experience a cut in funds, averaging £365 per pupil.\nHere in Suffolk, the projected losses are less severe, because the calculations take account of the Fair Funding Formula, which the government is proposing to adopt. As Suffolk schools have for years received less funding per pupil than those in the country on average, that should be a good thing. And it would be a good thing were the government proposing to add resource to enable them to level up all the underfunded authorities, instead of sharing out the existing budget differently across all authorities. It doesn’t take a level 6 SATS pupil to work out that across the country, this method means many schools will lose out in order for some to benefit. Nor is it rocket science to realise that schools can’t recoup their losses simply by spending less on toilet roll or white boards. Even with the benefit of the funding formula in Suffolk, the projected funding deficit for Suffolk’s secondary schools alone is equivalent to more than 155 teachers.\nI hear heckling from the defenders of austerity: “Some schools have too much money, and anyway public services are wasteful”. Okay then: if that’s the case, how is it that some of our schools appear to be protected from the impact of these cuts and rising costs? As any reader of this blog may know by now, Suffolk has five secondary Free Schools additional to demand. These free schools are located in the leafier parts of our Tory shire; meanwhile, it is secondary schools in the most deprived parts of Suffolk (West Ipswich and Lowestoft) which are set to take the biggest hit. Here are some numbers, all derived from the data on the NUT/ATL calculator. Across Suffolk’s 45 secondary schools, by 2020:\n- The average impact of rising costs, funding cuts and the new funding formula, for the 29 academies ranges from 0-13%, average of 4.75%\n- The average impact of rising costs, funding cuts and the new funding formula for the 9 Local Authority schools ranges from 0 – 8%, with an average of 2.6%. (This figure is lower than the figure for academies because academies receive their share of the local authority grant directly, whereas for Local Authority schools the funds go to the local authority which is supposed to provide schools with services directly. That they don’t now, in these parts, is another story.)\n- The average impact of rising costs, funding cuts and new funding formula for the 5 Free Schools ranges from 0-2% with an average of just 0.6%. Free Schools are academies. Why then do they appear to be given preferential treatment?\n- Six of the seven schools with the highest projected cuts (each more than £300,000) are in the most deprived areas of Suffolk. That means that they already face significant challenges.\nFor example, Ormiston Denes Academy is the school calculated to take the biggest hit, with a projected cut of £620,230. Last year just 32% of pupils at Ormiston Denes achieved 5 x A*-C GCSEs including Maths and English. Yet a cut of this scale is equivalent to 16 teachers. This is not a recipe for improvement.\nFor the purposes of these numbers, I’ve accepted the assumptions of the NUT/ATL calculator. Detractors will doubtless query the formula, quibble over the assumptions, or suggest that other factors should be taken into account. Some may suggest a reason to account for the disparity in cuts between schools in the least deprived and the most deprived areas, and the apparent protection of Free Schools from cuts. But the outcome of these predicted cuts is pretty clear: these numbers cannot be made to tell a different story. Nor do they represent any kind of progress.",
  "https_emmabishton_wordpress_com/https_emmabishton_wordpress_com_category_musings-on-education_page_3/content_101.html": "When campaigning in the west part of South Suffolk (Sudbury and the villages to the south and north of it), I found that many people, without prompting, expressed their concerns about the local Schools Review. The review means that the current 3-tier system (primary, middle and high schools) will change to a 2-tier one, phasing out middle schools.\nThis change was instigated by the Conservative-led county council, and was first introduced in a consultation back in 2007. I was a school governor at a primary school in Great Cornard at the time, and it struck me – and many others – that the consultation was designed to demonstrate the basis for the council’s (already made) decision, not in fact to ask for people’s views to help come to a conclusion. More of an opinion poll than a consultation.\nThe council argued that better exam results in 2-tier systems made the case for changing from three tiers. To my mind they failed to explore other ways of addressing this apparent inequality or to account properly in their calculations for the different demographics across the county versus the systems in place.\nI don’t really want to focus on the merits of 2-tier rather than 3-tier systems here, or indeed on the county’s current plans for the actual re-organisation. However a significant consequence of the reorganisation is that parent groups have sprung up in both Clare and Stoke-by-Nayland to campaign against the proposed closure of the middle schools in these locations.\nThese campaigns were given a new momentum and focus by the Tory proposals to introduce ‘Free schools’, much vaunted in the election campaign and now included in the Queen’s Speech, and the groups are now campaigning to set up 11-16 High schools as ‘Free Schools’ in both Clare and Stoke by Nayland.\nThe concerns and activities of these parent groups have energised many others, including local businesses and former pupils. As a parent of children set to go to one of these middle schools myself, I entirely understand both the wish for children to attend schools which are as local as possible, and the sadness about losing popular and effective local middle schools. I also cannot fault the determination of these parents to champion their children’s education. However I profoundly disagree that the re-establishment of these schools as ‘Free’ high schools is the answer.\nAs I understand it, the points in favour of establishing high schools in these locations are:\n- they would be small\n- they would be local\n- they promote choice\n- they would set their own curriculum\n- they would capitalise on the energy of the parents involved\n- they would draw on other community resources (independent schools, businesses) and be somehow appreciably ‘different’ from other state schools\nAs I indicated during the campaign, I disagree, and here’s why, taking each of these points in turn and then adding a couple more :\nSmall: is this inherently good? Is big bad? I think as parents we all want to feel that our children are known in their school, and so very big schools seem impersonal, and rather scary. Personally, I’d be uncomfortable with a school of 2000. However, it doesn’t follow that schools of 500 are intrinsically good unless they are good schools for all the other reasons that make schools good. (To my mind the factors that make the most of teachers’ skills and therefore enable the best learning by pupils include clear leadership, high expectations, effective pastoral care and engagement by parents).\nThe most important thing to note about small schools, is that in the state system (i.e. without ‘pupil premium’ paid for by parents), smaller schools are VERY unlikely to have sufficient income to have enough teachers to provide a wide range of subjects and activities, within and outside of the curriculum. There are very definitely economies of scale. Added to which, a school of around 1500 can easily have extremely good pastoral care and therefore knowledge of individual pupils if it is organised in a way which promotes this (houses within schools, for example).\nLocal: Yes – I like the idea of children travelling as short a distance as possible to school, for pastoral and environmental reasons and so that as parents we can be part of the community surrounding the school. But in a rural area, local is only going to be local to a very small group of people.\nChoice: Yes, I can see that a wider range of schools promotes choice and that can be a good thing. But only if all the schools have a fair chance to succeed, and this cannot happen if funding is squeezed (see ‘disadvantages’ below). Furthermore, I have visited all the high schools in South Suffolk during the campaign, and found each one not only to be good but to be discernibly different, not just because they have different specialisms but also because all schools have their own character and identity. We already have choice, but it should also be remembered that choice is only available to those who have the capacity to exercise it. Therefore, what we must promote first and foremost is excellence in all our catchment schools.\nCurriculum: After much focus on the fact that the curriculum had become too focused on academic studies and left out vocational ones, we now have a curriculum for 14-16s which is broad enough to provide for a range of interests, abilities and different career paths. Even without consideration for vocational courses, smaller schools simply will not have enough revenue funding to provide for a wide enough range of individual subjects taught by specialists. For example, three separate science subjects may not be possible. That limits pupil choice, both at GCSE and beyond.\nParental energy: The commitment and energy of the parents seeking to set up free schools locally is extraordinary. However, what happens when this cohort of children have left the schools and their parents move on to other things? Will parents of new pupils be required to help? And what will happen if they do not have the skills?\nIt is already possible to be very involved in schools, as governors, as mentors, as volunteers. I’m sure the other schools in this area would love to harness the energy and commitment of all parents – it’s not necessary to start a new school to be involved in our children’s education.\nDrawing on community resources: This is always a good thing, and it is vital that every school be viewed as part of the fabric of the community, gaining from the community and giving back to it. Sometimes this can be in very obvious ways, and one of the things that impressed me in visiting Suffolk high or upper schools was the use of sports facilities by the community. However, like parental involvement, we don’t need new schools to be established in order to welcome involvement from organisations and businesses in our communities, we can do this now.\nThere are also a couple of other very big disadvantages to the setting up of free schools:\nMoney: Unless there is in fact demand for places that are not already provided for by existing schools, the establishment of new ‘free schools’ would take pupils, and therefore funding, away from existing provision. This would disadvantage those schools and is simply not tolerable. Because of the Schools Organisation Review, there is a perception that this will not happen in Suffolk. However, if a school has a defined catchment now and another school is set up within that catchment, the existing school will lose pupils even though the changes made bringing in the 2-tier system increase the number of year-groups taught. The numbers of pupils gained do not make up for those lost to the new school.\nArguments put forward so far have seemed to me to focus on capital costs only, and of course these are a concern. However, revenue funding is what secures the school’s capacity to help pupils learn, and two competing schools in one catchment means less revenue funding for each school. Revenue funding includes paying for teachers, teaching assistants, pastoral care, heating bills and maintaining sports facilities. And that’s before other issues are considered, such as whether the county council will provide free bus transport for both existing schools and new free schools in an area.\nStandards: Where are the guarantees with Free schools that the quality of education sought will actually be provided? And what would happen to a Free school, and to the pupils in that school, if it failed to deliver?\nPerceptions of the existing schools: Schools, as with all public institutions, can lose ‘stakeholder’ trust and gain negative reputations faster than they can gain positive ones. Negativity is self-perpetuating. The act of promoting new schools as those that will meet parental expectations suggests (inadvertently or otherwise) that existing schools fail to do this. Recovery from this position is hard for the schools, for the pupils at those schools, and for the community in which those schools are based.\nTo sum up\nWhilst the suggestion to establish new schools can be made quickly, and sounds on the face of it a fantastic opportunity, it would take a very long time to undo the damage caused by setting them up. The idea is a bad one unless there is either additional funding around or increased demand for places; neither of these applies in South Suffolk, and I hope this post will help outline the reasons why I believe this.\nOur children don’t (or only rarely do) choose their schools, parents do. And despite the best of intentions, parents may in fact limit the choices available to all children in the area by setting up schools which disadvantage other schools and their pupils, all without giving any guarantee that the new schools will in fact offer what they would want.\nEstablishing new ‘free schools’ would disadvantage other schools and therefore other children. Our children’s futures cannot be secured in isolation from the system which our community needs to be built on. If the energy of the parents wanting closer involvement in their children’s schools could be harnessed in other ways, all our children would benefit.",
  "https_emmabishton_wordpress_com/https_emmabishton_wordpress_com_2016_01_29_how-much-are-the-arts-worth/content_59.html": "The Department for Education has been consulting on proposals to extend the reach of the EBacc and how it is used to measure school performance. Below is my response.\nDear Consultation team\nI am writing in response to the consultation on the implementation of the English Baccalaureate – the proposal that at least 90% of pupils enter EBacc subjects. My response is to question 1: the factors that should be taken into account in making decisions about which pupils should not be entered for the EBacc.\nMy son is in year 9, and in the middle of choosing his GCSE options. His school (which is a good school) held an options evening for pupils and parents this week at which school leaders and teachers stressed how important it is for pupils to choose subjects which interest them, which do not limit their choices post 16, and which provide a balance of skills for life. Taking all this on board, my son is choosing two creative arts subjects. His reasoning is sound: he’s good at them, and (at the moment at least) he wants to pursue a career in music teaching.\nMy son is lucky: he can choose 10 GCSEs. So he is also choosing options which make up the EBacc. He is choosing these subjects because they suit him, they provide a balance of skills for his life, and ensure that he keeps his options post 16 open. His school could have taken a different tack, and required all pupils to choose the EBacc. They could, for example, insist that he take two humanities subjects in order to maximise the likelihood that he achieves the EBacc. But if they had done that they would be failing in their duty as a comprehensive school to ensure that each child’s needs, abilities and future career paths are considered in the choices they make.\nPupils who take 8 GCSEs (the national average) are less lucky. They are likely to find that EBacc ‘options’ alone can account for 7 GCSEs, leaving only one they can actually choose (which of course will then be subject to school timetabling issues). So for such pupils – regardless of their future career intentions or their interests or abilities, their ‘options’ at GCSE may be limited by a measure the school needs them to take in order to satisfy government reporting requirements, but which may have little bearing on their own needs and aspirations. And what if their aspiration is to join the 1.7 million people working in the creative arts in the UK?\nI am not a teacher, but as a singer I am involved with choirs in my local primary school. Next week I am looking forward to going with our school choirs to Young Voices at the O2 – a celebration of singing shared by 6000 children, and an occasion I know – from previous experience – that our young choir members will remember for years to come. Experiences like Young Voices arise because of the (largely voluntary) efforts of primary teachers prepared to go the extra mile to foster an interest in music and the arts. Yet their efforts are effectively wasted if secondary schools are forced to reduce time spent on the arts, and when the clear message given to pupils by government is that GCSEs in arts subjects are somehow ‘lesser qualifications’, as evidenced by their exclusion from the EBacc. These concerns are not unfounded – DfE evidence shows that since the introduction of the EBacc there has been a 14% reduction in the uptake of arts subjects at GCSE (figures from the Cultural Learning Alliance), and a 10% reduction (DfE figures) in the number of hours spent on the arts in secondary schools. It is easy to see how a reduction in the perceived value of arts subjects at GCSE leads to the dropping of arts subjects at A’level. That in turn leads to the situation seen for example at Queen Elizabeth grammar school in Faversham, which reported in November last year that it has been forced to drop A’ levels in music and drama (amongst other subjects) as they have become too expensive to run.\nThose primary school teachers staying late to take choir know that the arts are not just for fun. Engagement in the creative arts provides young people with non-judgemental opportunities for self-expression which – as the evidence shows – contribute strongly to emotional and psychological wellbeing. Wellbeing, of course, is a key driver of attainment. None of this would be a surprise to the UK’s independent schools, whose focus on the creative arts (and sport) is often a key part of their identity, and attractive to prospective parents. But those independent schools don’t need to be measured against the EBacc at all, let alone in the six different ways government are proposing to use it to measure state school performance. Concentrating arts provision in private schools which only 7% of pupils attend will not help the government realise its ambition for increased social mobility.\nReducing interest in the arts has significant economic risks too. Nowhere is that more obvious than here in East Anglia, where Suffolk and Norfolk county councils are busy promoting ‘cultural tourism’ to maximise the tourism income from the internationally-renowned venues and festivals that are well established in the region (in line with George Osborne’s recommendation in the 2015 Spending Review that the arts are …“one of the best investments the UK can make”). But it is hard to see how children who have not been inspired and engaged in the creative arts will wish to become the cultural tourists of the future.\nAs a parent, I don’t need to use arbitrary accountability measures such as the EBacc to make informed judgements about the quality of my children’s education. Nor do I need the EBacc to help my children determine what their choices should be at GCSE, as good schools should prioritise the needs of pupils above reporting requirements. I appreciate that the EBacc promotes the study of modern languages and humanities, which is positive – for those pupils suited to these subjects. But balance is what is needed, across all subjects. The creative arts are also serious subjects, studied academically. Driving schools to enter 90% of pupils in the EBacc, rather than focusing on choices that reflect individual needs fails not only those pupils whose future career may lie in the creative arts, but also those pupils who want and need a balance of subjects at GCSE, and those pupils whose abilities do not suit academic study. Given this, I fail to see how the EBacc can provide an effective means of raising standards, of increasing social mobility or of narrowing inequalities. Instead it risks distracting schools, forcing them to focus on league tables at the expense of individualised teaching. It is therefore impossible to see how the EBacc will actually help government to realise its educational ambitions.\nThe end result – and the evidence as cited above highlights the very real risk of this– is that KS4 and KS5 education in the creative arts will be available only to a minority of children at independent schools which are not constrained by the need to report against meaningless accountability measures. That is not in the interests of my children, or anyone else’s. I urge you to reconsider these proposals.\nyours sincerely\nEmma Bishton",

  "https_emmabishton_wordpress_com/https_emmabishton_wordpress_com_tag_curriculum/content_55.html": "In his ongoing quest to diminish the influence of educational experts on education, Michael Gove proposed a new curriculum for key stages 1,2 and 3, which was out to consultation during March and April. The proposals were roundly criticised for a number of reasons, by people well-placed to do so. The proposals for history caught the attention of people, like myself, who have an interest in education but are not experts, perhaps because they seem to value teaching ‘what/when‘ over ‘why’. What has received less coverage is that Mr Gove appears to be using these proposals to undermine the scientific consensus on climate change, pandering to the sceptics in his party.\nIn the proposed curriculum, children are required to learn about weather, biodiversity, habitats and electricity – all in themselves necessary. However, reading the proposed programmes of study one could be forgiven for assuming that we live in a static world – where resources are stable and infinite and where there is no challenge to our daily way of life. But this isn’t the case, and it’s most certainly not the case for the children whose learning will be based on this new curriculum: they are the generation who will need to adapt to, and mitigate the impacts of, climate change and peak oil. In the current curriculum there are requirements to study the interactions between populations and the environment (e.g. KS3 geography) and sustainable practices (e.g. KS3 citizenship) but in the new proposals there is little other than a reference to the ‘efficacy of recycling’ (in KS3 chemistry).\nThe vital discussion about how we adapt to live in – not off – our environment can’t just be left to the few teachers with the interest, timetable freedoms and resources to do so, especially when there is so little freedom and flexibility for individual teachers.\nOur Transition group (Transition Nayland) submitted a response to the Department of Education as part of the consultation on these curriculum proposals. You might be forgiven for wondering why we bothered, given the extraordinary intransigence of the DfE, which appears never to engage in dialogue even during ‘consultation’. But here’s why: we can’t afford not to. Our children need to learn how to adapt, and they in turn will need to teach successive generations to do the same.\nOur principal objection is that the proposed curriculum does not meet the essential overarching criterion, as set out in legislation (Education Act 2002), which ‘prepares pupils at school for the opportunities, responsibilities and experiences of later life’. This is because they will not leave school equipped as outlined in the science and geography curricula: to understand ‘the uses and implications of science, today and for the future’ or ‘how…humans interact with the physical world and how this changes over time’. Crucially, they will not have been required to consider the rights and responsibilities of being a global citizen in today’s world. I fear that the efforts of organisations like Transition groups will seem lost for a generation if there is no central narrative, no underpinning principles learnt from school and carried forward for life.\nPerhaps Mr Gove is out of touch on this issue – and even out of touch with several in his own party. Last Thursday, the Green Party fielded more candidates than ever before in the county elections, and 22 of them got elected. Some will say that the Greens are just a party of protest for those on the Left, or somewhere else for disaffected LibDems to go, and there may be some truth in both points. But fundamentally the Greens propose ways of adapting how we live in our changing world – a message which, given the scale of the challenge, can’t be ignored by any political party (except UKIP, of course, who to date have succeeded in just ignoring it). Getting the curriculum right will build public understanding, and create a generation of scientists equipped to find and implement solutions that will create a more sustainable future.\nSo far Transition Nayland has had just the standard ‘Thank you for your response – we’re very busy’ from the DfE. We’ll report any proper response (or even better, any changes that result) on our Transition Nayland website.",
  "https_emmabishton_wordpress_com/https_emmabishton_wordpress_com_page_5/content_91.html": "Last week my brother turned 50. Not very remarkable, you might think. Except that he is severely disabled with Down’s Syndrome and has some tricky health issues. Not that long ago it would have been considered remarkable for someone in his situation to live well into their forties – and a century ago life expectancy for someone with Down Syndrome was just 12.\nAlso last week I signed a petition about a severely learning disabled man from Suffolk who has had a stroke, and who was occupying a hospital bed he no longer needed because the local health and social care authorities have not agreed which of them should fund his package of care. His case, sadly, is not unusual. As happens so often, the issue here was whether the man needed ‘nursing’ or ‘social’ care. To most of us this is an abstract and rather meaningless distinction, not least since social care can include carrying out essential health-related tasks which most of us don’t have to do for ourselves, let alone for someone else (injecting insulin, for example). But providing care costs money, both health and social care organisations need to make financial savings, so each wants the other to pay. As the distinction between nursing and social care is often finely drawn even for the professionals, such debates are now protracted and commonplace. The person who needs the care – and their family – are left waiting whilst care is broken down into a series of tasks and an associated set of costs.\nI don’t believe the decision-makers in these or any other health and social care organisations lack empathy or understanding (even though it might seem that way at times). They are required to make objective decisions in the interests of fairness, and to use public resources effectively, and that is what they are seeking to do. But they are hamstrung by inadequate resources, as we don’t place enough value on care work to pay for the levels of care we would ourselves wish to receive.\nCare costs, there is simply no way round this. If we need someone to help us get out of bed in the morning, and (for whatever reason) we don’t have family members who can help us do that, then that carer needs paying. (And even so, many carers who help people to live are not themselves earning a living wage, nor do they often have time to provide companionship and social support to the people they care for.) As we constantly hear in any debates about the future of healthcare, we live in an ageing society. For people with learning disabilities that means they will often outlive their family carers – or that their physical care needs will become impossible for family carers to deliver. And, due to the complex nature of their disabilities, that care may be complicated to plan and deliver. But that doesn’t mean they should be subjected to abstract debates about the nature of care. Perpetuating the ongoing division between nursing and social care just makes work for the organisations involved, wastes hospital beds, and leaves the cared-for person – and their family – adrift in the system. People who need care are entitled to it, whatever it is called. It’s time we gave them the dignity of paying for it.",
  "https_emmabishton_wordpress_com/https_emmabishton_wordpress_com_category_health/content_21.html": "Spoiler alert: there’s no humour in this post.\nThis morning, my eleven-year old daughter was in tears as she prepared to go to school (which has never happened before). Like many year 6 children she is anxious to do her best, and frightened of being made to repeat the tests (a peculiar proposal for the government to put forward if the tests really are about measuring the system not the pupils, as Nick Gibb tried to suggest last week). She is at a great school, with encouraging and experienced teachers who, I am very confident, will do their utmost to make the week as relaxed as possible. But that won’t take away the essential problem – that she, her friends and her teachers are being used by government as pawns to test the UK system against a few select international competitors. Which isn’t a very healthy position for any of the individuals concerned.\nThere is, of course, a big difference between feeling temporarily stressed and having a diagnosed mental health problem, but the two can be related, and it made me think about the potential for schools (as agents for education policy and independently of it) to contribute both positively and negatively to children’s mental health and wellbeing.\nOver the last five years, there has been a significant increase in the numbers of children and adolescents with mental health problems, and a consequent increase in referrals to specialist services, resulting in frustration and anxiety for young people and their parents who need help at the point of referral, not several months down the line. (For more information see for example this report by Centre Forum.) To try and cope with the rising demand on Child & Mental Health Services (CAMHS), government identified £1.25 billion for ‘transforming’ CAMHS services so that by 2020 they are more accessible, more responsive and better able to cope with rising demand.\nThat might sound like a lot of money, but once you spread the money over five years and then start costing out services across the country, it’s still going to be a huge challenge for local services to meet the rising need. And part of that rise is the government’s own fault.\nJust as you don’t have search far for a story about a young person struggling to access the counselling or other mental health help they need, you don’t have to look far for stories about the emotional and psychological impact on pupils of the government’s policies for increasing school test results. Here’s one, for example, on the Let Our Kids be Kids site.\nThe Centre Forum report suggests that 3 pupils in every class need mental health services or at the very least some additional support. So in a joined-up system you might think that schools would be supported to link up with local mental health services (many schools in the past have had CAMHS workers embedded in schools which has worked well for all concerned), or would have counselling provision that can link up with those services. You might also expect that local authorities or academy trusts would be required to monitor and check that such support is in place. But no. Some schools have pupil wellbeing firmly on their agenda, provide support in-house and make such links as far as is possible given the constraints on services (I’m pleased to say my son’s school, Thomas Gainsborough, held a parents information event recently following on from PSHE days on emotional wellbeing and mental health). But other schools don’t, because they are too fearful of failing to comply with the government requirement that test results go up. And fear is not a positive motivator.\nSchools with results above the required level have a bit of breathing space (though I grant you, it may not feel like it). Schools with falling results – or even results which stay fairly constant – have no room whatsoever. And the consequence? Often, sadly, a relentless focus on tests and testing at the exclusion of creative arts, sporting activities – and crucially, support services for pupils who are struggling. And the academy system just makes this worse. The lack of accountability of academies to parents and local authorities increases the ‘freedom’ of academies to impose actions which are not supported by parents, not good for pupil’s emotional or psychological wellbeing, and even not likely to improve outcomes (i.e. don’t follow the evidence-base). And sadly there are academies and academy chains out there that seem hell-bent on driving through mechanistic measures to improve results without consideration of the impact on pupil wellbeing or of the ramifications of losing parent support for the school’s actions. An example I heard recently really brought this home.\nA couple of weeks ago I attended a campaign meeting about the Education White Paper, and heard a parent speak with clarity and passion about changes imposed in her daughters (secondary) school since a recent downturn in GCSE exam results. Whilst still officially a ‘Good with outstanding features’ school (that is, it hasn’t had an Ofsted visit since results went down), the school now appears to be in panic mode, and its actions don’t, at least on the face of it, appear likely to improve either the exam results or the wellbeing of pupils. It has instigated some very victorian practices such as making all year groups (yes even the 15 year olds) line up before school, and withdrawing the morning break. Another of the ‘solutions’ it has put in place is to publish pupils’ test results for each year group. So exams are no longer used to inform pupils, parents and teachers of how pupils are doing (nothing new in that, after all), but to rank pupils – and then to display that information for anyone in school to see. When challenged, the school explained that this practice was used in another academy in the same chain. They either did not or could not explain why it was supposed to be helpful in that original school, or how they expected it to work in one with a significantly more diverse intake.\nI’m aware that pupils often know quite a bit about how they perform relative to their peers. But that is not at all the same as having that information bandied about publicly for all outside their immediate peer group to see – and potentially to misuse. And how public shaming (which is what it can amount to for some) is supposed to be motivational is beyond me. Instead, it’s all too easy for pupils to lose self-esteem and motivation – as the parent I heard testified, with the example of another pupil who has now left the school.\nAll this, whilst seeming unlikely to have a positive impact on exam results, is very likely to create demand for child and adolescent mental health services. An increasing emphasis on a school culture based on stick and no carrot, combined with a lack of time for PHSE and a failure to value constructive relationships with parents, almost certainly goes against what most schools would be wanting to achieve if they really had the freedom to act in their pupil’s best interests.\nThere is plenty of evidence linking increased pupil wellbeing to educational attainment (or in other words better exam results). And there’s no shortage of best practice about how to support schools to recognise young people in need of help and liaise effectively with the right services. So you might expect the government, faced with rising demand for CAMHS services, to take the opportunity in the CAMHS transformation funding to ensure that local authorities (which are responsible for these services at school level) are both required and resourced to put such services in our schools. But instead they have cut funding to local authorities. And I notice that wellbeing of young people doesn’t feature in the governments (very short) list of things that local authorities will remain responsible for if their White Paper gets through parliament.\nIt is tempting to accuse the government of caring only about exam results and not about the wellbeing of the pupils concerned – that is, to have no capacity or interest in assessing the impact of the processes used to achieve that goal on pupils’ emotional and psychological health. But it could be more accident than design. Either way, the government’s Department for Education appears entirely disconnected from the Department of Health. As a consequence schools in general are deprived of the support and services they need to respond to the needs of their pupils, and schools that are paralysed by the fear of exam failure are reduced to implementing draconian measures in the hope of shaming pupils to better results – and not even then held accountable for these actions to parents. Not only is all this bad for young people and their families, it will cost us all more in the long term.",

One month before working parents of 3-4 year olds (those who meet the minimum earnings threshold to qualify) will apparently be accessing 30 hours of ‘free’ childcare a week during term-time. Sounds good, doesn’t it! Ah, but look again. It’s another of those chimeras offered by the Government that Likes to Say Yes (but really means No). With the net result that it isn’t looking very likely that many of those 3-4 years will be taking up 30 hours free childcare anytime soon. According to Suffolk Infolink, for example, there are only three providers (two school nurseries and one childminder) as of today registered to provide the 30 hours (out of a total of nearly 500 childcare providers in Suffolk who could be signing up to deliver it). Not exactly a wide choice of handy providers for working parents to choose from come September.\nThe Department of Education wants to promote childcare. For good reason: good early years support and play can help young children to build good foundations in social skills, confidence, communication and so on before they get to school, heading off educational inequality. There’s plenty of evidence to this effect (though it’s been studiously ignored by government and local authorities when it comes to continuing the funding for Children’s Centres, of course). And childcare is expensive for working parents, so all in all it sounds a terrific idea.\nYou can hear the “but” coming…\nTo start with, there are problems with the policy itself. The ‘free’ childcare is only available to working parents who have enough income (but not too much, which is at least something). Now it’s not a high threshold (to qualify parents have to earn the equivalent of 16 hours per week at minimum wage), but that does mean that many of the children who could most benefit, whose parents are out of work or too randomly employed to qualify, aren’t actually eligible for free care. I could go on. The message ‘you have to be the right sort of parent to qualify for our offer’ couldn’t be clearer.\nThe government is of course at liberty to make bad policy decisions. But it isn’t at liberty to expect small businesses, self-employed individuals and voluntary sector organisations to pay for them. Which is exactly what seems to be happening.\nI became aware of this issue during the election campaign, when as a local Labour candidate I was contacted by local childcare providers who have set up a national campaign group called Champagne Nurseries on Lemonade Funding (CNLF). (And if only Labour had got in, childcare would be funded, with the funds being paid directly to providers so they could budget and plan properly. But I digress.) CNLF are rightly angry at being forced to pay for government policy, and even angrier at the mis-selling of the childcare as ‘free’. Many childcare providers are private nurseries, the kind of local enterprise that the Tory government is usually so keen on. But bizarrely, it looks as if government expects the private sector, along with not-for-profit nurseries (both types often providing longer days year-round to meet the needs of working parents), to take the biggest hit.\nChildcare doesn’t come cheap: it needs staff (never mind rent, electricity, food etc). Preferably experienced and qualified early years staff, in sufficient quantities that they can do more than simply feed, toilet and keep the children safe. In preparation for the 30 hours ‘free’ childcare, the DfE (with assistance from Deloitte) did a survey of childcare providers, their staffing ratios and cost, and found that (not surprisingly) on average providers use higher staff-ratios than the statutory minimum. (The word ‘minimum’ is used for a reason. Surely it is no coincidence that 85% of childcare providers have good or outstanding Ofsted ratings, yet average staff ratios are well above the statutory minimum?) And the DfE’s conclusion, of course, was not that parents and providers clearly prefer a staff:child ratio that enables staff to do more than make sure the children stay safe. No, the DfE decided that – despite the real-terms cuts in funding the National Audit Office had previously pointed to them – it must be possible for providers to make savings and provide childcare more cheaply. The upshot? Providers are being paid less than it costs to provide care. Oh and they’re not allowed to pass the shortfall on to parents. So how might providers respond? One way, apparently, is to put staff on ‘more flexible’ contracts. (The kind of contract that could of course render them ineligible for the free childcare if they have young children of their own!)\nThe government, of course, has passed the buck to local authorities to sort out. But they are not equipped to do so. A quick glance at the Facebook page for the CNLF group shows you the kind of advice local authority advisors have been meting out to providers. It ranges from ‘ask staff to work voluntarily until the numbers build up’, ‘pay all the staff same regardless of (relevant and required) qualifications’ to ‘put out a bucket for donations’ to ‘take in the parents’ ironing to do whilst staff aren’t busy’. You get the picture. Advisors have been tasked to do the government’s dirty work implementing an un-funded policy, all the while having to pretend it’s Christmas for parents. Because the government aren’t so much providing free childcare as a free-for-all and a race to the bottom in the childcare market. You’ve got to wonder what kind of childcare MPs and councillors would choose for their own children: nurseries that open the hours the parents want, with qualified and motivated staff who work regular hours and can get to know their children, or providers open when they can afford to be, with minimum staffing levels and a donation bucket to pay for paintbrushes.

  "https_emmabishton_wordpress_com/https_emmabishton_wordpress_com_category_uncategorized/content_18.html": "I’m a core member of the parent campaign group Rescue our Schools. We campaign for changes in our education system so that our children can be equipped with the skills and attributes necessary for life in the 21st century, and their schools and teachers have the resources and respect required for this to happen. We have a six-point manifesto for change in our education system, and I spent a couple of days this week reviewing just how the Department for Education has fared against these in the last year. Caution: it makes for unhappy reading. But it is also a call to action. 2019 is the year we must see positive change for our schools, our children and our future.\n- Invest in all our futures\nRequires improvement. The Department began the year with a new Education Secretary, Damian Hinds. Unlike his predecessor, Justine Greening, he came as a supporter of grammar schools (presumably one of the reasons he was appointed). Other than occasional announcements like the recent ones that children should climb trees (there’s an idea we’d never have thought of!) and that schools should reduce single-use plastics (they have, after all, nothing else to do), little else has changed. Education policy continues to be dominated by three things: a refusal to acknowledge that schools and early years settings need more funding to do the job asked of them, the desire to push testing to extremes and in doing so prioritise the able over the less able, and the continued marketisation of schools achieved by the ongoing push of schools away from local authorities and into academy chains. The recruitment and retention of staffing in schools, meanwhile, remains at crisis point.\nOur Christmas message in 2017 focused on funding and the rising pressures on schools seeking to accommodate the increase in cost pressures affecting our schools. How depressing, then, to still be leading on this a year later. And this despite the unprecedented sight, in September, of 2000 headteachers protesting ‘relentlessly reasonably’ on Whitehall, followed in October by a campaign organised by our sister campaign group Save our Schools in which pupils directly addressed MPs in parliament. After months of campaigning there was, in December, one important and welcome announcement: an increase in high needs funding for children with special educational needs and disabilities. This will help some children, but it isn’t enough. And it doesn’t begin to address the core funding problems facing schools across the country, many of which are having to ask parents to fund pencils and paper (the kind of thing Philip Hammond presumably had in mind when he talked about schools needing those ‘little extras’!).\n2. Promote inclusive education for all\nFail. Changes to funding for local authorities, combined with funding pressures on school budgets, have made it extremely difficult for schools to meet the needs of children with special education needs – a situation which not only discriminates against children with additional needs and their families; it potentially harms all children. Yet the level of need is clear; as of this year, 14.6% of pupils are on the SEN register. They are failed not only by inadequate levels of support (cost pressures reducing access to teaching assistants, for example), but also by the increased focus on exams and testing. Our own survey about the new GCSEs highlighted the punitive and emotionally devastating impact of the new exam regime for pupils with special educational needs such as autism. Meanwhile some parents are having to crowd-fund legal action in order to secure the required specialist support for their children from local authorities. The playing field is now so far from level that it is ceasing to offer many children an opportunity to play at all.\n3. Promote education over exam factories\nHard to know where to start, in the year that pupils sat the new GCSEs and A levels which are based almost exclusively on exams designed to favour those with good memories and high literacy skills, and in which primary schools started piloting baseline testing in reception. RoS had a busy summer surveying parents and teachers about the impact of the new GCSEs, and in ongoing campaigning with fellow organisations as part of More than a Score, seeking to reform SATs and end the link between test results and school accountability. (Have a look at this video about the #BigSATsSitIn – you can also sample the tests for yourself!) The impact of testing on pupil wellbeing has been questioned over and over again, in a year which also saw independent evidence of the rise of mental ill-health and poor emotional wellbeing in children and young people. RoS’ petition to address this was endorsed by Natasha Devon, former government mental health champion, amongst others. As the year drew to a close, the former head of the civil service added his voice to those concerned about the long-term impact on our children’s wellbeing. We will continue to campaign loudly and vigorously on this in 2019.\n4. Develop Creativity in all its forms\nAnother fail. Not surprisingly, given the pressure on resources and the perpetual drive from ministers to prioritise testing in traditional academic subjects (in SATs and by use of the Ebacc) over giving pupils a broad educational experience. Over the year, we have been able to highlight on social media work done in some of the most creative – and successful – schools bucking the trend, both in terms of access to arts subjects and activities, and creative approaches to teaching and learning overall.\nThe UK has traditionally excelled in the creative industries. Yet 2018 saw another year-on-year reduction in access to arts subjects throughout the curriculum, in GCSE entries for subjects such as music, drama, art, design technology and more, and consequently in employment of teachers in these subjects. In 2019 we need your help to promote this message all the more, before the situation becomes irreversible.\n5. Let expert evidence inform policy\nNo progress. There are many experts. There are many policy makers. But the one rarely seems to inform the other, except occasionally when referring to evidence that supports ideas currently in fashion in the DfE (those that support the use of synthetic phonics, for example).\nOne of the areas in which the evidence is overwhelming clear is that grammar schools do not improve attainment overall. Yet this year we have seen funding prioritised to expand grammar schools on the grounds that these schools will justify the increase in funding by widening access to pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds. Meanwhile, organisations such as the Education Policy Institute have published more evidence on the attainment gap for pupils on free school meals, and NHS research documented an increase in mental ill-health in young people While the government prioritises resources on pursuing a grammar school agenda not backed up by evidence, some schools are having to team up with local charities to provide breakfast clubs for children in poverty.\n6. Ensure local accountability for all schools\nAgain, there have been no shortage of concerns and failures in Multi Academy Chains, and both the Parliamentary Accounts Committee and the Education Select Committee have been increasingly critical of the problems with the Academies model. Stories range from the failure of a whole MAT, the rise of fixed-term exclusions, prescriptive teaching, high levels of executive pay, and significant concerns about misuse of funds. Thanks to BBC’s Panorama programme, the pitfalls of the Multi Academy Trust model and its associated lack of oversight are now much better understood. We will continue to provide a platform on social media for local campaigns fighting forced academisation. But we also must acknowledge that local authorities are now considerably under-resourced to support schools, even where those schools remain in LEA control.\nAs the new year approaches, so does a new Ofsted accountability framework The headlines suggest they want to change the current focus on data, involve teachers and assess the breadth and substance of the curriculum in schools. We at RoS are parents – we understand the value of meaningful, robust and consistent assessment of how schools are meeting our children’s needs, and want to be sure our teachers and school leaders are appropriately supported. But changing the framework alone doesn’t give schools the resources, creative freedom and evidence they need to develop the education Ofsted claims to want to evaluate. Moreover there are worrying signs that the inspectorate may be moving towards directing schools ‘how‘ to teach – with an emphasis on memorising rather than acquisition of skills. Such a narrow view of education would only let children down and, if introduced, must be emphatically resisted. As we have done with previous consultations, RoS will be asking for your thoughts to inform our response when the consultation on the new framework is published in early 2019.\nOverall Assessment\nThroughout the year, the Department for Education has plunged deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole, in a constant bid to find its own alternate reality universe in which school budgets really are at a record high and standards really have been raised equitably with a meaningful impact on pupils’ futures. Whilst it has being doing this, the UK Statistics Authority has found cause to write to the DfE no fewer than FOUR times in 2018 about misleading use of education statistics. With all government stagnating due to Brexit, the DfE appears to find its own version of the Mad Hatters tea party quite a comforting place to be. But schools, pupils and parents do not.\nOur Rescue our Schools message for 2019 is clear: the children and young people in school now cannot afford to wait another year for the government to wake up to its own responsibilities. We must join together, and act.",
  "https_emmabishton_wordpress_com/https_emmabishton_wordpress_com_tag_music/content_80.html": "I’ve just replied to the DfE consultation on the use of the Educational Services Grant (ESG), which the DfE wish to cut substantially. This grant is used to help fund a range of education-related services including pupil welfare, sports and music services. Local authorities don’t just use this grant to fund these services, they fund them from revenue budgets also. For music, the really damaging statement is this:\nOur expectation is that music services should now be funded through music education hubs (which can cover one or more local authority areas) and from school budgets, not from the ESG.\nDfE funding to music hubs (via the Arts Council) has already reduced. So where then should music hubs (which primarily provide services to schools) be getting their funds from? There’s no Big Society Donor out there that I can see, wanting to pay for millions of children to experience music-making. So this statement effectively legitimises local authorities from withdrawing all funds from music services, whether they are paid for through the ESG or any other funding stream. the ISM are leading a campaign: Protect Music Education and have led the charge for responses to the DfE consultation and helpfully provided a template response. Here’s what I sent: Dear Ms Barbour, I am responding to the Department for Education’s (DfE) consultation titled Savings to the Education Services Grant 2015-16 recommending that local authorities stop funding music services. The consultation includes the expectation that local authorities stop funding music services, stating “Our expectation is that music services should now be funded through music education hubs (which can cover one or more local authority areas) and from school budgets, not from the ESG”. I am asking for the Department for Education (DfE) to withdraw this expectation and instead recommend that local authorities continue to fund their music services. My response is solely concerned with the recommendations for funding music education and addresses questions 4 a, b and c.\nConsultation Question 4a Are there any reasons why local authority expenditure on central support services could not be significantly reduced, if not stopped altogether? Please give details below. Yes. National Plan The National Plan for Music Education sets out a vision for music education in England which depends on the combination of financial support of the Department for Education, schools and parents, and local authorities. In the foreword to this plan, this complex funding structure was recognised as was the interdependence between the different elements of the music education sector. The Department for Education has made public commitments to access to music specialists, saying ‘it is important that music education of high quality is available to as many [children] as possible: it must not become the preserve of those children whose families can afford to pay for music tuition. While music touches the lives of all young people, the disadvantaged can benefit most.’ This statement is particularly pertinent given recent reports from Ofsted that white working class children are achieving the lowest outcomes. Without music hubs providing services such as First Access class instrumental lessons (as they do in my LA, Suffolk), these children are significantly less likely to encounter opportunities for making music and its associated benefits if music hubs are not resourced to work in schools. The LA is in a position to mandate music hubs to direct use of LA funds to support disadvantaged children in particular. It should be encouraged to do so, not least because of the cognitive, emotional and social benefits that children derive from participating in music activities. (These benefits include developing skills which workplaces require, such as collaboration). The DfE, in reviewing the use of the ESG, could use this as an opportunity to direct LAs about their responsibilities in this area instead of appearing to legitimise withdrawal of services.\nThe Henley report recognised that primary schools teacher training does not equip trainee and NQT teachers with the skills and confidence to deliver on the music curriculum. And the vast majority of state schools have neither the expertise nor the specialist resources to deliver programmes like First Access in-house. The key to ensuring the quality and sustainability of musical opportunities for children is to ensure the continuation of national, local, school and parental funding for music education hubs which not only provide direct services but also support the school teaching staff.Funding National funding for music education hubs distributed via the Arts Council is already reducing from a high of £82.5 million in 2010-11 to just £58 million in 2014-15. If local authority funding is also lost, access to musical tuition and a good music education will become the preserve of a few (the most well-off) Further, the successful delivery of the National Plan for Music Education will be jeopardised.\n- LA funding to music hubs has already been cut by 1/3. Hubs received £14,344,043 from local authorities in 2012-13 despite pressure on local authority budgets (Source: Key data on Music education hubs 2013). In 2011-12 this figure was £21,288,142 (source R Hallam). The amount contributed by schools and parents has also declined. It is essential to note that much of the funding described as coming from schools actually comes from parents. For example I pay £80 per term for my son’s euphonium tuition. This is heavily subsidised by the school who pay roughly the same amount for each pupil learning an instrument with the music hub.\n- I understand that nationally, continuation following First Access opportunities has already dropped significantly. It would be jeopardised in many authorities by removal of LA funding, which would impact on disadvantaged children the most. These are the children who need additional funded support simply to receive the same opportunities as other children. Paying privately for lessons is simply not affordable for many parents.\n- Music makes a dramatic difference to children, academically, intellectually, socially and emotionally, as Darren Henley observed in his report and as explored in Professor Sue Hallam’s article The Power of Music, which summarises the evidence in support of music.\n- The creative industries are worth £36.3 billion a year to the UK and the music industry is worth between £3.5 billion and £3.8 billion (depending on the measure used). [Research by UK Music and PRS for Music.] There are 2million jobs in the Arts. Creative industries cannot be sustained only by retired people with disposable income; the sustainability of these industries rests on growing new audiences and new participants. To do this, children need to be inspired and engaged. In my local authority area for example, music and the arts are key to tourism as Suffolk is home to venues such as the internationally-renowned Snape Maltings (and Aldeburgh Festival), The Apex in Bury St Edmunds and DanceEast in Ipswich.\n- Two examples of what music hubs can do when appropriately funded and supported: currently all Suffolk state schools (regardless of whether they are involved in First Access or other programmes), are invited to perform in Snape Maltings every year in a week-long Schools Celebration of Music. Each year about 1600 primary and secondary school children from schools across the county (including special schools and alternative provision), participate. This event, which always succeeds in being inclusive yet highly professional, has been led for over 25 years by a partnership between the county music service and Aldeburgh music. I have seen for myself the enrichment this provides (these photos give an idea) and that is simply not available without the input and dedication of the music hub. Just this week I and other parents from my daughter’s class attended a concert put on by the music hub which brought together 300 children taking part in the First Access programme from local primary and special schools. The children spent the morning working together learning songs and instrumental pieces to perform together – being given the opportunity to collaborate, to listen, to experience the joy of performing. This is one of several such days the music hub puts on each year. We cannot afford, culturally or economically, to lose such opportunities.\n- In a recent poll, of those expressing an opinion, 85% of British adults back Michael Gove’s statement, taken from the foreword of the National Plan for Music, that ‘music education must not become the preserve of those children whose families can afford to pay for music tuition.’\n- More than 110 organisations from across the music industry are already backing the Protect Music Education campaign and have expressed concern at the recommendation from the Department for Education that local authorities cut their support for music services.\nConsultation Question 4b If you do not think this could be stopped altogether, how much of a saving could local authorities make to these services? If cost pressures on central support services have changed recently, please describe below.",

And whilst she’s busy pretending otherwise, her government has cut our public services leaving schools with a £3 billion funding gap, social care in chaos, and public sector workers without pay rises.\nLabour always strives to create a more equal society, which is why Labour MPs across the country stand for more investment in our public services. As the old saying has it: prevention is better than cure. Failure to invest leads to increased costs in the long run; a more equal society is not only better for us, but also more affordable in the long term. If the Brexit vote has taught us anything it’s that across the country, people know from experience that this country is not a fair and equitable place to live. We need to change this, and to challenge the policies that give rise to it. That ‘s why I’m standing for election.\nI was fortunate to be parliamentary candidate for South Suffolk in the 2010 election. I live and work in the constituency and my particular interests and campaign experience continue to be in education, health and the environment, about which I shall post more over the coming weeks. I know that it is an extraordinary privilege to be a parliamentary candidate – it brings opportunities to meet people and to visit schools and workplaces and to understand more about the work that is done here and the community that we live in. I also know that, thanks particularly to the tireless work of local activists and the 2015 parliamentary candidate, Jane Basham, it’s a seat in which there is more Labour activity than you might think.\nI love living in Suffolk: it is not only beautiful to look at but full of towns and villages with a clear sense of community. Yet that sense of community is threatened by increased inequality, impoverished public services, and decisions – most notably on housing – that fail to take account of the needs and wishes of local people. Now that the Brexit process has been started, we can’t afford to exchange the protections of the EU for a power-grab by big business. I’m standing to be MP for South Suffolk as I want to work for a Suffolk that is not only beautiful to look at, but has secure, effective public services, and is a vibrant place to live.\nIf you want to contact me during the election campaign, please email me on emmajbishton@gmail.com\nFor more information on Labour in South Suffolk go to http://www.southsuffolklabour.co.uk\nEmma Bishton is Labour’s parliamentary candidate for South Suffolk #GE2017.

In fact I’ve been a member of the Transition Nayland committee since it started, but I’m not as active as I would like to be. This is partly because, like most of us, I have many competing demands on my time – believing in something and doing something about it aren’t always as close together as we’d like them to be.\nI’m sure most of us would choose a more sustainable future in which we are not confronted by large rises in oil prices due to the reality of Peak Oil, and are not disturbed by changing weather patterns as the ice caps melt. Both climate change and Peak Oil are highly inconvenient to our modern way of life, but they are irrefutable; unfortunately the scale and breadth of the challenge can make it seem impossible to act.\nThe good news, though, is that personal change does make a difference, both in how we think about the environmental impact of what we are doing, and in demonstrating to others (not least politicians) that there is an appetite for action. The Transition movement exists to encourage those personal changes as well as facilitating action on a larger scale – whether that is investing in photovoltaics on the school roof, recycling something, or swapping surplus apples for pears so they don’t go to waste.\nAlong with the rest of the Transition Nayland committee, I recently watched In Transition 2.0 (available online), a film about the impact the Transition movement has made in communities across Europe and the USA. Transition had changed how people used local resources (e.g. a community garden project), and had created real social benefits within the communities. It reminded me how far the values of Transition have spread, but also how widespread the need for it is. A strong community – whether local or international – can reinforce sustainable behavior and help discourage the old habits of the carbon age.\nEach tiny change, like me resolving to shop more locally, can cause ripples of change that can gradually build into a sea-change.

  "https_emmabishton_wordpress_com/https_emmabishton_wordpress_com_2013_03_11_celebrating-music-in-suffolk-schools/content_96.html": "Last week I had the pleasure of accompanying Nayland primary school ukelele group to perform in Snape Maltings as part of the Suffolk Schools Celebration of Music. That event – which I’ve referred to previously in this blog – is a fantastic opportunity for children from schools across Suffolk, regardless of their experience or level of musical knowledge, to come together and perform in the wonderful acoustic of one of the UK’s top professional concert halls. I have now been three times to this Celebration; each time it has succeeded in being inclusive yet professional, and each time the children have gained enormously from the experience.\nThe benefits of opportunities like this go far beyond the performance on the night – enjoyable and thrilling as that is. So events like this must be protected, in demand, and supported. But the rhetoric from the DfE – whilst on the one hand supporting the inclusion of music in the primary curriculum – suggests that creative endeavour is of little value. Creative arts subjects remain excluded from the EBacc and the A’level equivalent as schools are encouraged down ever-narrowing lines of academic enquiry. That’s why I followed the lead set by the Bacc to the Future campaign and wrote today to my MP – Tim Yeo – asking him to include the creative arts subjects in these school league tables. The text of that letter is below. I’ll add the reply when I receive it.\n“Dear Tim\nI am writing to ask your views and intended actions in relation to the omission of creative subjects from the Government’s English Baccalaureate (EBacc) and the equivalent A-level league table measures.\nCurrently EBacc and A-level equivalent league tables place significant pressure on schools to focus on just five ‘pillars’ of study: maths, English, sciences, languages (including Ancient Greek and Latin) and humanities (defined as just history and geography).\nI appreciate the importance of English, maths and science as core ‘enabling’ subjects. But the exclusion of creative subjects from the EBacc and ABacc threatens the delivery and acquisition of a broad and balanced education and puts our creative economy and the creation of jobs in that sector at risk. I understand that computer science was included in the EBacc after substantial lobbying from the IT industry about the importance of computer science to the UK economy. The Arts should be considered on the same basis – there are over 2 million jobs in the Arts in the UK, and the Arts contribute over £60bn a year to the UK economy and £36.3bn in Gross Value Added (according to the Government’s own figures).\nHundreds of businesses, education and creative industry organisations have called for the Government to include creative subjects in the league tables and the absence of creative industry relevant subjects has been criticized explicitly by the CBI, Creative Industries Council, Royal Institute of British Architects, the Incorporated Society of Musicians, the Include Design campaign, Heads for the Arts, UK Music and BPI – the British Recorded Music Industry.\nPersonally, I am against the use of EBacc and ABacc as mechanisms for measuring the performance of schools, and the relevance of the ABacc appears particularly questionable. However I acknowledge that these are current government policy and my purpose in writing is to encourage you to ensure that these measures have the least damaging effect possible on Suffolk schools and children.\nAs a musician I have for many years volunteered in my children’s schools to assist them in providing enriching and enabling experiences through which children – regardless of their academic abilities or prior musical experience – can flourish. In the last two weeks alone I have accompanied children from Nayland Primary School in their performance at the Suffolk Schools Celebration of Music in Snape Maltings and directed a school choir at the Sudbury performing arts festival. Aside from my personal experience, there is a wealth of evidence that points to the advantages such opportunities give children – for example helping to develop confidence and self-esteem, and promoting collaboration. These aren’t just skills necessary for learning across the curriculum, they are also qualities employers seek.\nThese opportunities need to be provided across the school system, as children grow, not just in the early years. Yet the messages to schools from the Department for Education loudly and clearly suggest that creative arts subjects are additional and voluntary.\nPlease could you raise these concerns with the Prime Minister and Secretary of State and secure the place of creative industry relevant subjects in the EBacc and equivalent A-level league tables.\nI look forward to your reply.\nYours sincerely\nEmma Bishton”\nPosted by Jayne Kennedy on 11 March 2013 at 7:01 pm\nThe fact that some schools really rely on the goodwill and expertise of parents such as yourself in facilitating music also needs to be addressed. More emphasis on music teaching in ITT would help, as would including music in league tables – just to focus school leaders….",
  "https_emmabishton_wordpress_com/https_emmabishton_wordpress_com_2013_07_25_ramping-up-the-health-bill/content_72.html": "It’s been a bad summer for the future of healthcare in the UK. Not just because of the now-constant stream of bad news ranging from poor standards of care to staffing crises in A&E. Not just because of the continued sale of the nation’s silver – from Blood Plasma UK to healthcare data to community care services, with much more set to follow as a consequence of the so-called ‘reform’ of the NHS. But also because the government has completely failed to put in place any preventative measures that would reduce demand on our overstretched healthcare system.\nSmoking, obesity and alcohol are the three most significant causes of preventable deaths in the UK. Smoking causes heart disease, lung disease, and more than a quarter of all cancers. Half of all long-term smokers will die prematurely as a consequence of smoking, on average dying 10 years earlier than non-smokers. Drinking more than moderate levels of alcohol causes accidents, heart disease, cancers, liver failure and more.\nSo there is a huge personal cost currently being borne by the UK’s smokers and drinkers (about 21% of the UK population smoke, and around a quarter of us drink more than moderate amounts of alcohol). But there is also a huge cost to healthcare. Admissions to hospital from conditions caused by drinking too much have more than doubled in ten years. And for every smoker who dies of a smoking-related disease, there are 20 people living with a smoking-related condition which they, and their health-care providers, need to manage.\nThe costs of dealing with these ‘lifestyle-related’ diseases have been estimated to be in the billions for healthcare alone (i.e. excluding the lost revenues from sickness absence and lost economic opportunity, and excluding the cost of policing our town-centres at night when they are overloaded with people who in turn are overloaded with cheap booze).\nSo how has the government responded? Academies can ply their pupils with cheap food high in sugars and fats which doesn’t meet minimum standards for school food. Plans to introduce minimum pricing for alcohol have been shelved. And then the ‘development’ which caused the (Tory) MP Dr Sarah Wollaston to tweet “RIP Public Health” recently: plans to introduce plain packaging for cigarettes have been ‘put on hold’ pending evidence from elsewhere.\nReducing the attractiveness and supply of tobacco is number one on the World Bank’s list of actions in their tobacco control strategy. Along with offering support to smokers to help them quit (which has been shown to work, and has immediate and long-term health benefits), reducing the likelihood that people start smoking is crucial to reducing the numbers of people smoking.\nMost smokers start smoking before the age of 19, and teenagers are typically interested in branding and style, so you’d think that making packaging – and with it lifestyle images – less attractive would be a good thing. And it’s rather hard to see any disadvantages of pursuing this approach.\nSimilarly, increasing the unit price of alcohol would have minimal impact on most of us as consumers (though it does disadvantage supermarkets and other retailers wishing to push alcohol sales as loss leaders, hardly a bad thing) and sets a cultural context for talking about alcohol-related harm. That might sound boring but it is necessary, because unlike smoking, where any amount of smoking is bad, the discussion about alcohol is much more subtle: some alcohol is often a good thing, it’s just that it takes less wine or beer than we tend to think to reach harmful limits. (By the way it’s not ALL bad news – in Ipswich there is a fantastic example of localities taking on the agenda on for themselves – off-licences in the town have entered a voluntary agreement to stop selling cheap high-alcohol drink.)\nBut this government appears to see things rather differently. You might think they would wish to be credited with measures which not only improve public health, but also save the public purse – not least in the face of the huge challenge our health and social care system is already experiencing from an ageing society – but it seems not. We have plenty of effective ways of supporting people to quit smoking and to reduce alcohol consumption, just for starters (and I’m sure I’m not alone in being worried about the long-term future of early-intervention services such as these, but that’s for another day). But unfortunately we have got so caught up in arguments about what Lynton Crosby did or didn’t say (this representation by Steve Bell in yesterday’s Guardian is worth a look), that the nation is losing sight of the real prize – better public health. And the government is getting away with pursuing a free market in healthcare (no doubt funded by us as individuals through private insurance before too long) at the same time as allowing the free market in calories, alcohol and nicotine to operate untrammelled.\nAs a consequence, the government is ramping up the healthcare bill. There is another possible ending to this story, so why isn’t it being heard?\nPosted by nearlydead on 25 July 2013 at 10:28 pm\nReblogged this on nearlydead.\nPosted by Emma Bishton on 25 July 2013 at 10:43 pm\nmany thanks",

On Tuesday she announced some changes to primary school assessment tests (the dreaded SATs). My daughter did SATs earlier this year, and I was one of many who were unhappy enough with SATs and their impact on children and schools that I considered withdrawing her from school during SATS week, so I was interested to hear what she had to say.\nJustine Greening’s announcement included the welcome withdrawal of the threat that children who had been deemed to ‘fail’ their SATs would have to resit them in year 7, and the equally welcome statement that the KS1 spelling and grammar test remains voluntary (though quite who would volunteer to do such a test is beyond me!). She announced that a review of primary assessment is needed and forward-promoted a consultation into primary school assessment which will start in the spring, and that meanwhile there will be no new tests introduced before the 2018-19 academic year.\nSuch stability might sound like a good thing, but that still leaves thousands of pupils and primary schools facing an every-narrowing curriculum and unnecessary, stressful tests for the next two years at least, in order to carry on jumping through a series of hoops of the DfE’s choosing. (After all, if a week is a long time in politics, a year is an eternity for a 10 year old.) That is more than a shame, when she could have taken the opportunity to suspend SATS altogether given that they are not actually about pupils at all, they’re a means of manufacturing school league tables.\nUnlike her predecessors, Michael Gove and Nicky Morgan, who given to zealously issuing edicts, Justine Greening clearly has a more conciliatory, listening tone. And in acknowledging that a review of primary school assessment is needed, she appears to question, at the very least, the merit of some of the policy that she has inherited. But in announcing that the DfE will launch a consultation, she’s missed a opportunity. That the DfE will be involved in such a consultation suggests that she shares her predecessors’ enthusiasm for micro-management and policy leadership in an area where there is no shortage of actual independent experts who are willing and able to provide appropriate guidance for politicians to act on. The Headteachers Roundtable, for instance, have already gone to the bother of producing an alternative education Green Paper which neatly explains why using pupil assessment to measure school performance is a bad idea, and proposes alternative solutions for both pupil assessment and school accountability, I hope she already has a well-worn copy of that on her desk. (As yet the Green Paper doesn’t come with a summary, let alone one aimed at parents rather than headteachers, so I recommend a large coffee before starting to read it!)\nI don’t know whether Justine Greening is already talking to the Headteachers Roundtable. But she does say that she is interested in talking to parents, as well as teachers and unions (though no mention of experts, interestingly). I just hope she doesn’t cherry-pick her parents.\nLast month saw the launch of a new educational ‘campaign’ called Parents and Teachers for Excellence. Now I think you’d struggle to find parents or teachers who were against excellence, so even to the vaguely cynical the group already sounds like an exercise in spin. But if you take a closer look, you’ll find that this apparently ‘non-partisan’ group which claims to be separate to the Westminster elite appears to be nothing but a soft mouthpiece for Conservative education ‘reformers’. (Of the 29 people on its advisory group, only 4 are listed as parents, CEOs or other leaders in Academy chains figure prominently, and the group includes the governments’ ‘Behaviour Tsar’ as well as a former education advisor to the prime minister). It doesn’t look very independent to me.\nThe group describes itself as a campaign seeking an evidence-based approach to education. I’m with them on that, but only if they start off from a neutral position, not from a perspective that uses ideological assumptions as if they were some kind of truth. In my dictionary, non-partisan means not taking sides. Yet the stated starting position for this group is that they already know free schools and academies “work”. (Oh and behaviour policies, knowledge-based curriculum, and increased testing. Apparently.) We parents just need convincing, it would seem.\nPTE are also keen to promote ‘enrichment activities’. Absolutely nothing to disagree with there, enrichment is exactly what the word suggests (though it should happen within the curriculum, as well as outside it). I try not to be too cynical, but it’s hard to avoid wondering if they have added in the enrichment line to distract us from all the other market reform stuff. PTE has financial backers, so unlike other education campaign groups involving or aimed at parents, it’s got money. Quite whose, we have no idea – though the ‘donate’ button features prominently on their webpage and they are keen for people to contribute to their cause as they will, apparently, “never have the resources enjoyed by those opponents of change in the education system”. (Their words, not mine.) And quite a lot of people stand to benefit from those DfE reforms. Just not most pupils, teachers or parents.\nThose pupils, teachers and parents could all benefit from Justine Greening’s forthcoming consultation on primary assessment. Especially if it’s properly done, and independently led by experts. If Justine Greening wants to really engage with parents and make sure we are on side in her efforts to improve both our children’s education and their experience at school, there are other parent groups already out there – not be as well-connected to the Westminster elite, or with secret financial backers, but which don’t have an agenda apart from wanting their children’s schools to deliver a positive experience with good outcomes. Groups such as Let our Kids be Kids, or Rescue our Schools. Ms Greening, we’re waiting for your call.",
  "https_emmabishton_wordpress_com/https_emmabishton_wordpress_com_2013_06_08_would-you-like-aspic-with-that/content_74.html": "The following letter was published in the East Anglian Daily Times on Friday 31st May, in response to an article in the same paper a few days previously. That article covered a meeting between the local MP, Tim Yeo, and a group of business owners from Sudbury, Hadleigh and large villages nearby, which the business owners had requested in order to discuss reforms needed to the system for determining business rates. Reports since indicate that Mr Yeo has pledged to take their concerns to Eric Pickles, the Communities Secretary, providing that they can demonstrate that their increase in business rates over the last 10 years is out of proportion to their rise in turnover. This doesn’t, of course, address the fundamental problem the business owners wished to address – namely that the system for determining business rates favours out-of-town outlets over town-centre premises – but it might at least be the start of a discussion.\nDear Sir\nI was surprised by Tim Yeo’s response to Sudbury business owners as reported in last week’s EADT (MP blames internet shopping for decline in High Street, May 24th). He is chair of the Select Committee on Energy and Climate Change, and has far greater understanding than many of his government colleagues of the energy issues facing us, and the need to ensure communities are sustainable. Yet in refusing to address the key issue – that it is harder to make a profit for a small town-centre business than it is for an out-of-town retail outlet which pays lower rates – he misses the opportunity to support both the social and economic structure of local communities and to promote lower-carbon ways of shopping. And why no reference to Mary Portas – his government’s advisor on high streets?\nIn presenting his view of the future Mr Yeo also appears not to know that many people cannot easily travel to out-of-town retail outlets, and that very many people – especially amongst the elderly – are neither keen on nor confident shopping via the internet. He may wish to retire to a market town where there is nothing to do but move from one coffee shop to another (excellent as many of them are), but I don’t imagine most of his constituents do.\nyours sincerely\nEmma Bishton",

I understand that this involves prioritising certain actions and measures. But I am dismayed that the government’s messaging about the self-employed so far is that it is ‘operationally difficult’ to find ways of providing financial assistance to those of us whose income has literally disappeared overnight. It is, after all, just as ‘operationally difficult’ to be a freelancer with no income as it is an employee. Given that other countries have succeeded in doing It also makes the decision seem a political one, not one borne from governing out of necessity.\nThis is not just about paying our own bills, essential though that is. It is also about protecting the skills that individuals hold and supporting the places and institutions which are key to our cultural identity, sense of wellbeing, and status. All of our concert halls, churches, local theatres, pubs and arts centres have fallen silent. These are places that usually ring with the voices and sounds of people coming together – whether that is for an international concert, a local band, entertainment at a children’s party, or a singing group for people with Parkinsons. Crucially they are also the places where we are paid, as freelancers, to use our skills. They are also a vital part of our local economies. Not for nothing are they called the creative industries.\nCreative industries are dependent on people and their skills, usually built up over years and years. The decisions government takes now about how to support those individuals are likely to have ramifications for the creative industries for years to come, and for the population as a whole. The creative industries, in my case music, are where we experience joy, hold the capacity to share and express grief, gain purpose, share a sense of endeavour, and come together. As and when we all emerge, blinking, from this crisis, we will collectively need to do this more than ever.\nPlease take action now, to protect those of us who are self-employed and the industries we work in.

  "https_emmabishton_wordpress_com/https_emmabishton_wordpress_com_2014_06_19_protect-music-education/content_63.html": "I’ve just replied to the DfE consultation on the use of the Educational Services Grant (ESG), which the DfE wish to cut substantially. This grant is used to help fund a range of education-related services including pupil welfare, sports and music services. Local authorities don’t just use this grant to fund these services, they fund them from revenue budgets also. For music, the really damaging statement is this:\nOur expectation is that music services should now be funded through music education hubs (which can cover one or more local authority areas) and from school budgets, not from the ESG.\nDfE funding to music hubs (via the Arts Council) has already reduced. So where then should music hubs (which primarily provide services to schools) be getting their funds from? There’s no Big Society Donor out there that I can see, wanting to pay for millions of children to experience music-making. So this statement effectively legitimises local authorities from withdrawing all funds from music services, whether they are paid for through the ESG or any other funding stream. the ISM are leading a campaign: Protect Music Education and have led the charge for responses to the DfE consultation and helpfully provided a template response. Here’s what I sent: Dear Ms Barbour, I am responding to the Department for Education’s (DfE) consultation titled Savings to the Education Services Grant 2015-16 recommending that local authorities stop funding music services. The consultation includes the expectation that local authorities stop funding music services, stating “Our expectation is that music services should now be funded through music education hubs (which can cover one or more local authority areas) and from school budgets, not from the ESG”. I am asking for the Department for Education (DfE) to withdraw this expectation and instead recommend that local authorities continue to fund their music services. My response is solely concerned with the recommendations for funding music education and addresses questions 4 a, b and c.\nConsultation Question 4a Are there any reasons why local authority expenditure on central support services could not be significantly reduced, if not stopped altogether? Please give details below. Yes. National Plan The National Plan for Music Education sets out a vision for music education in England which depends on the combination of financial support of the Department for Education, schools and parents, and local authorities. In the foreword to this plan, this complex funding structure was recognised as was the interdependence between the different elements of the music education sector. The Department for Education has made public commitments to access to music specialists, saying ‘it is important that music education of high quality is available to as many [children] as possible: it must not become the preserve of those children whose families can afford to pay for music tuition. While music touches the lives of all young people, the disadvantaged can benefit most.’ This statement is particularly pertinent given recent reports from Ofsted that white working class children are achieving the lowest outcomes. Without music hubs providing services such as First Access class instrumental lessons (as they do in my LA, Suffolk), these children are significantly less likely to encounter opportunities for making music and its associated benefits if music hubs are not resourced to work in schools. The LA is in a position to mandate music hubs to direct use of LA funds to support disadvantaged children in particular. It should be encouraged to do so, not least because of the cognitive, emotional and social benefits that children derive from participating in music activities. (These benefits include developing skills which workplaces require, such as collaboration). The DfE, in reviewing the use of the ESG, could use this as an opportunity to direct LAs about their responsibilities in this area instead of appearing to legitimise withdrawal of services.\nThe Henley report recognised that primary schools teacher training does not equip trainee and NQT teachers with the skills and confidence to deliver on the music curriculum. And the vast majority of state schools have neither the expertise nor the specialist resources to deliver programmes like First Access in-house. The key to ensuring the quality and sustainability of musical opportunities for children is to ensure the continuation of national, local, school and parental funding for music education hubs which not only provide direct services but also support the school teaching staff.Funding National funding for music education hubs distributed via the Arts Council is already reducing from a high of £82.5 million in 2010-11 to just £58 million in 2014-15. If local authority funding is also lost, access to musical tuition and a good music education will become the preserve of a few (the most well-off) Further, the successful delivery of the National Plan for Music Education will be jeopardised.\n- LA funding to music hubs has already been cut by 1/3. Hubs received £14,344,043 from local authorities in 2012-13 despite pressure on local authority budgets (Source: Key data on Music education hubs 2013). In 2011-12 this figure was £21,288,142 (source R Hallam). The amount contributed by schools and parents has also declined. It is essential to note that much of the funding described as coming from schools actually comes from parents. For example I pay £80 per term for my son’s euphonium tuition. This is heavily subsidised by the school who pay roughly the same amount for each pupil learning an instrument with the music hub.\n- I understand that nationally, continuation following First Access opportunities has already dropped significantly. It would be jeopardised in many authorities by removal of LA funding, which would impact on disadvantaged children the most. These are the children who need additional funded support simply to receive the same opportunities as other children. Paying privately for lessons is simply not affordable for many parents.\n- Music makes a dramatic difference to children, academically, intellectually, socially and emotionally, as Darren Henley observed in his report and as explored in Professor Sue Hallam’s article The Power of Music, which summarises the evidence in support of music.\n- The creative industries are worth £36.3 billion a year to the UK and the music industry is worth between £3.5 billion and £3.8 billion (depending on the measure used). [Research by UK Music and PRS for Music.] There are 2million jobs in the Arts. Creative industries cannot be sustained only by retired people with disposable income; the sustainability of these industries rests on growing new audiences and new participants. To do this, children need to be inspired and engaged. In my local authority area for example, music and the arts are key to tourism as Suffolk is home to venues such as the internationally-renowned Snape Maltings (and Aldeburgh Festival), The Apex in Bury St Edmunds and DanceEast in Ipswich.\n- Two examples of what music hubs can do when appropriately funded and supported: currently all Suffolk state schools (regardless of whether they are involved in First Access or other programmes), are invited to perform in Snape Maltings every year in a week-long Schools Celebration of Music. Each year about 1600 primary and secondary school children from schools across the county (including special schools and alternative provision), participate. This event, which always succeeds in being inclusive yet highly professional, has been led for over 25 years by a partnership between the county music service and Aldeburgh music. I have seen for myself the enrichment this provides (these photos give an idea) and that is simply not available without the input and dedication of the music hub. Just this week I and other parents from my daughter’s class attended a concert put on by the music hub which brought together 300 children taking part in the First Access programme from local primary and special schools. The children spent the morning working together learning songs and instrumental pieces to perform together – being given the opportunity to collaborate, to listen, to experience the joy of performing. This is one of several such days the music hub puts on each year. We cannot afford, culturally or economically, to lose such opportunities.\n- In a recent poll, of those expressing an opinion, 85% of British adults back Michael Gove’s statement, taken from the foreword of the National Plan for Music, that ‘music education must not become the preserve of those children whose families can afford to pay for music tuition.’\n- More than 110 organisations from across the music industry are already backing the Protect Music Education campaign and have expressed concern at the recommendation from the Department for Education that local authorities cut their support for music services.\nConsultation Question 4b If you do not think this could be stopped altogether, how much of a saving could local authorities make to these services? If cost pressures on central support services have changed recently, please describe below.",

This is not the time for blame – unless of course that blame is directed in a focused way at the Tory party for putting us all in this mess (which, after all, only arose because David Cameron was unable to keep his own team in order), and the Brexit campaigners for wilfully leading the electorate as a whole up the garden path with no clear strategy for opening (let alone closing) the gate. And I can’t think of a worse time to appear to be demonstrating to the party membership as a whole that only the views of the Westminster elite matter.\nI didn’t vote for Corbyn. Nor am I very likely to vote for him an another leadership election (not that I disagree with many of his principles or policies). But the news today really should not be leading on Labour party stories, it should be on exposing the gaps in the Brexit response and the potential through those gaps for making the best of things right now. I would really like to know, for example, what the Labour party’s position is on the potential for the SNP to block Article 50 and whether they would support this.\nTo state the obvious, support for EU membership is not a straightforward party-political question. The more you appear to be taking responsibility for the resulting vote by allowing the frenzy to be directed simply at Corbyn, the more you fail to recognise that, and the more ammunition you are giving the Tory Remainers for future use.\nThe media like nothing better than an internal party squabble, so why on earth are you handing it to them on a plate? Yes, there may be an election before very long. And yes, leadership is an issue that won’t go away in a hurry. But come up with some positive principles and responses first that the disenfanchised Labour voters of our cities and the north can own, and get out there and talk to them. That will, in the longer term, need to be a strong narrative on how or even if neo-liberal policies have anything to offer any longer in pursuit of reducing inequalities. A change of leader alone will provide you – and us – with no certainty or policy position on any of this. Arguing amongst yourselves about leadership might be getting some of you somewhere, but it’s doing nothing whatsoever for the rest of us in the party. Please, STOP IT NOW.",
  "https_emmabishton_wordpress_com/https_emmabishton_wordpress_com_2017_07_12_pass-the-inkwell/content_34.html": "Last night I watched the year 6 play, which this year took us through periods in time, under the direction of a Time Lord. We visited Boudicca (and some Romans), Beethoven, a second world war kitchen, and even got as far as the ancient Egyptians, before landing safely back in the village hall in the present day. Every child in the year 6 class (24 of them this year) had a speaking part. Every child sang and danced, albeit some more than others. And every child contributed to designing and selling tickets, painting the set, and so on.\nThe year 6 summer play has become a tradition here ever since the primary school has had a year 6 (until 2013 the school ended at year 4 and pupils then went to the middle schools which have now closed). It wouldn’t happen at all, of course, without hours and hours of additional volunteering from teaching assistants to make costumes, source props and so on, teachers of the other classes being there to help, and significant support from the lighting and general backstage guru in the local drama group. It is put together in a whirlwind of activity which starts after the summer half-term as a kind of antidote to SATs.\nSome of these children have been in village plays, been regular members of school choir or performed in other ways inside and outside school. But most don’t have those experiences. The point about the Year 6 play is that, whatever their starting point, all the children are on stage. All collaborating, all memorising lines (even Mr Gove would be proud!). All supporting each other, whether that’s to remember what comes next, put on a costume or to get onto the stage in the first place. I can’t be the only person who derives enormous pleasure from watching children who are not the natural performers in the class grow in confidence, looking out at the audience and enjoying their lines, as the evening progresses. One can only presume that these are experiences our education ministers haven’t experienced for themselves. Why else would they think children will learn more from the precise positioning of the constituent parts of a semi-colon?\nYou read that last bit right. The government Time Lord, aka Nick Gibb the education minister (no-where near as entertaining as the year 6 Time Lord even when he tries), has decreed that these same children must leave school able to position a hand-written semi-colon not just in the right place but with the comma element of the semi-colon positioned correctly “in relation to the point of origin, height, depth and orientation”. The reason this has come to light is that it turns out marking of semi-colons (and other punctuation) has been inconsistent. Some children get a mark, others don’t, for exactly the same answer. (This hasn’t just been an isolated incident; the headteacher who brought it to public attention received over 5000 tweets last weekend from teachers frustrated by inconsistent SATS marking). So these children, freshly exuberant from their year 6 play, are supposed to go out in to the world knowing that the system is pitched against some of them for no better reason than the whim of a government department which has forgotten to move out of the nineteenth century.\nI’m not saying children shouldn’t learn grammar. (They should, it’s useful in learning how to write effectively.) And I’m not saying their learning of grammar or anything else shouldn’t be assessed. (It should – by their teachers.) Just that learning the precise alignment of a hand-written semi-colon isn’t likely to be something they make much use of in adulthood, or even in the rest of their schooling. Not now that we have exchanged inkwells for laptops and ledgers for spreadsheets. Nor is the precise alignment of a semi-colon – even when consistently marked – a sensible thing to judge schools by, which is what happens with the SATs results. Whereas confidence, the ability to do things that at first seem outside their comfort zone, self-belief and collaboration are all necessary attributes for embracing the world of work and becoming healthy, engaged and active citizens. Which is what, in my view, education should be for.\nThese children are lucky. We have a village hall complete with stage in which the children can perform (the school hall isn’t big enough for the whole school let alone a play). And people willing and able to help. But they are also lucky because they are at a school where the staff still have the capacity to fight for what children need to learn as well as delivering what they are told to learn. The memory, the skills and the sheer enjoyment which the year 6 class displayed on stage last night will stay with them long after they have forgotten the precise height, depth and orientation at which the constituent parts of a semi-colon must be drawn.",

  "https_emmabishton_wordpress_com/https_emmabishton_wordpress_com_2014_03_03_dear-tristram-hunt/content_83.html": "I sent this letter to Tristram Hunt, the shadow education secretary, earlier today, and will of course update the blog once I have a reply. I’ll expand more on what I mean by principles and overview on subsequent posts.\nDear Mr Hunt\nI’m writing to express my concern about the policy intentions you published over the weekend. I’m sure I won’t be the first Labour Party member writing to you today, or the last parent to express such views.\nI don’t know the policy detail. What I do know is that things are in a mess, and that education policies which appear – at least on the face of it – designed to appeal to a small group of potential voters, won’t sort out the structural and systemic problems in our education system.\nAs you know, there are, sadly, examples throughout the country of education provision in distress. Here in Suffolk we’ve seen at first hand the wasteful and divisive effects of Free Schools, and also have the misfortune to be home to the first for-profit school, widely rumoured to be about to be given a bad Ofsted. Granted, these schools were set up in a fit of ideological pique, despite a wealth of evidence about the surplus of school places in Suffolk and the need to support other school changes already underway in our county. But sorting out the mess that has been left behind doesn’t just mean stopping unqualified teachers from working in state-funded schools of any sort, or ceasing the Free School programme (welcome though both of these statements are). It needs something bigger, surely?\nThe NHS has in its time been subject to countless structural changes, as you well know, and none more damaging to its identity, equity of provision and service culture than that imposed by the Coalition in 2010. But having a clear structure should not be in itself damaging, it’s the constant twisting and turning that causes the harm. Conversely, education has seen the opposite: no structural overview, dwindling accountability to local people, and a blurring of boundaries between providers and commissioners (the rise of the academy chain). To make matters worse, there is Michael Gove’s pervasive assault on the motivation of teachers and the optimism of parents.\nWe talk about our ‘education system’. But in reality, it’s a series of mini-systems, most of which don’t join up, and many of which have competing priorities. So faced with all this chaos, why isn’t Labour trying to sort out the fundamentals? Why, instead, do we have to be subject to more statements about micro-policies such as how long to teach maths for (isn’t that a professional decision, not a political one, by the way?), and why do we have to keep pandering to the notion of choice for some (Fraser Nelson’s ‘pent-up’ parents), rather than making sure every parent’s children can attend a good local school? You have made some positive statements – for example about valuing vocational training, and supporting the establishment of a Royal College of Teaching, but it seems to me that such messages are in danger of getting lost in the storm.\nI fully understand that getting from where we are now to a more equitable and confident system will take considerable planning, effort and time. I’m a parent, not an expert, and I only have some idea of the policies you wish to pursue. But I do believe fundamental change can and must be achieved. I appreciate some of the debate is tough: we are where we are now, as they say. But first teachers need to trust you. Parents need to trust you. And so do our children. So please, open up the debate and make it about the principles and the overview first, the detail can follow.\nYours sincerely\nEmma Bishton\nPosted by Emma Bishton on 2 June 2014 at 4:07 pm\nWell I now have a reply. Tristram Hunt outlines\n“three crucial areas of Labour’s parent-led academy agenda:\nprioritising investment to areas of need (crisis in primary school places)\nAll teachers to be qualified\n‘proper systems’ for financial accountability, transparency and local oversight’.\nHe expands slightly on the issue of oversight – Labour supports school autonomy but would bring back more local co-ordination and accountability to prevent a ‘free-for-all’ market in education (what we now have in Suffolk) – and refers to David Blunkett’s proposal for a Director of School Standards.\nAll fine, as far as it goes. I understand (though don’t support) why Labour wants to continue with school autonomy. But what I’d really like to hear is a bit of passion about every child deserving – and getting – a good local school. And that the way to achieve a rounded and lasting education is a proper comprehensive system. I’ve written back.",
  "https_emmabishton_wordpress_com/https_emmabishton_wordpress_com_tag_suffolk/content_81.html": "Suffolk County Council, with the RSA, have launched an inquiry into education and learning in Suffolk – “Raising the Bar”, amidst concerns that attainment is not as it high as it should be. They are right to be concerned; Suffolk is a relatively affluent county (though affluence at county level masks areas of significant deprivation) and results are therefore not as high as might be expected. For some years, SCC have blamed lower attainment on the three-tier system, hence the closure of middle schools which is now underway. Others might (in my view reasonably) attribute some of the effect to relatively low funding in our Suffolk schools, but that is presumably beyond discussion at this point.\nThe schools reorganisation will not be complete for some while, and there is much systemic change taking place simultaneously as well as the RSA Inquiry, plus four new free schools which we are told will raise standards, so it is unclear what results will be attributed to which intervention over what time-frame. Leaving that aside, ‘Raising the Bar’ is laudable in its own right. My problem with Raising the Bar is not its purpose, not its aims, nor the call for ideas, and especially not the desire to bring parents and teachers into the debate. My problem is working out where ‘the bar’ is. To be fair, this is not just a problem in Suffolk, it is a problem across the English system.\nOur primary schools are generally well-received. Our secondary schools, on the other hand, mostly get a bashing. (And this was the case before Michaels Gove and Wilshaw started adding to the diatribe). According to the politicians and much of the media, our schools and teachers fail our children: they don’t get enough qualifications, those qualifications aren’t hard enough to achieve or don’t equip them for work (and as of this year, the grading of these qualifications appears rather arbitrary anyway).\nAs a parent, of course I want my children to get a good range of qualifications which will equip them for whatever the next stage of their life is. But that isn’t all I want from their education: I want them to have opportunities for creativity and physical activity, and I want the school to help them to be emotionally and physically fit and healthy, able to make effective and morally-sound judgements, and to demonstrate the kinds of social skills which are useful for life, never mind the workplace. An English Baccalaureate doesn’t show me any of those things. Yes, I know, a lot of that is also my job as a parent. But not exclusively – school shows them that the views of parents aren’t arbitrary but exist within a system, and helps them get the hang of how to operate in that system. There are quite a lot of schools that do all this, and more, already. But they don’t get recognised for it unless the school also gets above a magic percentage of A*-C at GCSE and an Outstanding Ofsted. And continues to do so. (We are stuck in a peculiar dilemma – if students’ results improve the exams must be easier, but if schools’ results (from these same students) don’t improve, the schools are failing in their task.)\nStatistically (and despite the protestations of many free school proposers) schools can’t all get better results than each other, nor can they all be in the top 10%. A bit of reality would be helpful here – literally raising the bar is what will help more pupils than raising the attainment of a few, and anything which helps achieve this from this review will be worth pursuing. But I digress – what I really hope will come out of this review is some way of understanding when our schools are performing well in more ways than simply counting GCSEs or EBacs. And of celebrating that, rather than being drawn in to the constant disparagement of our schools.\nHere’s hoping the Suffolk review really does lead to some thinking across the county about what our schools are for. Then we might be able to work out how to assess their achievement in more meaningful ways. Improvement will follow once we are sure what we are measuring and why.",
  "https_emmabishton_wordpress_com/https_emmabishton_wordpress_com_2013_07_03_banking-on-a-free-meal/content_33.html": "Last week I went to the food bank in Ipswich which is part of the local charity FIND (Families in Need). FIND has been around for some years, and the need to support vulnerable families, especially at times of crisis, is not new. But the rise in need for regular foodbanks run by charities like FIND (and in other areas the Trussell Trust) is a more recent development. Demand for food donations is clearly rising, and it is no surprise to most people – other than the most entrenched or blinkered – that demand has risen since the changes to welfare benefits took effect.\nFIND delivers food parcels direct to people’s homes, rather than asking them to come to a central point. And people can’t just ask for food, they have to be referred by a statutory agency (e.g. a social worker). But even without the stigma of having to go to a central point to collect the food, would you want to use a food bank? I wouldn’t, and I don’t think I’ve ever met anyone who would choose this above being able to put food on their own table. So quite why Lord Freud thinks that the rise in food banks is an example of supply-led demand (as reported in today’s Independent), I have no idea. He came into government when bored of banking, it would appear. To say the rest of us are rather bored with hearing bankers expressing opinions they are unqualified to hold would be an understatement larger than I’d care to measure.\nFIND is run by Maureen Reynel – a woman who like other inspiring people I have met in the voluntary sector appears both tough and tireless. She seemed to me to typify the kind of person David Cameron may have had in mind to deliver his vision of the ‘Big Society’ – people active in their communities, able to motivate and organise others to give up time, money and resources in the pursuit of a more resilient and contented society. But there is a world of difference between a society in which people willingly volunteer to do things like listening to primary school pupils read, taking elderly people who can no longer drive to appointments, or clearing scrubland, to one in which the welfare system is predicated upon some people giving food to others. Badging work like that of FIND as creating ‘community resilience’ doesn’t even attempt to disguise the desperation with which ‘resilience’ is used a euphemism for “being less dependent on services”. Time for Lord Freud and his team to wake up and smell the coffee.",
  "https_emmabishton_wordpress_com/https_emmabishton_wordpress_com_2013_05_06_what-colour-is-the-curriculum/content_82.html": "In his ongoing quest to diminish the influence of educational experts on education, Michael Gove proposed a new curriculum for key stages 1,2 and 3, which was out to consultation during March and April. The proposals were roundly criticised for a number of reasons, by people well-placed to do so. The proposals for history caught the attention of people, like myself, who have an interest in education but are not experts, perhaps because they seem to value teaching ‘what/when‘ over ‘why’. What has received less coverage is that Mr Gove appears to be using these proposals to undermine the scientific consensus on climate change, pandering to the sceptics in his party.\nIn the proposed curriculum, children are required to learn about weather, biodiversity, habitats and electricity – all in themselves necessary. However, reading the proposed programmes of study one could be forgiven for assuming that we live in a static world – where resources are stable and infinite and where there is no challenge to our daily way of life. But this isn’t the case, and it’s most certainly not the case for the children whose learning will be based on this new curriculum: they are the generation who will need to adapt to, and mitigate the impacts of, climate change and peak oil. In the current curriculum there are requirements to study the interactions between populations and the environment (e.g. KS3 geography) and sustainable practices (e.g. KS3 citizenship) but in the new proposals there is little other than a reference to the ‘efficacy of recycling’ (in KS3 chemistry).\nThe vital discussion about how we adapt to live in – not off – our environment can’t just be left to the few teachers with the interest, timetable freedoms and resources to do so, especially when there is so little freedom and flexibility for individual teachers.\nOur Transition group (Transition Nayland) submitted a response to the Department of Education as part of the consultation on these curriculum proposals. You might be forgiven for wondering why we bothered, given the extraordinary intransigence of the DfE, which appears never to engage in dialogue even during ‘consultation’. But here’s why: we can’t afford not to. Our children need to learn how to adapt, and they in turn will need to teach successive generations to do the same.\nOur principal objection is that the proposed curriculum does not meet the essential overarching criterion, as set out in legislation (Education Act 2002), which ‘prepares pupils at school for the opportunities, responsibilities and experiences of later life’. This is because they will not leave school equipped as outlined in the science and geography curricula: to understand ‘the uses and implications of science, today and for the future’ or ‘how…humans interact with the physical world and how this changes over time’. Crucially, they will not have been required to consider the rights and responsibilities of being a global citizen in today’s world. I fear that the efforts of organisations like Transition groups will seem lost for a generation if there is no central narrative, no underpinning principles learnt from school and carried forward for life.\nPerhaps Mr Gove is out of touch on this issue – and even out of touch with several in his own party. Last Thursday, the Green Party fielded more candidates than ever before in the county elections, and 22 of them got elected. Some will say that the Greens are just a party of protest for those on the Left, or somewhere else for disaffected LibDems to go, and there may be some truth in both points. But fundamentally the Greens propose ways of adapting how we live in our changing world – a message which, given the scale of the challenge, can’t be ignored by any political party (except UKIP, of course, who to date have succeeded in just ignoring it). Getting the curriculum right will build public understanding, and create a generation of scientists equipped to find and implement solutions that will create a more sustainable future.\nSo far Transition Nayland has had just the standard ‘Thank you for your response – we’re very busy’ from the DfE. We’ll report any proper response (or even better, any changes that result) on our Transition Nayland website.\nPosted by dougla nadler on 1 November 2014 at 3:51 pm\nHi Emma,\nI read your article in Transition Free Press this spring and I thought you and Transition Nayland may be interested in participating in a walk this July in Britain that was inspired by our group’s walk in Presteigne, Wales on 21 September as part of the People’s Climate March. Your ideas on how we can make this walk successful would be appreciated as well.\nFor the Earth Community,\nDouglas Nadler\nThe Converging Climate Walk across Britain in July 2015\nBritain started the Industrial Revolution, and now it must lead the world towards the Low-Carbon Revolution\nThe impact of the Industrial Revolution on humans and the natural world is now being acutely felt. It is time for Britain to lead a new Low-Carbon Revolution, which is now essential for world stability. Since Britain was the world’s driving force in the technological and societal changes that brought about the global Industrial Revolution, it can be easily argued that there is an ethical duty for Britain to be the leading inspiration to stop rapid climate change.\nThe September 2014 People’s Climate March has shown us that many governments, companies, faith groups and people in general are keen to enact a renewable energy commitment, as well as initiate actions for the entire Earth Community that can place Britain as a leader once more.\nOur vision is that by mid-July 2015 extensive partnerships will be in place for groups of people to set out from all corners of Britain on a walk to demonstrate their commitment to a low-carbon economy/culture. Travelling in relays and converging from all directions, the groups will initiate a Great Circle of Britain to firmly establish an unshakeable resolve to transition rapidly away from the fossil-fuel economy/culture in Britain and embrace climate/Eco-friendly solutions.\nWe envisage that the event will draw support from a wide variety of groups and individuals of all ages, including Transition Towns, businesses, schools and colleges, faith groups and walking groups, writers, musicians, dancers, storytellers, painters, sculptors, actors, industrialists, economists, scientists, agriculturists, low -carbon transportation supporters, renewable energy enthusiasts, naturalists, historians, health professionals, advocates for social and climate justice, social media networkers, and representatives of political parties from town council to national government.\nSome groups might follow long-distance footpaths or cycle. Some might acknowledge key places, events and people that shaped the Industrial Revolution, such as James Watt’s birthplace in Greenock, or Ironbridge Gorge in Shropshire, but also to pay homage to those places and voices along the way that celebrates the low-carbon pathway for our world. On each leg of the journey there will be possibilities to create a range of bold climate-change responses to fit each local area’s values and aspirations.\nGrassroots efforts including everyone are essential. A symbolic green torch of flowers carried by the participants in each section of the walk will be handed over to the next group. Each section of the walk will close with a gathering including a Dance of Unity celebrating the Earth Community, with the next group joining in to begin their part of the walk the following day. The impetus can then be carried on in that community, with plans to implement local solutions to mitigate climate change. Tree saplings can be planted at the end of each local walk as a sign of commitment. People wishing to walk beyond their own geographical area to the Great Circle will intensify and expand the conversation and ultimately the regional solutions.\nThe ‘Great’ in Great Britain can then be restored. A Great/Green Britain is what we all wish!\nNo man is an island entire of itself; every man\nis a piece of the continent, a part of the main;\nif a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe\nis the less, as well as if a promontory were, as\nwell as any manner of thy friends or of thine\nown were; any man’s death diminishes me,\nbecause I am involved in mankind…..\nJohn Donne",

I don’t expect to agree with him on everything – I’m Labour and he’s a Tory. But I am rather disappointed that he chose to signpost me to a media article rather than finding out ‘from the horses mouth’ what the government position actually is on this Inquiry. I have replied to this effect.\nDear Emma\nThank you for taking the time to write at length on this important subject.\nI note your involvement in dementia services, which I applaud; and your experience as a Parliamentary candidate. Given the latter, you will be aware that the press sometimes ‘run away’ with things discussed in the Westminster village. I am not entirely clear myself on where we are with this ‘enquiry’. The following piece seems to suggest that it was not a formal Government enquiry, particularly the last two paragraphs:http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/the-principle-of-a-free-taxpayerfunded-nhs-must-be-questioned-says-tory-health-minister-10395991.html\nEither way, there is no doubt in my mind that a) as a Government we are committed an NHS free at the point of delivery, funded to the amount requested by NHS England with a further £8bn by 2020; but that b) when talking about long-term pressures it makes sense to be open minded. There is rather a temptation it seems to me in parts of our polity to suggest that if anyone so much as question the sustainability of funding, they must want some harsh private system dominated by American conglomerates who will list our hospitals on the stock market and laugh while the poor and vulnerable go untreated. The reality is that we should want whatever policies will deliver the best care. There seems strong consensus across the House of Commons that this is best achieved by a free NHS. I personally do not see that changing but let us not rule out innovation or blue sky thinking which would be to the detriment of debate.\nThanks again for taking the time to write.\nRegards,\nJames\nJames Cartlidge\nMember of Parliament for South Suffolk\n020 7219 4875\nPosted by Emma Bishton on 5 August 2015 at 11:54 pm\nI asked my MP to deny or confirm that the Inquiry is government policy – ie. to seek out and reference an official government response rather than signposting me to a media report.\nHe has replied (very promptly) suggesting that the whole proposal was media speculation.\nThe Inquiry was not media speculation. Granted, in the Hansard record of the debate that took place on 9th July (http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201516/ldhansrd/text/150709-0002.htm) , Lord Prior supports the tax-payer funding model for the NHS before going on to talk about setting up the Inquiry. But I’m no closer to knowing whether or not the government is allowing parliamentary time and resource to be spent debating alternative funding models for the NHS – or whether there is an underlying motive for them to do so.",
  "https_emmabishton_wordpress_com/https_emmabishton_wordpress_com_tag_pshe/content_76.html": "Last night (before my MP was in the news for other reasons entirely) I joined many others across the country in emailing my MP to urge him to vote for the amendment to the Children & Families Bill being debated on Tuesday. This amendment would make PSHE and SRE education part of the statutory curriculum – much overdue, and very much needed. More information on the Consent to Consent campaign which led to this amendment being tabled is available here. Here’s what I wrote:\n8th June 2013\nDear Tim\nI am writing to ask your voting intention in regard to the amendment to the Children and Families Bill due to be debated this Tuesday, 11th June, and to urge you to vote in favour of the proposed amendment. As you are aware, the amendment proposes changes to the curriculum that would see the addition of PSHE to the National Curriculum, make age-appropriate Sex & Relationships education a statutory component of the curriculum at all four educational key stages, and specify that same-sex relationships, sexual violence, domestic violence and sexual consent be covered in the PSHE curriculum. Building on the reasons already articulated by the Coalition of Consent Campaign, there are four reasons why I believe this amendment is not only timely, but necessary:\nCurrently schools are only required to ensure that pupils understand how to use contraception and why it is important. They are not required to ensure that pupils understand the context in which contraception is used – i.e to help develop their understanding of healthy, appropriate and loving relationships. Nor are they required to ensure that children leave school understanding what constitutes a healthy diet, or able to address poor self-esteem and low confidence.\nAs a parent in your constituency, I am confident that the schools my children attend understand the importance of PSHE and SRE and also that they comprehend the necessary breadth of these subjects. But I am also very concerned about the context and culture within which these schools now operate; one where increasing test scores in core skills – important though this is – takes precedence over ensuring that children leave school as mature, confident citizens who can display both a love of learning and a readiness to take on the challenges of adult life. Anxiety about budgets and timetable capacity for key skills has, I understand, already led to schools in this region reducing pastoral support and PSHE provision. The proposed amendment would put PSHE and SRE back firmly within the school curriculum.\nThe UK Youth Parliament have made A Curriculum for Life (which includes compulsory PSHE, with a mandatory training programme for teachers), their priority campaign for 2013. They did this because they understand why pupils need to be taught vital life skills at school, and because they have first-hand experience of the wide variation between schools currently in terms of both the position of PSHE on the curriculum and the consequent quality of teaching provided. Responding to the UKYP by supporting this amendment would demonstrate that the government really is prepared to put service-users at the heart of policy-making.\nFinally, the educational case for including PSHE and SRE is clear. Pupils who demonstrate ‘risk behaviours’ (e.g. alcohol-misuse, unsafe sex, anti-social behaviours) are more at risk of school exclusion or truancy and less likely to achieve their potential. But pupils who are supported to achieve positive wellbeing (in relation to healthy lifestyles, emotional & mental wellbeing and relationships) demonstrate higher attainment. Evidence for this is provided by – amongst others – The Young Foundation in their report “Noticing the Change – a Framework of Outcomes for Young People in Practice” published in March this year.\nI look forward to the debate on Tuesday which is not only overdue but very much needed, and hope to hear that you have voted in favour of the amendment.\nyours sincerely",
  "https_emmabishton_wordpress_com/https_emmabishton_wordpress_com_2016_01_20_doctor-knows-best/content_24.html": "On Tuesday, as I listened to David Cameron on the Today programme, I found myself wondering why it is that Tories often seem to know better than the professionals when it comes to fixing problems in our public services. Cameron was trying (yet again) to defend the government’s proposals for junior doctors on the grounds that we need a 7-day NHS in order to improve outcomes for people admitted at the weekend. As Sarah Montague pointed out to him, that particular argument has already been thoroughly discredited.\nSo why do Cameron and Hunt persist in trying to win an argument using evidence that has effectively been thrown out of court? Partly, of course, because they are hoping that the general public aren’t reading the small print in the first place. Partly, because they know that most of us won’t understand the technical and statistical language that the critics (who include the medical director of NHS England, no less) are (rightly) using to point out why Hunt is wrong to say what he does. Partly, too, because the government are trying to win the argument by reducing the trust that people generally have in doctors. As the odds are rather against politicians winning a trust game against doctors, the politicians are left playing the mortality card (the “we’re the ones who will protect you when it really matters most” one). And finally, because they know better than the doctors. Apparently.\nI bet neither Mr Cameron nor Mr Hunt tells their chauffeur how to drive, or a plumber how to fix their sink. Nor do they appear on news programmes offering management solutions to the private sector. So what is so different about the people who run and work in our public services from the people who run and work in the private sector? Does being paid by the tax-payer render them immediately less knowledgeable and less skilled than their equivalents in business? No. Does agreeing to pay the NHS bill make Cameron and Hunt overnight experts on management techniques useful for wringing most benefit from an under-resourced, multi-layered and complex organisation? No. It does give them a say in NHS priorities, but not in how to go about achieving them. Having an interest is not the same as having expertise. Better political leaders would be spending time working with the doctors and all the other health service professions to maximise benefit from the system, not playing trust games and trying to assume superior knowledge.\nI’d expect a plumber shown the same disrespect as Cameron and Hunt have been showing the doctors to walk away from the job. I’m not surprised the junior doctors are doing the same. It may be too much to hope that Cameron and Hunt stop misusing statistics, but let’s hope the junior doctors get the courtesy as well as the working conditions they need.",
  "https_emmabishton_wordpress_com/https_emmabishton_wordpress_com_2017_03_09_dear-lord-nash/content_30.html": "The article in the TES about your speech to the Challenge Partnership national conference last week certainly made me think. (It seems I’m not alone, judging by the comments the article provoked.) You covered much ground, but here are my initial concerns about what you said.\nWhy do you think that education always has something to learn from business? Is it really a one-way street? Does business have nothing to learn from education? I’ve worked in the public sector for 25 years. That doesn’t make me blind to bureaucracy, but it does help me to see the benefits of a shared sense of endeavour focused on something bigger than profit. And it doesn’t make me blind to all the news stories about businesses whose eagerness to appease their shareholders gets in the way of customer service, or staff wellbeing. In short, I don’t think we’re yet at the point where social workers, doctors, and teachers, similarly beleaguered though they are, feel they have much to learn about work ethics and accountability from bankers.\nThe TES reports that you also said that good school leaders “always put children’s interests before those of adults.” Well yes. Their whole job is think about children’s immediate, medium-term and long-term interests. But these same school leaders are being asked to act in their school’s interest, not the interest of their pupils, through the association of test scores with league tables, through Ofsted and academy-takeovers. It would be quite helpful if you could point that out to the Secretary of State.\nI was glad to hear your concern at the amount of time teachers spend planning lessons (and your suggestion that teaching practice follow the evidence). As a parent witnessing the daily struggle that my children’s teachers, and my teacher friends, have in finding enough hours in the day to be a teacher (never mind anything else), I am all too aware that they are struggling to keep pushing the ball up the hill let alone to make it roll smoothly. But your solution is that teachers “embrace standardisation”? Where relevant, they already do: teachers share lesson plans, they share online resources, they discuss goals. The idea that they aren’t already looking for ways to save time is quite laughable. The reason they prepare for lessons is to make sure they are completely familiar with what it is that they will be doing, why they are doing it, and what they are hoping to achieve by doing it. In much the same way that anyone would read up on a subject before giving a speech about it. One lesson education might learn from business is that raising staff satisfaction pays dividends. Devaluing teaching by turning teachers into delivery systems for off-the-peg resources is the exact opposite.\nOne more thing. You are quoted as saying: “I think in the past too often teachers have confused their individuality with their professionalism”. It would be helpful (never mind polite) if you could supply some evidence for this assertion.\nIn summary, it’s difficult not to conclude that you are mainly interested in the business opportunities that necessarily arise from a market-led model in schools, promoting a proliferation of educational ‘products’ – be they teaching robots, or test papers.",
  "https_emmabishton_wordpress_com/https_emmabishton_wordpress_com_category_musings-on-education/content_49.html": "I like the sound of my own opinions. (A characteristic that I imagine to be common to most bloggers.) But I do find it depressing to find myself opining repeatedly on policies causing anxiety, frustration and concern to the majority, especially when the available evidence supports a different policy-course altogether. Such frustration has clearly been felt by academics, commentators, politicians and teachers long-opposed to a return to selection and grammar schools, as news of Theresa May’s desire for more grammar schools has filled the airwaves for the last week. (On the plus side, she has succeeded in creating some unity across political divides and amongst the educational establishment!)\nEven the BBC, normally so anxious to produce two sides to a policy argument (even when that leads to completely lopsided arguments being presented as if opinion was equally divided), had to portray Theresa May’s stance as politically-motivated rather than arguable on the basis of evidence. That’s because the evidence clearly shows that selection at 11 does not improve educational attainment across the system, nor does it advance social mobility. Grammar schools are good at stretching the pupils who attend them, not at improving the life chances of those who don’t.\nTheresa May has been very clever. She is portraying ‘meritocracy’ as somehow intrinsic to our sense of ‘British values’ (whatever they are). And she is banking on the assumption that we Brits, supposedly, care more about potential than reality. In her world of potential, every ‘deserving’ child could get a place in the grammar school; in the real world, of course, the majority will be rejected. Like the Free Schools debacle, where increasing the choice of schools is presented as more relevant than improving all schools, this is a policy for parents, not for pupils. In another similarity, it’s very difficult to see how a return to selection is practically possible outside large towns and cities, unless all schools are suddenly to be provided with the additional resources required to bus children from one market town to another. I’ve got to hand it to Mrs May (and to Justine Greening, who as Education Secretary is the person actually charged with trying to make it happen): so far they’ve managed to talk about returning to a pass/fail system as if it’s an ‘everyone gets a prize’ system. As if their new selection system will be like the modern version of pass-the-parcel where there’s a sweet in every layer, rather than one single prize in the very middle of the parcel like there was when I was a child.\nEducation isn’t a prize. Or it shouldn’t be. It’s a right. Leaving aside the arguments in favour of a comprehensive system from an educational and social perspective, there’s a far more simple problem Mrs May could have chosen to address: there simply isn’t enough money in the system right now for all schools to provide that basic educational right for their pupils in a way which actually meets their needs. Structural changes cost money (ask the NHS), as well as creating uncertainty for staff and children. If she really believes all children really do deserve a good education, surely the target for her limited resources should be improving the educational and life chances of ALL the children in the poorest areas, not just the academically gifted ones?\nI passed the eleven-plus, being in the last year group in Somerset to go through selection, and I got a good education in a school that was half grammar, half private (that being the kind of compromise that school systems had to make in rural areas). My children are getting a good education now – but in a properly comprehensive school which doesn’t educate them at the expense of their peers, like mine did. For all the attempts at assuring us that the new policy will not result in the same two-tier system that operated when grammar schools were last commonplace, it is impossible to see how this could actually be done in practice given the limited resources available.\nRant nearly over for now, though doubtless set to be repeated over the coming weeks. One more point for now: the White Paper on education that was published earlier this year included, amongst the chaos of mass-academisation, the proposal that teachers do not need to be qualified. Quite where the White Paper sits in Justine Greening’s in-tray is currently unclear, but if the proposals in it carry on through parliament, we are left with the very real possibility that not only will many schools be losing funding under the new funding formula – in addition to the financial squeeze all schools are under anyway – some schools will be employing unqualified teachers. (And I’ll bet it won’t be the selective ones.) So much for improving our education system. If they carry on like this, there won’t be a parcel to pass around at all.",
  "https_emmabishton_wordpress_com/https_emmabishton_wordpress_com_2016_09_01_what-is-teaching-for/content_40.html": "The new school year is fast approaching, and the next few days see teachers finalising their lesson plans whilst pupils enjoy their last few days of summer freedom and parents like me wonder what they have forgotten to buy. I’m approaching this new school year with a little trepidation though – as for countless other parents this year, I will no longer have a child at primary school. Like those other parents, I’m suddenly prone to making rather repetitive but somehow inevitable comments about how fast my children are growing up.\nTeachers don’t age though. Or so we think – unless we carry on meeting them in adulthood, they become fixed in our memory at the point when they taught us. Which is why it always seems slightly discombobulating to meet them years later. I did just that earlier this summer, when attending a joyous university reunion of fellow music students from the 1980s. As we prepared to do some formal singing together we all contributed to one of those “in 50 words tell us what you do now” exercises. Former music students are (to the uninitiated) a surprisingly versatile breed, and our number included opera singers, barristers, sound engineers, accountants and of course a fair spread of teachers, amongst other endeavours). One of our former professors was singing with us. His 50 words were telling: he was visibly moved and spoke of his pride at the people we had become – not for specific achievements (though some of these were noteworthy), but for having been able to play a part in helping us to become the people we are today. It struck me that it isn’t just pupils who are stuck in a time-warp, few teachers get to see their students 30 years on. But I think his sentiment is shared by teachers everywhere.\nA bit later this summer I had the privilege of observing some teaching on a summer music course. Such courses are of course free from the usual strictures and structures of term-time lessons; they should be (and in this case are) fun, and give the student the opportunity to be ‘a person playing the cello’ rather ‘the cello pupil’. As if to demonstrate this one of the teachers began a masterclass by asking all the students to tell her their name and something (other than music) they like doing. Not a new trick, but one that makes it clear to the student that the subject of study wasn’t the only thing of relevance or of interest. Music is, of course, a deeply personal business. Once there’s enough technique to play whatever piece is to be played, it’s the way in which the player communicates their connection to the music which matters. So in finding the way to help this emerge it may be more obvious to the onlooker that a music teacher is thinking about the whole person than it is with, say, a maths teacher. But we shouldn’t take that to mean that the maths teacher cares less about the person you are, or that you could become. Why, after all, do teachers become teachers if not to influence our future, as much as to inform our present? (And no, I don’t think teachers are saints: just not automatons. But seeing pupils as fully-fledged people is somewhat at odds with the governmental way of looking at teachers as individual subject-programmers.)\nAs parents, we expect our primary school teachers to be interested in the whole person rather than just their subject. But then our children are to some extent cocooned at primary school. There is necessarily more connection between home and school, there is the school gate and the familiarity (at least in general if not in specifics) of the class and classmates. And until relatively recently, our primary school children weren’t treated so much like parts to be processed on a governmental conveyor belt. It’s different in secondary school. The secondary school my children go to has benefitted from an impressive and attractive new building, so when my daughter goes next week it won’t be the same warren that my son navigated in his first few days. But fears about the geography of the school, the bus trip to get there, and the presence of 1000 more children than at primary school, daunting as they may seem to both parents and new pupils, seem to me to be fairly quickly overcome, at least for most. Rather harder for pupil and parents is maintaining the sense that school is still about learning, experiencing and growing in the self, as well as in the subjects studied. Thanks to government’s relentless pursuit of higher PISA ranking (and the desire for economic growth at all costs), we have now been inculcated into a culture in which children, their teachers and their schools appear defined more by test results than by personal characteristics. But it doesn’t have to be this way. At their best, schools set the groundwork for pupils to flourish as people (which some do quickly and others more leisurely), and it is our schools’ teachers who make that happen, with whatever subject (music, maths, or any other) that provides them with the medium for doing so.\nAs school or university pupils, our relationships with teachers are fairly one-dimensional; we rarely appreciate that our teachers have our wider interests (or even any of our interests) at heart. But my experiences this summer illustrate that that is not the case. So as we parents prepare to start the new year defending, endorsing (or occasionally challenging) a teacher’s perspective on some issue, it’s worth bearing in mind that those teachers do actually have our children’ whole self in mind, even if the demands of the governmental conveyor belt make it hard for us to see that. I sincerely hope that my daughters’ new teachers aren’t so defeated by the increasing requirement to view whole pupils only in terms of scores (subject, year group or school) that they are still able to see her as a past, present and future person, when she leaves her secondary school a few years hence.",
  "https_emmabishton_wordpress_com/https_emmabishton_wordpress_com_2010_05_28_what-do-i-think-about-middle-schools-and-free-schools/content_100.html": "When campaigning in the west part of South Suffolk (Sudbury and the villages to the south and north of it), I found that many people, without prompting, expressed their concerns about the local Schools Review. The review means that the current 3-tier system (primary, middle and high schools) will change to a 2-tier one, phasing out middle schools.\nThis change was instigated by the Conservative-led county council, and was first introduced in a consultation back in 2007. I was a school governor at a primary school in Great Cornard at the time, and it struck me – and many others – that the consultation was designed to demonstrate the basis for the council’s (already made) decision, not in fact to ask for people’s views to help come to a conclusion. More of an opinion poll than a consultation.\nThe council argued that better exam results in 2-tier systems made the case for changing from three tiers. To my mind they failed to explore other ways of addressing this apparent inequality or to account properly in their calculations for the different demographics across the county versus the systems in place.\nI don’t really want to focus on the merits of 2-tier rather than 3-tier systems here, or indeed on the county’s current plans for the actual re-organisation. However a significant consequence of the reorganisation is that parent groups have sprung up in both Clare and Stoke-by-Nayland to campaign against the proposed closure of the middle schools in these locations.\nThese campaigns were given a new momentum and focus by the Tory proposals to introduce ‘Free schools’, much vaunted in the election campaign and now included in the Queen’s Speech, and the groups are now campaigning to set up 11-16 High schools as ‘Free Schools’ in both Clare and Stoke by Nayland.\nThe concerns and activities of these parent groups have energised many others, including local businesses and former pupils. As a parent of children set to go to one of these middle schools myself, I entirely understand both the wish for children to attend schools which are as local as possible, and the sadness about losing popular and effective local middle schools. I also cannot fault the determination of these parents to champion their children’s education. However I profoundly disagree that the re-establishment of these schools as ‘Free’ high schools is the answer.\nAs I understand it, the points in favour of establishing high schools in these locations are:\n- they would be small\n- they would be local\n- they promote choice\n- they would set their own curriculum\n- they would capitalise on the energy of the parents involved\n- they would draw on other community resources (independent schools, businesses) and be somehow appreciably ‘different’ from other state schools\nAs I indicated during the campaign, I disagree, and here’s why, taking each of these points in turn and then adding a couple more :\nSmall: is this inherently good? Is big bad? I think as parents we all want to feel that our children are known in their school, and so very big schools seem impersonal, and rather scary. Personally, I’d be uncomfortable with a school of 2000. However, it doesn’t follow that schools of 500 are intrinsically good unless they are good schools for all the other reasons that make schools good. (To my mind the factors that make the most of teachers’ skills and therefore enable the best learning by pupils include clear leadership, high expectations, effective pastoral care and engagement by parents).\nThe most important thing to note about small schools, is that in the state system (i.e. without ‘pupil premium’ paid for by parents), smaller schools are VERY unlikely to have sufficient income to have enough teachers to provide a wide range of subjects and activities, within and outside of the curriculum. There are very definitely economies of scale. Added to which, a school of around 1500 can easily have extremely good pastoral care and therefore knowledge of individual pupils if it is organised in a way which promotes this (houses within schools, for example).\nLocal: Yes – I like the idea of children travelling as short a distance as possible to school, for pastoral and environmental reasons and so that as parents we can be part of the community surrounding the school. But in a rural area, local is only going to be local to a very small group of people.\nChoice: Yes, I can see that a wider range of schools promotes choice and that can be a good thing. But only if all the schools have a fair chance to succeed, and this cannot happen if funding is squeezed (see ‘disadvantages’ below). Furthermore, I have visited all the high schools in South Suffolk during the campaign, and found each one not only to be good but to be discernibly different, not just because they have different specialisms but also because all schools have their own character and identity. We already have choice, but it should also be remembered that choice is only available to those who have the capacity to exercise it. Therefore, what we must promote first and foremost is excellence in all our catchment schools.\nCurriculum: After much focus on the fact that the curriculum had become too focused on academic studies and left out vocational ones, we now have a curriculum for 14-16s which is broad enough to provide for a range of interests, abilities and different career paths. Even without consideration for vocational courses, smaller schools simply will not have enough revenue funding to provide for a wide enough range of individual subjects taught by specialists. For example, three separate science subjects may not be possible. That limits pupil choice, both at GCSE and beyond.\nParental energy: The commitment and energy of the parents seeking to set up free schools locally is extraordinary. However, what happens when this cohort of children have left the schools and their parents move on to other things? Will parents of new pupils be required to help? And what will happen if they do not have the skills?\nIt is already possible to be very involved in schools, as governors, as mentors, as volunteers. I’m sure the other schools in this area would love to harness the energy and commitment of all parents – it’s not necessary to start a new school to be involved in our children’s education.\nDrawing on community resources: This is always a good thing, and it is vital that every school be viewed as part of the fabric of the community, gaining from the community and giving back to it. Sometimes this can be in very obvious ways, and one of the things that impressed me in visiting Suffolk high or upper schools was the use of sports facilities by the community. However, like parental involvement, we don’t need new schools to be established in order to welcome involvement from organisations and businesses in our communities, we can do this now.\nThere are also a couple of other very big disadvantages to the setting up of free schools:\nMoney: Unless there is in fact demand for places that are not already provided for by existing schools, the establishment of new ‘free schools’ would take pupils, and therefore funding, away from existing provision. This would disadvantage those schools and is simply not tolerable. Because of the Schools Organisation Review, there is a perception that this will not happen in Suffolk. However, if a school has a defined catchment now and another school is set up within that catchment, the existing school will lose pupils even though the changes made bringing in the 2-tier system increase the number of year-groups taught. The numbers of pupils gained do not make up for those lost to the new school.\nArguments put forward so far have seemed to me to focus on capital costs only, and of course these are a concern. However, revenue funding is what secures the school’s capacity to help pupils learn, and two competing schools in one catchment means less revenue funding for each school. Revenue funding includes paying for teachers, teaching assistants, pastoral care, heating bills and maintaining sports facilities. And that’s before other issues are considered, such as whether the county council will provide free bus transport for both existing schools and new free schools in an area.\nStandards: Where are the guarantees with Free schools that the quality of education sought will actually be provided? And what would happen to a Free school, and to the pupils in that school, if it failed to deliver?\nPerceptions of the existing schools: Schools, as with all public institutions, can lose ‘stakeholder’ trust and gain negative reputations faster than they can gain positive ones. Negativity is self-perpetuating. The act of promoting new schools as those that will meet parental expectations suggests (inadvertently or otherwise) that existing schools fail to do this. Recovery from this position is hard for the schools, for the pupils at those schools, and for the community in which those schools are based.\nTo sum up\nWhilst the suggestion to establish new schools can be made quickly, and sounds on the face of it a fantastic opportunity, it would take a very long time to undo the damage caused by setting them up. The idea is a bad one unless there is either additional funding around or increased demand for places; neither of these applies in South Suffolk, and I hope this post will help outline the reasons why I believe this.\nOur children don’t (or only rarely do) choose their schools, parents do. And despite the best of intentions, parents may in fact limit the choices available to all children in the area by setting up schools which disadvantage other schools and their pupils, all without giving any guarantee that the new schools will in fact offer what they would want.\nEstablishing new ‘free schools’ would disadvantage other schools and therefore other children. Our children’s futures cannot be secured in isolation from the system which our community needs to be built on. If the energy of the parents wanting closer involvement in their children’s schools could be harnessed in other ways, all our children would benefit.",
  "https_emmabishton_wordpress_com/https_emmabishton_wordpress_com_2015_10_12_fixing-the-fence/content_47.html": "I have just spent a very enjoyable three months working in a community dementia team which is part of a large mental health trust. It was enjoyable because the work was interesting, the team were more than welcoming, and their interest in and compassionate approach to their work – the care of vulnerable people who are often very difficult to care for – was clear. It was also the first time for quite a while that I have worked in detail on the provider side of the fence, which did make me stop and think a bit.\nFor the last few years, I have worked on the other side – in commissioning organisations. Prior to that I worked on the provider side in another financially neglected area of healthcare – learning disability services. (When I say ‘financially neglected’ I mean in comparison to other areas of healthcare: the whole system is underfunded.) So I’ve seen the NHS world from both ‘doing’ and ‘buying’ perspectives.\nI don’t disagree with the split between commissioning and providing in principle: I think objectivity in what is commissioned helps people to focus on what is provided, and also that effective commissioning should lead to a better overview of the system as a whole and a more joined-up approach across health and social care. (Though I do think commissioners need to have worked on the provider side to understand how services really work in practice.) However, what strikes me now is that it is becoming increasingly difficult for each ‘side’ to understand the language and the timeframe for change of the other. This isn’t about the organisations I’ve been working with, it’s about the system as a whole.\nCommissioners who speak of budgets, data collection, immediate service change and targets often seem alien to practitioners: where, in that language, are the needs of the patients in their care right now? Providers, on the other hand, vex commissioners when they point out (in discussion or by their practice) that the needs of people using services don’t neatly fit the boxes assigned to them.\nThis is just the start of the problem. Not sharing language makes it hard to develop trust and respect which are key to effective partnership working. Add to this the very significant challenge that neither ’side’ has enough resource to either commission or provide the an ideal service, and the ’sides’ can end up more interested in defending their position than creating solutions.\nThe less money there is, the more we all haggle, and the more we try to make a problem someone else’s responsibility (the classic health v social care argument, for example, though it also happens on a more local scale within as well as between organisations). Trying to shift responsibilities is a waste of time in the short term and a waste of resources in the long run, and it generates negativity which saps the good will and creativity needed to make the system work at its best.\nAll of this might be effectively managed (and often has been until relatively recently), by both ‘sides’ investing in building productive working relationships and in understanding the opposite perspective. However that’s been stymied by the current obsession with the market. Competition, and the commercial rules that go with it, has been made more important than partnership. Commissioners are being urged to look for greener fields elsewhere. But (at the risk of extending this metaphor too far!), without regular feeding of their root system, NHS providers can struggle to keep their fields looking green and healthy enough to withstand the odd frost. And anyway, the fence between commissioner and provider has become a solid wall, the kind that generates whispers on either side.\nThis isn’t an argument for just throwing money at services. (Though clearly, from the news over the last few days, significantly more resources are required if the NHS is to meet need, let alone expectation.) But it is an argument for knocking down artificial walls and market constructs that get in the way of building the kind of healthy working relationships which are key to delivering more effective services for the ever-increasing needs of an ageing population. Now more than ever we need more certainty for NHS providers and re-investment in effective partnerships across both sides of the NHS fence.",
  "https_emmabishton_wordpress_com/https_emmabishton_wordpress_com_2017_10_24_talking-to-power/content_12.html": "Last week I sat in the public gallery at Suffolk County Council, together with local childcare providers and parents, whilst the county council debated a motion on the problems with the 30 hours childcare policy locally. The point of the motion was to get the Tory council to be more supportive to providers, to apologise for operational problems (like late payment) that have added to the difficulties faced by providers, and to be transparent about how much early years funding is being retained by the council and what it is used for.\nSuffolk has particular problems with the 30 hours policy, partly because our early years funding has been cut by central government, and partly due to poor and opaque implementation of the policy compounded by operational problems.\nSo did our Tory councillors take the opportunity to help our providers? (as let’s face it, some will be forced to close due to this policy). No chance. What we got instead was a display of cheap political point scoring by the Tories, rudeness from the council leader, and no attempt at resolution of the problems. The best to be had was confirmation that the council are lobbying central government about the funding cut. (Whilst Suffolk Tory MPs are busy wagging their fingers at Suffolk for not passing more of the funding to providers, and things just go round in circles.) Members of the public aren’t allowed to speak at council meetings, and how the childcare providers kept their cool I don’t know, especially when, as people whose businesses are threatened by this underfunded policy, they were treated to a lecture by one councillor on how the council must operate sound business practices.\nThe council leader, blatantly putting dogma before service provision yesterday poured oil on troubled waters by declaring on the radio that some providers will flourish and some will struggle as a consequence of the policy. Not the strategic response from a major provider of public services one might hope for for our children, their parents or the childcare providers.\nRoll forward to today and I’m now on the way to the #School Cuts mass lobby of parliament. In one of life’s little ironies (if there is such a thing as a little irony with a potentially life-long consequence), the Suffolk funding rate for early years has gone down, at the same time that the government has proposed a welcome, though insufficient, rise in the funding rate for schools. To give an example of how inadequate the proposals for school funding are, my children’s school faces a loss of over £140,000 by the end of the parliament. And that’s better than most.\nMy MP has declined to meet me today, though hundreds of other MPs are meeting concerned parents, students and teachers from across the country. The story in schools and childcare settings across the country is that at the moment, education from early years to sixth form is undervalued and underfunded. The solutions aren’t hard. Let’s hope someone in power today is actually listening. Preferably the Chancellor.",
  "https_emmabishton_wordpress_com/https_emmabishton_wordpress_com_2011_06_01_a-free-school-near-you-who-gets-to-choose/content_106.html": "The proposers of the free school in Stoke by Nayland are not named on their website. They are only ever named as ‘the Stoke by Nayland High School team’. They have not engaged in a joint public debate, despite requests from our opposition group (Compass), and an independent parent via the Suffolk Free Press (our most local newspaper). They have not held a public meeting since May 2010 (the last meeting they did hold was prior to the general election, in the expectation that free schools would be on the agenda).\nIn response to an email from the Compass group requesting a joint public meeting they stated\n“we have been so involved in the detail of the process for so long that we have not been able to engage with the public, as much as we would have wished to. It is important that we share the exciting ideas and developments with the parents and communities that we are aiming to support in our school.”\nInstead of ‘engaging with the public’ this rather anonymous group has been relying on cold-calling phone calls and registration via their website to show evidence of a demand for the school. (Indeed they even give parents a let-out clause, stating in their public leaflet that you “will not be committing to send your child to this school, merely registering support so we can evidence potential demand and win the necessary funding”.)\nThis is extraordinary. They expect to receive several million pounds of public funds, drawn away from other areas of need, in order to plan for a school which is not required, not wanted and would result in loss of funding for other existing local schools, but without needing to demonstrate actual demand for their proposed school. And at the same time they are not required to demonstrate that there is considerable opposition to the school, and nor is there any means of objective consultation that would highlight the concerns of the community about this proposed school to the DfE.\nA new Free 11-16 school has already been approved by the DfE to open in September this year in Clare in the grounds of the middle school which is due to close under the LEA re-organisation into standard 2-tier education structure. The LEA (at Conservative-led Suffolk County Council) anticipates that local secondary schools will operate at 81% of planned capacity once that school is up and running. If the additional free school at Stoke by Nayland is given the go-ahead, they predict existing local secondaries will operate at 74% of capacity.\nThe LEA has stated that the viability of the existing schools – which support a fairly wide catchment as this is a semi-rural area – is threatened if both free schools are approved. The question of viability is an economic one; there is also a significant concern about the effect these new schools would have on pupil choice, as it is also clear that the breadth of curriculum currently available would be significantly affected by small year groups in the existing and new schools, as well as by reduced income in the existing schools. The catchment school that would be most affected by the Stoke by Nayland school, incidentally, was rated good with outstanding features and had the best CVA level results at A’Level in Suffolk in 2009.\nDespite all this, parents locally are being ‘sold’ a new school. They are being asked to choose a school which purports to be a ‘Thinking School’ (yet they can’t meet some of the criteria for this scheme until they are open). The proposers also claim it will operate in the spirit of a ‘Henry Morris Village College’ and be a community hub, yet there is no evidence that they have consulted with the community on what might be wanted, and no definition of how their ‘community’ is to be drawn. They make no reference to the fact that the secondary schools in this part of Suffolk already host local facilities (e.g. sports centres) and function very much as community hubs for the wider catchment community and the immediate communities in which they are situated. And they suggest that this is necessary to preserve the sustainability of rural villages, when the school would only be in one of those villages and the LEA already provides transport from the other villages to the catchment schools in the market town.\nIn essence, the proposers of the free school are marketing a vision of a school with no regard for the damage it would do to existing schools or communities, seeking to appeal to parents under the impression that ‘big’ (1200 pupils) is bad and that small (600 pupils) necessarily means good – when it is clearly systems and actions that matter for nurturing children, not the size of the school. And as outlined above, they are making claims which they cannot validate at this point. They will not enter into public debate to respond to challenge on any of these points, yet they receive support from our local MP and already have preliminary approval.\nHow is this in anyone’s interest, let alone that of the children who might attend the free school and those who do not, for years to come? Where, Mr Gove, is our right to reply?\n1 Jun",
  "https_emmabishton_wordpress_com/https_emmabishton_wordpress_com_2012_04_15_do-we-need-one-here/content_103.html": "Imagine a rural area of roughly 600 square miles, where the population of around 270,000 is divided between four market towns and a large number of villages (some of which are fairly large and provide facilities for smaller surrounding villages). This area is currently served by a district general hospital known as St Michael’s, based in the largest of the market towns.\nThe population is ageing (by 2021 over 65s will account for a quarter of the population), and the numbers of school-aged children are decreasing. It is a fairly affluent area, with house prices above national average, and although unemployment itself is low, the average wage is less than nationally. Larger towns are within 30-45 minutes drive. However, in common with many rural areas, public transport provision within the area and to the surrounding region is poor.\nHealth and wellbeing are generally good in the area, though as would be expected with an ageing population, there is a relatively high incidence of heart disease and falls (often causing broken hips in the elderly). Public satisfaction with services is generally good, though with concerns about access to services (patient transport in particular), and response times from emergency services. St Michael’s itself is looked on favourably by most people in the area. As part of NHS developments, more outpatient care is now provided in the community.\nThe area is not known for innovation in public services. However in recent years patients in one area (around the village of Abbotsford) have leapt at the opportunity to become more involved in planning healthcare. They recently seized a Department of Health funding opportunity only available for building new hospitals (it could not be used to expand existing facilities), and proposed a new small hospital for Abbotsford. It was to focus principally on delivering elective care in orthopaedics and ophthalmology (hip and cataract operations, for example), as these are areas of high demand by the elderly.\nThe proposal appeared on first glance to have a number of positives: Patients living nearby Abbotsford would travel shorter distances, local GPs would have closer ties with the new hospital, and staff would be more familiar to local patients. As a new build, it would have excellent though limited facilities and was considered likely to attract staff.\nHowever, on closer inspection there were a number of disadvantages: As a small hospital providing a specific set of services, it could not provide extensive consultant cover or intensive care beds, so would not be able to provide for patients with complex needs such as those with additional heart disease or poorly-managed diabetes. So, many patients who might have wished to use the new hospital would still need to travel to St Michael’s for treatment. At the same time, St Michael’s would not need to provide as many routine procedures as now, so would reduce its capacity in these disciplines. But as there would also be an increase in the proportion of complex patients requiring a longer stay in hospital to recover from operations, overall waiting times for surgery at St Michael’s were considered likely to increase, for factors completely outside St Michael’s control. In addition, there would be risks to patients whose condition deteriorates whilst at Abbotsford, as they would need to be transferred urgently to Intensive care beds in St Michael’s or hospitals elsewhere in the region (providing beds were available). Lastly, core costs at the Abbotsford [new] hospital would be relatively high as the hospital would be a stand-alone provider, with its own board of directors. So overall, costs of providing orthopaedic and opthamology services across this rural area would increase, because two hospitals would need to provide the basic service instead of one, yet standards or patient experience would not necessarily improve, as the new service would only be suitable for some patients.\nThe proposal enjoyed significant support from Abbotsford patients. However, given the concerns over the impact on St Michael’s, the potential risks to patients, and the expense, the proposal was considered too risky and was dropped. Yet in education, the opposite happens when Free Schools are proposed in areas like this. Why?",

Faced with a lot of contradictory rhetoric from the various parties and candidates, it can be difficult to know what to believe.\nPredictably, there has been an anti-Labour story being pushed by the opposition parties and those media organizations who think it’s time for a change.\nTo judge Labour on its record, we must consider that record fairly, by looking at it as a whole. The long list of achievements over the last thirteen years that Labour can proudly claim has been too often overlooked by commentators.\nIt takes an effort to think back to the mid-1990s, to remember the state of public services at the end of the last period of Conservative rule. To remember how the Tories’ idealogically-driven removal of investment in public services had made those least able to help themselves worse off.\nBut that is the yardstick that we must use to measure what has been achieved since 1997. The Prime Minister in a speech yesterday made a point of listing these (and I forgive you if you don’t read the whole list – but see how long it is!):\n“You know, it’s been pretty relentless. Non-stop, on the go, never a moment’s let up, working round the clock. I don’t mean the last four weeks…. I mean the last 13 years. Because we’ve been busy.\nBusy changing lives. Busy changing communities. Busy changing this country for the better and forever.\nOn May the 2nd 1997 we set to work – and we’ve been working ever since. And just think the battles we have fought and won.\nThe minimum wage first enacted in 1997. First £3.60 an hour, now £5.80 an hour and now, in Labour’s manifesto, a minimum wage set to rise in the coming parliament not to £6 an hour – but to £7 an hour.\nBritain’s minimum wage is one of New Labour’s proudest achievements. But it’s not my achievement or Tony’s achievement – great as Tony was. No – it is not our achievement – it is your achievement. And it’s the achievement of the people of Britain.\nAnd it shows what good men and women of conviction can achieve when they work together for the common good.\nAnd I’ll tell you what else we’ve done together. On the first day of this campaign, I met a teacher. This isn’t one of those David Cameron type stories – I really did meet her, and she really was a teacher.\nAnd do you know what she said to me about the difference we had made? That back under the Tories she used to teach with a bucket beside her desk because she never knew when the classroom would leak and the kids would have to learn in their coats.\nBut now – after 3,700 schools have been rebuilt or refurbished with Labour – teachers know that we not only fixed the roof when the sun was shining but built hundreds of wholly new schools – and now it’s not old buckets in the classroom but new laptops, new whiteboards and new teaching assistants.\nThat’s not my achievement or Tony’s achievement. That’s your achievement and the achievement of every single person who has voted Labour and joined our fight for fairness.\nAnd do you know what else we’ve achieved by fighting?\n- the shortest NHS waiting times in history\n- three million more operations a year\n- over 44,000 more doctors\n- 90,000 more nurses\n- GPs open into the evenings and at weekends\n- free cancer prescriptions\n- a two-week maximum wait to see a cancer specialist\n- over 100 new hospitals\n- the Winter Fuel Allowance\n- free TV licences and free bus passes for pensioners\n- the Pension Credit\n- the New Deal for the Unemployed\n- full-time rights for part-time workers\n- the Social Chapter\n- record maternity pay\n- for the first time in history the right to paternity leave\n- the biggest programme of council house building for 20 years\n- the Disability Discrimination Act\n- the Racial and Religious Hatred act\n- the Equalities Act\n- the first black cabinet minister\n- the first Muslim minister\n- the first black woman minister to speak at the Commons despatch box\n- civil partnerships, gay adoption, the repeal of Section 28 and yes the right to book into a bed and breakfast\n- devolution: a Scottish Parliament, a Welsh Assembly and, yes, even a Mayor for London\n- the transformation of our great cities with bright new dawns for Leeds, Sheffield, Birmingham, Newcastle, Bristol, Glasgow, Edinburgh and Manchester\n- the Human Rights Act\n- crime down by a third\n- the hand gun ban\n- domestic violence cut by two thirds and rape convictions up by half\n- more police than ever on our streets\n- the world’s first ever Climate Change Act\n- beating the Kyoto emissions targets\n- the tripling of overseas aid\n- the cancelling of debt of the poorest countries\n- the ban on cluster bombs\n- peace in Northern Ireland\n- a Britain in Europe’s mainstream not in Europe’s slipstream\n- free swimming for kids\n- free museum entry\n- the right to roam\n- banning fox hunting\n- the Olympics for London\n- half a million children out of poverty\n- extended schools\n- 42,000 more teachers\n- the best ever exam results in schools\n- Education Maintenance Allowances\n- record numbers of students – and for the first time the majority of students are women\n- a doubling of apprenticeships\n- a Child Trust Fund for every newborn child\n- Sure Start children’s centres\n- free nursery places\n- and Child Tax Credits that this Labour government brought in and which a Tory government would cut because they just do not get it, never have, never will.\nSo when people say that politics can’t change anything – we reply it can, it has – and it will.\nAnd let us never forget that for the advancement of so many of these great causes we had to fight not just the Tories – but the Liberal Democrats too. And let’s never forget the most important lesson of these days – a lesson that is today more relevant than ever. And what is it?\nIt’s simple; when we fight, when we never give up on the fight, when we fight and fight and fight – we win.\nI am proud of what Labour has achieved in government; the manifesto contains an equally long list of things we want to do in the next parliament that will continue the fight against social injustice, lack of opportunity and the lack of social mobility, and keep fighting for fairness, sustainability and a more equal society for all.\nSo when you enter the polling station (and please, please do make time to vote, whatever your political opinions!) remember that list, and vote not just in your own interests, but in the interests of our society as a whole.

The countries change colour when I fill it with something hot, becoming anything from green to dark red in accordance with the carbon dioxide emissions of each country. It’s a reminder of the fact that those countries which burn most fossil fuel per person – e.g. USA and China – are contributing a disproportionate amount to global warming.\n‘Green issues’ have been in the news quite a bit of late. To start with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published its latest report on climate change, in which the scientists stated that they are 95% certain that humans are responsible for climate change and that we need to take action globally now. The publication was accompanied by much dissent from those who disagree (most of whom aren’t scientists). I can understand why people are unenthusiastic about it: climate change is ‘inconvenient’. But finding it difficult to adapt is reasonable; continuing to argue the case in the face of an overwhelming scientific consensus just because our position is unpalatable, is not.\nIf we are going to lessen the impact of climate change on the next generation we need to heed the message of the IPCC scientists and change our behaviours. That’s hard for pretty much everyone. But it is necessary.\nWe’ve known for many years that smoking, diet and lack of exercise contribute to heart disease, one of the UK’s biggest killers. And, faced with a diagnosis of heart disease, people don’t usually question advice that they give up smoking or adapt their diet – however difficult it is to do in practice. Doctors are scientists, and we trust them to advise us, even if the message they bring is sometimes difficult to hear. So what is so different about climate scientists and their advice to reduce the burning of fossil fuels?\n‘Green issues’ have remained in the media since the IPCC report, but not for good reasons. Interest in the IPCC report gave way to party conferences, talk of fuel bills and the merits of paying energy companies for investment in renewable energy. Sadly our government, instead of dealing with increasing energy bills and the profit motive that drives them, seems all too happy to blame renewables for rising costs. So much for listening to the scientists. Cameron et al seem to be so busy celebrating the possibility of a new nuclear power plant that will cost billions yet provide only 7% of the UK’s energy requirements that they haven’t noticed Denmark is on target to generate a whacking 50% of its energy needs from wind power by 2020.\nMost weeks, my local paper carries a story about a proposal for renewable energy in some form. I do accept that some people see renewables as visually undesirable, but they are safe, clean, and future-proof. Fossil fuels, on the other hand, are dangerous (witness the anniversary of the Senghenydd colliery disaster in the news last week), dirty, running out and contributing to global warming.\nTo end on a positive note, I buy my electricity from Ecotricity – which sources all of its power from renewables. It has just broken its pricing link with ‘the big six’ and has put its prices down. Despite all the press to the contrary, it seems there really is room for a different way of doing things. The more energy companies source from renewables, the better off we will all be.",
  "https_emmabishton_wordpress_com/https_emmabishton_wordpress_com_tag_women/content_75.html": "Next Sunday (13th Jan) sees the launch of Suffolk Voices in Stowmarket. This is a new network for women in Suffolk who care about what’s happening in the world and the impact the current ‘austerity drive’ is having on our lives – in particular on our children and families.\nThe tougher things get, the harder it can be to think that our actions can make a difference, and to wonder if there is any point. And the harder it can be to find the time. But action does make a difference – there are plenty of examples of successful community campaigns or political campaigns which show us that: as I turned on my car radio one day recently, BBC Radio 4’s Women’s Hour was interviewing women who have got out there and campaigned – for varying reasons and in a range of circumstances – from seeking justice for the victims of Hillsborough to raising awareness of everyday sexism.\nAnyone who is politically active – to a greater or lesser extent – may have experienced the current sense of ennui and mistrust with ‘things political’ when out in the market square, on the doorstep, or even whilst watching the news. But we need that to change – the current government appears to be doing all it can to change family life, and the social landscape, for the worse. Our services and the people who need them are suffering, and we can’t afford to let the government get away with it. I believe that if we get out there with whatever time we have to offer and get active we can make a difference – whether that’s in obvious political formulations (and we do have a political system, so we do need to regain trust in it, but that’s for another blog post), via politically unaffiliated groups like 38Degrees, or by getting out there in our communities doing something which may seem very small but could make a big difference. Every little does indeed help. One of the people on that Women’s Hour episode – Rachel Owen – had started her campaign by walking into a newsagents and asking him not to display provocative tabloid images outside the shop at eye-level for young children.\nSuffolk Voices is an attempt to make sure women’s voices are heard in Suffolk, and to provide a forum for women to find the solidarity and support to become more active. I’m not a radical feminist, but I do think that sometimes we have a different take on things than men, and also that existing forums aren’t always as ‘female-friendly’ as we (or indeed they) would like. I really hope the network is a success. To get things going, there are three speakers at this event who have a wealth of experience not just of campaigning but of the effects of ‘Austerity Britain’ on women and families here and now. The idea is to hear the speakers, have some time for discussion and meet other like-minded people over a ‘bring and share’ lunch. The network is being launched by Jane Basham, the Suffolk Labour PCC candidate who was very nearly elected to the post in October, and Sandra Gage, community and Labour activist from Ipswich. The launch of the network follows Jane’s tireless PCC campaign which got women talking across Suffolk about things that matter.\nHow will we know if the network is a success? I’m sure that will come up in discussion next week, but meanwhile my first thoughts are that it is successful if it results in more people talking at the school gate about ‘austerity Britain’ and its effects on family life, a few women volunteering to do door-to-door deliveries of election handouts in their street, or even someone walking in to their local newsagent asking for provocative images of women to be displayed inside, not outside the shop.",

Participation in the arts can also be the key to a young persons’ sense of self, and helps increase confidence; crucially young people do not also need to be high achievers in other areas in order to benefit educationally, personally and socially from the opportunities that participation in the creative arts can bring. As much evidence shows (e.g. by the Young Foundation), children & young people with positive self-esteem and who are emotionally resilient are better able to learn.\nHow is this relevant to Raising The Bar? I would like to see the following happen, and think they would bring benefits to children and young people across the county:\n2) High schools and their feeder primaries could be supported and encouraged to do joint arts events such as drama productions, concerts, art shows etc. (as some schools do, or have done in the past). This would not only broaden opportunities for participation, but it would help promote links between primary and high schools for pupils and their parents. It would also, in my view, help give parents a sense of engagement with high schools which (without the school gate routine) can be difficult to establish. One event a year, for example, would not be too onerous, but would nonetheless provide a focus for shared activity.\n3) Suffolk should definitely continue to support the Schools Celebration of Music at Snape, and events for the other performing arts. The Celebration provides an opportunity and enriching experience which simply would not be available to so many pupils otherwise, and makes one of Suffolk’s most significant cultural assets meaningful for pupils and parents living here.",

  "https_emmabishton_wordpress_com/https_emmabishton_wordpress_com_page_2/content_4.html": "It’s the beginning of August. One month before working parents of 3-4 year olds (those who meet the minimum earnings threshold to qualify) will apparently be accessing 30 hours of ‘free’ childcare a week during term-time. Sounds good, doesn’t it! Ah, but look again. It’s another of those chimeras offered by the Government that Likes to Say Yes (but really means No). With the net result that it isn’t looking very likely that many of those 3-4 years will be taking up 30 hours free childcare anytime soon. According to Suffolk Infolink, for example, there are only three providers (two school nurseries and one childminder) as of today registered to provide the 30 hours (out of a total of nearly 500 childcare providers in Suffolk who could be signing up to deliver it). Not exactly a wide choice of handy providers for working parents to choose from come September.\nThe Department of Education wants to promote childcare. For good reason: good early years support and play can help young children to build good foundations in social skills, confidence, communication and so on before they get to school, heading off educational inequality. There’s plenty of evidence to this effect (though it’s been studiously ignored by government and local authorities when it comes to continuing the funding for Children’s Centres, of course). And childcare is expensive for working parents, so all in all it sounds a terrific idea.\nYou can hear the “but” coming…\nTo start with, there are problems with the policy itself. The ‘free’ childcare is only available to working parents who have enough income (but not too much, which is at least something). Now it’s not a high threshold (to qualify parents have to earn the equivalent of 16 hours per week at minimum wage), but that does mean that many of the children who could most benefit, whose parents are out of work or too randomly employed to qualify, aren’t actually eligible for free care. I could go on. The message ‘you have to be the right sort of parent to qualify for our offer’ couldn’t be clearer.\nThe government is of course at liberty to make bad policy decisions. But it isn’t at liberty to expect small businesses, self-employed individuals and voluntary sector organisations to pay for them. Which is exactly what seems to be happening.\nI became aware of this issue during the election campaign, when as a local Labour candidate I was contacted by local childcare providers who have set up a national campaign group called Champagne Nurseries on Lemonade Funding (CNLF). (And if only Labour had got in, childcare would be funded, with the funds being paid directly to providers so they could budget and plan properly. But I digress.) CNLF are rightly angry at being forced to pay for government policy, and even angrier at the mis-selling of the childcare as ‘free’. Many childcare providers are private nurseries, the kind of local enterprise that the Tory government is usually so keen on. But bizarrely, it looks as if government expects the private sector, along with not-for-profit nurseries (both types often providing longer days year-round to meet the needs of working parents), to take the biggest hit.\nChildcare doesn’t come cheap: it needs staff (never mind rent, electricity, food etc). Preferably experienced and qualified early years staff, in sufficient quantities that they can do more than simply feed, toilet and keep the children safe. In preparation for the 30 hours ‘free’ childcare, the DfE (with assistance from Deloitte) did a survey of childcare providers, their staffing ratios and cost, and found that (not surprisingly) on average providers use higher staff-ratios than the statutory minimum. (The word ‘minimum’ is used for a reason. Surely it is no coincidence that 85% of childcare providers have good or outstanding Ofsted ratings, yet average staff ratios are well above the statutory minimum?) And the DfE’s conclusion, of course, was not that parents and providers clearly prefer a staff:child ratio that enables staff to do more than make sure the children stay safe. No, the DfE decided that – despite the real-terms cuts in funding the National Audit Office had previously pointed to them – it must be possible for providers to make savings and provide childcare more cheaply. The upshot? Providers are being paid less than it costs to provide care. Oh and they’re not allowed to pass the shortfall on to parents. So how might providers respond? One way, apparently, is to put staff on ‘more flexible’ contracts. (The kind of contract that could of course render them ineligible for the free childcare if they have young children of their own!)\nThe government, of course, has passed the buck to local authorities to sort out. But they are not equipped to do so. A quick glance at the Facebook page for the CNLF group shows you the kind of advice local authority advisors have been meting out to providers. It ranges from ‘ask staff to work voluntarily until the numbers build up’, ‘pay all the staff same regardless of (relevant and required) qualifications’ to ‘put out a bucket for donations’ to ‘take in the parents’ ironing to do whilst staff aren’t busy’. You get the picture. Advisors have been tasked to do the government’s dirty work implementing an un-funded policy, all the while having to pretend it’s Christmas for parents. Because the government aren’t so much providing free childcare as a free-for-all and a race to the bottom in the childcare market. You’ve got to wonder what kind of childcare MPs and councillors would choose for their own children: nurseries that open the hours the parents want, with qualified and motivated staff who work regular hours and can get to know their children, or providers open when they can afford to be, with minimum staffing levels and a donation bucket to pay for paintbrushes. So much for the value of early years education.",
  "https_emmabishton_wordpress_com/https_emmabishton_wordpress_com_tag_school-inspection/content_88.html": "In thinking more about how to measure schools, and what should be measured, I’ve been looking through a couple of existing websites dedicated to reviewing schools – Schools.net and The Good Schools Guide. The latter follows a set procedure and reviews schools – mostly independent schools – from a parent perspective, and looks at the school as a whole, rather than just at academic results. Schools.net, on the other hand, is an open space where parents or others can submit reviews of schools they know – as there is no set review procedure these reflect personal experiences. These websites clearly serve a market, and it’s good that parents should get more of a feel for the schools they are considering than can ever be gained from reading an Ofsted report or a league table. The problem with these sites for me, though, is that they start from the assumption that as parents we should be ‘shopping around’ for the right school for our children. Shopping around makes sense when paying for a private education – in the same way that it makes sense when choosing a house to live in. And it is of course true that each school (whether state or private) has its own culture and all children are different – so by implication, some children will thrive more easily in some schools than in others. But is extending the choice of schools available really the answer to making sure that our state schools can provide most effectively and consistently for our children?\nIt seems to me that pursuing Choice as driver of the system just increases people’s dissatisfaction with the provision which already exists, by making us focus on what we might have, rather than on whether what we are offered is appropriate. I appreciate that one of the reasons for pursuing increased choice in the system is to increase diversity of provision and raise standards through encouraging people to engage more with the services they are using. But by definition, an education system cannot provide an tailored individual experience for each child; yet proposing a consumer model makes us expect just that and feel dissatisfied when what we want is not available. No-where is this dissatisfaction – and its consequences – clearer than in Suffolk.\nEducation results in Suffolk – both at Key stage 2 and at GCSE – have been considerably below where they might reasonably be expected to be, given the demographics of Suffolk, for some time now – as any follower of the local media will be aware. There is much speculation as to why; reasons put forward (singly or as contributing factors) include low funding per capita, low aspiration (parental and school), poor LEA leadership, the 3-tier school structure (primary, middle and upper schools). Alongside repeating that “it is not good enough” (as if stating the obvious actually facilitates improvement), the LEA have responded to this position by effecting the wholesale (and largely unpopular) closure of middle schools, and commissioning the RSA to lead a review.\nSet school performance in Suffolk against the national political backdrop of constant denigration of our schools, and the result is fairly widespread anxiety amongst parents whose children are yet to go through school. The consequence here in Suffolk? Twenty bids to the DfE to set up free schools, over three ‘waves’ of applications (one special school – which is needed – has been approved as have four 11-16 schools in the grounds of former middle schools – all additional provision). Note this figure does not include any bids submitted in the 2013 application round, and one (a Steiner-influenced school) is now on its fourth bid to the DfE. These bids are all on the the list finally published by the DfE last week, as a result of the British Humanist Association’s persistent efforts to force the DfE to act more transparently in regard to free school applications. To put this in context, there was only one free school proposal for Essex (which also has below-average GCSE performance) over the same time period.\nBy any standards, this is a high level of free school activity in a county with an ageing population and a large surplus of school places already. And all these proposals do (bar those for special/alternative provision) is extend choice for parents. They make no attempt to improve the system as a whole (this is not their intention, I appreciate). Nor, as I’ve outlined previously on this blog, do they provide the kind of breadth of educational offer that will provide our children with the choices they need. Instead they seek to provide brief respite for a minority of parents in this dissatisfied world where the expression of the right for individual choice obscures what it is that we really need our school system to deliver, and how to achieve it.\nTurning back to my starting point, I can’t help thinking that we are setting our schools up to fail before we have even started, by reducing discussion about them to a narrow set of criteria which are fairly easily measurable – and rarely placing this in context anyway. Existing schools can fail to live up to expectation in accordance with the measured criteria, but new schools and proposed schools have no track record on these same criteria so can’t fail. And, except for those few state schools which have been reviewed by the Good Schools Guide, there’s no other point of reference in reports currently that enables us to understand something of the experience of being at a particular school and how our local school compares on these grounds with other schools. The result, in Suffolk at least, is more parents seeking personalised provision, but no more clarity about why our existing schools aren’t living up to expectation or how to help them do so. I believe that if we were having a proper debate about what our existing local schools do (in total, not just in tests) and how we as parents contribute to our children’s schools to increase our satisfaction with them, we would then be monitoring our schools to ensure that they are delivering what is needed – not finding reasons for going elsewhere.",
  "https_emmabishton_wordpress_com/https_emmabishton_wordpress_com_2015_12_22_dear-george-osborne/content_57.html": "Dear George Osborne\nI’ve just flicked through my FaceBook feed in the hope of finding something diverting to read. Instead I found a report of a proposal by by Tendring District Council to charge people who fall over in their own homes nearly £26 for being picked up again. This annual fee would be in addition to the £23 already paid each month by people using the Careline service. According to the council, the purpose of this proposal is to avoid unnecessary ambulance call-outs which would otherwise happen automatically when someone sets off the trigger on their care alarm. Which is all to the good. But why should the person falling over have to pay for it?\nThere’s been an understandable outcry in response to this story. And some of the reports don’t note that the purpose of the scheme is to reduce unnecessary ambulance call-outs, which is a shame. But the fact remains that Tendring council appear to be exploiting vulnerable people by making them pay for support most of us would regard as pretty basic – being picked off the floor.\nAs I write, I can hear an assortment of answers that you will have already prepared to such a story. First up is one of those neutral ‘deflect it’ ones along the lines of “Local Authorities are accountable to their electors for the decisions they make about local services”. Well yes, in theory. But as you know, that’s not how it works in practice. Local authorities are completely hamstrung by the cuts you have made to their budgets. Added to which most people don’t really care which particular authority has made which particular decision – and what’s more they probably don’t actually know. So whilst you exploit that situation by trying to play the elder statesman to the inept local politician, elderly people who have fallen out of bed have to pay to be picked up again.\nThe second response I can hear goes something like this: “We have given additional resources to Local Authorities to make sure the needs of the most vulnerable are met”. Well no you haven’t. You’ve just taken it out of another budget and hoped we wouldn’t notice (integrated health and social care budgets ringing any bells?). And by the way what exactly do you mean by ‘the most vulnerable’? Probably not the same thing I mean, as there isn’t enough money in the system any more to cover the people I (and most other people) might define as vulnerable.\nAlong the same lines is the response that ‘local authorities should be cutting back-room functions not frontline services’. Who do you mean, exactly? Those backroom people who make sure the money is being spent properly, the ones who have to fire people because the authority needs to make savings, or the ones who sit on reception dealing with the ever-growing frustrations and queries of the visiting public? Please stop dissembling. Frontline services are only efficient if they have backroom services to call on who deal with the other stuff. Can you imagine having to do without all those ‘backroom’ special advisors?\nFinally there’s the kind of response where you adopt a different tone and blame the Local Authority for a shameful decision: something like “We will hold those local authorities who do not carry out their responsibilities to the most vulnerable in society (them again) to account”. Really? How, exactly? Are you going to take away the party membership of people who actively try to punish people just for being old and frail? Or are you just hoping that we think all they need is a public telling off?\nYou may want to live in a world where only financially well-off people get to keep any dignity in their old age. But I don’t. And I don’t think I know anyone else who does. So please stop pretending that proposals like the one in Tendring are all someone else’s fault. Those local authorities might be wielding the paintbrush, but you’re the one distributing the paint.\nPosted by Mandy Cook on 22 December 2015 at 5:06 pm\nWell said, Emma. You explain the consequences of the government’s financial squeeze on councils very well indeed to Mr Osborne – just in case he really has no idea of the effect of such a policy on people without immediate family, friends or indeed servants (!) It still is an absolutely disgraceful decision on the part of Tendring DC. I hope the voters rise up and oblige their Council to reverse it.",
  "https_emmabishton_wordpress_com/https_emmabishton_wordpress_com_2014_09_30_i-cant-stop-watching-harry-smith/content_26.html": "Anyone following the progress of the Labour Party conference last week will probably have heard of Harry Smith. As he has done in articles before now, Harry Smith successfully articulated what the NHS is for, and why it was set up, with more clarity and meaning than any politician I have ever witnessed. True, he wasn’t charged with presenting any solutions to the finances or other pressures on the NHS. But he did point out very clearly that life before the NHS (and the welfare state) was harsh, inequitable, and sad for very many people, and that the core values of the NHS which brought relief to that suffering are now at risk. I can’t possibly express it any better, I would suggest you watch his speech if you haven’t already.\nMove forward a week and David Cameron’s commitment to the NHS had nothing to do with sparing people from the pain and injustice of a life where dying cancer patients had no access to morphine. Or where even today children born one side of a fence are expected to die a decade or more earlier than those born on the other side of it. His contribution to the politics of the NHS was definitely in the ‘policy nugget for potential voters’ camp, with the promise that people will be able to see their GP seven days a week “at a time that suits them and their family”.\nHis promise does raise a number of rather vexing questions. Like how to manage the GP workforce to meet this demand (which includes the need to train up rather more of them than we’re doing at the moment and the fact that many are highly stressed simply trying to meet today’s obligations). Like how referring people to other bits of the system on a weekend day will help them if no attention is paid to the problems elsewhere in that system. And like the fundamental problem that many of the people who most need better access to healthcare either don’t know when or why they need to go their GP, can’t find one to go to, or need support they just don’t have to adopt lifestyle changes that would improve their life chances. Leaving all these – and many other – questions aside for the moment, Cameron’s announcement is yet another firing round in the ongoing commodification of the NHS.\nHarry Smith (and Andy Burnham, who also does this pretty well) succeeds in describing the NHS as a marker of a compassionate, altruistic society (which, incidentally, is the kind of society I’d like to live in: I imagine you would too). Cameron and his helpers, on the other hand (though this criticism isn’t only directed at Tories), appear to think of healthcare – public or private – as a ‘right’. As in having a right to receive a certain standard of service. And to which, by implication, some people (the hard-working ones) have more right to than others. The message that the NHS is there for people ‘when they need it’ seems to be turning into ‘when they want it’. Need isn’t the same as want, as most parents will probably have said at some point. Reinventing wants as needs for electoral convenience won’t stop that child on the wrong side of the fence dying a decade earlier than the child on the other side.\nHarry Smith belongs to a generation that understands what life was like before the NHS, and why it was needed. I, on the other hand, belong to a generation which expects it to be there. That expectation brings the risk of complacency. Add to that complacency a misplaced focus on ‘rights’ not ‘needs’, and the true value of the NHS can get lost. Earlier this year, the losses and sacrifices of people of Harry Smith’s generation and the one before were being remembered across the country in commemorations of D Day and the start of WWI. But we seem a bit short on learning the lessons of history. Perhaps all our politicians should start by watching Harry Smith.",
  "https_emmabishton_wordpress_com/https_emmabishton_wordpress_com_category_health_page_2/content_64.html": "Yesterday I signed the most recent NHS petition by the highly-organised campaign group 38Degrees against limiting access to GP appointments, joining 189,206 others (at the time of writing). The proposal in question is one which (as reported in The Independent) was circulating last week in the TorySphere as part of a ‘discussion brief’ on healthcare for Conservative activists. Today, Jeremy Hunt, the Secretary of State for Health, has been forced to state that limiting appointments will never become Conservative policy.\nI can’t help wondering whether it was proposed to deflect attention from other more complex proposals, or to make people feel relieved when proposals that would otherwise have been unconscionable are put forward. But supposing it was a serious proposal, it shows little understanding of how or why people use the NHS. Whilst it’s certainly true that the sharp-elbowed are more likely to ‘get their taxes’ worth’ out of their GP than those who are vulnerable, it’s also true that people who are ill visit their GP. Some people are isolated, anxious and depressed, and the GP may not be able to address all of their concerns. But people don’t visit their GP for pleasure: reducing access to GPs could only result in more people turning up at A&E, which would surely be a political own-goal for Mr Hunt!\nWhatever else Mr Hunt proposes for the NHS, he’s got the service at a bit of a crossroads at the moment. During May, as reported in The Guardian, BUPA and other private health firms were granted access to patient-identifiable information for a (relatively small) fee. Yet since the Health and Social Care Act came into effect in April this year, commissioning groups – public sector organisations whose job is to ensure that the public has access to effective and efficient healthcare – have not had access to patient-identifiable data on hospital admissions which would help them monitor and commission care properly.\nThe Primary Care Trusts, which used to commission healthcare, used to have access to this information, but access now depends on information governance arrangements which have yet to be put in place. BUPA might want this information to ‘support the NHS with services like population health management’, but they will be at an unfair advantage if NHS commissioners can’t access the same information.\nWhat does this mean? Does it matter if private companies deliver more of our healthcare providing it’s still free at the point of delivery? I’d say yes. Not just because I don’t see private healthcare companies queuing up to take on the difficult, expensive, and time-consuming cases; not just because it’s hard not to see private healthcare companies adding in charges and forcing a differentiation between those who can afford to pay that little bit more for a decent meal, and those who can’t. But also because it goes against what we as a nation want from our NHS.\nThere has been no better advert for the NHS of late than the BBC series ‘Keeping Britain Alive’. If you haven’t watched it, please try and catch an episode on iPlayer. Despite having worked in the NHS for 20 years, I watched the episodes avidly, and I’m missing my regular appointment with BBC2 on Tuesday evenings. The BBC brought us documentaries which clearly highlighted the way in which the NHS responds to real people, all the time, regardless of circumstance, and often regardless of whether our own lifestyles have contributed to ill-health. They showed the breadth of the service, from neuro-surgery to community care for people with learning disabilities. They also showed its expertise, experience, and humanity.\nI just hope Mr Hunt – and anyone who might consider voting for him in 2015 – was watching.",
  "https_emmabishton_wordpress_com/https_emmabishton_wordpress_com_2021_05_19_singing-is-not-back-but-we-dont-know-why/content_15.html": "I have written to my MP (James Cartlidge, South Suffolk), to enlist his help in understanding why the return of group singing was so unexpectedly cancelled late on Monday. Here’s the letter:\nDear James\nI am writing to ask for your help with an issue that has arisen unexpectedly from new government guidance issued on Monday evening; namely that singing groups have been limited to 6 people indoors. The new guidance singles out singing specifically – whether that be at organised choir rehearsals in Covid-secure venues, or even informal singing at parent and toddler groups (unworkable in that context, I’m sure you’d agree!). This decision to prohibit organised singing for groups of more than 6 is not only inconsistent with previous communications (including the answer given by the Minister for Culture on 27th April to a parliamentary question), but also with other freedoms that have been permitted. It also has a direct impact on my ability to work.\nI appreciate that the research commissioned by DCMS last summer identified risks associated with aerosol production from singing and some instruments. That is why it was followed by guidance about how to sing (or play) safely, taking appropriate action to ensure social distancing, ventilation and so on. The issue here is not whether groups can work with this guidance to plan and deliver choir or group sessions in ways which are as Covid-secure as possible; like choir leaders across the country I have now spent weeks visiting venues, preparing risk assessments and communicating with members of my groups about the actions and approach required for a return to live singing this week. The issue is that we are being barred from putting this work into practice, but it is not clear why.\nAs of Monday, we are permitted to take part in dance classes, group exercise or other indoor sport. Such activities involve exertion, and therefore, one would assume, the production of aerosols. The new guidance suggests that such activities have been deemed less risky than socially distanced singing. But it is not clear how this decision has been arrived at, or what evidence it is based on. I appreciate the concern about the new Indian variant, and that this may lead to changes to the roadmap or local differences. But that alone does not explain why singing should be considered more risky than dancing.\nThe DCMS appears to believe that the non-professional world is somehow a nice optional extra, that exists on its own and can wait for some future relaxation of restrictions. Amateur singing (which the UK is generally considered to excel at) is facilitated by self-employed musicians like myself, and generates income in turn for venues and for musicians to work alongside us. Participants are people from a whole range of life experiences, who come together to sing and through that, to experience a shared sense of belonging, of endeavour, the safe expression of emotions from grief through to joy, and to enjoy the sense of creating something beyond ourselves. And yes, it’s fun. But singing for wellbeing is not a new idea, it is simply a new way of expressing what people have been doing for centuries. Permitting people to exercise indoors for their physical health whilst depriving them of the opportunity to sing for their mental wellbeing seems perverse, when considering the impacts of the last year.\nGroup singing, like dancing, does not readily translate to the online world. After 14 months of silence, I and many thousands of other choir and singing group leaders and participants are keen to understand the basis of the recent and unexpected decision to exclude singing from the list of permitted activities, and to know when we can plan for a return. Please can you raise my concerns with the DCMS.",

Not that long ago it would have been considered remarkable for someone in his situation to live well into their forties – and a century ago life expectancy for someone with Down Syndrome was just 12.\nAlso last week I signed a petition about a severely learning disabled man from Suffolk who has had a stroke, and who was occupying a hospital bed he no longer needed because the local health and social care authorities have not agreed which of them should fund his package of care. His case, sadly, is not unusual. As happens so often, the issue here was whether the man needed ‘nursing’ or ‘social’ care. To most of us this is an abstract and rather meaningless distinction, not least since social care can include carrying out essential health-related tasks which most of us don’t have to do for ourselves, let alone for someone else (injecting insulin, for example). But providing care costs money, both health and social care organisations need to make financial savings, so each wants the other to pay. As the distinction between nursing and social care is often finely drawn even for the professionals, such debates are now protracted and commonplace. The person who needs the care – and their family – are left waiting whilst care is broken down into a series of tasks and an associated set of costs.\nI don’t believe the decision-makers in these or any other health and social care organisations lack empathy or understanding (even though it might seem that way at times). They are required to make objective decisions in the interests of fairness, and to use public resources effectively, and that is what they are seeking to do. But they are hamstrung by inadequate resources, as we don’t place enough value on care work to pay for the levels of care we would ourselves wish to receive.\nCare costs, there is simply no way round this. If we need someone to help us get out of bed in the morning, and (for whatever reason) we don’t have family members who can help us do that, then that carer needs paying. (And even so, many carers who help people to live are not themselves earning a living wage, nor do they often have time to provide companionship and social support to the people they care for.) As we constantly hear in any debates about the future of healthcare, we live in an ageing society. For people with learning disabilities that means they will often outlive their family carers – or that their physical care needs will become impossible for family carers to deliver. And, due to the complex nature of their disabilities, that care may be complicated to plan and deliver. But that doesn’t mean they should be subjected to abstract debates about the nature of care. Perpetuating the ongoing division between nursing and social care just makes work for the organisations involved, wastes hospital beds, and leaves the cared-for person – and their family – adrift in the system. People who need care are entitled to it, whatever it is called. It’s time we gave them the dignity of paying for it.\nPosted by Chris Clark on 25 May 2015 at 9:37 am\nVery well said, Emma. One of my sisters has Retts: she’s over 50, which is extraordinary, a testimony to the quality of care she’s received, albeit supplemented by regular visits and timely interventions by my parents. I once worked for just a week in her hospital – I was exhausted, physically & mentally, the pay packet unexpectedly light. Most of the patients were discharged to “community homes” in the 1980s and the land sold off for “executive housing”. The more problematic patients, like my sister, had to be moved to special facilities, that cost more to run but evidently not in terms of salaries for the carers. In my opinion, they can’t be paid enough for their constant diligence.",

  "https_emmabishton_wordpress_com/https_emmabishton_wordpress_com_2016_03_28_dear-nicky-morgan/content_31.html": "I have been reading your interview with the Guardian on Friday, and I’m concerned and not a little bit angry. Many of the views you expressed in your interview, and the related proposals in your recent White Paper, don’t make sense to me as a parent.\nAlong with millions of others in England, I’m both a parent of school-aged children and a taxpayer. I therefore have not just a personal interest in my children’s education but a vested interest in the whole system working effectively. In contrast you seem to think of us parents as passive bystanders about what happens in our schools. I am sure you, as a parent, would consider yourself to have the skills required to be an effective governor, and thus an interest in school structures. This is true for me, and for all the parents I know who are governors. So I’m unsure why you are seeking to antagonise parents across the country by suggesting otherwise. It’s hard to escape the conclusion that you are mostly concerned with removing power from local people.\nI have been a school governor (not, as it happens, a parent-governor), so I know from personal experience that even a few years ago, governors were expected to be able to accommodate and interpret large volumes of data and complex policy detail and still be good communicators and ambassadors for their school. I also know that at times, parents in general can have unrealistic expectations of schools (and schooling) or just be downright annoying. But we also have an emotional investment in our local schools which is, for example, what motivates parent school associations to raise thousands across the country to complement educational provision and to help with reading in the classroom – signs of a collaborative relationship which I would have expected you to support.\nIn your plans you to force all schools to become academies, you suggest that neither parents nor the local authority should retain any formal relationship with our schools. But if you remove us from formal involvement in our schools, how do you expect us to feel sufficiently invested in the system to retain these informal support mechanisms? Furthermore, you seem to be expecting the local authority, stripped of all responsibility, power or resources for overseeing our local schools, to bounce back from such a hammering so that it can actively “champion the rights of parents” (your words not mine). I would really appreciate an explanation of how this is going to work in practice, and what difference it will make either to parents or to schools. (Incidentally, I understand that one of your proposals is to pay some governors. Why not just carry on paying the local authority to run a service across schools – surely that would be more efficient, and less subject to conflicts of interest?)\nMy son’s secondary school recently became an academy because it became clear that the local authority had retained neither the financial nor human resources to provide an effective school support service. It made the move, presumably having seen the writing on the wall, giving it the freedom at least to choose a local trust which actively seeks to promote collaboration between its schools. But my daughter’s primary school is not an academy, nor does it have any reason – or desire – to become one. It is a successful local school, rated outstanding, and with firm roots in our local community and widespread participation in music and sports – the kind of activities that make our children’s experience of school positive instead of it an endless battery of tests. (Believe me, this positive experience is important; my daughter finds the tests very stressful even though she’s pretty good at them). Her school is already free to make effective choices about how it budgets for and teaches the personal, literacy, mathematical and enquiring skills that children need to be equipped with on leaving primary school. As a parent, I like the choices my daughter’s school makes now. What benefits do you anticipate would flow from forcing her school down a path it clearly doesn’t need?\nI imagine that both of these schools would appreciate the increase in funding that would result from the fair funding proposals in the White Paper, as Suffolk is one of the 40 lowest funded authorities (per pupil). But in seeking to implement this proposal without addressing the funding gap, you are simply proposing to drag down schools elsewhere to increase the funding for mine, and set groups of us parents against each-other. As antagonistic practices go, it is exceeded only by the statement that really made me angry in your Guardian interview, and which seems to have given you licence to pursue the plans in your White Paper: apparently we parents are insufficiently interested in education for it to be a campaign issue. Apparently we just don’t care enough. Really? And that’s why the forced academisation of schools wasn’t in the Conservative Manifesto? That’s a very scary statement for a government to make – and doesn’t exactly sound rooted in the kind of empirical evidence you apparently want to see underpinning our education system.\nIn producing a manifesto and choosing what to talk about on national media you have plenty of opportunities to influence those doorstep conversations. It speaks volumes about how you view the electorate that you chose not to indicate what you were planning to do you our schools, and our school system, in the election campaign. You feared the outcome if people had know the plans – rather like those NHS ‘reforms’ that were denied and lied about in the 2010 campaign.\nWe parents are emotionally invested in our children’s education, but we are not stupid, blinkered or unreasonable. Your communications have done nothing to explain why you are keener to pursue an ideological change, with no clear benefits to our education system, than to support the system and its users to pursue a rounded, meaningful and useful education for our children. I can’t tell if you intentionally set out to antagonise parents with your proposals or whether we are just collateral damage. Either way, you are setting us up to fight (alongside teachers and school leaders) for the resources and organisational structures that can most efficiently, fairly and effectively make that education happen. If that’s what you want, you’re on.\nPosted by agwhyte on 29 March 2016 at 10:08 pm\nAs a former LEA chair in another F40 authority, the other aspect of this exercise that makes me bool with fury is the fact that in the 90s when funding was least generous, in common with many other LEAs, we spent far more on education than we were ever given by government. I don’t see councils being prepared to do anything if future governments of whatever Colour reduce funding for academies.\nI also don’t see how DofE is going to get their hands on CofE schools without confiscating church assets\nPosted by Emma Bishton on 25 April 2016 at 9:00 am\nWell I have a reply (in my direct letter I tweaked the last couple of lines slightly but otherwise the letter was as set out here). I note that the DfE say they would welcome my comments. I’m not sure they would.\nDear Ms Bishton\nI am writing on behalf of the Secretary of State to thank you for your email of 7 April about your concerns with proposals in the White Paper.\nI note the points you raise however can clarify the government are not banning parents from governance. We recognise and strongly welcome the valuable contribution that parents can make to effective governance. High quality governance is vital for the success of an autonomous school led system.\nEngaging with parents and others to understand their views and needs is vital for effective governance, but it is not the same thing as governance. All parents need a voice, and this government is actually increasing academies’ engagement with parents. For the first time we will create an expectation that every academy puts in place arrangements for meaningful engagement with all parents, and to listen to their views and feedback.\nMany parents will have valuable skills that make them very effective governors and boards are and will continue to be free to appoint them as they see fit. We are clear that academies do not need to reserve places on the board for parents, simply because they are parents, so we are ending our requirement on them to do so. Many Multi Trust Academies (MATs) are already focusing their school level bodies on parental engagement, leaving the board free to focus on fully skills-based governance.\nWe do recognise there are specific challenges for primary schools and will provide them with tailored support in the process by guidance and evidence based ‘how-to’ tools and case studies of best practice. We will also look to strong organisations already operating in the sector to help build capacity.\nMATs particularly cross-phase ones will be crucial to the long-term success of primary schools in a fully academised system as they stand to benefit financially, educationally and in governance terms from these arrangements. MATs can offer schools significant benefits in staffing and leadership, with improved career opportunities and support for teachers and leaders, excellent practice in teaching and curriculum, more robust governance and more efficient back-office arrangements that free up more funding for the classroom.\nIn contrast to relying on the ability of the local authority to improve their schools, full academisation will mean that all schools will be part of a dynamic system in which underperformance can be addressed decisively by removing and replacing those in control of schools. Local authorities have clear interests and responsibilities which mean they need to represent the interests of pupils and parents such as:\n· ensuring the admissions process is well co-ordinated and fair.\n· where children have special educational needs, they are responsible for assessing their needs and ensuring that they can attend the school which best meets them.\n· They have clear safeguarding responsibilities for all children regardless of where they are educated.\n· For children in care to act as a “corporate parent” with a duty to promote their education achievement and progress.\nLocal authorities will continue to retain their existing statutory levers in these areas and will continue to receive funding to cover the costs of delivering them.\nI hope the information is helpful.\nYour correspondence has been allocated reference number xxxxx. If you need to respond to us, please visit: https://www.education.gov.uk/contactus and quote your reference number.\nAs part of our commitment to improving the service we provide to our customers, we are interested in hearing your views and would welcome your comments via our website at: https://www.education.gov.uk/pctsurvey.\nYours sincerely",
  "https_emmabishton_wordpress_com/https_emmabishton_wordpress_com_category_musings-on-education_page_2/content_86.html": "I sent this letter to Tristram Hunt, the shadow education secretary, earlier today, and will of course update the blog once I have a reply. I’ll expand more on what I mean by principles and overview on subsequent posts.\nDear Mr Hunt\nI’m writing to express my concern about the policy intentions you published over the weekend. I’m sure I won’t be the first Labour Party member writing to you today, or the last parent to express such views.\nI don’t know the policy detail. What I do know is that things are in a mess, and that education policies which appear – at least on the face of it – designed to appeal to a small group of potential voters, won’t sort out the structural and systemic problems in our education system.\nAs you know, there are, sadly, examples throughout the country of education provision in distress. Here in Suffolk we’ve seen at first hand the wasteful and divisive effects of Free Schools, and also have the misfortune to be home to the first for-profit school, widely rumoured to be about to be given a bad Ofsted. Granted, these schools were set up in a fit of ideological pique, despite a wealth of evidence about the surplus of school places in Suffolk and the need to support other school changes already underway in our county. But sorting out the mess that has been left behind doesn’t just mean stopping unqualified teachers from working in state-funded schools of any sort, or ceasing the Free School programme (welcome though both of these statements are). It needs something bigger, surely?\nThe NHS has in its time been subject to countless structural changes, as you well know, and none more damaging to its identity, equity of provision and service culture than that imposed by the Coalition in 2010. But having a clear structure should not be in itself damaging, it’s the constant twisting and turning that causes the harm. Conversely, education has seen the opposite: no structural overview, dwindling accountability to local people, and a blurring of boundaries between providers and commissioners (the rise of the academy chain). To make matters worse, there is Michael Gove’s pervasive assault on the motivation of teachers and the optimism of parents.\nWe talk about our ‘education system’. But in reality, it’s a series of mini-systems, most of which don’t join up, and many of which have competing priorities. So faced with all this chaos, why isn’t Labour trying to sort out the fundamentals? Why, instead, do we have to be subject to more statements about micro-policies such as how long to teach maths for (isn’t that a professional decision, not a political one, by the way?), and why do we have to keep pandering to the notion of choice for some (Fraser Nelson’s ‘pent-up’ parents), rather than making sure every parent’s children can attend a good local school? You have made some positive statements – for example about valuing vocational training, and supporting the establishment of a Royal College of Teaching, but it seems to me that such messages are in danger of getting lost in the storm.\nI fully understand that getting from where we are now to a more equitable and confident system will take considerable planning, effort and time. I’m a parent, not an expert, and I only have some idea of the policies you wish to pursue. But I do believe fundamental change can and must be achieved. I appreciate some of the debate is tough: we are where we are now, as they say. But first teachers need to trust you. Parents need to trust you. And so do our children. So please, open up the debate and make it about the principles and the overview first, the detail can follow.\nYours sincerely\nEmma Bishton",
  "https_emmabishton_wordpress_com/https_emmabishton_wordpress_com_2014_09_10_everyone-is-entitled-to-their-own-opinion-just-not-their-own-facts/content_69.html": "Recently, and despite being a lifelong Labour voter, I filled in a public survey from the Conservative party about priorities for policy development. (It is, after all, not just Tory supporters who are affected by Tory policies). Leaving aside the merits or otherwise of doing this, I’ve noticed an unwelcome – if not unpredictable – consequence: my inbox has since been littered with Tory party emails asking me for donations. The most recent of these came from Nicky Morgan, the education secretary tasked with being Gove-lite (but more polite).\nMs Morgan makes a number of assertions (all of which I notice are attributed to the Conservatives, not to the Coalition). Not only are the Tories apparently recruiting “the best teachers”, they are also, it seems, working with school heads to ‘restore discipline and improve standards’. They’re opening a record number of new schools and ensuring that 80,000 more children are starting secondary school with a ‘good understanding of English & Maths than under Labour’ (under whom school standards fell, they report).\nNone of these statements are accompanied by any evidence, nor even any reference to any evidence. No examples or details are given, and there are no links to sources of information. There’s not even a heart-warming anecdote in sight. Evidence can of course be inconvenient to politicians of all stripes, but appearing to do without it altogether suggests to me that that Ms Morgan neither values evidence, nor expects anyone else to do so. Gone is spin, in comes proselytising. There is a particular irony here: the party hoping that we’ll not notice the lack of evidence in their educational sales pitch is the same one that demands more rigour from pupils and teachers. That’s the same rigour which (in my dictionary anyway) is defined as extremely thorough and accurate.\nHowever, I shouldn’t trouble myself with such matters. Apparently all I need to do to “play my part” in this success story is donate £20. Today. (Which, incidentally, is a lot more than the Labour party requests of its supporters). Can’t think what’s stopping me…",
  "https_emmabishton_wordpress_com/https_emmabishton_wordpress_com_tag_free-schools/content_94.html": "In thinking more about how to measure schools, and what should be measured, I’ve been looking through a couple of existing websites dedicated to reviewing schools – Schools.net and The Good Schools Guide. The latter follows a set procedure and reviews schools – mostly independent schools – from a parent perspective, and looks at the school as a whole, rather than just at academic results. Schools.net, on the other hand, is an open space where parents or others can submit reviews of schools they know – as there is no set review procedure these reflect personal experiences. These websites clearly serve a market, and it’s good that parents should get more of a feel for the schools they are considering than can ever be gained from reading an Ofsted report or a league table. The problem with these sites for me, though, is that they start from the assumption that as parents we should be ‘shopping around’ for the right school for our children. Shopping around makes sense when paying for a private education – in the same way that it makes sense when choosing a house to live in. And it is of course true that each school (whether state or private) has its own culture and all children are different – so by implication, some children will thrive more easily in some schools than in others. But is extending the choice of schools available really the answer to making sure that our state schools can provide most effectively and consistently for our children?\nIt seems to me that pursuing Choice as driver of the system just increases people’s dissatisfaction with the provision which already exists, by making us focus on what we might have, rather than on whether what we are offered is appropriate. I appreciate that one of the reasons for pursuing increased choice in the system is to increase diversity of provision and raise standards through encouraging people to engage more with the services they are using. But by definition, an education system cannot provide an tailored individual experience for each child; yet proposing a consumer model makes us expect just that and feel dissatisfied when what we want is not available. No-where is this dissatisfaction – and its consequences – clearer than in Suffolk.\nEducation results in Suffolk – both at Key stage 2 and at GCSE – have been considerably below where they might reasonably be expected to be, given the demographics of Suffolk, for some time now – as any follower of the local media will be aware. There is much speculation as to why; reasons put forward (singly or as contributing factors) include low funding per capita, low aspiration (parental and school), poor LEA leadership, the 3-tier school structure (primary, middle and upper schools). Alongside repeating that “it is not good enough” (as if stating the obvious actually facilitates improvement), the LEA have responded to this position by effecting the wholesale (and largely unpopular) closure of middle schools, and commissioning the RSA to lead a review.\nSet school performance in Suffolk against the national political backdrop of constant denigration of our schools, and the result is fairly widespread anxiety amongst parents whose children are yet to go through school. The consequence here in Suffolk? Twenty bids to the DfE to set up free schools, over three ‘waves’ of applications (one special school – which is needed – has been approved as have four 11-16 schools in the grounds of former middle schools – all additional provision). Note this figure does not include any bids submitted in the 2013 application round, and one (a Steiner-influenced school) is now on its fourth bid to the DfE. These bids are all on the the list finally published by the DfE last week, as a result of the British Humanist Association’s persistent efforts to force the DfE to act more transparently in regard to free school applications. To put this in context, there was only one free school proposal for Essex (which also has below-average GCSE performance) over the same time period.\nBy any standards, this is a high level of free school activity in a county with an ageing population and a large surplus of school places already. And all these proposals do (bar those for special/alternative provision) is extend choice for parents. They make no attempt to improve the system as a whole (this is not their intention, I appreciate). Nor, as I’ve outlined previously on this blog, do they provide the kind of breadth of educational offer that will provide our children with the choices they need. Instead they seek to provide brief respite for a minority of parents in this dissatisfied world where the expression of the right for individual choice obscures what it is that we really need our school system to deliver, and how to achieve it.\nTurning back to my starting point, I can’t help thinking that we are setting our schools up to fail before we have even started, by reducing discussion about them to a narrow set of criteria which are fairly easily measurable – and rarely placing this in context anyway. Existing schools can fail to live up to expectation in accordance with the measured criteria, but new schools and proposed schools have no track record on these same criteria so can’t fail. And, except for those few state schools which have been reviewed by the Good Schools Guide, there’s no other point of reference in reports currently that enables us to understand something of the experience of being at a particular school and how our local school compares on these grounds with other schools. The result, in Suffolk at least, is more parents seeking personalised provision, but no more clarity about why our existing schools aren’t living up to expectation or how to help them do so. I believe that if we were having a proper debate about what our existing local schools do (in total, not just in tests) and how we as parents contribute to our children’s schools to increase our satisfaction with them, we would then be monitoring our schools to ensure that they are delivering what is needed – not finding reasons for going elsewhere.",
  "https_emmabishton_wordpress_com/https_emmabishton_wordpress_com_2014_09_19_assessing-the-dfes-listening-skills/content_44.html": "In their wisdom, the DfE have set out content for study at music GCSE and A Level which appears incompatible with the criteria they also wish to adopt. And which would lessen both the appeal and the relevance of these qualifications. Go to the Protect Music Education campaign pages for more information. Here’s my response:\nDear Department for Education and Ofqual,\nI am responding to the Department for Education’s consultation on GCSE and A level reform in respect of the subject content for music, and the Ofqual consultation on Developing new GCSE, A-level and AS qualifications for first teaching in 2016 in respect of the subject criteria for music.\nI am not a teacher. However, I can see that much of the subject content is inconsistent with many of the aims and objectives set out in the subject criteria established by Ofqal. Incompatibility of content with criteria is undesirable for any qualification in any subject at any level. The Incorporated Society of Musicians, on behalf of the music community, has set out the inconsistencies and shown the ways in which the proposed subject content would limit both the rigour and the relevance of GCSE music as a qualification. As they state, the Aims & Objectives set out by Ofqual and the Department for Education are excellent but it is not clear how these are going to be achieved by the proposed content. Music is a discipline focused on processes, so, for example, focusing on ‘musical language’ as opposed to ‘musical skills’, or ‘a composition’ rather than ‘composing’, increases the risk that pupils can be taught to pass a test rather than to develop essential musical skills; this would do neither them, nor the examination’s credibility, any favours.\nThe proposed subject content appears at odds with the programme for the National Curriculum at key stages 1,2 and 3. If from Year 1 to Year 9 students are to appreciate a broad range of musical styles, genres and traditions, why then is GCSE study limited to a rather arbitrary 200 year window in only one tradition? As an A-level student in the 1980s, I studied a work in depth from the twentieth century (Bartok’s Music for Strings, Percussion and Celeste), a work which has stayed with me to this day (and engaged me far more than the romantic work by Tchaikowsky that I studied at O-level). My musical education was fairly narrow in that it was limited to Western classical music. But within this limitation, it had great depth. I was very fortunate to have school music teachers interested, able and allowed to teach music from across the centuries, but with a very particular focus on the twentieth century. These teachers, who were free to teach to their strengths and their pupils’ interests (in both the general curriculum and examinations) have had a very significant influence on the musical choices and skills I have since developed, and on my desire to be actively involved as a musician in my children’s schools.\nIn short, I am concerned that music, despite its importance to individuals and to the economy, is already a niche subject at GCSE and A-level. By introducing unnecessary restrictions on the genres, styles and traditions that can be studied, these proposals seem to me likely to reduce the appeal of music qualifications even more. That is not in the interests of pupils, examination boards, the music profession or the music industry.\nI support the core changes put forward by the National Association of Music in Higher Education, the Music Education Council, and the Incorporated Society of Musicians. In the interests of future generations of musicians and music-lovers, as well as of the music industry, I hope that you will incorporate their recommendations in full.\nYours sincerely\nEmma Bishton",
  "https_emmabishton_wordpress_com/https_emmabishton_wordpress_com_2017_11_12_worlds-apart/content_3.html": "There’s a group of lively and engaging teenagers in my sitting room. Eating pizzas, cake, watching random stuff on the television and generally making a lot of noise (some of which could be called singing). They are celebrating with my eldest, who turned sixteen this week. Those sixteen years have gone in a flash, as they do for most parents I know. And like most parents of sixteen-year olds, we’ve negotiated ‘wants’ versus ‘needs’ many times so far.\nOn his birthday, as has become my habit over the last sixteen or so years, I fell asleep in front of the television. This time, I woke up to the BBC programme Exodus, a series which follows individuals on their journey as migrants and refugees. The BBC describes it as a “terrifying, intimate, epic portrait of the migrant crisis”, and they aren’t wrong. On this particular episode we met young men living in disused train carriage in Serbia, whose daily reality it is to live in the kind of dark, inhospitable conditions used to portray fear and lawlessness in western TV dramas. Many of these young men huddled around a makeshift fire to combat the ice on the ground were not much older than my sixteen-year old. But they were fending for themselves with no kitchen, toilet or lightbulb in sight.\nIn the same episode, we also met a couple and their two children, living in a container in a refuge camp in Greece. It’s hard to imagine a container made to look more homely. But it was still a container. In a camp with no school, and no future. The mother, Nazifa, was six months pregnant. Her goal was to reach Germany, so that her third child could be born there. In this episode she was agonising about the possibility of having to make the journey alone, as they couldn’t afford to pay the smuggler for her to take either or both of her children. Her choice: to leave her two children behind and make the uncertain journey alone, to split the family and take one child, or to remain with her family and give up the chance to change their lives forever.\nWe watched Nazifa sing her toddler to sleep. Watching her made me smile, and made me cry. Singing a child to sleep is the kind of intimate everyday act most of us parents have enjoyed – and taken for granted – countless times. But unlike Nazifa I’ve never been forced to choose between my children. I’ve never had to fear them living alone in a dark disused railway siding in the snow. And I’ve never had to consider leaving my children behind.\nThe BBC describes Exodus as epic. ‘Epic’ is a strange word. We use it of films, of drama, of stories. To mean a story beyond what is normally contemplated or imaginable. And generally, of course, to mean something made up. But Exodus isn’t made up. It’s about real people, who but for a bit of luck or a change of circumstance could be living lives just like mine and my son’s. I cannot imagine having the courage to do as they have done, but then I haven’t had to flee war, hunger, oppression and daily violence just to stand a chance of staying alive.\nExodus tells the story of just a few of the people caught up in the refugee and migrant crisis across the world. Underlying these stories is a huge, unravelling crisis with no end in sight. I don’t know what the answers are to the refugee and migrant crisis. But I do know that leaving people to fend for themselves in unheated train carriages in the snow, or depriving young children of their mothers, is wrong. Watching programmes like Exodus doesn’t of course address the problem, and also runs the risk of turning the lives of real people into epic stories we can observe not actively participate in. But it is a story that needs to be told, if more mothers are to have a chance of meeting the basic needs of their children as they turn sixteen.",

As has become the norm in any commentary about education these days, the discussion moved from the merits of the changes to GCSE marking to the choice of subjects being studied, and on to the customarily shrill debate about whether ‘the system’ as a whole needs to be changed, yet again. And from one panellist came the familiar assertion that ‘the system is clearly failing so should be reformed’.\nGovernment and media reports and neighbourhood conversations about schools are polarised. Schools are either labelled ‘excellent’ (albeit rarely these days) or ‘failing’ – an emotive term unlikely to instil anything but fear or despair in most parents and teachers. But this ‘system’ contains not only the schools (there are more than 24,000 in England alone not to mention other aspects such as pre-school provision, alternative provision and Local Education Authorities), but also the complex rules which govern what happens in them – exams, curriculum etc. And it’s a system which operates in, and seeks to mitigate, an unequal world – otherwise all children would enter the system with the same chances of success, which they don’t.\nSo just as with any other large entity, it’s quite likely that at any one time, not everything is working as well as it might. This isn’t an excuse for failure, but a plea for a broader perspective. Allowing ‘the system’ as a whole to be rubbished just increases the anxiety for parents that their children will be failed by it – not a promising start for any child as parents should be encouraged to engage in their children’s schooling, not spending all their time worrying or looking for other schools. Why politicians and pundits think that it makes sense to both exhort parents to support their children in their schooling and spend considerable effort rubbishing the exams those children will take or the schools they will take them in, I don’t understand. They may do either with good intent, but the resultant conflict just creates confusion for parents.\nSo what should the system be doing? Ensuring that all children can access a well-rounded education which equips them to be adult citizens (which is not at all the same thing as all pupils getting A grades in lots of GCSEs). ‘The system’ might be better placed to do this if it were properly supported to identify and address any issues from within (as the Heads Roundtable have been doing for the last few months), not being constantly subjected to change from the outside.\nWhen the people in the education system are busy either making or rebutting charges of failure, the system as a whole is distracted from identifying and addressing those aspects which are not working as well as they need to.\nSo instead, as we approach a new school year, why can’t we start focusing on the things that do work, and on helping spread such good practice across the system? Talk the system up instead of down. Take some of the fear and despair out, and we as parents might feel a bit more like stakeholders, a bit less like puppets, and a bit more able to support our children through their school life.",
  "https_emmabishton_wordpress_com/https_emmabishton_wordpress_com_2016_03_22_one-biscuit-at-a-time/content_67.html": "Last Saturday evening we observed Earth Hour at home, doing dishes and playing a board game by candlelight with no recourse to anything electronic. All (except possibly the dishes) very sociable and cosy, no distractions from buzzing mobiles etc. Our quiet domestic effort was rather in contrast to the habit of international governments and big business these days which rather ostentatiously celebrate EarthHour with iconic pictures of dark cityscapes and the like. Whilst I don’t doubt their good intentions, you do rather get the sense that it is something to be seen to be doing (and therefore definitely not something to be avoiding). Businesses and governments wish to be seen (in the main) as responsible organisations, husbanding the world’s precious resources in our interests. But there is a bigger point to EarthHour. However much electricity we saved for an hour last Saturday evening, there’s really not much point if it doesn’t prompt us – as individuals, companies or governments, to try to reduce our electricity consumption for the other 8759 hours in the year. EarthHour is a small step taken in recognition of the beauty of our planet and the need to conserve its resources in our own interest, but even single steps need a destination.\nEarthHour is well advertised (for free) on large hoardings and through the media. Rather less visible are the campaigns to persuade business to take action against the deforestation due to mass production of palm oil.\nI’ve just signed a Greenpeace petition asking companies that use palm-oil (particularly three named multi-nationals: PepsiCo, Johnson& Johnson and Colgate-Palmolive) to improve their act on where and how they source palm oil, and how transparent they are about it. In the grand scheme of things we have to worry about, palm oil doesn’t sound all that important – or indeed all that exciting. It is a remarkably useful and ubiquitous substance used in up to half our household products.(Ironically it appears that you are as likely to find it in your toothpaste as in the biscuits you are seeking to protect your teeth from.) And it makes such products much cheaper to produce in large quantities. All that is needed for fast and large-scale production of palm-oil is heat and water – two substances naturally available in the world’s rainforests.\nBut growing it fast enough to respond to the demands of profit-motivated companies requires not just heat and water but cheap labour, making governments in some of the worlds poorer countries prey to the profit-motives of multi-national companies. So in the name of increased economic activity, rainforests are ransacked (well actually burnt to the ground), their inhabitants uprooted – with resulting risks of exploitation and child labour. The impact of rapid growth in large-scale production so far is that 90% of orang-utan habitats have been destroyed in the last 20 years, and Indonesia (a country you wouldn’t otherwise expect to be near the top of this particular league table) the third highest emitter of green-house gases in the world. The countries that use large quantities of palm oil – which include the US and the UK, don’t of course have any rainforests of their own. I can’t help feeling that if rainforests were as visible as, say, our stately homes, companies might get away with rather less than they do now.\n‘So what?’, you might say, ‘orang-utans are less important that humans and anyway we are protecting their future through breeding them in captivity’. Well I suppose that depends on your perspective, but what we often fail to notice is that what is bad for orangutans in the wild is also bad for humans. Left in zoos, orang-utans can’t contribute to the eco-system, and nor can all the other less famous (or attractive) inhabitants of the rainforest which are now threatened with extinction within the next few years. And – contrary to what we might like to think – climate change is a problem for us here and now. Rainforests without trees catch fire, increasing CO2 levels which impacts on rising sea-levels which in turn increase flooding across the world, including here in the UK. If we have wait for big business to pay enough tax from increased profits from biscuits and toothpaste in order that governments have the funds to buy more sandbags, we’ll all be losing out. As environmental scientist Carolyn Roberts, talking on BBC Radio 4’s “The Life Scientific” said this morning, when discussing our short-termist response to flood management in the UK: long-term action is essential because there is only one planet, and it has “no emergency exit”.\nPalm-oil seems to be me to be one of those small areas, like running fewer lights, where the actions of individuals can make a difference. (We do, after all, buy the products it is produced for). I know there is a view that signing petitions is a rather pointless activity, more likely to give the signatory a brief boost of morale than to effect real changes in policy. But arguably, petitions to businesses whose sole raison d’être is to sell us stuff, may have more effect. What business, after all, wants to be clearly identified on social media with practices which promote child labour, burn trees and destroy large numbers of cuddly-looking apes? These businesses are so vast that a few people choosing not to buy one of Colgate’s 44 types of toothpaste (yes really) won’t have much effect on them in time to save the rainforests. So whatever else you think about petitions, or about Greenpeace, I urge you, please, to take that step and sign.",
  "https_emmabishton_wordpress_com/https_emmabishton_wordpress_com_2016_09_14_a-sweet-in-every-layer/content_29.html": "I like the sound of my own opinions. (A characteristic that I imagine to be common to most bloggers.) But I do find it depressing to find myself opining repeatedly on policies causing anxiety, frustration and concern to the majority, especially when the available evidence supports a different policy-course altogether. Such frustration has clearly been felt by academics, commentators, politicians and teachers long-opposed to a return to selection and grammar schools, as news of Theresa May’s desire for more grammar schools has filled the airwaves for the last week. (On the plus side, she has succeeded in creating some unity across political divides and amongst the educational establishment!)\nEven the BBC, normally so anxious to produce two sides to a policy argument (even when that leads to completely lopsided arguments being presented as if opinion was equally divided), had to portray Theresa May’s stance as politically-motivated rather than arguable on the basis of evidence. That’s because the evidence clearly shows that selection at 11 does not improve educational attainment across the system, nor does it advance social mobility. Grammar schools are good at stretching the pupils who attend them, not at improving the life chances of those who don’t.\nTheresa May has been very clever. She is portraying ‘meritocracy’ as somehow intrinsic to our sense of ‘British values’ (whatever they are). And she is banking on the assumption that we Brits, supposedly, care more about potential than reality. In her world of potential, every ‘deserving’ child could get a place in the grammar school; in the real world, of course, the majority will be rejected. Like the Free Schools debacle, where increasing the choice of schools is presented as more relevant than improving all schools, this is a policy for parents, not for pupils. In another similarity, it’s very difficult to see how a return to selection is practically possible outside large towns and cities, unless all schools are suddenly to be provided with the additional resources required to bus children from one market town to another. I’ve got to hand it to Mrs May (and to Justine Greening, who as Education Secretary is the person actually charged with trying to make it happen): so far they’ve managed to talk about returning to a pass/fail system as if it’s an ‘everyone gets a prize’ system. As if their new selection system will be like the modern version of pass-the-parcel where there’s a sweet in every layer, rather than one single prize in the very middle of the parcel like there was when I was a child.\nEducation isn’t a prize. Or it shouldn’t be. It’s a right. Leaving aside the arguments in favour of a comprehensive system from an educational and social perspective, there’s a far more simple problem Mrs May could have chosen to address: there simply isn’t enough money in the system right now for all schools to provide that basic educational right for their pupils in a way which actually meets their needs. Structural changes cost money (ask the NHS), as well as creating uncertainty for staff and children. If she really believes all children really do deserve a good education, surely the target for her limited resources should be improving the educational and life chances of ALL the children in the poorest areas, not just the academically gifted ones?\nI passed the eleven-plus, being in the last year group in Somerset to go through selection, and I got a good education in a school that was half grammar, half private (that being the kind of compromise that school systems had to make in rural areas). My children are getting a good education now – but in a properly comprehensive school which doesn’t educate them at the expense of their peers, like mine did. For all the attempts at assuring us that the new policy will not result in the same two-tier system that operated when grammar schools were last commonplace, it is impossible to see how this could actually be done in practice given the limited resources available.\nRant nearly over for now, though doubtless set to be repeated over the coming weeks. One more point for now: the White Paper on education that was published earlier this year included, amongst the chaos of mass-academisation, the proposal that teachers do not need to be qualified. Quite where the White Paper sits in Justine Greening’s in-tray is currently unclear, but if the proposals in it carry on through parliament, we are left with the very real possibility that not only will many schools be losing funding under the new funding formula – in addition to the financial squeeze all schools are under anyway – some schools will be employing unqualified teachers. (And I’ll bet it won’t be the selective ones.) So much for improving our education system. If they carry on like this, there won’t be a parcel to pass around at all.",
  "https_emmabishton_wordpress_com/https_emmabishton_wordpress_com_page_3/content_11.html": "Having had her thunder – and her policy agenda – neatly stolen by Teresa May’s pronouncements on extending grammar schools before she had even time to get her feet under her new desk, Justine Greening has finally produced some policy of her own. On Tuesday she announced some changes to primary school assessment tests (the dreaded SATs). My daughter did SATs earlier this year, and I was one of many who were unhappy enough with SATs and their impact on children and schools that I considered withdrawing her from school during SATS week, so I was interested to hear what she had to say.\nJustine Greening’s announcement included the welcome withdrawal of the threat that children who had been deemed to ‘fail’ their SATs would have to resit them in year 7, and the equally welcome statement that the KS1 spelling and grammar test remains voluntary (though quite who would volunteer to do such a test is beyond me!). She announced that a review of primary assessment is needed and forward-promoted a consultation into primary school assessment which will start in the spring, and that meanwhile there will be no new tests introduced before the 2018-19 academic year.\nSuch stability might sound like a good thing, but that still leaves thousands of pupils and primary schools facing an every-narrowing curriculum and unnecessary, stressful tests for the next two years at least, in order to carry on jumping through a series of hoops of the DfE’s choosing. (After all, if a week is a long time in politics, a year is an eternity for a 10 year old.) That is more than a shame, when she could have taken the opportunity to suspend SATS altogether given that they are not actually about pupils at all, they’re a means of manufacturing school league tables.\nUnlike her predecessors, Michael Gove and Nicky Morgan, who given to zealously issuing edicts, Justine Greening clearly has a more conciliatory, listening tone. And in acknowledging that a review of primary school assessment is needed, she appears to question, at the very least, the merit of some of the policy that she has inherited. But in announcing that the DfE will launch a consultation, she’s missed a opportunity. That the DfE will be involved in such a consultation suggests that she shares her predecessors’ enthusiasm for micro-management and policy leadership in an area where there is no shortage of actual independent experts who are willing and able to provide appropriate guidance for politicians to act on. The Headteachers Roundtable, for instance, have already gone to the bother of producing an alternative education Green Paper which neatly explains why using pupil assessment to measure school performance is a bad idea, and proposes alternative solutions for both pupil assessment and school accountability, I hope she already has a well-worn copy of that on her desk. (As yet the Green Paper doesn’t come with a summary, let alone one aimed at parents rather than headteachers, so I recommend a large coffee before starting to read it!)\nI don’t know whether Justine Greening is already talking to the Headteachers Roundtable. But she does say that she is interested in talking to parents, as well as teachers and unions (though no mention of experts, interestingly). I just hope she doesn’t cherry-pick her parents.\nLast month saw the launch of a new educational ‘campaign’ called Parents and Teachers for Excellence. Now I think you’d struggle to find parents or teachers who were against excellence, so even to the vaguely cynical the group already sounds like an exercise in spin. But if you take a closer look, you’ll find that this apparently ‘non-partisan’ group which claims to be separate to the Westminster elite appears to be nothing but a soft mouthpiece for Conservative education ‘reformers’. (Of the 29 people on its advisory group, only 4 are listed as parents, CEOs or other leaders in Academy chains figure prominently, and the group includes the governments’ ‘Behaviour Tsar’ as well as a former education advisor to the prime minister). It doesn’t look very independent to me.\nThe group describes itself as a campaign seeking an evidence-based approach to education. I’m with them on that, but only if they start off from a neutral position, not from a perspective that uses ideological assumptions as if they were some kind of truth. In my dictionary, non-partisan means not taking sides. Yet the stated starting position for this group is that they already know free schools and academies “work”. (Oh and behaviour policies, knowledge-based curriculum, and increased testing. Apparently.) We parents just need convincing, it would seem.\nPTE are also keen to promote ‘enrichment activities’. Absolutely nothing to disagree with there, enrichment is exactly what the word suggests (though it should happen within the curriculum, as well as outside it). I try not to be too cynical, but it’s hard to avoid wondering if they have added in the enrichment line to distract us from all the other market reform stuff. PTE has financial backers, so unlike other education campaign groups involving or aimed at parents, it’s got money. Quite whose, we have no idea – though the ‘donate’ button features prominently on their webpage and they are keen for people to contribute to their cause as they will, apparently, “never have the resources enjoyed by those opponents of change in the education system”. (Their words, not mine.) And quite a lot of people stand to benefit from those DfE reforms. Just not most pupils, teachers or parents.\nThose pupils, teachers and parents could all benefit from Justine Greening’s forthcoming consultation on primary assessment. Especially if it’s properly done, and independently led by experts. If Justine Greening wants to really engage with parents and make sure we are on side in her efforts to improve both our children’s education and their experience at school, there are other parent groups already out there – not be as well-connected to the Westminster elite, or with secret financial backers, but which don’t have an agenda apart from wanting their children’s schools to deliver a positive experience with good outcomes. Groups such as Let our Kids be Kids, or Rescue our Schools. Ms Greening, we’re waiting for your call.",
  "https_emmabishton_wordpress_com/https_emmabishton_wordpress_com_category_society/content_39.html": "Like several other local Labour Party members, I have spent a little time in the last couple of weeks putting leaflets through letter boxes in Hadleigh, as there is a County Council by-election on Thursday. Doesn’t sound all that exciting, I appreciate. But it matters. Not just because it matters anyway, but particularly because at the moment our county council (Suffolk) is one of those which is squirreling away reserves whilst cutting public services such as community transport, library funds and putting vulnerable elderly people into privatised but failing care homes. And there is always the possibility of a by-election getting the council to a tipping point where, with enough opposition, some of this damage can at least be paused, if not reversed.\nProtecting public services is the kind of result local people – of all political hues – generally want. Which is why many, more active, party members across the country get through a lot of shoe leather every week, pounding pavements and knocking on doors in attempts to persuade people of the case for voting Labour – or indeed for voting at all. (And despite the bad press given to most politicians, I think you’d be hard-pressed to find a committed member of any party who hasn’t done the same, in their attempt to persuade people that their answers to the big and little questions of public policy are the best solutions.)\nBut yesterday I hesitated before putting the leaflet through one of those letterboxes with a ‘No Junk Mail’ sticker. There are, sadly, many people who think that political communications are junk mail. Maybe they have bought into the discourse that all politically-active people are ‘in it for themselves’; maybe they just aren’t interested in much at all. Either way it’s a pretty sorry state of affairs. But if it is because they are disillusioned with the state of the debate at national level, I’m with them. I was actually rather relieved that no-one was about to talk to, as it’s rather embarrassing being in the Labour party at the moment.\nI’m a member of the party. That doesn’t make me a crazy Corbynista, a machiavellian plotter, an infiltrator or (what seems the worst insult of the moment) a ‘centrist’. It doesn’t make me a supporter of Momentum, nor does it make me proud of the MPs who decided that just when the country most needed strong opposition, they would create political havoc (all to no avail, it would appear) – even though, like them, I don’t think Jeremy Corbyn is the best person to lead the party. Like, I think, many thousands of party members, it makes me someone who wants Labour values to influence public and community life, and good left-wing policies in place at local and national level: things that make a positive difference to our lives and our children’ futures. But the present narrative in the mainstream media and the social media whirlwind is that Labour members are all new or old, democratic or anti-democratic, naive or selfish. There appears to be no middle ground. Well, I don’t want to be pigeon-holed, and nor do most of the people I know. Nor do I want to abandon the party just to get stuff done.\nA couple of weeks ago, I voted for Owen Smith. Not because he has all the answers, but because he at least represents an opportunity to start a new conversation. This time six years ago I was in the room at Labour party conference when Ed Miliband won his surprise victory. It’s no exaggeration to say the atmosphere was tense. I’d voted for him, for a number of reasons. And I know, it didn’t work out. Doesn’t look as if my candidate is likely to win this time round, but what is most frustrating is that whichever of them wins, neither of them is making things happen locally.\nThe everyday things that get discussed in councils – like whether 17-year-olds should have to pay to get to school, or which town can do without a fire engine – really do make a difference to people’s lives. The deeper that austerity bites, the harder it is for councillors (with the right values but the wrong budgets) to fight for the right answers. But the more we and the media focus only on the people at the top of the party, and on the splits in the party, the less room there is to actually discuss those issues and support the councillors and their supporters trying to stand up and make the right choices every day. Last week, the Labour opposition on the County Council proposed a motion aimed at improving the way elderly care home residents are treated in Suffolk – including the requirement that the county stop placing people in poorly-rated care homes. The Conservatives voted it down.\nThat by-election? It’s to replace a Conservative councillor who swanned off to live in the USA and refused, for eighteen months, to resign from his seat. The kind of self-serving caper that makes it into Private Eye, embarrasses even the Tories, and gives politicians of all hues a bad name. Whatever is going on in the national Labour Party on Thursday, and however it is played out through mainstream and social media, let’s hope the people of Hadleigh can see the wood for the trees and vote for the right candidate (which would be Sue Monks).",

  "https_emmabishton_wordpress_com/https_emmabishton_wordpress_com_2018_06_22_the-class-of-2006/content_42.html": "This morning, my eldest left school. The occasion was marked with a graduation ceremony in a marquee, complete with lovely performances from the school choir and soloists, a round of applause for every student, and a speech by our local MP. Graduation is a term I still can’t readily associate with being 16, but the sun shone, no-one (despite the array of heels on offer) fell over on stage, refreshments were tasty, and everyone seemed to enjoy themselves.\nAt the beginning of the event, the headteacher reminded us that this group of year 11 students started school in 2006, when amongst other things Tony Blair was prime minister, North Korea carried out its first nuclear test, and more locally, five women were murdered in Ipswich. He could have gone to say that in 2006, education spending totalled £87.8 billion (in real terms) – the seventh of twelve successive years of increased spending on education.\nFor the first four years of my son’s education, spending increased year on year. And things were looking good: education was moving up the policy agenda. Then, in 2010, Michael Gove got the job he’d been pitching for, and things took a turn for the worse. Funding has been decreasing every since, but that’s by no means the only change our schools have been battling with over the course of just one cohort’s progress through school. Here are just some of them:\n- Out of favour went Local Authorities, academics, parent governors and communities. In came business, Chief Executives, and branding.\n- Up went testing, the priority given to core subjects, and the link between test results and school accountability. Down went teacher morale and staff retention.\n- Up went “rigour”. Down went freedom in the classroom and creativity.\n- Down went specialist support for those with additional needs; Up went exclusions.\n- Down went access to the arts and counselling; Soaring went the numbers of young people needing support for mental health problems.\n- Up went school leaving age. Down went the number of schools able to afford to offer ‘less common’ subjects (like languages and music).\n- Here in Suffolk, Up went the number of secondary schools (but, crucially, not the numbers of people needing school places). With the paradoxical consequence, just this week, that Down goes the school bus service. The only silver lining here is that we stopped another one opening up the road and distorting what our catchment school could offer.\n- Out of fashion went education as the means by which children gain the motivation to learn for life, and the skills to do so. In came schooling as a transactional and time-limited process.\nTo cap it all, the 2006 cohort have just endured what are commonly being referred to as “the toughest ever GCSEs”. Not only are they tough, but what they test seems increasingly irrelevant. Acquisition and recall of facts are prized above critical and interpretative skills, and above the interpersonal skills of the workplace. Inevitably, to prepare them for this, primary school tests have got harder too. And – just to prove the point – so have A’levels. (All despite the very obvious statistical truth that making exams harder doesn’t in itself raise exam results, no matter how many times schools ministers might say so on Women’s Hour.)\nWhilst much of this chaos has been released since 2010, some of it was set in train before that, as a consequence of the rise of neo-liberalism generally, and because of our consistent failure as a society to debate what education is actually for. In his mercifully short speech, our MP spoke this morning about changes to the world of work – the advent of automation, and the implications of this for the jobs the young people sat in front of him might be doing in a few years time. Which does rather raise the question: if we don’t know at this point what jobs people will be doing, why are they being educated now for the jobs of the last century? In a world where we may not even need to learn how to drive a car, wouldn’t an education that prioritised the understanding, appraisal and application of knowledge be rather more useful than one that is more obsessed with testing acquisition and recall of facts? And if young people are to be deprived of work in the sense that we now know it, wouldn’t it be useful to help them develop their passions, promote their wellbeing, and nurture their capacity to share in and sustain their communities?\nSpeaking personally, we’ve had a good ride so far. But that’s because the schools my children have attended have bucked the trend, and kept smiling against the odds. They have valued – and promoted – music, the arts, personal wellbeing, sport, access to the out-of-doors, creativity in the classroom, and sought to build rapport with the communities in which they are based. They talk of resilience, of respect, of happiness. Their primary school, in particular, has never lost sight of the value of joy.\nSo what beckons, for the ‘cohort of 2018’ starting school this September? Schools are facing a crisis in funding, in morale, in staff recruitment and retention, in freedom to act in the interests of the pupils that teachers go into teaching for. All things considered, my eldest has been lucky.",
  "https_emmabishton_wordpress_com/https_emmabishton_wordpress_com_2013_01_13_what-makes-a-good-school-and-how-would-we-know/content_98.html": "Ofsted tells us which schools are outstanding, good, satisfactory or less than satisfactory. But it measures only certain things, albeit crucial ones about teaching, learning and leadership. League tables rank schools, based on exam or SAT results, which doesn’t tell the reader much apart from what the school’s test results are (though the reader informed about the local area or demographics generally may draw out a bit more). Neither an Ofsted report nor a league table reveal what a child’s experience is at any given school, nor how likely they might be to emerge at 16 or 18 as a well-rounded individual prepared for citizenship and work, and able to make the most of adult life.\nSo what makes a good school? I was fortunate in that I got to ask this question last Thursday, in a room at the Royal Society of Arts (RSA) as part of the RSA & Suffolk County Council review ‘Raising the Bar’ (see elsewhere in this blog), which was full of experts from across education. In a small group discussion we agreed that good schools share a number of attributes: they are ‘outward-looking’, engaged in their community, can apply creative solutions to problems and offer pupils a range of curricular and extra-curricular activities. These attributes are of course additional to certain central factors: good schools have teachers in them who wish to teach and are enabled to develop as teachers, leaders who can lead, and effective personal and social education provision. Results are a part, but by definition they are the consequence, not the driver of quality in schools.\nBeing ‘outward-looking’ was considered to be key in our discussion. What does it mean? A school which is outward-looking welcomes and makes links with the world outside the school gate, and seeks opportunities for collaboration. These opportunities might be with other schools, with local employers, or with schools across the globe. In each case, the school actively seeks them, and is open to people engaging with the school.\n(Above and beyond this, many parents have views about the relative importance of aspects such as performing arts provision (important to me), competitive sports opportunities, and specific subject specialisms. But this is where parental choice can come in, for those able to exercise it.)\nI believe that our current obsession with league tables and exam data crowds out other, more subtle and difficult-to-measure data. This monochromatic view of existing schools is at least partly responsible for leading many parents to a wholesale dissatisfaction with the schools on offer. It is also part of the drive for new Free Schools. But I don’t think that it is because the existing schools are bad, but because we don’t have a mechanism, when judging schools, to take account of those attributes such as being outward-looking, or offering enriching activities, which I believe make the difference.\nThis of course leads to my next question: How would we know a good school? Personally, having been able to visit a number of schools, I think there is no substitute for visiting a school, and this point was reinforced on Thursday by the headteachers and others in the small group discussion. All schools have readily-discernable differences in character and atmosphere as well as general pupil behaviour; a school ranked ‘good’ in league tables will not necessarily have that buzz which to me is readily experienced when walking through the corridors of a school I would wish to send my children to.\nHowever, many parents don’t visit prospective schools. I believe we should encourage all parents to visit schools – even if they are not choosing between schools but simply finding out about their ‘catchment’ school. This way lies greater potential for engagement between school and parents and between school and community. And there will be ways of encouraging this – perhaps starting with the pupils themselves.\nBut meanwhile, I can’t help wondering what other ways there might be to answer this second question. Simply agreeing on those aspects which define a good school and creating a means of quantifying them, clearly runs the risk of establishing another set of league tables, as well as potentially devaluing those qualitative aspects deemed key to the experience of a school by reducing them to tick-boxes.\nI’m curious about all this, and keen to explore it some more. Doubtless my ramblings on the subject will appear above this post in due course!\nPosted by Fiona (@nlpmum) on 14 January 2013 at 1:12 pm\nHi Emma, I think our current measurement of schools is leading us to demean the importance of the extracurricular elements of education. My kids attend a primary school run by a “tick box” headmistress who does all in her power to insure that the Ofstead is great. They run occasional 4 week after school clubs (cooking and football)…. there have been about 4 of these in the 4 years I’ve had kids at the school! Personally I think a few measures of these things would be a good idea since the tick box headmistress would then be forced to consider them. Currently the PTA is struggling to get any extra curricular activity in the school at all.\nRegarding parents looking at schools…… I think it’s very difficult for parents to know what to look for until they’ve had kids in school for a while. For example, bullying policy isn’t an issue until your child is bullied and extra curricular activity isn’t important when you have a 4 yr old and you’re just wanting them to be happy with a good reception level teacher. I feel we were totally taken in by a fantastic reception level teach but didn’t do the rest of the school justice at all when we looked round the school…… though I did have reservations about the head and she does seem to be the main stumbling block. Given that many parents do look at the Ofstead, it might help if there was a quantitative measure included of extra curricular activity and school trips (or some such)…. at least this would act as a trigger for parents looking at schools to ask about these things and may well motivate the results oriented heads to improve on these measures. I now believe they are fundamental to our kids learning and we are having to do a lot of out of school activity to make up for the lack in school.\nPosted by Emma Bishton on 23 January 2013 at 10:39 pm\nHello Fiona thanks for your comment. I think you make a number of good points – particularly about the usefulness of a tick box exercise if it is the only thing that might lead to the inclusion of extra-curricular activities, and also about not knowing what we want from schools (or a specific policies) until we are already ‘consumers’. All the more reason to have some broader means of evaluating and assessing our schools. Good luck with your PTA work I hope you succeed – but a fantastic reception teacher is a good start!",
  "https_emmabishton_wordpress_com/https_emmabishton_wordpress_com_2017_07_21_dear-education-secretary-did-your-school-offer-arts-subjects/content_43.html": "Dear Ms Greening\nI am writing in response to the government’s consultation response on implementing the EBacc, which was finally published on Wednesday, 18 months (nearly five school terms!) after the consultation closed. As a supporter of the BACC for the Future campaign, I was one of those parents who had filed a response to the consultation arguing that there is no evidence to support the use of EBacc as a measure, that it is undermining a broad-based education across the curriculum, limiting access to creative GCSEs, reducing pupil choice and opportunity, and risking our creative industries.\nAs the government has been forced to acknowledge in this week’s publication, there is a great deal of unease amongst school leaders, teachers, parents, and creative industries, about the impact of continuing to use the EBacc as a performance measure for schools. As your document makes clear, there’s also a huge difficulty in actually implementing the EBacc at required scale because of the shortage of language and other teachers (a fact which is unlikely to be reversed by the government’s ongoing refusal to end the pay cap on public sector workers). This is presumably why you have pushed back the targets on the proportion of pupils entering the EBacc by a few years, a welcome step. But that doesn’t alter the fact that requiring 75%, 90% or any other % of pupils to take the EBacc limits their school experience and their career choices. Nor does it add anything meaningful to our understanding of how well schools are meeting pupils’ educational needs.\nAs you point out, 71% of respondents were concerned about the EBacc reducing curriculum choice. There are clear statistics from organisations – including Ofqual – about the steady decline (8% last year) in students taking arts and technical subjects at GCSE. Limiting GCSE choices makes creative subjects less visible (as is also happening at primary schools as the curriculum narrows to focus excessively on SATs). Less visible subjects quickly become less viable, across the whole curriculum. Looking locally, there are apparently three secondary schools in Suffolk alone who will not be offering music on the curriculum next year. And yet you continue to assert that the arts are important.\nThere is no shortage of evidence about why access to the arts and creative subjects matters, both for themselves and because of the impact access to the arts has on wellbeing and other areas of study. But there is a distinct shortage of parents with the resources (whether these be funds, time or prior knowledge) to enable their children to access the arts and other creative subjects outside school, in ways which can help them fulfil their needs and desires. And they shouldn’t be asked to, as that is what school is for. Government is full of people who will have benefited from a broad based education delivered by schools whose curriculum was unimpeded by the EBacc – a performance measure so meaningless it is not valued by Russell Group universities. So please, let the next generation of children have the same experience. “One system for me, another one for you” is not a good message for our children.\nGiven that you are faced with growing pressures on our schools and an overwhelming body of responses to the EBacc consultation which clearly opposed its ongoing and increased use, it seems extraordinary that the government didn’t use the last 18 months to quietly abandon the EBacc altogether. For our children’s futures and the future health of our creative industries, please review the decision to continue with the EBacc.\nI look forward to your reply.",

He’ll be singing again tonight, in the new school hall at the centre of an impressive, light, well-organised school building that has replaced not just the crumbling theatre but a series of buildings that were both too small and too old to service the school (whose numbers increased by half due to a local schools reorganisation). In an ideal world, they’d have had a new theatre in the new building, but we don’t live in an ideal world, and no school can provide everything everyone wants. In fact many schools now live in a world which is so far from ideal that replacing old buildings, or putting on big school shows, are just pipe dreams. My children have been lucky. But this is a state education system educating the vast majority of children in the country. Paid for by taxpayers. In the 21st century why on earth should UK children have to be lucky to get schooled in a building which is actually fit for purpose?\nLooking at the educational news stories around today, “Welcome to the world of spin” might be more apposite description of where we find ourselves. (And yes, I do know that spin is officially out of fashion. Doesn’t make it out of use though.) This morning the National Audit Office published a report revealing that £6.7 million is needed to bring old school buildings up to standard. This follows hot on the heels of another of their reports, from last December, which revealed that schools need to make cuts of about 8% by 2020 because of rising costs and increased numbers of pupils. Meanwhile the Education Select Committee, which notices rather more about what’s going on that the government might like, reported yesterday that teacher shortages are now at crisis point. Call me a cynic, but I can’t help wondering if the government is hoping the teacher shortage will solve the budget deficit (without anyone noticing, of course).\nI’m sure it’s no coincidence that on the same day the latest NAO report was published, the New Schools Network (which sorts out new free schools for the government) released an advertising jingle for Michaela Free School. (It’s worth a watch, if only to wonder why it’s so necessary for the school’s head and founder to be so passive-aggressive towards all other schools and why she’s the only person who gets to speak about how happy the children are.) So the children are happy at school, and learning. Well yes, I would hope they would be, whether it’s a free school or not.\nWhilst they outsource yarn-spinning to the New Schools Network, what else is the government doing to resolve the multiple crises facing our schools? Why, proposing to build 500 additional free schools by 2020, of course, spending £240 million on new grammar schools, blathering on about a new funding formula that – whilst needed – is not actually addressing the budget problem, and giving back £368million to the Treasury that it was going to spend on forcing schools to be academies. (It’s still planning to make them all academies, just without making such a fuss about it). Oh and surveying teachers who have left the profession rather than finding out what would encourage teachers still in the profession to stay there. All in all, a position otherwise known as sticking its head in the sand. Which, if it isn’t already, they should really add to the PE curriculum. That’s the kind of detail they like talking about. Big things, like making sure the schools are actually still standing, is clearly a bit beyond them.",
  "https_emmabishton_wordpress_com/https_emmabishton_wordpress_com_tag_schools/content_65.html": "Last night (before my MP was in the news for other reasons entirely) I joined many others across the country in emailing my MP to urge him to vote for the amendment to the Children & Families Bill being debated on Tuesday. This amendment would make PSHE and SRE education part of the statutory curriculum – much overdue, and very much needed. More information on the Consent to Consent campaign which led to this amendment being tabled is available here. Here’s what I wrote:\n8th June 2013\nDear Tim\nI am writing to ask your voting intention in regard to the amendment to the Children and Families Bill due to be debated this Tuesday, 11th June, and to urge you to vote in favour of the proposed amendment. As you are aware, the amendment proposes changes to the curriculum that would see the addition of PSHE to the National Curriculum, make age-appropriate Sex & Relationships education a statutory component of the curriculum at all four educational key stages, and specify that same-sex relationships, sexual violence, domestic violence and sexual consent be covered in the PSHE curriculum. Building on the reasons already articulated by the Coalition of Consent Campaign, there are four reasons why I believe this amendment is not only timely, but necessary:\nCurrently schools are only required to ensure that pupils understand how to use contraception and why it is important. They are not required to ensure that pupils understand the context in which contraception is used – i.e to help develop their understanding of healthy, appropriate and loving relationships. Nor are they required to ensure that children leave school understanding what constitutes a healthy diet, or able to address poor self-esteem and low confidence.\nAs a parent in your constituency, I am confident that the schools my children attend understand the importance of PSHE and SRE and also that they comprehend the necessary breadth of these subjects. But I am also very concerned about the context and culture within which these schools now operate; one where increasing test scores in core skills – important though this is – takes precedence over ensuring that children leave school as mature, confident citizens who can display both a love of learning and a readiness to take on the challenges of adult life. Anxiety about budgets and timetable capacity for key skills has, I understand, already led to schools in this region reducing pastoral support and PSHE provision. The proposed amendment would put PSHE and SRE back firmly within the school curriculum.\nThe UK Youth Parliament have made A Curriculum for Life (which includes compulsory PSHE, with a mandatory training programme for teachers), their priority campaign for 2013. They did this because they understand why pupils need to be taught vital life skills at school, and because they have first-hand experience of the wide variation between schools currently in terms of both the position of PSHE on the curriculum and the consequent quality of teaching provided. Responding to the UKYP by supporting this amendment would demonstrate that the government really is prepared to put service-users at the heart of policy-making.\nFinally, the educational case for including PSHE and SRE is clear. Pupils who demonstrate ‘risk behaviours’ (e.g. alcohol-misuse, unsafe sex, anti-social behaviours) are more at risk of school exclusion or truancy and less likely to achieve their potential. But pupils who are supported to achieve positive wellbeing (in relation to healthy lifestyles, emotional & mental wellbeing and relationships) demonstrate higher attainment. Evidence for this is provided by – amongst others – The Young Foundation in their report “Noticing the Change – a Framework of Outcomes for Young People in Practice” published in March this year.\nI look forward to the debate on Tuesday which is not only overdue but very much needed, and hope to hear that you have voted in favour of the amendment.\nyours sincerely",

This is a new network for women in Suffolk who care about what’s happening in the world and the impact the current ‘austerity drive’ is having on our lives – in particular on our children and families.\nThe tougher things get, the harder it can be to think that our actions can make a difference, and to wonder if there is any point. And the harder it can be to find the time. But action does make a difference – there are plenty of examples of successful community campaigns or political campaigns which show us that: as I turned on my car radio one day recently, BBC Radio 4’s Women’s Hour was interviewing women who have got out there and campaigned – for varying reasons and in a range of circumstances – from seeking justice for the victims of Hillsborough to raising awareness of everyday sexism.\nAnyone who is politically active – to a greater or lesser extent – may have experienced the current sense of ennui and mistrust with ‘things political’ when out in the market square, on the doorstep, or even whilst watching the news. But we need that to change – the current government appears to be doing all it can to change family life, and the social landscape, for the worse. Our services and the people who need them are suffering, and we can’t afford to let the government get away with it. I believe that if we get out there with whatever time we have to offer and get active we can make a difference – whether that’s in obvious political formulations (and we do have a political system, so we do need to regain trust in it, but that’s for another blog post), via politically unaffiliated groups like 38Degrees, or by getting out there in our communities doing something which may seem very small but could make a big difference. Every little does indeed help. One of the people on that Women’s Hour episode – Rachel Owen – had started her campaign by walking into a newsagents and asking him not to display provocative tabloid images outside the shop at eye-level for young children.\nSuffolk Voices is an attempt to make sure women’s voices are heard in Suffolk, and to provide a forum for women to find the solidarity and support to become more active. I’m not a radical feminist, but I do think that sometimes we have a different take on things than men, and also that existing forums aren’t always as ‘female-friendly’ as we (or indeed they) would like. I really hope the network is a success. To get things going, there are three speakers at this event who have a wealth of experience not just of campaigning but of the effects of ‘Austerity Britain’ on women and families here and now. The idea is to hear the speakers, have some time for discussion and meet other like-minded people over a ‘bring and share’ lunch. The network is being launched by Jane Basham, the Suffolk Labour PCC candidate who was very nearly elected to the post in October, and Sandra Gage, community and Labour activist from Ipswich. The launch of the network follows Jane’s tireless PCC campaign which got women talking across Suffolk about things that matter.\nHow will we know if the network is a success? I’m sure that will come up in discussion next week, but meanwhile my first thoughts are that it is successful if it results in more people talking at the school gate about ‘austerity Britain’ and its effects on family life, a few women volunteering to do door-to-door deliveries of election handouts in their street, or even someone walking in to their local newsagent asking for provocative images of women to be displayed inside, not outside the shop.",
  "https_emmabishton_wordpress_com/https_emmabishton_wordpress_com_2016_10_28_call-waiting/content_22.html": "Having had her thunder – and her policy agenda – neatly stolen by Teresa May’s pronouncements on extending grammar schools before she had even time to get her feet under her new desk, Justine Greening has finally produced some policy of her own. On Tuesday she announced some changes to primary school assessment tests (the dreaded SATs). My daughter did SATs earlier this year, and I was one of many who were unhappy enough with SATs and their impact on children and schools that I considered withdrawing her from school during SATS week, so I was interested to hear what she had to say.\nJustine Greening’s announcement included the welcome withdrawal of the threat that children who had been deemed to ‘fail’ their SATs would have to resit them in year 7, and the equally welcome statement that the KS1 spelling and grammar test remains voluntary (though quite who would volunteer to do such a test is beyond me!). She announced that a review of primary assessment is needed and forward-promoted a consultation into primary school assessment which will start in the spring, and that meanwhile there will be no new tests introduced before the 2018-19 academic year.\nSuch stability might sound like a good thing, but that still leaves thousands of pupils and primary schools facing an every-narrowing curriculum and unnecessary, stressful tests for the next two years at least, in order to carry on jumping through a series of hoops of the DfE’s choosing. (After all, if a week is a long time in politics, a year is an eternity for a 10 year old.) That is more than a shame, when she could have taken the opportunity to suspend SATS altogether given that they are not actually about pupils at all, they’re a means of manufacturing school league tables.\nUnlike her predecessors, Michael Gove and Nicky Morgan, who given to zealously issuing edicts, Justine Greening clearly has a more conciliatory, listening tone. And in acknowledging that a review of primary school assessment is needed, she appears to question, at the very least, the merit of some of the policy that she has inherited. But in announcing that the DfE will launch a consultation, she’s missed a opportunity. That the DfE will be involved in such a consultation suggests that she shares her predecessors’ enthusiasm for micro-management and policy leadership in an area where there is no shortage of actual independent experts who are willing and able to provide appropriate guidance for politicians to act on. The Headteachers Roundtable, for instance, have already gone to the bother of producing an alternative education Green Paper which neatly explains why using pupil assessment to measure school performance is a bad idea, and proposes alternative solutions for both pupil assessment and school accountability, I hope she already has a well-worn copy of that on her desk. (As yet the Green Paper doesn’t come with a summary, let alone one aimed at parents rather than headteachers, so I recommend a large coffee before starting to read it!)\nI don’t know whether Justine Greening is already talking to the Headteachers Roundtable. But she does say that she is interested in talking to parents, as well as teachers and unions (though no mention of experts, interestingly). I just hope she doesn’t cherry-pick her parents.\nLast month saw the launch of a new educational ‘campaign’ called Parents and Teachers for Excellence. Now I think you’d struggle to find parents or teachers who were against excellence, so even to the vaguely cynical the group already sounds like an exercise in spin. But if you take a closer look, you’ll find that this apparently ‘non-partisan’ group which claims to be separate to the Westminster elite appears to be nothing but a soft mouthpiece for Conservative education ‘reformers’. (Of the 29 people on its advisory group, only 4 are listed as parents, CEOs or other leaders in Academy chains figure prominently, and the group includes the governments’ ‘Behaviour Tsar’ as well as a former education advisor to the prime minister). It doesn’t look very independent to me.\nThe group describes itself as a campaign seeking an evidence-based approach to education. I’m with them on that, but only if they start off from a neutral position, not from a perspective that uses ideological assumptions as if they were some kind of truth. In my dictionary, non-partisan means not taking sides. Yet the stated starting position for this group is that they already know free schools and academies “work”. (Oh and behaviour policies, knowledge-based curriculum, and increased testing. Apparently.) We parents just need convincing, it would seem.\nPTE are also keen to promote ‘enrichment activities’. Absolutely nothing to disagree with there, enrichment is exactly what the word suggests (though it should happen within the curriculum, as well as outside it). I try not to be too cynical, but it’s hard to avoid wondering if they have added in the enrichment line to distract us from all the other market reform stuff. PTE has financial backers, so unlike other education campaign groups involving or aimed at parents, it’s got money. Quite whose, we have no idea – though the ‘donate’ button features prominently on their webpage and they are keen for people to contribute to their cause as they will, apparently, “never have the resources enjoyed by those opponents of change in the education system”. (Their words, not mine.) And quite a lot of people stand to benefit from those DfE reforms. Just not most pupils, teachers or parents.\nThose pupils, teachers and parents could all benefit from Justine Greening’s forthcoming consultation on primary assessment. Especially if it’s properly done, and independently led by experts. If Justine Greening wants to really engage with parents and make sure we are on side in her efforts to improve both our children’s education and their experience at school, there are other parent groups already out there – not be as well-connected to the Westminster elite, or with secret financial backers, but which don’t have an agenda apart from wanting their children’s schools to deliver a positive experience with good outcomes. Groups such as Let our Kids be Kids, or Rescue our Schools. Ms Greening, we’re waiting for your call.",

  "https_emmabishton_wordpress_com/https_emmabishton_wordpress_com_2014_02_27_time-to-change-the-record/content_68.html": "The retiring chief executive of the NHS, David Nicholson, stated on Newsnight on Monday night that a health service that shares risk across the population is much more likely to be successful at delivering healthcare than one based on private insurance. In other words, a National Health Service (or a system very much like it) is not only the fairest way of providing healthcare, it’s also the best way to do it.\nYet an insurance-based system is exactly what the system is being stealthily morphed into. When we see companies like Serco Group profiting from delivering community nursing, NHS hospitals going into debt, damaging cuts to health services, and private healthcare companies keen to be commissioning services as well as delivering them, it’s hard not to see the insurance companies circling overhead. So instead of being “by the people, for the people” (to borrow a phrase – but not a system – from over the pond) it’s looking rather as if our NHS is “by the people, for some of the people, for very few of the people’s bank balances”. Not a very good message for a system built on the right to equity of access.\nJeremy Hunt et al would probably be delighted if we all responded to this assault on our NHS by taking out health insurance premiums, but he’s not asked us to do that. (Not yet, anyway.) What he has done is proposed a new medical records database, Care.data, to bring together all our medical records (hospital and GP) in one place. This is actually a good idea, but he’s bungled it, with the result that many people fear private healthcare organisations and insurance companies will not only be running the show, but profiting from the use of our personal health data too.\nHunt appears to have been assisted in bungling the establishment of Care.data by NHS England, which is something of a pity. (Failing to send out information, or having it arrive with the junk mail isn’t a convincing message when you want people to trust what you are doing.) Luckily Ben Goldacre, writing in the Guardian, has set out very clearly why Care.data is a good thing, what the problems are that need resolving, and how some of these should be dealt with over the next couple of months. Sadly, as Goldacre also noted, these problems appeared to get worse not better yesterday, when the body in charge (Health and Social Care Information Centre) appeared before the Health Select Committee and the full extent of the chaos was revealed.\nHowever, even supposing all these problems are satisfactorily addressed, there remains a fairly fundamental lack of trust in Care.data which threatens to jeopardise the whole project. The success of Care.data depends upon us, as citizens, supporting it; failing to address the lack of trust makes it more likely that more people will choose to opt out and exclude their personal records from the database. We are, rightly, cautious about safeguarding our personal data. And here the data in question isn’t just our bank account details, or where we live – it’s highly sensitive information often arising from situations in which we are at our most vulnerable. So the concerns are not just about trespass, theft and profit (valid though these are), they are also about protecting our emotional selves.\nThere’s a role for Hunt here, surely? It shouldn’t be left to commentators like Goldacre to reassure the public; isn’t that one of the functions of a Secretary of State? He doesn’t do the ‘doing’, but he is responsible for the message. He should be not only issuing supportive words, but also being seen to support the principles and delivery of the service. This doesn’t just mean continuing to say that healthcare will be “free at the point of use” when an opportunity arises, it also means recognising that all the bad press and all the cuts and reorganisation are leading to a fundamental mistrust of the system which needs to be addressed. (Stepping in to stop extreme and damaging cuts in local mental health services would be a good start, for example.) Despite Stafford, despite the deficit, despite the pressures of a growing and ageing population, we still have one of the finest healthcare services in the world. It’s about time he said so and didn’t rely on civil servants like David Nicholson to do that for him. Perhaps he’s absented himself from the debate because it is so very clear that the public don’t trust him? If that’s the case, it’s time for him to put the interests of our health service first and resign.\nAs things stand at the moment, I’m undecided about whether to stay in or opt out of Care.data. I was all for staying in – staying in should be a no-brainer, as it’s in all our interests to have effective research and commissioning, and a national database will assist enormously with these. But there are a lot of concerns – both practical and fundamental – which need answering. Andy Burnham made it clear yesterday that Labour could assist with sorting out the mess, as the prize is too important to play politics with. Over to you, Mr Hunt?",

But this one, and this campaign, is so exactly in tune with my thoughts about what is happening to our primary school pupils and schools, that I thought it time to start.

More than a Score aims to change that. I’m actively involved in Rescue our Schools, one of the partners in the #morethanascoreUK campaign. Please go to morethanascore.co.uk to find out more, and sign the campaign pledge.\nI should start by saying that I love teaching and I love my school.

I am, of course, hoping for a response! But I’m also interested to hear other people’s thoughts on the subject.\nI am writing in response to BBC News coverage of the Act of Remembrance from the Tower of London yesterday. In this report the poppies at the Tower were shown to full effect, producing a profoundly moving representation of the extent and nature of the losses incurred in the first world war. However I found the coverage of the actual two minute silence discomfiting.\nThe two-minute silence was well observed, as usual. But I was struck that during the silence, we were shown pictures of the silence being observed across the country. So whilst there was auditory silence, there was no ‘visual silence’ for television news viewers.\nSilence is very unfamiliar in public life. It is also often uncomfortable. Which is why it is there – giving an opportunity to reflect on a personal level about the nature and implications of conflict, and the human losses incurred. Showing camera shots panning across the country offers a way out of that discomfort, and in my view fails to honour the intention of the silence. (It is perhaps also worth noting that such camera work is redolent of more celebratory events (Last Night of the Proms, for example) which are indeed opportunities for celebration.)\nI understand the importance of showing remembrance events from across the four UK nations, and the desire to depict a range of institutions and communities. However, in my view these images belong elsewhere in the news coverage. The silence should be just that – silence.\nYours sincerely\nEmma Bishton",

In essence, they’ve abandoned traditional school catchments in favour of transport zones around schools, in the hope of cutting costs (or at least, making someone else pay). The result doesn’t look very likely to save them much money. Instead, it’s created chaos, stress and confusion for parents, children and schools. Plus no doubt a lot of extra work for the already-beleaguered council officials trying to administer the new policy.\nWhy school transport was a problem (even before the Council meddled with it)\nIn fairness to the council, some of the problems with school transport weren’t of their making. Education policy is developed in an urban environment, so how children actually get to school in more rural areas is an afterthought for the DfE. Which means 1) it’s not adequately funded and 2) it’s dealt with separately from other education services provided by councils (school admissions and school improvement). Plus there are two national policies creating problems locally: the government obsession with pushing schools to be academies (which can control their own admissions) and the development of Free Schools. These policies have left Suffolk with a big surplus of school places in some areas, and schools competing for enough pupils to make budgets add up.\nNot a good starting point. Then there’s the problem that most of the (Conservative) councillors in Suffolk, like in so many of the county shires, are not representative of the majority of parents with children in the school system. (Here’s an example: according to their Registers of Interest, more than half of the council’s cabinet are members of the National Trust.) So 1) they don’t appear to appreciate the financial impact on young families of paying for travel to school and 2) they promote the dogma of School Choice over the practicalities of family life.\nWhat the council decided\nSome things are obvious to anyone who thinks about them. For instance:\n1) Promoting links between primary and secondary schools creates smoother transitions for pupils. Pupils who feel safe and supported are better able to learn. Children, and their parents, typically want to move to secondary school with their current friends (even if they then go on to form new friendships). So for decades, secondary schools have had catchment areas and designated ‘feeder primary schools’. Communities are sustained and develop around these arrangements (which is why, for example, people from my village go to the Park Run based at our local secondary school).\n2) School buses are a cost-effective way of ensuring pupils get to school. Without a bus, parents would have to drive their child to school – putting more cars on the road, costing parents time they could spend at work (there’s a Conservative policy irony). Despite the best efforts of the Council to promote parents buying wellies and torches, the likelihood of children walking to school, in all weathers, is pretty minimal. How many parents would be happy for their 8 year old to walk two miles or more twice a day, crossing A roads and trudging along muddy (unlit) public footpaths through fields? (And yes this is the countryside, so some of those fields will have cows in.) We no longer live in the nineteenth century. Yes kids need to exercise, but this isn’t the way to make that happen.\nSo the council prioritised short-term budget savings (and, presumably, a desire to be seen to be able to enforce their own policies, however naively developed) over the basic responsibility of getting children to school in the safest and most efficient way possible. They decided that from this September, children will now only be offered free travel to school if it is to their ‘transport priority school’ (in other words the nearest school, calculated by the metre on what they call the “shortest available route along which a child, accompanied as necessary, may walk with reasonable safety”. Out go school catchments, in come footpath maps (a peculiar way to go about improving pupil attainment, never mind anything else). The result of this is that children in neighbouring streets, in the same village (Nayland being an example), can be allocated transport to different schools. Anything else has to be paid for.\nThe Outcome\nWill this new policy save them any money? I doubt it. The solutions in my village, for instance, rather than using the bus which is already available (and subsidised by the Council), will quite possibly see children put in taxis to get to school, or the council paying for two buses instead of one. Alternatively, parents will be forced to pay for what the council calls a ‘spare seat’ – a seat on the bus that is going to their preferred school already. This year that pass will cost them £750. In two years time it will cost £930 – per child! (And bear in mind parents with a child at sixth form are already paying the £750 because free travel for over 16s was taken away years ago – at about the point when children were required to stay in education until the age of 18). Or parents will be forced into cars – an arrangement the council euphemistically refers to as “parents arranging informal solutions themselves”. (As residents in villages like Boxford and Nayland know, traffic problems for some of village primary schools are bad enough already.) Or schools resorting to deciding between funding a bus to get their pupils to school or a teaching assistant for them once they get there. The Council clearly don’t mind which of these so-called ‘solutions’ parents or schools opt for, as long as it’s no longer their problem.\nA pretty sorry failure whichever way you look at it.",
  "https_emmabishton_wordpress_com/https_emmabishton_wordpress_com_2013_05_29_whose-nhs-is-it/content_27.html": "Yesterday I signed the most recent NHS petition by the highly-organised campaign group 38Degrees against limiting access to GP appointments, joining 189,206 others (at the time of writing). The proposal in question is one which (as reported in The Independent) was circulating last week in the TorySphere as part of a ‘discussion brief’ on healthcare for Conservative activists. Today, Jeremy Hunt, the Secretary of State for Health, has been forced to state that limiting appointments will never become Conservative policy.\nI can’t help wondering whether it was proposed to deflect attention from other more complex proposals, or to make people feel relieved when proposals that would otherwise have been unconscionable are put forward. But supposing it was a serious proposal, it shows little understanding of how or why people use the NHS. Whilst it’s certainly true that the sharp-elbowed are more likely to ‘get their taxes’ worth’ out of their GP than those who are vulnerable, it’s also true that people who are ill visit their GP. Some people are isolated, anxious and depressed, and the GP may not be able to address all of their concerns. But people don’t visit their GP for pleasure: reducing access to GPs could only result in more people turning up at A&E, which would surely be a political own-goal for Mr Hunt!\nWhatever else Mr Hunt proposes for the NHS, he’s got the service at a bit of a crossroads at the moment. During May, as reported in The Guardian, BUPA and other private health firms were granted access to patient-identifiable information for a (relatively small) fee. Yet since the Health and Social Care Act came into effect in April this year, commissioning groups – public sector organisations whose job is to ensure that the public has access to effective and efficient healthcare – have not had access to patient-identifiable data on hospital admissions which would help them monitor and commission care properly.\nThe Primary Care Trusts, which used to commission healthcare, used to have access to this information, but access now depends on information governance arrangements which have yet to be put in place. BUPA might want this information to ‘support the NHS with services like population health management’, but they will be at an unfair advantage if NHS commissioners can’t access the same information.\nWhat does this mean? Does it matter if private companies deliver more of our healthcare providing it’s still free at the point of delivery? I’d say yes. Not just because I don’t see private healthcare companies queuing up to take on the difficult, expensive, and time-consuming cases; not just because it’s hard not to see private healthcare companies adding in charges and forcing a differentiation between those who can afford to pay that little bit more for a decent meal, and those who can’t. But also because it goes against what we as a nation want from our NHS.\nThere has been no better advert for the NHS of late than the BBC series ‘Keeping Britain Alive’. If you haven’t watched it, please try and catch an episode on iPlayer. Despite having worked in the NHS for 20 years, I watched the episodes avidly, and I’m missing my regular appointment with BBC2 on Tuesday evenings. The BBC brought us documentaries which clearly highlighted the way in which the NHS responds to real people, all the time, regardless of circumstance, and often regardless of whether our own lifestyles have contributed to ill-health. They showed the breadth of the service, from neuro-surgery to community care for people with learning disabilities. They also showed its expertise, experience, and humanity.\nI just hope Mr Hunt – and anyone who might consider voting for him in 2015 – was watching.\nPosted by Ramping up the Health Bill | The Way we Live Now on 25 July 2013 at 5:26 pm\n[…] Not just because of the continued sale of the nation’s silver – from Blood Plasma UK to healthcare data to community care services, with much more set to follow as a consequence of the so-called […]",
  "https_emmabishton_wordpress_com/https_emmabishton_wordpress_com_tag_singing/content_85.html": "Last week I had the pleasure of accompanying Nayland primary school ukelele group to perform in Snape Maltings as part of the Suffolk Schools Celebration of Music. That event – which I’ve referred to previously in this blog – is a fantastic opportunity for children from schools across Suffolk, regardless of their experience or level of musical knowledge, to come together and perform in the wonderful acoustic of one of the UK’s top professional concert halls. I have now been three times to this Celebration; each time it has succeeded in being inclusive yet professional, and each time the children have gained enormously from the experience.\nThe benefits of opportunities like this go far beyond the performance on the night – enjoyable and thrilling as that is. So events like this must be protected, in demand, and supported. But the rhetoric from the DfE – whilst on the one hand supporting the inclusion of music in the primary curriculum – suggests that creative endeavour is of little value. Creative arts subjects remain excluded from the EBacc and the A’level equivalent as schools are encouraged down ever-narrowing lines of academic enquiry. That’s why I followed the lead set by the Bacc to the Future campaign and wrote today to my MP – Tim Yeo – asking him to include the creative arts subjects in these school league tables. The text of that letter is below. I’ll add the reply when I receive it.\n“Dear Tim\nI am writing to ask your views and intended actions in relation to the omission of creative subjects from the Government’s English Baccalaureate (EBacc) and the equivalent A-level league table measures.\nCurrently EBacc and A-level equivalent league tables place significant pressure on schools to focus on just five ‘pillars’ of study: maths, English, sciences, languages (including Ancient Greek and Latin) and humanities (defined as just history and geography).\nI appreciate the importance of English, maths and science as core ‘enabling’ subjects. But the exclusion of creative subjects from the EBacc and ABacc threatens the delivery and acquisition of a broad and balanced education and puts our creative economy and the creation of jobs in that sector at risk. I understand that computer science was included in the EBacc after substantial lobbying from the IT industry about the importance of computer science to the UK economy. The Arts should be considered on the same basis – there are over 2 million jobs in the Arts in the UK, and the Arts contribute over £60bn a year to the UK economy and £36.3bn in Gross Value Added (according to the Government’s own figures).\nHundreds of businesses, education and creative industry organisations have called for the Government to include creative subjects in the league tables and the absence of creative industry relevant subjects has been criticized explicitly by the CBI, Creative Industries Council, Royal Institute of British Architects, the Incorporated Society of Musicians, the Include Design campaign, Heads for the Arts, UK Music and BPI – the British Recorded Music Industry.\nPersonally, I am against the use of EBacc and ABacc as mechanisms for measuring the performance of schools, and the relevance of the ABacc appears particularly questionable. However I acknowledge that these are current government policy and my purpose in writing is to encourage you to ensure that these measures have the least damaging effect possible on Suffolk schools and children.\nAs a musician I have for many years volunteered in my children’s schools to assist them in providing enriching and enabling experiences through which children – regardless of their academic abilities or prior musical experience – can flourish. In the last two weeks alone I have accompanied children from Nayland Primary School in their performance at the Suffolk Schools Celebration of Music in Snape Maltings and directed a school choir at the Sudbury performing arts festival. Aside from my personal experience, there is a wealth of evidence that points to the advantages such opportunities give children – for example helping to develop confidence and self-esteem, and promoting collaboration. These aren’t just skills necessary for learning across the curriculum, they are also qualities employers seek.\nThese opportunities need to be provided across the school system, as children grow, not just in the early years. Yet the messages to schools from the Department for Education loudly and clearly suggest that creative arts subjects are additional and voluntary.\nPlease could you raise these concerns with the Prime Minister and Secretary of State and secure the place of creative industry relevant subjects in the EBacc and equivalent A-level league tables.\nI look forward to your reply.\nYours sincerely\nEmma Bishton”",
  "https_emmabishton_wordpress_com/https_emmabishton_wordpress_com_tag_musings-on-education/content_92.html": "I’ve just replied to the DfE consultation on the use of the Educational Services Grant (ESG), which the DfE wish to cut substantially. This grant is used to help fund a range of education-related services including pupil welfare, sports and music services. Local authorities don’t just use this grant to fund these services, they fund them from revenue budgets also. For music, the really damaging statement is this:\nOur expectation is that music services should now be funded through music education hubs (which can cover one or more local authority areas) and from school budgets, not from the ESG.\nDfE funding to music hubs (via the Arts Council) has already reduced. So where then should music hubs (which primarily provide services to schools) be getting their funds from? There’s no Big Society Donor out there that I can see, wanting to pay for millions of children to experience music-making. So this statement effectively legitimises local authorities from withdrawing all funds from music services, whether they are paid for through the ESG or any other funding stream. the ISM are leading a campaign: Protect Music Education and have led the charge for responses to the DfE consultation and helpfully provided a template response. Here’s what I sent: Dear Ms Barbour, I am responding to the Department for Education’s (DfE) consultation titled Savings to the Education Services Grant 2015-16 recommending that local authorities stop funding music services. The consultation includes the expectation that local authorities stop funding music services, stating “Our expectation is that music services should now be funded through music education hubs (which can cover one or more local authority areas) and from school budgets, not from the ESG”. I am asking for the Department for Education (DfE) to withdraw this expectation and instead recommend that local authorities continue to fund their music services. My response is solely concerned with the recommendations for funding music education and addresses questions 4 a, b and c.\nConsultation Question 4a Are there any reasons why local authority expenditure on central support services could not be significantly reduced, if not stopped altogether? Please give details below. Yes. National Plan The National Plan for Music Education sets out a vision for music education in England which depends on the combination of financial support of the Department for Education, schools and parents, and local authorities. In the foreword to this plan, this complex funding structure was recognised as was the interdependence between the different elements of the music education sector. The Department for Education has made public commitments to access to music specialists, saying ‘it is important that music education of high quality is available to as many [children] as possible: it must not become the preserve of those children whose families can afford to pay for music tuition. While music touches the lives of all young people, the disadvantaged can benefit most.’ This statement is particularly pertinent given recent reports from Ofsted that white working class children are achieving the lowest outcomes. Without music hubs providing services such as First Access class instrumental lessons (as they do in my LA, Suffolk), these children are significantly less likely to encounter opportunities for making music and its associated benefits if music hubs are not resourced to work in schools. The LA is in a position to mandate music hubs to direct use of LA funds to support disadvantaged children in particular. It should be encouraged to do so, not least because of the cognitive, emotional and social benefits that children derive from participating in music activities. (These benefits include developing skills which workplaces require, such as collaboration). The DfE, in reviewing the use of the ESG, could use this as an opportunity to direct LAs about their responsibilities in this area instead of appearing to legitimise withdrawal of services.\nThe Henley report recognised that primary schools teacher training does not equip trainee and NQT teachers with the skills and confidence to deliver on the music curriculum. And the vast majority of state schools have neither the expertise nor the specialist resources to deliver programmes like First Access in-house. The key to ensuring the quality and sustainability of musical opportunities for children is to ensure the continuation of national, local, school and parental funding for music education hubs which not only provide direct services but also support the school teaching staff.Funding National funding for music education hubs distributed via the Arts Council is already reducing from a high of £82.5 million in 2010-11 to just £58 million in 2014-15. If local authority funding is also lost, access to musical tuition and a good music education will become the preserve of a few (the most well-off) Further, the successful delivery of the National Plan for Music Education will be jeopardised.\n- LA funding to music hubs has already been cut by 1/3. Hubs received £14,344,043 from local authorities in 2012-13 despite pressure on local authority budgets (Source: Key data on Music education hubs 2013). In 2011-12 this figure was £21,288,142 (source R Hallam). The amount contributed by schools and parents has also declined. It is essential to note that much of the funding described as coming from schools actually comes from parents. For example I pay £80 per term for my son’s euphonium tuition. This is heavily subsidised by the school who pay roughly the same amount for each pupil learning an instrument with the music hub.\n- I understand that nationally, continuation following First Access opportunities has already dropped significantly. It would be jeopardised in many authorities by removal of LA funding, which would impact on disadvantaged children the most. These are the children who need additional funded support simply to receive the same opportunities as other children. Paying privately for lessons is simply not affordable for many parents.\n- Music makes a dramatic difference to children, academically, intellectually, socially and emotionally, as Darren Henley observed in his report and as explored in Professor Sue Hallam’s article The Power of Music, which summarises the evidence in support of music.\n- The creative industries are worth £36.3 billion a year to the UK and the music industry is worth between £3.5 billion and £3.8 billion (depending on the measure used). [Research by UK Music and PRS for Music.] There are 2million jobs in the Arts. Creative industries cannot be sustained only by retired people with disposable income; the sustainability of these industries rests on growing new audiences and new participants. To do this, children need to be inspired and engaged. In my local authority area for example, music and the arts are key to tourism as Suffolk is home to venues such as the internationally-renowned Snape Maltings (and Aldeburgh Festival), The Apex in Bury St Edmunds and DanceEast in Ipswich.\n- Two examples of what music hubs can do when appropriately funded and supported: currently all Suffolk state schools (regardless of whether they are involved in First Access or other programmes), are invited to perform in Snape Maltings every year in a week-long Schools Celebration of Music. Each year about 1600 primary and secondary school children from schools across the county (including special schools and alternative provision), participate. This event, which always succeeds in being inclusive yet highly professional, has been led for over 25 years by a partnership between the county music service and Aldeburgh music. I have seen for myself the enrichment this provides (these photos give an idea) and that is simply not available without the input and dedication of the music hub. Just this week I and other parents from my daughter’s class attended a concert put on by the music hub which brought together 300 children taking part in the First Access programme from local primary and special schools. The children spent the morning working together learning songs and instrumental pieces to perform together – being given the opportunity to collaborate, to listen, to experience the joy of performing. This is one of several such days the music hub puts on each year. We cannot afford, culturally or economically, to lose such opportunities.\n- In a recent poll, of those expressing an opinion, 85% of British adults back Michael Gove’s statement, taken from the foreword of the National Plan for Music, that ‘music education must not become the preserve of those children whose families can afford to pay for music tuition.’\n- More than 110 organisations from across the music industry are already backing the Protect Music Education campaign and have expressed concern at the recommendation from the Department for Education that local authorities cut their support for music services.\nConsultation Question 4b If you do not think this could be stopped altogether, how much of a saving could local authorities make to these services? If cost pressures on central support services have changed recently, please describe below.",
  "https_emmabishton_wordpress_com/https_emmabishton_wordpress_com_2015_07_19_pay-for-healthcare-lord-prior-we-already-do/content_56.html": "Below is an open letter to my MP, James Cartlidge, the Conservative MP for South Suffolk.\nDear James Cartlidge\nI understand that a few days ago the government health minister, Lord Prior, suggested during a Lords debate on the NHS that he would set up an inquiry into the future funding of the NHS. Apparently, now “demand outstrips supply” (as he put it) in the NHS, the inquiry needs to consider whether we need to move away from a tax-payer funded system to one based on insurance or other means of co-payment. I am writing to you as it seems to me that as citizens – and therefore as as taxpayers and NHS users – we should know whether Lord Prior was announcing government policy, or was going beyond his ministerial remit in proposing this debate. Yes the government needs to consider how to ensure the sustainability of the NHS in the short, medium and long-term. And yes as citizens we should engage to a degree in debates about priorities and the level of funding needed to meet them. But to have a minister announcing that an inquiry should be considering other forms of funding for the NHS – and explicitly, forms of funding which require those in need to pay – rather seems to give the game away.\nI’m currently working in a community dementia service. Such services (despite the consumerist language used by Lord Prior and countless others) are not driven by demand, they are driven by need; very high levels of need for complex, scary conditions we all hope we never have to face, which pose huge demands on families, services and social care. Yet last Friday, as I drove home from work in that dementia service, I listened to a news article that outlined why proposed government changes to uplift the cap on people’s contributions to the cost of their care can not now take place until 2020 because of the need to stabilise the social care crisis facing local authorities. This social care crisis isn’t a surprise: over the last few years the government has made local authorities the delivery agent for austerity, even though they are charged with looking after the most vulnerable people in society. Add to that the challenges of an increasing elderly population and the need for private care homes to make a profit, and a crisis is inevitable.\nIn 2011, David Cameron denied any suggestion that the NHS should move to an insurance-based system. If that is still his position why waste government time and resources on such an Inquiry? Good healthcare costs money, and we should not be shying away from that: a truly civilised society recognises need and seeks to meet it without punishing the people in need.\nThe people in the unit I’m working in aren’t choosing to be there. They may wish that their care could be more comprehensive, more holistic. But their basic reason for accessing care is need. They, as older people, belong to the group much vaunted by the government as having worked hard all their lives. Don’t they deserve better than a fight about who should be paying for their basic care? Such a fight puts the person needing care in an even more vulnerable position than they are in already.\nThe NHS Constitution clearly states that the NHS belongs to us all. It doesn’t belong to an insurance company, or any other kind of co-payment organisations. If this Inquiry gets underway, and as debates about the sustainability of the NHS proceed, please will you undertake to do the following:\n1) inform me if the Inquiry is part of government policy\n2) if it is not, ask questions and seek to ensure that such an Inquiry does not draw on government time and resources\n3) in the course of public debates give your assurance that you will support the fundamental principle of the NHS as a service funded through taxation, and that you seek to use all influence available to you as a Conservative MP to promote a tax-payer funded NHS.\nI look forward to hearing from you.\nyours sincerely\nEmma Bishton",
  "https_emmabishton_wordpress_com/https_emmabishton_wordpress_com_2013_06_09_putting-the-r-in-sre-why-i-wrote-to-my-mp-again/content_32.html": "Last night (before my MP was in the news for other reasons entirely) I joined many others across the country in emailing my MP to urge him to vote for the amendment to the Children & Families Bill being debated on Tuesday. This amendment would make PSHE and SRE education part of the statutory curriculum – much overdue, and very much needed. More information on the Consent to Consent campaign which led to this amendment being tabled is available here. Here’s what I wrote:\n8th June 2013\nDear Tim\nI am writing to ask your voting intention in regard to the amendment to the Children and Families Bill due to be debated this Tuesday, 11th June, and to urge you to vote in favour of the proposed amendment. As you are aware, the amendment proposes changes to the curriculum that would see the addition of PSHE to the National Curriculum, make age-appropriate Sex & Relationships education a statutory component of the curriculum at all four educational key stages, and specify that same-sex relationships, sexual violence, domestic violence and sexual consent be covered in the PSHE curriculum. Building on the reasons already articulated by the Coalition of Consent Campaign, there are four reasons why I believe this amendment is not only timely, but necessary:\nCurrently schools are only required to ensure that pupils understand how to use contraception and why it is important. They are not required to ensure that pupils understand the context in which contraception is used – i.e to help develop their understanding of healthy, appropriate and loving relationships. Nor are they required to ensure that children leave school understanding what constitutes a healthy diet, or able to address poor self-esteem and low confidence.\nAs a parent in your constituency, I am confident that the schools my children attend understand the importance of PSHE and SRE and also that they comprehend the necessary breadth of these subjects. But I am also very concerned about the context and culture within which these schools now operate; one where increasing test scores in core skills – important though this is – takes precedence over ensuring that children leave school as mature, confident citizens who can display both a love of learning and a readiness to take on the challenges of adult life. Anxiety about budgets and timetable capacity for key skills has, I understand, already led to schools in this region reducing pastoral support and PSHE provision. The proposed amendment would put PSHE and SRE back firmly within the school curriculum.\nThe UK Youth Parliament have made A Curriculum for Life (which includes compulsory PSHE, with a mandatory training programme for teachers), their priority campaign for 2013. They did this because they understand why pupils need to be taught vital life skills at school, and because they have first-hand experience of the wide variation between schools currently in terms of both the position of PSHE on the curriculum and the consequent quality of teaching provided. Responding to the UKYP by supporting this amendment would demonstrate that the government really is prepared to put service-users at the heart of policy-making.\nFinally, the educational case for including PSHE and SRE is clear. Pupils who demonstrate ‘risk behaviours’ (e.g. alcohol-misuse, unsafe sex, anti-social behaviours) are more at risk of school exclusion or truancy and less likely to achieve their potential. But pupils who are supported to achieve positive wellbeing (in relation to healthy lifestyles, emotional & mental wellbeing and relationships) demonstrate higher attainment. Evidence for this is provided by – amongst others – The Young Foundation in their report “Noticing the Change – a Framework of Outcomes for Young People in Practice” published in March this year.\nI look forward to the debate on Tuesday which is not only overdue but very much needed, and hope to hear that you have voted in favour of the amendment.\nyours sincerely\nPosted by Emma Bishton on 15 June 2013 at 5:31 pm\nUpdate: I have not had a reply from Tim Yeo as yet but it seems he did not vote in the debate. The amendment was a casualty of voting on government lines: only two coalition MPs – Julian Huppert (Cambridge) and Sarah Wollaston (Totnes) voted with Labour for the inclusion of mandatory PSHE, so the motion was not passed.",
  "https_emmabishton_wordpress_com/https_emmabishton_wordpress_com_2016_02_23_just-8-of-mps/content_28.html": "Last week I received an email from the Royal Statistics Society reporting on the results of their Parliament Counts campaign, aimed at promoting better-informed debate and decision-making in parliament. The Society were keen to help MPs understand both how to interpret statistical claims and how to use statistics themselves when setting out arguments. (As for why this is necessary, you need look no further than Jeremy Hunt’s attempts to mislead the public about weekend mortality rates, or Ian Duncan Smith’s insistence on changing benefits policy on the spurious grounds that if one person is cheating the system everyone else must be.)\nThe Statistics Society rightly recognises that MPs come from a range of backgrounds, and that most of them aren’t scientists (the group of people most likely to be well versed in using statistics and other forms of evidence to inform decision-making). In promoting statistical literacy the Society is also picking up on the expectation that politicians do as they claim to, – i.e. that they do actually use evidence to inform the policy decisions they make (or support or challenge, depending on their role). So before the 2015 General Election, they asked prospective MPs to sign up to their campaign, committing them to attend a training session if elected. 324 parliamentary candidates signed up to the campaign, of whom 55 were elected. That might sound good, but it’s only 8% of MPs. Or, to be more precise, 14% of Labour MPs and 4.5% of Conservative ones (and none in Suffolk, Essex or Norfolk or several other counties). So despite the best efforts of the Society, it doesn’t sound as if our politicians are likely to become more statistically literate any time soon. Nor does it appear as if they want to. That doesn’t augur well for evidence-based policy-making – and therefore for the rest of us.\nThere are of course some exceptions. Anyone hearing Sarah Wollaston (the former GP and MP who chairs the Commons Health Committee) talking on the Today programme last week about vaccination policy, will have been left in no doubt about both her ability and intent to use evidence to inform her judgements about policy even in the most emotionally charged of circumstances.\nI can’t help thinking that Sarah Wollaston must feel quite lonely at times in the House of Commons. Not only does she have to contend with being in a minority of MPs with any apparent willingness to learn how to use statistics appropriately in political discourse, she has to put up with her own side making bizarre decisions like the one made by David Cameron last week to deny young people compulsory sex education. As succinctly expressed by Bridget Christie in Saturday’s Guardian magazine, Cameron decided to ignore all the evidence from a very wide range of sources and deny young people compulsory sex education. Quite why is a mystery – even The Telegraph can’t find a meaningful counter-argument. And unfortunately debate on the subject has since sunk in the English Channel, along with most other items of news that don’t concern Britain’s membership of the EU.\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, David Cameron, Jeremy Hunt and Ian Duncan Smith aren’t on the list of MPs who attended the National Statistics Society training sessions. But given their actions, I wonder if next election we may need to set the bar rather lower. Asking prospective MPs to sign up to using and interpreting statistics appropriately may be several steps too far for politicians who don’t appear to wish to make judgements informed by evidence of any sort. But given the sheer disdain for data demonstrated by the likes of Jeremy Hunt in the last few weeks, it’s never been more important for MPs (on all sides) to be not just interested in evidence for itself, but statistically literate enough to use it to defend our public services.",
  "https_emmabishton_wordpress_com/https_emmabishton_wordpress_com_page_4/content_52.html": "Last Saturday evening we observed Earth Hour at home, doing dishes and playing a board game by candlelight with no recourse to anything electronic. All (except possibly the dishes) very sociable and cosy, no distractions from buzzing mobiles etc. Our quiet domestic effort was rather in contrast to the habit of international governments and big business these days which rather ostentatiously celebrate EarthHour with iconic pictures of dark cityscapes and the like. Whilst I don’t doubt their good intentions, you do rather get the sense that it is something to be seen to be doing (and therefore definitely not something to be avoiding). Businesses and governments wish to be seen (in the main) as responsible organisations, husbanding the world’s precious resources in our interests. But there is a bigger point to EarthHour. However much electricity we saved for an hour last Saturday evening, there’s really not much point if it doesn’t prompt us – as individuals, companies or governments, to try to reduce our electricity consumption for the other 8759 hours in the year. EarthHour is a small step taken in recognition of the beauty of our planet and the need to conserve its resources in our own interest, but even single steps need a destination.\nEarthHour is well advertised (for free) on large hoardings and through the media. Rather less visible are the campaigns to persuade business to take action against the deforestation due to mass production of palm oil.\nI’ve just signed a Greenpeace petition asking companies that use palm-oil (particularly three named multi-nationals: PepsiCo, Johnson& Johnson and Colgate-Palmolive) to improve their act on where and how they source palm oil, and how transparent they are about it. In the grand scheme of things we have to worry about, palm oil doesn’t sound all that important – or indeed all that exciting. It is a remarkably useful and ubiquitous substance used in up to half our household products.(Ironically it appears that you are as likely to find it in your toothpaste as in the biscuits you are seeking to protect your teeth from.) And it makes such products much cheaper to produce in large quantities. All that is needed for fast and large-scale production of palm-oil is heat and water – two substances naturally available in the world’s rainforests.\nBut growing it fast enough to respond to the demands of profit-motivated companies requires not just heat and water but cheap labour, making governments in some of the worlds poorer countries prey to the profit-motives of multi-national companies. So in the name of increased economic activity, rainforests are ransacked (well actually burnt to the ground), their inhabitants uprooted – with resulting risks of exploitation and child labour. The impact of rapid growth in large-scale production so far is that 90% of orang-utan habitats have been destroyed in the last 20 years, and Indonesia (a country you wouldn’t otherwise expect to be near the top of this particular league table) the third highest emitter of green-house gases in the world. The countries that use large quantities of palm oil – which include the US and the UK, don’t of course have any rainforests of their own. I can’t help feeling that if rainforests were as visible as, say, our stately homes, companies might get away with rather less than they do now.\n‘So what?’, you might say, ‘orang-utans are less important that humans and anyway we are protecting their future through breeding them in captivity’. Well I suppose that depends on your perspective, but what we often fail to notice is that what is bad for orangutans in the wild is also bad for humans. Left in zoos, orang-utans can’t contribute to the eco-system, and nor can all the other less famous (or attractive) inhabitants of the rainforest which are now threatened with extinction within the next few years. And – contrary to what we might like to think – climate change is a problem for us here and now. Rainforests without trees catch fire, increasing CO2 levels which impacts on rising sea-levels which in turn increase flooding across the world, including here in the UK. If we have wait for big business to pay enough tax from increased profits from biscuits and toothpaste in order that governments have the funds to buy more sandbags, we’ll all be losing out. As environmental scientist Carolyn Roberts, talking on BBC Radio 4’s “The Life Scientific” said this morning, when discussing our short-termist response to flood management in the UK: long-term action is essential because there is only one planet, and it has “no emergency exit”.\nPalm-oil seems to be me to be one of those small areas, like running fewer lights, where the actions of individuals can make a difference. (We do, after all, buy the products it is produced for). I know there is a view that signing petitions is a rather pointless activity, more likely to give the signatory a brief boost of morale than to effect real changes in policy. But arguably, petitions to businesses whose sole raison d’être is to sell us stuff, may have more effect. What business, after all, wants to be clearly identified on social media with practices which promote child labour, burn trees and destroy large numbers of cuddly-looking apes? These businesses are so vast that a few people choosing not to buy one of Colgate’s 44 types of toothpaste (yes really) won’t have much effect on them in time to save the rainforests. So whatever else you think about petitions, or about Greenpeace, I urge you, please, to take that step and sign.",
  "https_emmabishton_wordpress_com/https_emmabishton_wordpress_com_2013_12_08_councils-councillors-and-constituents/content_66.html": "On Monday I went to a seminar organised by the Centre for Mental Health on the Mental Health Challenge for local authorities. The point of the Mental Health Challenge is to assist local councils in opening up the discussion about mental ill-health and in taking actions that will help improve mental wellbeing for the community as a whole, as well as helping address the inequalities endured by those with mental health problems (the challenge is not about mental health services per se).\nThe first step for most councils (and one of the 10 parts to the Mental Health Challenge) is for each council to appoint a Mental Health Member Champion from amongst their councillors. So far there are fifteen Mental Health Champions, some from metropolitan and unitary councils and at least two from rural county councils.\nOn this occasion I had my ‘work hat’ on, so was not in activist mode. Because of the nature and purpose of the event, the councillors weren’t there with their political hats on either. Party politics wasn’t absent, but it wasn’t relevant either; the unifying ambition was better mental health for all, something which can’t be achieved by any one political party. As it happens, none of the fifteen member champions so far are LibDem, UKIP or Green: three are Conservative and 12 Labour.\nThe Mental Health Challenge is new and growing fast, so these numbers will change soon. But looking around me, and thinking of other times I have met councillors, I was struck by two things. The first is that more Labour councillors appear to have worked in the public or voluntary sectors – i.e. in environments or disciplines where talking about mental health is ‘okay’ – and it may perhaps be due to this that more Labour councillors and councils have sought to engage in this challenge so far. The second is that they looked like a cross-section of the population. Unlike the members of my county council in Suffolk, where most (54 out of 75) are white males – and most of these are retired.\nThe Suffolk population is not 72% retired white males. And nor for that matter is 77% of Norfolk’s population. So where are the women, the men and women of working age, and the men and women from black and minority ethnic groups in my council and other rural councils? Why can I see female (and male) councillors of working age in metropolitan councils, yet very few in rural ones? Is it simply that the Conservative & UKIP parties in rural areas tend to win more seats and membership of these parties is predominantly white retired males? Quite possibly. Is it also that retired business men (well, they mostly seem to be from business) want a retirement project which coincides with wanting to ‘give something back’ to the community? Possibly. Or is it that only retired men, for the most part, have the time and resources to travel across large rural areas, attending parish and town council meetings in addition to their county council business? I think so.\nRural counties, by their very nature, take a long time to drive through – even if just driving in to the middle for council meetings. Council meetings tend to take place during working hours. Add these two things together and it’s easy to see how incompatible being a councillor is with holding down a job, let alone adding in running a household (which, let’s face it, is still mostly done by women). So it’s hardly surprising there don’t seem (on first glance anyway) to be very many teachers, nurses and housing officers amongst our county councillors, or at least ones of working age. Yet these councils, like the metropolitan ones, are charged with improving the community’s health and wellbeing, something in my view which needs an empathetic understanding of the issues faced by all groups in the community.\nI’ve no doubt that the metropolitan councils face many of the same challenges as rural ones in encouraging residents to engage in local issues and of course actually persuading people to vote in the first place. But I can’t help wondering what it is that makes them appear – on the face of it, at least – to be more representative of the people they serve, and therefore more relevant to their communities.\nOther people have sought answers to this problem for a long time and whilst it’s clear that there are no quick answers, surely the questions have to include a re-evaluation of what rural county councils expect of their councillors? Representational balance is a long time coming, and it will take even longer if we don’t develop a deep enough understanding of the barriers for women, people of working age, and those from minority ethnic groups.\nIt does not surprise me that, when it comes to the Mental Health Challenge, there’s a lack of white retired males, though there is one notable exception. The very first member champion was Michael Bevan, a Conservative councillor from Dorset, who got the idea years ago and ran with it. Which just goes to show that one’s preconceptions – whilst often based on a reasonable premise – aren’t always borne out. Not when it comes to individuals, anyway.",
  "https_emmabishton_wordpress_com/https_emmabishton_wordpress_com_2017_09_03_top-of-what-exactly/content_50.html": "In the space of a week, the Guardian has done more to promote the future prospects of a group of pupils than their school has. Last Tuesday the Guardian revealed the pernicious practice by St Olave’s grammar school of discarding students at the end of year 12 if they look less than likely to achieve an A or B grade. By this morning, in the face of persistent negative headlines and a legal challenge, the Guardian and the BBC led with the story that St Olave’s had had a change of heart and invited those students whom they recently asked to leave, to remain at the school. So far so good. But whilst St Olave’s has taken the biggest hit, what’s become clear in the response to the Guardian article is just how many schools – including comprehensives – engage in similar practice, in order to keep results high.\nCriticism about the practice of discarding students at year 12 has been strong, along with condemnation of the obsession with league tables that drives it. But despite all this, the Guardian and the BBC have continued to describe St Olave’s as “the leading grammar”, a “top school” and so on. This kind of language is borrowed directly from the league tables the news story is decrying. Our collective understanding of these words in relation to schools is that they have the highest results (not hard to achieve if you select students in the first case like St Olave’s do, of course). But demonstrating how to destroy the self-esteem of 17 year olds isn’t my idea of showing leadership. The students concerned might be top of the discard heap, but that doesn’t make their school ‘top’ at anything other than protecting its own exam rating. Continuing to use this kind of language just perpetuates the idea that ‘top’ schools are those with the best results, not those best equipped to meet the needs of their pupils.\nThere’s talk of government having performance targets around retention in the sixth form, to dissuade schools from discarding students they don’t view as up to scratch. But that’s a sticking plaster, not a cure. (After all, Government aren’t minded to do anything other than pretend that all students will achieve A grades in schools kicked into gear by a dose of (un)healthy competition. Policies such as sixth form retention targets are just a defence in case of voter backlash when inevitable injustices occur.) What I think we need instead is a fundamental rethink about the purpose of education in the 21st century, with a concomitant change in thinking about how school success should be measured, and of the language used to do so. Here’s a start: my idea of an exemplary school is one which aims to demonstrates the capacity to respond to its pupils educational, emotional and social needs, and set them up for adulthood. A school requiring improvement would be one focused only on a single domain at the expense of others: that is to say, one not unlike St Olave’s.",
  "https_emmabishton_wordpress_com/https_emmabishton_wordpress_com_2016_09_20_whose-party-is-it-anyway/content_17.html": "Like several other local Labour Party members, I have spent a little time in the last couple of weeks putting leaflets through letter boxes in Hadleigh, as there is a County Council by-election on Thursday. Doesn’t sound all that exciting, I appreciate. But it matters. Not just because it matters anyway, but particularly because at the moment our county council (Suffolk) is one of those which is squirreling away reserves whilst cutting public services such as community transport, library funds and putting vulnerable elderly people into privatised but failing care homes. And there is always the possibility of a by-election getting the council to a tipping point where, with enough opposition, some of this damage can at least be paused, if not reversed.\nProtecting public services is the kind of result local people – of all political hues – generally want. Which is why many, more active, party members across the country get through a lot of shoe leather every week, pounding pavements and knocking on doors in attempts to persuade people of the case for voting Labour – or indeed for voting at all. (And despite the bad press given to most politicians, I think you’d be hard-pressed to find a committed member of any party who hasn’t done the same, in their attempt to persuade people that their answers to the big and little questions of public policy are the best solutions.)\nBut yesterday I hesitated before putting the leaflet through one of those letterboxes with a ‘No Junk Mail’ sticker. There are, sadly, many people who think that political communications are junk mail. Maybe they have bought into the discourse that all politically-active people are ‘in it for themselves’; maybe they just aren’t interested in much at all. Either way it’s a pretty sorry state of affairs. But if it is because they are disillusioned with the state of the debate at national level, I’m with them. I was actually rather relieved that no-one was about to talk to, as it’s rather embarrassing being in the Labour party at the moment.\nI’m a member of the party. That doesn’t make me a crazy Corbynista, a machiavellian plotter, an infiltrator or (what seems the worst insult of the moment) a ‘centrist’. It doesn’t make me a supporter of Momentum, nor does it make me proud of the MPs who decided that just when the country most needed strong opposition, they would create political havoc (all to no avail, it would appear) – even though, like them, I don’t think Jeremy Corbyn is the best person to lead the party. Like, I think, many thousands of party members, it makes me someone who wants Labour values to influence public and community life, and good left-wing policies in place at local and national level: things that make a positive difference to our lives and our children’ futures. But the present narrative in the mainstream media and the social media whirlwind is that Labour members are all new or old, democratic or anti-democratic, naive or selfish. There appears to be no middle ground. Well, I don’t want to be pigeon-holed, and nor do most of the people I know. Nor do I want to abandon the party just to get stuff done.\nA couple of weeks ago, I voted for Owen Smith. Not because he has all the answers, but because he at least represents an opportunity to start a new conversation. This time six years ago I was in the room at Labour party conference when Ed Miliband won his surprise victory. It’s no exaggeration to say the atmosphere was tense. I’d voted for him, for a number of reasons. And I know, it didn’t work out. Doesn’t look as if my candidate is likely to win this time round, but what is most frustrating is that whichever of them wins, neither of them is making things happen locally.\nThe everyday things that get discussed in councils – like whether 17-year-olds should have to pay to get to school, or which town can do without a fire engine – really do make a difference to people’s lives. The deeper that austerity bites, the harder it is for councillors (with the right values but the wrong budgets) to fight for the right answers. But the more we and the media focus only on the people at the top of the party, and on the splits in the party, the less room there is to actually discuss those issues and support the councillors and their supporters trying to stand up and make the right choices every day. Last week, the Labour opposition on the County Council proposed a motion aimed at improving the way elderly care home residents are treated in Suffolk – including the requirement that the county stop placing people in poorly-rated care homes. The Conservatives voted it down.\nThat by-election? It’s to replace a Conservative councillor who swanned off to live in the USA and refused, for eighteen months, to resign from his seat. The kind of self-serving caper that makes it into Private Eye, embarrasses even the Tories, and gives politicians of all hues a bad name. Whatever is going on in the national Labour Party on Thursday, and however it is played out through mainstream and social media, let’s hope the people of Hadleigh can see the wood for the trees and vote for the right candidate (which would be Sue Monks).",
  "https_emmabishton_wordpress_com/https_emmabishton_wordpress_com_page_7/content_105.html": "When campaigning in the west part of South Suffolk (Sudbury and the villages to the south and north of it), I found that many people, without prompting, expressed their concerns about the local Schools Review. The review means that the current 3-tier system (primary, middle and high schools) will change to a 2-tier one, phasing out middle schools.\nThis change was instigated by the Conservative-led county council, and was first introduced in a consultation back in 2007. I was a school governor at a primary school in Great Cornard at the time, and it struck me – and many others – that the consultation was designed to demonstrate the basis for the council’s (already made) decision, not in fact to ask for people’s views to help come to a conclusion. More of an opinion poll than a consultation.\nThe council argued that better exam results in 2-tier systems made the case for changing from three tiers. To my mind they failed to explore other ways of addressing this apparent inequality or to account properly in their calculations for the different demographics across the county versus the systems in place.\nI don’t really want to focus on the merits of 2-tier rather than 3-tier systems here, or indeed on the county’s current plans for the actual re-organisation. However a significant consequence of the reorganisation is that parent groups have sprung up in both Clare and Stoke-by-Nayland to campaign against the proposed closure of the middle schools in these locations.\nThese campaigns were given a new momentum and focus by the Tory proposals to introduce ‘Free schools’, much vaunted in the election campaign and now included in the Queen’s Speech, and the groups are now campaigning to set up 11-16 High schools as ‘Free Schools’ in both Clare and Stoke by Nayland.\nThe concerns and activities of these parent groups have energised many others, including local businesses and former pupils. As a parent of children set to go to one of these middle schools myself, I entirely understand both the wish for children to attend schools which are as local as possible, and the sadness about losing popular and effective local middle schools. I also cannot fault the determination of these parents to champion their children’s education. However I profoundly disagree that the re-establishment of these schools as ‘Free’ high schools is the answer.\nAs I understand it, the points in favour of establishing high schools in these locations are:\n- they would be small\n- they would be local\n- they promote choice\n- they would set their own curriculum\n- they would capitalise on the energy of the parents involved\n- they would draw on other community resources (independent schools, businesses) and be somehow appreciably ‘different’ from other state schools\nAs I indicated during the campaign, I disagree, and here’s why, taking each of these points in turn and then adding a couple more :\nSmall: is this inherently good? Is big bad? I think as parents we all want to feel that our children are known in their school, and so very big schools seem impersonal, and rather scary. Personally, I’d be uncomfortable with a school of 2000. However, it doesn’t follow that schools of 500 are intrinsically good unless they are good schools for all the other reasons that make schools good. (To my mind the factors that make the most of teachers’ skills and therefore enable the best learning by pupils include clear leadership, high expectations, effective pastoral care and engagement by parents).\nThe most important thing to note about small schools, is that in the state system (i.e. without ‘pupil premium’ paid for by parents), smaller schools are VERY unlikely to have sufficient income to have enough teachers to provide a wide range of subjects and activities, within and outside of the curriculum. There are very definitely economies of scale. Added to which, a school of around 1500 can easily have extremely good pastoral care and therefore knowledge of individual pupils if it is organised in a way which promotes this (houses within schools, for example).\nLocal: Yes – I like the idea of children travelling as short a distance as possible to school, for pastoral and environmental reasons and so that as parents we can be part of the community surrounding the school. But in a rural area, local is only going to be local to a very small group of people.\nChoice: Yes, I can see that a wider range of schools promotes choice and that can be a good thing. But only if all the schools have a fair chance to succeed, and this cannot happen if funding is squeezed (see ‘disadvantages’ below). Furthermore, I have visited all the high schools in South Suffolk during the campaign, and found each one not only to be good but to be discernibly different, not just because they have different specialisms but also because all schools have their own character and identity. We already have choice, but it should also be remembered that choice is only available to those who have the capacity to exercise it. Therefore, what we must promote first and foremost is excellence in all our catchment schools.\nCurriculum: After much focus on the fact that the curriculum had become too focused on academic studies and left out vocational ones, we now have a curriculum for 14-16s which is broad enough to provide for a range of interests, abilities and different career paths. Even without consideration for vocational courses, smaller schools simply will not have enough revenue funding to provide for a wide enough range of individual subjects taught by specialists. For example, three separate science subjects may not be possible. That limits pupil choice, both at GCSE and beyond.\nParental energy: The commitment and energy of the parents seeking to set up free schools locally is extraordinary. However, what happens when this cohort of children have left the schools and their parents move on to other things? Will parents of new pupils be required to help? And what will happen if they do not have the skills?\nIt is already possible to be very involved in schools, as governors, as mentors, as volunteers. I’m sure the other schools in this area would love to harness the energy and commitment of all parents – it’s not necessary to start a new school to be involved in our children’s education.\nDrawing on community resources: This is always a good thing, and it is vital that every school be viewed as part of the fabric of the community, gaining from the community and giving back to it. Sometimes this can be in very obvious ways, and one of the things that impressed me in visiting Suffolk high or upper schools was the use of sports facilities by the community. However, like parental involvement, we don’t need new schools to be established in order to welcome involvement from organisations and businesses in our communities, we can do this now.\nThere are also a couple of other very big disadvantages to the setting up of free schools:\nMoney: Unless there is in fact demand for places that are not already provided for by existing schools, the establishment of new ‘free schools’ would take pupils, and therefore funding, away from existing provision. This would disadvantage those schools and is simply not tolerable. Because of the Schools Organisation Review, there is a perception that this will not happen in Suffolk. However, if a school has a defined catchment now and another school is set up within that catchment, the existing school will lose pupils even though the changes made bringing in the 2-tier system increase the number of year-groups taught. The numbers of pupils gained do not make up for those lost to the new school.\nArguments put forward so far have seemed to me to focus on capital costs only, and of course these are a concern. However, revenue funding is what secures the school’s capacity to help pupils learn, and two competing schools in one catchment means less revenue funding for each school. Revenue funding includes paying for teachers, teaching assistants, pastoral care, heating bills and maintaining sports facilities. And that’s before other issues are considered, such as whether the county council will provide free bus transport for both existing schools and new free schools in an area.\nStandards: Where are the guarantees with Free schools that the quality of education sought will actually be provided? And what would happen to a Free school, and to the pupils in that school, if it failed to deliver?\nPerceptions of the existing schools: Schools, as with all public institutions, can lose ‘stakeholder’ trust and gain negative reputations faster than they can gain positive ones. Negativity is self-perpetuating. The act of promoting new schools as those that will meet parental expectations suggests (inadvertently or otherwise) that existing schools fail to do this. Recovery from this position is hard for the schools, for the pupils at those schools, and for the community in which those schools are based.\nTo sum up\nWhilst the suggestion to establish new schools can be made quickly, and sounds on the face of it a fantastic opportunity, it would take a very long time to undo the damage caused by setting them up. The idea is a bad one unless there is either additional funding around or increased demand for places; neither of these applies in South Suffolk, and I hope this post will help outline the reasons why I believe this.\nOur children don’t (or only rarely do) choose their schools, parents do. And despite the best of intentions, parents may in fact limit the choices available to all children in the area by setting up schools which disadvantage other schools and their pupils, all without giving any guarantee that the new schools will in fact offer what they would want.\nEstablishing new ‘free schools’ would disadvantage other schools and therefore other children. Our children’s futures cannot be secured in isolation from the system which our community needs to be built on. If the energy of the parents wanting closer involvement in their children’s schools could be harnessed in other ways, all our children would benefit.",

Their existence makes it hard for local authorities to plan school admissions. Given recent stories (which anyway just add to a body of evidence about their predecessor schools in Sweden and USA) they don’t appear likely to raise attainment. And they cost more than existing state schools do.\nThe Seckford Foundation Free Schools Trust, which opened two 11-16 free schools in Suffolk last year and are in consultation to open a third, in Ixworth, have always appeared keen to put these claims to the test. Despite widespread opposition (see James Hargrave’s blog for details) the Seckford Foundation have enthusiastically ploughed the DfE’s furrow, leading the way locally for an expansion of choice and independent sector engagement in state education. However, they have been surprisingly coy about the costs associated with their new schools.\nThe government is rightly keen that we should all care about public expenditure, and as you might expect, state schools are required to publish financial information for public scrutiny. Strangely, free schools do not seem obliged to follow the same rules. Seckford were in the news last year for opening new schools with so few pupils that it was very hard to understand how they could be solvent any time soon if funded by the usual per-pupil mechanism. Any other state school faced with the same financial pressures, under the usual rules, would surely be struggling to survive. (And given the surplus of school places in the area, it’s hard to see that financial pressures won’t result on at least the existing schools, if not the new ones.)\nSo, in the interests of transparency, I sent Seckford a Freedom of Information (FoI) request in July 2012 to find out about the financing of these new schools in Beccles and Saxmundham. I wanted to know the numbers registered, the numbers for which they were funded, the operating budgets for their first year (2012-13) and the costs of building works associated with turning their premises (former middle schools) into high schools.\nIn October 2012 they sent me a very scant reply in which they refused to provide all the information except the school numbers. So, following FoI procedure, I asked them to review their response. In November of that year they sent me a more detailed response, again outlining why they would not provide operating budgets or building costs but pointing out that their funding agreement had now been published. Again in accordance with FoI procedure, I reported them to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO). They then refused to provide the Information Commissioner with the information either, continuing to assert that commercial interests and intent to publish some of these figures (the building costs) in future meant that they were exempt from making the required information public.\nBy this time 8 months had elapsed since first submitting the FoI request. I then appealed to the ICO, which investigated my complaint. In September, the ICO published their decision, and gave their reasons, describing whether the exemptions employed by the Seckford Foundation were valid and if so, whether wholly or in part. Their conclusion was that Seckford should disclose information regarding operating costs within the next 35 days.\nIn other words, Seckford could continue to withhold information on the building costs as they intend to publish these in due course, but they were required to make public the operating costs of the school as the ICO had judged the release of this information to be in the public’s interest.\nSomewhat predictably, the Seckford Foundation haven’t disclosed the information within the required timeframe. Instead, they have appealed to the Information Commissioner’s Solicitors, and we won’t know the outcome of that for a while as at the very least it has to be considered by a tribunal ‘on paper’. It takes expertise to deal with these things. Expertise the taxpayer is funding even though state schools wouldn’t usually be hiding behind such systems in the first place.\nSo in summary, the Seckford Foundation Free Schools Trust is using public funding to provide state schools for pupils for whom as it happens there are already plenty of school places available. But Seckford doesn’t want to disclose how much it is being paid to provide these schools, and is going to great lengths – at taxpayers expense – to stop this information from being made public. We know that the Seckford Foundation charges day pupils between £13,470 and £14,400 per year at Woodbridge School, their pre-existing independent school, which is more than twice what high schools in Suffolk receive per pupil. But they don’t want to tell us what they get for their state school pupils. Whatever can they – or the DfE which is accountable for handing over the funding – have to hide?",

(And given the surplus of school places in the area, it’s hard to see that financial pressures won’t result on at least the existing schools, if not the new ones.)\nSo, in the interests of transparency, I sent Seckford a Freedom of Information (FoI) request in July 2012 to find out about the financing of these new schools in Beccles and Saxmundham. I wanted to know the numbers registered, the numbers for which they were funded, the operating budgets for their first year (2012-13) and the costs of building works associated with turning their premises (former middle schools) into high schools.\nIn October 2012 they sent me a very scant reply in which they refused to provide all the information except the school numbers. So, following FoI procedure, I asked them to review their response. In November of that year they sent me a more detailed response, again outlining why they would not provide operating budgets or building costs but pointing out that their funding agreement had now been published. Again in accordance with FoI procedure, I reported them to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO). They then refused to provide the Information Commissioner with the information either, continuing to assert that commercial interests and intent to publish some of these figures (the building costs) in future meant that they were exempt from making the required information public.\nBy this time 8 months had elapsed since first submitting the FoI request. I then appealed to the ICO, which investigated my complaint. In September, the ICO published their decision, and gave their reasons, describing whether the exemptions employed by the Seckford Foundation were valid and if so, whether wholly or in part. Their conclusion was that Seckford should disclose information regarding operating costs within the next 35 days.\nIn other words, Seckford could continue to withhold information on the building costs as they intend to publish these in due course, but they were required to make public the operating costs of the school as the ICO had judged the release of this information to be in the public’s interest.\nSomewhat predictably, the Seckford Foundation haven’t disclosed the information within the required timeframe. Instead, they have appealed to the Information Commissioner’s Solicitors, and we won’t know the outcome of that for a while as at the very least it has to be considered by a tribunal ‘on paper’. It takes expertise to deal with these things. Expertise the taxpayer is funding even though state schools wouldn’t usually be hiding behind such systems in the first place.\nSo in summary, the Seckford Foundation Free Schools Trust is using public funding to provide state schools for pupils for whom as it happens there are already plenty of school places available. But Seckford doesn’t want to disclose how much it is being paid to provide these schools, and is going to great lengths – at taxpayers expense – to stop this information from being made public. We know that the Seckford Foundation charges day pupils between £13,470 and £14,400 per year at Woodbridge School, their pre-existing independent school, which is more than twice what high schools in Suffolk receive per pupil. But they don’t want to tell us what they get for their state school pupils. Whatever can they – or the DfE which is accountable for handing over the funding – have to hide?",

The countries change colour when I fill it with something hot, becoming anything from green to dark red in accordance with the carbon dioxide emissions of each country. It’s a reminder of the fact that those countries which burn most fossil fuel per person – e.g. USA and China – are contributing a disproportionate amount to global warming.\n‘Green issues’ have been in the news quite a bit of late. To start with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published its latest report on climate change, in which the scientists stated that they are 95% certain that humans are responsible for climate change and that we need to take action globally now. The publication was accompanied by much dissent from those who disagree (most of whom aren’t scientists). I can understand why people are unenthusiastic about it: climate change is ‘inconvenient’. But finding it difficult to adapt is reasonable; continuing to argue the case in the face of an overwhelming scientific consensus just because our position is unpalatable, is not.\nIf we are going to lessen the impact of climate change on the next generation we need to heed the message of the IPCC scientists and change our behaviours. That’s hard for pretty much everyone. But it is necessary.\nWe’ve known for many years that smoking, diet and lack of exercise contribute to heart disease, one of the UK’s biggest killers. And, faced with a diagnosis of heart disease, people don’t usually question advice that they give up smoking or adapt their diet – however difficult it is to do in practice. Doctors are scientists, and we trust them to advise us, even if the message they bring is sometimes difficult to hear. So what is so different about climate scientists and their advice to reduce the burning of fossil fuels?\n‘Green issues’ have remained in the media since the IPCC report, but not for good reasons. Interest in the IPCC report gave way to party conferences, talk of fuel bills and the merits of paying energy companies for investment in renewable energy. Sadly our government, instead of dealing with increasing energy bills and the profit motive that drives them, seems all too happy to blame renewables for rising costs. So much for listening to the scientists. Cameron et al seem to be so busy celebrating the possibility of a new nuclear power plant that will cost billions yet provide only 7% of the UK’s energy requirements that they haven’t noticed Denmark is on target to generate a whacking 50% of its energy needs from wind power by 2020.\nMost weeks, my local paper carries a story about a proposal for renewable energy in some form. I do accept that some people see renewables as visually undesirable, but they are safe, clean, and future-proof. Fossil fuels, on the other hand, are dangerous (witness the anniversary of the Senghenydd colliery disaster in the news last week), dirty, running out and contributing to global warming.\nTo end on a positive note, I buy my electricity from Ecotricity – which sources all of its power from renewables. It has just broken its pricing link with ‘the big six’ and has put its prices down. Despite all the press to the contrary, it seems there really is room for a different way of doing things. The more energy companies source from renewables, the better off we will all be.",
  "https_emmabishton_wordpress_com/https_emmabishton_wordpress_com_tag_what-do-i-think/content_104.html": "When campaigning in the west part of South Suffolk (Sudbury and the villages to the south and north of it), I found that many people, without prompting, expressed their concerns about the local Schools Review. The review means that the current 3-tier system (primary, middle and high schools) will change to a 2-tier one, phasing out middle schools.\nThis change was instigated by the Conservative-led county council, and was first introduced in a consultation back in 2007. I was a school governor at a primary school in Great Cornard at the time, and it struck me – and many others – that the consultation was designed to demonstrate the basis for the council’s (already made) decision, not in fact to ask for people’s views to help come to a conclusion. More of an opinion poll than a consultation.\nThe council argued that better exam results in 2-tier systems made the case for changing from three tiers. To my mind they failed to explore other ways of addressing this apparent inequality or to account properly in their calculations for the different demographics across the county versus the systems in place.\nI don’t really want to focus on the merits of 2-tier rather than 3-tier systems here, or indeed on the county’s current plans for the actual re-organisation. However a significant consequence of the reorganisation is that parent groups have sprung up in both Clare and Stoke-by-Nayland to campaign against the proposed closure of the middle schools in these locations.\nThese campaigns were given a new momentum and focus by the Tory proposals to introduce ‘Free schools’, much vaunted in the election campaign and now included in the Queen’s Speech, and the groups are now campaigning to set up 11-16 High schools as ‘Free Schools’ in both Clare and Stoke by Nayland.\nThe concerns and activities of these parent groups have energised many others, including local businesses and former pupils. As a parent of children set to go to one of these middle schools myself, I entirely understand both the wish for children to attend schools which are as local as possible, and the sadness about losing popular and effective local middle schools. I also cannot fault the determination of these parents to champion their children’s education. However I profoundly disagree that the re-establishment of these schools as ‘Free’ high schools is the answer.\nAs I understand it, the points in favour of establishing high schools in these locations are:\n- they would be small\n- they would be local\n- they promote choice\n- they would set their own curriculum\n- they would capitalise on the energy of the parents involved\n- they would draw on other community resources (independent schools, businesses) and be somehow appreciably ‘different’ from other state schools\nAs I indicated during the campaign, I disagree, and here’s why, taking each of these points in turn and then adding a couple more :\nSmall: is this inherently good? Is big bad? I think as parents we all want to feel that our children are known in their school, and so very big schools seem impersonal, and rather scary. Personally, I’d be uncomfortable with a school of 2000. However, it doesn’t follow that schools of 500 are intrinsically good unless they are good schools for all the other reasons that make schools good. (To my mind the factors that make the most of teachers’ skills and therefore enable the best learning by pupils include clear leadership, high expectations, effective pastoral care and engagement by parents).\nThe most important thing to note about small schools, is that in the state system (i.e. without ‘pupil premium’ paid for by parents), smaller schools are VERY unlikely to have sufficient income to have enough teachers to provide a wide range of subjects and activities, within and outside of the curriculum. There are very definitely economies of scale. Added to which, a school of around 1500 can easily have extremely good pastoral care and therefore knowledge of individual pupils if it is organised in a way which promotes this (houses within schools, for example).\nLocal: Yes – I like the idea of children travelling as short a distance as possible to school, for pastoral and environmental reasons and so that as parents we can be part of the community surrounding the school. But in a rural area, local is only going to be local to a very small group of people.\nChoice: Yes, I can see that a wider range of schools promotes choice and that can be a good thing. But only if all the schools have a fair chance to succeed, and this cannot happen if funding is squeezed (see ‘disadvantages’ below). Furthermore, I have visited all the high schools in South Suffolk during the campaign, and found each one not only to be good but to be discernibly different, not just because they have different specialisms but also because all schools have their own character and identity. We already have choice, but it should also be remembered that choice is only available to those who have the capacity to exercise it. Therefore, what we must promote first and foremost is excellence in all our catchment schools.\nCurriculum: After much focus on the fact that the curriculum had become too focused on academic studies and left out vocational ones, we now have a curriculum for 14-16s which is broad enough to provide for a range of interests, abilities and different career paths. Even without consideration for vocational courses, smaller schools simply will not have enough revenue funding to provide for a wide enough range of individual subjects taught by specialists. For example, three separate science subjects may not be possible. That limits pupil choice, both at GCSE and beyond.\nParental energy: The commitment and energy of the parents seeking to set up free schools locally is extraordinary. However, what happens when this cohort of children have left the schools and their parents move on to other things? Will parents of new pupils be required to help? And what will happen if they do not have the skills?\nIt is already possible to be very involved in schools, as governors, as mentors, as volunteers. I’m sure the other schools in this area would love to harness the energy and commitment of all parents – it’s not necessary to start a new school to be involved in our children’s education.\nDrawing on community resources: This is always a good thing, and it is vital that every school be viewed as part of the fabric of the community, gaining from the community and giving back to it. Sometimes this can be in very obvious ways, and one of the things that impressed me in visiting Suffolk high or upper schools was the use of sports facilities by the community. However, like parental involvement, we don’t need new schools to be established in order to welcome involvement from organisations and businesses in our communities, we can do this now.\nThere are also a couple of other very big disadvantages to the setting up of free schools:\nMoney: Unless there is in fact demand for places that are not already provided for by existing schools, the establishment of new ‘free schools’ would take pupils, and therefore funding, away from existing provision. This would disadvantage those schools and is simply not tolerable. Because of the Schools Organisation Review, there is a perception that this will not happen in Suffolk. However, if a school has a defined catchment now and another school is set up within that catchment, the existing school will lose pupils even though the changes made bringing in the 2-tier system increase the number of year-groups taught. The numbers of pupils gained do not make up for those lost to the new school.\nArguments put forward so far have seemed to me to focus on capital costs only, and of course these are a concern. However, revenue funding is what secures the school’s capacity to help pupils learn, and two competing schools in one catchment means less revenue funding for each school. Revenue funding includes paying for teachers, teaching assistants, pastoral care, heating bills and maintaining sports facilities. And that’s before other issues are considered, such as whether the county council will provide free bus transport for both existing schools and new free schools in an area.\nStandards: Where are the guarantees with Free schools that the quality of education sought will actually be provided? And what would happen to a Free school, and to the pupils in that school, if it failed to deliver?\nPerceptions of the existing schools: Schools, as with all public institutions, can lose ‘stakeholder’ trust and gain negative reputations faster than they can gain positive ones. Negativity is self-perpetuating. The act of promoting new schools as those that will meet parental expectations suggests (inadvertently or otherwise) that existing schools fail to do this. Recovery from this position is hard for the schools, for the pupils at those schools, and for the community in which those schools are based.\nTo sum up\nWhilst the suggestion to establish new schools can be made quickly, and sounds on the face of it a fantastic opportunity, it would take a very long time to undo the damage caused by setting them up. The idea is a bad one unless there is either additional funding around or increased demand for places; neither of these applies in South Suffolk, and I hope this post will help outline the reasons why I believe this.\nOur children don’t (or only rarely do) choose their schools, parents do. And despite the best of intentions, parents may in fact limit the choices available to all children in the area by setting up schools which disadvantage other schools and their pupils, all without giving any guarantee that the new schools will in fact offer what they would want.\nEstablishing new ‘free schools’ would disadvantage other schools and therefore other children. Our children’s futures cannot be secured in isolation from the system which our community needs to be built on. If the energy of the parents wanting closer involvement in their children’s schools could be harnessed in other ways, all our children would benefit.",
  "https_emmabishton_wordpress_com/https_emmabishton_wordpress_com_2013_03_04_spoilt-for-choice/content_97.html": "In thinking more about how to measure schools, and what should be measured, I’ve been looking through a couple of existing websites dedicated to reviewing schools – Schools.net and The Good Schools Guide. The latter follows a set procedure and reviews schools – mostly independent schools – from a parent perspective, and looks at the school as a whole, rather than just at academic results. Schools.net, on the other hand, is an open space where parents or others can submit reviews of schools they know – as there is no set review procedure these reflect personal experiences. These websites clearly serve a market, and it’s good that parents should get more of a feel for the schools they are considering than can ever be gained from reading an Ofsted report or a league table. The problem with these sites for me, though, is that they start from the assumption that as parents we should be ‘shopping around’ for the right school for our children. Shopping around makes sense when paying for a private education – in the same way that it makes sense when choosing a house to live in. And it is of course true that each school (whether state or private) has its own culture and all children are different – so by implication, some children will thrive more easily in some schools than in others. But is extending the choice of schools available really the answer to making sure that our state schools can provide most effectively and consistently for our children?\nIt seems to me that pursuing Choice as driver of the system just increases people’s dissatisfaction with the provision which already exists, by making us focus on what we might have, rather than on whether what we are offered is appropriate. I appreciate that one of the reasons for pursuing increased choice in the system is to increase diversity of provision and raise standards through encouraging people to engage more with the services they are using. But by definition, an education system cannot provide an tailored individual experience for each child; yet proposing a consumer model makes us expect just that and feel dissatisfied when what we want is not available. No-where is this dissatisfaction – and its consequences – clearer than in Suffolk.\nEducation results in Suffolk – both at Key stage 2 and at GCSE – have been considerably below where they might reasonably be expected to be, given the demographics of Suffolk, for some time now – as any follower of the local media will be aware. There is much speculation as to why; reasons put forward (singly or as contributing factors) include low funding per capita, low aspiration (parental and school), poor LEA leadership, the 3-tier school structure (primary, middle and upper schools). Alongside repeating that “it is not good enough” (as if stating the obvious actually facilitates improvement), the LEA have responded to this position by effecting the wholesale (and largely unpopular) closure of middle schools, and commissioning the RSA to lead a review.\nSet school performance in Suffolk against the national political backdrop of constant denigration of our schools, and the result is fairly widespread anxiety amongst parents whose children are yet to go through school. The consequence here in Suffolk? Twenty bids to the DfE to set up free schools, over three ‘waves’ of applications (one special school – which is needed – has been approved as have four 11-16 schools in the grounds of former middle schools – all additional provision). Note this figure does not include any bids submitted in the 2013 application round, and one (a Steiner-influenced school) is now on its fourth bid to the DfE. These bids are all on the the list finally published by the DfE last week, as a result of the British Humanist Association’s persistent efforts to force the DfE to act more transparently in regard to free school applications. To put this in context, there was only one free school proposal for Essex (which also has below-average GCSE performance) over the same time period.\nBy any standards, this is a high level of free school activity in a county with an ageing population and a large surplus of school places already. And all these proposals do (bar those for special/alternative provision) is extend choice for parents. They make no attempt to improve the system as a whole (this is not their intention, I appreciate). Nor, as I’ve outlined previously on this blog, do they provide the kind of breadth of educational offer that will provide our children with the choices they need. Instead they seek to provide brief respite for a minority of parents in this dissatisfied world where the expression of the right for individual choice obscures what it is that we really need our school system to deliver, and how to achieve it.\nTurning back to my starting point, I can’t help thinking that we are setting our schools up to fail before we have even started, by reducing discussion about them to a narrow set of criteria which are fairly easily measurable – and rarely placing this in context anyway. Existing schools can fail to live up to expectation in accordance with the measured criteria, but new schools and proposed schools have no track record on these same criteria so can’t fail. And, except for those few state schools which have been reviewed by the Good Schools Guide, there’s no other point of reference in reports currently that enables us to understand something of the experience of being at a particular school and how our local school compares on these grounds with other schools. The result, in Suffolk at least, is more parents seeking personalised provision, but no more clarity about why our existing schools aren’t living up to expectation or how to help them do so. I believe that if we were having a proper debate about what our existing local schools do (in total, not just in tests) and how we as parents contribute to our children’s schools to increase our satisfaction with them, we would then be monitoring our schools to ensure that they are delivering what is needed – not finding reasons for going elsewhere.",
  "https_emmabishton_wordpress_com/https_emmabishton_wordpress_com_2016_05_09_what-price-progress/content_37.html": "Spoiler alert: there’s no humour in this post.\nThis morning, my eleven-year old daughter was in tears as she prepared to go to school (which has never happened before). Like many year 6 children she is anxious to do her best, and frightened of being made to repeat the tests (a peculiar proposal for the government to put forward if the tests really are about measuring the system not the pupils, as Nick Gibb tried to suggest last week). She is at a great school, with encouraging and experienced teachers who, I am very confident, will do their utmost to make the week as relaxed as possible. But that won’t take away the essential problem – that she, her friends and her teachers are being used by government as pawns to test the UK system against a few select international competitors. Which isn’t a very healthy position for any of the individuals concerned.\nThere is, of course, a big difference between feeling temporarily stressed and having a diagnosed mental health problem, but the two can be related, and it made me think about the potential for schools (as agents for education policy and independently of it) to contribute both positively and negatively to children’s mental health and wellbeing.\nOver the last five years, there has been a significant increase in the numbers of children and adolescents with mental health problems, and a consequent increase in referrals to specialist services, resulting in frustration and anxiety for young people and their parents who need help at the point of referral, not several months down the line. (For more information see for example this report by Centre Forum.) To try and cope with the rising demand on Child & Mental Health Services (CAMHS), government identified £1.25 billion for ‘transforming’ CAMHS services so that by 2020 they are more accessible, more responsive and better able to cope with rising demand.\nThat might sound like a lot of money, but once you spread the money over five years and then start costing out services across the country, it’s still going to be a huge challenge for local services to meet the rising need. And part of that rise is the government’s own fault.\nJust as you don’t have search far for a story about a young person struggling to access the counselling or other mental health help they need, you don’t have to look far for stories about the emotional and psychological impact on pupils of the government’s policies for increasing school test results. Here’s one, for example, on the Let Our Kids be Kids site.\nThe Centre Forum report suggests that 3 pupils in every class need mental health services or at the very least some additional support. So in a joined-up system you might think that schools would be supported to link up with local mental health services (many schools in the past have had CAMHS workers embedded in schools which has worked well for all concerned), or would have counselling provision that can link up with those services. You might also expect that local authorities or academy trusts would be required to monitor and check that such support is in place. But no. Some schools have pupil wellbeing firmly on their agenda, provide support in-house and make such links as far as is possible given the constraints on services (I’m pleased to say my son’s school, Thomas Gainsborough, held a parents information event recently following on from PSHE days on emotional wellbeing and mental health). But other schools don’t, because they are too fearful of failing to comply with the government requirement that test results go up. And fear is not a positive motivator.\nSchools with results above the required level have a bit of breathing space (though I grant you, it may not feel like it). Schools with falling results – or even results which stay fairly constant – have no room whatsoever. And the consequence? Often, sadly, a relentless focus on tests and testing at the exclusion of creative arts, sporting activities – and crucially, support services for pupils who are struggling. And the academy system just makes this worse. The lack of accountability of academies to parents and local authorities increases the ‘freedom’ of academies to impose actions which are not supported by parents, not good for pupil’s emotional or psychological wellbeing, and even not likely to improve outcomes (i.e. don’t follow the evidence-base). And sadly there are academies and academy chains out there that seem hell-bent on driving through mechanistic measures to improve results without consideration of the impact on pupil wellbeing or of the ramifications of losing parent support for the school’s actions. An example I heard recently really brought this home.\nA couple of weeks ago I attended a campaign meeting about the Education White Paper, and heard a parent speak with clarity and passion about changes imposed in her daughters (secondary) school since a recent downturn in GCSE exam results. Whilst still officially a ‘Good with outstanding features’ school (that is, it hasn’t had an Ofsted visit since results went down), the school now appears to be in panic mode, and its actions don’t, at least on the face of it, appear likely to improve either the exam results or the wellbeing of pupils. It has instigated some very victorian practices such as making all year groups (yes even the 15 year olds) line up before school, and withdrawing the morning break. Another of the ‘solutions’ it has put in place is to publish pupils’ test results for each year group. So exams are no longer used to inform pupils, parents and teachers of how pupils are doing (nothing new in that, after all), but to rank pupils – and then to display that information for anyone in school to see. When challenged, the school explained that this practice was used in another academy in the same chain. They either did not or could not explain why it was supposed to be helpful in that original school, or how they expected it to work in one with a significantly more diverse intake.\nI’m aware that pupils often know quite a bit about how they perform relative to their peers. But that is not at all the same as having that information bandied about publicly for all outside their immediate peer group to see – and potentially to misuse. And how public shaming (which is what it can amount to for some) is supposed to be motivational is beyond me. Instead, it’s all too easy for pupils to lose self-esteem and motivation – as the parent I heard testified, with the example of another pupil who has now left the school.\nAll this, whilst seeming unlikely to have a positive impact on exam results, is very likely to create demand for child and adolescent mental health services. An increasing emphasis on a school culture based on stick and no carrot, combined with a lack of time for PHSE and a failure to value constructive relationships with parents, almost certainly goes against what most schools would be wanting to achieve if they really had the freedom to act in their pupil’s best interests.\nThere is plenty of evidence linking increased pupil wellbeing to educational attainment (or in other words better exam results). And there’s no shortage of best practice about how to support schools to recognise young people in need of help and liaise effectively with the right services. So you might expect the government, faced with rising demand for CAMHS services, to take the opportunity in the CAMHS transformation funding to ensure that local authorities (which are responsible for these services at school level) are both required and resourced to put such services in our schools. But instead they have cut funding to local authorities. And I notice that wellbeing of young people doesn’t feature in the governments (very short) list of things that local authorities will remain responsible for if their White Paper gets through parliament.\nIt is tempting to accuse the government of caring only about exam results and not about the wellbeing of the pupils concerned – that is, to have no capacity or interest in assessing the impact of the processes used to achieve that goal on pupils’ emotional and psychological health. But it could be more accident than design. Either way, the government’s Department for Education appears entirely disconnected from the Department of Health. As a consequence schools in general are deprived of the support and services they need to respond to the needs of their pupils, and schools that are paralysed by the fear of exam failure are reduced to implementing draconian measures in the hope of shaming pupils to better results – and not even then held accountable for these actions to parents. Not only is all this bad for young people and their families, it will cost us all more in the long term.\nPosted by Emma Bishton on 9 May 2016 at 4:33 pm\nRescue our Schools have today put out a petition to Jeremy Hunt to get the ball rolling, available here https://www.change.org/p/jeremy-hunt-mp-secretary-of-state-for-health-it-s-time-to-monitor-our-schoolchildren-s-emotional-wellbeing Please sign and share.",
  "https_emmabishton_wordpress_com/https_emmabishton_wordpress_com/content_1.html": "I’m a core member of the parent campaign group Rescue our Schools. We campaign for changes in our education system so that our children can be equipped with the skills and attributes necessary for life in the 21st century, and their schools and teachers have the resources and respect required for this to happen. We have a six-point manifesto for change in our education system, and I spent a couple of days this week reviewing just how the Department for Education has fared against these in the last year. Caution: it makes for unhappy reading. But it is also a call to action. 2019 is the year we must see positive change for our schools, our children and our future.\n- Invest in all our futures\nRequires improvement. The Department began the year with a new Education Secretary, Damian Hinds. Unlike his predecessor, Justine Greening, he came as a supporter of grammar schools (presumably one of the reasons he was appointed). Other than occasional announcements like the recent ones that children should climb trees (there’s an idea we’d never have thought of!) and that schools should reduce single-use plastics (they have, after all, nothing else to do), little else has changed. Education policy continues to be dominated by three things: a refusal to acknowledge that schools and early years settings need more funding to do the job asked of them, the desire to push testing to extremes and in doing so prioritise the able over the less able, and the continued marketisation of schools achieved by the ongoing push of schools away from local authorities and into academy chains. The recruitment and retention of staffing in schools, meanwhile, remains at crisis point.\nOur Christmas message in 2017 focused on funding and the rising pressures on schools seeking to accommodate the increase in cost pressures affecting our schools. How depressing, then, to still be leading on this a year later. And this despite the unprecedented sight, in September, of 2000 headteachers protesting ‘relentlessly reasonably’ on Whitehall, followed in October by a campaign organised by our sister campaign group Save our Schools in which pupils directly addressed MPs in parliament. After months of campaigning there was, in December, one important and welcome announcement: an increase in high needs funding for children with special educational needs and disabilities. This will help some children, but it isn’t enough. And it doesn’t begin to address the core funding problems facing schools across the country, many of which are having to ask parents to fund pencils and paper (the kind of thing Philip Hammond presumably had in mind when he talked about schools needing those ‘little extras’!).\n2. Promote inclusive education for all\nFail. Changes to funding for local authorities, combined with funding pressures on school budgets, have made it extremely difficult for schools to meet the needs of children with special education needs – a situation which not only discriminates against children with additional needs and their families; it potentially harms all children. Yet the level of need is clear; as of this year, 14.6% of pupils are on the SEN register. They are failed not only by inadequate levels of support (cost pressures reducing access to teaching assistants, for example), but also by the increased focus on exams and testing. Our own survey about the new GCSEs highlighted the punitive and emotionally devastating impact of the new exam regime for pupils with special educational needs such as autism. Meanwhile some parents are having to crowd-fund legal action in order to secure the required specialist support for their children from local authorities. The playing field is now so far from level that it is ceasing to offer many children an opportunity to play at all.\n3. Promote education over exam factories\nHard to know where to start, in the year that pupils sat the new GCSEs and A levels which are based almost exclusively on exams designed to favour those with good memories and high literacy skills, and in which primary schools started piloting baseline testing in reception. RoS had a busy summer surveying parents and teachers about the impact of the new GCSEs, and in ongoing campaigning with fellow organisations as part of More than a Score, seeking to reform SATs and end the link between test results and school accountability. (Have a look at this video about the #BigSATsSitIn – you can also sample the tests for yourself!) The impact of testing on pupil wellbeing has been questioned over and over again, in a year which also saw independent evidence of the rise of mental ill-health and poor emotional wellbeing in children and young people. RoS’ petition to address this was endorsed by Natasha Devon, former government mental health champion, amongst others. As the year drew to a close, the former head of the civil service added his voice to those concerned about the long-term impact on our children’s wellbeing. We will continue to campaign loudly and vigorously on this in 2019.\n4. Develop Creativity in all its forms\nAnother fail. Not surprisingly, given the pressure on resources and the perpetual drive from ministers to prioritise testing in traditional academic subjects (in SATs and by use of the Ebacc) over giving pupils a broad educational experience. Over the year, we have been able to highlight on social media work done in some of the most creative – and successful – schools bucking the trend, both in terms of access to arts subjects and activities, and creative approaches to teaching and learning overall.\nThe UK has traditionally excelled in the creative industries. Yet 2018 saw another year-on-year reduction in access to arts subjects throughout the curriculum, in GCSE entries for subjects such as music, drama, art, design technology and more, and consequently in employment of teachers in these subjects. In 2019 we need your help to promote this message all the more, before the situation becomes irreversible.\n5. Let expert evidence inform policy\nNo progress. There are many experts. There are many policy makers. But the one rarely seems to inform the other, except occasionally when referring to evidence that supports ideas currently in fashion in the DfE (those that support the use of synthetic phonics, for example).\nOne of the areas in which the evidence is overwhelming clear is that grammar schools do not improve attainment overall. Yet this year we have seen funding prioritised to expand grammar schools on the grounds that these schools will justify the increase in funding by widening access to pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds. Meanwhile, organisations such as the Education Policy Institute have published more evidence on the attainment gap for pupils on free school meals, and NHS research documented an increase in mental ill-health in young people While the government prioritises resources on pursuing a grammar school agenda not backed up by evidence, some schools are having to team up with local charities to provide breakfast clubs for children in poverty.\n6. Ensure local accountability for all schools\nAgain, there have been no shortage of concerns and failures in Multi Academy Chains, and both the Parliamentary Accounts Committee and the Education Select Committee have been increasingly critical of the problems with the Academies model. Stories range from the failure of a whole MAT, the rise of fixed-term exclusions, prescriptive teaching, high levels of executive pay, and significant concerns about misuse of funds. Thanks to BBC’s Panorama programme, the pitfalls of the Multi Academy Trust model and its associated lack of oversight are now much better understood. We will continue to provide a platform on social media for local campaigns fighting forced academisation. But we also must acknowledge that local authorities are now considerably under-resourced to support schools, even where those schools remain in LEA control.\nAs the new year approaches, so does a new Ofsted accountability framework The headlines suggest they want to change the current focus on data, involve teachers and assess the breadth and substance of the curriculum in schools. We at RoS are parents – we understand the value of meaningful, robust and consistent assessment of how schools are meeting our children’s needs, and want to be sure our teachers and school leaders are appropriately supported. But changing the framework alone doesn’t give schools the resources, creative freedom and evidence they need to develop the education Ofsted claims to want to evaluate. Moreover there are worrying signs that the inspectorate may be moving towards directing schools ‘how‘ to teach – with an emphasis on memorising rather than acquisition of skills. Such a narrow view of education would only let children down and, if introduced, must be emphatically resisted. As we have done with previous consultations, RoS will be asking for your thoughts to inform our response when the consultation on the new framework is published in early 2019.\nOverall Assessment\nThroughout the year, the Department for Education has plunged deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole, in a constant bid to find its own alternate reality universe in which school budgets really are at a record high and standards really have been raised equitably with a meaningful impact on pupils’ futures. Whilst it has being doing this, the UK Statistics Authority has found cause to write to the DfE no fewer than FOUR times in 2018 about misleading use of education statistics. With all government stagnating due to Brexit, the DfE appears to find its own version of the Mad Hatters tea party quite a comforting place to be. But schools, pupils and parents do not.\nOur Rescue our Schools message for 2019 is clear: the children and young people in school now cannot afford to wait another year for the government to wake up to its own responsibilities. We must join together, and act."
