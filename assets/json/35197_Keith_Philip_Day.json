The highest speed recorded was an incredible 70mph.\nWe were close to one of the bus stops where pedestrians cross regularly.\nThe risk of a person dying after being hit by a car at 42mph is 50%. The risk of fatality is halved at 32mph.\nThe local petition to reduce the speed limit to 30mph is still open at https://www.change.org/p/kings-copse-avenue-to-30mph\nYou know what to do to help make Hedge End's roads safer for all road users."
