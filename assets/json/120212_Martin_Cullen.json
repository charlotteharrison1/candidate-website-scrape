I’ll also host monthly drop-in sessions, providing opportunities for face-to-face discussions about your concerns.\nHowever as we head towards the election, I'd love to hear about what currently matters most to people in Lutterworth and the surrounding villages, so would appreciate you taking the time to fill out the survey below.\nI hope to win your support on 1st May. Together, I believe we can build a brighter future for Lutterworth and ensure the County Council serves residents more effectively.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWelcome to the Official Page for Martin Cullen, The Labour Party candidate for Lutterworth in the 2025 Leicestershire County Council Elections 🌹\nPromoted by David Gair on behalf of Martin Cullen.
