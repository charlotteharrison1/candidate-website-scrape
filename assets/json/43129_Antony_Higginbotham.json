Giving them the powers and resources they need to keep us safe.

Lancashire has secured over 600 so far.

  "https_www_antonyhig_co_uk_/https_www_antonyhig_co_uk_social-media-and-email-policy/content_20.html": "My approach to social media, and communicating with constituents\nI am incredibly proud to be the Member of Parliament for Burnley & Padiham. I represent residents from every corner of our borough including not only the two main towns of Burnley and Padiham, but also our wonderful villages and parishes like Hapton, Worsthorne with Hurstwood, Dunnockshaw & Clowbridge, Cliviger, Briercliffe, Whittlefield, Ightenhill, Rosegrove, Lowerhouse, Gannow, and Habergham Eaves.\nI am keen to hear from, and engage, with as many constituents as possible. I do this through running surveys, holding surgeries - including many ‘pop-up surgeries’ in supermarkets, community centres and more - visiting businesses and charities, and responding to the thousands of emails, letters, phonecalls, casework and policy queries I get every month. Whilst I endeavour to respond to everything as swiftly and personally as possible, unfortunately this is not always possible.\nI also use my official social media channels to promote:\n- What the Government is doing to help constituents and more broadly\n- To highlight the work I am doing as the local MP\n- To showcase the brilliant businesses, charities, organisations and people that make our borough such a special place.\nI have created this webpage so that I am as transparent as possible with everyone about how I manage my social media;, other communications like email, phone and face-to-face; and Casework.\nIt is important to recognise, as those of us in political life do, that as a Member of Parliament I have a particular political viewpoint which I know not everyone will agree with. But I was elected by a majority on a Conservative manifesto. I also know that others will have their own views and opinions. I respect this. Even if I don’t agree with someone’s views, it is their right to have a different viewpoint to mine and what makes a democracy vibrant.\nSocial Media\nMy social media is spread across the main platforms - most notably Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn. The primary platform used is Facebook, as this is where most residents are active, and is a more community based platform.\nMy approach to all social media is designed to ensure that every constituent feels comfortable interacting with me on matters that pertain to me as their Member of Parliament. To that end I ask that contributors are polite and respectful of others, and that comments are relevant to the content of the post.\nThere are, sadly, some who wish to abuse my social media accounts for their own purposes. I do not believe that this is right and I do not do this to others with different views to myself.\nI will also do everything necessary to protect myself, my staff, and others, from abuse, harassment, and other threats.\nMy content is curated, and posted, either by me or my team members. I try to respond to comments on Facebook as much as I can, but will rarely engage with people on Twitter (either from comments or Direct Messages).\nSocial media is not a good platform to raise casework issues, or matters that need an in-depth response or analysis. Comments are not a substitute for emails and I won’t be able to action as a result of them. More often than not, it is better to put your question or comment into an email to me at [email protected].\nThe ground rules that I have set for my social media channels are as follows.\n- The primary aim of my social media accounts is to serve constituents in Burnley & Padiham. If you are identified as not living or working in the constituency, you may have your comments ignored, hidden, or removed.\n- Abuse and threats of any kind will not be tolerated – even if you think that the words that you have used are mild or were posted with tongue in cheek. Any comments that my team and/or I feel are not polite or respectful may be hidden or deleted without prior notice and the account that is posting them may be blocked and reported to the social media companies and the to Police. We have a zero-tolerance policy which means that we will report all threats and abuse.\n- Comments that are designed to cause anger, division, abuse or hate will be deleted. Where an individual posts such comments a number of times they mayl be blocked from that social media platform.\n- While I welcome feedback, the comments sections of my social media channels are not to be used by opposition activists, opposition councillors or organisations to post political views that are not compatible with Government policies. As long as they follow the rules that are set by the social media company, they should be able to create their own page or account. Likewise, comments that are intended to deflect or divert attention from the content of the main post may be removed without prior notice, and persistent offenders of this may be blocked.\n- Spamming is not tolerated. This includes persistent posting of comments across multiple posts or platforms that basically say the same thing or posting an unrelated comment to the original post. These comments will be deleted and the account that is posting them may be blocked without any prior notice.\n- My posts will almost always be on a single topic and will have a single purpose. To make constituents aware of a new Government grant, to tell constituents about a local business, to congratulate a group or a person, etc. Comments that have no relevance to the post may be removed.\n- Advertising of any kind is not permitted and any genuine recommendations of products or services that people make in the comments are the responsibility of the person making the recommendation.\n- Parliamentary processes can be complex and votes that sound simple, may actually have been anything but. However, some people seek to exploit this complexity to say that I have voted for or against something, when the reality is very different. This misrepresenting of my views, and voting record, is unacceptable and always done in order to promote a different political agenda, or a different political party. Those who seek to use my social media platforms to spread such misinformation may have their comment hidden or blocked without prior notice, and may be blocked from the channel.\nOn a typical day I will receive several hundred emails, on some days I have received in excess of 500 emails.\nEvery email received by my office is read, considered and then registered for response. The emails I receive can broadly be categorised into four types;\n- Casework\n- Policy questions,\n- Campaigns\n- Parliamentary and constituency matters.\nCasework\nCasework consists of a wide range of subject matter, which can include extremely urgent cases – evictions, criminal actions, immigration concerns, threats of violence, anti-social behaviour.\nCasework is almost always treated as a priority and in a typical day I will receive 50 or more such emails, but sometimes many more. Each case can take as little as 15 minutes to action, but in the most challenging cases, can take many hours and span many months.\nI work with my team to ensure we deal with these as quickly as possible and we try to ensure everyone has received a personal acknowledgement within 5 days, and a substantive response within 3 weeks. Often, the timelines for a substantive response are driven by third parties I need to engage with, rather than my office.\nPlease also see the larger ‘Casework Policy’ section below.\nPolicy\nPolicy emails largely consist of individuals promoting a policy that they want the Government to pursue, or of individuals and organisations expressing their views around a policy area. These emails can consist of a single sentence advising me of their dislike of a particular policy, they can consist of a reasoned and personal consideration of why a policy might need review, or can consist of many pages of challenging opinion on a range of issues.\nIn a typical day, I will receive around 50 such emails, and on occasion - where particularly issues are in the news - several hundred. There are also a number of constituents who routinely send me policy emails, sometimes I will receive 3 or more from the same person in a week.\nResponses to policy emails take a lower priority than casework, and when a number of very similar policy emails are received these may be responded to by a templated response. However, that template will always be written by me, or written by a member of my team and then reviewed by me. I aim to respond to all policy emails within a month, but during busy periods this will become longer as resources get dedicated to casework and constituent issues.\nCampaigns\nCampaign emails consist of more than one person writing on the same subject to ask that a particular position, or policy is supported. For example, an organisation wants the Government to do more to support local pubs, or wants the Government to stop E-Scooter trials.\nThere are almost always coordinated by pressure / campaign groups, and require little thought by an individual who usually clicks a button that says “Email Your MP”. I then receive the text. It is easy to spot these as I receive identical wording each time.\nI typically receive around 100 of these emails a day, and on occasion have received several hundred in a day. Responses to campaign emails take a lower priority than casework and policy, and as most campaigns consist of multiple identical, or broadly similar, emails, these will often be responded to with a templated response. As with policy emails, every template will either be written by me, or written by a member of my team and then reviewed by me. I aim to respond to campaign emails within 6 weeks, but during busy periods this will become longer as resources get dedicated to casework and constituent issues.\nParliamentary and constituency matters\nMy office will also receive emails that deal with my day-to-day parliamentary and constituency work. This might include information about a particular bill, responses from Ministers to queries I have raised, requests for meetings, information from charities, policy groups and APPGs, requests for me to visit a local business or organisation, and a wide range of other communications that my staff and I attend to throughout the day.\nI typically receive around 150 of this type of correspondence a day and each would be assigned a priority depending on its nature.\nDealing with casework & surgeries\nMembers of Parliament are elected to the House of Commons to represent the interests and concerns of all the people who live in their constituency, whether they voted for them or not. This involves a large amount of casework. It is up to the individual MP if they choose to take on a particular case or not. There is no legal requirement to do so. However, I take the approach that I will respond to every constituent for casework and will do my best to solve the issues that they have.\nThe exception to this is individuals who have been abusive, threatening, or bullying. This behaviour can have occured in person, on-line, by email, or over the phone. In these instances I take the view that I will not engage but will ensure I provide information on other sources of support - such as the Citizens Advice.\nI also hold regular surgery appointments in person, via telephone and online. Whilst most of these are on a more informal ‘drop-in’ basis in places like supermarkets, I do also run appointment only surgeries for those who have private issues to raise with me. Surgeries are intended to provide an opportunity to raise matters or views with me, or to discuss the outline of your problem and to determine if I can help in any way.\nIf you do need a private appointment, the best way to book is to email [email protected]. You will need to provide your full name, full postal address which includes door number, street name, city, and postcode, and a preferred telephone number and email address. This is due to a strict parliamentary protocol which means that I can only make representations on behalf of constituents and businesses that are within the area that he has been elected to represent.\nIf you are contacting me on behalf of another constituent, you will need to make this clear and usually return a form of authority. My team can send a copy of this form to you if you call my office.\nMPs are not able to intervene in any legal proceedings or contract-related issues, such as private disputes with neighbours or employers, nor help to settle family arguments. Me and my team can signpost individuals to specific support agencies, such as Citizens Advice, Welfare Rights Service, and the national Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service which helps to resolve in-work disputes.",

And I’m grateful for the support and partnership of the Government and Police and Crime Commissioner Andrew Snowden in securing this vital funding. By working together, we can make a real difference in the lives of survivors and prevent further harm.\nThe Drive Project, has already demonstrated remarkable success in other parts of the country and will be delivered in close partnership with Victim Support and other local services. By pooling resources and expertise, the initiative aims to achieve long-term behaviour change and significantly reduce incidents of domestic abuse across Lancashire.\nIndependent evaluations conducted by the University of Bristol have shown outstanding outcomes from the Drive Project elsewhere. Service users experienced an 82% reduction in physical abuse, an 88% reduction in sexual abuse, a 75% reduction in harassment and stalking behaviours, and a 73% reduction in jealous and controlling behaviours.\nLancashire’s Police and Crime Commissioner Andrew Snowden said:\nTackling domestic abuse is a priority for me and the additional funding, secured from the Home Office, will make a real impact here in Lancashire.\nThe Drive Project focuses on breaking the cycle of abuse by working with the most high-risk, serial perpetrators of domestic abuse with the aim of stopping them from causing harm to those closest to them.\nWhilst I want to see perpetrators punished for their actions, it is equally important to address their behaviour so that it isn’t repeated and further harm inflicted on current or future partners.",

  "https_www_antonyhig_co_uk_/https_www_antonyhig_co_uk_news_faster-treatment-more-choice/content_11.html": "Last week I welcomed the Minister for Health to Blackburn Hospital. I did so as a big part of my role is making sure that Government really understands the issues faced by residents in Burnley and Padiham. Because for all the good that Blackburn provides, I am fully aware of the challenges and have been doing what I can to secure the changes we need to see improvements in patient care.\nMuch of it centres around capacity issues, with demand having dramatically increased in recent years. But it’s also about making sure that we direct people to the right place to utilise all of our healthcare settings. From the launch of Pharmacy First, or the further investment we’ve seen at Burnley General Hospital, positive steps are being taken. Not only will increasing the use of Burnley alleviate a lot of the issues being faced at Blackburn Royal, but it will also provide a quicker and more convenient choice for those needing care within our own community.\nIt’s in this vein that I welcomed this week’s announcement which focused on giving patients more choice when accessing routine treatments within the NHS. From hearing aid care to mental health treatment and diagnostic tests such as endoscopy - where we’ve already seen recent investment at Burnley General Hospital - patients will soon have more choices when accessing NHS care.\nPutting patients firmly in the driver's seat of their own healthcare is a positive step. Combined with speedier diagnosis and treatment, it’s exactly the approach I’ve been advocating for when meeting with Government Ministers and NHS leaders.\nOf course, no initiative comes without its challenges. Addressing barriers to patient choice, such as access to information and support for transport costs, will be crucial in ensuring that choice is meaningful for all patients. Momentum is building though with the NHS gearing up to launch pilots in local areas from the autumn, engaging with integrated care boards (ICBs) to ensure widespread participation. I too will be feeding in the views I hear on the doorstep week in, week out.\nThese changes are part of a broader strategy to tackle waiting lists and improve access to healthcare services. With waiting lists already falling by almost 200,000 since September, the NHS is on the right track. And we mustn’t let up.\nThe benefits of all of this? Shorter waiting times, better outcomes, and greater convenience for us all. Empowering patients to take control of their healthcare decisions is essential for a faster, simpler, and fairer NHS.",

Derived from seized criminal assets, these ill-gotten gains are now been put to good use to bolster community safety efforts across the county, including in Burnley and Padiham.\nCommenting on the latest round of investment by the PCC, Antony Higginbotham MP said:\nThere’s some justice in seizing the proceeds of crime and then using that money to put something back into the community. It’s a brilliant idea by our Police and Crime Commissioner Andrew Snowden and it has my full support.\nEarlier this year I sent out information packs to all of our Parish Councils encouraging them to bid for funding for initiatives which would combat crime and anti-social behaviour. That could be for equipment, infrastructure, community engagement, pilot projects and other ideas and schemes that ultimately make people safer.\nOrganisations such as Rosegrove Neighbourhood Watch and the Burnley Boys and Girls Club have already received funding and I’ll continue to work with other local groups who may have ideas to tackle ASB too. Teamwork is key.\nThe Safer Lancashire Neighbourhoods Fund has allocated funds to eight new projects, spanning various regions within Lancashire. This initiative, which reopened for applications in Spring 2023 and includes both the Community Fund strand and the Police Innovation Fund.\nThe supported projects will address various aspects of community safety, including the installation of CCTV systems, improved lighting in key areas, the establishment of shop and pub watch schemes, support for street pastors, and initiatives targeting antisocial behaviour and victim prevention.\nSince its inception in March 2022, the Safer Lancashire Neighbourhoods Fund has played a pivotal role in reducing crime and antisocial behaviour across the county, supporting 31 projects through its Community strand and investing over £700,000 in local initiatives.\nAndrew Snowden, Police and Crime Commissioner said:\nThe first twelve months of my Safer Lancashire Neighbourhoods Fund saw cash, seized from criminals, being invested into strong, community focused projects that help deliver my Fighting Crime Plan and make everyone, across the county, safer.\nWith local groups delivering projects that target concerns in neighbourhoods, and investment towards innovative policing that keep us one step ahead of criminals, we're making a positive difference whilst hitting offenders where it hurts, their pockets.\nWe have seen how important it is to support local people and neighbourhoods to reduce the risk of crime, prevent victims and the role projects can have when breaking cycles of reoffending.\nAs I continue to lead the fight against crime, I will work closely with the Constabulary and partners across Lancashire so that any investment we make delivers value for money and, crucially, positive results that make a lasting difference.",

Airbus, which manufactures almost all its aircraft wings in the UK bringing in jobs and investment to the UK economy – is developing more efficient wing designs and increasing carbon fibre production rates for wing components, reducing CO2 emissions and fuel burn.\nFunding for these projects will be delivered through the Aerospace Technology Institute (ATI) programme. It was also confirmed today that the £975 million in aerospace funding over five years from 2025, announced at Autumn Statement, will be allocated to the ATI programme. The programme has facilitated over £3.6 billion of joint government and industry R&D investment to date - providing industry with continued confidence and security to invest in the UK for the long term - and includes R&D support for small businesses through the ATI SME competition.\nAlongside this, the Chancellor has today set out further details of the two-year £50 million apprenticeship growth sector pilot announced at Autumn Statement.\nFollowing engagement with the sector, from April eligible apprenticeship providers of apprenticeship standards including pipe welder, nuclear technician and laboratory technician will now benefit from targeted payments worth £3k for every start of an apprentice.\nIt is intended the funding will be used to support providers in making capital investment that will unlock their ability to grow and deliver the standards in scope of the pilot, such as purchasing course specific equipment, tools, and machinery that will last beyond delivery of a single apprenticeship.\nThis will explore ways to stimulate training and break down barriers to high-quality training in advanced manufacturing and engineering, green industries, and life sciences apprenticeships. Further detail will be set out in upcoming guidance later this month.\nThe significant funding package for R&D and manufacturing projects announced today is targeted to support sectors where the UK is or could be world-leading and is designed to unlock investment from the private sector by providing certainty to investors - supporting the government’s priority to grow our economy by protecting existing and creating new jobs, so we can deliver the long-term change our country needs to deliver a brighter future.\nChancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt said:\n“We’re sticking with our plan by backing the industries of the future with millions of pounds of investment to make the UK a world leader in manufacturing, securing the highly-skilled jobs of the future and delivering the long-term change our country needs to deliver a brighter future for Britain”.\nBusiness and Trade Secretary Kemi Badenoch said:\n“Today’s announcement builds on the success of our Advanced Manufacturing plan announced last year, and will ensure we continue to grow the economy, help create jobs and secure the future of great British manufacturing.\nOur plan for the British economy is working – which is why firms like Airbus and BMW are continuing to bet on Britain.”\nA full breakdown of the auto and aero winning projects is included below:\n9 Aerospace Technology Institute Programme projects led by:\n- Safran Landing Systems: Developing new designs, methodologies, and technologies to accelerate and catalyse benefits for current and next generation landing gears.\n- Marshall Group: Developing and testing a smart, connected liquid hydrogen (LH2) fuel system for the next generation of zero emission aircraft.\n- Airbus and National Composites Centre: Developing technology which increases the production rate of carbon fibre upper covers for aircraft wings.\n- Airbus: Developing ultra-efficient technologies to cut fuel burn and weight, independent of the fuel choice.\n- Airbus: Developing wing design and manufacturing technologies for lighter, more efficient aircraft.\n- Spirit AeroSystems: Developing technologies for the storage and integration of liquid hydrogen on large aircraft.\n- Goodrich: Developing a power-dense electric propulsion motor drive system aimed at hybrid and electric aircraft including helicopters and potentially next generation single aisle planes.\n- TT Electronics: Developing technology to support electrical power conversion and electric machines for future more electric and all electric aircraft operating at higher voltages.\n- Phoenix Scientific Industries: Transforming the production of titanium powder via ‘cold-crucible’ gas atomisation to enable high volume production.",

Not just for the community but the young people they’re exploiting too.\nNow Lancashire Police are making really good inroads with an enhanced road policing unit and with Neighbourhood taskforces. But could the Secretary of State set out what more the Lancashire Constabulary can do to tackle county lines and bring order back to our streets.\nResponding Home Secretary James Cleverley said:\nI thank my honourable friend for highlighting this vile type of criminality targeting the young and the most vulnerable. As part of our fight against county lines we’re investing up to £145 million in our county lines programme.\nSince the county lines programme was launched in 2019, police activity has resulted in over 4,700 county lines being closed – over 14,800 arrests – and over 7,200 safeguard referrals.\nWe will keep our focus on this evil criminality.\nSpeaking afterwards Burnley’s MP said:\nHaving joined the police on more than one operation, I’m unequivocal in my support for the tough approach they’re taking to dismantle county line drug gangs.\nNot only are these gangs peddling drugs within Burnley and Padiham, which we know causes so much crime and anti-social behaviour but they’re using children in their criminality which is just vile.\nI’ve never shied away from saying that drugs ruin lives. And I’ll do everything within my power to stamp them out.",

Combined with the cut at the Autumn Statement, this will put another £900 back in the pockets of the average earner. And delivers the lowest effective personal tax rate since 1975!\nCommenting, Burnley and Padiham’s MP Antony Higginbotham said:\nBecause we stuck to the plan, inflation has more than halved, the economy has performed better than forecast, wages are rising, mortgage rates are starting to come down, the economy has outperformed our European neighbours and debt is on track to fall as a share of the economy.\nAnd this Budget is a result of the tough decisions taken by the Government to put us on a firm path to growth. It’s why we’re now in a position to cut taxes further, as I have wanted to do since the day I got elected.\nLet’s be under no illusion, putting money back into people’s pockets not only wouldn’t be possible under Labour, due to their reckless spending plans, but it wouldn’t even be on their agenda.\nCutting National Insurance is the fairest and most effective way to incentivise work and drive growth, whilst also reducing the overall tax burden.\nThe plan is also seeing National Insurance cut for the self-employed, delivering a combined tax cut worth on average £650.\nThanks to these latest tax cuts, and to above-inflation increases to tax thresholds since 2010, an average worker in 2024-25 will pay over £1,600 less in personal taxes than they otherwise would have done.\nCommenting, Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt MP said:\nBecause the Conservatives are sticking to the plan with the economy inflation is down from 11.1 per cent to 4.0 per cent, meaning we can cut taxes and put more money in people’s pockets to grow the economy.\nOur Budget cuts taxes to reward work, supports small businesses and helps more parents with the cost of childcare to grow the economy and fund public services.\nBy sticking to the plan, the Conservatives will deliver a stronger economy to build a brighter future. Labour cannot say what they would do with the economy because they do not have a plan and would take us back to square one.",
