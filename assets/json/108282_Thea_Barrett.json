But the huge majority of 83% in favour of legal action against polluting water companies shows the power of public feeling.\nMore than 8 in 10 Britons support the setting of legally binding targets to reduce the amount of sewage spilled into waterways according to the latest Ipsos poll for the Financial Times.\nMore and more people are realising the scale of the of the sewage scandal, of how the privatised water companies looted the water industry, sinking the water companies under huge debts, paying out vast dividends while allowing vital infrastructure to collapse. In 2023 there were 464,056 sewage spills , according to the Environment Agency, a 54% increase on the previous year.\nSince the industry was privatised in thre Tory fire sale of public assets more than 30 years ago investors have withdrawn £85.2bn from 10 water and sewage firms in England and Wales, analysis by the University of Greenwich suggests. That is £85.2 that has gone into investors ‘pockets’ rather being invested in the water industry we all depend on.\nPublic services owned by the public for the public\nThe Green Party is the only party to pledge to return the water industry to public ownership. as Green Party candidate Steve Roberts put it, “Privatisation has failed. Dividends are paid to shareholders while infrastructure is run into the ground, we all know how privatisation of the water companies worked out. The Green Party is committed to the public ownership of public services, so they are run to serve us all, rather than to increase the wealth of shareholders.”",

She has been Green Councillor for Central Harbour ward on Thanet District Council and Ramsgate Town Council for two years, and chairs Addington Street Community Group which runs the popular Revival Fair. Becky works with vulnerable young people for Charlton Athletic FC’s community arm. At TDC she has worked to protect Ramsgate’s port, harbour and beaches and regenerate its town centre. She has also pushed TDC for more openness and community involvement across all its activities.\nKatie lives in Newington and has a daughter at Royal Harbour Academy and a son at a local primary school. She has worked in housing, regeneration and recruitment, and wants to see improvements for residents’ lives now, particularly in the wake of the pandemic which has created so much extra pressure on families. She wants to ensure Newington and Ramsgate are seen and heard, and that both KCC and TDC allocate funding and support wards that feel overlooked & neglected.\nKatie is also the Green Party’s candidate for the TDC Newington by-election.\nBroadstairs\nMike Garner is standing for the Green Party in Broadstairs.\nMike is the Leader of the Green Group on Thanet District Council. He is the newly-elected Chair of the Governance and Audit Committee and sits on the Planning Committee and Climate Emergency Working Group. Mike represents St Peters on TDC and Broadstairs Town Council. He has worked with residents’ groups to create new play areas and protect green spaces, and with the Tree Warden to encourage new planting and build biodiversity across the Isle. Mike will fight against encroachment into the green wedge and support residents to secure high quality KCC services.\nMargate\nOur candidate in Margate is central Margate resident Sue Rees.\nSue is retired and volunteers with Pilgrims Hospice. She believes that as a seaside resort in a fishing area, Margate must act on the plastic and other waste going into our oceans. This directly impacts on the life of the town, affecting tourism and jobs as well as the quality of residents’ lives. As a flat-dweller without access to recycling facilities, she has campaigned for improvements to local waste and recycling services, which she argues need a complete overhaul.\nCliftonville\nThe Green Party candidate in Cliftonville is local activist Michelle Thomas.\nMichelle is a local single parent and communications specialist working mainly in the entertainment industry. She is an active campaigner with XR and other social and environmental groups and has advised Thanet District Council on statues and plaques in view of Black Lives Matter. A non-driver herself, she wants to see the area become more pedestrian- and cyclist-friendly, with access to good, affordable public transport, and believes post-Covid we must rebuild around people, not cars.\nBirchington and Rural\nIn Birchington and Rural, the Green Party’s candidates are Rob Edwards and Abi Smith.\nRob is 28 and has lived in Westgate for most of his life, working at the Carlton Cinema, delivering papers, planting trees and helping with community campaigns. As a younger person with friends and older relatives in the area, he will work hard to ensure all generations’ needs are catered for. Rob works in the sports sector and wants to see KCC approach public health positively via better-managed open spaces, cycling &walking facilities and an emphasis on family-friendly activities.\nAbi lives in Westgate and is familiar locally from her work in Thanet libraries and Kent Community Health, and more widely from her volunteer work, including several years with Thanet Citizens’ Advice, which gave her an insight into the resilience of people in the area and the daily challenges they face. She believes vested interests are threatening the wellbeing of local communities. She will be a voice to stand up for the people and environment of Birchington and the villages within KCC.",

Oversight has been almost non-existent.”\n“All that needs to happen is the regulatory framework that we have is used to hold water companies to account. We need government to act.”\nL-R Green councillor Mike Garner,Fergal Sharkey, Dame Jennie Jones, Green councillor Tricia Austin\n“The Water Companies Are Being Let Off”\nJennie Jones added, “The water companies are being let off, they should not be giving hand-outs to senior staff and shareholders until there are improvements to infrastructure and those discharges are brought right down to a tiny level or stopped entirely.”\n“The water companies call them storm outfalls but they are simply discharges at any time of the day or night.\n“We have to make sure they are fined properly and that they have to be part of the clean ups.\n“It is Green Party policy that that we should renationalise something so precious so it will not be in the hands of people making a profit.”\nBoth speakers said people across the country were now making their anger known and telling government, water companies and regulators that they would not stand for the pollution any longer.\nBut in January MPs, including South Thanet’s Tory MP Craig Mackinlay, voted in favour of The Draft Environmental Targets Regulations which sets legally binding targets to tackle water pollution but it does not take effect for 15 years! So for the water companies it will be dirty business as usual if they are not stopped so now is the time for action!\nThanet Green councillor Tricia Austin and Dame Jennie JonesGreen Party leader Mike Garner said: “It was great to see so many people there.

I will be campaigning to make sure spending is both protected and increased.\nRoad Safety – As the number of serious accidents on the streets of Broadstairs increases, improving road safety is also a high priority for me.\nSarah Thorne Theatre – Another key issue for me is to stop KCC’s plans to sell the only theatre in Broadstairs, the Sarah Thorne.

Every effort for example, must be made to keep the Pie Factory Youth Centre open and ensure GP provision increases.\nRoad Safety – Making our roads safer, especially for pedestrians. Expanding 20mph zones, increasing safe crossing places and slowing traffic around schools and ‘accident hotspots’ is essential given our high crash data.\nRecycling, waste and rubbish – Improving access to waste and recycling for those without transport as well as the removal of rubbish along our highways.\nEconomic Growth – Greater focus on small, medium size businesses and our town centres as they face great change, while increasing opportunities for our young to benefit from employment, further education or training.\nEnvironment – Seek ways to enhance our open spaces, verges and streets as well as seek and implement alternatives to the use of weedkiller containing glyphosate in our communities.\nIf you would like further information or to discuss any issue, then please contact me via: greenbeckywing@gmail.com or via messenger.",

Over 30 protesters took to the sea on surfboards, paddle-boards and bodyboards, accompanied by swimmers and supported by protestors on land with placards and music, to highlight their concerns about the pollution of our seas.\n©Steve RobertsNational Day of Paddle out protests\nThe event was part of a day of Big Paddle Out demonstrations across the country called by national protest group Surfers Against Sewage (SAS) to highlight the continuing irresponsible behaviour of water companies all over the UK, after the annual data release on sewage discharges showed sewage was released for 2.4 million hours across the UK last year. In Thanet, repeated sewage spills into our seas have rendered our beaches inaccessible, while water outages lasting up to several days have affected some areas.\nSouthern Water’s woeful record\nBefore the protest, a Surfers Against Sewage spokesperson highlighted Southern Water’s woeful record – an environmental performance rating of just 1 out of 4, and 80 ‘dry spills’ (sewage releases after no rainfall for 2 or more days) in the past year – the highest number of any water company. Yet water companies continue to pay their executives millions of pounds, including substantial bonuses, and most continue to pay out dividends to shareholders. SAS is asking for an end to shareholder payouts until water companies comply fully with environmental regulations, a cap to company bosses’ bonuses and transparency on where money paid to water companies is going.\n©Tricia AustinTake Action – Join The Green campaign to save our seas\nIf you want to join the campaign to stop the water companies polluting our seas for profit and to fight for clean seas and beaches then click HERE and go to our ‘what to do about Southern Water’ post to find out how to take action.",

They will reward the richest while cracking down on benefit claims and the most vulnerable people in society. And they will once again postpone the radical policies needed to tackle climate change.\nTax cut bribes\nGreen co-leader Carla Denyer condemned the announcement:\n“The government has chosen headline-grabbing pre-election tax cut bribes over doing their job properly – providing good public services and protecting citizens from harm caused by the cost-of-living crisis and the climate crisis.\n“Indeed, this was a particularly cruel statement for the long-term sick and some disabled people who will now be forced into work or lose their benefits.\n“People won’t be fooled by a few extra quid in their pay packet when they can’t get a dentist, the wait to see the GP is getting ever longer, and the impacts of the climate crisis are becoming ever more obvious and close to home.\n“The government is fishing for a day’s worth of General Election friendly headlines at high long-term costs to public services, people’s quality of life and the environment”\nThe Green Party’s 10 point plan\nThe Green Party has a 10-point plan of distinctive tax and spend policies to create a fairer, greener country:\n- Restoring the public health budget by increasing spending by £1.4 billion\n- Immediately increasing NHS spending by £8 billion, to ensure NHS staff can be paid an inflation matching pay award\n- Meeting the Government’s current plan to increase access to NHS dentists by increasing spending 50 per cent – £1.5 billion – of the total NHS dentistry budget\n- Ending the rise in homelessness caused by the cap on Local Housing Allowances at a cost of £700 million\n- Increasing Universal Credit by £40 per week at a cost of £9bn\n- Abolishing the two-child benefit cap to reduce poverty for some of the most vulnerable children in the country by increasing the welfare budget by £1.3 billion\n- Providing the necessary powers and funding to rural local authorities to take back control of bus services so they can increase routes and service frequencies at a cost of £3bn\n- Turning ISAs green by linking their tax exemptions to investments in green bonds\n- Investing an additional £3billion in Green Transition Grants for small businesses to help them prepare for and take advantage of the opportunities offered by greening the economy\n- Rebalancing the tax system to raise an extra £30 billion through changes to Capital Gains Tax, National Insurance and the abolition of “non dom status” which would pay for the proposed measures\nThe needs of people and the planet\nCarla continued, “The country cannot afford pre-election tax cut bribes from this failed Tory government. They mean postponing, yet again, the action we need to tackle the climate crisis – action that would create new, secure, well-paid green jobs.\n“Living in a decent society means investing in public services that meet the needs of people and planet. We can afford better public services. We can protect the environment and the most vulnerable in society, keep people warm and lift people out of poverty.\n“With more Green MPs in Parliament after the next General Election, we would rebalance the tax system so that the super-rich pay their fair share and use the money to mend the NHS, invest in preventative public health services, support those in greatest need, and boost the transition to a greener economy and all the benefits that will bring.”..and one more thing Jeremy. About inflation…\nMeanwhile the chancellor Jeremy Hunt, the tireless warrior against inflation that he is, has been doing his personal bit to make it worse.\nThe fine folk at Led By Donkeys have discovered that Mr Hunt owns some flats in Southampton and part of his anti inflation strategy has been to put the rent up by 18%!

The Tories’ Minimum Service Levels legislation will mean that when workers lawfully vote to strike, they could be forced to attend work – and sacked if they don’t comply.\nThis year, I have stood on dozens of picket lines with thousands of workers. With physios, paramedics, rail workers, university lecturers, civil servants, teachers and more.\nToday, special Congress resolved that we will continue to fight for their right to strike. And for the right of every worker to strike. We will defy this government and we will get this unjust law repealed. Our movement made clear today that if they come for one worker, they will face us all.”\nWorkers are winning\nHe continued, “In the last two years we have seen union members take action in workplaces up and down the country, many for the first time. And crucially, workers are winning, through their unions.”\n“Our campaign will continue in our workplaces and communities – and today we announced our next national action. So on 27 January, the whole movement will march with the sacked GCHQ workers through Cheltenham, to commemorate their victory and to recommit ourselves to defiant opposition to minimum service levels, trade union restrictions and any threat to the right to strike.\nJoin the march and rally in Cheltenham to make our voices heard.”\nThanet Green Party councillor Tricia Austin\nThanet Green Party councillor Tricia Austin responded to Nowak’s call to arms on social media.\n“Thanks for this, Paul.\nI’m afraid I’m unable to join the march but strongly support its aims. Having worked extensively with the TUC and affiliate unions in the past, I know how much difference union membership makes.\nAs a Green Party Councillor, I’ve been proud to stand on picket lines with RMT, ASLEF and CWU colleagues in our area. And I was very proud of our former Party Leader Baroness Natalie Bennett for raising her Fatal Motion in the Lords last week to try to derail this wicked piece of legislation.\nBut where were Labour colleagues on the picket lines – and where were the Labour Lords supporting Natalie? In both cases, their leadership had told them not to back workers struggling for their rights.\nHow can the TUC and Unions continue to support a neoliberal Labour Party? It no longer believes in Clause 4 – and as far as I can see it no longer sees itself as the workers’ party either. So what exactly is the point of it?\nI’m a socialist, so I joined the Green Party – it’s the only logical choice these days.\nGood luck with your continuing good work,\nTricia”\nJoin today\nPaul Nowak’s final message is that’ “We must continue the fight for fairness and a voice in every workplace. But we can’t win without getting more people into unions.\nIf you’re not a union member, you can join today.\nIf friends or family haven’t joined yet, today’s the day to ask them.\nJoin the march and rally in Cheltenham to make our voices heard.\nProtect the Right to Strike: National march and rally in Cheltenham\nSaturday, January 27, 2024 • 12:00pm\nMontpellier Gardens, Cheltenham",

We really appreciate how considerate people have been in taking moderate amounts so as many people as possible can share the produce. We have had some great feedback and some people have talked enthusiastically about the varying food dishes they have been making!”\nDistrict Councillor and horticulturalist Kevin Pressland believes that if we could expand this idea throughout Thanet, it would have a multitude of positive benefits. Kevin explains: “The ‘National Food Strategy’ produced for the Government by Henry Dimbleby in 2020-21 was the first independent extensive review of the entire food system for 75 years. It was great that the Government asked for this report, but it highlighted many shortfalls in the current and previous Governments’ approach.\nThe Government responded by promising to implement 3 things, one being ‘Use some revenue to help get fresh fruit and vegetables to low-income families’. I only wished they had honoured that commitment and taken the National Food Strategy’s recommendations more seriously. But if we can use small pieces of land like this one for food growing across Thanet, it will help make this a reality.”\nCentral Harbour Green Councillor Tricia Austin said: ‘This initiative is very welcome and it’s great to see it going so well. We’re delighted with all the improvements that volunteers have achieved in Ellington Park – as recognised by their recent Ramsgate Society ‘Winner of Winners’ award!\n“It’s been particularly good to watch the development of the wildflower meadow, which contributes to biodiversity, as do other wildlife habitats like the pond. The food-growing initiative is a really positive development that I’m sure can be replicated elsewhere in Ramsgate. Well done to everyone involved.”\nAnother volunteer, Petra Dungate, added: “I harvested chard and rhubarb this summer. Fresh veg and fruit is the best and I am so delighted it is not sprayed. Absolutely delicious and nutritious, we need more projects like this. I made sure I took only enough for 1 meal each time. I look forward to harvesting fruit once the soft fruit grow more next year.”\nThis article also appeared in The Isle of Thanet News.",

In a national table of Local Authorities, we’re well into the bottom half – though in fairness many do far worse. A ‘perfect storm’ of factors make recycling a real challenge on the Isle, including:\n- many blocks of flats and HMOs with extremely limited storage for waste & recycling\n- some landlords who don’t provide either facilities or information\n- a high turnover of tenants in some areas, and lots of AirBNBs with short-stay visitors\n- high coastal winds that knock over recycling bins and spread the contents of boxes\n- almost no public recycling facilities, many withdrawn as a result of ‘misuse’\n- a Local Authority structure where TDC bears the brunt (in dealing with fly-tipped waste) of KCC’s decision to start charging for large loads at household waste sites.\nThe recent, apparently temporary, closure of public recycling facilities in Sainsburys’ at Westwood Cross has led to an outcry on local social media groups, highlighting just how many people with no household recycling collections were in the regular habit of taking a trip over to Westwood in private cars to drop their recyclables into the public bins. As an area that’s declared a Climate Emergency, surely we must reflect on how sustainable this arrangement is?\nAre we a hopeless case, or can something be done? As Chair of Ramsgate Litter & Recycling Forum and a Green Party member, I have to believe we can improve! But it will take political will, at all levels of local government.\nI know TDC’s Cabinet Member for Operational Services is reviewing waste services at present, so I have 5 recommendations for him to consider on Global Recycling Day:\n- Build a much closer relationship with KCC on household waste & recycling. Specifically:\n- help KCC establish reuse facilities at its waste sites, so useable items can go to local charities and good causes rather than being recycled or incinerated. Many other authorities do this; it doesn’t take a lot of space or staff time, and it can start to change people’s thinking about sustainability and product lifecycles.\n- get involved in local reuse initiatives too – Margate has a ‘Library of Things’ for swapping unwanted items, for example, and there are local Freecycle & Freegle groups which would welcome Local Authority help & support.\n- agree on ways to disincentivise fly tipping. There’s a wide choice of strategies, from removing KCC charges through better information to CCTV and increased fines – but there are more proactive ones too. One local housing association runs ‘skip days’, for example, when householders can get rid of unwanted large items – but alongside this there’s a swapshop for things like children’s outgrown clothes, and experts on hand to help with furniture upcycling.\n- Conduct a complete review of recycling facilities in Thanet. Look at which properties have no kerbside recycling and why, and think creatively about shared facilities, smaller collection vehicles, lidded boxes so the contents don’t blow down the street (yes, slower to empty, but think of the saving on street cleansing!) Look at where local public recycling bins could be sited, in places that are secure and can be monitored, using attractive modern bins that make recycling more appealing and misuse more difficult. Think ‘why would we NOT make recycling available?’ rather than ‘why do it?’ Establish a clear strategy for increasing recycling rates, with challenging but achievable targets.\n- Thoroughly investigate ‘reverse vending’ machines and consider providing them across the Isle, either working with retailers like Iceland that have trialled this in other areas, or perhaps as a joint Authorities’ initiative with KCC. Something that incentivises people, particularly youngsters, to pick up cans & bottles and recycle them has got to be a win-win (though in time of pandemic it’d clearly need some extra safety checks.)\n- Never, ever again approve planning permission for any new build or conversion that does not have ample facilities for waste and recycling. Ensure that staff tasked with working with ‘rogue landlords’ help those landlords advise tenants how to manage their waste, as it’s often these same tenants who are filling our street bins with domestic rubbish and recyclables simply because they don’t know what else to do with them.\n- Finally (and I’d say this to every portfolio holder in every Council in the land about every area of Local Authority activity), talk with your communities and listen to what they have to say about what works and what doesn’t in their local area. What works in Cliftonville might be disastrous in Ramsgate or vice versa, and Authorities don’t need a ‘one size fits all’ approach. Residents are entitled to parity of service, but that does not necessarily mean exactly the same service in all circumstances. Local ward Councillors should be the eyes & ears of the Council here, acting as a conduit of information in both directions between Council and communities to agree what works best locally.\nLast but not least, I’d like to give a big shout out on Global Recycling Day to every individual who does their best to recycle their waste, and every Local Authority officer who works hard to help them do so. We can improve things if we carry on working together.",

His understanding of the threats faced by the natural world is based on expertise gained from a 40 year career in horticulture, garden design and sustainable land management.\nHere he highlights the crisis in our insect populations and the danger this poses for human life.\nwe need insects\nWe are facing a crisis in our insect populations. Recent figures show a 69% reduction in insect numbers in the last 10 years in Kent and loss of insect numbers for decades previously. The average loss of insect populations in the last 10 years in English counties is 59%.\nWe ignore the plight of insects at our peril. Our welfare depends on insects for pollination, to feed birds and other small animals, and for soil and water health.\nAlmost 75% of our crops/produce are reliant in one way or another from the work of insects in the UK. Important species here are bees (wild solitary bees and bumblebees, as well as domesticated honeybees), flies (including hoverflies and bee-flies), butterflies, moths, wasps, and beetles.\nThe food chain\nIn turn, these creatures feed a plethora of species of birds, amphibians, and freshwater aquatic life. They are also intrinsic to healthy soils – whether it be carotid beetles that predate on slugs or insect associates like nematodes who also help control slug populations.\nThere is strong evidence that the decline in insect numbers has been happening since the push towards intensive farming, including the use of cocktails of chemicals such as herbicides, pesticides and fungicides. This has been exacerbated by major changes in land management, loss of hedgerows, wildlife corridors (fundamental to insects, birds and mammals) and reduction in arable field stubble. Insects are often adversely affected by the constant onslaught on our remaining semi natural and ancient woodlands, with authorities often giving the impression that these can easily be replaced by just growing a few more trees.\nWhat can we do\nWildlife corridors are vital. They are needed through towns, through the countryside and through new developments, to connect remaining fragmented habitats. When we are building many more properties, we also need to be creating green corridors through these developments that both improve people’s quality of life and create those important wildlife corridors.\nFarming is changing\nSubsidies for farming are changing. The old ‘Basic Income Scheme’ effectively gave money for how many hectares you had (nothing for those below 5 hectares of land), generally without any specific obligations on the use of this money unless you agreed to be in additional schemes such as Countryside Stewardship. But a transition is happening.\nNow farmers will only get subsidies based on public good criteria, including better soil management, creating habitats such as hedgerows and tree planting (agroforestry), wildflower meadows, repairing enhancing river and wetland landscapes, under the Environmental Land Management Scheme. There is a large range of options that farmers can choose – but there are no obligations to take these on.\nThe Regenerative Agriculture Conference in June this year was even bigger with over 6000 attendees’, many farmers who are searching for systems that minimise inputs, create more cyclical farming systems https://groundswellag.com/\nAt a local level\nAt local level, we can all manage our gardens in ways that support insects and other wildlife – see for example www.rhs.org.uk/protectingwildlife\nFor more information on sustainable farming practices see https://agricology.co.uk/ and for agroforestry see https://regenerativefoodandfarming.co.uk/agroforestry/ https://www.soilassociation.org",

To make up for being a little later, Thanet’s Big Green Week is in fact 10 days long, running between Friday 1 and Sunday 10 October.\nOur Green Week is a last-minute, cross-party, cross-community initiative that aims to bring together environmentally focused events and activities taking place across Thanet, to encourage and empower residents to take direct action to improve our local – and collectively, our global – environment.\nThe message is unambiguous: we all can and must make positive change to improve our environment and each take responsibility for the change we want to see.\nThe week focuses on sustainable living across the Isle, from litter picks and gardening through webinars and talks to Broadstairs Food Festival. All the events, run by many different groups, are featured on the Green Week Facebook page.\nAlongside the events is a series of links to hints and tips on how we can all live a little more sustainably, ranging from ways to reduce your energy costs (highly topical at present!) to how to green up your front garden. Anyone is welcome to add events or links to the page or to share it with other groups.\nThanet’s Week was the brainchild of Barry Manners from the Friends of Botany Bay and Kingsgate group, who has worked with Thanet Green Party’s Tricia Austin to put the information together. Barry proposed a weekend of beach cleans round the Isle to prepare our beaches for winter, now that extra TDC beach-cleaning staff have finished their seasonal work. So the weekend of 9-10 October will be a weekend of clean-ups in Thanet – Margate and Broadstairs on Saturday, and Botany Bay and Ramsgate on Sunday.\nThanet Green Party Councillor Tricia Austin said:\n“There are activities going on across the Isle: in Ramsgate, for example, there’s painting and cleaning the seafront shelters, Montefiore Woodland’s regular work party and the Ramsgate Society’s twice-yearly Chine to Chine litter pick, in Broadstairs there’s the Food Festival and litter picking, while in Cliftonville there’s beach cleaning and Thanet Biodiversity’s planting day. But if you’re not up for taking part in physically active events, we’ve also listed less arduous things, including Margate NOW’s amazing Eco Gathering at the Sunken Garden in Westbrook and a couple of webinars that you can enjoy from the comfort of your armchair!”\nPlease visit the Facebook page for more details, or contact Tricia on thanetgreenparty@gmail.com for a list of events taking place during the week.\nThe photos show activities from previous years:\nLarge group of litter pick volunteers in high viz in Ramsgate during the Ramsgate Society Chine to Chine Litter Pick Volunteers cleaning and repainting a shelter on Ramsgate seafront",

And one in four households are on Universal Credit.\nThis month (September 2021), the income of our friends and neighbours on Universal Credit is expected to drop by £1,040, or £86 a month. This will impact 18,839 individuals in Thanet, who have rent to pay, Council Tax to pay, children to feed, and utility bills to pay. Of these 18.839 people, 34% of them are in work.\nThe reduction in Universal Credit is guaranteed to impact the children of those claiming Universal Credit. There are 9,010 children classed as living in poverty in Thanet (after housing costs). This is the largest number of children of all Kent authorities according to the Kent County Council analytics department.\n33% of Thanet children, or one in three children, now live in poverty. This percentage has increased over the past five years, and with the impact of the pandemic we could see this deteriorate further.\nThis reduction to Universal Credit will mean that the spending power of Thanet, literally overnight, will reduce by £19.5 million a year. This will negatively affect local businesses and could lead to further unemployment in the area.\nWe therefore request that the UK government do not cut Universal Credit by £1,040 per year for our 18,839 friends and neighbours in Thanet, over a third of whom are in work, but keep this safeguard in place for those in our community who need it the most.\nPRIMARY SIGNATORIES:\n- Thanet Labour\n- Thanet Food Link\n- Our Kitchen on the Isle of Thanet CIC\n- Carl Whitewood, Ramsgate Salvation Army\n- Thanet Iceberg Project\n- Revd Dawn Watson\n- Tracey Emin CBE RA\n- East Kent Mind\n- Thanet Greens\n- A Better Cliftonville\n- The Gap Project, Broadstairs\n- GMB Trade Union\n- Margate Independent Foodbank CIC\n- Thanet Community Churches\n- Rabbi Cliff Cohen, Thanet & District Reform Synagogue\n- GRASS Cliftonville CIC\n- The Margate School\n- The Pavilion Youth & Community Café/Zone Youth Club, Broadstairs\n- Cliftonville Cultural Space",

I suggest three big topics for our workplan for the next 4 years ( the cost of living crisis, health & wellbeing and how we manage negative impacts of tourism). I also ask for updates at every meeting on our vitally important externally funded regeneration programmes.\nWednesday 31st May\nA chance to get out in the fresh air – and it certainly is fresh! – on the East cliff in Ramsgate, helping paint our beautiful seafront shelters with other volunteers from across Thanet. We have so many great voluntary groups helping care for our assets and environment, and as local authority funding cuts bite ever harder, I’ve no idea what we’d do without their hard work! Huge thanks to everyone who helps.\nIn the evening, a Ramsgate Town Council meeting to ratify policies and consider funding applications from community groups. So many great causes, so little money to divide between them: there are hard decisions to make, and they’re going to get harder…\nThursday 1st June\nHurrah! The election spending returns are in – a weight off my mind!\nMore casework, including finding out where to get help with an unfair trading issue. And in the evening, the Sea Cadets’ formal Navy inspection: a chance to support one of the groups doing excellent work with young people locally, helping them build skills for life and work – and have fun in the process!\nFriday 2nd June\nA rare day off – a walk and a pub lunch with my other half.\nSaturday 3rd June\nOut bright & early as usual to buy fish from Cannons on Ramsgate Harbour and bread & other goodies from The Modern Boulangerie. Then half an hour on the picket line at Ramsgate Station with ASLEF colleagues.\nUntil the recent local election campaign, we were regulars on picket lines in support of campaigns for decent wages and proper terms & conditions. I’m very proud that the Green Party has supported these workers’ struggles and wish them every success.",

  "https_thanet_greenparty_org_uk_/https_thanet_greenparty_org_uk_2020_12_04_november-councillors-update/content_138.html": "Welcome to a new feature on our website. Our busy Green local councillors will aim to bring you regular updates on their activities.\nBecky Wing (Ramsgate Central) has been very busy at Ramsgate Port and protesting tree-felling in Ellington Park and doesn’t have an update for us this week, but here are updates from Trevor and Mike.\nTrevor Roper (Thanet Villages)\n“Operation Brock” at Manston – At the Overview & Scrutiny meeting last week we were given an update on the Manston site. TDC do not yet have detailed information, but the worst-case scenario is that there will be up to 4,000 truck at the site for up to 48 hours at a time. The trucks on site are only those heading for Dover Port. It is estimated that up to 30% to 40% of trucks may not be ready with their paperwork, but that the transition will be phased until July when full control will be enforced. RiverOak claim that Operation Brock will cease in June, as by then all the teething problems will be sorted! TDC have been promised £500,00 to help with costs that have bee incurred.Concerns were expressed about the possibility of a Covid outbreak on the site as drivers are not obliged to stay on site, although toilet and food facilities will be provided. There could be problems with any fire outbreaks when all the trucks are tightly packed. Traffic build-up on the A299 Thanet Way could result in severe traffic as it may be duelled, but has no hard shoulder. To sum up –we were told that the site is not yet ready, and the officers made it very clear that TDC do not support the arrangement on the Manston site, and that frustration has been felt at the lack of detailed planning.\nParish Council Meetings – I attend as many as I can (by Zoom at the moment). Here are brief details of what is covered at the two most recent meetings. I have also regularly been to St Nicholas at Wade/Sturry, Manston and Acol Parish Council meetings.\n- Monkton – Topics included discussion on Planning applications, reports on the Recreation Ground and various policies for approval. One noticeable item was that Cllr Davina Ransom (Natasha’s Mother) had planted 29 trees in the rec.\n- Minster – Similarly Planning Applications were discussed, the transfer of the Village Car parks/toilets to the Parish from TDC. Replacement of the all weather pitch and problems with the skateboard park.\nAs with all Councillors, I get a steady trickle of emails from local residents with the most common topics being waste collection and planning.\nMike Garner (St Peters)\nI thought I’d update you on some of the stuff I do as both a Broadstairs Town and Thanet District Councillor for St Peters Ward by letting you know what I’ve been up to this week and what’s planned for next. The focus below is mainly on meetings I’ve attended (all virtual of course) but there is other stuff I do which I’ll cover in a future blog.\nThis week started on Monday morning with a meeting of the Town Council’s newly formed Environmental Working party. I chair this group and am joined by Cllrs Bob Bayford and Ruth Bailey and our tree warden, Karen McKenzie. We are currently putting together a strategy and action plan to tackle three key areas, improving air quality, biodiversity and the built environment of the town. We made a start in October by launching a Hedgehog survey and publicising ways in which we can help our dwindling population of Hedgehogs. At this week’s meeting we were joined by Lesley Game and Ros Binks, the 2 County Councillors who cover Broadstairs, to discuss what help they can give us to preserve and increase the number of street trees in the town and also how they can help us implement a 20mph speed limit in residential areas around Broadstairs, a policy we recently persuaded the Town Council to adopt. They took away a number of actions which we’ll follow up on in the near future.\nOn Monday evening I attended the meeting of the full Town Council. These are held every other month and cover a number of different items from the Council’s finances to issues arising from correspondence from residents and local organisations. At our next meeting I’ve asked for a motion calling on the Town Council to declare a Climate Emergency to be discussed. The Council now owns a number of properties, including the Town Hall and Retort House, and I’m keen that we work out our carbon footprint and work to make sure we are carbon neutral asap.\nI’m part of the Park Avenue Woodland Group who are campaigning to get TDC to take enforcement action against the owner of the area of woodland in Park Avenue who felled 40+ trees there early this year and to make sure they replant all those covered by Tree Protection Orders (TPOs). We met on Wednesday afternoon to discuss ways in which we can keep the pressure on. We’ve been told that the enforcement investigation is currently sitting with TDC’s Legal Department and we’re determined to make sure they take action.\nOn Wednesday evening I attended a meeting of TDC’s Governance and Audit Committee who are responsible for reviewing the Councils Internal and External audit functions and the council’s statement of accounts. This week’s meeting included an internal audit report on Open Spaces services which highlighted a number of issues of concern including the fact that the interim nature of management arrangements has been in place for over a year now which is obviously not good for staff morale. It also highlighted the fact that there are no KPIs in place to enable senior management to measure whether service standards are adhered to. This effectively means that there’s no way of monitoring if the correct processes are being followed, for instance the new standards adopted after the Winter Gardens Hedge Cussing fiasco in Summer 2019. I asked that this be treated seriously and it will be followed up before the next meeting in the new year. We had been due to review the External Audit review of last year’s financial statements but these were withdrawn at the last minute when “a material difference in the valuation of one of TDC’s assets” was uncovered. This was disappointing as I had wanted to ask some questions about the use of Non Disclosure Agreement (NDA)s to resolve Grievance Procedures which was highlighted in the report .\nI’m the Green Party representative on TDC’s Planning Committee and on Thursday I attended the latest mandatory training meeting. It bought us up to date on any changes we need to be aware of, especially measures relating to Coronavirus and changes to permitted development rights. We also reviewed recent appeals against Council planning decisions including the inspectors recent disappointing decision to overturn the Planning Committee’s decision to reject an application to develop on the old Club Union site near Reading Street. This was the third time the inspector had been asked to overturn a decision to reject development there.\nThursday evening also saw a Member Briefing to update us on the latest on the Margate Town Deal. TDC are close to submitting a proposal seeking £29m funding to develop a number of projects in Margate / Cliftonville, which if successful will have a positive impact on the area. As well as creating a property portfolio there is also likely to be significant investment in existing assets like the Theatre Royal and Winter Gardens and I raised a concern that these assets need to remain in community ownership and not be sold off to benefit private individuals or companies in the future. My concerns weren’t allayed.\nMike’s upcoming activities\n- Next week on Monday we have our monthly(ish) Green group (Tricia, Trevor, Becky and myself) meeting with the Leader of the Council, Rick Everitt and his Deputy, Helen Whitehead. These are a useful opportunity for them to tell us about their plans for the coming period and for us to tell them about our ideas and concerns. I’m sure we’ll be covering, among other things, planning and enforcement issues and developments at the Port.\n- On Tuesday we have another Member Briefing, this week on how the Council are tackling the pandemic and also preparing for the post Brexit future. On Wednesday we have another Park Avenue Woodland Group meeting followed by a Planning Committee.\n- On Thursday I’m going to be attending a seminar entitled “Community Energy Masterclass: Making Local Action on Climate Change Happen”.\n- Thursday evening sees an extraordinary Town Council meeting to interview and select a new Town Clerk.",

They also cast doubt on many aspects of the applicants’ submission, including the huge numbers of jobs they predicted.\nThe decision will inevitably be challenged in the Courts, meaning this sorry saga will drag on well into the future, with inevitable negative effects on us in Thanet.\nIt will also mean missed opportunities both locally and nationally to #BuildBackBetter post-Covid with sound plans for a sustainable, greener future.\nStatement from the Green Party’s national transport spokesperson Caroline Russell\n“The government talks about a green recovery, but this just goes to show that they are stuck in the old-fashioned business as usual approach.\n“Now is not the time to be giving the go ahead to opening up new airports which will only serve to increase carbon emissions and set us even further away from achieving our climate commitments.\n“The local Green Party, as part of a coalition of local groups, has been campaigning long and hard against this proposal and will continue to do so to try and prevent this senseless act which places the economic benefit of a small number of people ahead of the wellbeing of us all.”",

This has a knock-on effect on tourism which has a detrimental impact on local businesses. This has been going on for years and will continue to happen while Southern Water put profit for their multinational shareholders before fixing their infrastructure.\nBack in the early part of the Summer we were promised that Ian McAulay, the Southern Water Chief Executive, would meet Councillors to update us on their plans to fix things and answer our questions. We now know that this is going to happen in a ‘virtual’ meeting next Monday 13 September at 5.15pm.\nOne area I’ll be pressing him on is how the infrastructure is going to be upgraded, not just to cope with the current number of houses in Thanet but also the needs of the 17,000 new houses planned over the next 10 years. Maybe all new big developments need to be halted until we can be sure the infrastructure can manage without having to pollute our coastline..",

So I have an uphill task in raising environmental concerns. If you know me, you will know that the felling or loss of any of our habitat saddens me, and that I work as hard as I can to improve our ward and town.\nI love Ellington Park, and have supported the Friends of Ellington Park (FOEP) in their plans to regenerate it. Shortly after my election to the Council, I joined with FOEP to support the retention of a habitat close to the old Keeper’s Lodge, protecting a much-needed environment for flocks of birds who use it for food, shelter and nesting.\nI was worried, however, to see the cherry tree avenue being destroyed, and took part in a protest to stop it, in an attempt to promote some positive dialogue. We believed that the old cherry trees were to be replaced with small saplings similar in size to the ones being planted in Dane Park. So we suggested keeping the existing trees and planting the smaller saplings between them, so the old trees could be removed later once the saplings had grown. We also pushed to save the holm oak (photo above).\nAfter the protest, a very constructive meeting was held with senior TDC Officers, the project manager, the Council Leader and representatives of Street Trees for Ramsgate and FOEP. All were afforded the chance to speak of their concerns openly and honestly, and we were given extra information on the project and specifically plans for the cherry tree avenue.\nAfterwards we learned that FOEP in fact planned to replace the cherry trees, which were nearing the end of their lives, with larger trees of 4 – 5 metres in height, requiring space, professional planting and a year of after-care.\nAfter further discussion it was agreed that, with the long-term aim of increasing tree numbers and replanting the cherry avenue with trees mature enough to survive, grow and blossom quickly, the plans were in fact a reasonable compromise. After further discussion it was also agreed that the holm oak will stay, which is very positive for everyone visiting the park who enjoys it, and a benefit for biodiversity.\nOverall, there will be a net gain of trees in Ellington Park.\nSmall things matter. Action to protect and increase habitat, including trees, is a priority for me personally and our party. We are presently a small group with consequently little power or influence. We have to negotiate and compromise to change things and bring about the improvements we all need. We find that this approach raises awareness and sows the seeds of constructive and long-lasting changes in thinking and action on our environment.\nWe are grateful to everyone involved for the positive and respectful dialogue. Once this project is complete, we aim to undertake a full review of all the trees in Ellington Park with Street Trees for Ramsgate and FOEP. We hope to use the new TDC Tree Policy to gain tree protection orders on as many of these beautiful trees as possible, so they are fully protected well into the future, together with the biodiversity reliant on their survival.",

During the election campaign we called for a halt to further major planning application approvals until the work to upgrade their infrastructure has been completed. A pause now would enable us to review not just the Southern Water issues, but also the serious impacts on our road network and health services, and to determine whether developments that have been completed have delivered the affordable housing that was promised.”\n“I’m sure Councillors from all parties have been contacted by residents about their concerns and I look forward to hearing from a number of them during the debate next week.”\nCross party working group\nThe suggestion is to set up a cross-party working group of seven councillors to work with officers to carry out the review, using the Treasury Green Book Gate Review process as a guide.\nThe Green Party says the Office of National Statistics data being used to calculate housing need is incorrect – something also stated by witnesses at the Shottendane development public enquiry, including North Thanet MP Sir Roger Gale.\nThe Local Plan sets out the strategy for future development and was adopted for Thanet in July 2020. It runs to the period up to 2031.\nThe council has been preparing a ‘partial update’ of the Local Plan to extend it up to 2040. This is updating certain parts of the Plan and reviewing topics that previous Local Plan Inspectors recommended, it is not an update of the whole Plan.\nThe Green Party has a national plan to address the UK’s housing crisis contained in its Right Homes, Right Place, Right Price Charter published in April of this year. To learn more about the charter click HERE.\nThe motion in full\nMotion to pause the granting of new planning permissions for builds of more than 10 dwellings, and allow for a review into the impacts the current house-building programme is having across Thanet.\nWhile it is important that new homes are built in Thanet, and Thanet Green Party is committed to ensuring that all our residents have comfortable, sustainable places to live, it is likely that the continual increases in mortgage interest rates will have a slow-down effect on both the build of new homes and of their purchase, possibly for the rest of 2023.\nThis presents us with an opportunity to pause the granting of new planning applications for builds of more than 10 dwellings, and review and address the concerns of residents. Questions we need to find answers to should include::\n- Southern Water’s infrastructure is not fit for purpose to service the current households and businesses in the district. What impact will the proposed number of new dwellings have on the current residents in Thanet and on the environment around our coastline because of increased sewage releases?\n- There are too many dwellings across Thanet which remain unoccupied. How many empty properties are there across the district and what are the reasons they remain empty?\n- How many previously approved planning applications are still to commence development?\n- How many of the already approved numbers of affordable homes have been built and made available at an affordable price?\n- Have the GP surgeries, primary schools and social amenities promised in previously approved planning applications been adequately delivered by the builders?\n- What is the impact of the recent new builds on traffic and highways in Thanet?\nThis Council agrees to pause the granting of new planning permissions, for builds of more than 10 dwellings, and set up a cross-party working group of 7 Councillors to work with officers to carry out the review, using the Treasury Green Book Gate Review (see link below) process as a guide for that review.\nFor more information please contact Cllr Mike Garner\nTel 07747 773 279",

Their reasons included the simple fact that there is no need for a new cargo hub at Manston, with spare capacity at many other airports, as well as the threat it poses to the Government achieving its climate commitments.\nThe Government’s irrational decision to overturn the Planning Inspectorate’s recommendations in the face of all the evidence was completely baffling. “\nGreen Cllr Becky Wing added:\n“And this was before the Coronavirus pandemic with its devastating effect on aviation. In the new reality, it is surely difficult to justify a new airport anywhere in the UK – let alone one right next to a town of 45,000 people and a marine Site of Special Scientific Interest!”\nGreen Cllr Trevor Roper pointed out:\n“For the climate’s sake, as well as for the health and wellbeing of our communities, we need a Green Recovery with efficient alternatives to noisy, polluting, climate-damaging aviation.

Key to solving many of them, in our view, is to improve Thanet’s prosperity by working for a clean, green recovery following the Covid pandemic.\nCentral to prosperity is jobs – decent, sustainable jobs with training and prospects. With two successful wind farms in the area, and an abundance of wind, wave and solar power in our coastal district, we believe Thanet has great potential to become a centre for sustainable energy and clean technologies, with our Universities and Colleges working to support this through research and training.\nKCC can help by stimulating new business investment and seeking support from Government, the SE Local Enterprise Partnership and other potential funding sources, as well as actively supporting existing local businesses through its purchasing policy.\nAt present we do not believe Thanet gets nearly enough attention from KCC. If elected, we will push hard for the County Council to focus much more on addressing the issues in disadvantaged areas like Thanet, where more investment would make a real, practical difference. Alongside this, we will work hard ourselves as Divisional Councillors to attract business, research and training investment for a green recovery.\nAnd at a simple, practical level, we’ll also focus on ensuring KCC also provides the basic services that our Council tax funds – things like clearing drains, planting and maintaining street trees and mending potholes, which make a visible difference to our quality of life and the experience of the visitors our local economy relies on.",

But in reality, Headteachers have neither the space nor the personnel to manage Covid-secure testing in schools at the rate promised by the Government.\nUnable to access vaccines, staff, pupils and parents are increasingly concerned about the risk of infection, with the new variant proving both more prevalent among the young and significantly more infectious.\nWorking with communities across Thanet, our Councillors hear these concerns.\nCllr Becky Wing commented: “As a teacher myself, I know how important school attendance is, especially for vulnerable children and those with special needs. Key workers need to know that their children are safe at school while they work on the front line to support us all. But we must balance the benefits of being in school against the health of the community as a whole.“\n“Here in Thanet, Covid-19 infections are on the rise again. Hospitals are overwhelmed, with more than double the number of serious Covid-19 cases than in the first wave. Staff are stretched to the maximum, unable to meet safe nursing requirements for the most seriously ill, but with no sign of respite. Sending all children back to school in these circumstances is madness, and risks burdening young people and their parents with the results of the Government’s poor decision-making.”\nThanet Green Councillors are calling on the Government to provide joined-up community-wide policy-making to reduce the spread of the virus, by ensuring safe school-based learning for those who need it most, facilitating home-learning for the rest, rethinking exam policy for this summer and beyond – and above all, by providing clarity, leadership and planning for the future.\nNote: The Green Party nationally has called on the Government to ‘back its own call to follow the science’ by moving learning online for all schools from Monday. It has also repeated its call for all frontline workers, including teachers, to be prioritised for vaccination.",

The Government’s housing targets, embedded in Thanet District Council’s (TDC) Local Plan, call for the construction of more than 17,000 homes in the area by 2030, adding another 4,500 by 2040. And, as anyone who has driven out of Thanet to the west can see, the plan is very much in action with new developments springing up everywhere from Westgate to Cliffsend.\nBut the plan raises some very serious questions. Do we really need this number of houses? Can they be supported by the already creaking infrastructure? Are they being built in the right place? Are they the right kind of houses?\nThese questions prompted Cllr Mike Garner, the Thanet Greens Chair, to propose a motion that calls on TDC to pause the granting of new planning permissions for builds of more than 10 dwellings and allow for a review into the impacts the current house-building programme is having across Thanet. The motion will be debated at the TDC meeting on Thursday 12th October. The meeting is open to the public so please come and support the motion. It starts at 7pm in the Council Chamber, Council Offices, Cecil St, Margate CT9 1XZ.\nTo read the motion in full click HERE.\nInfrastructure problems\nSpeaking about the motivation behind the motion, Cllr Garner said, “We’re all familiar with the concerns about Southern Water’s infrastructure. It is not fit for purpose, either to consistently guarantee a supply of fresh drinking water to us all or to effectively deal with the associated sewage and any heavy rainfall without polluting the sea, devastating the biodiversity around the coastline and impacting local businesses, especially during the tourist season.\n“Other infrastructure related concerns we are all familiar with are the impacts on GP surgeries, the hospital, schools, and of course the road network.\n“The housebuilding programme also raises a number of other questions which need to be addressed.\n– How many previously approved planning applications are being sat on by developers?\n– Why are so many properties left empty and not made available as primary residences, including many of the new houses being built?\n– How many previously approved affordable homes have actually been built and made available at affordable prices?\n“I’m sure we’ve all had similar conversations with residents on their concerns about the infrastructure impacts I’ve mentioned, concerns I’m sure that featured prominently in most of our election campaigns and concerns which get raised regularly when significant planning applications are discussed around the District, from Westwood to Birchington, via Westgate and Garlinge.\nThe motion was featured on the BBC News website in August. See their piece HERE.\nGreens’ housing charter\nNationally the Green Party is calling for a radical change in the way we build new homes and use land. The party’s co-leader Adrian Ramsay said,\n“Today, speculators and developers are allowed to chase the biggest profits and ignore local needs. Too many villages and towns have seen large-scale developments take place without the community infrastructure expanded alongside, such as GP surgeries, bus services, cycling and walking networks and nurseries and schools.\n“We need councillors and national government to work together to deliver the homes people need and can afford to rent and buy, where people need them.\n“What we need is local councils supported to build quality, affordable housing in the right places where people live and work, with the right supporting infrastructure and local facilities.\n“Our Right Homes, Right Place, Right Price Charter will simultaneously protect valuable green space for communities, reduce climate emissions, tackle fuel poverty and provide genuinely affordable housing.\nTo learn more about the Right Homes, Right Place, Right Price Charter click HERE.",

This would stop water companies dumping sewage in our seas and only the Greens have the courage to commit to this.\nI’d push for affordable, secure and comfortable homes for everyone – and it’s Green Party policy to insulate all new builds and retrofit insulation to older homes so we can keep bills down and reduce carbon emissions.\nFourteen years of Tory austerity have left this country in a parlous state, everything is in disrepair from health to education to the potholes in the roads.

Here he highlights the threat to nature posed by our society’s love affair with single use plastic.\nThis article originally appeared in The Isle of Thanet News\nWe have only recycled 10% of 7 billion tons of plastic\nThanet is gifted with a wonderful coastline and prime agricultural land but do we really value it?\nDo national and international governments throughout the world care as they continue to resist legislation to thwart the production of single use plastics?\nAs quoted by the United Nations world society has, ‘only recycled about 10% of the 7 billion tons of plastic we have created since its invention and things are likely to only get worse’. Simon Reeves Plastic in the Med | Mediterranean with Simon Reeve | The Mediterranean has a serious plastic problem. | By BBC Two | Facebook shows implications.\nSociety claims to be concerned about the generation to come yet it is willing to sacrifice this for supposedly convenient packaging that has damaging consequences for soils, seas, food systems, biodiversity and yes, our health. We are quick to fly the flag of the NHS and rightly so, but do we not have the responsibility to prevent illness in the first place as government, local authorities and as individuals and businesses?\nFish choked by plastic wasteGovernment ban\nThis is another example of lack of full systems thinking. Nature does not produce waste like we do. It has effective recycling systems keyed into its very functioning. If we are to live on a healthy diverse planet and by the way, diversity is now diminishing and this is why the new geological age is here – the Anthropocene 7th mass extinction caused by us humans. The diversity of the planet is being diminished and single use plastics are playing a massive part in this decline.\nWe need governments to completely ban single use plastics and enable local authorities to have the financial resources to set up commercial composting facilities that would adequately compost truly biodegradable compostable packaging. The government needs to enable the creation of networks from product manufacture to product sale to consumer waste and then commercial composting a merry go round of efficient use, a cyclical system. As a bonus these systems could produce energy to houses and council facilities etc. Our current systems of production to waste are inadequate to create these cyclical approaches.\nPolluted beach after a storm.young people lead the fight back\nYoung inspirational people like Ella and Amy Meek @kidsagainstplastic, Myra Rose Craig, Vanessa Nakate, Daniel Koto Dagnon @DanielKotoDAGNON, Greta Thunberg, Nyombi Morris, Lesein Mutunkei, Luisa Neubauer, Autumn Peltier and Malala Yousafzai are leading thinkers who see the harm our present systems are wreaking.\nDon’t the young, other creatures, the biodiverse habitats we share the world with, that supply us with water, food and air to breathe, deserve better?

If you want real change and real hope in the NHS there is one party that is offering to make that a reality”Costed and funded\nThe full details of the funding for the plans will be presented in the Green Manifesto but speaking on Radio 4’s Today programme Adrian outlined the key ideas. Firstly a “modest”wealth tax aimed at millionaires and billionaires, second a windfall tax on the vast profits currently being made by fossil fuels corporations and thirdly a change to capital gains tax to bring the tax paid on earnings from assets in to line with the tax paid on earnings from work.

It is the biggest problem that humanity faces and so naturally it can seem daunting and overwhelming.\nAdded to which it is shrouded in misinformation. There are still people, like Thanet MP Craig MacKinley, who try to play down, or even deny, the seriousness of the situation and then there are the vested interests like the oil and other fossil fuels companies who have spent millions trying to hide the truth, putting their corporate profits before peoples lives and indeed the future of the human race.\nCommon Myths about climate change and why they are wrong\nTo counter the confusion and prepare us for the next time we meet a climate change denying Faragesque bore, Thanet Green Party member Phil Shotton has created this epic list of some of the key ideas and myths that are used to deny the existence of the climate crisis. And here they are.\n- The earth’s climate has always changed.\nTrue, but the changes happening in the past took hundreds of thousands of years, now they’re happening in decades. And global temperatures are at their highest since records began. Scientists are united in stating that this is not normal climatic variation, and the effects will be (and already are) massive. - Scientists don’t agree that climate change is happening or caused by humans\nThe scientific method permits (even encourages) dissent. However around 97% of climate experts agree that humans are causing global warming, and the greater the expertise on climate matters, the higher this number. Who would you rather believe? - Increasing carbon dioxide is beneficial to plants.\nWithin limits, true, but the increase we’re seeing in CO2 vastly outstrips plant consumption and causes effects (warming, higher sea levels, climate effects, etc) that will cause more damage to plant growth. Temperate latitudes may be able to grow more tropical crops at the expense of existing staple varieties such as wheat and corn, but more equatorial regions will see a significant fall, causing not just food shortages but mass migration of people who can no longer feed themselves. - Climate change is a future problem, I can ignore it for now.\nThere are fewer and fewer climate deniers, but there’s been a big increase in climate delayers, those who say we can wait and something in the future will make it all better. The problem is that the bigger the problem gets (and it’s getting bigger every year) the harder it is to reverse. If we had cut back a little on burning fossil fuels 30 years ago then the steps needed would have been much less severe than now. In 5 years time it may actually be too late to do anything at all. There are currently no mitigation technologies (such as carbon-capture) that work with sufficient capacity, to ameliorate climate change. - Renewable energy is too expensive\nRight now the cheapest way of generating electricity is onshore wind power, closely followed by offshore wind and photovoltaic (solar). Gas, coal and oil generation are already more expensive. Renewable energy costs will continue to fall (once you’ve built a wind-farm or a solar array the ongoing costs are negligible) but gas, oil and coal costs will continue to rise and, as we have seen, are at the mercy of political forces. The environmental, health and climate impact of fossil fuels and the subsidies they receive are not included in their cost. If they were, the cost of fossil fuel would be many times higher. - It’s not our problem, it’s other countries or the number of people in the world.\nCompletely false. In comparison to developing countries including China and India our per-capita energy consumption is far higher than theirs. And the western northern hemisphere’s historic contribution to CO2 levels is hugely more than other countries. It’s a global problem and we all must play our part. - Renewables can’t provide electricity when it’s dark or there’s no wind.\nThis is superficially true. However, with linked grids (which we already have) there will always be somewhere that is generating, and when there is surplus in one place it can be delivered to other regions. In addition, energy storage is available now and improving in leaps and bounds. We can store electricity in batteries, by pumping water uphill to release it downhill later to drive turbines, by storing it as heat in our homes (heating water tanks during the day to release heat at night) and many others. - We can adapt to climate change\nWe, as the human race, will certainly adapt to climate change. But the adapted world will be very different, and the adapting process will be very painful. Hundreds of millions of people will be displaced from their homelands to seek sanctuary elsewhere. Food and water supplies will be restricted. Many animal and plant species will become extinct. These changes are already happening. They will only get worse. - It’s too expensive to ‘go green’\nIt’s too expensive not to. Those that argue that we can’t afford it ignore the huge costs that will be incurred if we do nothing. Addressing climate change will cost a huge amount of money, but will also create millions of jobs, reduce health expenditure, travel costs, heating bills and others. Not addressing climate change will cost even bigger sums of money in adaptation – moving cities away from coastal flooding, improving coastal defences, adapting medical services to handle tropical diseases, pest infestations and similar climate related changes. - Going green will make Britain uncompetitive. Completely false. Britain used to be a world leader in green technology, but now it’s a (distant) runner up. Countries (like China) that have invested in battery production, solar panel production, wind turbine production, are already reaping the rewards. Our vehicle production, our manufacturing industries, our house building are already way behind other countries in their commitment to energy conservation and emissions reduction. We use too much energy domestically through poor insulation, inefficient heating and expensive travel. With joined-up policies we could live more economically, in more comfort, with a modern workforce building the materials and technologies that the world will need in the future. The alternative doesn’t bear thinking about.",

Nationally a record gain of 200 seats was the biggest growth in a single step in the Party’s 50 year history.\nTrue Opposition\nGreens became the largest party in several councils across the country, including Lewes, where the Conservatives were wiped out, and East Hertfordshire, where they took 17 seats from the Conservatives. In all there were 155 gains from the Tories cementing the Greens as the true opposition to the government in many places.\nMajority control\nIn Mid Suffolk Greens gained majority control of a local authority for the first time. The leader of Mid Suffolk Greens Andy Mellen said votes for the Green Party can no longer be considered as purely a protest against the other main parties. “We are a serious political party. We got 57% of the vote in Mid Suffolk, we gained seats right across the region. I don’t think we can call it a protest vote any more.”\nGreens double tally in Kent\nIn Kent Greens more than doubled their tally of seats from 21 to 47 across the county, and achieved a majority for the first time in Folkestone and Hythe. See below for the council by council gains.\nGreen gains as Thanet goes labour\nIn Thanet, where the Labour Party now controls the authority, the four re-elected existing Green councillors, Tricia Austin, Becky wing, Abi Smith and Mike Garner, will be joined on the District Council by Kevin Pressland, who won a second Green seat in St Peter’s Ward.

Both are essential if the partnership necessary for the effective and efficient running of the Council is to succeed.”\nYet amidst turmoil and mutual recrimination, trust between elected members and senior officers at TDC (and indeed within the officer group and amongst members) is under considerable strain.\nAllegations of bullying and harassment, the suspension for undisclosed reasons of a well-respected senior officer, threats by the Chief Executive to refer an elected member to the Standards Committee and suggestions that a motion of No Confidence in the Leader of the Council is imminent all paint a picture of an organisation in crisis.\nFinancial concerns\nMeanwhile, TDC’s financial picture is equally worrying, with substantial sums paid out in non-disclosure (gagging) settlements with former staff, ‘fire sales’ of assets, little staff capacity to bid for or manage external funding, hurried sale plans for the Dreamland complex and the proposed ‘emergency’ £1m spend on pontoons for Ramsgate port, now apparently halted as breaking financial rules.\nIt appears increasingly unlikely that the Council will be able to set a balanced budget for the 2019-20 financial year, particularly in light of the continuing suspension of its chief financial officer.\nProfessional expertise?\nThe Member-Officer Protocol also states:\n“Together Members & Officers combine the essential skills, experience & knowledge to manage an effective public sector organisation…”\nSadly, it is the considered view of Thanet Green Party that this is no longer the case – that between them, officers and members have emphatically not shown they have the range of skills and expertise that are now required to run the Council effectively.\nSo we have reluctantly concluded that members need to ask for external help for TDC now – before this is imposed on us and the Council placed in special measures.\nWhy now?\nAsking for help now has several things to recommend it:\n- It’s the responsible thing to do, while there is still hope of turning things round.\n- It gives Councillors the chance to do what we elected them to do (ie take control) – even if they do so by admitting they urgently need help!\n- It may help avoid the Councillors we elected to represent us being suspended for up to 6 months at some point in future, as is likely to happen if they cannot fulfil their legal duty to set a balanced budget and the Council is compulsorily placed in special measures.",

We believe KCC should be considering electric shuttle-bus services to and from stations at peak times to obviate the need for expanded car parks and offering fully integrated ticketing with bus and ferry services. In particular, we believe KCC must work with bus service providers to ensure that the new Thanet Parkway station (the need for which we still question) is properly served by public transport. At present most travellers will have little choice but to travel there by car – a very poor outcome for an Authority with clear climate change commitments.\nWe welcome the proposals to introduce more flexible season ticketing in response to increased home-working, but believe that substantially more work also needs to be done with South Eastern to find ways to bring down peak-time fares. Peak-time travel is often the only option for lower-paid workers with fixed working hours, but the current hugely expensive peak fare regime (under which travel from Thanet to London at peak time costs more than travel from Thanet to Glasgow off-peak) denies this to all but the best paid (whose working hours are often more flexible, ironically.) For people in poorer areas like Thanet, access to jobs further afield is a lifeline, but the present fare scales directly encourage workers to get into their cars, as they can travel substantially more cheaply by road, thereby clogging up our roads and militating against KCC’s efforts to combat climate change.\nFares Policy:\nWe strongly support increased flexibility in peak-time and season ticket options, ‘shoulder peak’ fares and expanded super-off-peak provision and a Smartcard scheme to facilitate integrated bus/ train travel.\nWe believe funding options to enable peak-time fares to be reduced considerably (- even if only for certain groups, such as lower-waged or vulnerable travellers -) must be fully explored. Currently, peak-time fares are excessive and militate against both the regeneration of poorer areas like Thanet and the achievement of KCC’s climate change ambitions.\nWe would argue that clearer, simpler, ticketing options and improved communication to passengers on how to ensure they get best value for money with their ticket purchases are essential if the ambition to increase rail travel and reduce road travel is to be realised.\nRail Infrastructure Enhancement:\nWe support power enhancements for all lines linking with HS1. We continue to believe that the money spent on Thanet Parkway Station would have been much better spent on improvements to lines and power enhancements to support faster, smoother travel and fewer breakdowns across the network. (We accept that the bulk of this is LEP money but believe KCC and others should have lobbied the LEP more vigorously to make more effective use of the funds on offer to improve existing stations and services rather than create an unstaffed eighth station in Thanet on greenfield land.) We are concerned that smaller stations may suffer from the introduction of new stations such as Parkway and believe this would be a retrograde development that would run contrary to KCC’s climate and community commitments.\nRolling Stock Improvements:\nWe believe upgrading and modernisation of the available rolling stock is necessary to ensure we have a service that passengers want to use, and the capability to increase the volume of freight that travels by rail rather than by road.\nPassenger Services:\nWe strongly support increased service capacity on all lines, a faster service from Ramsgate via Herne Bay with better links to the Dover Service and more frequent services to minor stations between Faversham and Dover. We retain serious doubts about the value to Thanet of the new Parkway Station, but agree that, in order to justify its massive cost both financially and environmentally, it must be made a mandatory stop for all High Speed and Mainline services.\nCommunity Rail Partnerships:\nWe are delighted to see the Strategy’s commitment to expanding Community Rail Partnerships, and are particularly pleased that our own area of Thanet is benefiting from a new partnership. We hope to see more information about this shortly. We would stress the importance of clear, simple communication about these partnerships and their work to passengers and the general public, and of integrating these with other travel, housing and regeneration information in each local area.\nRail Freight Provision:\nWe strongly support the proposals for better utilisation of existing rail freight paths in the short term and improvements to Mainline routes in the longer term to facilitate an increase in the percentage of freight travelling by rail in Kent.\nWith the expected delays on Kent roads post-Brexit caused by our reliance on road freight, anything that can be done in the very short term to increase the attractiveness to logistics companies of a move from road to rail would be hugely welcome to Kent communities in terms of their overall quality of life and the quality of the air they breathe.\nInternational Rail Services:\nWe strongly support the restoration of Eurostar services to Ashford and Ebbsfleet as soon as conditions permit and the proposed increases in services between Kent and Lille, Brussels and Amsterdam. Once again, in order to meet our climate commitments we must make rail travel to mainland Europe as easy, cheap and attractive as possible in order for it to complete with air services. We believe Eurostar offers an excellent service and would urge KCC, ABC and SELEP to develop a more dynamic communications strategy to promote it.",

Some years ago, an Ofgem Audit found that Discovery Park Commercial Biomass was burning wood harvested from old growth forests in Latvia and Estonia.\nA recent Panorama programme has exposed this behaviour in the commercial biomass industry. Drax, which runs Britain’s biggest power station and receives billions of pounds in green energy subsidies from UK taxpayers, is cutting down environmentally-important forests to produce wood pellets which are then classed as renewable. The BBC discovered that some of the wood comes from primary forests in Canada that have taken thousands of years to develop.\nAbsolutely insane\nEcologist Michelle Connolly said “It’s really a shame that British taxpayers are funding this destruction with their money. Logging natural forests and converting them into pellets to be burned for electricity, that is absolutely insane”.\nDrax has already received £6bn in green energy subsidies, and is to receive even more to build a carbon capture and sequestration plant. If these sums had been instead used to build solar and wind farms these would have produced far more electricity for much less CO2 generation, and in the process reduce our electricity bills and improve our energy security.\nThe case for small scale biomass\nSmall scale biomass clearly has its place on farms, where extracting excess wood through good woodland management can both increase biodiversity of woodland, extract quality timber and use the remaining wood for biomass. Even better is to leave the remaining wood to decompose and add to the soil biome and mycorrhizal life of the woodland, creating life for a diverse range of species in wood habitat piles.\nFarmers with woodland could actually gain by using additional wood cuttings to create biochar (a charcoal-like wood product). Crumbled and put into the soil biochar increases soil carbon sequestration and improves soil structure and vitality.\nThe Green response\nThe Green Party supports and encourages practices like these that look at the whole solution for the benefit of people, biodiversity and the planet’s health, rather than provide public money to industries hiding behind the fig-leaf of greenwashing.\nSteve Roberts, Green Party Parliamentary candidate for Thanet East commented that ‘It is shocking that timber from old growth forest is not only being burned to create energy, it is being shipped to Kent and burned on our doorstep. It is disgraceful that this practice has been funded by the UK government’.\nWhen will the three main parties finally admit their support of Commercial Biomass was wrong?",

Under these circumstances, we felt it would not be right for us to seek to profit electorally from Councillor Green’s resignation, and accordingly we have decided not to stand a Green Party candidate in this by-election.”",

And the one on 19-20th December, which the company admits lasted for more than 24 hours, should have triggered a payment of £60 to all residents.\nAs for the company’s long-term infrastructure plan Mike continued,\n“We all know that, as it stands, Southern Water’s Water Supply and Treatment infrastructure is not fit for purpose. If it were, we would not have had frequent water outages over the last few months and you would not be regularly pumping sewage off our coastline, as has been happening, and not improving, for a number of years now. As reported by SOS Whitstable, in the 167 hours that elapsed between Episodes 1 and 2 of Paul Whitehouse’s ‘Our Troubled Rivers’ series, you released 931 hours worth of sewage into the waterways across the South East. A normal week for Southern Water? This is completely unacceptable.”\nGo Green and Join the fight against filth!\nIf you would like to get involved in the struggle for clean seas and clean water go to the Thanet Green Party ‘What we stand for’ page to find out about Green policies. GREENS ARE THE ONLY PARTY THAT PLANS TO TAKE THE WATER INDUSTRY BACK INTO PUBLIC OWNERSHIP!\nParty Joint Leader Adrian Ramsey stated in a recent speech, “Not only should (water company) shareholder payouts be halted immediately, but ultimately, to end leaks, stop sewage discharges and cut bills we need to take the water supply back into public ownership, which is what the Green Party believes must be done at the earliest practicable opportunity.”\nYou can learn more and see the discussion that followed Mike’s speech and Southern water’s presentation by clicking on the link below:",

Here is her candidate statement:\nAfter visiting the area six years ago, I knew I had found my home. I love Thanet’s beautiful countryside, stunning coast, colourful history and very special people.\nI quickly put down roots here, volunteering with local organisations including several years with Thanet Citizens Advice. That gave me an insight into the character and resilience of local people, and the challenges they face.\nProfessionally, I have campaigned for global public health campaigns and national think tanks. Moving here I looked for similar work, but after freelancing in my field for a few years, I was drawn in a different direction: I now run a small business that supports people with disabilities in work, from my home in Westgate.\nAs a Thanet Villages Councillor, I would dedicate myself to:\n- fighting for housing, health, education and the services our communities need\n- protecting trees, green spaces and play areas; our beautiful countryside and heritage\n- opposing inappropriate and damaging housing developments on precious farmland\n- better traffic management, with more affordable and reliable transport links\n- recognising the threats of climate change and damage to the environment\n- improved prospects for everyone – especially the elderly, young and vulnerable\nThe Green Party is not about power and control: it is about open dialogue and positive action for change; being willing to oppose the business-as-usual, jobs-for-the-boys status quo when necessary. But we do not create conflict for its own sake, and we are willing to cooperate with other parties to bring about better policy and better outcomes for the communities we represent.\nThe Thanet Villages ward currently has two Conservative councillors and one Green. I want to continue Trevor Roper’s work, turning up to Parish councils, hearing local concerns and acting on them. The Green Party has no vested interests and no party whip. We have nothing to lose by pushing for what’s right, and we don’t need to support the demands of central government when they don’t work for our communities.\nI believe it’s time to do politics differently, standing up for the people and places of the Villages.",

The port was closed for several days, re-opening too late for many of the stranded lorry drivers to get home for Christmas.\nOn 22nd December Priti Patel claimed just shy of 900 lorries at Manston – but local people took aerial photographs which suggested it was unlikely the number could be this low. By 23rd December the rumour was that all 4000 available parking bays had been filled.\nIn Thanet, which ranks high on national indices of deprivation, the overburdened and underfunded council works hard to create an enjoyable place to live with community veg plots and befriending schemes a-plenty.\nThis year food banks are striving to ensure all residents are fed and the Thanet Winter Shelter and Salvation Army are working hard to keep people out of the worst of the weather.\nIn this midst of a particularly hard season financially, the closing of Dover days before Christmas meant a new need was created.\nThanet council and the Thanet people were not responsible for the lorries the Government had parked within its boundaries. Yet humanity meant they could not stand by and watch as drivers went hungry, in scenes resembling refugee aid queues – so they took action, from making hundreds of bacon sandwiches to donating to pizza companies ferrying hot meals to the drivers.\nThe government itself voted back in October to refuse to continue feeding their own hungry schoolchildren over the school holidays.\nPriti Patel and her colleagues’ views on aid and charity are clear. But instead of arriving at Westminster, cold, tired, and separated from their families, the lorry drivers ‘landed’ in Thanet.\nAnd Thanet people, overwhelmingly, are a strong community. They are truly remarkable within a crisis and have enormous humanity and kindness.\nThey couldn’t have wanted for a more loving place to be.\nYou see, whilst the news remembers the rise of Farage and anti-European sentiment within the area, Thanet really isn’t like that.\nWe’re a caring, community-focused place where most people know their neighbours and look out for each other. Where litter picks on the beach are multi-political-party events and there’s always someone to walk your dog when you’re sick.\nThanks in part to the high speed trainline to London, we’re also fast becoming a diverse and accepting community.\nSure, there are a number of people whose thoughts and attitudes aren’t community-minded but they are, I’m pleased to say, in the minority.\nOn the whole, Thanet also prides itself on being excellent within a crisis.\nThe Dunkirk rescue and “little ships” that started from Ramsgate were a shining example of this.\nDunkirk spirit to me is not about Rule Britannia, it’s about ordinary people doing extraordinary things. It’s about people coming together in a crisis.\nThat night in Ramsgate, this is exactly what happened. Local people worked together, not just to save the soldiers, but to feed them and clothe them when they arrived – again, whilst barely having enough resources to feed and clothe their own townspeople.\nThe little ships weren’t just about British people saved by British people. Faced with a government who were only able to do too little too late, everyday people gave tiny amounts of time each. Little actions. Little lights.\nWhat’s so often forgotten is the Little Ships didn’t discriminate between soldiers. They saved French and Belgian allied soldiers too, taking them to safety and looking after them in our tiny town.\nDunkirk spirit is not about jingoism and nationalism. It’s about humanity.\nThanet, so famous for this already, has made me proud once again over Christmas.\nLittle lights.\nEvery action matters.",

Because in a climate emergency, everything is at stake.”\nThe ruling is binding and can trickle down to influence the law in 46 countries in Europe including the UK.\nSwitzerland failed to comply with its duties\nThe Court ruled that Switzerland had “failed to comply with its duties under the Convention concerning climate change” and that it had violated the right to respect for private and family life.\nIt also found that “there had been critical gaps” in the country’s policies to tackle climate change including failing to quantify reductions in greenhouse gases – those gases that warm Earth’s atmosphere when we burn fossil fuels like oil, coal and gas.",

That means being tougher with developers over requiring a higher proportion of genuinely affordable and homes to rent and to buy as part of new developments. Equally developers must be made to honour real commitments to invest in local services that housebuilding does put additional pressure on.\nThis all can be done and still reverse the disastrous decline in biodiversity and protect local democracy. But this has to be done with communities, including through strengthening the role of neighbourhood plans, not imposed onto them by profit driven developers.\nAnd Ministers should be taking this opportunity to look in the round at the housing crisis, and prioritising funds for increasing supply and ending right to buy, alongside building the right homes in the right place and the right price.\nAs it stands, this planning framework confirms many of the fears of those who not only want to protect this country’s degraded nature. We are not on course to meet most of the legally-binding nature recovery targets we have signed up to and this Planning Framework makes it even less likely we will hit them. This is more than a missed opportunity, it’s a dereliction of duty. We can and we must tackle both the housing crisis and the nature crisis. This new NPPF currently does neither.\nThe Government isn’t only bringing more and more land into its definition of ‘grey belt’ which can be built on, it is removing any local democratic say in the process. The deputy prime minister’s claim that this will remove “chaos and subjectiveness” from the system doesn’t wash. People have the right to have a say over major changes to their local community. This is local democracy in action.”\n12 December 2024 / 12 December 2024 by Green Party",

Evidently he’s now decided it’s our turn.”\nIn researching his recent blog on Cllr Trevor Roper, Mr Driver found out and publicised how much Cllr Roper sold his house for, used mapping software to locate where he was when joining an online meeting, and obtained his correspondence with TDC’s Democratic Services Department via a Freedom of Information request. Cllr Roper commented: “We face so many serious issues in Thanet: perhaps Ian could have put all this effort into pursuing Southern Water or Gladman Developments, rather than stalking me online and then jumping to unwarranted conclusions?”\nAfter selling their house in Minster last year, Cllr Roper and his wife Karen rented in Ramsgate for a few months and later stayed with relatives in Maidstone. During this time he continued with his Council duties as usual, including attending many parish council meetings in his Thanet Villages ward, for which he has chalked up nearly 100% attendance since his election in 2019. When travel was allowed again, the Ropers went to France to realise their retirement dream of buying a French property – only to find themselves stuck there by increasingly restrictive Covid rules and trouble obtaining vaccinations. Cllr Roper continued to attend online meetings and undertake other duties from a distance, but could not leave France – so since physical meetings restarted in May, he has been unable to attend.\nMr Driver’s blog claims Cllr Roper has behaved “deceitfully” – but colleagues insist he has deceived no-one, and his only error was forgetting to update TDC’s Register of Members’ Interests to show he had sold his Minster property.\nCllr Roper had contemplated resigning as a Councillor when he was first stuck in France, but was persuaded by colleagues to wait to see if things improved so he could return. Unfortunately, concerns about the new variant and ever stricter quarantine rules have prevented this.\nLeader of the Green group on TDC, Cllr Mike Garner, commented: “Trevor is an excellent local Councillor whose attendance record compares favourably to most other Councillors”, even when his recent inability to attend meetings is included!

It is so wasteful. There are no solar panels, no rain water harvesting and all the houses are fitted with new gas boilers.”\n“Hilariously the only nod to the climate emergency is they have all been fitted with electric car chargers!”\nMissed opportunity\n“They’ve missed a perfect opportunity to provide solar, rainwater harvesting and ground source heat pumps. All of which are much cheaper and efficient as part of a new build.”\n“Thanet Green Party will do everything it can to ensure that planners work with developers so that sustainable methods of heating, cooling and saving water are fitted as standard. In the long term this will not only be good for the environment but it will save the residents a lot of money. It should be enforced at the planning stage for all new residential and commercial developments.”\ngreener and cheaper\nDeb’s expertise in this field is based on many years experience in housing, property management and development. With her husband Phil she renovated a large early Victorian house in Ramsgate, fitting a heat pump, solar panels, rainwater harvesting and excellent insulation, to create a very warm, efficient and cost effective home.\n“The capital outlay involved in the installation will have been dwarfed by the savings we make in energy costs by the end of 5 years, two years inside the usual 7 year pay back or return period. In mid-winter, with us and our Ukrainian refugee family in permanent residence, and with regular visits from family, our energy bills for a large five bedroom house were no more than £230 per month. This includes charging our electric car. In the summer months our bills last year hovered around the £30 – £50 mark per month.”\n“As I said, we were lucky. We were in a position to retrofit and could afford to do so. Not having gas, we save more than £100 on standing charges alone, and feel much safer not have gas in the house. “\n“However the costs of installing vastly more efficient ground source heat pumps, huge rainwater harvesting systems and solar panes in new housing developments are about a third the cost of retrofitting.”\nDeb Shotten and Vitas Bowyer Green party candidates for Cliffsend and PegwellNew houses should be built to be sustainable\nWhy is this not mandated? Why are buyers of new homes not being protected from rising energy prices and worldwide supply problems? Under our sunny coastal skies, solar panels are prodigiously effective. There should be no excuse for not covering every single roof with as many as they can take. Can you imagine the difference this would make!\nThose politicians who excuse the lack of progress in this are by stating that the sun doesn’t always shine, completely miss the point, just as they do when they claim the same for wind, and wind power. These resources are clean and free for us to harness, the technology is improving all the time, the sustainability of panels and turbines is increasing vastly and the sun will shine and the wind will blow.\nRainwater harvesting, which in our house we use to flush most of our toilets, is another superb opportunity to grasp when building new developments. Permeable surfaces to minimise run-off and water harvesting rob the water companies of their biggest excuse for discharges of foul water into our seas and waterways.\nI believe it is close to criminal to waste the energy nature brings. The house-building lobby have had their way for far too long. They need to be obliged to build to passivhaus standards and provide real value for money for the people who are going to live in them while world energy and clean water supplies continue to be problematic at local, national and global levels.”",

I don’t think anyone can count 2020 as a normal time, but has it affected women disproportionately to men?\nMarch 8th also marks the day schools reopen after three months of online lessons. How has this current lockdown and the pandemic in general affected women’s careers and in particular those of mothers?\nLike many parents, when the government changed the furlough scheme at the end of July I had two choices – work from home around the kids or take redundancy.\nAs a parent of a high needs child with a keyworker partner, there wasn’t a choice. I don’t regret taking redundancy, it’s given me the opportunity to start a brand-new career, but it’s not a situation I’d have chosen.\nThe schools reopened in September, but it didn’t bring as many options as some had hoped.\nKarla, a mother of two who lost her job in July says, “When the schools returned, ours was only open from 9am to 2pm with no breakfast or after school clubs.” This made her attempts to job search trickier than she’d imagined, especially as it was unclear how long these hours would continue. “When I spoke to potential employers they would ask when I was available from and I just couldn’t give them an answer.”\nWhilst employment regulations do cover working parents, they don’t necessarily equip them to communicate uncertainty.\nCeri, a mother of four, had the option of re-applying for her old job when things started to go back to normal. However, “There were three of us who would have applied for two roles. I chose not to because it would be awkward. They knew my situation and how could I know if I could work in the autumn?”\nThis issue meant parents – in practice mostly mothers – who’d left roles earlier in the year were still out of the workforce by the post-Christmas lockdown.\nMany, though, had begun the process of applying for jobs or taking qualifications.\nSome had been lucky enough to start a new role only to find it in jeopardy once the January lockdown arrived. Amanda says, “I was told I was being furloughed over a male colleague due to childcare issues.”\nFurloughing meant Amanda could keep her job in the long run, but was removed from the workforce temporarily as her male counterparts stayed. A good lawyer might have argued indirect discrimination in this instance, but it wasn’t an option for Amanda. “I work in a male environment, so I’m always trying to prove myself,” she says, and of course her children would have still needed looking after.\nFiona, a mother with a special needs child says, “I had to take unpaid leave and juggle things. The usual one to one cover is not happening, nothing is being done at all. All counselling and speech and language help has stopped.” Her child’s needs had to take priority over her job, which meant a significant reduction of income.\nBut what about the mothers who did stay in their roles and continued working from home from around the makeshift classrooms?\nMy work is all freelance now. If I don’t work, I don’t get paid. Weekdays are mostly taken up with childcare, which means I work at weekends when my partner is home to take over from me.\nSarah, who works as a civil servant, has also started working weekends rather than some workdays. Her employer has been incredibly supportive and given them the opportunity to do so. “I’m working 45 hours plus a week,” she says, “but I’m still helping my daughter with her school stuff!”\nI think as parents we’d all agree it’s a sacrifice worth making, and whilst her employer is monitoring the number of hours their team are working, they aren’t monitoring the amount of home-schooling Sarah does on top of this.\nWorking mothers in the past complained of ‘doing it all’ and not having a break, but I don’t think anyone ever expected it to get to this level of burn out!\nElla shares care with the father of her children, but still finds herself shouldering the majority of their home schooling. “Their father doesn’t work Thursdays or Fridays but they’re still with me then while I continue doing a full day of work. Otherwise nothing would get done, he just can’t motivate them and doesn’t have the patience to help with schoolwork.”\nWhilst many fathers do get involved with home learning, as I take another call from the school, I realise sometimes wider society just doesn’t expect this.\nBryony and her husband are both teachers. They’ve both been thrown into the impossible task of teaching their own curriculums and at the same time supporting their children’s learning. Except, as Bryony says, “He teaches from the front room with the door shut. I teach in our open plan downstairs with three children. He does the same job with his own space, I do it whilst juggling/ shouting at the kids. It was never really a decision, just an expectation from both of us I would do this.”\nBryony’s situation isn’t unusual. Her husband is also not a slacker. It’s just become the unspoken expectation. In Ella’s example we saw, it’s often because men don’t feel they have the skillset to do so. But neither do most women.\nWhat we’re expected to do in this lockdown isn’t home school. That in many ways is easier. Instead we’re taking on the role of teaching assistants. But teaching assistants aren’t just unskilled workers who sit in the corner of a classroom and say encouraging things. They’re professionals. They’ve studied the stage of the curriculum they support and have key skills your average ‘thrown in at the deep end parent’ doesn’t.\nSo why are fathers sometimes picking up less of the load here?\nI’ve lost count how many times the schools have called me during this lockdown. But not once has my partner stopped his work to deal with anything the children need.\nThis isn’t because his work is more important than mine, or because he’s uninterruptible. It’s not even because he doesn’t do his fair share. It’s because not once have either of our children’s schools called him. Why?\nIt’s not just a lockdown thing. The schools never call him, and when I’ve asked parent friends they’ve said the same thing. Which means working mothers are taking on more of the burden. Splitting their responsibilities between work and home like this means they have less time to create opportunities to ‘go the extra mile’\nThis isn’t just mildly annoying; it also significantly affects the amount mothers are achieving as opposed to fathers.\nAmira says “My employers have been really good and encourage flexible working, but it feels like I have two jobs to manage. I don’t have the capacity to strive for the next level career wise.”\nWe think of this lockdown as fleeting, and something which will just pass. But the effects on women’s careers might be felt for way longer. What happens when the next promotions or pay reviews come around and women have achieved less than men?\nLike most situations which indirectly affect women, it’s not #allmen and it’s not #allwomen. But it’s enough to cause concern.\nCatherine is the keyworker in her household and as such has had more freedom since the lockdown. She says, “As a nurse leading a Covid study, I’ve been able to prove myself more at work to my bosses because I haven’t had to worry about childcare because my partner is home.”\nAnd it’s not just working mothers who are carrying more responsibility due to the pandemic.\nSandy explains, “When my parents left hospital after contracting Covid, they needed extra help so I care for them now. With no outside services open or available, women have been left to take on extra caring responsibilities and we’ve had little choice about this,”\nOn International Women’s Day, it’s time to consider what we can do to try and mitigate the effects the lockdowns have had on women’s careers.\nBecky Wing, Green Party Councillor for Central Harbour says, “By not fully, fairly and equally including women of all ages in all aspects and at all levels of our society, we are failing to fully realise and benefit from the potential we have within our communities, something which would be a net and positive gain for us all.”\nThe Green Party often leads the way when it comes to calling for social recovery solutions. One of their key messages post-pandemic is the potential positive impact on families and communities of Universal Basic Income.\nOften when I bring up the subject in relation to the emancipation of working mothers, people think this is more likely to keep women in the home. By paying them not to work, many then won’t. The reality is often very different. Whilst some mothers would welcome the opportunity to home school, just as many fathers (or grandparents, or aunts and uncles, or older siblings) are happy to.\nUniversal Basic Income allows more than ‘just’ mothers the ability to take on this role. This ultimately frees those women with children who want to do more than ‘just’ parent.\nI don’t want to sit here on 8th March 2022 and wonder why we did nothing to counteract the disproportionate way the lockdown and pandemic has affected women’s careers. It’s time to start wider discussions and look for interventions.",

The campaign was spearheaded by Becky Wing, Green Councillor for Central Harbour. A huge thanks to all our members and to all members of the public who wrote to the Council insisting on a proper assessment.\nHere’s our full press statement on this issue:\nThanet Green Party welcomes Thanet District Council’s belated acknowledgement that replacing Berths 4/5 at Ramsgate Port will require an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), as Thanet Greens and others have argued since this was first proposed.\nSadly, those in charge refused to listen. When TDC made an application to the Marine Management Organisation for these works, a senior officer went so far as to refuse our Central Harbour Ward Councillor sight of it, although the works were in her own ward. The present muddle and confusion are the result of this lack of communication.\nEnvironmental impact\nWe believe full planning, environmental and marine licence permissions should be undertaken before this development can go ahead. Ramsgate Port is only a few hundred metres from the Pegwell Bay Site of Special Scientific Interest, whose delicate balance must not be disturbed.\nAdditional costs\nWe understand there are fears that the present Berths 4/5 may fail over this winter. Under the notoriously badly-drafted Bretts contract, TDC rather than Bretts is responsible for replacing the Berths. This being the case, we would have expected a business plan for replacement to have been developed long before now, but this does not seem to have been done. As a result, if the Berths are not useable TDC may now have to cover the cost of Brett Aggregates accessing their site by land – something that clearly could have been avoided with forethought. Any additional cost from the current proposed delay is clearly therefore the responsibility of those who should have planned for the replacement in advance and ensured appropriate processes were followed.\nCommunity action\nTDC’s change of heart could not have been achieved without the welcome support of Ramsgate KCC Councillors Constantine and Messenger, certain other concerned TDC and RTC Councillors, and all those members of the local community who wrote to TDC to express their concerns about the proposed development proceeding without an Impact Assessment. We are delighted that so many residents, like us, want appropriate process to be followed so our precious environment is protected.\nCentral Harbour Green Councillor Becky Wing commented:\n“We have been working with the community and cross-Party for a long time now on this issue and are pleased that the need to follow due process is at last being recognised. This is not about stopping development or change anywhere in Thanet, but about ensuring change represents real progress, about doing the right thing for people and the environment, and about ensuring Council-taxpayers’ money is spent wisely. It is about putting people and places first. This is not the end of the community’s struggle to be heard and valued by our District Council but the start.”",

  "https_thanet_greenparty_org_uk_/https_thanet_greenparty_org_uk_2022_03_08_our-statement-on-green-housing/content_100.html": "What we believe\nThanet Greens recognise that we are in a climate and ecological emergency. Every decision we make should contribute to dealing with it.\nMeeting local need:\nWe recognise that we need more homes to meet local need – but our housing policy should centre on meeting this need, not on using house building to stimulate economic growth.\nLocally there is unmet demand for affordable one and two bedroom homes and homes for social rent.\nIn response to the climate emergency, we believe we must provide most of these homes in towns, near to the services required for daily life, employment sites and public transport hubs. Active travel and public transport must become the default option for most journeys.\nWe know that our high streets are changing and that providing more homes in town centres can contribute to their regeneration, as well as making our towns safer, more friendly places, particularly at night.\nChoosing sites for housing:\nProviding new homes does not automatically mean new builds. The first priority should be to put empty and redundant buildings back into use. Thanet has done well within Kent’s No Use Empty scheme, but there are still over 6,000 long-term empty properties in Kent that are ripe for renovation and could provide homes for local people.\nFor these properties to be comfortable to live in now and fit for the future, we need a substantial programme of retrofitting to ensure they are energy efficient and sustainable.\nWe recognise that our empty buildings will not be sufficient to meet all our housing needs, however. Where new building is required, we believe development on brownfield sites should always be prioritised over greenfield sites.\nValuing our assets:\nAgricultural land is a valuable asset. A sustainable society is one that grows food locally. This reduces the energy required to transport food from farm to retailer. Thanet has extensive arable land – but this versatile agricultural land is being sacrificed to housing development.\nAccess to green spaces for everybody is important for physical and mental health.\nThanet’s wealth of blue and green assets makes our region an important area for biodiversity. Planning policies should protect wildlife, enhance biodiversity, and provide nature-based solutions to climate change. Adaptation to climate change should be planned to protect residents from the adverse effects of increasingly frequent heavy rainfall events, rising sea levels, water shortages and heat waves.\nBuilding sustainably:\nWe believe that all new homes should be built in the most ecologically sustainable way possible.\nNew homes should be energy efficient and generate renewable energy, ensuring they are cheap to run, warm to live in and help mitigate climate change.\nThey should be built to last and be adaptable, with accessibility features as standard and ample storage space for buggies, bikes or mobility scooters.\nIf the community infrastructure required to service new residents does not already exist, it must be planned and built alongside new homes. Medical services, schools and public transport must be ready as the new homes become occupied.\nLocal green space, pavements and cycle routes must be included in all plans, and no homes created whose residents can then only leave them by car.\nIncreased road space should not be provided to facilitate house building that pays for the roads to the new houses.\nWorking within the current planning system\nThanet District Council (TDC) adopted a Local Plan in 2020. This plan is currently being reviewed with a view to adding another 4,500 houses and extending it to 2040.\nThe Local Plan consists of:\n- planning policies (e.g. on biodiversity, sustainable design and construction, air quality etc.)\n- a spatial strategy identifying specific sites where development will be permitted.\nIf an up-to-date Local Plan is not in place, it becomes more difficult to control speculative development on sites outside the Local Plan process – so we recognise that the best way to mitigate such threats is to have an adopted Local Plan in place, if possible. However, the Plan must provide for sustainable development appropriate for the current climate and ecological emergency.\nWe believe that, although some current policies have been designed with the Climate Emergency in mind, our policies need to be strengthened and new policies introduced.\nAll Local Authorities have targets for development, which are set by an algorithm mandated by central Government. TDC is required to provide sites for approximately 17,000 extra homes in the current Local Plan review. Almost all are proposed to be built on greenfield sites.\nWe do not agree that this level of development is necessary, sustainable, or desirable. We call on TDC to work with neighbouring authorities to keep such greenfield site development in Thanet to a minimum and to challenge Government housing targets.\nSouthern Water Infrastructure Issues\nThe need for water management became very clear recently. Our coastlines were polluted repeatedly as a result of the inadequacies of Southern Water’s sewage infrastructure.\nNew policies are required to manage rain run-off, treat sewage and supply clean water.\nGreenfield sites can absorb rainfall. We believe that it is vital to preserve and where possible increase tree cover and green spaces in Thanet.\nWe believe that all housing must have grey water technology to capture and store rain for domestic use to reduce rain run offs and demands on clean water supply.\nWe believe that all new housing and roads must include green spaces and tree cover as well as soakaway features that are not reliant on drains to deal with rainfall.\nWhat are Thanet Greens doing to make things better?\nWe have responded to the Local Plan Review with our own proposals and examples from Green-led Councils, reflecting our commitment to develop more ecologically sensitive policies, deliver a fairer supply of affordable homes for local people and provide better quality homes for our residents.\nOur Councillors have called upon the Leader of Thanet District Council to challenge the housing numbers set by the Government’s algorithm, and to ensure that our housing policies prioritise the needs of local residents. They have also proposed establishing a fund to train our contractors in the skills required to retrofit our social housing.\nWe are campaigning to protect and enhance Thanet’s biodiversity, improve air-quality, and encourage active travel. We are fighting proposed bus route closures and challenging unsustainable development in the countryside. On a practical level, we are frequently to be seen out planting trees, maintaining community gardens and helping look after our green spaces for the benefit of all.\nHaving a ‘Green in the room’ changes the conversation and helps galvanise support for more progressive policy decisions across a range of issues, often across party lines.",
