Among the many enjoying the festivities was Dr Neil Shastri-Hurst MP, who joined local families, small businesses, and music lovers for an unforgettable day out.\nFrom sizzling street food to the vibrant beats of local DJs, the event was a shining example of the best of British community life: entrepreneurial spirit, shared celebration, and open, welcoming spaces for all – including our four-legged friends.\nSpeaking after the event, Dr Shastri-Hurst said:\nIt was fantastic to see such a celebration of local enterprise and community energy here in Solihull. Events like this not only showcase our area’s vibrancy but also support the independent traders and producers who are the backbone of our economy. This was localism in action: bringing people together, championing talent, and making our public spaces hubs of shared enjoyment.\nWith a mouth-watering lineup of food vendors, the afternoon was a feast for the senses. Families, friends, and visitors from across the region gathered to experience what has become one of the Midlands’ most loved street food tours.\nAs Dr Shastri-Hurst noted, the success of events like these speaks volumes about what can be achieved when communities are supported, local enterprise is empowered, and pride of place is put front and centre.",

The initiative, in partnership with The Daniel Baird Foundation, will see lifesaving equipment installed at key locations across the constituency, ensuring residents have access to vital tools in moments of critical need.\nSpeaking after completing the challenge, Dr Shastri-Hurst said:\nThis campaign was about taking practical steps to strengthen community safety. We cannot prevent every tragedy, but we can ensure that when emergencies happen, people have the tools they need to respond. These devices will help save lives, and that is something we can all take pride in.\nEvery year, around 100,000 people in the UK die from sudden cardiac arrest, many of them in community settings. When a defibrillator is used within the first three minutes, survival rates can rise to as high as 70%. The West Midlands also continues to face one of the highest rates of knife crime in England and Wales, making the availability of bleed control kits ever more urgent.\nThis latest effort reflects Dr Shastri-Hurst’s broader commitment to public safety. He has previously succeeded in improving access to the weapons surrender bin at Solihull Station, and has advocated for the use of innovative educational programmes, including the use of virtual reality, to help steer young people away from violence and towards positive futures.\n“I have seen, first-hand, the devastating consequences of violent crime,” Dr Shastri-Hurst continued. “But I have also seen the extraordinary impact that swift intervention and community action can have. This campaign is a testament to what we can achieve when we come together, determined to protect and support one another.”\nDr Lynne Baird MBE, The Daniel Baird Foundation, said:\n“We are incredibly grateful to Dr Neil Shastri-Hurst for his outstanding commitment to saving lives across Solihull. His fundraising initiative to provide more defibrillators and bleed control kits will make a real and lasting difference to the safety of the community. At The Daniel Baird Foundation, we commend his dedication to ensuring that life-saving equipment is more readily available when every second counts.”\nThe equipment funded through the campaign will be deployed in the coming weeks, further strengthening emergency preparedness in Solihull West & Shirley.",

The event drew families from across the area and was hailed as a great success by residents and organisers alike.\nSpeaking after the event, Dr Shastri-Hurst MP said:\nIt was a real pleasure to spend Easter Sunday with families in Dickens Heath. The Easter Egg Hunt was a fantastic example of community spirit in action, and I commend the Parish Council for their hard work in bringing it all together. Events like this are vital for strengthening local ties and creating lasting memories for children and parents alike.\nThe Easter Egg Hunt is one of several seasonal events organised throughout the year by Dickens Heath Parish Council, aimed at bringing residents together and fostering a strong sense of community.",

The Independent Schools Council have already challenged this policy in court, arguing it could limit families' choices and disproportionately impact children with SEND.\nCoupled with this, the recent rise in National Insurance contributions (NICs), which increased from 13.8% to 15%, has added further pressures to employers. Simultaneously, the threshold at which an employer starts paying National Insurance has dropped from £9,100 to £5,000, further burdening educational institutions. This policy will inevitably have a knock-on effect on staffing budgets.\nGovernment analysis shows that these policies could result in the closure of over 100 independent schools, risking thousands of children, including those with SEND being forced into an already overstretched state education system.\nDuring Education Questions, Dr Shastri-Hurst challenged the Minister on how these policies align with the Government’s stated ambition toraise school standards.\nIn response, the Minister dismissed the concerns as “scaremongering”, whilst failing to recognise the very real consequences state schools are now facing as Labour’s policies start to take effect.\nDr Shastri-Hurst said:\nLabour’s ideological assault on independent schools will not only limit parental choice but is set to undermine our entire education system. Thousands of children are at risk of being displaced, and state schools, already grappling with immense challenges, will bear the brunt of this misguided policy.",

  "https_www_drneilshastri-hurst_co_uk_/https_www_drneilshastri-hurst_co_uk_myplan/content_2.html": "Neil is making progress with our plan for Solihull West and Shirley.\n1. Securing new investment for our local NHS\nWe need our A&E services back at Solihull Hospital. Neil has welcomed a brand new £45 million investment in Solihull Hospital. This investment funds an elective hub, which will provide six brand new state-of-the-art operating theatres, delivering a range of procedures for Solihull and Birmingham patients, including for those with cancer and orthopaedic conditions.\n2. Tackling crime and keeping our streets safe\nDue to the previous Conservative Government’s national uplift of 20,000 Police Officers, crime has come down in 2023/24 by 10%, and 999 response times cut in the West Midlands.\nMoving forward, Neil wants to see an urgent reduction in knife crime. This is a large concern to my constituents and the West Midlands suffers from high levels of this devastating act of violence. In Solihull, Neil has raised concerns about the frequent incidents of car crime, which needs pressing attention.\n3. Backing our local High Streets\nThe redevelopment of Mell Square is pumping millions of pounds of private investment right into our Town Centre;enhancing our retail and visitor experiences, whilst delivering more homes, which will boost the footfall. This plan incorporates a new Integrated Transport Hub at Solihull Station which will be another major boost to the local economy.\nIn the New Year, Neil is delighted that, BNP Parabis are moving into their new upgraded headquarters in the constituency and expanding to 800 staff.\n4. Delivering affordable homes whilst protecting our green belt\nOur “Brownfield First” approach, where derelict and unused sites are developed first, must continue. Neil is working with local residents, planners, and local councillors to ensure we build sustainable homes without blighting our precious green spaces.\n5. Improving our children's future\nOne of Neil’s first acts as our Member of Parliament was to debate SEND issues in Westminster Hall. Neil is campaigning for the Government to recognise the tremendous efforts of our schools and teachers, who work tirelessly to nurture and educate our children. He wants to ensure no child is left behind, meaning that all children have the support and opportunities to thrive and maximise their potential. Improving SEND provision locally is a real priority for Neil.\n6. Reducing energy bills and tackling climate change\nClimate change is the defining issue of our time. Neil joined the Parliamentary caucus of the Conservative Environment Network, to champion greater environmental action in Parliament. Neil has a plan to work with Solihull Council, and the West Midlands Combined Authority, to retrofit more homes, and seek more support from the Government for local businesses to decarbonise. Neil believes that local businesses can benefit from trade opportunities that will follow a transition to a lower carbon economy. Neil wants household energy bills to fall, that is why he opposed the Government’s cuts to the Winter Fuel Payment.",
