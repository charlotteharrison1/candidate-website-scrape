In total, more than half a million people are currently on the Anthony Nolan register and the average per constituency is 905.\nNow Alison Thewliss is encouraging more 16 to 30-year-olds to sign up. She says it is particularly important that young men and people from ethnic minorities join the register as they are currently under-represented.\nThe blood cancer charity Anthony Nolan created the world’s first stem cell donor register, and has been saving lives for over four decades by matching remarkable people willing to donate their bone marrow or stem cells to patients in desperate need of a transplant. It also carries out pioneering research to increase stem cell transplant success, and supports patients through their transplant journeys.\nTwo thirds of UK patients will not find a matching donor from within their families; instead they turn to Anthony Nolan to find them an unrelated donor.\nAnthony Nolan wants to give people the very best chance of life by finding the best possible match for them. But the charity can currently only find a perfect match for 60 per cent of transplant recipients, so they still urgently need more people to come forward.\nMs Thewliss said:\n“I am delighted that 1379 people in Glasgow Central constituency are registered on the Anthony Nolan stem cell register. It is fantastic to see that there are so many heroic and selfless people in my constituency.\n“I hope that more local people will also now be inspired to sign up and to become potential lifesavers for people in desperate need.”\nAnn O’Leary, Head of Register Development at Anthony Nolan, said:\n‘We are delighted that Alison Thewliss has been inspired to encourage others to sign up as donors. Donating is an incredibly selfless thing to do and will give someone with blood cancer the best possible chance of survival. What many people don’t realise is that it is also surprisingly simple.’\nTo join the Anthony Nolan register you must be 16-30 and in good health. It involves filling out a simple online form and spitting into a tube. About 90% of people who are asked to donate will do so through a process similar to giving blood.\nThe charity needs supporters of all ages to champion the register at a local level and help us spread the word – from schools, communities and workplaces to your own friends and family.

  "http_www_alisonthewliss_scot/http_www_alisonthewliss_scot_questions-on-tampon-tax-fund-transparency/content_167.html": "Alison Thewliss, SNP MP for Glasgow Central, has criticised the UK Government for not transparently advertising tampon tax funding for women’s welfare groups.\nCurrent legislation means that VAT, at 5%, is added to essential women’s sanitary products. The SNP was the only party in 2015 general election campaign to pledge in its manifesto to abolish VAT on women’s sanitary products, also known as the ‘tampon tax’.\nAlison Thewliss first moved amendments to the UK Government’s budget in September, which sought to abolish the tax on ladies’ sanitary products. However, the Government asked for time to negotiate with the European Commission on EU VAT rules.\nIn November 2015, as part of the Autumn Statement, Chancellor George Osborne announced the establishment of a £15 million fund which would be open to bids for women’s welfare groups. The £15 million fund would return to women’s welfare groups the revenue generated from the tampon tax.\nOn 26th November, the day after the Autumn Statement, Thewliss wrote to the Chancellor and welcomed the establishment of the fund but asked how groups would be able to apply for the funding. It took the Government until 4th February 2016 to reply – some 76 days. Applications for the fund closed on 22 February 2016.\nThe Glasgow MP has now uncovered tracking changes on the UK Government’s website, which only informed groups how they could respond 16 days before applications closed – some 69 days after the Chancellor announced the establishment of the fund.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“The fact that it took the Chancellor almost 80 days to respond to a genuine enquiry from a Member of Parliament is shocking and shows gross disrespect to Parliament.\n“None the less, when I received information from the Treasury, I passed it on to women’s welfare groups and encouraged them to apply for the funding. I was gobsmacked last week when we found out that there was such a quick closing date for applications to the fund, despite it taking 69 days for the Government to bother publishing information as to how groups could actually apply. This is simply not good enough.\n“I’ve written to the Treasury demanding to know the exact chronology of events on this. Serious questions need to be asked, such as who was responsible for advertising this funding, what happened between 25 November and 2 February and whether the Government proactively advertised this fund to groups other than a small article hidden away on the gov.uk website\n“It is clear that a number of charities might well have lost out on this opportunity for funding, which is totally unfair. I am therefore calling upon the Government to urgently re-open the application process and properly raise awareness about the tampon tax fund.”",

To watch the UK Government revel in a clear breach of human rights is wicked and shameful.\n“While I do not have any knowledge or information on who may detained or removed, or how these decisions will be made, it is important that my constituents know their rights.\n“If you have received any letters from the Home Office which mention Rwanda, please make sure that you contact your lawyer immediately.\n“If you are asked to attend an immigration appointment, please make sure a friend or relative knows where and when you are going and can call your lawyer if they do not hear from you after 2 hours.\n“If you don’t have someone to do this, the No Evictions Network can also provide someone.

Moving this application to a full hearing will provide an opportunity to further expose the folly of these plans, and highlight the significant misgivings the local community have about this wholly inappropriate development.\n“The wider point to all of this is that our city centre has become entirely saturated with student accommodation. Without a comprehensive student housing strategy in Glasgow, there is no means of establishing the need for this type of accommodation; throwing up endless student blocks in the city centre simply isn’t the answer.”\nAnderston/City SNP councillor Angus Millar, who also lodged an objection to the proposals, added:\n“I am pleased that this application has been knocked back to a planning hearing, and as a local councillor I hope to attend and argue against these proposals, which are overwhelmingly opposed by the community.\n“The Mackintosh Building is a unique part of Glasgow’s cultural heritage and any development must respect and enhance the character of the area – unlike these deeply damaging plans to throw up yet more private student accommodation.”\nWe are delighted that the Council have seen sense, here’s hoping that it’ll be knocked ack by the planning hearing!

Now Ms Thewliss is calling upon the Government to reflect upon how entirely unworkable a rape clause would be and how disastrous implementing a two child policy would be for family finances.\nCommenting after alison-thewliss-mp-response-to-rape-clause-consultation, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“As the Government consultation on the rape clause and two child policy has now closed, I would urge policy officials and Ministers to genuinely listen to the very sincere and evidence based concerns I and many others have submitted.\n“If implemented, we now know the rape clause will almost certainly mean that DWP decision makers – with little or no training – are going to be arbitrating on whether or not a woman was raped and whether or not her third or subsequent child should receive tax credits.\n“Designing a policy and consultation which asks some of the most vulnerable women in society how they would like to prove they were raped must surely be one of the most insensitive, disgusting and degrading ideas ever to emanate from Whitehall.\n“Research by the Resolution Foundation indicates that the two child policy will push an extra 200,000 children, the majority of whose families are already in-work, into child poverty by 2020. These are the very “just about managing” families that the Prime Minister claims to support.\n“Whatever way you look at this, it’s bad policy making, it will be disastrous and the Government must use this consultation response to scrap these awful proposals now.”",

Mr O’Donnell explained that he had been pursuing the PIP claim for several years but was yet to receive any answer on the matter.\nThe constituent asked for a Legal Entitlements and Administrative Practices (LEAP) review as he believed his mobility element may have been miscalculated due to having agoraphobia.\nA letter from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) was sent to confirm that the matter was being investigated and an update would be provided in due course.\nAfter years of patience, Mr O’Donnell was informed by the DWP that he would be given a payment of £9191.41. This payment was calculated using the PIP payments he received and those he is now entitled to for the period 23 March 2016 until 7 June 2022.\nCommenting on his delight at receiving this payment, Michael O’Donnell said:\n“I can’t thank Alison and her team enough for the support they have given me in this case. The patience and dedication shown by the team is something which I am extremely grateful for.\n“I have been trying for years to get this PIP payment but to get it after such a long period of waiting has been such a relief.\n“The amount of money I have received is truly life-changing and will help greatly in the lead up to Christmas.\n“Since getting this money, I have spoken with several friends to urge them to speak with Alison about any issue they have due to how helpful she has been in this process.\n“The process was much easier than I expected, and I will be forever grateful to the team for making sure that I was given this life-changing amount of money.”\nCommenting on this case, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“I am so happy that Michael was able to receive this payment. After approaching our office in June, it was clear he had been waiting a long time for this payment which he was owed.\n“While my team spoke with the DWP, Michael was so patient and understood the issues we faced in this case.\n“I also want to extend a thanks to the DWP, who were also very helpful in this issue and were in regular dialogue with my team about this case.\n“As Michael said, this amount of money will no doubt make a huge difference to his life, and it brings me such great pride to be able to help the constituent in this way.”\nThewliss supports Royal Life Saving Society UK’s Drowning Prevention Week\nLast week, the Royal Life Saving Society UK (RLSS UK), the national charity and leader in lifesaving and lifeguarding training across the UK and Ireland, brought its annual Drowning Prevention Week campaign to Westminster.\nAlison Thewliss came together with the RLSS UK CEO and Charity Director, lifeguards, Olympian Professor Greg Whyte OBE, Paralympian Ellie Robinson MBE, and over 50 other Parliamentarians to discuss the importance of spreading water safety awareness, as well as what practical steps could be taken in Glasgow Central to address the issue.\nAt the event, Thewliss had the chance to see this guidance first-hand, including how to use throw lines, how to respect bodies of water, among other resources and also check out the cutting-edge equipment that is now being used to keep our shorelines and lakes safer than ever.\nThe RLSS UK also showed MPs the charity’s brand-new animation aimed at educating parents and their children about water safety and starting conversations of how their family can enjoy the water safely this summer.\nOver 400 people die every year in the UK and Ireland from accidental drowning, yet every drowning is avoidable. Of those who drown, some 40% had no intention of entering the water in the first place. Yet people should still feel free to enjoy the water, as with the correct education and awareness, this can be done safely.\nDrowning Prevention Week, which began on 18th June and continues until 25th June, encourages the public to be ready to enjoy being in, on, or around water this summer by ensuring that they and their families have a good understanding of water safety.\nLee Heard, Charity Director at RLSS UK said:\n“With June, July, and August proving to be the months with the most fatalities, it is vitally important that everyone understands water safety, especially during the summer months.\n“We want to ensure that everyone can enjoy their summer break and enjoy being in or around water but be safe in the knowledge that they, and their children, have the skills and understanding about water safety, which could potentially save a life.”\n“It is fantastic to have Alison Thewliss supporting our Drowning Prevention Week campaign and highlighting the issues surrounding water safety education and helping to educate communities in Glasgow Central.”\nOlympian Professor Greg Whyte OBE, said:\n“I have been privileged to work with the Royal Life Saving Society UK for many years, as we strive to spread awareness around water safety and help people to enjoy water safely.\n“Every MP who came along to our event, and who helps us spread the message and awareness of this important campaign is helping us reach our ultimate goal of zero water deaths, and for that I am grateful.”\nParalympian Ellie Robinson MBE, said:\n“While swimming ability is of course crucial, far more worrying is the statistic that some 40% of people who drown had no intention of entering the water in the first place. Only by spreading greater awareness of water safety can we help people to enjoy water safely and reduce fatalities.”\nThe event came quickly after the inaugural meeting of the All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) for Water Safety. This took place earlier this month and aims to establish more accessible water safety education across the UK to prevent future drownings.\nDamien Moore MP, Chair of the APPG on Water Safety, said:\n“Every drowning is a tragedy, and despite the RLSS UK’s excellent education campaign having reached an estimated 20 million people across the UK, these horrific accidents continue to happen.\n“It is my sincerest hope that by hosting this event in Parliament, we have helped to further spread awareness of how best to enjoy water safely, so that ultimately lives can be saved.\n“I want to thank the RLSS UK, along with every MP who came along to our event, for the vital work that they are doing in spreading awareness.”\nTHEWLISS DEMANDS IMMEDIATE ACTION ON FOOTBALL INDEX IN PARLIAMENTARY DEBATE\nAlison Thewliss, Shadow Chancellor for the SNP and MP for Glasgow Central, has demanded that the Government takes immediate action on collapsed betting company, Football Index.\nA debate was held today, Tuesday 6th June, on the impact of the collapse of the company, which took place in March of 2021. The company had its licence stripped by the Gambling Commission and was forced to enter administration.\nIt has been estimated that customers collectively have over £90 million in open stakes trapped in the platform following its collapse – leaving average losses of around £3,000 per customer.\nFollowing confirmation that a debate would be taking place on the company, Thewliss has demanded that the time is now to ensure the customers affected by the collapse are compensated for.\nAlison Thewliss MP said:\n“The Government have been tiptoeing around the issue of Football Index for over a year now. Constituents in Glasgow Central have contacted my office and explained the distress they felt, having invested significant money into the company. They now feel completely betrayed by the lack of support following the collapse, and frustrated by the lack of action by regulators.\n“A support package must be put in place for victims of the scandal, particularly given the precedent set by the UK Government on the London Capital and Finance failure. It is entirely unfair that those who continue to have money locked away in the accounts of the now-collapsed firm are being left in the dark.\n“There remains a real worry that scandals such as Football Index could be repeated unless action is taken by the Gambling Commission. The Government must acknowledge the recommendations made by Michael Sheehan QC and implement these as soon as possible.\n“I am deeply disappointed that the Minister didn’t recognise that the Football Index scandal isn’t about people being compensated for gambling losses – it is a clear failure in regulation. On that basis, compensation should be due to those that have lost their life savings to a government-regulated Ponzi scheme.”\nTHEWLISS PLEDGES SUPPORT FOR IMPROVING LIVER HEALTH IN SCOTLAND\nGlasgow Central MP Alison Thewliss demonstrated her support for improving liver health in Scotland by attending the Love Your Liver roadshow, hosted by the British Liver Trust, in Glasgow on Thursday 19th May 2022.\nMs Thewliss is an advocate for the British Liver Trust’s work and recognises the importance of improving early diagnosis of liver disease. She encouraged her constituents and the people of Glasgow to attend the roadshow and find out the steps they can take to improve their liver health.\n90% of liver disease is preventable and if caught at an early stage liver damage can be reversed. However, the alarming reality is that three-quarters of people with cirrhosis are diagnosed when it is too late for effective intervention or treatment.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said: “I am delighted to support the Love Your Liver campaign and the charity’s work to improve early detection. Liver disease is a public health crisis and thousands of Scots are at risk. The Love Your Liver roadshow is a really important campaign, which is helping people better understand the importance of looking after their liver.”\nMembers of the public were encouraged to pop along to the Love Your Liver mobile unit in Argyle street to take a free liver screener, which assesses the potential for liver damage against the three main risk factors of alcohol, obesity and viral hepatitis. A free FibroScan was offered to those who had a potential risk and those with high readings were recommended to speak to their GP.\nScotland has a significant liver disease crisis with around 900 deaths each year. In 2020, it was one of the leading causes of death in Scotland in those under the age of 75. Mortality rates are also four times higher in deprived areas compared to more affluent areas.\nPamela Healy OBE, Chief Executive of British Liver Trust, said: “One in five of us are at risk of liver disease and the numbers of people being diagnosed have been increasing at an alarming rate. Liver damage develops silently with no signs or symptoms and people often don’t realise they have a problem until it is too late. Although the liver is remarkably resilient, if left until symptoms appear, the damage is often irreversible.\n“Our Love Your Liver roadshows are a great opportunity for people to find out their risk of liver disease and receive a free liver scan to see if there is any early damage. Approximately one in five people that are scanned are advised to have further checks.”\nThe British Liver Trust’s Love Your Liver campaign focuses on three simple steps for liver health:\n1. Drink within recommended limits and have three consecutive days off alcohol every week\n2. Cut down on sugar, carbohydrates and fat, and take more exercise\n3. Know the risk factors for viral hepatitis and get tested or vaccinated if at risk\nYou can find out if you are at risk and check your liver health online by doing the online screening test at https://www.britishlivertrust.org.uk/screener\nFor more If you couldn’t attend the events you can still find out if you are at risk and check your liver information on our Roadshows, visit: Love Your Liver Roadshows\nTHEWLISS CALLS ON IMMEDIATE GOVERNMENT ACTION ON PASSPORT WAITING TIMES\nAlison Thewliss, MP for Glasgow Central, has called upon the Government to step in immediately to stop the rising waiting times for passport applications.\nHer Majesty’s Passport Office has warned that applicants for new passports should “be prepared” for significant delays to applications in the coming months.\nThe impact of the pandemic saw over five million people delaying their renewal of passports between 2020 and 2021. With travel returning back to normal, applications for new passports for travellers are now reaching record highs.\nSpeaking on the impact of these delays, Thewliss described how difficult it has been for Glasgow Central constituents to receive their passports after applying for them.\nAlison Thewliss said:\n“Glasgow Central constituents have been contacting me to express their concerns over lengthy delays from the Passport Office – despite applications going in months ago.\n“With a huge backlog of applications to deal with after the pandemic, I completely appreciate how difficult it must be for the workers in these offices to process the requests in a timely manner. I am hopeful that the UK Government will acknowledge the pressure being put on Passport Offices across the country and employ more people to deal with the backlog of cases.\n“I am deeply concerned, however, by accounts from my constituents of being let down and lied to about their applications during a time of stress and uncertainty for them. One constituent in particular, Scott came to me with a list of false information he was given in relation to his passport application.\n“This ranged from being told people could go to collect their passport, which he said was not possible, to being told he would only need to wait 10 weeks to receive his passport, despite eventually waiting 12 weeks to receive it.\n“It is clear that there is immense pressure being put on Passport Offices across the country, but it remains completely unacceptable that my constituents are being given a false sense of hope during a time where they will no doubt be extremely nervous about being able to receive their passport in time.\n“The Government must ensure that the information being provided by Passport Offices is honest and accurate.”",

This demonstrated a blatant ignorance of the dehumanising nature of domestic and sexual abuse.\n“The 2015 budget document suggested that the DWP would develop “protections” for women with more than two children, when that third child was conceived as a result of rape. Despite pressing Lord Freud on this, it was clear the Government don’t really know in practice how such a policy would work.\n“For example, would a woman have to prove that she had conceived a child as a result of rape? If so, who would arbitrate on that? Would that information be retained on her DWP files? If so, would all and any DWP staff be able to access that information?\n“It was suggested by the Government during the meeting that a letter be issued to survivors of rape which they could keep to prove they were exempt from the two child policy and could be presented as and when required. Does the UK Government genuinely think this is appropriate?\n“One question this Government can’t answer is how limiting tax credits to two children per family fits in with its family test for policy. Put simply, this policy is anti-family and will stigmatise children.\n“I’ve already had conversations with faith leaders who believe that this policy would directly discriminate families who, for religious reasons, might have larger families.\n“There are just far too many unanswered questions and concerns around this policy; the Government wrote to me and confirmed that they still hadn’t figured out the detail of how their plans could be implemented.\n“Theresa May’s new Government hasn’t been shy about making policy u-turns and ditching some of David Cameron and George Osborne’s prized policies. The rape clause and two child policy should be next to be thrown onto this new Government’s bonfire and I’m giving Ministers that very opportunity today, when they can come to the chamber and scrap these wicked plans.”",

In March 2016, the UK Government promised to bring forward legislation to scrap the tampon tax by changing the bands at which VAT is applied to tampons and sanitary products.\nHowever, over a year since the UK Government promised new laws to remove VAT on tampons and sanitary products, they remain subject to 5% VAT and no legislation has been brought before Parliament to end the tampon tax.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“I am pleased that the Co-op have joined several other major retailers in paying the cost of the tampon tax for their customers. However, retailers should not need to mitigate the cost of an unjust tax that the UK Government has already promised to scrap.\n“It is appalling that, over a year since the UK Government promised to end the injustice of taxing periods, no draft legislation has been brought to the House of Commons to remove VAT from tampons and sanitary products. This issue has been running on for far too long and too many women are still being taxed for their periods, despite the commitments of some retailers to shield their customers from the tampon tax.\n“The only way to guarantee that all women will benefit from the tampon tax being axed is for new laws to be brought in without further delay. The Chancellor must now come to Parliament with a clear plan and timetable to end this unjust tax once and for all.”",

Mr Jenrick made the claim that no refugees are housed in Scotland, and a further claim that no asylum seekers are housed in Scotland. Given the opportunity to correct this demonstrably false statement on the record, he declined.\nThis conduct is of the utmost seriousness. The UK Government’s ministerial code states: “It is of paramount importance that ministers give accurate and truthful information to parliament, correcting any inadvertent error at the earliest opportunity. Ministers who knowingly mislead parliament will be expected to offer their resignation to the Prime Minister.”\nHome Office data from 2020 to 2021 published last year showed Scotland took in around 13% of all refugees resettled in the UK during that period – well above our proportion of the UK’s population of 8%.\nThe Home Office’s most recent quarterly figures show Glasgow remains the local authority with the most dispersed asylum seekers (70 per 10,000 residents), followed by Birmingham (17 per 10,000), and Hillingdon (18 per 10,000).\nScotland has also taken in 20% of all Ukrainian arrivals under the Homes for Ukrainian scheme and the Scottish Government Super Sponsor scheme.\nFollowing the crisis in Syria in 2015, Scottish local authorities welcomed asylum seekers and by early 2020 there were over 3500 individuals in all 32 of Scotland’s local authority areas, under the Syrian Resettlement programme and the Vulnerable Children’s Resettlement Scheme.\nMr Jenrick’s conduct has not only breached the Ministerial Code, but caused great offence to communities in Scotland.\nThe Scottish Refugee Council were unequivocal in their condemnation of Mr Jenrick’s actions:\n“We are truly shocked by the wild inaccuracies shared here by immigration minister Robert Jenrick. The minister is either knowingly lying or is not aware that Scotland welcomes thousands of people seeking sanctuary each year. We are not sure which is more concerning. With the proposal of the inhumane Illegal Migration Bill and the increase in far-right rhetoric, including from the UK government, it is vital that we call out these blatant falsehoods.”\nI urge you to consider the Minister’s position.",

Solicitors representing those with pleural plaques and asbestosis have said that some requests for employment history schedules to be released are taking up to 14 months.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“When my constituent first contacted me about this, he had already been waiting a year for HMRC to release his employment history. Quite simply, his compensation claim couldn’t progress without this. Unfortunately, it took a letter from me to the Chancellor to get this information finally released, which really shouldn’t be necessary.\n“Figures uncovered using parliamentary questions would suggest that tens of thousands of other people are still waiting for HMRC to get a move on and issue these vital documents. This simply isn’t good enough and the Government must act without delay.”\nThe two MPs have launched an online survey, calling upon those whose claims are still pending to come forward and share their experience. They are also writing to charities and working men’s clubs all across the UK to raise awareness of the campaign.\nIn addition, they have sought a meeting with Treasury Ministers who are responsible for overseeing the department working to progress requests for employment schedules.\nAnne McLaughlin MP, who raised a similar case with the Justice Secretary in the Commons last week, also commented:\n“It is increasingly clear that, for whatever reason, people are being stonewalled by HMRC inefficiency, which means that compensation claims- some of which are time barred – cannot be progressed without an employment history schedule.\n“We have written to Treasury Ministers, asking for an urgent meeting to discuss this backlog.\n“It beggars belief that the Government could set-up the white elephant that was Concentrix to go and proactively hassle folk over tax credits – often needlessly – yet we find out there are tens of thousands of people being held back from getting compensation because another Government department can’t get a move on.\n“I would urge as many people as forward to come forward, take part in our survey and join us in demanding that HMRC gets a move on and allows these people to get on with their lives.”",

She encouraged her constituents and the people of Glasgow to attend the roadshow and find out the steps they can take to improve their liver health.\n90% of liver disease is preventable and if caught at an early stage liver damage can be reversed. However, the alarming reality is that three-quarters of people with cirrhosis are diagnosed when it is too late for effective intervention or treatment.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said: “I am delighted to support the Love Your Liver campaign and the charity’s work to improve early detection. Liver disease is a public health crisis and thousands of Scots are at risk. The Love Your Liver roadshow is a really important campaign, which is helping people better understand the importance of looking after their liver.”\nMembers of the public were encouraged to pop along to the Love Your Liver mobile unit in Argyle street to take a free liver screener, which assesses the potential for liver damage against the three main risk factors of alcohol, obesity and viral hepatitis. A free FibroScan was offered to those who had a potential risk and those with high readings were recommended to speak to their GP.\nScotland has a significant liver disease crisis with around 900 deaths each year. In 2020, it was one of the leading causes of death in Scotland in those under the age of 75. Mortality rates are also four times higher in deprived areas compared to more affluent areas.\nPamela Healy OBE, Chief Executive of British Liver Trust, said: “One in five of us are at risk of liver disease and the numbers of people being diagnosed have been increasing at an alarming rate. Liver damage develops silently with no signs or symptoms and people often don’t realise they have a problem until it is too late. Although the liver is remarkably resilient, if left until symptoms appear, the damage is often irreversible.\n“Our Love Your Liver roadshows are a great opportunity for people to find out their risk of liver disease and receive a free liver scan to see if there is any early damage. Approximately one in five people that are scanned are advised to have further checks.”\nThe British Liver Trust’s Love Your Liver campaign focuses on three simple steps for liver health:\n1. Drink within recommended limits and have three consecutive days off alcohol every week\n2. Cut down on sugar, carbohydrates and fat, and take more exercise\n3. Know the risk factors for viral hepatitis and get tested or vaccinated if at risk\nYou can find out if you are at risk and check your liver health online by doing the online screening test at https://www.britishlivertrust.org.uk/screener\nFor more If you couldn’t attend the events you can still find out if you are at risk and check your liver information on our Roadshows, visit: Love Your Liver Roadshows",

However, it shouldn’t be. It’s treatable and curable, especially if diagnosed early.

Glasgow has one of the lowest uptakes of screening for bowel cancer and I would urge my constituents who are sent a bowel screening test to use it. Taking part in bowel cancer screening is the best way to get diagnosed early. If you are over 50, take the test when you receive it in the post. If you are younger, tell the people over 50 in your life to take the test. Early diagnosis really can save lives.”\nDeborah Alsina, Chief Executive of Bowel Cancer UK, said, “I’d like to thank Alison Thewliss MP for supporting our campaign during Bowel Cancer Awareness Month to raise participation levels for bowel cancer screening.

If you’re registered with a GP and aged 50-74, you will receive a test in the post every two years. You carry out the simple test at home in private and it comes with step by step instructions. The test looks for hidden blood in your poo, which could be an early sign of bowel cancer.",

Analysis by Kantar found that grocery prices were 5.9% higher this month than a year ago – the biggest rise since December 2011 – and that the average food bill could increase by £271 this year. It follows recent figures this month that highlighted that prices are increasing at their fastest rate in decades with inflation rising to 7% – a staggering 30-year high. It comes after the scandal-hit Boris Johnson urged his Cabinet today to promote the UK government’s inadequate measures and to look at ways to tackle the crisis – despite ignoring the SNP’s repeated calls for an Emergency Budget to deliver real support to struggling households. Commenting, the SNP’s Shadow Chancellor Alison Thewliss MP said: “The Tory government is too engulfed in scandal to get on with the day job of tackling the cost-of-living crisis spiralling out of control under its watch. “With new research revealing that people face yet another hit with the average food bill potentially increasing by a staggering £271 this year, families need action not more hot air from this out of touch Tory government. “The reality is that the Prime Minister’s remarks are all talk and no action. “The SNP has been consistently clear that the UK government must deliver an Emergency Budget that finally puts money into people’s pockets. “That Emergency Budget must include at the very minimum converting the £200 energy loan into a more generous grant, scrapping the National Insurance tax hike, reversing the £1040 cuts to Universal Credit, matching the Scottish Child Payment UK-wide, introducing a Real Living Wage to boost incomes, reducing or removing VAT on household energy bills, and following the Scottish Government’s 6% uprating of benefits. “On 5th May, people in Scotland can send a message to Boris Johnson and prioritise action to tackle the cost of living by voting SNP in the local elections.”",

My thoughts are with everyone who has lost a loved one to drugs.\n“This reduction in deaths should serve as a catalyst for even greater efforts to provide assistance and opportunities for recovery to those who need it most. The root causes of substance abuse, such as poverty, homelessness, and lack of access to education and employment have been exacerbated by over a decade of austerity.\n“It is not acceptable for the UK Government to sit on their hands and block efforts to provide harm reduction initiatives such as safe consumption facilities in Glasgow. The Misuse of Drugs Act must be urgently reviewed, as it is a barrier to saving lives and tackling the harms associated with drug use.\n“The stigma associated with drug use not only prevents individuals from seeking help but also causes a cycle of shame and isolation. By treating people who use drugs with compassion and respect, we can create an environment where they feel safe to reach out for support.\n“Recovery communities have made a significant contribution, building a network of grassroots support. The Scottish Government’s public health approach rightly focuses on providing accessible and effective treatment options, harm reduction strategies, and mental health services. Increasing the availability of life-saving Naloxone treatment has saved lives, and I would encourage more people to get trained on how to use it.\n“I firmly support the Scottish Government’s proposals to decriminalise drugs for personal use. We must learn from good practice around the world; nothing should be off the table for tackling this issue which has already cost so many lives and devastated so many families.”",

There are serious questions of transparency and how the Home Office can ever be held to account for what happens to the individuals it sends to Rwanda. But this is just another example of the Government abandoning its responsibility to offer sanctuary and support to those fleeing persecution.\n“My recent visit to Napier Barracks allowed me to see first-hand how profoundly unsuitable and dehumanising such sites are for asylum seekers. The dilapidated former barracks used by the Government to house asylum seekers are inadequate, lacking in facilities and people there struggle to get access to lawyers and adequate healthcare. It is frightening to imagine what a facility located in another country thousands of miles away from scrutiny will be like.\n“I would have hoped that the Tory Government would learn from the comments made after our visit. Yet despite the warnings given to them about the conditions in Napier, the government is proceeding with plans at Linton-on-Ouse. With other members of the APPG, I have repeatedly called for Napier Barracks to close and for the UK government not to open any further similar sites. I reiterate that call today.\n“It is time for the government to get a grip and stop with these tactics to divert the attention away from the chaos within this Government. Thousands of human lives are at risk here, they must be protected. During the worst cost of living crisis to date, the Government should be focusing on allowing all people to have enough money to feed themselves, rather than pandering to the dog whistle politics of the far right.”",

I am hopeful that a formal measurement will force them to take notice.\n“They would do well to follow the steps taken by the Scottish Government who last year set up an independent working group on food poverty, and whose findings are now being built on by the ‘Menu for Change’ partnership – an alliance of charities who have come together to evolve the response to food poverty in Scotland.\n“The local response in Glasgow to the issue of hunger has been admirable – for example, Dalmarnock Primary School hosted a summer club where parents and children could eat a hot meal together during the summer holidays, offering key support for many families struggling to make ends meet.\n“It is a scandal that the UK Government is forcing people into desperate situations, I will continue to challenge their failure to acknowledge the root causes of food poverty.”",

They are a fantastic organisation and I will be wearing my daffodil with pride this March”.\nLinda, who plays Tracey in the hit television show Birds of a Feather, and co-presents ITV’s Loose Women, is a long-time supporter of Marie Curie, having experienced first-hand the vital work of the charity. She said: “Our mum Rita was cared for by Marie Curie and we could never have coped without their constant support and care in her final months. Our family still cannot put into words just how grateful we are.”\n“I’m delighted to be here with Alison Thewliss to help launch the 30th anniversary of the Great Daffodil Appeal – and to thank personally Leonie and Elisabeth for their incredible care and support when we needed them the most.”\nScott Sinclair, Head of Policy and Public Affairs at Marie Curie, said:\n“Having the support of Alison and Linda makes a huge difference to Marie Curie in terms of raising awareness about what we do and helping us to reach more people who need us.\n“We know that seven out of 10 carers say people with a terminal illness don’t get all the care and support they need. We don’t think that’s good enough. That’s why we are asking MPs to commit to ensuring that everyone has the right to palliative care when they need it and help support our annual fundraising appeal.”\n“Our services rely on charitable donations, so I’d like to say a big thank you to everyone who gives a donation and wears a daffodil pin during March.”\nThe money raised from the Great Daffodil Appeal will help Marie Curie Nurses provide care and support to people living with a terminal illness and their loved ones at home and in one of the charity’s nine hospices.”\nTo coincide with the 30th anniversary of the Great Daffodil Appeal, Marie Curie has also published a new report which shows that people living with blood or brain cancer – which together account for around 10% of all cancer deaths annually – are more likely to miss out on care and support focussed on providing relief from symptoms, pain and emotional stress. The report, backed by Bloodwise and the Brain Tumour Charity, argues that all people with cancer should have their palliative care needs assessed when they are first diagnosed.\nFor more information about the Great Daffodil Appeal and to volunteer to collect for Marie Curie, please call 0845 601 3107* or visit mariecurie.org.uk/daffodil.

My experience of dealing with these constituents strengthens my view that the current sanctions regime is unfit for purpose and that it should be halted and reviewed.\nThis afternoon. I took the opportunity to highlight some of the awful situations that some of my constituents have been placed in as a result of the benefit sanctions regime in a Westminster Hall debate. One constituent on Employment Support Allowance, who was suffering from severe depression, was sanctioned for failing to attend a work-related interview, despite his condition making him too ill to attend the interview. Another constituent lost their Jobseeker’s Allowance for over a year after failing to attend an adviser interview – the constituent was not given written notification of the sanction and was not given details of appeal.\nHowever, the most ludicrous example of the failings of the sanctions regime is my constituent on Universal Credit who, having received a form offer of employment, was still expected to adhere to the Claimant Commitment even though he was due to start employment in the next few weeks. This case was featured in today’s edition of The National. This represents the ultimate failing of the DWP’s regime – people who are actually in work are potentially subject to sanction. I will continue to campaign for the existing sanctions regime to be halted and for a full independent review into sanctions to take place without delay.",

Over half of all clubs have already responded and taken up the initiative by declaring their grounds as breastfeeding friendly. Breastfeeding in public places has been a legally protected right in Scotland since 2005, following the introduction of the Breastfeeding, etc. (Scotland) Act by Labour MSP, Elaine Smith.\nSpeaking of her campaign, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“The 2005 Breastfeeding Act specifically makes it an offence to stop a mother or child from breastfeeding in public and that is a hugely welcome protection. What gives further reassurance to breastfeeding mums is for as many places as possible to be pro-active and declare themselves “breastfeeding friendly”.\n“Football crowds have changed a lot over the years and stadiums are becoming a much more family friendly environment. The vast majority of clubs understand the need to build future generations of fans.\n“I’ve been going to Fir Park with my family and supporting Motherwell for over 20 years. Once I became a mum, I took the decision to take my son to the Europa League game against Aalesund when he was a month old. I was a bit nervous about doing so, but was very much supported by my family and neighbouring fans. I’ve had a positive experience at Scotland games too, and I would encourage all clubs to play their part.\n“By making a positive declaration that stadiums are breastfeeding friendly, this will go some way to letting people know that breastfeeding is normal and need not be a taboo issue.\n“With the exception of one or two clubs, the initial response from the majority of Scottish football clubs has been absolutely fantastic and it’s encouraging that so many folk are uniting to make Scottish football a breastfeeding friendly environment”.",

This legislation requires the UK to take measures to prevent violence against women, protect women experiencing violence, and prosecute perpetrators.\nThe Istanbul Convention Parliamentary lobby was an event run by the IC Change campaign, a campaign for ratification of the Istanbul Convention, which raised awareness about the Convention’s importance and where MPs heard from survivors. The campaign aims to secure the ratification of the Istanbul Convention (IC) in the UK.\nResearch states that on average, two women in England and Wales are killed every week by a current or former male partner. In Scotland in 2014/15, 1,797 rapes and 104 attempted rapes and 59,882 incidents of domestic abuse were recorded by the police. In Northern Ireland in 2014-15 there were 2,734 sexual offences recorded, including 737 offences of rape, and 13,426 domestic abuse crimes were reported (approximately 13% of the overall crime in Northern Ireland).\nAlison Thewliss MP said:\n“I am passionate about women’s and girls’ rights and, whilst we are making good progress on tackling violence against women and girls in Scotland, far too many women and girls experience unacceptable violence and intimidation in their day-to-day lives. The SNP has long called for the UK Government to ratify the Istanbul Convention and I urge them to do so without delay.”\nRebecca Bunce, co-director of the IC change campaign, said “This law is about women’s lives. It is easy to forget when talking about legal technicalities, but ratification is really about women being able to live free from violence and free from the fear of violence.”\nShe continued “With the promise of the Istanbul Convention, we have already seen progress from the UK government with legislation on forced marriage, psychological violence and female genital mutilation (FGM). We can’t stop now. With uncertain times ahead it is all the more vital that there is a clear legal framework to help end violence against women. We urge the UK government to finish what they started and ratify the Istanbul Convention.”\nJenn Selby, a journalist, campaigner and survivor who attended the lobby, reflected:\n“When I think of all the brave women I’ve met on my way through the system, how many years we’d all been waiting for court cases that didn’t happen, all the while deprived of our human right to adequate mental support, I wonder how many of them made it.\n“The legal framework did more to see our perpetrators walk free than to keep us alive. This is not justice. Ratifying the Istanbul Convention would end this.\n“Not only would the Istanbul Convention mean a government commitment to the adequate funding of women’s services and a stronger survivor-led prosecution service, but also commitment to prevention programmes – so the violence doesn’t happen in the first place.\n“This is a life or death situation. The Istanbul Convention is the best legislation currently in existence and it will increase our chances of survival significantly.”",

A rescue operation is underway following a Russian missile strike. There are people under the rubble. As of now, 20 people are reported to have been injured and ten killed. My condolences to their close ones.\n“Unfortunately, the death toll may still rise. This would not have happened if Ukraine had received a sufficient number of air defense systems and if the world’s determination to counter Russian terror had been sufficient.\n“Terrorists can only destroy lives if they first intimidate those who can stop terror and save lives.

Minister are now unleashing untold chaos and poverty for some of the most vulnerable women and families in this country – indeed, the very “just about managing” families Theresa May spoke about upon taking office as Prime Minister.\n“As of midnight last night, a two child limit on child tax credits and universal credit – which is tantamount to social engineering – came into force. It largely penalises families who are already in work, so this has very little to do with reducing the welfare bill but is, instead, an ideological attack on the lowest earning families in our society.\n“Independent analysis shows that the two child limit alone will mean a loss of up to £2,800 every year per child for hardworking families. If you had a third child at 11.59pm last night, over the next 18 years you could be £50,000 better off than a family whose third child was born a minute later.\n“Analysis also shows that well over 200,000 children will now move into relative poverty as a result of this deeply flawed two child limit. We should be reducing child poverty, not adding hundreds of thousands more to this miserable statistic.\n“What’s most horrifying is the rape clause, which is a vile policy in total chaos. Ministers are willing to give an exemption to those women whose third child was conceived as a result of rape, but they want them to prove this in a traumatic assessment from healthcare professionals and social workers. This is utterly appalling and will only seek to make rape survivors relive the trauma and brutality of the sexual violence they experienced at the hands of their perpetrator. It must be one of the most inhumane and barbaric policies ever to emanate from Whitehall.\n“The rape clause has been found, even today, as being totally unworkable, with wholly inadequate guidance sneaked out during the night. There has been no proper sexual violence awareness training for healthcare professionals and social workers who’ve been asked to arbitrate on whether a woman’s child was conceived as a result of rape.\n“Ministers have ducked and dived at every turn to try and avoid talking about this policy, presumably because they know it’s so unpalatable. The UK government railroaded this through Parliament using a statutory instrument which meant MPs couldn’t vote upon or debate it. It’s all well and good that the UK government has now conceded that this will need to be referred to a Delegated Legislation Committee when Parliament returns after the Easter recess. However, the fact remains, the policy is now live and will cause untold distress. The UK government must step in today and suspend this right now before serious damage is done.”\nCampaigning MP welcomes Lords’ condemnation of rape clause\nCampaigning MP, Alison Thewliss, has today welcomed the publication of a House of Lords’ Delegated Legislation Committee report which raises serious concerns about the UK Government’s two child policy and rape clause.\nThe Committee has called for the Regulations, which are due to be enacted in under a week, to be examined again by the House of Commons. According to the report, the Committee have “cast doubt as to whether the system will be fully set up by 6 April, when the legislation takes effect, and on whether the exception relating to non-consensual conception can ever be made to work.”\nMembers of the Committee have also rounded on the DWP’s inadequate provision of training for the rape clause third party reporting mechanism, saying that the DWP “takes no account of the training that may be necessary for the assessors eventually chosen.”\nThis shocking criticism highlights the poor preparations that Tory Ministers have put in place for the policy, with no training offered for the hundreds of thousands of nurses, doctors and social workers who will be expected to judge whether or not a woman’s child has been conceived as a result of rape.\nCommenting on the report, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“With just days left until the two child policy and rape clause comes into force, the House of Lords’ Delegated Legislation Committee have highlighted a raft of serious flaws that are embedded within this pernicious and medieval policy.\n“The cruelty of expecting benefit claimants to have to re-live the ordeal of a rape in order to access their benefits to help pay the bills and feed their family is undeniable. This report could not be any clearer – Tory Ministers’ plans for the two child policy and rape clause will not work, forcing vulnerable women to relive the ordeal of rape just to claim a benefit.\n“With time ticking away, Ministers must now wake up to the warnings that the two child policy and rape clause are ill-thought-out and that they will cause unbearable hardship to families. It’s not too late for the UK Government to change tack and ditch this unworkable and medieval policy and I urge Ministers to do so now.”\nRape clause emergency debate application turned down\nSNP MP, Alison Thewliss, has expressed her frustration at the decision of the Speaker of the House of Commons to reject her application for an emergency debate on the UK Government’s proposed rape clause, due to come into force on Thursday 6th April 2017.\nSpeaking from Westminster after invoking Standing Order 24 and calling for an emergency debate – which was rejected – Ms Thewliss said she would not give up the fight to protect vulnerable women and families. Tory Ministers last week quietly used a negative statutory instrument to try and railroad the rape clause onto the statute books without a parliamentary debate or vote.\nThe Government has stated that it will expect nurses, doctors and social workers to act as third party arbitrators. This means that public service workers will have to judge whether or not a child has been conceived as a result of rape, simply in order for a woman to be exempt from the two child policy. Recent parliamentary answers given to Alison Thewliss MP suggest that the over 660,000 nurses, doctors and social workers in the UK have not been given adequate sexual violence awareness training to exercise the exemption.\nCommenting after Mr Speaker rejected her application, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“For 18 months, I’ve pursued this Tory Government relentlessly on its plan to introduce a pernicious two child policy and medieval rape clause. Today’s decision not to allow the emergency debate is incredibly frustrating, but I won’t just give up.\n“In determining that my application did not merit an emergency debate, the Speaker noted that I had tabled an arcane motion of prayer to annul the law – indeed, at the advice of Commons clerks. What the Speaker did not say was that the last time such a motion of prayer worked was in 1979. This is just one example of the many ways in which the procedures of the House of Commons are so arcane, irrelevant and medieval that it fails the people we, as MPs, seek to represent.\n“The clock is ticking; the rape clause is due to come into force in the next couple of weeks but I’ll keep on working to make this Government think again.”\nMP to invoke rare Standing Order for emergency Commons debate\nAn MP will invoke a rarely used Standing Order in the House of Commons today (Monday), with a view to forcing an emergency parliamentary debate on the UK Government’s “chaotic” two child policy and rape clause – due to come into force in just 18 days. Ministers want to limit payment of tax credits two children per family. The Government has designed an exemption to the policy for rape survivors, dubbed ‘the rape clause’, which will mean rape victims will need to prove their child was born as a result of sexual violence in order to qualify for tax credits.\nTory Ministers last week quietly used a negative statutory instrument to try and railroad the rape clause onto the statute books without a parliamentary debate or vote.\nThe Government has stated that it will expect nurses, doctors and social workers to act as third party arbitrators. This means that public service workers will have to judge whether or not a child has been conceived as a result of rape, simply in order for a woman to be exempt from the two child policy.\nAlison Thewliss is today invoking the House of Commons Standing Order 24 in a bid to force the issue onto the floor of the House. She has written to the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, indicating her application for a 3 hour emergency debate. Under the provisions of Standing Order 24, the Speaker will have to make a ruling on Ms Thewliss’ application from the chair today (Monday).\nAlison Thewliss MP said:\n“With just days until this policy comes into force, this Government is about to unleash utter chaos and untold distress in the public service. This will be in addition to the trauma that rape victims will need endure as they recount and relive the brutal sexual violence they experienced.\n“As it currently stands, doctors, nurses and social workers are going to be asking survivors of sexual abuse to prove they were raped in order to receive tax credits. They’ve been given no guidance, no training and no advice as to how this should be done. That is truly frightening.\n“By invoking Standing Order 24 today, I am pleading with the Speaker to grant an emergency debate on the floor of the House, so we can shine a very bright light on the horror that is about to unfold for rape victims.\n“At every turn, this Government has ducked and dived, they’ve used every trick in the book to sneak this policy through without debate. In light of the issue around lack of training and guidance on this serious matter, I am hopeful that the Speaker will grant this urgent debate.”\nGovernment tries to sneak rape clause onto the statute books without vote or debate\nA campaigning MP has accused the UK Government of trying to sneak through its medieval rape clause and pernicious two child policy without a vote or debate.\nLate yesterday afternoon, the UK Government quietly published the statutory instrument – under the negative procedure – which would allow the policy to automatically become law without debate unless there is an objection from either of the Houses of Parliament.\nAlthough Ms Thewliss has now tabled a motion of prayer for annulment, which was signed by a cross-party group of MPs, it is highly unlikely that this would be able to stop the negative procedure, and allow the policy to come into law. The last time such a statutory instrument was annulled by the Commons using a prayer for annulment was in 1979.\nPart of the MP’s concern relates to the lack of training for the hundreds of thousands of healthcare and social work staff the Government intends to use as third party professionals. It is intended that they will judge whether a woman’s third child was born as a result of rape and thereby qualifies for an exemption to the two child policy. With just days until the policy comes into force, there is no evidence of sexual violence training having been given to public sector workers.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“Using such an underhand parliamentary tactic to railroad the rape clause into law is just the final insult this Government could possibly dish out.\n“Not only did Ministers sneak out their shameful consultation response as the eyes of the world were watching Donald Trump’s inauguration, but they’re now trying to put the rape clause on the statute books without a vote or debate, let alone any detailed scrutiny by MPs.\n“The Government must accept this policy is unworkable as well as immoral. With just days until nurses, doctors and social workers are expected to verify whether women had their third child as the result of rape, it’s clear there’s been no sexual violence training for those working with such vulnerable women. This is frankly astonishing, especially when you consider that the Government is trying to railroad this through using medieval parliamentary procedures.\n“This fight isn’t over yet. I’ll do everything in my power to ensure Parliament gets its say on this cruel policy.”\nBudget: Missed opportunity to scrap rape clause\nAlison Thewliss, SNP MP for Glasgow Central, has expressed her “sheer desolation” following the Chancellor’s budget statement today (Wednesday). Despite making his budget statement to Parliament on International Women’s Day, Phillip Hammond MP did not use the budget as an opportunity to scrap the Government’s controversial rape clause and two child policy. The Glasgow MP said today’s “missed opportunity” was an insult to women all across the UK who were celebrating International Women’s Day.\nIn the George Osborne’s budget of July 2015 – and buried within the small print – the UK Government announced plans to restrict tax credit payments to two children per family and force women to provide evidence of exceptional circumstances, such as rape, to claim tax credits for a third child from April 2017.\nCommenting from Westminster after the Chancellor delivered his budget speech to Parliament, Ms Thewliss said:\n“Today’s budget was a real missed opportunity for Phillip Hammond and Theresa May to do the honourable thing and scrap the UK Government’s pernicious two child policy and medieval rape clause.\n“I cannot begin to describe the sheer desolation I felt when I looked at the UK Government’s Red Book today of all days – International Women’s Day – and saw that this callous Chancellor is still intending to make women prove they’ve been raped in order to receive tax credits.\n“I’ve spent over a year and a half campaigning against this appalling policy, and I still cannot believe that any Government would think it’s acceptable to put women and their families through such incredible pain and misery.\n“Although they’ve not yet laid the necessary statutory instrument before Parliament, it’s looking increasingly likely that the UK Government is planning to implement the rape clause on the April 6th. I urge the Tories, even at this late stage, to reconsider their cruel, anti-women policy.”\nUse Budget to scrap the rape clause\nOn the eve of Philip Hammond’s Budget, Alison Thewliss, SNP MP for Glasgow Central, has called on the Chancellor to use this vital opportunity to ditch the UK Government’s planned two child policy and rape clause.\nWith just under a month left until the policy comes into force, the campaigning MP has written to the Treasury, calling upon Chancellor to seize the moment presented by Wednesday’s budget and scrap this pernicious policy, which is opposed by women’s organisations, faith leaders, trade unions, MPs and MSPs from across the political divide.\nMs Thewliss has highlighted the growing concerns regarding delivery of the policy from civil service unions and from respondents to the government’s consultation on this issue. She has also pointed out the Government’s poor preparations for implementing the policy, with no additional training offered for the thousands of healthcare professionals, police officers and social workers who will be tasked with carrying out assessments of vulnerable women and arbitrating on whether or not their circumstances are consistent with rape.\nCommenting prior to the Budget Statement, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“With under a month left until the two child policy and rape clause comes into force, it remains the case that this policy is immoral and unworkable. The public have had their say and they are clear – this policy stigmatises vulnerable women and must be consigned to the Downing Street dustbin.\n“Serious questions remain about the implementation of the policy, with hundreds of thousands of third party professionals left without the promised training in the policy, and growing opposition from civil servants’ unions. The UK Government is still to introduce the necessary legislation to allow the policy to proceed in 23 days’ time, which underlines my belief that Ministers are slowly realising that this policy is a cruel and unfeasible way to cut benefits.\n“With his upcoming budget, the Chancellor has a critical opportunity to save face for this heartless Government and ditch the two child policy and rape clause. I encourage him to do so when he comes before Parliament to deliver his Budget statement.”\nUnder a month until rape clause – Government has no plan in place\nA campaigning MP has reacted with fury in response to a series of written answers to parliamentary questions which show that – with less than a month until the controversial two child policy and rape clause comes into force – the Government is still no further forward in protecting victims of rape.\nAlison Thewliss, the SNP MP who first drew attention to the Government’s ‘barbaric’ proposal, had already forced Ministers into a number of corners – first by sparking a United Nations committee probe into the policy, followed by a climb down by Ministers who had to put the policy out to public consultation, despite originally refusing to do so.\nIn response to the consultation, Ministers indicated it planned to implement a third party professional reporting system, whereby healthcare professionals, counsellors and social workers would be asked by the DWP to arbitrate whether or not a woman’s circumstances were consistent with having been raped.\nThe bombshell answers given to Ms Thewliss by Ministers indicate that no training has yet been provided to the hundreds of thousands of social workers, doctors and nurses who will be responsible for judging whether or not a woman has been raped.\nAlison Thewliss MP said:\n“Over a year and a half ago, I exposed this Government’s barbaric plans to limit tax credits to two children per family and ask survivors of rape – whose child had been conceived as a result of sexual violence – to prove it in order to receive tax credits. Throughout this entire time, it’s been abundantly clear that this policy is immoral and unworkable.\n“Even by the UK Government’s standards, this is a total mess. These plans are due to come into force in just 27 days and hundreds of thousands of third party professionals haven’t had the training in the policy which was promised. This puts these frontline workers in an incredibly difficult position should a woman come forward to present a claim.\n“Any woman making a claim under the rape clause will already have been through unimaginable trauma, and will expect officials to understand the policy and be able to support her. Without training and guidelines, this is impossible; it will only serve to make that woman feel more stigmatised and vulnerable.\n“Other departments in Whitehall are openly distancing themselves from the policy and the UK Government hasn’t even laid the necessary regulations before Parliament which would enable this to happen. This is ridiculous when you consider that it’s due to be implemented in just under a month.\n“I suspect UK Government Ministers know this is an unworkable, cruel, policy which will cause untold pain and stress for rape survivors.

A life threatening and relatively unknown condition, which claims the lives of 44,000 people – including 1,000 children – every year in the UK. The event, hosted by the APPG on Sepsis and the UK Sepsis Trust, was attend by over 40 MPs and Peers, along with a number of patients and their families who have been personally affected by sepsis.\nSepsis is a life-threatening condition that can affect anyone. It arises when the body’s response to an infection damages its own tissues and organs. It can lead to shock, multiple organ failure, and death, especially if it is not recognised early and treated promptly.\nIn a bid to reduce deaths like these, the UK Sepsis Trust (UKST) and the APPG on Sepsis are calling for both the public and healthcare professionals to be more aware of this ‘silent killer’. They are calling for the Department of Health to commit to a public awareness campaign, aimed at both adults and children solely on sepsis.\nThe UK Sepsis Trust, founded in 2010, brings together leading experts, grass roots health professionals, survivors and persons bereaved; to raise public and professional awareness of sepsis, and provide support for those affected by this terrible condition.\nDr Ron Daniels, Chief Executive of the UK Sepsis Trust, said:\n“We hope that the event will allow MPs to learn more about sepsis and take the message back to their colleagues and constituents.”\n“An awareness campaign is something we’ve been calling for a long time. It is an absolute necessity that this campaign is dedicated on sepsis and aimed at a both adults and children. A campaign of course is only a part of what is needed. We need to make sure that healthcare professional education is robust and is mandated. We need to have a better measure of outcomes and we have to have some resources available that reward excellent care.”\nAlison Thewliss MP stated:\n“While sepsis is a condition which may not hit the headlines, it is deadly. It is a little known life threatening illness that claims the lives of 44,000 people in the UK every year, including 1,000 children. If timely interventions proposed by the UK Sepsis Trust were adopted across the NHS it could save up to 12,500 lives a year and the NHS money.”\n“I was keen to show my support for efforts to tackle the disease and save lives. I want to see sepsis viewed as a medical emergency and have a higher profile among medical professionals and the public. The easiest and most of effective way of doing this is the government committing to a dedicated public awareness campaign for the general population.”\nI am still in recovery from\nSepsis and i can honestly say its the worst health scare i have had. Thankfully i knew my own body and knew by day 2 that i was really quite unwell but clueless as to what it was. I attended the out of hours and it all took off from there i was on IV antibiotics for 5 days in hospital, i had to go thru to lumbar punctures, a ct scan and a chest xray, numerous blood tests a day and bags of fluids for dehydration. I went to bed feeling a 100% healthy and woke up really ill thats how quickly it happened. I am just thankful that i went to hospital when i did if i had left it another day or so i might not be here writing this. It has left me fatigued and feeling quite vulnerable. I fully support this",

The judgement ruled that the cap should not apply to single parents with children under two, who would find it “impossible” to obtain exemption from the cap.\nFollowing the announcement of the decision by the High Court, Ms Thewliss is now calling on the Tory Government to drop their appeal to the decision and abolish the benefit cap entirely.\nSpeaking after today’s decision by the court, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“Today’s judgement is yet another damning indictment on the Tories’ cruel and callous approach to reforming social security.\n“It’s clear from the judgement handed down today that the Tories’ reforms are causing untold misery and plunging thousands of hard-working families into poverty. Far from helping those just about managing families that Theresa May is so fond of talking about, it’s clear from today’s judgement that Tory policies are hurting those very people the Prime Minister claims that she wants to help.\n“It’s high time that Theresa May and the Tories recognised the real and serious damage that they are inflicting on families across Scotland. If they are truly serious about helping families that are just about making ends meet, they should honour today’s decision and ditch the unfair restrictions on benefits immediately.”",

The pain, fatigue and lack of mobility caused by arthritis affects every aspect of a person’s life, making everyday tasks such as making a cup of tea, travelling to work or getting out of bed extremely difficult.\nAs well as the personal impact, the cost to NHS Scotland for hip fractures alone exceeds £73 million per year, and these conditions are the cause of one in five working days lost in the UK.\nAlison Thewliss MP, pictured at Arthritis Research UK’s annual Parliamentary reception, has pledged to support Arthritis Research UK’s Prevent, Transform, Cure manifesto in Parliament as an Arthritis Champion, which calls for:\n- Making arthritis and musculoskeletal conditions a public health priority\n- Ensuring people have timely access to health and care services that enable them to improve their musculoskeletal health\n- Ensure people with arthritis and musculoskeletal conditions have fair and timely access to services that support them to be in work, including financial support\n- Protect the UK’s position as a global leader in science and sustain the benefits of the life-science sector to the economy\nSpeaking about becoming an Arthritis Champion, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“I’m proud to champion Arthritis Research UK’s policy calls to tackle the prevention, transformation and cure of arthritis. We need to put the issues affecting people with arthritis at the forefront of Parliament’s agenda.\n“I’m committed to making a difference.

  "http_www_alisonthewliss_scot/https_www_alisonthewliss_scot_page_16/content_757.html": "Alison Thewliss, SNP MP for Glasgow Central, has described planned further cuts to disability benefits as “completely unacceptable” and called for an assurance that disabled people will not be left financially worse off under new proposals from the UK Government.\nThe UK government has announced emergency legislation to change the eligibility criteria for Personal Independence Payment, and overturn the decision of two tribunal rulings against the Department for Work and Pensions last year. The UK Government claims that these changes would reduce spending on disability benefits by £3.7 billion. In reality, the changes will deny over 160,000 people access to Personal Independence Payment, cutting vital support which helps people cope with the extra costs of living with disability.\nThese changes come on the back of the comments made by Tory MP and head of the Number 10 Policy Unit George Freeman, who said that the changes would ensure that benefits went to people who are “really disabled” rather than people “who suffer from anxiety”. Mr Freeman’s comments have drawn criticism from disability rights organisations for the insensitive way that he portrayed sufferers of anxiety.\nCommenting on the legislation, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“For a Tory MP, and one of Theresa May’s most senior advisers, to suggest that people with a mental health condition are not “really disabled” is completely unacceptable and wrong. George Freeman’s words highlight this Tory government’s total lack of understanding or compassion when it comes to providing for those who are less fortunate than others.\n“The Tories said there would be no further cuts to disability support during this parliament, but once again they have shown that the price of their failed austerity project is to be borne by those who are least able to afford it.\n“The UK government must urgently clarify what these new proposals will mean for people who currently receive Personal Independence Payment and give a concrete assurance that any changes will not result in a reduction in financial support for disabled people.\n“I have signed the “prayer” motion laid down in the House of Commons to formally object to this legislation and I call on MPs from across the House of Commons to unite in opposition against these changes.”",

The statement was released shortly after the responses to the Government’s consultation on the closure of the JobCentre were published, which demonstrated significant opposition to the closure proposals. 64% of the responses expressed concerns that local services in Bridgeton would suffer as a result of closing Bridgeton JobCentre and that jobseekers would find it more difficult to make ends meet due to increased travel costs to other JobCentres.\nGlasgow has been targeted disproportionate cuts to DWP offices, with over 50% of the DWP estate, including JobCentres and support offices, earmarked for closure by the UK Government. Local Jobseekers will now need to travel over three miles to attend appointments at Shettleston JobCentre – something that 79% of consultation responses highlighted as a concern in their submissions to the Government’s own consultation.\nThe decision will also put considerable pressure on JobCentre staff – the full extent of which is unclear as Ministers have previously admitted, in responses to written questions tabled by Ms Thewliss, that they do not know how many people currently use Bridgeton JobCentre.\nCommenting on the decision, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“The UK Government’s decision to close Bridgeton JobCentre is yet another slap in the face to the East End of Glasgow. For constituents who are already struggling, paying bus fares to get to mandatory JobCentre appointments will be an extra burden. Increased travel times will also put people at increased risk of falling foul of the Tories’ brutal sanctions regime.\n“Ministers have admitted that they have no idea how many people rely on Bridgeton JobCentre, and not a single Minister visited Bridgeton JobCentre before the decision was taken to close it. Now they have decided to ignore the results of the consultation and sneak out a written statement on the closures, denying MPs an opportunity to hold Ministers to account in Parliament.\n“Today’s callous decision shows that the Tories will continue to treat the people of Glasgow with contempt. I will be making every effort to bring Ministers to the despatch box to account for this poorly thought out and ill-informed decision and explain why they have not listened to the overwhelming evidence presented in their own consultation.”",

This UK Tory Government are doing all they can to try and make this plan seem like it is not, but we all know the truth.\n“As I said in the chamber today, the Rwanda Bill is a turd that can’t be polished. It is a despicable and wicked Bill being introduced as a way for the UK Government to hide from the fact they are incredibly out of their depth. It sickens me to the core that the Tories feel this is how we should treat human beings.\n“Instead of prioritising how quickly they can ship some of the most vulnerable people in the world off to Rwanda, the Tory Government should focus on creating safe and legal routes for people to seek safety here and contribute to our society, and look to support households across the UK with energy and mortgage bills.\n“With Labour and the Tories intent on punishing those seeking safety in the UK instead of helping them, it’s clear that their priorities and values do not align with Scotland’s.\n“That is why it is so important that Scotland continues to have a strong team of SNP MPs at Westminster – to make Scotland’s voice and values heard.

In addition, feedback on my recent Formula Marketing Bill suggests there’s a real lack of impartial information and support available for those bottle feeding and I would welcome views on this.\n“With ever increasing cuts to budgets, it’s been suggested that peer support funding for breastfeeding has been disproportionately slashed, so we’re also keen to look into this more and identify the gaps in service provision.

Raising the price of petrol and diesel just now would be bad for the economy and bad for household budgets. A raid on fuel duty by the Chancellor would squeeze the pockets of Glasgow families – it would put at risk crucial economic growth and job creation. Small businesses in particular have benefited from the freeze on fuel duty and I know that any increase in business costs would also be unwelcome at this difficult time.\n“We know that over 70% of the current fuel price constitutes tax in the form of vehicle duty and VAT. The 5 year freeze on fuel duty has, as of January 2016, saved UK households on average £104 per year.

When I pressed the Minister, it turns out that the Government have consulted just four organisations on a policy which will cause unimaginable pain and distress to victims of rape.\n“This Government clearly does not appreciate that the majority of rapes happen within abusive relationships, and that pushing women to claim could place them and their children in a very dangerous position. During the course of the meeting, Lord Freud suggested that women should “just flee”, without appreciating how incredibly difficult that can be. This comes at the same time when women’s refuges are under threat by Tory cuts to housing benefit. That is simply unacceptable and confirms my worst fears that this is the most uncaring, heartless and cruel UK Government yet.\n“On restricting tax credits to the first two children in a family, Lord Freud made great play of the fact that 85% of families have two or less children, therefore this policy would only impact a small minority of people. He couldn’t answer why the Government is legislating to attack such a small minority. He confirmed that he had not consulted with any religious groups, who may be disproportionately affected by the restriction.\n“I was further appalled to hear that they have no intention of protecting eligibility to tax credits for families composed of children from previous relationships, which further undermines the Government’s much vaunted ‘family test’.\n“I am absolutely gutted by this Tory Government’s lack of compassion, but I will continue the fight to end to this policy.

Shockingly, 25 per cent of people with Parkinson’s are losing some or all of this support as they are moved from Disability Living Allowance to the replacement benefit Personal Independence Payment, leaving people unable to pay for aids and adaptations, energy bills and transport.\nParkinson’s affects 1 in 500 people in Glasgow Central, and can cause a myriad of symptoms including insomnia, depression, and hallucinations, robbing people of their independence. But through more research, improved services, and empowering people with Parkinson’s to take control, their quality of life can be drastically improved. Parkinson’s UK wants to see quality services as standard for the 127,000 people with Parkinson’s in the UK. They also want people with Parkinson’s to feel empowered to take control of their lives, and to take part in clinical trials in their local area to help find better treatments and a cure in years, not decades.\nAfter attending the event, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“I want to help ensure that people in Glasgow Central are not losing out as they are moved to Personal Independence Payment.\n“I look forward to raising this issue nationally to ensure people get the support they need and feel empowered to take control of their life with Parkinson’s.”\nParkinson’s UK Chief Executive Steve Ford said:\n“With 2017 marking such a significant anniversary for us, we wanted to reflect on what we have achieved and what we have yet to do in order to improve the lives of everybody affected by Parkinson’s, but we can’t do this alone.\n“That’s why it’s brilliant Alison Thewliss MP has pledged to help us ensure people with Parkinson’s are getting the financial support they desperately rely on.\n“We look forward to seeing the difference Alison Thewliss MP can make in Glasgow Central, and how she can help us to keep Parkinson’s on the political agenda.”\nFor advice, information and support, visit their website or call their free, confidential helpline on 0808 800 0303.",

Indeed, working families with three children could be up to £2,780 worse off per year under the new rules.\n“In addition, the UK Government is putting women in Northern Ireland in an impossible position given that they, and third party professionals, risk criminalisation if they do not disclose rape to the Police Service of Northern Ireland. Women in Northern Ireland should not be forced to choose between struggling to put food on the table or going through the full process of the criminal justice system.\n“It is welcome that there is such strong agreement from charities and organisations on this issue. I sincerely hope that the weight of consensus will make the government see the error of its ways, and scrap the two child policy and the rape clause.”",
  "http_www_alisonthewliss_scot/http_www_alisonthewliss_scot_call-for-asylum-seekers-to-be-allowed-to-work/content_622.html": "An MP will today (Wednesday) call upon UK Ministers to allow asylum seekers the right to work. Since 2002, a person waiting for their asylum claim to be decided has been prohibited from working. As asylum seekers cannot lawfully work, they often have to rely on Government or charitable support to live.\nLeading a Westminster parliamentary debate, SNP MP Alison Thewliss, will call for the changes to UK immigration rules. This follows the publication of a working paper by Warwick University last month, which shows that allowing asylum seekers to work could save tens of millions of pounds for the UK Government.\nThewliss will also use the debate to speak about asylum cases she has dealt with in her capacity as the MP for Glasgow Central. Her calls for changes in immigration policy today are supported by a coalition of charities and campaigning groups.\nSpeaking in advance of today’s Westminster debate, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“For far too long, under successive Governments, asylum seekers have too often been viewed with scepticism and treated with contempt. Today’s debate is a real opportunity to refocus and remember the origins of the word asylum – that is the protection granted by a state to someone who has left their home country as a political refugee.\n“The increasingly poor treatment of asylum seekers and the removal of the most basic rights is nothing short of degrading and simply adds further misery to those who have fled persecution, war, famine and sexual violence.\n“I know from speaking to some of the asylum seeking constituents I represent that life is made ever more difficult due to the draconian restrictions placed upon them by the UK Government. These restrictions range from the threat of detention, regular and unsettling signing sessions at the Home Office, right through to the ban on working.\n“We know that permitting asylum seekers to work would allow them to integrate better into society, develop their English and make friends in what can often be a lonely and new environment. Many are professionals with skills they would love to put to use. This powerful working paper from Warwick University also sets out the significant savings that the Government could make if it made a fairly modest change to the immigration rules.\n“Another issue I plan to raise in today’s debate relates to the punitive rules the Government has around volunteering and unpaid work.\n“Currently, the Government views certain cases of volunteering as being a sign of ‘bad character’. This fallacy in policy is exemplified by a Christian Pastor in my constituency who was given leave to remain in the UK, and was seeking full British citizenship. However, he was denied that because he did voluntary work for the British Red Cross. This is absolutely ludicrous and I’ll be looking for answers on this from Ministers today.”",

My constituency is home to 3 universities, all producing world-class scientific, technological, mathematical and engineering research, and their work is vitally important for building the industries that will sustain our economy for many years to come.\n“I enjoyed meeting Layla Mir Bruce today and found her work on purifying paracetamol fascinating. I wish her every success in the future.”\nStephen Metcalfe MP, Chair of the Parliamentary & Scientific Committee and Science & Technology Committee said:\n“Today’s event is a two-way process designed to strengthen the dialogue between Parliament and the science and engineering community. Many colleagues in the House of Commons will meet researchers who live and work in their constituencies and will forge links and cultivate their contact in the future.\n“I hope they will be invited to visit laboratories or companies to see research at first hand. I also hope that researchers can increase their awareness of how Parliament deals with science and STEM issues and learn about the political process. Perhaps in future years some will return as Members of Parliament themselves. Both Parliament and Government benefit from having scientific expertise within their ranks.”",

It has received widespread praise for its realistic and empowering portrayal of women and girls, and to date has encouraged more than 2.8 million women to take up more sport or physical activity as a result.\nAlison Thewliss MP met the This Girl Can team in Parliament to mark the launch of the next phase of the National Lottery funded campaign. With a range of new adverts featuring real women and girls playing sport and taking part in activities, from rugby to roller derby to ju-jitsu and mum and baby classes, This Girl Can is proving that no matter what your age, ability or interest is, there is an activity for everyone.\nGlasgow Central MP Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“I’m proud to support the This Girl Can campaign to get more women and girls active. The record numbers of women playing sport show that This Girl Can has really struck a chord but clearly more needs to be done. I am delighted that This Girl Can is showing a variety of sports that can be enjoyed at any stage of life, regardless of age, ability or experience.“",

This is an important commitment, but it only goes a small way to help those in need. There is a need for the international community to do more to commit to support those desperately in need, and also for routes to be established to allow that aid to get in to Gaza. It cannot be right that the Secretary General of the United Nations has had to go to the Rafah crossing and plead for aid trucks to be allowed in.\nI fully support the investigation of all war crimes, and believe that those who have perpetrated such acts must be held to account.\nI am deeply concerned about the continued supply of arms to Israel. This happens in a context where the UK Parliamentary committee which is supposed to scrutinise this – the Joint Committee on Arms Export Controls – has not met this year. I raised this on Tuesday during the Statement on Gaza: https://x.com/alisonthewliss/status/1724438119301149180?s=20\nMy colleague Brendan O’Hara, the SNP’s Foreign Affairs Spokesperson also raised wider concerns over the situation and called again for a ceasefire: https://x.com/theSNP/status/1724458987397980328?s=20",

The last time such a statutory instrument was annulled by the Commons using a prayer for annulment was in 1979.\nPart of the MP’s concern relates to the lack of training for the hundreds of thousands of healthcare and social work staff the Government intends to use as third party professionals. It is intended that they will judge whether a woman’s third child was born as a result of rape and thereby qualifies for an exemption to the two child policy. With just days until the policy comes into force, there is no evidence of sexual violence training having been given to public sector workers.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“Using such an underhand parliamentary tactic to railroad the rape clause into law is just the final insult this Government could possibly dish out.\n“Not only did Ministers sneak out their shameful consultation response as the eyes of the world were watching Donald Trump’s inauguration, but they’re now trying to put the rape clause on the statute books without a vote or debate, let alone any detailed scrutiny by MPs.\n“The Government must accept this policy is unworkable as well as immoral. With just days until nurses, doctors and social workers are expected to verify whether women had their third child as the result of rape, it’s clear there’s been no sexual violence training for those working with such vulnerable women. This is frankly astonishing, especially when you consider that the Government is trying to railroad this through using medieval parliamentary procedures.\n“This fight isn’t over yet.

Bees are responsible for pollinating two thirds of the food we eat. But the National Farmers Union (NFU) has applied to the government to lift the ban in some parts of the country. Ministers are currently considering their application.\nMs Thewliss took the pledge to oppose the lifting of the ban at a Parliamentary event held this week, organised by 38 Degrees and Friends of the Earth. MPs heard new evidence from scientists and from a Lincolnshire farmer who had stopped using these pesticides before the ban.\nSpeaking after the event, Ms Thewliss said:\n“The message is loud and clear from people in Glasgow Central – keep the ban on bee harming pesticides. I have listened to their concerns and I’ll be making my opposition very clear in parliament to any plan to lift the ban.”\nAmy Lockwood, Campaign Manager at 38 Degrees, said:\n“38 Degrees members have come together – in our hundreds of thousands – to send a clear message to the government: the British people don’t want the ban on bee killing pesticides to be lifted.”\nSandra Bell, The Bee Cause campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said:\n“Bees are essential for pollinating our crops – we can’t afford to gamble with their future.

In 2015 for example, there was 47 new diagnoses of HIV compared to an annual average of 10, for those who are injecting drugs. Indeed, there is thought to be around 500 people who regularly inject drugs in public places in Glasgow City Centre alone.\n“I can attest to the fact that Glasgow has a growing problem with respect to public injecting; my constituency office often receives reports of needles and other drug paraphernalia being discarded in public places. In addition, I have seen for myself public injecting taking place in locations not far from where my office is located.\n“It’s clear to me that the drug injecting population in Glasgow face a number of different barriers in accessing health services which can help them with their addiction, and that current methods are falling short of offering the appropriate level of support. For this reason, Glasgow City Health and Social Care Partnership, and other parties, have developed innovative plans for the implementation of a Safe Injecting Facility.\n“It is imperative that the Home Office consider this request – which has cross-party support from a number of Scottish MPs – to allow an SDCF to be trialled in Glasgow. This issue has become a serious public health issue, and it is our collective responsibility to ensure that we do what we can to improve the situation not just for drug users, but for the wider public in general”.",

So much of this work goes totally unrecognised and happens under the radar, but it is vital in supporting vulnerable women in Glasgow from all kinds of backgrounds.\n“Getting the opportunity to spend some time with the staff at the centre this week was hugely valuable in terms of getting an insight into the complex challenges they face in supporting women through unimaginably horrific situations.\n“It’s a bittersweet moment to celebrate forty years of an organisation that shouldn’t have to exist in this day and age. However, the figures show that too many rapes still go unreported and the conviction rate is still far, far too low. We need to remember that, although the majority – 97% – of rape cases don’t result in conviction, it’s still absolutely imperative the survivors of rape and sexual abuse are given sensitive and confidential support as they try to rebuild their lives.\n“The work that Rape Crisis staff and volunteers do from their Support to Report project right down to their first response helpline is absolutely vital, and I very much look forward to taking forward a number of issues they raised with me to day which I, in turn, will be taking up with the Scottish and UK Governments.”",

That they wanted this callous policy to be buried speaks volumes in itself.\n“Women across the world have been marching this weekend in solidarity with America, whilst here in the UK, the Westminster Government ploughs ahead to undermine women’s rights.\n“Obviously I am pleased that the UK Government has made a number of concessions, which will go some way to reducing some of the cruellest aspects associated with this pernicious proposal.\n“I particularly welcome the u-turn on multiple births and that there will be no time limit on the reporting of rape. What is also encouraging is the decision to remove frontline DWP and HMRC staff from gatekeeping on this incredibly sensitive process. However, there are still fundamental problems with this pernicious two-child policy, not least concerning those of faith and ethnic minority backgrounds.\n“The UK Government’s own response clearly identifies that the most controversial aspect of the policy was the rape clause. Ministers even go on to concede that most respondents felt it was unacceptable for the UK Government to ask women to re-live the ordeal of a rape just in order to make a claim for benefit. Despite receiving that loud and overwhelming message, this appalling and crass Tory Government refuse to listen.\n“The fact remains that this policy, however diluted, is still anti-women, anti-family and fundamentally wicked.\n“There are still a number of very serious unanswered questions about the practicalities of a policy due to be implemented in just a few months’ time. I’ll be using this crucial time to fight these proposals all the way, particularly when they come to the House as a statutory instrument.”",

Indeed, End Child Poverty have called for an immediate cessation of the freeze on social security benefits, which has been in effect since 2016.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“The UK Government’s record on the issue of child poverty is appalling. This is a government who scrapped statutory income-based child poverty targets; clearly demonstrating how low down the issue is on their list of priorities.\n“The benefit cap continues to squeeze those who rely most on support, and in Glasgow the statistics make for grim reading – there are 636 households, and over 1,936 children directly affected. Not only that, according to a report published by Sheffield Hallam University, support for claimants in Glasgow, as a result of post-2015 welfare reforms, is anticipated to fall by an average of £420 per year.\n“Moreover, the UK Government’s two child limit ensures that Child Tax Credit claims – including the child element of Universal Credit – are restricted to the first two children in a family. This is tantamount to social engineering, and will mean a loss of up to £2,800 every year per child for countless families. This cut is so severe that the Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG) have estimated that it will plunge a further 200,000 children into poverty.\n“The Scottish Government is doing what it can to stem the flow of Tory cuts; already it has mitigated the devastating effects of the Bedroom Tax through discretionary housing payments, and moved to ensure that a reduction in Council Tax Support was not passed on to claimants in Scotland. It is unsustainable however to expect the Scottish taxpayer to continue to bear the financial brunt of Tory malevolence.\n“This austerity-obsessed government seems not to care about the plight of ordinary people, including the wellbeing of children. Brexit is on the horizon, bringing with it rising prices – the outlook is indeed bleak. Whilst the Scottish Government is committed to doing what it can to improve the situation, it requires full control over economic levers in order that child poverty can be properly addressed in a meaningful and responsible way”.",

This is not a debate about breastfeeding versus formula milk.\n“I believe it is vitally important that parents get accurate and impartial information on the contents of formula milk and the best way to prepare it safely. At present there is a worrying lack of independent scrutiny of infant and young child formula, as well as growing frustration about the industry marketing tricks and misleading claims being pushed on parents and health professionals alike.\n“Misinformation on health policy never ends well and this Bill aims to seriously tighten up the behaviour of the formula industry.\n“I look forward to using the coming months to consult on the contents of the Bill. I will continue working with MPs across the House to convince the Government that this should be put on the statute books to safeguard the health and wellbeing of babies and young children.”\nAnything that helps!

There are 6.5 million people in the UK who care for a partner, relative or friend, of which 6324 carers are in Glasgow Central.\nThe seven charities driving Carers Week 2016 are calling on individuals, organisations and services throughout the country to improve the lives of carers by building ‘Carer Friendly Communities’ – encouraging all parts of the community to think about carers and do things differently to support them.\nThe call comes after research for Carers Week revealed that a combination of inadequate support from local services and a lack of understanding about caring from wider society is having a negative impact on carers’ health, wellbeing, relationships and finances.\nGlasgow Central MP Alison Thewliss said:\n“Carers make a huge contribution to our society, providing vital and often hidden support to friends and family members. That is why I am supporting Carers Week 2016 and encouraging services across Glasgow Central to think about what more they can do to help meet the needs of carers and make our communities more Carer Friendly.”\nEmily Holzhausen, who leads the Carers Week partnership, said:\n“With an ever increasing number of families taking on caring roles for older, ill or disabled loved ones, it is great to see MPs showing their support for carers.\nWhile carers have told us that it makes a huge difference when they are recognised and supported by their local services and communities, too many carers tell us they struggling to balance caring with other areas of their lives. By working together during Carers Week we have a huge opportunity to make our communities more Carer Friendly and make a difference to those who contribute so much”.\nCarers Week is made possible by Carers UK joining forces with Age UK, Carers Trust, Independent Age, Macmillan Cancer Support, Motor Neurone Disease Association and MS Society.\nThousands of events are taking place across the country this week, and thousands of people have already pledged their support for carers online.

MPs from six different parties signed this pledge, representing the widespread concern of parliamentarians on this issue. Around 180,000 EU nationals are currently resident in Scotland and make a highly important contribution to Scottish society.\nI believe workers from across Europe play a vital role in our public services, especially in the NHS where in Scotland 5% of the overall NHS workforce are EU nationals. Many of these people are long existing residents of Scotland and the UK, they and their families deserve better than years of uncertainty and being reduced to bargaining chips in the upcoming negotiations.\nThe Government must reconsider their stance on this important issue and unilaterally grants the Right to Remain for EU citizens before the process of Brexit negotiations begins.",
  "http_www_alisonthewliss_scot/https_www_alisonthewliss_scot_author_athewlissmp_page_6/content_715.html": "Alison Thewliss, MP for Glasgow Central, has lent their support to a campaign from leading charity Diabetes UK, calling for the public to be given clear nutritional information in restaurants, cafes and takeaways, as well as on the front of all pre-packaged food and drinks.\nMs Thewliss made the pledge at a parliamentary event hosted by the charity as part of its ongoing Food Upfront campaign. Through the campaign, Diabetes UK is making the following calls to government:\n- Mandatory front-of-pack traffic light labelling on all pre-packed foods and drinks sold in the UK,\n- Mandatory calorie labelling on menus in key high street restaurants, cafes and takeaways, with carb content available online or when you ask for it in store,\n- Ensure carbohydrates are labelled on the back of products, per portion and as prepared.\nClear food labelling is vital for millions of people living with diabetes, to help them manage their condition and reduce their risk of serious complications. In a 2017 survey of more than 9,000 people living with or affected by diabetes, almost three quarters of respondents (73%) said that if all companies used the same food labelling system it would help them to make healthier choices.\nClear food labelling also helps the wider public, with or without diabetes, make more informed decisions about what they eat and drink. Recent public polling carried out by ComRes on behalf of\nDiabetes UK revealed that 9 out of 10 people said traffic-light food labelling helps them make healthier decisions, while only three in ten people (29%) said they felt they had enough information about what’s in their food.\nIn addition, more than three quarters of people (76%) said that cafes, restaurants and takeaways should display calorie information on their menus, so that customers understand the content of the food and drink they buy.\nTraffic-light labelling assigns a red, amber or green value in relation to fat, saturated fat, sugar and salt, as well as giving information on the calories in a product, to help consumers find out what’s in the food and drink they’re buying. Evidence shows that both front-of-pack traffic light labelling and calorie labelling informs consumers and helps making the healthier choice the easier choice.\nHowever, clear and consistent food labelling is not currently compulsory. Companies don’t have to provide any information on the front of their goods, and one in three products in shops don’t have clear traffic-light labels. Many restaurants, cafes and takeaways also still do not provide calorie labelling on their menus or other nutritional information online or when asked for it in store.\nCommenting on the campaign, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“The public have made it clear that they support clearer labelling on food and drink to help them make healthier and better informed decisions about what they eat, so I’m happy to lend my support to Diabetes UK’s Food Upfront campaign.\n“Putting these simple measures into place could make a huge difference to the nation as a whole. Obesity and weight related chronic health conditions – including Type 2 diabetes – continue to rise, and it’s important that we do everything that we can to halt this growing health crisis.”\nHelen Dickens, Assistant Director of Campaigns and Mobilisation at Diabetes UK, said:\n“We know that consistent and clear food labelling can help all of us to make informed choices. For people with diabetes, easy access to clear and consistent labelling, for example on carbohydrate content, is vital to supporting them with their diabetes management.\n“With around two-thirds of adults, and almost a third of children in the UK classed as overweight or obese, and therefore at increased risk of Type 2 diabetes and other chronic health conditions, it’s really important that we have measures in place that help make it easier for all of us to know what’s in the food we’re buying.\n“That’s why we are calling for the government to strengthen and, when possible, introduce mandatory front of pack traffic-light labelling on packaging, and calorie labelling on menus. The British public overwhelmingly support these moves, so we are grateful to Alison Thewliss MP for her efforts in helping put these potentially life-changing measures into practice.”",

She found out that, in Glasgow Central constituency, 6800 people are diagnosed with cancer each year, underlining the need for MPs to join the fight against the disease.\nCommenting after the event, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“We must not underestimate the devastating impact cancer will have on people in Glasgow now and in the future, so it gives me hope to hear that Cancer Research UK’s pioneering research is turning the tables on the disease.\n“The outlook for new and better cancer treatments in the UK is bright. However, it is clear that there is a critical role for politicians to play in helping to prevent and detect cancer earlier and bring innovative new treatments to patients faster.\n“One life lost to this terrible disease is one too many and that’s why I’m supporting Cancer Research UK in their mission to beat cancer sooner.”\nMatt Davies, Cancer Research UK’s Head of Public Affairs and Campaigning said:\n“At Cancer Research UK, we’re resolute in our ambition to see 3 in 4 patients surviving cancer by 2034. To achieve this we need cancer at the top of the political agenda and so we’re grateful to (insert name) MP for helping to highlight the importance of research and action in beating the disease.\n“Survival in the UK has doubled in the last 40 years. But there’s still so much more to do and we cannot do it alone.\n“Creating the right environment for cancer research alongside cancer prevention, early diagnosis and ensuring patients have access to the best possible treatments must be key priorities for the new Government.”",

The rule change now means child tax credits and universal credit claims are restricted to the first two children in a family.\nIn addition, the policy also requires tax credit claimants, whose third or subsequent child was conceived as a result of rape, to prove this to social workers and health professionals in order to qualify for an exemption – a move that has been categorically denounced by faith leaders, women’s welfare groups, trade unions and child poverty campaigners alike.\nAlison Thewliss MP – who first exposed the policy – said:\n“I welcome the work that the Child Poverty Action Group have done to put pressure on the UK Government, following the introduction of the callous and heartless two child policy earlier this year.\n“The sad truth is, independent analysis shows that in excess of 200,000 children will move into relative poverty as a result of the two child policy. Indeed, those families who now choose to have a third child could be £50,000 worse off under these new rules than they might have been previously.\n“Forcing women whose third child was conceived as a result of rape to relive their past trauma, simply in order to make a claim for benefit, is an appalling way to treat women and it’s hardly surprising that ministers have done everything in their power to avoid being drawn into discussion on this issue.\n“With the prospect of a judicial review on the horizon, I will continue to urge the UK Government to scrap the two child policy and rape clause altogether”.\nscrap the child\npolicy and rape clause",

Raising the price of petrol and diesel just now would be bad for the economy and bad for household budgets. A raid on fuel duty by the Chancellor would squeeze the pockets of Glasgow families – it would put at risk crucial economic growth and job creation. Small businesses in particular have benefited from the freeze on fuel duty and I know that any increase in business costs would also be unwelcome at this difficult time.\n“We know that over 70% of the current fuel price constitutes tax in the form of vehicle duty and VAT. The 5 year freeze on fuel duty has, as of January 2016, saved UK households on average £104 per year. Things like the freeze on fuel duty, as well as the SNP Government’s council tax freeze, have helped alleviate pressure on family budgets but we know that economic recovery is still fragile and that can’t be put at risk by a hike in fuel duty.\n“I am therefore calling upon the Chancellor to give Glaswegians good news on Wednesday and continue the fuel duty freeze.”",

Adding to this miserable situation, Yemen is now at risk of famine.\n“The in-country aid workers I spoke to recently told me some really horrific stories about their work in the Yemen. Workers being stopped at checkpoints are being exposed to serious risk, and indiscriminate bombing is severely limiting the action NGOs and aid workers can safely take to meet the growing humanitarian need.\n“I am grateful to the Minister for undertaking to raise these concerns later this week when he visits Saudi Arabia.\n“We cannot stand back any longer whilst Yemen is in such severe crisis”.",

I am hopeful that the UK Government will acknowledge the pressure being put on Passport Offices across the country and employ more people to deal with the backlog of cases.\n“I am deeply concerned, however, by accounts from my constituents of being let down and lied to about their applications during a time of stress and uncertainty for them. One constituent in particular, Scott came to me with a list of false information he was given in relation to his passport application.\n“This ranged from being told people could go to collect their passport, which he said was not possible, to being told he would only need to wait 10 weeks to receive his passport, despite eventually waiting 12 weeks to receive it.\n“It is clear that there is immense pressure being put on Passport Offices across the country, but it remains completely unacceptable that my constituents are being given a false sense of hope during a time where they will no doubt be extremely nervous about being able to receive their passport in time.\n“The Government must ensure that the information being provided by Passport Offices is honest and accurate.”",

Despite making his budget statement to Parliament on International Women’s Day, Phillip Hammond MP did not use the budget as an opportunity to scrap the Government’s controversial rape clause and two child policy. The Glasgow MP said today’s “missed opportunity” was an insult to women all across the UK who were celebrating International Women’s Day.\nIn the George Osborne’s budget of July 2015 – and buried within the small print – the UK Government announced plans to restrict tax credit payments to two children per family and force women to provide evidence of exceptional circumstances, such as rape, to claim tax credits for a third child from April 2017.\nCommenting from Westminster after the Chancellor delivered his budget speech to Parliament, Ms Thewliss said:\n“Today’s budget was a real missed opportunity for Phillip Hammond and Theresa May to do the honourable thing and scrap the UK Government’s pernicious two child policy and medieval rape clause.\n“I cannot begin to describe the sheer desolation I felt when I looked at the UK Government’s Red Book today of all days – International Women’s Day – and saw that this callous Chancellor is still intending to make women prove they’ve been raped in order to receive tax credits.\n“I’ve spent over a year and a half campaigning against this appalling policy, and I still cannot believe that any Government would think it’s acceptable to put women and their families through such incredible pain and misery.\n“Although they’ve not yet laid the necessary statutory instrument before Parliament, it’s looking increasingly likely that the UK Government is planning to implement the rape clause on the April 6th.

This is a real inspiration to many young people.\n“It’s also great to see the Scottish Government doing its bit to support basketball at a grassroots level. The CashBack for communities programme recently awarded £492,800 to Basketball Scotland, allowing them to deliver 16 basketball school projects over a three-year period in some of the most deprived areas of Scotland. This speaks to the broad appeal that the sport is continuing to develop – something that I’m desperate to see continue.\n“Like many others, I’ve been extremely concerned by recent reports that basketball in the UK is facing a funding shortfall of almost £1m. With the Commonwealth Games due to start in only a matter of weeks, it’s crucial that the UK Government do the right thing to secure not only the future funding for the sport, but the places of the Scottish and England teams who have done so well to qualify”.",

The report speaks to the fact that the basic costs of food, housing and utility bills continue to rise, and benefits are failing to keep pace.\n“The number of foodbank referrals as a result of a reduction in benefit, or due to delays when moving to a new benefit such as Universal Credit, have seen a dramatic upturn. Similarly, the Trussell Trust commented that foodbank projects in Universal Credit rollout areas have experienced an average increase of 52% in the preceding 12 months, with many citing issues when transitioning to the new benefit.\n“We already know about the squeeze being put on families as a result of the benefit cap, and the damaging consequences of the two-child limit and rape clause, now there is real and demonstrable evidence elucidating a clear link between changes to welfare and increased use of foodbanks.\n“It is incumbent on Ministers not to ignore the burden of evidence that has been presented on increasedfoodbank use.

Inflation has tripled since the UK Spending Review, where benefits and tax credits were set to be uprated by 3.1% in April this year – it’s now running at 9.1%. The Spending Review also predicted that inflation would peak at 4.4% in Q2 2022, which is less than half of the current rate. A real-terms cut to the Scottish government budget of 5.2% this year will impact Scotland’s recovery from the pandemic and put further pressure on services and public sector wages. Commenting, Alison Thewliss MP said: “The UK Tory Government continue to exacerbate the pain felt by people across the country as inflation worsens by cutting budgets to devolved governments. “Inflation is a global problem but the Chancellor is presiding over the highest inflation rate in the G7. “Allowing real-terms cuts to go ahead means further pressure on public sector wages and vital services for those in need. “It comes at the worst possible time for people struggling with the cost-of-living crisis. “Independent countries across the world are introducing measures to ease the burden on the public. Ireland has reduced public transport fares to help people save on ticket and petrol prices. “These measures are funded by borrowing. Scotland does not have the ability to help in this way because of the devolved funding arrangements. “The Scottish Government has done all it can with its fixed budget – uprating the Scottish Child Payment, making public transport free for under-22s, and expanding energy efficiency schemes to cut energy bills – but providing further support requires having control of more finance levers. “If Rishi Sunak refuses to mitigate cuts to the Scottish Government’s budget, he should support giving the devolved parliament the borrowing powers to do so itself.”",
  "http_www_alisonthewliss_scot/https_www_alisonthewliss_scot_bill-published-to-crack-down-on-formula-milk-promotion/content_105.html": "A new Bill has been published today (Tuesday 21st February) which will tackle the “excessive and misleading marketing techniques” deployed by infant formula milk companies.\nThe proposed law, which is due for second reading in Parliament later this week, has been welcomed by health professionals, parents and campaigning groups – including Unicef Baby Friendly.\nThe new legislation, drafted by Glasgow Central MP Alison Thewliss, will:\n– Introduce plain packaging for all formula milks;\n– Establish a body, totally independent of industry, to test all products and verify the claims of manufacturers prior to them being licensed for sale;\n– Ban the use of misleading terms such as “follow-on” or “growing-up” formula milks;\n– Stop companies from circumventing existing laws by introducing a ban on identical packaging for stage two and subsequent products;\n– Prohibit formula companies from advertising in health journals and magazines;\n– Bring forward tougher penalties for companies who flout the legislation, including greater financial fines and prison sentences for company CEOs;\n– Ban advertising of formula milks on TV, social media, the internet and through parenting clubs.\nAlison Thewliss MP – who chairs the UK Parliament’s All Party Parliamentary Group on Infant Feeding & Inequalities – said:\n“The Bill I have published today is a major step forward in tackling the excessive and misleading marketing techniques deployed by formula milk companies.\n“For too long, these enormously powerful multi-nationals have been pushing the boundaries and circumventing existing legislation to relentlessly promote their products to parents and families. The more we see new aggressive marketing techniques, the more we see ever higher prices for formula milk, which is borne by the consumer.\n“I absolutely understand and respect that some families will choose to use formula milk; this is absolutely not about breastfeeding versus bottle feeding. I want to make sure parents are protected from misleading advertising and can access impartial, trusted information when making feeding decisions for their children. The consultation I carried out demonstrated that many parents are making decisions based on marketing alone, which is deeply worrying.\n“There have been examples of products being recalled or discontinued after they make it to the shelves, for example for being found to have excessive protein. Other concerns include the introduction of prebiotics, which may not be necessary. Without an independent agency to test these products and verify the claims being made by companies, we have a situation of self-policing which simply isn’t working.\n“Under the current arrangement, formula companies are also banned from advertising formula milks for new babies but they simply get around this by branding their products almost identically, with packaging showing stages 1, 2, 3. “Follow-on” or “growing up” milks look the same as their baby milks, so parents are led to assume there is a progression. The reality is that there is generally no need for formula after the age of one. This loophole is costing families dear, with most formulas costing around £10 per packet.\n“For too long, formula companies have been running roughshod over the 2007 legislation which is no longer fit for purpose. In addition, the consumer has been picking up the cost for an ever increasing marketing war – this Bill will go some way to ending this and ensuring that parents are free from commercial influence and pressure when making choices about how they feed their children”.\nThank you!\nI am one part of a blogging team from Glasgow called frankaboutfeeding.com\nOur aim is to support women to achieve their feeding goals. We both have turned to formula when breastfeeding has failed. We both feel that as a nation we should be focusing on helping women with feeding, with particular attention in the postpartum period. If women achieved their feeding goals then the formula industry would naturally shrink, baring in mind that 80% of women choose to breastfeed but currently only 30% are doing so at 6 months.\nThat said, I agree with most of the points raised by your bill. In particular, establishing an independent body to test products. The only thing that I find uncomfortable is making packaging plain. Too often formula mum’s are compared to smokers. We have many women who have contacted us to tell us of the guilt they have in formula feeding (remember we are talking mainly about a cohort of women who have failed at their first steps into motherhood). Yes remove any false or misleading information but don’t make women feel they are poisoning their babies. This is such an error.\nPlain packaging is neutral in terms of marketing, marketing is very clever and subtle ….it has no place in providing informed, unbiased decision making…women should not be influenced by marketing in choosing feeding for their babies.\nPerhaps you are correct, but if we apply this then ALL children’s food should be in plain packaging. This would remove any issues of stigma with formula and perhaps would tackle advertising of sweet treats etc at children.\nThis is brilliant. Well done!\nThis is fabulous – well done!\nReally good interview on BBC, well handled comments from the mum blogger and presenters. Good to see formula discussed with minimal reference to breastfeeding. The formula companies do influence parents. Totally agree that firm regulation of artificial milk and its “benefits” need to be regulated\nBrilliant!\nWhile I agree with a lot of the points above this inevitably does raise the ‘breast’ vs ‘bottle’ debate. Being a new mum who was unable to breastfeed (it was not a choice!) I really struggled with feelings of guilt and failure despite how well my little boy was doing or how good our bond had always been. The lack of information and advice for formula feeding made the situation even harder and I feel selling formula in plain packaging will only add to these issues. Yes the industry should be carefully monitored but we should be supporting all new mothers, including those who bottle feed either through choice or necessity, rather than making them feel they have failed in some way .\nI 100% agree, I am a new mum and was unable to breatfeed but can say I read this and was overwhelmed with guilt. Promoting breastfeeding is amazing and people should be very proud but using words like ‘women who have failed at the first steps into motherhood’ is absolutely disgraceful. My son is well fed, looked after and we have an amazing bond, this bill makes you feel like your doing something not good but not quite illegal. Smoking has plain packaging and this is what they are treating it as, I am absolutely furious about this, there should be more help for women who cannot breastfeed, I know there is a lot for women who do breastfeed. Breast maybe best but it was not best for my son, personally as long as your baby is well fed, well looked after and loved unconditionally then your doing an amazing job and don’t need to be told any different.\nYou are quite right. My language was ill advised and I should gave been more clear. I can only speak from my personal experience and that was that I felt like I had failed in my first steps into motherhood. I don’t feel like a failure now. I know it was the system that failed me but at first, I felt like I failed my son. My first job as a mother was to feed my boy and I couldn’t. I need to be more careful with my language and I apologise if it caused offence.\nExactly my point Amy. We appear to be comparing formula to cigarettes. This is so wrong, on so many levels.\nI was ready to come on here and stick up for formula feeding mums thinking this was another attack on them but I actually agree with this bill after reading it. Good work. Good to know people who choose to formula feed are being protected in this way. Not sure about the plain packaging though. I like to know what’s in what I feed my baby! Perhaps the Minister could also do something about the breast feeding information provided to new mums. It’s only the positives we are told about, none of the negatives. I would still have wanted to do it if I was told about the negative side and would have been more prepared for how hard it can be at first. I think many mums, including myself, would persevere with feeding for longer if they had all information available to them- good and bad!\nUp until I was 30 I had a real problem with breastfeeding. It was unnatural, weird, even perverted.\nThat’s until I had my first baby. I wanted to mix feed, I wanted to be in on the act. My wife and (independent) Midwife said no. I was being a brat, and quite frankly I was putting myself before the baby.\nMy wife struggled at first, her nipples looked like they might actually fall off, but for the good of our daughter she continued. Fortunately we found baby had a tounge tie, and one breastfeeding consultation later she continued to feed her for the next 3 years.\nAnd I am proud of that.\nI went away and read about the benefits, not just about the milk, but the process of feeding itself.\nSadly not everyone is as headstrong as my wife. Advertising works. My old marketing teacher used to say adverts don’t make us buy a product but persuade us which one to choose.\nWhich is where I was for all those years before I grew up. All those images and messages for decades imprinted on my brain. Formula feeding is just as good, only weirdos breastfeed, look at the fun they are having feeding.\nI am not surprised as a nation our heads are turned.\nIf we continue to ignore the power of marketing we are doing mothers of today and tomorrow, and our children a complete disservice.\nThank you for this bill.",

Speakers included Katie Piper, television presenter and founder of the Katie Piper Foundation, feminist campaigner Caroline Criado-Perez, Angela Rippon, television journalist, newsreader and presenter and patients and Dr Gina Radford, Deputy Chief Medical Officer at the Department of Health.\nPaula Sherriff MP, Chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Women’s Health, said:\n“It is not acceptable that in 21st Century Britain, women are not treated with appropriate sensitivity and respect in our NHS. The NHS does an excellent job looking after us, but a universal culture should be adopted across the service where dignity is the key word.\n“I hope that our open letter to Jeremy Hunt and NHS England calling for this culture shift, and the launch of this Group, serves as notice that MPs are determined to campaign for an NHS where women are able to make confident informed choices about their own health and they are supported with respect and dignity.”\nAlison Thewliss MP stated:\n“I was keen to show my support for efforts to raise awareness of women’s health conditions that have not received the attention that they deserve.

The questionnaire focussed on maternal nutrition, breastfeeding, infant feeding and related health behaviours.\nThe survey pointed to progress being made in many areas, with 43% of mothers now continuing to breastfeed up to six months after birth, compared with 32% in 2010. In addition, it spoke to an increase in the overall duration of breastfeeding.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“It is greatly encouraging to see an uplift in the number of mothers who are breastfeeding for longer, and I am delighted that this increase is a significant one. It’s important to recognise the work going on in hospitals and local areas by both health professionals and volunteer peer supporters, as this couldn’t be achieved without their incredible efforts.\n“The Unicef UK Baby Friendly Initiative standards recommend that, in order to maximise health outcomes for children, breastfeeding should be promoted exclusively for the first six months. In that sense, it’s terrific to see so many women in Scotland maximising breastmilk and introducing solid foods later.\n“I know there is still a lot of work to be done in this area. Whilst help and information is given to mothers to promote and assist with breastfeeding, the survey results show the main reasons for breastfeeding ceasing early is due to concerns around feeding problems, and also finding feeding too difficult. It’s therefore crucial that health professionals continue to provide and develop ongoing support.\n“Studies such as this are fundamental, as they provide an evidence base on which more informed policy decisions can be made, in this case to help design and implement better advice and support for families. It’s crucial that the UK Government do the same, in order to improve health outcomes across the country”.",

The response, issued by the National Statistician’s Office suggest that over 100,000 people in Scotland still earn below the minimum wage.\nCommenting on the data, Glasgow Central MP Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“These figures shine a very bright light on the UK Government’s awful record on pay and more specifically, pay inequality.\n“One of the main reasons cited for increased food bank usage – in addition to benefit sanctions – is low pay which is absolutely scandalous for twenty first century Britain. It is perhaps one of the clearest signs that we are not all in this together and people aren’t benefiting from the UK continuing to have decision making powers over pay.\n“So often we hear this UK Government’s much coveted long term economic plan, but it’s not working if tens of thousands of people aren’t even being paid a minimum wage, let alone a living wage.\n“Serious questions need to be asked about how, 18 years on from minimum wage legislation being introduced, so many people are still being exploited and let down by this Government.\n“One of things these figures reveal is that young people in particular lose out big time. The SNP is clear – we believe that pay shouldn’t be based on your age.

I come to this debate with absolutely no judgement or attempt to tell other parents how to feed their children.\n“I believe it is vitally important that parents get accurate information on the contents of formula milk, and the best way to prepare it safely. At present there is a worrying lack of independent scrutiny of infant and young child formula, as well as growing frustration about the industry marketing tricks and misleading claims being pushed on parents and health professionals alike.\n“Misinformation on health policy never ends well and I believe this requires an urgent change in the law, to seriously tighten up the behaviour of some companies.\n“Currently, a loophole allows for misleading and scientifically questionable claims to be printed in reputable and highly respected medical and nursing journals. This is an untenable position and the legislation I am proposing will tackle this issue head on.\n“My bill would also mean that the UK fully implements the international Code of Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes, which has been called for in numerous reports.\n“I am hopeful that the House of Commons approves permission to formally introduce the bill today and let it have a second reading in Parliament.”\nThe Government needs to take responsibility for this, as parents and the general public are very confused – seeing any attempt to protect babies through better legislation as an attack on bottle feeding parents, rather than the reverse.

It is an inherently risky journey for people who are already vulnerable and desperate.\nHowever, there is no evidence to suggest that this Bill will have any impact on the number of dangerous crossings, or that a restrictive asylum policy in general acts as a deterrent. It is clear that the Home Office is aware of the limitations of these kinds of policies. In 2022, the Rwanda scheme lacked evidence to the point where the Civil Service was unable to confirm its value for public money.\nIt is extremely worrying to see the UK Government press ahead with policies which pose a serious and consistent threat to our international human rights obligations. It is worse still when these policies show no promise of delivering their intended consequences. This Bill will not make people safe – it will put victims of trafficking and modern slavery even more at risk, and leave refugees fleeing persecution in limbo, or offshored thousands of miles away.\nParliamentarians in both Scotland and the UK are human rights guarantors, and an important part of our role is to ensure that legislation is compliant with international obligations on human rights. The incompatibility of the Bill with the European Convention on Human Rights, the Refugee Convention, The Convention of Action Against Trafficking, and the Convention on the Rights of the Child means that we as lawmakers are obliged to vote against it.\nThe undermining of rights conveyed upon individuals by these agreements must be resisted by all spheres of government. This Bill will negatively impact directly on those seeking international protection in Scotland, as well as on the powers and duties of the Scottish Government, local authorities, and other public bodies under the devolution settlement. We call upon MSPs to withhold legislative consent when this legislation is put before the Scottish Parliament.\nArbitrary detention of refugee and asylum-seeking children and their families, trafficking victims, victims of torture and other vulnerable people is entirely unacceptable. You may recall that Scotland led the way in campaigning against child detention. In May 2010, Dungavel was closed to children, with detention centres elsewhere in the UK rapidly following suit. It is unthinkable that we now face a situation where these rights are being rolled back.\nScotland’s refugee and asylum-seeking community deserves better.

Parliamentarians dressed as teal heroes, learned more about the symptoms of ovarian cancer and committed to helping raise awareness. The designated colour for ovarian cancer is teal.\n11 women die every day from ovarian cancer. Early diagnosis saves lives, and raising awareness of the symptoms of ovarian cancer is crucial.\nThe symptoms of ovarian cancer are:\n- Persistent bloating – not bloating that comes and goes\n- Feeling full quickly and/or loss of appetite\n- Pelvic or abdominal pain (that’s your tummy and below)\n- Urinary symptoms (needing to wee more urgently or more often than usual)\nOther symptoms can include unexpected weight loss, changes in bowel habits, and extreme fatigue.\nAlison Thewliss MP commented:\n“Being a ‘teal hero’ was a great opportunity to take action and raise awareness of ovarian cancer. Although there was a fun element to the event, ensuring women know the symptoms of this disease is extremely serious and I plan on continuing to be a teal hero in the future, working to ensure more women are diagnosed sooner.”\nAnnwen Jones, Chief Executive of Target Ovarian Cancer, said:\n“It has been delightful to see the MPs getting involved and learning the symptoms of ovarian cancer. Early diagnosis of ovarian cancer makes the disease easier to treat, so Target Ovarian Cancer is urging everyone to learn the symptoms during Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month this March. Our goal has been to inspire parliamentarians to become more engaged with ovarian cancer and the issues around the disease, and effect change at a national level. We are hugely grateful for all they do.”\nKatherine Taylor, Chief Executive of Ovarian Cancer Action, said:\n“We cannot fight ovarian cancer alone; which is why it is fantastic to see members of parliament showing their support this Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month. We need to educate everyone from politicians, to healthcare professionals, to women and men across the UK to recognise the symptoms of ovarian cancer. Symptoms include persistent stomach pain, persistent bloating, feeling full quickly and needing to wee more often. If you recognise any of these, be as persistent with your GP as your symptoms are with you.”\nAthena Lamnisos, Chief Executive of The Eve Appeal, said:\n“With ovarian cancer it’s about knowing the signs and symptoms so that you can avoid the trauma of a late diagnosis and the grim statistics that go with Stage 3 and 4 disease. That’s why The Eve Appeal know it’s vital to have open conversations about your health and know the signs and symptoms of all the women-specific cancers. With ovarian cancer especially the signs might not automatically lead either a woman or her GP to immediately think of cancer and that’s why arming yourself with information can literally be a life-saver.”\nVictoria Clare, Chief Executive of Ovacome, said:\n“It is great to see so many MPs getting involved in raising awareness of the symptoms of ovarian cancer. By working together to raise awareness we really will make progress in detecting and treating the disease.

According to research by Anthony Nolan, one in five are not offered any specialist care to help with their recovery, which includes access to physiotherapists, counsellors, and fertility experts.\nAnthony Nolan is calling on health commissioners across the UK to urgently review the care arrangements they have in place for transplant recipients once they leave hospital, to ensure that patients and their families can continue to access vital support and services.\nAt an event in the House of Commons on Wednesday 11 October, Alison Thewliss MP heard from patient representatives about how difficult recovery can be without appropriate support.\nAlison Thewliss MP said:\n“A number of my constituents have got in touch to bring this issue to my attention, so I know how important it is for people in Glasgow that stem cell transplant patients and their families receive appropriate support.\n“No patient’s recovery should be made more difficult by a lack of care and support, and that’s why I’m backing Anthony Nolan’s campaign, urging health commissioners to review the care arrangements they have in place once transplant patients leave hospital.”\nHenny Braund, Chief Executive of Anthony Nolan, said:\n“It’s vital that health commissioners carry out an urgent review into the long-term care that stem cell transplant recipients need throughout their recovery, so we’re delighted to have the support of Alison Thewliss MP in raising awareness of this issue in Parliament and in their constituency.\n“Anthony Nolan is calling on health commissioners to work with us and the clinical community and make sure that post-transplant care works for every patient, to ensure they get the support they need to make a good recovery.”",

Political concern and controversy has been growing about the highly addictive nature of the machines, with one campaign group even calling them the ‘crack cocaine’ of gambling.\nThe cross party group of MPs and Peers, published its report in January 2017, assessing the impact of FOBTs, and called for a substantial reduction in the maximum stake playable, stating that there was a strong case for this to be no more than £2.\nThe campaign has secured the widespread support with 93 local authorities, the Royal Society for Public Health and politicians from all parties supporting the campaign.\nLending her support to the campaign for a stake reduction, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“The case for action on FOBTs is clear and I urge the Government to act now and cut the stake. There is no excuse for the continued misery these machines are causing. The problems associated with them are obvious, and it is really not acceptable to be able to walk in off the street and stake such a high amount with no checks or safeguards in place whatsoever.\n“I am extremely concerned to hear that £10,303,128 was lost to FOBTs in Glasgow Central. We cannot go on with this situation. I urge the Government to bring forward their proposals, and to cut the maximum stake on FOBTs to £2 without further delay.\nThe Government is currently considering responses from the Call for Evidence into Gaming Machines and Social Responsibility launched in October 2016. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport is expected to publish the next stage of the Review, with its proposals, in October 2017.\nThe FOBT APPG is chaired by Carolyn Harris MP and is supported by groups including Bacta, The Hippodrome Casino, Novomatic, Praesepe and the Royal Society for Public Health.",

Over three million people have been displaced and 10,000 people have been killed during the civil war.\n“Yemen day was a valuable opportunity for a range of interested parties to come together and take stock of the current situation in Yemen. It was an incredibly sobering experience to reflect on the fact that 12 million Yemenis lack sufficient food and over 460,000 children under the age of five are at serious risk of malnutrition. 4.5 million people in Yemen urgently require emergency shelter.\n“This week, the Disasters Emergency Committee launched an urgent appeal and I would encourage as many people as possible to donate to that vital fundraising drive. As important as aid is, we also need significant diplomatic intervention so that agencies can deliver life saving services.\n“Wednesday’s revelation that the United States is suspending some of its Saudi arms sales is a small but welcome step forward. It is now incumbent upon the United Kingdom Government to immediately follow suit and suspend the sale of the UK-produced bombs which have been bombarding Yemen.

  "http_www_alisonthewliss_scot/http_www_alisonthewliss_scot_snp-mp-calls-for-more-guidance-on-breastmilk-sharing/content_142.html": "Alison Thewliss, SNP MP for Glasgow Central, has urged the UK Government to offer guidance on milk sharing – a practice that thousands of women are already participating in through online networks across the country.\nMilk sharing has become an increasingly popular method for mothers to get access to breastmilk for their babies, particularly amongst those who have encountered difficulties when breastfeeding.\nThe sharing of breastmilk online is unregulated and some experts are concerned that without NHS supervision or Government guidance, there is a chance that the practice could spread infection and viruses.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“There is a growing recognition of the unique qualities of breastmilk, and the growth of milk sharing online is to some degree a symptom of this. It is important that milk donors are following best practice to ensure breastmilk is free from any contaminants, but this will always have a degree of uncertainty when people are sharing milk online.\n“Milk banks provide safe and rigorously screened donor breastmilk for those babies who need it. The model used by One Milk Bank for Scotland ensures that breastmilk can be collected from donors, processed and distributed using a well-developed network, and I would like to see this available across the rest of the UK. At the moment, milk banks are often underfunded and running as a project of individual hospitals.\n“This also sits in the context of cuts to breastfeeding support projects – Unicef Baby Friendly highlighted recently that local infant feeding leads in England had reported a 47% cut in support groups, and a 58% cut in health visitors. Women who wish to breastfeed can find themselves without the valuable support and expertise they need, and may turn to online donors as an alternative to their own milk.\n“I am keen for the UK Government to work with the UK Association of Milk Banks to invest in services to allow those wishing to donate breastmilk to be able to do so locally, in a safe and regulated way, and for those requiring breastmilk for their babies to be able to access it easily. I have asked to meet with Ministers to discuss how breastmilk can be shared safely.”",
  "http_www_alisonthewliss_scot/https_www_alisonthewliss_scot_author_athewlissmp_page_18/content_743.html": "SNP MP, Alison Thewliss, has hit out at new data which suggests that the Government is failing miserably to get a grip on tackling low and exploitative pay.\nCommenting following the publication of answers to a series of written parliamentary questions she tabled, the Glasgow MP said Prime Minister Theresa May’s apparent desire to tackle the “burning injustices” in society, as well as efforts to support the “just about managing”, was nothing more than empty rhetoric.\nSeizing on data released to her by Treasury and Cabinet Office Ministers, Ms Thewliss said this wasn’t the first time she had raised the issue, having requested similar data from Government officials last year. Following that, she wrote a scathing letter to the former Prime Minister David Cameron, urging him to make tackling low pay a priority.\nCommenting, Glasgow Central SNP MP Alison Thewliss said:\n“Last summer might have seen a change of occupant in 10 Downing Street but it appears to be business as usual for this Tory Government; they appear to have no interest whatsoever in tackling pay inequality and exploitation. Theresa May’s impassioned speech on the steps of Downing Street has been exposed again and again as empty rhetoric.\n“Disappointingly, when I obtained last year’s data from the Government, over 100,000 Scots were still being paid below the national minimum wage. This is in stark contrast to the Scottish Government, and huge swathes of Scotland’s public services, who pay the real living wage of £8.45 per hour.\n“House of Commons Library figures reveal that for 2015-16 alone 950 employers have been found by HMRC not to be paying the minimum wage. Over the past decade only 13 prosecutions have taken place for non-compliance, which simply beggars belief.\n“These shocking figures also show that the Government is doing very little to crack down on employers who aren’t complying with National Minimum Wage legislation passed almost two decades ago. Indeed, the Minister’s response reveals the Government don’t think it’s worth prosecuting companies for non-compliance. This sends an incredibly worrying signal to exploitative employers who will think it is perfectly acceptable to pay peanuts for a fair day’s work.\n“If Theresa May is truly serious about supporting the “just about managing” in society, she needs to implement an urgent action plan.\n“The Prime Minister should start by cracking down heavily on exploitative employers who are flouting minimum wage laws. Companies won’t take this matter seriously if all they can expect is a rap on the knuckles.\n“Theresa May should implement a real living wage, as set by the Living Wage Foundation, rather than the pale imitation being punted by her Chancellor. The real Living Wage is being successfully promoted by the Scottish Government, with Scottish Canals being announced just this week as the 700th employer in Scotland to sign up.\n“Thirdly, and as part of an action plan, we need to have genuine pay equality – not just for women but for young people as well. Currently, the UK Government has a ridiculous system whereby minimum wage rates are set in accordance with age. That means if you’re a sixteen year old apprentice, the law says you can be paid as little as £3.40 per hour. How does that fit into the Prime Minister’s new obsession about a shared society?\n“I’ve written to the Prime Minister setting out three very simple and practical steps she could take to tackle this – I hope sincerely I won’t be sending the same action plan next year when I request these figures from the Government again”.",

Parliamentarians also got the chance to pose for photographs with Fairtrade Ambassador Nick Hewer, famous for his roles on Countdown and The Apprentice.\nFairtrade Fortnight 2018 will challenge the British public to open their doors to Fairtrade and help close the door on the exploitation facing farmers and producers in developing nations.\nThe nationwide campaign ‘Come On In’ runs from Monday 26 February until Sunday 11 March and will invite the public to come in to the world of the people who grow our food to see what life can be like when farmers and workers aren’t paid fairly. The campaign will explore how businesses, farmers, workers and shoppers can come together through Fairtrade to change this.\nThousands of events will be taking place around the country including breakfasts, breaks, bake-offs and more as people ‘Come On In’ and find out more about Fairtrade.\nAlison Thewliss MP said:\n“It is wonderful to be able to show my support for Fairtrade alongside my fellow parliamentarians.\n“Fairtrade Fortnight is a hugely important event and I would encourage the people of Glasgow to get involved wherever they can.\n“We can all play a role in ensuring a fair deal for farmers and producers in developing nations simply by ensuring we buy Fairtrade wherever possible.”\nCheryl McGechie, Director of Public Engagement, The Fairtrade Foundation said:\n“This Fairtrade Fortnight, we are inviting people to ‘Come On In’ to find out what Fairtrade does for farmers and see what exploitation looks like when trade doesn’t deliver.\n“There has never been a better time to stand alongside the people who produce the things we love to eat, drink and wear. People who often do not earn enough to feed, or provide for their own families.\n“This unfairness must end. By buying Fairtrade you are guaranteeing farmers a fair price for their efforts. This Fairtrade Fortnight ‘Come On In’ to Fairtrade.”\nBrad Hill, Fairtrade Strategy Manager at Co-op, said:\n“From selling the UK’s first Fairtrade bananas and the world’s very first own-brand product with the Fairtrade Mark, through to making entire own-brand categories Fairtrade we at Co-op have continued to drive the benefits of Fairtrade. We will continually look for ways and areas that we can develop to help make positive impact and life changes for farmers in developing countries.\n“Last year we extended our commitment further in a retailer first and announced that all the cocoa sourced for own brand products will be sourced on Fairtrade terms. This year we will be increasing our sourcing of the other core Fairtrade commodities to drive further Fairtrade Premium to producer communities. Our recent move saw us become the first in the world to adopt the new Fairtrade Sourced Ingredient program on flowers, meaning that all the African roses Co-op sources for use across our entire flower range will return a Fairtrade Premium. Some 35 million Co-op rose stems a year are now certified as Fairtrade and will go to help graduate nurses find employment in Kenya.\n“We believe the right approach is to build upon the success of Fairtrade. That’s why in addition to our sourcing commitments we are investing directly to extend further the benefits of our trading relationship and investing directly in our producers and their communities.”\nTony Rowson, Head of Retail at Greggs said:\n“As a responsible business, we believe in doing the right thing and are incredibly proud to be a long-standing partner of Fairtrade.\n“A number of our products, including coffee, tea, sugar and bananas, are certified Fairtrade and we continue to add more items to the menu, including green tea and peppermint tea more recently.\n“Having worked with Fairtrade for over ten years now, it has been incredible to see the positive impact and difference it makes to producer communities and we look forward to strengthening our relationship further in the future.”",
  "http_www_alisonthewliss_scot/https_www_alisonthewliss_scot_category_campaigns_page_15/content_523.html": "SNP MP Alison Thewliss has spoken of her “utter disappointment” following her meeting today (Thursday 19th May) with Lord Freud, Minister of State for Welfare Reform, at the Department of Work & Pensions.\nFollowing months of campaigning, Prime Minister David Cameron finally relented and organised a meeting between the SNP MP and his Welfare Reform Minister, which took place this morning.\nMs Thewliss had just forty-five minutes to question Freud and his officials on their “draconian” plans for a rape clause and two child policy which she said was “tantamount to social engineering”.\nCommenting after her meeting at the DWP’s Caxton House HQ in London, Ms Thewliss said:\n“Today’s meeting was one of the most frustrating and soul destroying meetings I’ve ever had to endure in my nine years of elected public office, first as a Councillor and now as an MP.\n“Lord Freud showed no compassion for the vulnerable women and families who will be subjected to some of the most draconian welfare reforms in the world, reforms which are tantamount to social engineering.\n“The Prime Minister himself conceded the Government had “more to do” on this policy, and promised that they would consult on this. When I pressed the Minister, it turns out that the Government have consulted just four organisations on a policy which will cause unimaginable pain and distress to victims of rape.\n“This Government clearly does not appreciate that the majority of rapes happen within abusive relationships, and that pushing women to claim could place them and their children in a very dangerous position. During the course of the meeting, Lord Freud suggested that women should “just flee”, without appreciating how incredibly difficult that can be. This comes at the same time when women’s refuges are under threat by Tory cuts to housing benefit. That is simply unacceptable and confirms my worst fears that this is the most uncaring, heartless and cruel UK Government yet.\n“On restricting tax credits to the first two children in a family, Lord Freud made great play of the fact that 85% of families have two or less children, therefore this policy would only impact a small minority of people. He couldn’t answer why the Government is legislating to attack such a small minority. He confirmed that he had not consulted with any religious groups, who may be disproportionately affected by the restriction.\n“I was further appalled to hear that they have no intention of protecting eligibility to tax credits for families composed of children from previous relationships, which further undermines the Government’s much vaunted ‘family test’.\n“I am absolutely gutted by this Tory Government’s lack of compassion, but I will continue the fight to end to this policy. It’s just a shame that the UK Government are so hell bent on pushing ahead with this that they’ll be as obstructive as possible.”",

The UK has the largest cultural economy in the world relative to GDP and is the largest producer of recorded music in Europe and is the second largest exporter of music (after the US).\nIt is vital we get the best possible deal for the sector in a number of areas that have been so critical to its success – the ability to tour and trade easily with the UK’s largest export market and to attract talent, IP protection, EU arts funding, workers’ rights and the rights of EU citizens in the UK.\nMusicians are very concerned that the Brexit process may lead to the introduction of individual member state work permits and/or visas for British musicians touring and working across Europe. Most professional musicians and performers rely on touring and travelling for their careers and livelihoods and gigs are often organised at short notice. As some performers can be working in several different European countries over the course of a few days, the possible introduction of work permissions and/or visas for British musicians touring and working in Europe could be extremely detrimental.\nAlison Thewliss MP says: “Today, I confirmed my support for professional musicians and performers in my constituency, and will urge the Government to ensure that they can continue to be able to travel easily across Europe post-Brexit for touring and performing with minimum administrative burdens”.\nHorace Trubridge, Musicians’ Union General Secretary says: “British musicians have long enjoyed easy access to touring in Europe, as UK venues and festivals have benefited from easy access to European performers.

Analysis by Kantar found that grocery prices were 5.9% higher this month than a year ago – the biggest rise since December 2011 – and that the average food bill could increase by £271 this year. It follows recent figures this month that highlighted that prices are increasing at their fastest rate in decades with inflation rising to 7% – a staggering 30-year high.

This is an entitlement which a large amount of my constituents have not redeemed.\n“In this cost-of-living crisis, any additional money during these difficult times could make a massive difference to people’s lives.\n“If you are using a traditional prepayment meter and have not received any of the monthly vouchers through the post, or by email or text message, you can contact your energy supplier to enquire about this payment. This must be done before the 1st June to ensure you are eligible for the payment.\n“If any Glasgow Central constituents are in need of support for this payment, please do not hesitate to contact my office via email: alison.thewliss.mp@parliament.uk, or via phone call: 0141 552 7117.

Nursing is a highly-skilled profession and nursing staff care for patients in a variety of settings such as, at music festivals, in prisons and in accident and emergency departments.\nNurses’ Day is an international event held annually on Florence Nightingale’s birthday (12 May). This year, the RCN is showcasing nurses’ dedication to delivering outstanding patient care and the innovative and diverse roles nurses have in healthcare teams. The RCN is also encouraging nursing staff to use the hashtag #ThisNurse to share stories of colleagues who went the extra mile to provide patient care and times which reminded them why there are nursing in 2018.\nAlison Thewliss MP said:\n“Nurses’ Day is a fantastic way to show our support for nursing staff in our health and care services. It’s our chance to thank them for the care they provide to our families, friends, neighbours and colleagues. I encourage everyone to celebrate the remarkable work of nursing staff in Glasgow and across Scotland.”\nJanet Davies, Chief Executive and General Secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, said\n“Nursing is a dynamic profession with caring for people at its heart. Nurses’ Day is a wonderful opportunity to celebrate the incredible work nursing staff do every single day of the year.\n“There is no ‘one size fits all’ rule for nursing staff.

  "http_www_alisonthewliss_scot/https_www_alisonthewliss_scot_category_press-releases_page_6/content_727.html": "SNP MP, Alison Thewliss, has hit out at new data which suggests that the Government is failing miserably to get a grip on tackling low and exploitative pay.\nCommenting following the publication of answers to a series of written parliamentary questions she tabled, the Glasgow MP said Prime Minister Theresa May’s apparent desire to tackle the “burning injustices” in society, as well as efforts to support the “just about managing”, was nothing more than empty rhetoric.\nSeizing on data released to her by Treasury and Cabinet Office Ministers, Ms Thewliss said this wasn’t the first time she had raised the issue, having requested similar data from Government officials last year. Following that, she wrote a scathing letter to the former Prime Minister David Cameron, urging him to make tackling low pay a priority.\nCommenting, Glasgow Central SNP MP Alison Thewliss said:\n“Last summer might have seen a change of occupant in 10 Downing Street but it appears to be business as usual for this Tory Government; they appear to have no interest whatsoever in tackling pay inequality and exploitation. Theresa May’s impassioned speech on the steps of Downing Street has been exposed again and again as empty rhetoric.\n“Disappointingly, when I obtained last year’s data from the Government, over 100,000 Scots were still being paid below the national minimum wage. This is in stark contrast to the Scottish Government, and huge swathes of Scotland’s public services, who pay the real living wage of £8.45 per hour.\n“House of Commons Library figures reveal that for 2015-16 alone 950 employers have been found by HMRC not to be paying the minimum wage. Over the past decade only 13 prosecutions have taken place for non-compliance, which simply beggars belief.\n“These shocking figures also show that the Government is doing very little to crack down on employers who aren’t complying with National Minimum Wage legislation passed almost two decades ago. Indeed, the Minister’s response reveals the Government don’t think it’s worth prosecuting companies for non-compliance. This sends an incredibly worrying signal to exploitative employers who will think it is perfectly acceptable to pay peanuts for a fair day’s work.\n“If Theresa May is truly serious about supporting the “just about managing” in society, she needs to implement an urgent action plan.\n“The Prime Minister should start by cracking down heavily on exploitative employers who are flouting minimum wage laws. Companies won’t take this matter seriously if all they can expect is a rap on the knuckles.\n“Theresa May should implement a real living wage, as set by the Living Wage Foundation, rather than the pale imitation being punted by her Chancellor. The real Living Wage is being successfully promoted by the Scottish Government, with Scottish Canals being announced just this week as the 700th employer in Scotland to sign up.\n“Thirdly, and as part of an action plan, we need to have genuine pay equality – not just for women but for young people as well. Currently, the UK Government has a ridiculous system whereby minimum wage rates are set in accordance with age. That means if you’re a sixteen year old apprentice, the law says you can be paid as little as £3.40 per hour. How does that fit into the Prime Minister’s new obsession about a shared society?\n“I’ve written to the Prime Minister setting out three very simple and practical steps she could take to tackle this – I hope sincerely I won’t be sending the same action plan next year when I request these figures from the Government again”.",

The fact that so many objections have been submitted should speak volumes to the city’s planning committee.\n“I visited Glasgow School of Art only recently and it’s absolutely clear that this development would significantly dwarf this unique Grade A listed building. The Mackintosh building is a precious part of Glasgow’s skyline and this should be protected. The scale of the proposed development would also restrict light into the building, which is crucial to the functioning of the School of Art.\n“Glasgow is becoming saturated with student accommodation, with little assessment of either the need for this, the impact on local communities or on the wider landscape of the city.\n“I hope the Council will take on board the significant concerns raised and throw these plans out unconditionally”.",

The ship is thought to be the last four-masted iron-hulled sailing vessel of its kind anywhere in the world.\n“This Clyde built ship was launched in 1878 and has visited every continent of the world save Antarctica.\n“There is growing interest in repatriating the boat to Scotland from organisations like Old Gorbals Heritage Group, the City of Glasgow College’s Riverside campus and many others in Scotland and around the world.\n“The River Clyde is full of potential and it would be absolutely amazing to bring the ship home and perhaps run it as a sail training venture.

The UK Government claims that these changes would reduce spending on disability benefits by £3.7 billion. In reality, the changes will deny over 160,000 people access to Personal Independence Payment, cutting vital support which helps people cope with the extra costs of living with disability.\nThese changes come on the back of the comments made by Tory MP and head of the Number 10 Policy Unit George Freeman, who said that the changes would ensure that benefits went to people who are “really disabled” rather than people “who suffer from anxiety”. Mr Freeman’s comments have drawn criticism from disability rights organisations for the insensitive way that he portrayed sufferers of anxiety.\nCommenting on the legislation, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“For a Tory MP, and one of Theresa May’s most senior advisers, to suggest that people with a mental health condition are not “really disabled” is completely unacceptable and wrong. George Freeman’s words highlight this Tory government’s total lack of understanding or compassion when it comes to providing for those who are less fortunate than others.\n“The Tories said there would be no further cuts to disability support during this parliament, but once again they have shown that the price of their failed austerity project is to be borne by those who are least able to afford it.\n“The UK government must urgently clarify what these new proposals will mean for people who currently receive Personal Independence Payment and give a concrete assurance that any changes will not result in a reduction in financial support for disabled people.\n“I have signed the “prayer” motion laid down in the House of Commons to formally object to this legislation and I call on MPs from across the House of Commons to unite in opposition against these changes.”",

Just like we did for Ukraine.\n“This visa would provide them with an opportunity to seek refuge and reunite with their families safely in the UK.\n“By implementing this visa, the government can demonstrate its commitment to compassion, inclusivity, and supporting those who have endured the hardships of war.\n“Together, let’s urge the government to enact policies that provide a lifeline for Palestinians seeking safety and a chance to rebuild their lives safely.”\nIn response to the petition, the UK Government said:\n“There are no plans to introduce bespoke arrangements for people arriving from the region. Those wishing to come to the UK who currently have no visa can apply under one of the existing visa routes.”\nIn the House of Commons on Tuesday, Thewliss questioned why the UK Government was not waiving the requirement for Palestinians to register biometrics.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“The UK Government are showing a blatant disregard for Palestinians who wish to escape a war zone to reunite with family in the UK. At present, people can’t escape Gaza without having biometrics registered – but there’s no facility to do this. The UK Government has it within their power to waive this requirement, and it’s deeply concerning that they won’t do so.\n“The petition by Gaza Families Reunited creates a clear and coherent plan which the UK Government must listen to.

The MP for Glasgow Central has been a long-standing advocate for an alternative approach to tackling drug-injecting, and the associated public health concerns. The Bill has drawn support from all political parties, with many supporters recognising that the status quo was failing to adequately tackle the matter.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“With this Bill, I want to send a very clear message – with widespread and cross-party support – to the UK Government that the status-quo is doing nothing to help the drug-injecting population. Today’s Bill is on the issue of Supervised Drug Consumption Facilities, and the associated proposals for a pilot facility in my constituency of Glasgow Central.\n“The problems associated with public injecting are patently clear: my constituency office regularly receives reports of needles and other drug paraphernalia being discarded in public places, and I have seen drug-injecting taking place in locations not far from where my office is located.\n“The complex health issues for the drug-injecting population in Scotland are becoming ever more alarming, especially for an ageing population who have been injecting for a long time. In Scotland in 2016 there were 867 deaths from fatal overdoses of drugs – the highest number of deaths from drug overdose in Europe. We cannot stand still on this issue any longer.\n“Doing the same thing, over and over, is failing families, communities, and those using drugs. Supervised injecting facilities may not solve everything, but they have worked elsewhere and the Home Office must support my Bill and allow Glasgow to go ahead and assess these proposals with the pilot.”",

  "http_www_alisonthewliss_scot/https_www_alisonthewliss_scot_author_athewlissmp_page_10/content_761.html": "New research from Scottish Gas has highlighted that having no heating or hot water would be the number one disaster for households in Scotland this winter. Even so, many people in Glasgow have not taken action to ensure their homes are winter-ready.\nDespite the autumn chill, a national survey* shows that more than a third of households (35%) in Scotland have not checked that their central heating is working and nearly four in ten have not prepared their home for winter by getting their boiler serviced. Having an annual boiler service carried out by a Gas Safe registered engineer is crucial as it detects problems with the boiler and controls, including whether it is leaking poisonous carbon monoxide.\nKeeping homes safe is an important part of winter preparation, yet only four in ten households in Scotland have checked that their carbon monoxide alarm is working. Carbon monoxide is known as the ‘silent killer’, because the gas has no odour or taste, and is invisible. Fitting an audible alarm is the second line of defence against carbon monoxide poisoning.\nBeing energy efficient is particularly important during the winter months, and technology can help with this. Whilst more than half of households in Scotland (51%) acknowledge that technology could help their home to run more smoothly during winter, less than a third (32%) have smart meters.\nHaving smart meters installed can help keep household energy in check, as they automatically send readings to the energy supplier. Smart meters also come with a display that shows you how much energy is being used, in pounds and pence, in near real-time, and identify where savings can be made.\nAlison Thewliss MP said: “It’s really important to keep a step ahead of winter. I want everyone in Glasgow to understand what help is available for them, and for their family and friends. Being energy efficient and keeping bills under control is really important, so I’d encourage people to get in touch with their energy supplier to find out what support is on offer.”\nScottish Gas engineer Stephen Cosgrove, who fixes and repairs boilers, said: “Winter can be a challenging time for households, but there are some practical steps that you can take, with our help, to make sure that you are prepared:\nGet the best deal\nWe have been working hard to ensure buying energy is simple, transparent and fair for customers – for every customer on a standard variable tariff they will get an Annual Energy Health Check to make sure they’re on the right tariff. This will highlight other ways we can help our customers save money like replacing old and inefficient boilers or insulating their homes for free.\nGet smart meters\nYour energy supplier will be able to install smart meters, which mean an end to estimated bills.

Find out more by visiting: www.britishgasenergytrust.org.uk.\nBleed your radiators: to make sure they are working properly. If your radiators have cold spots at the top, this means you have air in the system, so you will need to bleed them to get them working efficiently.\na. To do this, turn the system off and when cool turn the radiator key until the air stops and water runs consistently. Once you have turned the system back on, the problem should be solved.\nb. Cold spots in the bottom or centre of the radiator may be an indication of sludge build up and the need for system flushing.\nc. Bleeding your radiator may result in pressure dropping. If you have a pressure gauge, make sure the boiler is at the right pressure and top up as necessary.\nBlock the breeze: Make sure all of your windows and doors seal properly to stop warm air escaping. For those that don’t, fitting draught excluders, which you can buy from most DIY stores, is a quick and cheap way to cut down on your energy bills.\nStay safe: It’s vital to have a carbon monoxide alarm fitted and that you test it regularly.\nLove your boiler: Check to make sure that your boiler is working properly before winter sets in. The older your boiler, the more inefficient it will be. If you have a pressure gauge, make sure the boiler is at the right pressure and top up as necessary.\nInsulate your pipes: Burst pipes are a huge issue during winter months. To help prevent burst pipes, ensure all pipes are properly insulated by using lagging, which can be bought cheaply from most DIY shops.\nMaintain your drains: If you’re trying to keep your drains outside well maintained, it’s a good idea to make sure they are clear of debris at the point at which they enter the ground. This involves checking your gullies for autumnal leaves and twigs in order to ensure that they don’t restrict water flow at any point.\nControl your heating remotely with Hive Active Heating: Using Hive Active Heating means you can control your heating and hot water remotely from your smartphone with the Hive app, so you can ensure your home is warm when you need it to be.

  "http_www_alisonthewliss_scot/http_www_alisonthewliss_scot_alison-thewliss-mp-shows-her-support-to-end-violence-against-women-and-girls/content_667.html": "Yesterday (Tuesday 12th July) Alison Thewliss, MP for Glasgow Central, joined other MPs in showing support for The Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence (known as the Istanbul Convention). This legislation requires the UK to take measures to prevent violence against women, protect women experiencing violence, and prosecute perpetrators.\nThe Istanbul Convention Parliamentary lobby was an event run by the IC Change campaign, a campaign for ratification of the Istanbul Convention, which raised awareness about the Convention’s importance and where MPs heard from survivors. The campaign aims to secure the ratification of the Istanbul Convention (IC) in the UK.\nResearch states that on average, two women in England and Wales are killed every week by a current or former male partner. In Scotland in 2014/15, 1,797 rapes and 104 attempted rapes and 59,882 incidents of domestic abuse were recorded by the police. In Northern Ireland in 2014-15 there were 2,734 sexual offences recorded, including 737 offences of rape, and 13,426 domestic abuse crimes were reported (approximately 13% of the overall crime in Northern Ireland).\nAlison Thewliss MP said:\n“I am passionate about women’s and girls’ rights and, whilst we are making good progress on tackling violence against women and girls in Scotland, far too many women and girls experience unacceptable violence and intimidation in their day-to-day lives. The SNP has long called for the UK Government to ratify the Istanbul Convention and I urge them to do so without delay.”\nRebecca Bunce, co-director of the IC change campaign, said “This law is about women’s lives. It is easy to forget when talking about legal technicalities, but ratification is really about women being able to live free from violence and free from the fear of violence.”\nShe continued “With the promise of the Istanbul Convention, we have already seen progress from the UK government with legislation on forced marriage, psychological violence and female genital mutilation (FGM). We can’t stop now. With uncertain times ahead it is all the more vital that there is a clear legal framework to help end violence against women. We urge the UK government to finish what they started and ratify the Istanbul Convention.”\nJenn Selby, a journalist, campaigner and survivor who attended the lobby, reflected:\n“When I think of all the brave women I’ve met on my way through the system, how many years we’d all been waiting for court cases that didn’t happen, all the while deprived of our human right to adequate mental support, I wonder how many of them made it.\n“The legal framework did more to see our perpetrators walk free than to keep us alive. This is not justice. Ratifying the Istanbul Convention would end this.\n“Not only would the Istanbul Convention mean a government commitment to the adequate funding of women’s services and a stronger survivor-led prosecution service, but also commitment to prevention programmes – so the violence doesn’t happen in the first place.\n“This is a life or death situation. The Istanbul Convention is the best legislation currently in existence and it will increase our chances of survival significantly.”",

The move is expected to take effect from June 2018. People in the other postcode areas served by Victoria Road delivery office will be unaffected.\nWhilst Royal Mail have stated that the changes will not affect deliveries made to customers, those picking up letters and parcels which were unable to be delivered will have to travel around 2.5 miles over the Clyde and across the city centre to retrieve items.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“I am hugely disappointed at this decision by Royal Mail, which will cause a massive amount of inconvenience for residents in the G5 postcode area of my constituency.\n“I first became aware that Royal Mail were considering this move at the tail end of last year, and wrote to every resident in the G5 area to gauge opinion about the proposals. Unsurprisingly, the weight of objection was staggering, with over 96% of respondents stating they were against it.\n“More worrying still was the comments made by several residents who are infirm, or unable to travel. Many explained to me in their responses that they would simply be unable to make a trip to Baird Street, be it due to ill-health or for financial reasons. Whilst I welcome the promise of extended opening hours, and I appreciate that Royal Mail say they can arrange for items to be redelivered, this will not always be suitable. These measures cannot adequately replace the convenience of a local, accessible delivery office.\n“The fact that Royal Mail, in spite of the evidence presented, have pressed ahead with this plan is frankly appalling, and strikes a further blow against consumers whose essential, local services are slowly being eroded”.",

Talented runner, Kieran O’Hara, also spoke about his journey and struggles to make it to the elite level due to the lack of pathways.\nMembers of the Great Britain Para Taekwondo team provided a demonstration, and the Brighton table tennis club kept Alison Thewliss MP on her toes as they showed her how to execute the perfect rally.\nRuth Owens, Development Manager at Mencap, said:\n“It is unacceptable, that despite dedicating their lives to training, athletes with a learning disability have such little opportunity to be recognised for their talents and are unable to achieve their dream of competing in the Paralympics alongside their disabled peers.\n“It is wholly unfair that since the ban in 2000 a shadow has been cast over athletes with a learning disability. Not only do we need to see more opportunities available at the Paralympics, but this inequality needs to be addressed in the UK as well.\n“We’re hugely grateful for all the MPs and sports governing bodies that attended our event today. We hope this can raise further awareness to open up more opportunities for athletes with a learning disability to have the chance to compete and be recognised for their talents at the highest level.”\nCommenting after the event, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“I was proud to attend the APPG on Learning Disability’s event today and engage with the many talented athletes present. It was concerning to hear about the obstacles these athletes face when seeking to compete at the elite level and the event provided a good opportunity to highlight this to National Governing Bodies as well as fellow Members.\n“The event must be seen as a catalyst for action and I look forward to continuing to engage on this subject and help talented athletes with a learning disability reach their potential.”",

This will put substantial pressure on JobCentre staff and the increased travel times to this JobCentre will put claimants at increased risk of being sanctioned.\nAnswers to recent parliamentary questions suggest that UK Government ministers have no idea about the level of impact that closing these JobCentres will have on vulnerable people, with the DWP unable to tell me how many people on Income Support, Employment Support Allowance, Jobseeker’s Allowance and Universal Credit attend Bridgeton JobCentre in my constituency. I have called on the UK Government to abandon their plans to close Glasgow’s JobCentres and I will be campaigning alongside other SNP MPs to halt the planned closures.\nThings you can do to take action\n- Respond to the DWP’s consultation on the DWP’s website.

That figure drops to just 7% if they are diagnosed at a late stage.\nAlison Thewliss MP said: “I was excited to hear Beating Bowel Cancer’s plans for the future and pleased to pledge my support for them. We all need to do our bit to keep bowel cancer at the forefront of the agenda and to ensure that the Government focuses on increasing efforts to improve early diagnosis rates, if the disease is to become a rare killer rather than one of biggest cancer killers in the country, as it is today.”\nSpeakers at the reception included Debbie and Alistair Gammage, whose daughter Hannah died of bowel cancer aged just 26; Shadow Secretary of State for Health, Heidi Alexander; Public Health Minister, Jane Ellison MP; John Baron MP Chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Cancer and TV presenter, Matthew Wright, who lost his father to bowel cancer.\nHe said: “Sadly my dad died of bowel cancer so I know just how vital it is that people are aware of the disease and its symptoms. If they know what to look out for, they can get checked out as early as possible. This could save their life – but only if followed by an earlier diagnosis and quicker treatment.\n“Prompt diagnosis and treatment of bowel cancer must be a priority for the NHS if we are to save more lives.”\nMark Flannagan, Chief Executive of Beating Bowel Cancer, said: “This event made it possible for us to share our plans and outline the key policy priorities that need to be realised in the next Parliament if bowel cancer survival rates are to improve.\n“We were pleased to have the opportunity to highlight these issues to those with the power to help tackle them and are very grateful to Alison Thewliss MP, for her interest. We look forward to working with her in the future to help raise awareness of bowel cancer issues in Glasgow Central.”\nHe told those at the reception: “In the time of this reception, four people will have died from bowel cancer; eight people will have been diagnosed with it. Together we can change that. Together we can stop people dying and we can provide better treatment to those diagnosed with bowel cancer.”\nTo find out more about bowel cancer please visit the charity’s website www.beatingbowelcancer.org or call their Nurse Helpline on 020 8973 0011.\nCross party letter urges PM to scrap the rape clause\nMPs representing nine parties in the House of Commons – including the Conservatives – have signed a joint letter to the Prime Minister calling upon the Government to ‘unequivocally’ scrap the tax credits rape clause.\nThe Government’s proposals would require a woman, who has a third child as the result of rape, to justify her position to a Government official in order to avoid losing tax credits. The plan to restrict child tax credits to two children for new claimants is due to commence in 2017.\nSNP MP Alison Thewliss first identified the issue in July 2015 during the Government’s summer budget. She has now coordinated a cross party letter from MPs representing no less than nine parties in the House of Commons.\nIn addition to Alison Thewliss’ name, the letter is also signed by Andrew Percy, Conservative MP for Brigg and Goole; Jess Phillips, Labour MP for Birmingham Yardley; Liberal Democrat MP and former Deputy Leader of the House of Commons, Tom Brake, as well as MPs from the DUP, Green Party, UUP, Plaid Cymru and the SDLP.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“I am incredibly grateful to colleagues from across the House of Commons who have chosen to stand with us as part of the campaign to scrap the rape clause.\n“The fact that MPs from all the major parties in the House have put their differences aside to unite on this important issue should, in itself, send a powerful message to the Prime Minister that his Government must unequivocally scrap the rape clause.\n“I myself have already raised this issue on the floor of the House numerous times and Ministers’ responses to simple questions have been robotic at best and heartless at worst. We need to seriously ask ourselves, do we really want to be a country that summons raped women to Government offices and tell them to ‘prove it’ in order to get tax credits? Is that really how twenty-first century Britain wants to be behave?\n“I am sure that, deep down, David Cameron also doesn’t want us to continue down this precarious road to stigmatisation. The Prime Minister must therefore show leadership and today unequivocally drop plans for a rape clause on tax credits”.\nAlison Thewliss MP signs Holocaust Educational Trust Book of Commitment\nThis week Alison Thewliss MP signed the Holocaust Educational Trust’s Book of Commitment, in doing so pledging her commitment to Holocaust Memorial Day and honouring those who were murdered during the Holocaust as well as paying tribute to the extraordinary Holocaust survivors who work tirelessly to educate young people.\nWednesday 27th January will mark the liberation of the Nazi concentration and death camp Auschwitz-Birkenau, the site of the largest mass murder in history.\nIn the weeks leading up to and after Holocaust Memorial Day, thousands of commemorative events will be arranged by schools, faith groups and community organisations across the country, remembering all the victims of the Holocaust and subsequent genocides.\nAfter signing the Book of Commitment, Alison Thewliss MP commented:\n“Holocaust Memorial Day marks the anniversary of the liberation of the Nazi concentration and death camp Auschwitz-Birkenau – and is an important opportunity to remember the victims and survivors of the Holocaust and make sure they are not forgotten. I encourage all constituents to mark the day and to join members of my community in the fight against prejudice and intolerance.”\nKaren Pollock MBE, Chief Executive of the Holocaust Educational Trust, said:\n“We are proud that Alison Thewliss MP is supporting Holocaust Memorial Day. As we mark the 71st anniversary of the end of the Holocaust and the liberation of the concentration camps, it is vitally important that we both continue to remember and learn from the appalling events of the Holocaust – as well as ensuring that we continue to challenge antisemitism and all forms of bigotry.\nMP raises pensioner winter fuel payment debacle\nAlison Thewliss, SNP MP for Glasgow Central, is calling upon the UK Government to urgently review the computer system which allocates winter fuel payments to pensioners.\nA recent constituency case raised with Ms Thewliss suggests that pensioners living in properties, such as tenements and tower blocks, are losing out because the system is – wrongly – factoring in other people in the building when calculating the total winter fuel payment due.\nIn Ms Thewliss’ constituent’s case, this resulted in one pensioner only receiving half of his winter fuel payment because the system, wrongly, counted other residents in his close when, in fact, the constituent in question lives on his own. Rather than receiving the £200 payment, he only received half, which was eventually rectified following his MP’s intervention.\nThe Glasgow Central MP has written to Work & Pensions Secretary, Iain Duncan Smith, to ask for a full investigation into the system.\nAlison Thewliss, MP for Glasgow Central, said:\n“My constituent’s case highlights a serious anomaly within the UK Government’s winter fuel payment scheme, whereby potentially thousands of pensioners are being underpaid their winter fuel payments. All of this is because the Government’s system doesn’t always recognise buildings with multiple flats. I’ve written to Iain Duncan Smith to ask for a full investigation into this issue and to specifically ask for an urgent review of the payment system which seems to discriminate against buildings with more than one residence.\n“My own research shows that Glasgow alone has over 220,000 properties which comprise of flats, tenements and tower blocks. In my own constituency, over 45,000 properties are part of multi-dwelling properties. Now, of course, not all of those properties will be entitled to winter fuel payments but it does give you an idea of the scale of this problem in a city which is, after all, renowned for its red sandstone tenements.\n“Figures from Age UK show that an eye watering £3.7 billion in benefits already goes unclaimed by elderly people in the UK and I’m concerned that this is another example of older people not getting what they’re due.\n“As temperatures continue to plummet this January, we simply cannot continue on with the perverse scenario, whereby pensioners living in flats are possibly being undercut because of an anomaly in the DWP’s payment system.”\nThe rape clause – blog post\n(The below post was published in The Telegraph on 19th January 2016)\nNo woman should have to prove she was raped to be able to claim child tax credits. It’s a dramatic statement, and it’s one that has raised many questions – so perhaps it’s best to go back to the start.\nHidden away on page 88 of Chancellor George Osborne’s Budget in July was a small, almost innocuous sentence, which related to the Government’s plan to restrict the child element of tax credits and Universal Credit – child benefit, essentially – to the first two children:\n“The Department of Work and Pensions and HMRC will develop protections for women who have a third child as a result of rape, or other exceptional circumstances”.\nI read the sentence again. I re-read it. I showed it to the colleague sitting next to me. What did this actually mean? How would DWP and HMRC prove that a child was borne of rape?\nThe more I thought about this, the more furious I became. Rape is a very serious crime, but yet one of the most under-reported and under-convicted crimes there is. It exists in abusive relationships, it exists in marriage. For many women, is traumatic beyond description, and it is something they feel is shameful.\nHow vile that this Government would consider putting a woman, who may already feel extremely vulnerable, in the position where she had to confess to an Government official that her child had been born as a result of rape. How stigmatising, for that woman, for that child and for the family. Piling humiliation on top of pain is not the essence of “protection”.\nI’ve raised this with Ministers at every level of Government, including the Prime Minister himself.\nFor all the questions my colleagues and I have asked since the July budget, there has yet to be an answer as to how this will work, and particularly the burden of proof.\nThe DWP and HMRC are not known for being organisations that will take you at your word; the casework I have seen in my office gives me no confidence in either the competence or the sensitivity of these departments. What hope does a woman in such vulnerable circumstances have? Will they accept her word, or will only a criminal conviction do? We don’t yet know.\nHowever, the real problem at the heart of this is not even the rape clause; it’s the two child policy.\nFor me, it’s tantamount to social engineering. It makes children a financial commodity. It passes judgement and stigmatises.\nIt doesn’t respect the disproportionate impact on those of particular faiths or backgrounds where larger families are the norm. It’s also economic madness, as we need more children to counter our ageing population. And it runs counter to our Government’s obligations to treat children equally under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.\nThe two child policy has not yet been fully explained or justified by this Government, other than in the most tabloid of terms. I’ve heard some suggest in carelessly callous language that you should only have the children you can afford. It does not take account of the fact that you may well be able to “afford” three children when you had them, but not if your circumstances change: what if your partner dies, if you become disabled, if your marriage breaks up?\nWhat happens in the case where families come together with existing children from previous relationships?\nThe Budget claimed multiple births would be protected, but not at which stage; if your first two children are twins, will the third still be eligible, or only if that happens the other way around?\nThese questions and more have been asked by MPs since July, but answers have not been forthcoming.\nThe campaign to scrap the rape clause is gathering pace and many people are already signing the petition, which had almost 6,000 names at the last count. This should, in itself, send a message to the Government that this policy is untenable.\nI very much hope that the Government has realised the mess it has got itself into, and scrap not only this outdated and potentially damaging rape clause – but the whole two child policy itself.\nSurgery – Friday 22nd January\nThis week’s surgeries are taking place on Friday 22nd January at Govanhill Baths (9.30am) and Bridgeton Library (1pm). Constituents are welcome and there is no need to book an appointment in advance.\nIf you cannot attend surgeries and require assistance, feel free to contact me and we can make alternative arrangements.\nPress release – Campaign to Scrap the Rape Clause moves up a gear\nCampaigners against the UK Government’s proposed rape clause have stepped up their campaign by launching a hard hitting poster campaign and website, calling upon the Government to ‘scrap the rape clause’.\nThe Government’s proposals would require a woman, who has a third child as the result of rape, to justify her position in order to avoid losing tax credits. The plan to restrict child tax credits to two children for new claimants is due to commence in 2017.\nSNP MP Alison Thewliss first identified the issue in July 2015 during the Government’s summer budget.\nCommenting as she launched the latest stage of the campaign in Glasgow City Centre, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“We think the policy on limiting tax credits to the first two children is appalling and tantamount to social engineering, but to put a woman who has been raped in a position where she needs to declare that to a government official is just abhorrent. This also stigmatises the child involved, which is surely against the UN convention on the rights of the child. This proposal has no place in the twenty-first century and must be dropped immediately.\n“I’ve raised this issue on the floor of the House of Commons on no less than nine occasions – yet the Government still can’t explain how it will work and remains hell bent on pressing ahead with this draconian procedure.\n“With just two weeks left to run on this important petition, we are urging as many people as possible to visit www.scraptherapeclause.co.uk and add their voice to the many others calling upon the Government to drop this appalling proposal.”\nAngela Devine, Manager of Glasgow Women’s Aid, said:\n“Glasgow Women’s Aid is pleased to support this coordinated campaign calling for the Government to scrap the proposed rape clause for tax credits.\n“As an organisation offering refuge and support to some of the most vulnerable women and children in our city, we know the damaging effect this clause could have on women who have already endured trauma.\n“It is not uncommon for children to be the product of rape or coercive control and women should never be placed in the humiliating position of appealing to the DWP for benefits.\n“We would ask whether DWP staff will be trained to deal with sensitive disclosures and to signpost women to the correct support services.\n“Any just society has a moral obligation to care for its poor and vulnerable with children at the heart of this obligation, regardless of their provenance.\n“We as an organisation see this policy as an attempt to control and thereby undermine the already vulnerable position of women, children and young people within society.\n“We reject these changes as untenable and discriminatory.”",

I welcome scrutiny and constructive opposition, but Ruth Davidson needs to realise that being a strong opposition doesn’t extend just to Holyrood.\n“If Ruth Davidson is serious about being an effective party leader, she can’t just be the UK Tory party’s ambassador for promoting inherently unfair policies in Scotland.

The campaign is calling for a change in the law to prevent the same thing happening to other working people.\nAlison Thewliss MP said:\n“It is shocking to think that if people with terminal illnesses are dismissed or forced out of their jobs that their loved ones will lose the death in service payments that the employee has planned for and earned through a life-time of hard work.”\n“That is why I am proud to have signed the TUC ‘Dying to Work’ charter to protect my employees and I will be encouraging businesses in my constituency to follow suit and sign up to the TUC’s voluntary charter.”\n“In addition, I hope something will soon be done to ensure that every individual with terminal illness will receive the protection and support they deserve.”\nThe campaign has also been endorsed by a number of trade unions and charities, including The National Council for Palliative Care, Hospice UK, Breast Cancer Care and Second Hope.\nTUC Deputy General Secretary Paul Nowak said:\n“Serious illness is tough enough without having to put up with extra hassle at work. Everyone can surely agree that terminally-ill workers deserve protection.\n“That’s why unions, MPs, employers and charities are coming together to ensure that workers get the support and protections they need when times are toughest.”\nThis broad support was demonstrated in a recent Survation poll of over a thousand people which found that 79% of respondents support a ‘protected period’ for terminally ill workers where they could not be dismissed as a result of their condition with only 3% opposing it.",

The Home Office, which controls drug legislation, has however refused to back the plans, calling them illegal.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“In refusing to give credence to proposals for a Safe Injecting Facility, the Home Office is perpetuating the status quo for drug users and the wider public.\n“Drug use and its associated problems are a major public health concern deserving of a forward-thinking, creative solution. Proposals for an SIF are exactly that, and have been developed by those who deal with issues relating to drug misuse and drug litter on a daily basis. SIFs give those with an addiction a safer place to use drugs, where medical staff can intervene in an emergency and also look to offer support services.\n“Evidence from safe injecting facilities in other countries demonstrates that they reduce levels of drug addiction, as well as improving public safety through reducing the level of discarded needles and other items of drug paraphernalia. In 2015, Glasgow saw a 35% increase in new diagnoses of HIV among people who inject drugs in the city centre. Clearly, these figures do not suggest an improving picture.\n“Doing nothing gives little hope to those injecting on our streets and fails to reassure local communities that the UK Government is taking this issue seriously.

This year the initiative follows on naturally from the inaugural First Minister’s Reading Challenge which runs during term time, helping to contribute to a continuation of children’s reading in the break from school.\nResearch shows that reading for pleasure is a more powerful factor in life achievement than socio-economic background, and that children who use libraries are twice as likely to be above average readers.\nThe Challenge is a unique partnership between The Reading Agency and public libraries across the UK which last year got over three quarters of a million children borrowing, reading and talking about their favourite books.\nThis year’s challenge theme is Animal Agents, based on a detective agency staffed by all kinds of clever animals – furry, scaly and slippery – who are out to crack a case with a little help from their friends. Tony Ross, the UK’s best-selling children’s illustrator (including creator of the Little Princess books, illustrator of the Horrid Henry series by Francesca Simon, and books by David Walliams and Claire Balding), has created this year’s exclusive artwork.\nTo take part, all children need to do is to head to their local library where they will be given a collector folder to keep a record of their reading journey. Children that read at least six library books over the summer, will collect stickers which will give them helpful clues to crack the case and help the Animal Agents find out what’s really been going on!\nAlison Thewliss MP said: “I hope parents, grandparents and carers in Glasgow will take their children to the library over the summer to sign up for the Tesco Bank Summer Reading Challenge Scotland. The challenge is free, inclusive and makes reading fun – a vital ingredient in building literacy.’\nSue Wilkinson, CEO of The Reading Agency said: “At The Reading Agency, we believe that everything changes when we read and we know from our research how much fun families and children have when taking part in the Challenge. This year we hope the wonderful characters created for us by Tony Ross will inspire more children than ever to take part and make use of their local library throughout the summer and beyond.”\nAdele Mills, Senior Community Investment Manager at Tesco Bank said: “Reading for pleasure is one of the best ways to spend the long summer holiday so we’re delighted that over 40,000 children from across the country will get involved in the Tesco Bank Summer Reading Challenge Scotland through their local library. The Challenge aims to inspire children to pick up and enjoy reading books – something that will undoubtedly have a positive effect on their future.”\nFor more information on the Summer Reading Challenge including how to get involved and resources for schools, go to www.readingagency.org.uk/summerreadingchallenge\nFollow the Summer Reading Challenge at www.facebook.com/SummerReadingChallengeUK and on Twitter @readingagency #summerreadingchallenge",

The statement was released shortly after the responses to the Government’s consultation on the closure of the JobCentre were published, which demonstrated significant opposition to the closure proposals. 64% of the responses expressed concerns that local services in Bridgeton would suffer as a result of closing Bridgeton JobCentre and that jobseekers would find it more difficult to make ends meet due to increased travel costs to other JobCentres.\nGlasgow has been targeted disproportionate cuts to DWP offices, with over 50% of the DWP estate, including JobCentres and support offices, earmarked for closure by the UK Government. Local Jobseekers will now need to travel over three miles to attend appointments at Shettleston JobCentre – something that 79% of consultation responses highlighted as a concern in their submissions to the Government’s own consultation.\nThe decision will also put considerable pressure on JobCentre staff – the full extent of which is unclear as Ministers have previously admitted, in responses to written questions tabled by Ms Thewliss, that they do not know how many people currently use Bridgeton JobCentre.\nCommenting on the decision, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“The UK Government’s decision to close Bridgeton JobCentre is yet another slap in the face to the East End of Glasgow. For constituents who are already struggling, paying bus fares to get to mandatory JobCentre appointments will be an extra burden. Increased travel times will also put people at increased risk of falling foul of the Tories’ brutal sanctions regime.\n“Ministers have admitted that they have no idea how many people rely on Bridgeton JobCentre, and not a single Minister visited Bridgeton JobCentre before the decision was taken to close it. Now they have decided to ignore the results of the consultation and sneak out a written statement on the closures, denying MPs an opportunity to hold Ministers to account in Parliament.\n“Today’s callous decision shows that the Tories will continue to treat the people of Glasgow with contempt. I will be making every effort to bring Ministers to the despatch box to account for this poorly thought out and ill-informed decision and explain why they have not listened to the overwhelming evidence presented in their own consultation.”",

Their carers often have no choice but to use manual moving and handling techniques that are considered too dangerous for nurses to use in a hospital setting. Disabled teenagers and adults have little choice but to either sit in soiled continence products or limit their time out of the house to a couple of hours at a time.\nThe campaign is being led by Lorna Fillingham and Anne Wafula Stike MBE, who have travelled to Downing Street today to present their 51,000 signature strong petition to the Government.\nThe petition demands that Changing Places toilets be included in plans before planning permission is granted and that the facilities be incorporated into any refurbishments or redevelopments of existing buildings.\nAlison Thewliss MP said:\n“In the UK in 2018 it is unacceptable that people are finding themselves in positions where they are having to be changed on dirty toilet floors or in the back of cars. How we design our public buildings is a choice we make, and it cannot be a justifiable choice to prevent someone from accessing the basic right of a toilet. I fully support the Changing Places campaign.”\nMs Fillingham, whose own experience is of caring for her seven-year-old daughter, a wheelchair user with global development delay, led her to start this petition from improved facilities for disabled people.\nDiscussing the regulations that she is campaigning for the Government to adopt, Lorna Fillingham said:\n“This would mean a year on year guaranteed increase in facilities, it would give dignity and freedom back to the disabled community. It would mean that there would be a future where no-one had to be changed on a toilet floor. These are basic human rights, the most vulnerable people in society are being affected by a wholly preventable situation.”\nThe campaign is also supported by Paralympic athlete and prominent disability rights campaigner Anne Wafula Strike MBE, who experienced first-hand the impact of a lack of disabled toilet facilities when she was forced to wet herself on a CrossCountry train service.\nDiscussing this petition, Ms Strike said:\n“This is a very important campaign and I hope this issue is considered seriously by those in power. Law and policy affects people’s lives and it should be about giving value and dignity to every human being, no matter our abilities and differences. It is not right that disabled people and their families are continuously having to validate our existence and debate our humanity again and again over basic rights such as provision and use of an accessible toilet.”\nChanging Places facilities come equipped with a hoist, adult changing bench, toilet and plenty of space for carers which are a necessity for people with physical and learning disabilities. Despite being vital to the sanitation and dignity of a quarter of a million people across the UK, there are currently only 1071 of these toilets available, with many towns lacking a single facility. In comparison, Wembley Stadium alone has 2618 toilets.",

This is a serious decision, with profoundly significant consequences, therefore we need to get it right.\nToo much of the EU referendum debate has been distant, male dominated and, in so many cases, focused solely on the internal politics of the Conservative Party.\nIn the course of speaking to constituents, I’ve been challenged – quite rightly – by genuinely undecided voters to explain why people in Glasgow should vote to remain in the European Union.\nThe Scottish independence referendum debate was conducted at a grassroots level and in doing so, ignited passionate debate in local communities, yet too much of this debate has been so far removed from people’s day to day lives. We risk sleepwalking our way into leaving the European Union if the respective Remain and Leave campaigns continue to focus their on distant, hyperbolic arguments which bear no relation to people and the communities they live in.\nI’ve produced a short report, The benefits of EU membership to the city of Glasgow, which seeks to encourage Glaswegians to reflect on what the UK, and Scotland’s, membership of the European Union means but not just at a national level – also here in Glasgow too. Europe is not perfect – far from it. It still needs major reform and the Scottish Government has made that crystal clear. However, walking away from the table now just doesn’t make sense when we’ve achieved so much.\nIn this report, you’ll get a flavour of what Glasgow has gained from our European Union membership and how it’s helped develop and cultivate our image as a modern, vibrant European city which attracts hundreds of thousands of European tourists every year. So I hope that when you answer that question on your ballot paper on 23rd June, you’ll feel better informed as to why our city benefits from remaining in the European Union.\nDownload the report here (contact our office on 0141 552 7117 or alison.thewliss.mp@parliament.uk if you would like to receive the document in an alternative accessible format e.g. audio, large print etc).\n**CORRECTION – 17th June 2016 – in the previous version of this report it was erroneously indicated that £100 million of European Investment Bank funding was given to Glasgow Clyde College.

The Glasgow MP noted that the omission only served to further illustrate the Government’s reluctance to do the right thing by women and families.\nThe two child cap restricts tax credit payments to the first two children per family. At the same time, it forces women who want to claim an exemption for a third child – for example as a result of rape – to do so by submitting evidence and navigating a laborious administrative process.\nCommenting following the Chancellor’s budget speech, Ms Thewliss said:\n“I am sorely disappointed and exasperated that the Chancellor has missed yet another opportunity to do the right thing and scrap the UK Government’s pernicious two child policy and rape clause, which will push 200,000 children into poverty.\n“I have been pursuing the UK Government on this abhorrent policy for over two years now, and its sickening impact on women and families across the country is becoming clearer by the day.\n“On top of this, the Government is continuing to fail women in Northern Ireland who – along with third party referrers – could face prosecution under existing laws in Northern Ireland if they apply for an exemption, as I highlighted recently in parliament. The fact that these women are being forced to choose between struggling to put food on the table or going through the criminal justice system is unthinkable.\n“Clearly the Chancellor does not think the plight of women and families is an important enough issue to receive the attention it deserves. I, and my colleagues in the SNP, could not disagree more, and I will continue to urge the Government to reconsider their approach.”",

A majority of those affected travelled to the UK under the now obsolete Tier 1 (General) route; many are skilled professionals and others business owners.\nIn May, the Home Secretary, Sajid Javid, wrote to the Home Affairs Select Committee detailing that all applications falling for refusal under the character and conduct guidance of the Immigration Rules would be put on hold pending the findings of an internal review. Evidence from the Highly Skilled Migrants campaign group suggests however that decisions are still being made.\nCommenting following the debate, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“The response from the Minister today fell way short of what was required, and will give little hope to the many hundreds of people across the UK who are left with the unenviable task of trying to clear their names and rebuild their lives in light of this Home Office malevolence. I am utterly appalled by the Minister’s lack of compassion and knowledge of this issue.\n“It’s blatantly clear to me, and to scores of other MPs, lawyers and campaigners that the Home Office has made a calculated decision to pursue people in this way, using 322(5) rules in an attempt to legitimise their actions. Policies like this have no place in modern society. Indeed, this scandal is akin to Windrush part two.\n“What is particularly striking about the actions of the Home Office is that they seem to be out of step with other government departments. HMRC, for example, have said in a number of cases that individuals who have corrected their tax information have done the right thing. Similarly, a Treasury Minister confirmed recently that they would encourage people to continue to correct their returns as and when they notice an error.\n“It is incumbent on the UK Government to get their house in order here. The immigration system is clearly broken, and it’s innocent people like those we heard about in the debate who are bearing the brunt.

The training increases understanding of the needs of parents with young children or babies so parents can feel confident to ask for help where needed.

It is important that milk donors are following best practice to ensure breastmilk is free from any contaminants, but this will always have a degree of uncertainty when people are sharing milk online.\n“Milk banks provide safe and rigorously screened donor breastmilk for those babies who need it. The model used by One Milk Bank for Scotland ensures that breastmilk can be collected from donors, processed and distributed using a well-developed network, and I would like to see this available across the rest of the UK. At the moment, milk banks are often underfunded and running as a project of individual hospitals.\n“This also sits in the context of cuts to breastfeeding support projects – Unicef Baby Friendly highlighted recently that local infant feeding leads in England had reported a 47% cut in support groups, and a 58% cut in health visitors. Women who wish to breastfeed can find themselves without the valuable support and expertise they need, and may turn to online donors as an alternative to their own milk.\n“I am keen for the UK Government to work with the UK Association of Milk Banks to invest in services to allow those wishing to donate breastmilk to be able to do so locally, in a safe and regulated way, and for those requiring breastmilk for their babies to be able to access it easily. I have asked to meet with Ministers to discuss how breastmilk can be shared safely.”",

We know that tax and benefit changes since 2010 will have hit women’s incomes twice as hard as men by 2020. Women will be on average over £1,000 worse off by 2020; for men, that figure will be £555.\n“The Autumn Statement was a missed opportunity for our new female Prime Minister to stand up for women. Instead, it appears the Prime Minister has pulled the ladder up behind her.\n“As part of the continued economic offensive against women, last month’s Autumn Statement was a missed opportunity to scrap the rape clause and two child policy. It was a missed opportunity to deliver justice for women affected by state pension inequality, who are being forced to work longer for their pension. It was a missed opportunity to give everyone access to a real living wage.\n“I also pressed the Minister on the on-going tampon tax. Whilst it’s welcome that the Government is diverting VAT raised from the tampon tax into women’s good causes, the reality remains that I and millions of other women are still being taxed every month for having periods. The Government need to press ahead without haste and secure agreement from Europe to abolish the tampon tax.\n“My colleague Angela Crawley MP has been doing a sterling job in campaigning against the 4% fee levied on Child Maintenance Service payments for women and children trying to rebuild their lives after domestic abuse.

That simply is not on.\n“Like me, PCS have repeatedly raised these concerns with the DWP and no answers have been forthcoming about how this can be handled.

When I pressed the Minister, it turns out that the Government have consulted just four organisations on a policy which will cause unimaginable pain and distress to victims of rape.\n“This Government clearly does not appreciate that the majority of rapes happen within abusive relationships, and that pushing women to claim could place them and their children in a very dangerous position. During the course of the meeting, Lord Freud suggested that women should “just flee”, without appreciating how incredibly difficult that can be. This comes at the same time when women’s refuges are under threat by Tory cuts to housing benefit. That is simply unacceptable and confirms my worst fears that this is the most uncaring, heartless and cruel UK Government yet.\n“On restricting tax credits to the first two children in a family, Lord Freud made great play of the fact that 85% of families have two or less children, therefore this policy would only impact a small minority of people. He couldn’t answer why the Government is legislating to attack such a small minority. He confirmed that he had not consulted with any religious groups, who may be disproportionately affected by the restriction.\n“I was further appalled to hear that they have no intention of protecting eligibility to tax credits for families composed of children from previous relationships, which further undermines the Government’s much vaunted ‘family test’.\n“I am absolutely gutted by this Tory Government’s lack of compassion, but I will continue the fight to end to this policy. It’s just a shame that the UK Government are so hell bent on pushing ahead with this that they’ll be as obstructive as possible.”",

Ms Thewliss is backing the charity’s new campaign to improve public understanding of autism.\nAs part of the campaign, the charity has released a report (Too Much Information: why the public needs to understand autism better) which revealed how poor public understanding of autism is pushing autistic people and their families into isolation.\nAccording to a survey of over 7,000 autistic people, their families and friends, and professionals:\n• 87% of families say people stare and 74% say people tut or make disapproving noises about behaviour associated with their child’s autism\n• 84% of autistic people say people judge them as strange\n• 79% of autistic people and 70% of family members feel socially isolated\n• 50% of both autistic people and family members sometimes or often don’t go out because they’re worried about how people will react to their autism\nThis is why the National Autistic Society is calling on the public to find out more about autism so they can respond to autistic people with more understanding.\nMore than 1 in 100 people are on the autism spectrum. This means that someone sees, hears and feels the world in a different, often more intense, way to other people. Autistic people often find social situations difficult and struggle to filter out the sounds, smells, sights and information they experience, which means they feel overwhelmed by ‘too much information’ when out in public.\nIn 2015, a YouGov poll found that over 99.5% of the people in the UK had heard of autism. However, just 16% of autistic people and their families said that the public had a meaningful understanding of autism. This means that while lots of people have heard of the word autism, very few actually understand what it means to be autistic.\nThe charity has also released a short film, shot from the point of view of a child on the autism spectrum experiencing ‘too much information’ as he walks through a shopping centre. It shows how painful and overwhelming it is for the boy – and how much more difficult it is when people make nasty remarks or throw judgmental glares at him and his mother. The film concludes with the words: ‘I’m not naughty: I’m autistic’.\nThe Marshall family, whose son Alex plays the little boy in the campaign film, also attended the event in Parliament on Monday. Alex is a ten-year-old autistic boy, and he and his parents share the National Autistic Society’s passion to improve public understanding of autism.\nAlex’s mum and dad, Ben and Kathryn Marshall, said: “When Alex was filming, we were watching him from the balcony and there was a woman who gave this look, a little glance. Everybody watching with us said, ‘That’s the look!’ We all knew it. It was that split second of contempt which says, ‘why can’t you control your child?’\n“That’s why we’re so thrilled to be involved in the Too Much Information campaign and get the chance to help people realise how big a difference they can make to families like ours, by simply showing a little understanding rather than throwing us a judgmental look.”\nAlison Thewliss said: “The National Autistic Society’s important report shows why we must work harder to improve public understanding of autism. No-one should ever feel so misunderstood that they sometimes can’t leave their home.\n“That’s why I’m pleased to support the Too Much Information campaign and am encouraging my constituents to learn a little bit more about autism.\n“A basic understanding of autism could help open up the world for autistic people and their families in our community and across the UK.”",

She encouraged her constituents and the people of Glasgow to attend the roadshow and find out the steps they can take to improve their liver health.\n90% of liver disease is preventable and if caught at an early stage liver damage can be reversed. However, the alarming reality is that three-quarters of people with cirrhosis are diagnosed when it is too late for effective intervention or treatment.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said: “I am delighted to support the Love Your Liver campaign and the charity’s work to improve early detection. Liver disease is a public health crisis and thousands of Scots are at risk. The Love Your Liver roadshow is a really important campaign, which is helping people better understand the importance of looking after their liver.”\nMembers of the public were encouraged to pop along to the Love Your Liver mobile unit in Argyle street to take a free liver screener, which assesses the potential for liver damage against the three main risk factors of alcohol, obesity and viral hepatitis. A free FibroScan was offered to those who had a potential risk and those with high readings were recommended to speak to their GP.\nScotland has a significant liver disease crisis with around 900 deaths each year. In 2020, it was one of the leading causes of death in Scotland in those under the age of 75. Mortality rates are also four times higher in deprived areas compared to more affluent areas.\nPamela Healy OBE, Chief Executive of British Liver Trust, said: “One in five of us are at risk of liver disease and the numbers of people being diagnosed have been increasing at an alarming rate. Liver damage develops silently with no signs or symptoms and people often don’t realise they have a problem until it is too late. Although the liver is remarkably resilient, if left until symptoms appear, the damage is often irreversible.\n“Our Love Your Liver roadshows are a great opportunity for people to find out their risk of liver disease and receive a free liver scan to see if there is any early damage. Approximately one in five people that are scanned are advised to have further checks.”\nThe British Liver Trust’s Love Your Liver campaign focuses on three simple steps for liver health:\n1. Drink within recommended limits and have three consecutive days off alcohol every week\n2. Cut down on sugar, carbohydrates and fat, and take more exercise\n3. Know the risk factors for viral hepatitis and get tested or vaccinated if at risk\nYou can find out if you are at risk and check your liver health online by doing the online screening test at https://www.britishlivertrust.org.uk/screener\nFor more If you couldn’t attend the events you can still find out if you are at risk and check your liver information on our Roadshows, visit: Love Your Liver Roadshows",

I took the opportunity to highlight some of the awful situations that some of my constituents have been placed in as a result of the benefit sanctions regime in a Westminster Hall debate. One constituent on Employment Support Allowance, who was suffering from severe depression, was sanctioned for failing to attend a work-related interview, despite his condition making him too ill to attend the interview. Another constituent lost their Jobseeker’s Allowance for over a year after failing to attend an adviser interview – the constituent was not given written notification of the sanction and was not given details of appeal.\nHowever, the most ludicrous example of the failings of the sanctions regime is my constituent on Universal Credit who, having received a form offer of employment, was still expected to adhere to the Claimant Commitment even though he was due to start employment in the next few weeks. This case was featured in today’s edition of The National. This represents the ultimate failing of the DWP’s regime – people who are actually in work are potentially subject to sanction. I will continue to campaign for the existing sanctions regime to be halted and for a full independent review into sanctions to take place without delay.",

The campaign encourages women to take selfies of themselves with smeared lipstick and nominating another person to do the same.\nCommenting on the campaign, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“I am delighted to give my support to this excellent campaign by Jo’s Cervical Cancer Trust to raise awareness of the importance of cervical cancer screening. Cervical cancer is the most common cancer for women under 35, but the good news is attending for a smear test can reduce the risk.\n“Despite considerable improvements in the technology available to detect cervical cancer, not enough women are taking up the offer of screening. According to figures published by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, around one third of women aged 20-60 in Glasgow have not taken up the offer of cervical cancer screening within the last 5 years. There is clearly more work to be done to improve screening rates and I therefore welcome the efforts made by Jo’s Cervical Cancer Trust to highlight this important issue during Cervical Cancer Awareness Week.\n“It’s really important that cervical cancer is detected as early as possible; attending that appointment could save your life.

A majority of those affected travelled to the UK under the now obsolete Tier 1 (General) route; many are skilled professionals and others business owners.\nIn May, the Home Secretary, Sajid Javid, wrote to the Home Affairs Select Committee detailing that all applications falling for refusal under the character and conduct guidance of the Immigration Rules would be put on hold pending the findings of an internal review. Evidence from the Highly Skilled Migrants campaign group suggests however that decisions are still being made.\nCommenting following the debate, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“The response from the Minister today fell way short of what was required, and will give little hope to the many hundreds of people across the UK who are left with the unenviable task of trying to clear their names and rebuild their lives in light of this Home Office malevolence. I am utterly appalled by the Minister’s lack of compassion and knowledge of this issue.\n“It’s blatantly clear to me, and to scores of other MPs, lawyers and campaigners that the Home Office has made a calculated decision to pursue people in this way, using 322(5) rules in an attempt to legitimise their actions. Policies like this have no place in modern society. Indeed, this scandal is akin to Windrush part two.\n“What is particularly striking about the actions of the Home Office is that they seem to be out of step with other government departments. HMRC, for example, have said in a number of cases that individuals who have corrected their tax information have done the right thing. Similarly, a Treasury Minister confirmed recently that they would encourage people to continue to correct their returns as and when they notice an error.\n“It is incumbent on the UK Government to get their house in order here. The immigration system is clearly broken, and it’s innocent people like those we heard about in the debate who are bearing the brunt.

Some people in my constituency will now need to take two buses to get to their nearest Jobcentre – adding to the risk that they might be late for an appointment and end up being sanctioned.\n“As well as the severe impact these closures will have on members of the public who need to attend a Jobcentre, these closures will mean huge amounts of extra work for staff at other centres and we don’t know what the DWP’s plan is for coping with this.\n“Along with my SNP colleagues at Westminster, I will be pressing the DWP for more information on these closures and we will work hard to fight these closures tooth and nail.”",

A ‘fiscal event’ took place last Friday, with announcements expected from the new Chancellor to tackle the cost-of-living crisis. Alison Thewliss, the SNP’s Shadow Chancellor, has called on the Government to use their powers to help the most vulnerable in society. Commenting, the SNP’s Shadow Chancellor Alison Thewliss MP said: “This UK Tory Government must take the opportunity to right some of the wrongs of their previous administrations. “Let’s not forget that Liz Truss sat round Johnson’s Cabinet table and backed every decision that led to the growing Tory-made cost-of-living crisis. This statement provides the ideal chance forher to take a new tack and make a difference to the lives of some of the most vulnerable. “The benefit cap is due to cost families up to £65 a week from April onwards. This, and other dreadful George Osborne policies like the two-child limit to Universal Credit and Tax Credits, are set to be catastrophic for households as we move deeper into a recession and energy crisis. Kwasi Kwarteng is the fifth Chancellor since George Osborne – scrapping his cruel, poverty-inducing policies is long overdue. “Relative child poverty is set to reach its highest level since the 90s.

  "http_www_alisonthewliss_scot/http_www_alisonthewliss_scot_bill-published-to-crack-down-on-formula-milk-promotion/content_95.html": "A new Bill has been published today (Tuesday 21st February) which will tackle the “excessive and misleading marketing techniques” deployed by infant formula milk companies.\nThe proposed law, which is due for second reading in Parliament later this week, has been welcomed by health professionals, parents and campaigning groups – including Unicef Baby Friendly.\nThe new legislation, drafted by Glasgow Central MP Alison Thewliss, will:\n– Introduce plain packaging for all formula milks;\n– Establish a body, totally independent of industry, to test all products and verify the claims of manufacturers prior to them being licensed for sale;\n– Ban the use of misleading terms such as “follow-on” or “growing-up” formula milks;\n– Stop companies from circumventing existing laws by introducing a ban on identical packaging for stage two and subsequent products;\n– Prohibit formula companies from advertising in health journals and magazines;\n– Bring forward tougher penalties for companies who flout the legislation, including greater financial fines and prison sentences for company CEOs;\n– Ban advertising of formula milks on TV, social media, the internet and through parenting clubs.\nAlison Thewliss MP – who chairs the UK Parliament’s All Party Parliamentary Group on Infant Feeding & Inequalities – said:\n“The Bill I have published today is a major step forward in tackling the excessive and misleading marketing techniques deployed by formula milk companies.\n“For too long, these enormously powerful multi-nationals have been pushing the boundaries and circumventing existing legislation to relentlessly promote their products to parents and families. The more we see new aggressive marketing techniques, the more we see ever higher prices for formula milk, which is borne by the consumer.\n“I absolutely understand and respect that some families will choose to use formula milk; this is absolutely not about breastfeeding versus bottle feeding. I want to make sure parents are protected from misleading advertising and can access impartial, trusted information when making feeding decisions for their children. The consultation I carried out demonstrated that many parents are making decisions based on marketing alone, which is deeply worrying.\n“There have been examples of products being recalled or discontinued after they make it to the shelves, for example for being found to have excessive protein. Other concerns include the introduction of prebiotics, which may not be necessary. Without an independent agency to test these products and verify the claims being made by companies, we have a situation of self-policing which simply isn’t working.\n“Under the current arrangement, formula companies are also banned from advertising formula milks for new babies but they simply get around this by branding their products almost identically, with packaging showing stages 1, 2, 3. “Follow-on” or “growing up” milks look the same as their baby milks, so parents are led to assume there is a progression. The reality is that there is generally no need for formula after the age of one. This loophole is costing families dear, with most formulas costing around £10 per packet.\n“For too long, formula companies have been running roughshod over the 2007 legislation which is no longer fit for purpose. In addition, the consumer has been picking up the cost for an ever increasing marketing war – this Bill will go some way to ending this and ensuring that parents are free from commercial influence and pressure when making choices about how they feed their children”.\nThank you!\nI am one part of a blogging team from Glasgow called frankaboutfeeding.com\nOur aim is to support women to achieve their feeding goals. We both have turned to formula when breastfeeding has failed. We both feel that as a nation we should be focusing on helping women with feeding, with particular attention in the postpartum period. If women achieved their feeding goals then the formula industry would naturally shrink, baring in mind that 80% of women choose to breastfeed but currently only 30% are doing so at 6 months.\nThat said, I agree with most of the points raised by your bill. In particular, establishing an independent body to test products. The only thing that I find uncomfortable is making packaging plain. Too often formula mum’s are compared to smokers. We have many women who have contacted us to tell us of the guilt they have in formula feeding (remember we are talking mainly about a cohort of women who have failed at their first steps into motherhood). Yes remove any false or misleading information but don’t make women feel they are poisoning their babies. This is such an error.\nPlain packaging is neutral in terms of marketing, marketing is very clever and subtle ….it has no place in providing informed, unbiased decision making…women should not be influenced by marketing in choosing feeding for their babies.\nPerhaps you are correct, but if we apply this then ALL children’s food should be in plain packaging. This would remove any issues of stigma with formula and perhaps would tackle advertising of sweet treats etc at children.\nThis is brilliant. Well done!\nThis is fabulous – well done!\nReally good interview on BBC, well handled comments from the mum blogger and presenters. Good to see formula discussed with minimal reference to breastfeeding. The formula companies do influence parents. Totally agree that firm regulation of artificial milk and its “benefits” need to be regulated\nBrilliant!\nWhile I agree with a lot of the points above this inevitably does raise the ‘breast’ vs ‘bottle’ debate. Being a new mum who was unable to breastfeed (it was not a choice!) I really struggled with feelings of guilt and failure despite how well my little boy was doing or how good our bond had always been. The lack of information and advice for formula feeding made the situation even harder and I feel selling formula in plain packaging will only add to these issues. Yes the industry should be carefully monitored but we should be supporting all new mothers, including those who bottle feed either through choice or necessity, rather than making them feel they have failed in some way .\nI 100% agree, I am a new mum and was unable to breatfeed but can say I read this and was overwhelmed with guilt. Promoting breastfeeding is amazing and people should be very proud but using words like ‘women who have failed at the first steps into motherhood’ is absolutely disgraceful. My son is well fed, looked after and we have an amazing bond, this bill makes you feel like your doing something not good but not quite illegal. Smoking has plain packaging and this is what they are treating it as, I am absolutely furious about this, there should be more help for women who cannot breastfeed, I know there is a lot for women who do breastfeed. Breast maybe best but it was not best for my son, personally as long as your baby is well fed, well looked after and loved unconditionally then your doing an amazing job and don’t need to be told any different.\nYou are quite right. My language was ill advised and I should gave been more clear. I can only speak from my personal experience and that was that I felt like I had failed in my first steps into motherhood. I don’t feel like a failure now. I know it was the system that failed me but at first, I felt like I failed my son. My first job as a mother was to feed my boy and I couldn’t. I need to be more careful with my language and I apologise if it caused offence.\nExactly my point Amy. We appear to be comparing formula to cigarettes. This is so wrong, on so many levels.\nI was ready to come on here and stick up for formula feeding mums thinking this was another attack on them but I actually agree with this bill after reading it. Good work. Good to know people who choose to formula feed are being protected in this way. Not sure about the plain packaging though. I like to know what’s in what I feed my baby! Perhaps the Minister could also do something about the breast feeding information provided to new mums. It’s only the positives we are told about, none of the negatives. I would still have wanted to do it if I was told about the negative side and would have been more prepared for how hard it can be at first. I think many mums, including myself, would persevere with feeding for longer if they had all information available to them- good and bad!\nUp until I was 30 I had a real problem with breastfeeding. It was unnatural, weird, even perverted.\nThat’s until I had my first baby. I wanted to mix feed, I wanted to be in on the act. My wife and (independent) Midwife said no. I was being a brat, and quite frankly I was putting myself before the baby.\nMy wife struggled at first, her nipples looked like they might actually fall off, but for the good of our daughter she continued. Fortunately we found baby had a tounge tie, and one breastfeeding consultation later she continued to feed her for the next 3 years.\nAnd I am proud of that.\nI went away and read about the benefits, not just about the milk, but the process of feeding itself.\nSadly not everyone is as headstrong as my wife. Advertising works. My old marketing teacher used to say adverts don’t make us buy a product but persuade us which one to choose.\nWhich is where I was for all those years before I grew up. All those images and messages for decades imprinted on my brain. Formula feeding is just as good, only weirdos breastfeed, look at the fun they are having feeding.\nI am not surprised as a nation our heads are turned.\nIf we continue to ignore the power of marketing we are doing mothers of today and tomorrow, and our children a complete disservice.\nThank you for this bill.",

  "http_www_alisonthewliss_scot/https_www_alisonthewliss_scot_questions-on-tampon-tax-fund-transparency/content_76.html": "Alison Thewliss, SNP MP for Glasgow Central, has criticised the UK Government for not transparently advertising tampon tax funding for women’s welfare groups.\nCurrent legislation means that VAT, at 5%, is added to essential women’s sanitary products. The SNP was the only party in 2015 general election campaign to pledge in its manifesto to abolish VAT on women’s sanitary products, also known as the ‘tampon tax’.\nAlison Thewliss first moved amendments to the UK Government’s budget in September, which sought to abolish the tax on ladies’ sanitary products. However, the Government asked for time to negotiate with the European Commission on EU VAT rules.\nIn November 2015, as part of the Autumn Statement, Chancellor George Osborne announced the establishment of a £15 million fund which would be open to bids for women’s welfare groups. The £15 million fund would return to women’s welfare groups the revenue generated from the tampon tax.\nOn 26th November, the day after the Autumn Statement, Thewliss wrote to the Chancellor and welcomed the establishment of the fund but asked how groups would be able to apply for the funding. It took the Government until 4th February 2016 to reply – some 76 days. Applications for the fund closed on 22 February 2016.\nThe Glasgow MP has now uncovered tracking changes on the UK Government’s website, which only informed groups how they could respond 16 days before applications closed – some 69 days after the Chancellor announced the establishment of the fund.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“The fact that it took the Chancellor almost 80 days to respond to a genuine enquiry from a Member of Parliament is shocking and shows gross disrespect to Parliament.\n“None the less, when I received information from the Treasury, I passed it on to women’s welfare groups and encouraged them to apply for the funding. I was gobsmacked last week when we found out that there was such a quick closing date for applications to the fund, despite it taking 69 days for the Government to bother publishing information as to how groups could actually apply. This is simply not good enough.\n“I’ve written to the Treasury demanding to know the exact chronology of events on this. Serious questions need to be asked, such as who was responsible for advertising this funding, what happened between 25 November and 2 February and whether the Government proactively advertised this fund to groups other than a small article hidden away on the gov.uk website\n“It is clear that a number of charities might well have lost out on this opportunity for funding, which is totally unfair. I am therefore calling upon the Government to urgently re-open the application process and properly raise awareness about the tampon tax fund.”",

In addition, 3 million people have been displaced and 7 million Yemenis are on the brink of starvation.\nMs Thewliss’ speech focussed on the need for opening up access for humanitarian aid and food imports, which is being hampered by both parties to the conflict. She called on Ministers to secure the port of Hodeida, which has been bombarded by Saudi air strikes. On a practical level, she asked Ministers to help get cranes installed which would speed up the importing of much needed food.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“Yemen is in dire straits. Acute and severe malnutrition is resulting in innocent children dying needlessly. There have been a suspected 22,000 cholera cases in the last six months and, heartbreakingly, 63,000 children died in 2016 from preventable causes linked to malnutrition. This is a political decision; blockades by the Saudi-led coalition are preventing and delaying aid agencies from getting food into the region. Military action\n“The UK talks a good game when it comes to international aid for Yemen and it’s right to say that £85 million has been given in the last year. The UK Government is less keen to trumpet its revenue from Saudi Arms, with 143 licences granted at an eye watering value of £3.3bn. These arms are causing deaths, injuries and destruction of vital infrastructure in the port of Hodeida.\n“Yemen has been debated many times in Parliament. The time for talk is over – we need firm action now to help some of the most vulnerable people and children on the face of the planet who are seeking shelter every day from the British-made bombs being dropped on them by Saudi Arabia.\n“Without an immediate ceasefire and a political settlement, Yemen’s people will continue to be starved in a man-made and preventable famine.

I would like to thank the team at Victoria Road, and at sorting offices around Scotland, for all of their efforts and I wish them all the best over the busy festive period.\nGraeme Sneddon\nPress release – Alison Thewliss raises rape clause at PMQs\nGlasgow Central MP, Alison Thewliss, today challenged the Government’s “abhorrent and vile policy” of making women prove that they have been raped, simply in order to receive tax credits for a third child.\nRaising the issue on the floor of the House of Commons for the seventh time since she was elected, Ms Thewliss called upon Chancellor George Osborne – who was standing in for David Cameron at PMQs – to drop the rape clause now.\nThe Chancellor confirmed that the Government was currently consulting on the policy but Ms Thewliss has called for the proposal to be dropped as a matter of urgency.\nSpeaking after challenging George Osborne during Prime Minister’s Questions, Ms Thewliss said:\n“I’ve now raised this issue with the Government seven times and they still can’t justify this abhorrent and vile policy.\n“It is clear that everyone, with the exception of this out of touch Tory Government, know that the policy is totally unworkable and utterly degrading.\n“Given that the Prime Minister was not there to answer my question today, I have now written to him to ask that he personally meet me and representatives of women’s groups, and to look us in the eye and seriously justify Government officials interrogating women to prove they’ve had their third child as a result of rape”.\nThe UK Government’s “rape clause” proposals\nDuring DWP Questions today I challenged Iain Duncan Smith to scrap his ill-thought out plans to force women who have a third child as a consequence of being raped to prove this to a Government official in order to receive tax credit payments.\nAsking women who have been raped to relive such a traumatic experience and – worse still – justify their child’s birth is appalling and has got to be the lowest this Government has stooped yet.\nI’ve met with a number of women’s welfare organisations and rape crisis groups who are rightly calling for the Government to bin these ill thought out plans. SNP action has already led to u-turns on tax credit policy and I’ll be campaigning hard to make sure this policy is the next to be put through the Downing Street shredder.\nBreastfeeding Conference\nThis week I attended the UNICEF Baby Friendly Initiative Annual Conference. I enjoyed meeting with various organisations who do excellent work to promote breastfeeding. I am currently working on setting up an All-Party Parliamentary Group on Infant Feeding and Inequalities and I look forward to working more closely with some of the organisations I have met at the UNICEF Conference over the coming weeks and months.\nThe Trade Union Bill\nI met with the EIS at my constituency office and pledged my opposition to the Trade Union Bill. I believe that this Bill threatens the fundamental rights to organise and bargain collectively, as well as placing undue restrictions on strike ballots and social media communication by trade union members. #killthebill\nRefugees welcome\nI am delighted to see the first arrivals of refugees in Scotland under the UK Government’s refugee resettlement scheme. I’d like to extend a warm welcome to all of those who have come to Scotland.\nThe Scottish Government, in partnership with the Scottish Refugee Council, established an online hub to provide practical support and assistance to refugees in Scotland. I and my SNP colleagues will continue to use our influence to ensure that the UK works in partnership with our European neighbours to devise a long-term solution to the refugee crisis, which should include diplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict in Syria.\nVisit to Scottish Power’s new HQ\nToday I got the opportunity to have a look around the building site of the new Scottish Power HQ in the city centre. Amazing views across the city and it’s going to give a real boost to the local area once it opens next year.\nKeep Me Posted\nI’ve offered my support to the Keep Me Posted campaign, which campaigns for people to receive paper bills and statements from companies without charge. It is important that my constituents are able to choose how they receive important financial information from service providers, including banks and utility companies.\nMoreover, in many areas of my constituency broadband access and uptake is below the national average for Scotland. Whilst the Scottish Government is working to improve digital literacy and provide superfast broadband, the option for paper bills and statements should remain available and there should be no financial penalty attached to receiving paper statements, particularly for elderly and vulnerable people.\nVisit to Tennent’s Brewery\nThis morning I had a really interesting visit to the Tennent’s Brewery which is on the boundary of my constituency. Directly employing 500 people, they have around 7,000 customers who employ a further 25,000 employees. It was great to hear more about their plans for the future and contribution to the economy.",
  "http_www_alisonthewliss_scot/https_www_alisonthewliss_scot_mp-to-take-iranian-visas-fight-to-home-office/content_630.html": "SNP MP Alison Thewliss will today (Tuesday) meet with the Immigration Minister, Robert Goodwill MP, at the Home Office to challenge the Government’s “bizarre” decision to dramatically restrict the number of UK visitor visas being issued to Iranians.\nAs the MP with the highest immigration constituency caseload in Scotland, the Glasgow Central MP has dealt with a number of cases for constituents who have found it immensely challenging to secure UK visitor visas.\nOne such case includes the Grandmother of a baby born in November 2016. The parents of the baby, who are Iranian nationals living in Glasgow, had wanted the child’s Iranian Grandmother to be able to visit at the time of the birth. The Grandmother, who lives in Tehran, started trying to apply for her visa in May 2016 – almost half a year before the baby was due. She has still not been granted an opportunity to apply for a visa, despite her new grandchild now being three months old.\nIn a letter to MP Alison Thewliss, the Home Office advised that the Grandmother might instead wish to apply in person for a visa from VFS Global’s Abu Dhabi processing centre – a journey which would require her to cross the Persian Gulf. Another case Ms Thewliss is dealing with means that a married couple are currently being kept apart. The husband remains in Glasgow, with his wife stuck in Iran, unable to apply to come to the UK.\nJust 30 visa application slots – administered by the UK Government’s private contractor, VFS Global – are issued once a week, every Tuesday at 1pm. They are issued on a first come, first served basis. The application slots do not guarantee a visa but merely the opportunity to apply for one. Thewliss has branded this “an immigration system which appears to be run like a tombola”. The Glasgow Central MP recently secured a meeting with the UK Immigration Minister, Robert Goodwill and will press these cases today.\nSpeaking ahead of the meeting at the Home Office in London, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“Because of a bizarre policy put in place by the Home Office, I have families in my constituency who are being kept apart due to an immigration system which appears to be run like a tombola.\n“From my own constituency casework, it is clear that this approach to administering visas is simply not fit for purpose.\n“Amongst the draconian restrictions, quotas and red tape put in place by the Home Office’s private contractor, I am seeing honest and well-intentioned people being stonewalled from even being able to apply for visas, let alone visit their family.\n“During last summer, Downing Street issued a woolly press statement talking up the Government’s desire to forge greater links and cooperation with Iran. This press statement followed a telephone call between the new Prime Minister, Theresa May and the Iranian President, Dr Hassan Rouhani. One of the ironies in all of this is that the Iranian President is himself a former student of Glasgow Caledonian University, where he completed a postgraduate qualification in the city in the 1990s.\n“If the UK Government is serious about improving relations and cooperation with Iran, it could start by urgently reviewing and reforming this bizarre system of issuing visa application appointments based on luck of the draw.“",

Over 1,500 charities and businesses have signed up as partners in the campaign including Cancer Research UK, Morrisons, Sue Ryder, Sainsbury’s, the RSPCA and the Financial Times.\nIn 2015 #givingtuesday broke a Guinness World Record for the most online donations in 24 hours as people gave £35 million to good causes globally. Online donations raised £6,000 a minute for UK charities. The event was the top trend on Twitter throughout the day with more than 100,000 mentions using the hashtag. Celebrities and politicians including Stephen Fry, JK Rowling, Gary Lineker and Tom Daley backed the campaign.\n#Givingtuesday now runs in over 70 countries including the US, Canada, Germany, Spain, Singapore, Australia, Tanzania, Russia and Ireland. It is led in the UK by the Charities Aid Foundation, one of Europe’s largest charitable foundations which supports charities in managing their money and helps people and businesses give to good causes. The theme for 2016 is simply to ‘do good stuff’. Charities, businesses and individuals can sign up to be part of the event at www.givingtuesday.org.uk or connect via Facebook and Twitter.\nAlison Thewliss MP said:\n“I am delighted to support this year’s #givingtuesday campaign. It’s a great event and an exciting opportunity for charities and businesses in Glasgow to showcase the work they do all year round.”\nHannah Terrey, Head of Policy and Campaigns, at the Charities Aid Foundation said:\n“It is fantastic to see so much enthusiasm for the #givingtuesday movement from so many amazing individuals and organisations across the country.”\n“After the festive retail frenzy of Black Friday and Cyber Monday #givingtuesday is a great opportunity to give something back and we are thrilled that so many people used the day to do good stuff for charities they care about.”",
  "http_www_alisonthewliss_scot/http_www_alisonthewliss_scot_how-communities-can-help-look-after-our-green-spaces/content_688.html": "(This blog was published on the Heritage Lottery Fund’s website on 23/09/16)\nThe name of the city I am proud to represent, Glasgow, derives its meaning from the old Gaelic word Glasgu, meaning “dear green place”.\nGlasgow is home to over 90 parks (eight award winning) and gardens. That’s more than 1,900 acres of land – 25% of the Glasgow area as a whole.\nProtecting our parks and green spaces is of paramount importance to the health and wellbeing of the city of Glasgow, and many of these themes are picked up in the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) report State of UK Public Parks 2016.\nThe report notes that, even in challenging economic times, where funding for projects and services is being squeezed across all areas of government, regenerating parks enjoys widespread support, with 57% of adults using their local parks at least once a month or more.\nThe Communities and Local Government Committee, of which I am a member, wants to expand on this with our inquiry into public parks across the UK. We want to hear the views of everyone across the UK about the state of their public parks and how they can be improved. Write to us by Friday 30 September to ensure your voice is heard: contact details are on the Parliament website.\nHaving a say\nThe HLF report also notes that the management of parks will increasingly vary as local authorities seek to make savings through the disposal of land and other assets.\nI am clear that this disposal should not be done to satisfy the commercial interests of larger companies, but instead should involve communities at every stage of the parks management process.\nThe Scottish Government’s Community Empowerment Act gives communities powers to purchase surplus assets and request participation in the management and running of community assets. This means they can have the opportunity to exert greater control over their own neighbourhoods and green spaces.\nWith financial backing of the Scottish Land Fund, which supports bids for community purchase of assets, we can address some of the points made about the diversification of management in a bottom-up, community-led fashion.\nGlasgow Green\nCommunity budgeting can also play a role here and there are many successful pilot projects across Glasgow where communities have been able to decide spending priorities for services in their area, including on the creation and management of parks and green spaces.\nIn my own constituency of Glasgow Central I am delighted to have Glasgow Green, the oldest public park, containing the iconic Doulton Fountain, McLennan Arch, People’s Palace and Winter Garden. The park has benefited from over £8million of HLF support for restoration works, and from community groups who support the park’s heritage and development.\nAlongside HLF support, the Friends of Glasgow Green continue to come up with new and innovative uses for the space. In particular, I want to take this opportunity to congratulate Trisha Ingram, Chair of Friends of Glasgow Green and their members and supporters in taking the first steps to raise funds for an outdoor gym in Glasgow Green, which seeks to replace the original equipment which was donated to the park in 1860.\nThey have already raised £12,000 for the new facility and are hoping to double that amount through a crowdfunding campaign.\nMore generally, Glasgow Green benefits from being part of the MyParkScotland network, which helps people to find out what’s going on in their local park. This was one of Nesta’s HLF-supported 11 Rethinking Parks projects. Through the MyParkScotland network Glasgow Green benefits from the chance to donate securely to individual park projects. I would encourage local authorities and independent park trusts across the UK to adopt this feature when planning and managing the financial resources of green spaces.\nCitizen satisfaction\nIt’s clear from the conclusions of the report that, when local authorities and communities are both invested in protecting and maintaining our green spaces, the payoff in terms of citizen satisfaction with public parks and park quality is significant.\nIt’s also clear that, when parks are prioritised by local authorities, citizens and other stakeholders, cities become better and healthier places to live. If cities across the UK are to retain high quality public parks, then we must give communities the opportunity and autonomy to nurture and protect the green spaces they care about, and I pledge to be an “elected champion” for parks and green spaces in my constituency.\nWhile there is a lot of work to do to ensure that park maintenance and quality remains of a high standard, I am confident that Glasgow will continue to live up to its name of “dear green place” for many years to come.",

Seven UK cities were announced as part of the shortlist this morning including Birmingham, Leeds, Liverpool, Glasgow, Manchester, Newcastle and Sheffield. The shortlist was revealed on the Zoe Ball Breakfast Show on BBC Radio 2, with a guest appearance from Eurovision Song Contest Executive Supervisor Martin Österdahl, declaring the Host City race ‘good to go’! The selection of the Host City for the Eurovision Song Contest 2023 will be decided by the BBC in conjunction with the EBU, and the successful city will be announced in the Autumn. Commenting, Glasgow Central MP Alison Thewliss said:“It would have been such a special moment to see Ukraine hosting Eurovision next year. But under the current circumstances, this is sadly not possible.“It is such a proud moment to once again see Glasgow listed as a potential host of an international event. “I think Glasgow has shown itself to be the number one choice to host next year’s Eurovision. Glasgow is a unique city full of life and culture, and I can see plenty of reasons why the banks of the Clyde would be the ideal location to step in for Ukraine and host the contest. “COP26 and the 2014 Commonwealth Games brought the world to Glasgow and the city was recognised for the success of these events. The Hydro and the wider Scottish Event Campus have some of the best facilities in the UK and would be more than capable of hosting such a prestigious and adored event like Eurovision. “With Glasgow’s location, experience and facilities combined, it forms the perfect place to host Eurovision next year.”",

As politicians, we have a responsibility to consider the wider implications of the decisions we take, the causes we promote, and the impact they will have on our constituents. Grassroots sport and recreation is one such cause which I am proud to champion.\nAt a time when our local services are under enormous pressure, and demand is growing, we should look to alternative and innovative solutions to help us tackle the challenges and opportunities facing society. Sport has a significant social value, which is often under-appreciated; it can make us healthier, happier and help to create close community bonds. It can teach us valuable life-skills and it can inspire us to try new things and challenge ourselves.\nThe success of the GB teams in the Olympic and Paralympic Games highlight the depth of talent and passion for sport that we have in this country. However, without accessible facilities, trained coaches and valued volunteers, those aspiring champions and recreational enthusiasts would not have an outlet for their talents. Ensuring local communities have such facilities is of primary importance to the future health of our nation.\nI was excited to see the Sport and Recreation Alliance launch their Get Your Kit On – A Guide to Grassroots Sport and Recreation at the event today. I look forward to working with the Alliance and their members to help support sport and recreation in my own constituency in order for the true benefit of sport to be felt by everyone in the local community.",

Concerns have been raised by women’s organisations, including the Northern Ireland Women’s Aid Federation, who Ms Thewliss met with in September following her attendance at an anti-rape clause rally in Belfast.\nThird party professionals, such as doctors, midwives, social workers and support workers, can face a prison sentence of up to 10 years if they fail to disclose that a woman has been raped when completing the rape clause form – even if doing so means that women are placed in further danger of violence and sexual assault from their abusive partners.\nSpeaking after Northern Ireland Questions, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“I have been pursuing the UK Government on this abhorrent policy for over two years now, and it’s evident that the rape clause’s sickening impact on women in Northern Ireland is becoming clearer by the day. In addition to the repugnant position that vulnerable women are being placed in by having to disclose one of the worst experiences of their lives to make a claim for a benefit, they, and the third party professionals that support them, could face criminalisation under existing law in Northern Ireland.\n“The Northern Ireland Women’s Aid Federation is the latest in a long line of women’s aid organisations, charities and trades unions to join the campaign against the two child policy and rape clause. The stakes are so high for thousands of doctors, nurses, women’s aid workers and support workers who face potential criminalisation under the rape clause.\n“The Northern Ireland Secretary must now stand up for vulnerable women in Northern Ireland and ask his colleagues in the DWP to scrap the pernicious, mediaeval and unworkable two child policy and rape clause once and for all.”",

Talking Buses, which provide audio-visual “next stop” and “final destination” announcements, are essential for people with sight loss to live independently. Worryingly, only one fifth of the UK’s buses are talking buses, 97% of which are in London. For a sighted person, missing a stop is an annoyance, but for someone with sight loss, it is potentially dangerous.\nThe MP for Glasgow Central supports Guide Dogs’ proposal to make buses accessible for everyone. Earlier this year the SNP called on the UK Government to make sure all new buses are talking buses, calling it a “life-changing” move. As a result of Guide Dogs’ campaign, the UK government has acted to include this proposal into the Bus Services Bill.\nAlison Thewliss MP commented:\n“I was shocked to learn when speaking with the charity Guide Dogs how often blind people miss their stop because they do not know where they are. The Bus Services Bill is the biggest reform of buses since the 1980s so it is a unique opportunity to make sure that blind people can use buses safely too. I’m delighted that the UK government has listened and included talking buses in the bill”\nJames White, Senior Campaigns Manager at Guide Dogs, commented:\n“Talking buses give independence to people with sight loss, enabling them to travel on their own and reducing stress and anxiety. They also help other travellers including tourists and infrequent bus users to reach their destination safely.\n“The UK government have now recognised the need to roll out talking buses nationwide. We are asking politicians like Alison Thewliss to ensure they follow through and commit to making talking buses the norm across the UK.”",

That is why I am supporting Carers Week 2016 and encouraging services across Glasgow Central to think about what more they can do to help meet the needs of carers and make our communities more Carer Friendly.”\nEmily Holzhausen, who leads the Carers Week partnership, said:\n“With an ever increasing number of families taking on caring roles for older, ill or disabled loved ones, it is great to see MPs showing their support for carers.\nWhile carers have told us that it makes a huge difference when they are recognised and supported by their local services and communities, too many carers tell us they struggling to balance caring with other areas of their lives.

This is a serious decision, with profoundly significant consequences, therefore we need to get it right.\nToo much of the EU referendum debate has been distant, male dominated and, in so many cases, focused solely on the internal politics of the Conservative Party.\nIn the course of speaking to constituents, I’ve been challenged – quite rightly – by genuinely undecided voters to explain why people in Glasgow should vote to remain in the European Union.\nThe Scottish independence referendum debate was conducted at a grassroots level and in doing so, ignited passionate debate in local communities, yet too much of this debate has been so far removed from people’s day to day lives. We risk sleepwalking our way into leaving the European Union if the respective Remain and Leave campaigns continue to focus their on distant, hyperbolic arguments which bear no relation to people and the communities they live in.\nI’ve produced a short report, The benefits of EU membership to the city of Glasgow, which seeks to encourage Glaswegians to reflect on what the UK, and Scotland’s, membership of the European Union means but not just at a national level – also here in Glasgow too. Europe is not perfect – far from it. It still needs major reform and the Scottish Government has made that crystal clear. However, walking away from the table now just doesn’t make sense when we’ve achieved so much.\nIn this report, you’ll get a flavour of what Glasgow has gained from our European Union membership and how it’s helped develop and cultivate our image as a modern, vibrant European city which attracts hundreds of thousands of European tourists every year. So I hope that when you answer that question on your ballot paper on 23rd June, you’ll feel better informed as to why our city benefits from remaining in the European Union.\nDownload the report here (contact our office on 0141 552 7117 or alison.thewliss.mp@parliament.uk if you would like to receive the document in an alternative accessible format e.g. audio, large print etc).\n**CORRECTION – 17th June 2016 – in the previous version of this report it was erroneously indicated that £100 million of European Investment Bank funding was given to Glasgow Clyde College.

She also praised projects which support those affected by domestic violence, including Power Up Power Down, a joint project between Scottish Women’s Aid and the Scottish Children and Young People’s Commissioner to make sure children’s voices are heard in court cases involving domestic abuse.\nCommenting on the debate, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“Domestic violence shatters women’s confidence and undermines the lives of families across the UK. It was heart-breaking to hear stories of women fleeing domestic abuse, only to have to deal with their abusive ex-partners during court proceedings. This situation can clearly be very distressing for those affected by domestic violence, particularly when an abusive ex-partner is seeking to maintain contact with the children.\n“There is much good work being done to tackle domestic violence in Scotland. I welcome the announcement in the First Minister’s Programme for Government that new legislation will be brought forward to recognise and tackle the coercive and controlling nature of psychological abuse, which can often be hidden from sight but can be just as damaging as physical violence.\n“With the introduction of new legislation, our court processes must continue to evolve to ensure that they are providing the best possible support to victims of domestic abuse and to protect and support children who have been traumatised by domestic violence.\n“I commend the work of many support services, including Scottish Women’s Aid to promote safety and recovery for domestic violence victims and I hope the courts will consider their recommendations carefully.”",

The charity estimates that there have been on average around 3,200 cases of meningitis and septicaemia every year in the UK. They are deadly diseases that can strike without warning, killing one in ten, and leaving a quarter of survivors with life altering after-effects ranging from deafness and brain damage to loss of limbs. Babies, toddlers and young adults are most at risk, however these diseases can strike anyone of any age at any time.\nSymptoms of meningitis can develop rapidly. The first symptoms are usually fever, vomiting, headache and feeling unwell. Limb pain, pale skin, and cold hands and feet often appear earlier than the well-known rash (which doesn’t fade when a glass is rolled over it), neck stiffness, dislike of bright lights and confusion. Although a rash is often the most well-known symptom, it is often a sign that the disease is advancing rapidly and it is therefore crucial not to wait to for it to appear before seeking medical attention.\nCommenting on the campaign, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“Meningitis is a devastating disease and it’s important that people act fast if they see someone displaying the early symptoms of meningitis. It can lead to life-threatening blood poisoning and can lead to permanent nerve and brain damage, which may also lead to loss of limbs.\n“Meningitis vaccines can offer some protection from various types of meningitis and I would urge everyone to make sure that they are immunised against various forms of meningitis. I have a number of universities in my constituency and I would encourage all new students who are eligible for the meningococcal ACWY (MenACWY) vaccine to make getting vaccinated a priority during Freshers’ Week.\n“The speed at which meningitis symptoms can advance means that it is critical that more and more people are able to recognise the symptoms and signs of meningitis. That’s why I am delighted to support Meningitis Awareness Week and the Meningitis Research Foundation in raising awareness of meningitis.”\nMRF Chief Executive, Vinny Smith said:\n“We are so grateful to Alison Thewliss MP for raising awareness of meningitis. MRF funds vital scientific research into the prevention, detection and treatment of meningitis and septicaemia but there are still some forms of the disease which are not covered by vaccines so it is vital that people are aware of the symptoms. We encourage everyone to be vigilant and to get medical help if you spot the symptoms.”\nNew university students are also being encouraged to get vaccinated against a type of meningitis that has been on the rise in this age group. The meningococcal ACWY (MenACWY) vaccine is available from the GP for those who are eligible. The vaccination programme covers all 14 to 18 year olds and 19 to 25 year olds starting university for the first time.\nYou can check that you know the symptoms of meningitis and septicaemia at help to share the Meningitis Awareness Week campaign by visiting www.meningitis.org/maw2016 and using #MRFAwarenessWeek on social media.\nFor any questions about meningitis, septicaemia and vaccinations that can prevent the diseases call MRF’s free helpline on 080 8800 3344 or visit www.meningitis.org.",

Ministers want to limit payment of tax credits two children per family. The Government has designed an exemption to the policy for rape survivors, dubbed ‘the rape clause’, which will mean rape victims will need to prove their child was born as a result of sexual violence in order to qualify for tax credits.\nTory Ministers last week quietly used a negative statutory instrument to try and railroad the rape clause onto the statute books without a parliamentary debate or vote.\nThe Government has stated that it will expect nurses, doctors and social workers to act as third party arbitrators. This means that public service workers will have to judge whether or not a child has been conceived as a result of rape, simply in order for a woman to be exempt from the two child policy.\nAlison Thewliss is today invoking the House of Commons Standing Order 24 in a bid to force the issue onto the floor of the House. She has written to the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, indicating her application for a 3 hour emergency debate. Under the provisions of Standing Order 24, the Speaker will have to make a ruling on Ms Thewliss’ application from the chair today (Monday).\nAlison Thewliss MP said:\n“With just days until this policy comes into force, this Government is about to unleash utter chaos and untold distress in the public service. This will be in addition to the trauma that rape victims will need endure as they recount and relive the brutal sexual violence they experienced.\n“As it currently stands, doctors, nurses and social workers are going to be asking survivors of sexual abuse to prove they were raped in order to receive tax credits. They’ve been given no guidance, no training and no advice as to how this should be done. That is truly frightening.\n“By invoking Standing Order 24 today, I am pleading with the Speaker to grant an emergency debate on the floor of the House, so we can shine a very bright light on the horror that is about to unfold for rape victims.\n“At every turn, this Government has ducked and dived, they’ve used every trick in the book to sneak this policy through without debate. In light of the issue around lack of training and guidance on this serious matter, I am hopeful that the Speaker will grant this urgent debate.”\nThis is an outrageous, mysogenistic, sexist policy and will cause emotional trauma to the .hild involved. It is entirely un enforceable. I have trained as a nurse, midwife and health visitor and would be entirely unprepared to make a decision like this. The police and courts struggle with proving rape and prosecuting rapists even with training and resources.\nThe welfare of the child must also be considered. What will it do the the emotional health of a child to know the family finances depend on him/her being the unplanned product of violence.\nMy final objection is that, yet again, the Government are punishing those with the least resilience in society, making the poorest pay for the dreadful financial policies in the past. Let’s limit some wealthy financiers to 2 children and put their tax up if they choose to have more….. unless they are raped of course.",

This plan should be dropped immediately.\n“What these parliamentary answers show is that Ministers are totally clueless on their own plans. They don’t appear to know how many claimants receive which benefit, therefore it begs the question – what rationale is there for removing this lifeline service?\n“Even more insulting is that Ministers devised the plan from their ivory towers in Whitehall to axe our local job centres without even bothering to visit.\n“Bridgeton and the wider area is not without its challenges. We already have a great network of local organisations and services to support people including Clyde Gateway, Citizens Advice Bureau, the Credit Union, Post Office, Olympia and Glasgow Women’s Library. Bridgeton job centre is a significant piece in this jigsaw.\n“Axing Bridgeton Jobcentre would be a serious blow to local people who would be expected to take numerous buses or walk for almost an hour to their next available Jobcentre.\n“Of course, had the UK Government Ministers bothered to do their homework, they’d have known this. Now they do – and now they should halt these plans without delay.”\nSNP Councillor for Calton ward, Greg Hepburn, added:\n“The closure of this Job Centre is a damaging decision that will have a huge impact on the lives of many people in the east end. Expecting local claimants to walk for up to an hour, take an expensive and unreliable bus or to own a car is at best careless and at worst negligent.”",

A ‘fiscal event’ took place last Friday, with announcements expected from the new Chancellor to tackle the cost-of-living crisis. Alison Thewliss, the SNP’s Shadow Chancellor, has called on the Government to use their powers to help the most vulnerable in society. Commenting, the SNP’s Shadow Chancellor Alison Thewliss MP said: “This UK Tory Government must take the opportunity to right some of the wrongs of their previous administrations. “Let’s not forget that Liz Truss sat round Johnson’s Cabinet table and backed every decision that led to the growing Tory-made cost-of-living crisis. This statement provides the ideal chance forher to take a new tack and make a difference to the lives of some of the most vulnerable. “The benefit cap is due to cost families up to £65 a week from April onwards. This, and other dreadful George Osborne policies like the two-child limit to Universal Credit and Tax Credits, are set to be catastrophic for households as we move deeper into a recession and energy crisis. Kwasi Kwarteng is the fifth Chancellor since George Osborne – scrapping his cruel, poverty-inducing policies is long overdue. “Relative child poverty is set to reach its highest level since the 90s. Liz Truss must show initiative and scrap the two-child limit and benefit cap before any more harm is done. “Without action, the misery and hardship we are seeing now will grow exponentially.”",

Alison used 3.6 pence worth of energy to make her 3 pancakes.\nAvailable at no extra cost from your energy supplier, a smart meter will show you exactly how much you are spending on energy in near real time, helping you to manage your energy at home, reduce waste and bring bills down.\nAlison Thewliss MP said:\n“Taking on the Westminster Pancake Challenge was great fun and helped me with my preparations for Pancake Day! It also demonstrated how much energy can be consumed when preparing food and how costs of using energy can mount up very quickly.\n“Many constituents will find that smart meters can help with budgeting and bringing down energy bills and they should be offered the option of a smart meter by their energy provider. I and my staff are also on hand to provide advice to reduce energy bills – get in touch and we would be more than happy to offer energy saving tips and direct constituents to organisations that can help with the cost of living.”\nGreat British Bake-Off star Ian Cumming said:\n“Pancakes can be tricky to flip at the best of times, but the politicians did an excellent job with nothing dropped on the floor or stuck to the ceiling.\n“During the challenge, I kept an eye on how much energy Alison Thewliss MP was using, with the help of a smart meter in-home display. Being able to see the cost of the energy you use when you’re cooking, is key to bringing bills down.\n“With so many gadgets, hobs and ovens, the kitchen can be a real draw on energy, but I think everyone was impressed by how a smart meter can help you save in the kitchen”\nRobert Cheesewright, Director of Policy and Communications at Smart Energy GB said:\n“The pancake challenge was great fun and I’m really pleased that so many MPs from across the country have come together to demonstrate how smart meters can help households reduce their energy bills.”",

This legislation requires the UK to take measures to prevent violence against women, protect women experiencing violence, and prosecute perpetrators.\nThe Istanbul Convention Parliamentary lobby was an event run by the IC Change campaign, a campaign for ratification of the Istanbul Convention, which raised awareness about the Convention’s importance and where MPs heard from survivors. The campaign aims to secure the ratification of the Istanbul Convention (IC) in the UK.\nResearch states that on average, two women in England and Wales are killed every week by a current or former male partner. In Scotland in 2014/15, 1,797 rapes and 104 attempted rapes and 59,882 incidents of domestic abuse were recorded by the police. In Northern Ireland in 2014-15 there were 2,734 sexual offences recorded, including 737 offences of rape, and 13,426 domestic abuse crimes were reported (approximately 13% of the overall crime in Northern Ireland).\nAlison Thewliss MP said:\n“I am passionate about women’s and girls’ rights and, whilst we are making good progress on tackling violence against women and girls in Scotland, far too many women and girls experience unacceptable violence and intimidation in their day-to-day lives. The SNP has long called for the UK Government to ratify the Istanbul Convention and I urge them to do so without delay.”\nRebecca Bunce, co-director of the IC change campaign, said “This law is about women’s lives. It is easy to forget when talking about legal technicalities, but ratification is really about women being able to live free from violence and free from the fear of violence.”\nShe continued “With the promise of the Istanbul Convention, we have already seen progress from the UK government with legislation on forced marriage, psychological violence and female genital mutilation (FGM). We can’t stop now. With uncertain times ahead it is all the more vital that there is a clear legal framework to help end violence against women. We urge the UK government to finish what they started and ratify the Istanbul Convention.”\nJenn Selby, a journalist, campaigner and survivor who attended the lobby, reflected:\n“When I think of all the brave women I’ve met on my way through the system, how many years we’d all been waiting for court cases that didn’t happen, all the while deprived of our human right to adequate mental support, I wonder how many of them made it.\n“The legal framework did more to see our perpetrators walk free than to keep us alive. This is not justice. Ratifying the Istanbul Convention would end this.\n“Not only would the Istanbul Convention mean a government commitment to the adequate funding of women’s services and a stronger survivor-led prosecution service, but also commitment to prevention programmes – so the violence doesn’t happen in the first place.\n“This is a life or death situation. The Istanbul Convention is the best legislation currently in existence and it will increase our chances of survival significantly.”",

Even so, many people in Glasgow have not taken action to ensure their homes are winter-ready.\nDespite the autumn chill, a national survey* shows that more than a third of households (35%) in Scotland have not checked that their central heating is working and nearly four in ten have not prepared their home for winter by getting their boiler serviced. Having an annual boiler service carried out by a Gas Safe registered engineer is crucial as it detects problems with the boiler and controls, including whether it is leaking poisonous carbon monoxide.\nKeeping homes safe is an important part of winter preparation, yet only four in ten households in Scotland have checked that their carbon monoxide alarm is working. Carbon monoxide is known as the ‘silent killer’, because the gas has no odour or taste, and is invisible. Fitting an audible alarm is the second line of defence against carbon monoxide poisoning.\nBeing energy efficient is particularly important during the winter months, and technology can help with this. Whilst more than half of households in Scotland (51%) acknowledge that technology could help their home to run more smoothly during winter, less than a third (32%) have smart meters.\nHaving smart meters installed can help keep household energy in check, as they automatically send readings to the energy supplier. Smart meters also come with a display that shows you how much energy is being used, in pounds and pence, in near real-time, and identify where savings can be made.\nAlison Thewliss MP said: “It’s really important to keep a step ahead of winter. I want everyone in Glasgow to understand what help is available for them, and for their family and friends. Being energy efficient and keeping bills under control is really important, so I’d encourage people to get in touch with their energy supplier to find out what support is on offer.”\nScottish Gas engineer Stephen Cosgrove, who fixes and repairs boilers, said: “Winter can be a challenging time for households, but there are some practical steps that you can take, with our help, to make sure that you are prepared:\nGet the best deal\nWe have been working hard to ensure buying energy is simple, transparent and fair for customers – for every customer on a standard variable tariff they will get an Annual Energy Health Check to make sure they’re on the right tariff. This will highlight other ways we can help our customers save money like replacing old and inefficient boilers or insulating their homes for free.\nGet smart meters\nYour energy supplier will be able to install smart meters, which mean an end to estimated bills.

Find out more by visiting: www.britishgasenergytrust.org.uk.\nBleed your radiators: to make sure they are working properly. If your radiators have cold spots at the top, this means you have air in the system, so you will need to bleed them to get them working efficiently.\na. To do this, turn the system off and when cool turn the radiator key until the air stops and water runs consistently. Once you have turned the system back on, the problem should be solved.\nb. Cold spots in the bottom or centre of the radiator may be an indication of sludge build up and the need for system flushing.\nc. Bleeding your radiator may result in pressure dropping. If you have a pressure gauge, make sure the boiler is at the right pressure and top up as necessary.\nBlock the breeze: Make sure all of your windows and doors seal properly to stop warm air escaping. For those that don’t, fitting draught excluders, which you can buy from most DIY stores, is a quick and cheap way to cut down on your energy bills.\nStay safe: It’s vital to have a carbon monoxide alarm fitted and that you test it regularly.\nLove your boiler: Check to make sure that your boiler is working properly before winter sets in. The older your boiler, the more inefficient it will be. If you have a pressure gauge, make sure the boiler is at the right pressure and top up as necessary.\nInsulate your pipes: Burst pipes are a huge issue during winter months. To help prevent burst pipes, ensure all pipes are properly insulated by using lagging, which can be bought cheaply from most DIY shops.\nMaintain your drains: If you’re trying to keep your drains outside well maintained, it’s a good idea to make sure they are clear of debris at the point at which they enter the ground. This involves checking your gullies for autumnal leaves and twigs in order to ensure that they don’t restrict water flow at any point.\nControl your heating remotely with Hive Active Heating: Using Hive Active Heating means you can control your heating and hot water remotely from your smartphone with the Hive app, so you can ensure your home is warm when you need it to be.

The SNP advocates a more balanced approach to the budget which would return the UK’s finances to a sustainable path whilst, crucially, still investing in public services. Today’s Tory cuts will only heap further unnecessary pressure on the public sector. The Chancellor has confirmed a decade of austerity. It is austerity through choice, not necessity.”\nGlasgow North West MP, Carol Monaghan – a Physics Teacher at Hyndland Secondary School before becoming an MP – warned that the Chancellor’s budget is devastating for Glasgow’s young people. She said:\n“In his 2015 Summer Budget, the Chancellor announced he would be slashing student maintenance grants for some of the poorest students, and converting them into loans. Today the Chancellor also scrapped automatic entitlement to housing benefit for unemployed 18-21 year olds, which the homeless charity Crisis condemned and said would result in an increase in homelessness.”\nChris Stephens, MP for Glasgow South West, said:\n“The Tories have already cut Scotland’s budget by £2.4 billion and plan to make a further £1.3 billion of cuts by 2019/20. Welfare cuts in particular mean that 100,000 additional Scottish children will move into relative poverty by 2020. In announcing today’s budget, the Chancellor has just condemned this city and the rest of Scotland to a decade of austerity.”\nStewart McDonald, MP for Glasgow South, said:\n“This harsh Tory budget means that the Scottish Government will see a real terms reduction of £1.5 billion in the funding for day to day public services over the next four years – that is bad news for public sector workers in Glasgow”.\nGlasgow North East MP, Anne McLaughlin, said:\n“The Chancellor is cutting benefits for the disabled, the sick and the vulnerable to fund a tax cut for high earners. Just last week, the DWP announced major changes to Personal Independence Payments. It is estimated that these changes will adversely impact 640,000 people, a large number of whom are Glaswegians. However, we know from today’s budget that this has allowed the Chancellor to give a tax cut to top earners and pull hundreds of thousands of people out of the higher rate of income tax.\n“Put simply, the Chancellor is taking from the disabled to give to his pals in the city of London. The only people who are “better together” are the Chancellor’s cronies because it certainly doesn’t feel like we’re better together for my constituents.”\nPatrick Grady, SNP MP, for Glasgow North, concluded by saying the only way to firmly reject Tory austerity was to send a clear message at May’s Holyrood election by using both votes for the SNP. He said: “Today’s Tory budget reminds us why – now more than ever – we need a strong SNP Scottish Government to stand up to Westminster.\n“The best way to send a clear message to the Tories that we won’t take another decade of austerity is to vote SNP. Whether you live in Summerston, Shettleston or Shawlands, it’s got to be both votes SNP in May.”",

However, firms expect prices to rise significantly, even with the mitigation package, and many expect an extremely challenging winter. Food and drink, tourism and hospitality businesses have all struggled over the course of the pandemic, and astronomical energy bills will be the final straw for some. Commenting, Alison Thewliss MP said: “The UK Government has come up short once again in their support for businesses across the country. As has been the case throughout this crisis, new measures have been introduced which are simply not enough – while businesses continue to beg for more support. While the six-month support package may help in the short term, the long-term worry for businesses remain. “I met with several businesses in the Glasgow Central constituency during recess, who spoke to me of their concerns about the months ahead. They felt as though they are being forgotten about and left to fend for themselves in these darkest of times. The cost of the energy crisis comes on top of increased material costs, supply chain issues and labour shortages. “One business in Dalmarnock, Calder Millerfield spoke to me of their profound worry for the year ahead – with soaring energy bills hitting them extremely hard. Their electricity has increased from £160,000 to £712,000, totalling a devastating 345% rise. “They have been serving the community and employing local people for 60 years, but now face the real prospect of closing their doors for the last time. This business will be one of many businesses across the UK who face unprecedented uncertainty this winter. “The UK Government proposals are a sticking plaster on a fundamentally broken energy market. Any help is welcome, but prices are already beyond the reach of many businesses and third sector organisations. The six-month cliff edge gives only temporary reassurance – a permanent fix is urgently required. “What Scotland needs is the full powers of independence to create a wealthier, happier and fairer nation for every Scottish citizen.

Their carers often have no choice but to use manual moving and handling techniques that are considered too dangerous for nurses to use in a hospital setting. Disabled teenagers and adults have little choice but to either sit in soiled continence products or limit their time out of the house to a couple of hours at a time.\nThe campaign is being led by Lorna Fillingham and Anne Wafula Stike MBE, who have travelled to Downing Street today to present their 51,000 signature strong petition to the Government.\nThe petition demands that Changing Places toilets be included in plans before planning permission is granted and that the facilities be incorporated into any refurbishments or redevelopments of existing buildings.\nAlison Thewliss MP said:\n“In the UK in 2018 it is unacceptable that people are finding themselves in positions where they are having to be changed on dirty toilet floors or in the back of cars. How we design our public buildings is a choice we make, and it cannot be a justifiable choice to prevent someone from accessing the basic right of a toilet. I fully support the Changing Places campaign.”\nMs Fillingham, whose own experience is of caring for her seven-year-old daughter, a wheelchair user with global development delay, led her to start this petition from improved facilities for disabled people.\nDiscussing the regulations that she is campaigning for the Government to adopt, Lorna Fillingham said:\n“This would mean a year on year guaranteed increase in facilities, it would give dignity and freedom back to the disabled community. It would mean that there would be a future where no-one had to be changed on a toilet floor. These are basic human rights, the most vulnerable people in society are being affected by a wholly preventable situation.”\nThe campaign is also supported by Paralympic athlete and prominent disability rights campaigner Anne Wafula Strike MBE, who experienced first-hand the impact of a lack of disabled toilet facilities when she was forced to wet herself on a CrossCountry train service.\nDiscussing this petition, Ms Strike said:\n“This is a very important campaign and I hope this issue is considered seriously by those in power. Law and policy affects people’s lives and it should be about giving value and dignity to every human being, no matter our abilities and differences. It is not right that disabled people and their families are continuously having to validate our existence and debate our humanity again and again over basic rights such as provision and use of an accessible toilet.”\nChanging Places facilities come equipped with a hoist, adult changing bench, toilet and plenty of space for carers which are a necessity for people with physical and learning disabilities. Despite being vital to the sanitation and dignity of a quarter of a million people across the UK, there are currently only 1071 of these toilets available, with many towns lacking a single facility. In comparison, Wembley Stadium alone has 2618 toilets.",

That they wanted this callous policy to be buried speaks volumes in itself.\n“Women across the world have been marching this weekend in solidarity with America, whilst here in the UK, the Westminster Government ploughs ahead to undermine women’s rights.\n“Obviously I am pleased that the UK Government has made a number of concessions, which will go some way to reducing some of the cruellest aspects associated with this pernicious proposal.\n“I particularly welcome the u-turn on multiple births and that there will be no time limit on the reporting of rape. What is also encouraging is the decision to remove frontline DWP and HMRC staff from gatekeeping on this incredibly sensitive process. However, there are still fundamental problems with this pernicious two-child policy, not least concerning those of faith and ethnic minority backgrounds.\n“The UK Government’s own response clearly identifies that the most controversial aspect of the policy was the rape clause. Ministers even go on to concede that most respondents felt it was unacceptable for the UK Government to ask women to re-live the ordeal of a rape just in order to make a claim for benefit. Despite receiving that loud and overwhelming message, this appalling and crass Tory Government refuse to listen.\n“The fact remains that this policy, however diluted, is still anti-women, anti-family and fundamentally wicked.\n“There are still a number of very serious unanswered questions about the practicalities of a policy due to be implemented in just a few months’ time. I’ll be using this crucial time to fight these proposals all the way, particularly when they come to the House as a statutory instrument.”",

The statement was released shortly after the responses to the Government’s consultation on the closure of the JobCentre were published, which demonstrated significant opposition to the closure proposals. 64% of the responses expressed concerns that local services in Bridgeton would suffer as a result of closing Bridgeton JobCentre and that jobseekers would find it more difficult to make ends meet due to increased travel costs to other JobCentres.\nGlasgow has been targeted disproportionate cuts to DWP offices, with over 50% of the DWP estate, including JobCentres and support offices, earmarked for closure by the UK Government. Local Jobseekers will now need to travel over three miles to attend appointments at Shettleston JobCentre – something that 79% of consultation responses highlighted as a concern in their submissions to the Government’s own consultation.\nThe decision will also put considerable pressure on JobCentre staff – the full extent of which is unclear as Ministers have previously admitted, in responses to written questions tabled by Ms Thewliss, that they do not know how many people currently use Bridgeton JobCentre.\nCommenting on the decision, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“The UK Government’s decision to close Bridgeton JobCentre is yet another slap in the face to the East End of Glasgow. For constituents who are already struggling, paying bus fares to get to mandatory JobCentre appointments will be an extra burden. Increased travel times will also put people at increased risk of falling foul of the Tories’ brutal sanctions regime.\n“Ministers have admitted that they have no idea how many people rely on Bridgeton JobCentre, and not a single Minister visited Bridgeton JobCentre before the decision was taken to close it. Now they have decided to ignore the results of the consultation and sneak out a written statement on the closures, denying MPs an opportunity to hold Ministers to account in Parliament.\n“Today’s callous decision shows that the Tories will continue to treat the people of Glasgow with contempt. I will be making every effort to bring Ministers to the despatch box to account for this poorly thought out and ill-informed decision and explain why they have not listened to the overwhelming evidence presented in their own consultation.”",

Parliamentarians dressed as teal heroes, learned more about the symptoms of ovarian cancer and committed to helping raise awareness. The designated colour for ovarian cancer is teal.\n11 women die every day from ovarian cancer. Early diagnosis saves lives, and raising awareness of the symptoms of ovarian cancer is crucial.\nThe symptoms of ovarian cancer are:\n- Persistent bloating – not bloating that comes and goes\n- Feeling full quickly and/or loss of appetite\n- Pelvic or abdominal pain (that’s your tummy and below)\n- Urinary symptoms (needing to wee more urgently or more often than usual)\nOther symptoms can include unexpected weight loss, changes in bowel habits, and extreme fatigue.\nAlison Thewliss MP commented:\n“Being a ‘teal hero’ was a great opportunity to take action and raise awareness of ovarian cancer. Although there was a fun element to the event, ensuring women know the symptoms of this disease is extremely serious and I plan on continuing to be a teal hero in the future, working to ensure more women are diagnosed sooner.”\nAnnwen Jones, Chief Executive of Target Ovarian Cancer, said:\n“It has been delightful to see the MPs getting involved and learning the symptoms of ovarian cancer. Early diagnosis of ovarian cancer makes the disease easier to treat, so Target Ovarian Cancer is urging everyone to learn the symptoms during Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month this March. Our goal has been to inspire parliamentarians to become more engaged with ovarian cancer and the issues around the disease, and effect change at a national level. We are hugely grateful for all they do.”\nKatherine Taylor, Chief Executive of Ovarian Cancer Action, said:\n“We cannot fight ovarian cancer alone; which is why it is fantastic to see members of parliament showing their support this Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month. We need to educate everyone from politicians, to healthcare professionals, to women and men across the UK to recognise the symptoms of ovarian cancer. Symptoms include persistent stomach pain, persistent bloating, feeling full quickly and needing to wee more often. If you recognise any of these, be as persistent with your GP as your symptoms are with you.”\nAthena Lamnisos, Chief Executive of The Eve Appeal, said:\n“With ovarian cancer it’s about knowing the signs and symptoms so that you can avoid the trauma of a late diagnosis and the grim statistics that go with Stage 3 and 4 disease. That’s why The Eve Appeal know it’s vital to have open conversations about your health and know the signs and symptoms of all the women-specific cancers. With ovarian cancer especially the signs might not automatically lead either a woman or her GP to immediately think of cancer and that’s why arming yourself with information can literally be a life-saver.”\nVictoria Clare, Chief Executive of Ovacome, said:\n“It is great to see so many MPs getting involved in raising awareness of the symptoms of ovarian cancer. By working together to raise awareness we really will make progress in detecting and treating the disease. The women we support are always pleased to see those with influence supporting them and thank you so much to all the MPs who have done so this year.”",

The Home Office, which controls drug legislation, has however refused to back the plans, calling them illegal.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“In refusing to give credence to proposals for a Safe Injecting Facility, the Home Office is perpetuating the status quo for drug users and the wider public.\n“Drug use and its associated problems are a major public health concern deserving of a forward-thinking, creative solution. Proposals for an SIF are exactly that, and have been developed by those who deal with issues relating to drug misuse and drug litter on a daily basis. SIFs give those with an addiction a safer place to use drugs, where medical staff can intervene in an emergency and also look to offer support services.\n“Evidence from safe injecting facilities in other countries demonstrates that they reduce levels of drug addiction, as well as improving public safety through reducing the level of discarded needles and other items of drug paraphernalia. In 2015, Glasgow saw a 35% increase in new diagnoses of HIV among people who inject drugs in the city centre. Clearly, these figures do not suggest an improving picture.\n“Doing nothing gives little hope to those injecting on our streets and fails to reassure local communities that the UK Government is taking this issue seriously. I fully support the Scottish Government’s calls to have drugs law devolved. Failure to do so it seems will let down those who clearly need support”.",

So much of this work goes totally unrecognised and happens under the radar, but it is vital in supporting vulnerable women in Glasgow from all kinds of backgrounds.\n“Getting the opportunity to spend some time with the staff at the centre this week was hugely valuable in terms of getting an insight into the complex challenges they face in supporting women through unimaginably horrific situations.\n“It’s a bittersweet moment to celebrate forty years of an organisation that shouldn’t have to exist in this day and age. However, the figures show that too many rapes still go unreported and the conviction rate is still far, far too low. We need to remember that, although the majority – 97% – of rape cases don’t result in conviction, it’s still absolutely imperative the survivors of rape and sexual abuse are given sensitive and confidential support as they try to rebuild their lives.\n“The work that Rape Crisis staff and volunteers do from their Support to Report project right down to their first response helpline is absolutely vital, and I very much look forward to taking forward a number of issues they raised with me to day which I, in turn, will be taking up with the Scottish and UK Governments.”",

The DWP are not known for taking people’s word on a range of issues and I don’t have any confidence that they will be able to treat women sensitively.\n“We still don’t know what the regulations will look like but my caseload shows evidence of some poor decision making and cases later being overturned. If this was to be the case for a woman who has been the victim of abuse and rape, this will only add to the trauma and indignity of her experience.\n“The more this issue rumbles on, the more convinced I am that both the two child policy and rape clause are completely unworkable. This isn’t about point scoring or getting one-up over the Government – it’s about doing what’s right and ditching a proposal that has the potential to cause enormous distress to vulnerable women.”",

She also praised projects which support those affected by domestic violence, including Power Up Power Down, a joint project between Scottish Women’s Aid and the Scottish Children and Young People’s Commissioner to make sure children’s voices are heard in court cases involving domestic abuse.\nCommenting on the debate, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“Domestic violence shatters women’s confidence and undermines the lives of families across the UK. It was heart-breaking to hear stories of women fleeing domestic abuse, only to have to deal with their abusive ex-partners during court proceedings. This situation can clearly be very distressing for those affected by domestic violence, particularly when an abusive ex-partner is seeking to maintain contact with the children.\n“There is much good work being done to tackle domestic violence in Scotland. I welcome the announcement in the First Minister’s Programme for Government that new legislation will be brought forward to recognise and tackle the coercive and controlling nature of psychological abuse, which can often be hidden from sight but can be just as damaging as physical violence.\n“With the introduction of new legislation, our court processes must continue to evolve to ensure that they are providing the best possible support to victims of domestic abuse and to protect and support children who have been traumatised by domestic violence.\n“I commend the work of many support services, including Scottish Women’s Aid to promote safety and recovery for domestic violence victims and I hope the courts will consider their recommendations carefully.”",

We know that our children are eating too much sugar, with their main source being sugar sweetened soft drinks which is contributing to more than one third of our kids being overweight or obese by the time they leave primary school. Added to this children from deprived areas of the UK are twice as likely to be overweight or obese as their counterparts from less deprived areas, whilst more likely to consume sugar sweetened soft drinks.\nObese children are five times more likely to become obese adults, increasing their risk of developing serious health conditions like type 2 diabetes, cancer, liver and cardiovascular disease and associated mental health problems. Obesity also currently costs the NHS at least £6billion a year.\nAlison Thewliss MP said: “We have a childhood obesity crisis in this country. It’s unbelievable how much sugar is in many of the drinks our children regularly consume. These drinks easily become part of their regular diet and usually have no nutritional value so just end up being empty calories.\n“This is why the Soft Drinks Industry Levy is so important. Decreasing the amount of sugar in these beverages will contribute towards making our children healthier now, and in the future.”\nProfessor John Wass from the Obesity Health Alliance said: “Our children are consuming too much sugar and soft drinks are their number one source of sugar. “The case for the soft drinks industry levy, coupled with the reformulation of soft drinks to reduce their sugar content, has never been clearer. The nation’s diet needs to be unsweetened – and fast.”",

Concerns have been raised by women’s organisations, including the Northern Ireland Women’s Aid Federation, who Ms Thewliss met with in September following her attendance at an anti-rape clause rally in Belfast.\nThird party professionals, such as doctors, midwives, social workers and support workers, can face a prison sentence of up to 10 years if they fail to disclose that a woman has been raped when completing the rape clause form – even if doing so means that women are placed in further danger of violence and sexual assault from their abusive partners.\nSpeaking after Northern Ireland Questions, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“I have been pursuing the UK Government on this abhorrent policy for over two years now, and it’s evident that the rape clause’s sickening impact on women in Northern Ireland is becoming clearer by the day. In addition to the repugnant position that vulnerable women are being placed in by having to disclose one of the worst experiences of their lives to make a claim for a benefit, they, and the third party professionals that support them, could face criminalisation under existing law in Northern Ireland.\n“The Northern Ireland Women’s Aid Federation is the latest in a long line of women’s aid organisations, charities and trades unions to join the campaign against the two child policy and rape clause. The stakes are so high for thousands of doctors, nurses, women’s aid workers and support workers who face potential criminalisation under the rape clause.\n“The Northern Ireland Secretary must now stand up for vulnerable women in Northern Ireland and ask his colleagues in the DWP to scrap the pernicious, mediaeval and unworkable two child policy and rape clause once and for all.”",

That figure drops to just 7% if they are diagnosed at a late stage.\nAlison Thewliss MP said: “I was excited to hear Beating Bowel Cancer’s plans for the future and pleased to pledge my support for them. We all need to do our bit to keep bowel cancer at the forefront of the agenda and to ensure that the Government focuses on increasing efforts to improve early diagnosis rates, if the disease is to become a rare killer rather than one of biggest cancer killers in the country, as it is today.”\nSpeakers at the reception included Debbie and Alistair Gammage, whose daughter Hannah died of bowel cancer aged just 26; Shadow Secretary of State for Health, Heidi Alexander; Public Health Minister, Jane Ellison MP; John Baron MP Chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Cancer and TV presenter, Matthew Wright, who lost his father to bowel cancer.\nHe said: “Sadly my dad died of bowel cancer so I know just how vital it is that people are aware of the disease and its symptoms. If they know what to look out for, they can get checked out as early as possible. This could save their life – but only if followed by an earlier diagnosis and quicker treatment.\n“Prompt diagnosis and treatment of bowel cancer must be a priority for the NHS if we are to save more lives.”\nMark Flannagan, Chief Executive of Beating Bowel Cancer, said: “This event made it possible for us to share our plans and outline the key policy priorities that need to be realised in the next Parliament if bowel cancer survival rates are to improve.\n“We were pleased to have the opportunity to highlight these issues to those with the power to help tackle them and are very grateful to Alison Thewliss MP, for her interest. We look forward to working with her in the future to help raise awareness of bowel cancer issues in Glasgow Central.”\nHe told those at the reception: “In the time of this reception, four people will have died from bowel cancer; eight people will have been diagnosed with it.

Mr Jenrick made the claim that no refugees are housed in Scotland, and a further claim that no asylum seekers are housed in Scotland. Given the opportunity to correct this demonstrably false statement on the record, he declined.\nThis conduct is of the utmost seriousness. The UK Government’s ministerial code states: “It is of paramount importance that ministers give accurate and truthful information to parliament, correcting any inadvertent error at the earliest opportunity. Ministers who knowingly mislead parliament will be expected to offer their resignation to the Prime Minister.”\nHome Office data from 2020 to 2021 published last year showed Scotland took in around 13% of all refugees resettled in the UK during that period – well above our proportion of the UK’s population of 8%.\nThe Home Office’s most recent quarterly figures show Glasgow remains the local authority with the most dispersed asylum seekers (70 per 10,000 residents), followed by Birmingham (17 per 10,000), and Hillingdon (18 per 10,000).\nScotland has also taken in 20% of all Ukrainian arrivals under the Homes for Ukrainian scheme and the Scottish Government Super Sponsor scheme.\nFollowing the crisis in Syria in 2015, Scottish local authorities welcomed asylum seekers and by early 2020 there were over 3500 individuals in all 32 of Scotland’s local authority areas, under the Syrian Resettlement programme and the Vulnerable Children’s Resettlement Scheme.\nMr Jenrick’s conduct has not only breached the Ministerial Code, but caused great offence to communities in Scotland.\nThe Scottish Refugee Council were unequivocal in their condemnation of Mr Jenrick’s actions:\n“We are truly shocked by the wild inaccuracies shared here by immigration minister Robert Jenrick. The minister is either knowingly lying or is not aware that Scotland welcomes thousands of people seeking sanctuary each year. We are not sure which is more concerning. With the proposal of the inhumane Illegal Migration Bill and the increase in far-right rhetoric, including from the UK government, it is vital that we call out these blatant falsehoods.”\nI urge you to consider the Minister’s position.",

The training aims to raise awareness of the challenges people with Parkinson’s face.\nThe push for greater awareness is part of the charity’s activity to encourage people to Unite for Parkinson’s on World Parkinson’s Day, as a survey found that 32 per cent of people with Parkinson’s have been stared at in public and 11 per cent have been laughed at.

The UK Government claims that these changes would reduce spending on disability benefits by £3.7 billion. In reality, the changes will deny over 160,000 people access to Personal Independence Payment, cutting vital support which helps people cope with the extra costs of living with disability.\nThese changes come on the back of the comments made by Tory MP and head of the Number 10 Policy Unit George Freeman, who said that the changes would ensure that benefits went to people who are “really disabled” rather than people “who suffer from anxiety”. Mr Freeman’s comments have drawn criticism from disability rights organisations for the insensitive way that he portrayed sufferers of anxiety.\nCommenting on the legislation, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“For a Tory MP, and one of Theresa May’s most senior advisers, to suggest that people with a mental health condition are not “really disabled” is completely unacceptable and wrong. George Freeman’s words highlight this Tory government’s total lack of understanding or compassion when it comes to providing for those who are less fortunate than others.\n“The Tories said there would be no further cuts to disability support during this parliament, but once again they have shown that the price of their failed austerity project is to be borne by those who are least able to afford it.\n“The UK government must urgently clarify what these new proposals will mean for people who currently receive Personal Independence Payment and give a concrete assurance that any changes will not result in a reduction in financial support for disabled people.\n“I have signed the “prayer” motion laid down in the House of Commons to formally object to this legislation and I call on MPs from across the House of Commons to unite in opposition against these changes.”",

Minister are now unleashing untold chaos and poverty for some of the most vulnerable women and families in this country – indeed, the very “just about managing” families Theresa May spoke about upon taking office as Prime Minister.\n“As of midnight last night, a two child limit on child tax credits and universal credit – which is tantamount to social engineering – came into force. It largely penalises families who are already in work, so this has very little to do with reducing the welfare bill but is, instead, an ideological attack on the lowest earning families in our society.\n“Independent analysis shows that the two child limit alone will mean a loss of up to £2,800 every year per child for hardworking families. If you had a third child at 11.59pm last night, over the next 18 years you could be £50,000 better off than a family whose third child was born a minute later.\n“Analysis also shows that well over 200,000 children will now move into relative poverty as a result of this deeply flawed two child limit. We should be reducing child poverty, not adding hundreds of thousands more to this miserable statistic.\n“What’s most horrifying is the rape clause, which is a vile policy in total chaos. Ministers are willing to give an exemption to those women whose third child was conceived as a result of rape, but they want them to prove this in a traumatic assessment from healthcare professionals and social workers. This is utterly appalling and will only seek to make rape survivors relive the trauma and brutality of the sexual violence they experienced at the hands of their perpetrator. It must be one of the most inhumane and barbaric policies ever to emanate from Whitehall.\n“The rape clause has been found, even today, as being totally unworkable, with wholly inadequate guidance sneaked out during the night. There has been no proper sexual violence awareness training for healthcare professionals and social workers who’ve been asked to arbitrate on whether a woman’s child was conceived as a result of rape.\n“Ministers have ducked and dived at every turn to try and avoid talking about this policy, presumably because they know it’s so unpalatable. The UK government railroaded this through Parliament using a statutory instrument which meant MPs couldn’t vote upon or debate it. It’s all well and good that the UK government has now conceded that this will need to be referred to a Delegated Legislation Committee when Parliament returns after the Easter recess. However, the fact remains, the policy is now live and will cause untold distress. The UK government must step in today and suspend this right now before serious damage is done.”\n1 thought on “Two child policy and rape clause comes into force”",

This demonstrated a blatant ignorance of the dehumanising nature of domestic and sexual abuse.\n“The 2015 budget document suggested that the DWP would develop “protections” for women with more than two children, when that third child was conceived as a result of rape. Despite pressing Lord Freud on this, it was clear the Government don’t really know in practice how such a policy would work.\n“For example, would a woman have to prove that she had conceived a child as a result of rape? If so, who would arbitrate on that? Would that information be retained on her DWP files? If so, would all and any DWP staff be able to access that information?\n“It was suggested by the Government during the meeting that a letter be issued to survivors of rape which they could keep to prove they were exempt from the two child policy and could be presented as and when required. Does the UK Government genuinely think this is appropriate?\n“One question this Government can’t answer is how limiting tax credits to two children per family fits in with its family test for policy. Put simply, this policy is anti-family and will stigmatise children.\n“I’ve already had conversations with faith leaders who believe that this policy would directly discriminate families who, for religious reasons, might have larger families.\n“There are just far too many unanswered questions and concerns around this policy; the Government wrote to me and confirmed that they still hadn’t figured out the detail of how their plans could be implemented.\n“Theresa May’s new Government hasn’t been shy about making policy u-turns and ditching some of David Cameron and George Osborne’s prized policies. The rape clause and two child policy should be next to be thrown onto this new Government’s bonfire and I’m giving Ministers that very opportunity today, when they can come to the chamber and scrap these wicked plans.”",

  "http_www_alisonthewliss_scot/https_www_alisonthewliss_scot_snp-mp-calls-for-more-guidance-on-breastmilk-sharing/content_122.html": "Alison Thewliss, SNP MP for Glasgow Central, has urged the UK Government to offer guidance on milk sharing – a practice that thousands of women are already participating in through online networks across the country.\nMilk sharing has become an increasingly popular method for mothers to get access to breastmilk for their babies, particularly amongst those who have encountered difficulties when breastfeeding.\nThe sharing of breastmilk online is unregulated and some experts are concerned that without NHS supervision or Government guidance, there is a chance that the practice could spread infection and viruses.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“There is a growing recognition of the unique qualities of breastmilk, and the growth of milk sharing online is to some degree a symptom of this. It is important that milk donors are following best practice to ensure breastmilk is free from any contaminants, but this will always have a degree of uncertainty when people are sharing milk online.\n“Milk banks provide safe and rigorously screened donor breastmilk for those babies who need it. The model used by One Milk Bank for Scotland ensures that breastmilk can be collected from donors, processed and distributed using a well-developed network, and I would like to see this available across the rest of the UK. At the moment, milk banks are often underfunded and running as a project of individual hospitals.\n“This also sits in the context of cuts to breastfeeding support projects – Unicef Baby Friendly highlighted recently that local infant feeding leads in England had reported a 47% cut in support groups, and a 58% cut in health visitors. Women who wish to breastfeed can find themselves without the valuable support and expertise they need, and may turn to online donors as an alternative to their own milk.\n“I am keen for the UK Government to work with the UK Association of Milk Banks to invest in services to allow those wishing to donate breastmilk to be able to do so locally, in a safe and regulated way, and for those requiring breastmilk for their babies to be able to access it easily. I have asked to meet with Ministers to discuss how breastmilk can be shared safely.”",

According to the report, the Committee have “cast doubt as to whether the system will be fully set up by 6 April, when the legislation takes effect, and on whether the exception relating to non-consensual conception can ever be made to work.”\nMembers of the Committee have also rounded on the DWP’s inadequate provision of training for the rape clause third party reporting mechanism, saying that the DWP “takes no account of the training that may be necessary for the assessors eventually chosen.”\nThis shocking criticism highlights the poor preparations that Tory Ministers have put in place for the policy, with no training offered for the hundreds of thousands of nurses, doctors and social workers who will be expected to judge whether or not a woman’s child has been conceived as a result of rape.\nCommenting on the report, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“With just days left until the two child policy and rape clause comes into force, the House of Lords’ Delegated Legislation Committee have highlighted a raft of serious flaws that are embedded within this pernicious and medieval policy.\n“The cruelty of expecting benefit claimants to have to re-live the ordeal of a rape in order to access their benefits to help pay the bills and feed their family is undeniable. This report could not be any clearer – Tory Ministers’ plans for the two child policy and rape clause will not work, forcing vulnerable women to relive the ordeal of rape just to claim a benefit.\n“With time ticking away, Ministers must now wake up to the warnings that the two child policy and rape clause are ill-thought-out and that they will cause unbearable hardship to families. It’s not too late for the UK Government to change tack and ditch this unworkable and medieval policy and I urge Ministers to do so now.”",

  "http_www_alisonthewliss_scot/https_www_alisonthewliss_scot_author_admin_page_2/content_55.html": "(The below post was published in The Telegraph on 19th January 2016)\nNo woman should have to prove she was raped to be able to claim child tax credits. It’s a dramatic statement, and it’s one that has raised many questions – so perhaps it’s best to go back to the start.\nHidden away on page 88 of Chancellor George Osborne’s Budget in July was a small, almost innocuous sentence, which related to the Government’s plan to restrict the child element of tax credits and Universal Credit – child benefit, essentially – to the first two children:\n“The Department of Work and Pensions and HMRC will develop protections for women who have a third child as a result of rape, or other exceptional circumstances”.\nI read the sentence again. I re-read it. I showed it to the colleague sitting next to me. What did this actually mean? How would DWP and HMRC prove that a child was borne of rape?\nThe more I thought about this, the more furious I became. Rape is a very serious crime, but yet one of the most under-reported and under-convicted crimes there is. It exists in abusive relationships, it exists in marriage. For many women, is traumatic beyond description, and it is something they feel is shameful.\nHow vile that this Government would consider putting a woman, who may already feel extremely vulnerable, in the position where she had to confess to an Government official that her child had been born as a result of rape. How stigmatising, for that woman, for that child and for the family. Piling humiliation on top of pain is not the essence of “protection”.\nI’ve raised this with Ministers at every level of Government, including the Prime Minister himself.\nFor all the questions my colleagues and I have asked since the July budget, there has yet to be an answer as to how this will work, and particularly the burden of proof.\nThe DWP and HMRC are not known for being organisations that will take you at your word; the casework I have seen in my office gives me no confidence in either the competence or the sensitivity of these departments. What hope does a woman in such vulnerable circumstances have? Will they accept her word, or will only a criminal conviction do? We don’t yet know.\nHowever, the real problem at the heart of this is not even the rape clause; it’s the two child policy.\nFor me, it’s tantamount to social engineering. It makes children a financial commodity. It passes judgement and stigmatises.\nIt doesn’t respect the disproportionate impact on those of particular faiths or backgrounds where larger families are the norm. It’s also economic madness, as we need more children to counter our ageing population. And it runs counter to our Government’s obligations to treat children equally under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.\nThe two child policy has not yet been fully explained or justified by this Government, other than in the most tabloid of terms. I’ve heard some suggest in carelessly callous language that you should only have the children you can afford. It does not take account of the fact that you may well be able to “afford” three children when you had them, but not if your circumstances change: what if your partner dies, if you become disabled, if your marriage breaks up?\nWhat happens in the case where families come together with existing children from previous relationships?\nThe Budget claimed multiple births would be protected, but not at which stage; if your first two children are twins, will the third still be eligible, or only if that happens the other way around?\nThese questions and more have been asked by MPs since July, but answers have not been forthcoming.\nThe campaign to scrap the rape clause is gathering pace and many people are already signing the petition, which had almost 6,000 names at the last count. This should, in itself, send a message to the Government that this policy is untenable.\nI very much hope that the Government has realised the mess it has got itself into, and scrap not only this outdated and potentially damaging rape clause – but the whole two child policy itself.",

With the interactive game, Guide Dogs Scotland raised awareness of their Streets Ahead campaign to keep streets free from clutter.\nStreet clutter, such as pavement parked cars, shop advertising boards and wheelie bins, is a real blight on the streetscape and a major problem for pedestrians. It is particularly dangerous for people with visual impairments, parents with pushchairs, wheelchair users and other disabled people.\nAccording to a Guide Dogs survey, 98% of people with a vision impairment in Scotland encountered obstacles on the pavement and 88% of them have had problems with pavement parked cars specifically. Guide Dogs Scotland campaigns against problem pavement parking to make sure that blind and partially sighted people can get out and about independently.\nAlison Thewliss MP commented:\n“Our streets must be accessible to all our citizens and I am delighted to give my support to Guide Dogs Scotland in their campaign to tackle street clutter. The SNP in government have already taken action to tackle the most common obstacles facing blind and visually impaired people – including significant changes to the commercial bin arrangements in Glasgow which will see a reduction in the visibility of large commercial bins, thereby reducing clutter and making the city’s streets more attractive for everyone.\n“I regularly receive complaints from my constituents about inconsiderate parking and I am hopeful that the SNP Scottish Government will adopt the proposals put forward by my colleague Sandra White MSP to ban unsafe pavement parking, thereby making the streets safer for all but especially those who are blind and visually impaired and rely on clear, obstacle-free pavements to navigate through everyday life.”\nNiall Foley, Engagement Manager at Guide Dogs Scotland, commented:\n“It is terrifying for someone who cannot see oncoming traffic or has small children with them to take the risk of stepping out into a road because of cars parked on the pavement. Everyone should be able to walk the streets without fear.\n“We welcome Transport Scotland’s work on a law to curb unsafe pavement parking and are looking forward to seeing a prohibition of unsafe pavement parking as part of the Transport Bill in the near future.”",

We know that tax and benefit changes since 2010 will have hit women’s incomes twice as hard as men by 2020. Women will be on average over £1,000 worse off by 2020; for men, that figure will be £555.\n“The Autumn Statement was a missed opportunity for our new female Prime Minister to stand up for women. Instead, it appears the Prime Minister has pulled the ladder up behind her.\n“As part of the continued economic offensive against women, last month’s Autumn Statement was a missed opportunity to scrap the rape clause and two child policy. It was a missed opportunity to deliver justice for women affected by state pension inequality, who are being forced to work longer for their pension. It was a missed opportunity to give everyone access to a real living wage.\n“I also pressed the Minister on the on-going tampon tax. Whilst it’s welcome that the Government is diverting VAT raised from the tampon tax into women’s good causes, the reality remains that I and millions of other women are still being taxed every month for having periods. The Government need to press ahead without haste and secure agreement from Europe to abolish the tampon tax.\n“My colleague Angela Crawley MP has been doing a sterling job in campaigning against the 4% fee levied on Child Maintenance Service payments for women and children trying to rebuild their lives after domestic abuse. The Prime Minister must respond to legitimate calls for the Government to axe this cruel tax on child support payments.”",
  "http_www_alisonthewliss_scot/http_www_alisonthewliss_scot_alison-thewliss-mp-is-supporting-meningitis-awareness-week/content_612.html": "Alison Thewliss MP is helping to raise awareness of meningitis in Glasgow Central during national Meningitis Awareness Week (19-25 September 2016) to ensure that people are aware of the symptoms, know to be vigilant and act fast.\nMeningitis Awareness Week is run by Meningitis Research Foundation (MRF). The charity estimates that there have been on average around 3,200 cases of meningitis and septicaemia every year in the UK. They are deadly diseases that can strike without warning, killing one in ten, and leaving a quarter of survivors with life altering after-effects ranging from deafness and brain damage to loss of limbs. Babies, toddlers and young adults are most at risk, however these diseases can strike anyone of any age at any time.\nSymptoms of meningitis can develop rapidly. The first symptoms are usually fever, vomiting, headache and feeling unwell. Limb pain, pale skin, and cold hands and feet often appear earlier than the well-known rash (which doesn’t fade when a glass is rolled over it), neck stiffness, dislike of bright lights and confusion. Although a rash is often the most well-known symptom, it is often a sign that the disease is advancing rapidly and it is therefore crucial not to wait to for it to appear before seeking medical attention.\nCommenting on the campaign, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“Meningitis is a devastating disease and it’s important that people act fast if they see someone displaying the early symptoms of meningitis. It can lead to life-threatening blood poisoning and can lead to permanent nerve and brain damage, which may also lead to loss of limbs.\n“Meningitis vaccines can offer some protection from various types of meningitis and I would urge everyone to make sure that they are immunised against various forms of meningitis. I have a number of universities in my constituency and I would encourage all new students who are eligible for the meningococcal ACWY (MenACWY) vaccine to make getting vaccinated a priority during Freshers’ Week.\n“The speed at which meningitis symptoms can advance means that it is critical that more and more people are able to recognise the symptoms and signs of meningitis. That’s why I am delighted to support Meningitis Awareness Week and the Meningitis Research Foundation in raising awareness of meningitis.”\nMRF Chief Executive, Vinny Smith said:\n“We are so grateful to Alison Thewliss MP for raising awareness of meningitis. MRF funds vital scientific research into the prevention, detection and treatment of meningitis and septicaemia but there are still some forms of the disease which are not covered by vaccines so it is vital that people are aware of the symptoms. We encourage everyone to be vigilant and to get medical help if you spot the symptoms.”\nNew university students are also being encouraged to get vaccinated against a type of meningitis that has been on the rise in this age group. The meningococcal ACWY (MenACWY) vaccine is available from the GP for those who are eligible. The vaccination programme covers all 14 to 18 year olds and 19 to 25 year olds starting university for the first time.\nYou can check that you know the symptoms of meningitis and septicaemia at help to share the Meningitis Awareness Week campaign by visiting www.meningitis.org/maw2016 and using #MRFAwarenessWeek on social media.\nFor any questions about meningitis, septicaemia and vaccinations that can prevent the diseases call MRF’s free helpline on 080 8800 3344 or visit www.meningitis.org.",

She is urging constituents to go online and sign the petition.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“Victims are domestic abuse should be protected by the UK government, not punished financially for their inability to engage with an abusive ex-partner.\n“The UK Government advises victims of domestic abuse that they should utilise their less safe ‘Direct-Pay’ scheme, which has no powers of enforcement and allows continued communication through bank transfers.\n“The Tories have shown a complete lack of compassion by introducing this charge and even worse, they actually risk putting the lives of domestic abuse victim-survivors and their children in real danger.\n“The UK Government must look again at this unfair tax and listen to calls from charities, the public and MPs to scrap it – ultimately, it will be the children that child maintenance payments are intended to support who will lose out.”\nHi Alison,\nYour office actually helped me with the CMS recently and while I applaud this campaign I am curious if you will do anything about the 20% charge that the paying parent is taxed via the same service?

The call is part of a wider campaign to reform unfair tax treaties.\nScotland has had close links with Malawi, dating back to when Scottish explorer David Livingstone arrived in Malawi in the 1850s. Each year, more than 94,000 Scots are involved in organisations that link with Malawi, according to the Scotland Malawi Partnership, the national network which exists to coordinate, represent and support Scotland’s civic links with Malawi, and which is supporting ActionAid’s campaign.\nThe Scotland Malawi Partnership has a number of member organisations in Glasgow Central which have links with Malawi.\nMalawi is one of the poorest countries in the world, with GDP per person of just $255 per year. This is a country where 10.5 million people live in extreme poverty – surviving on less than US$1.90 a day. More tax revenue is desperately needed to improve public services and pay for more doctors and teachers. Malawi has one of the highest child mortality rates in the world with more than one in twenty children dying before the age of 5.\nUK companies are the third largest investor there, with investments worth a total of US$157 million in 2010. Yet the outdated and unfair tax treaty has tied the hands of the Malawian government. The treaty was signed in 1955, prior to Malawi’s independence, by the British Governor on behalf of the governments of the British colonies of Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland.\nThe treaty is so out-of-date that it does not cover the taxation of television related income. The treaty also makes it possible for British multinationals to easily move money out of Malawi untaxed using methods such as interest or management fee payments, dividends or royalties.\nMs Thewliss is supporting a joint campaign with Malawian and UK activists, calling on the Government to replace this treaty with one that is fairer, and that supports Malawi in its fight against poverty.\nSince the campaign launched, both the UK Government and the Government of Malawi issued statements in which they say they hope a treaty can be renegotiated soon. ActionAid and the Scotland Malawi Partnership welcome this progress, and will continue campaigning to ensure that any new treaty is fair and helps Malawi raise revenue to fight poverty.\nCommenting, Ms Thewliss said:\n“Corporate tax scandals show how angry the British public are that big business isn’t paying its fair share.\n“Scotland’s long and enduring relationship with Malawi stretches back over 150 years, and today many local people in [INSERT MP’s CONSTITUENCY] are actively engaged in building up social, cultural and economic ties. But the UK-Malawi tax treaty is not fit for the 21st century.\nThat’s why I’m calling on the UK government to agree a better deal with Malawi – one that ensures that UK companies pay their fair share in one of the world’s poorest countries.”\nCharlie Matthews, ActionAid UK’s Senior Advocacy Adviser, said:\n“Malawi is losing out due to an outdated and unfair treaty, which makes it possible for UK businesses operating there to dramatically reduce their tax bill. Women and girls living in poverty are the ones paying the price as public services like schools and hospitals are starved of funding.\n“ActionAid is working with the Scotland Malawi Partnership to call on the UK government to negotiate a new, fairer treaty, one that makes tax fair for the people of Malawi.”\nDavid Hope Jones of the Scotland-Malawi Partnership said:\n“Scotland is rightly proud of its many links with Malawi which date back more than 150 years to Dr David Livingstone. This dignified two-way people-to-people partnership unites our two nations in solidarity and friendship. Many of our 800+ member organisations across Scotland are concerned at the out-dated 1955 UK-Malawi Tax Treaty. We applaud both the UK and the Malawian Government for their commitment to update this colonial-era treaty, helping Malawi retain more tax revenue for the benefit of the people of Malawi. We look forward to seeing the outcome of the re-negotiation as soon as possible.”",

I didn’t know what to do and where to turn and felt that by contacting my MP, they could help the difficult situation that I was in.\n“After contacting Alison, her team were so welcoming and helpful throughout all of this, and I can’t thank them enough for the support.\n“If anyone finds themselves in a difficult position such as mine, I urge them to contact Alison’s office as their support has really made a huge difference to my family’s life.”\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“Over the past few months, my constituent has been so patient throughout what must have been a distressing time for them and their family.\n“My team were able to contact Glasgow City Council to gain an understanding of the issues that were being faced by the constituent and what could be done to provide further support.\n“I want to give a thanks to Glasgow City Council for their continuous dialogue throughout this case and their understanding of the difficulties being faced by the constituent.\n“If any Glasgow Central constituents are in need of support, please do not hesitate to contact my office via email: alison.thewliss.mp@parliament.uk, or via phone call: 0141 552 7117. My team are always more than happy to help with a range of issues and urge any constituent to contact my team.”\nTHEWLISS CALLS FOR A COMPASSIONATE APPROACH FOLLOWING NEW DRUG DEATH FIGURES\nNEW FIGURES SHOW GLASGOW HAS HIGHEST RATE OF DRUG MISUSE DEATHS\nAlison Thewliss, the Member of Parliament for Glasgow Central, has called for a more compassionate approach from the UK Government to drug users following new figures on the number of drug deaths across Scotland.\nThe new figures show the Glasgow City Council area had the highest rate of drug misuse deaths over a five-year period (44.4 per 100,000).\nThese new figures come after the Scottish Government proposed the decriminalisation of all drugs for personal use in July.\nMinisters in Scotland urged the UK Government to agree to proposals in an attempt to save more lives through this policy.\nSpeaking at a press conference in July, Scotland’s drugs policy minister Elena Whitham called for a public health approach to tackling the drugs crisis.\nShe said discrimination would mean people found in possession of drugs were “treated and supported rather than criminalised and excluded”.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“While it is encouraging to see a significant decrease in drug deaths, these figures remain unacceptably high. My thoughts are with everyone who has lost a loved one to drugs.\n“This reduction in deaths should serve as a catalyst for even greater efforts to provide assistance and opportunities for recovery to those who need it most. The root causes of substance abuse, such as poverty, homelessness, and lack of access to education and employment have been exacerbated by over a decade of austerity.\n“It is not acceptable for the UK Government to sit on their hands and block efforts to provide harm reduction initiatives such as safe consumption facilities in Glasgow. The Misuse of Drugs Act must be urgently reviewed, as it is a barrier to saving lives and tackling the harms associated with drug use.\n“The stigma associated with drug use not only prevents individuals from seeking help but also causes a cycle of shame and isolation. By treating people who use drugs with compassion and respect, we can create an environment where they feel safe to reach out for support.\n“Recovery communities have made a significant contribution, building a network of grassroots support. The Scottish Government’s public health approach rightly focuses on providing accessible and effective treatment options, harm reduction strategies, and mental health services. Increasing the availability of life-saving Naloxone treatment has saved lives, and I would encourage more people to get trained on how to use it.\n“I firmly support the Scottish Government’s proposals to decriminalise drugs for personal use. We must learn from good practice around the world; nothing should be off the table for tackling this issue which has already cost so many lives and devastated so many families.”\nBank of Scotland Response – Albert Drive Closure\nAs my constituents may be aware, the Bank of Scotland branch on Albert Drive closed on the 27th July this year. After being contacted by a number of my constituents with concerns about this closure, I was able to raise these concerns directly with Bank of Scotland.\nPlease find Bank of Scotland’s response to my query about the Albert Drive branch closure below:\n“I understand that the closure of our Bank of Scotland branch in Pollokshields last month was disappointing for some members of the community.\n“We never take the decision to close any branch lightly. In this instance, the decision, was based on careful analysis of the usage of the branch over the last few years.\n“Before we made the announcement, we carefully considered the impact closing the branch would have on our customers. Our team visited the community to see for themselves the impact that closing the branch would have, looked at the alternative banking options available, and assessed the availability of public transport to get to the closest alternative branch.\n“We also looked at all information available to us – including the ways customers are choosing to bank with us, the number of vulnerable people in the local area, and the accessibility of alternative banking facilities including the Post Office. After carrying out this assessment, we only went ahead once we were satisfied there are suitable alternatives and sufficient access to cash locally.\n“As part of the industry-wide Cash Action Group process, LINK also independently reviewed overall cash provision in Pollokshields prior to our announcement being made. Given the alternatives available, they did not recommend any additional services.\n“Over the last five years, the number of transactions in our Pollokshields branch had continued to fall. The decline in transactions reflects wider trends across the industry, as people choose to use branches less often – accessing services over the telephone or online, or via the Post Office. The majority of our customers now choose to bank with us in more than one way. For example, 83 per cent of our personal customers at Pollokshields branch were already using other branches and other ways to bank such as Internet and Telephone Banking.\n“Our Bank of Scotland Glasgow Victoria Road branch is less than one mile away and there are regular direct trains to Victoria Road with a journey time of 5 minutes. Our Glasgow Shawlands branch is a little over one mile away and takes around 10 minutes to travel to on the bus. Currently both Glasgow Victoria Road branch and Glasgow Shawlands have extended opening hours in comparison to Pollokshields branch giving customers more convenience when they choose to visit the branch.\n“Through our commercial arrangement with the Post Office, all Bank of Scotland customers can withdraw and deposit cash for free over the counter, and pay in cheques, at any branch of the Post Office.\n“There are also other alternatives in the community including a number of free-to-use cash machines in the area, including three within 0.5 miles at Day Today, Kenmure Street, Friends Convenience Store, Pollokshaws Road, and Sainsbury’s, Darnley Road.\n“People can also use telephone banking or our online services. This means that for many of the day-to-day transactions required by our customers in Pollokshields, there is no need to travel to an alternative Bank of Scotland branch. Many customers find the ease of these alternatives to be preferable to travelling to and from a branch. For those looking to open a bank account, or apply for a loan or a mortgage, applications can be made online, or by phone. For those customers wanting to talk to a mortgage adviser face to face and from a place that suits them, our video call service could be the perfect option. More details can be found on our website.\n“You can be assured that branch staff talked to customers about the service the local Post Office offers and helped those who wished to learn about how to use online and telephone banking. Prior to the closure branch staff contacted vulnerable customers to help them understand the options available to them and supported them through the transition. We understand that some older customers may have concerns about banking online, although only 7 per cent of customers who used the Pollokshields branch are aged 75 plus. We also have a ‘Digital Helpline’ which offers free one-to-one guidance over the phone to support customers using the Internet for banking. Customers with an identified need for this service were provided with contact details, enabling them to get free support if required. We will also supply a free tablet and SIM card with data in cases where people cannot afford to go online.\n“Our online banking provides a variety of tools for managing a customer’s money. If customers are apprehensive about using this, we have a section on our website with a step-by-step guide, showing how they can get set up. We also have a section that explains how customers can protect themselves online. Further details can be found on our website here.\n“We also try to make sure banking is easy for people of all abilities and needs. Customers who have a disability or impairment or would just like extra help can find out more information about the ways we can support them by discussing things with local branch staff or by visiting our website here.”\nTHEWLISS BACKS SCOTTISH GOVERNMENT PROPOSALS FOR DECRIMINALISATION OF ALL DRUGS FOR PERSONAL USE\nAlison Thewliss, the Member of Parliament for Glasgow Central, has backed calls by the Scottish Government for the decriminalisation of all drugs for personal use.\nMinisters in Scotland have called on the UK Government to agree to proposals.\nDrug laws are currently reserved to Westminster.\nSpeaking at a press conference on Friday, Scotland’s drugs policy minister Elena Whitham called for a public health approach to tackling the drugs crisis.\nShe said discrimination would mean people found in possession of drugs were “treated and supported rather than criminalised and excluded”.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said\n“I am pleased to see the Scottish Government taking a bold step towards addressing the complex issue of drug use by proposing the decriminalisation of all drugs for personal use. This approach recognises that addiction is primarily a health issue and should be treated as such, rather than as a criminal matter.\n“Decades of evidence and international experiences have shown that punitive approaches to drug use have not been successful in reducing drug-related harms. Instead, they have perpetuated a cycle of criminalisation, stigmatisation, and marginalisation, leading to devastating consequences for individuals and communities.\n“By decriminalising drug use, we can shift the focus towards harm reduction, rehabilitation, and support services. This approach will enable individuals struggling with drug addiction to seek the help they need without fear of criminal repercussions. It opens up the possibility of treating addiction as a public health issue, offering individuals a chance to recover and reintegrate into society.\n“I commend the Scottish Government for their progressive stance and for prioritising the health and well-being of individuals affected by drug addiction. For too long, my constituents have been suffering at the hands of these restrictive policies for drug users. It is high time that this UK Tory Government take action to support people all across these Isles through a renewed approach to drug use.”\nTHEWLISS CHALLENGES ROBERT JENRICK OVER FALSE CLAIMS THAT SCOTLAND DO NOT TAKE IN REFUGEES\nAlison Thewliss, Member of Parliament for Glasgow Central, has challenged the Minister of State for Immigration, Robert Jenrick following a clash in the House of Commons.\nThe Minister falsely claimed that no refugees attended the Refugee Festival Scotland, with Jenrick accusing Scotland of not taking in any refugees.\nRobert Jenrick was questioned in the Commons today over the economic impact of the Government’s Rwanda policy.\nIt has been estimated that it will cost £169,000 per person to deport asylum seekers to the African nation.\nAlison Thewliss MP said:\n“The Minister of State for Immigration is a complete and utter disgrace. His false claims in the Commons today only emphasises what we have all known about this UK Tory Government; they have no shame and cannot be trusted to tell the truth.\n“The Conservative Illegal Migration Bill would be an effective ban on people seeking sanctuary, against all the UK’s international obligations. It is also a colossal waste of public money in a cost of living crisis.\n“Scotland’s commitment to welcoming refugees is a testament to our compassion and solidarity. Asylum seekers and refugees must be embraced, respected, and given the opportunity to thrive and rebuild their lives.\n“Refugee Week provided a unique opportunity to celebrate the contributions of refugees to our society and to raise awareness about the challenges they face. Refugee Week showcased a range of inspiring events and initiatives that foster understanding, promote integration, and challenge misconceptions about refugees.\n“In Scotland, we say it loud and we say it clear: refugees are welcome here.”\nAlison Thewliss Letter to Rishi Sunak on Robert Jenrick\nDear Rishi,\nI am writing to you in your capacity as arbiter of conduct of Ministers.\nI wish to highlight the conduct of the Minister for Immigration, Robert Jenrick MP in the House of Commons chamber on 27th June. Mr Jenrick made the claim that no refugees are housed in Scotland, and a further claim that no asylum seekers are housed in Scotland. Given the opportunity to correct this demonstrably false statement on the record, he declined.\nThis conduct is of the utmost seriousness. The UK Government’s ministerial code states: “It is of paramount importance that ministers give accurate and truthful information to parliament, correcting any inadvertent error at the earliest opportunity. Ministers who knowingly mislead parliament will be expected to offer their resignation to the Prime Minister.”\nHome Office data from 2020 to 2021 published last year showed Scotland took in around 13% of all refugees resettled in the UK during that period – well above our proportion of the UK’s population of 8%.\nThe Home Office’s most recent quarterly figures show Glasgow remains the local authority with the most dispersed asylum seekers (70 per 10,000 residents), followed by Birmingham (17 per 10,000), and Hillingdon (18 per 10,000).\nScotland has also taken in 20% of all Ukrainian arrivals under the Homes for Ukrainian scheme and the Scottish Government Super Sponsor scheme.\nFollowing the crisis in Syria in 2015, Scottish local authorities welcomed asylum seekers and by early 2020 there were over 3500 individuals in all 32 of Scotland’s local authority areas, under the Syrian Resettlement programme and the Vulnerable Children’s Resettlement Scheme.\nMr Jenrick’s conduct has not only breached the Ministerial Code, but caused great offence to communities in Scotland.\nThe Scottish Refugee Council were unequivocal in their condemnation of Mr Jenrick’s actions:\n“We are truly shocked by the wild inaccuracies shared here by immigration minister Robert Jenrick. The minister is either knowingly lying or is not aware that Scotland welcomes thousands of people seeking sanctuary each year. We are not sure which is more concerning. With the proposal of the inhumane Illegal Migration Bill and the increase in far-right rhetoric, including from the UK government, it is vital that we call out these blatant falsehoods.”\nI urge you to consider the Minister’s position.\nTHEWLISS URGES URGENT RECONSIDERATION OF BANK OF SCOTLAND CLOSURE\nREPORT SHOWS 4 IN 10 OLDER PEOPLE ARE NOT MANAGING THEIR MONEY ONLINE\nAlison Thewliss, Member of Parliament for Glasgow Central, has called on an urgent reconsideration of the closure of Bank of Scotland on Albert Drive following new findings on online banking.\nAge UK’s new report ‘You can’t bank on it anymore’, which looks at the effect of rising online banking on older people, has found that 4 in 10 older people with a bank account in Britain are not managing their money online and could be at high risk of financial exclusion.\nThe polling also found that three-quarters (75 per cent) of over-65s with a bank account – equivalent to 7.86 million people – wish to undertake at least one banking task in person at a bank branch, building society or Post Office.\nNearly a third of older people with a bank account (31 per cent) – equivalent to 3.25 million people – have also been found to feel uncomfortable with online banking.\nWith these new findings, Alison Thewliss MP has called on an urgent review ahead of the proposed closure of Bank of Scotland’s Albert Drive branch.\nThe Albert Drive branch is set to close on the 27th July.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“These new findings by Age UK show the impact the closure of the Bank of Scotland branch on Albert Drive will have on older people in Pollokshields.\n“In-person banking continues to be important to many of my constituents, and the removal of access to cash in their local area remains extremely unfair.\n“While online banking becomes a key part of society, we must not forget those unable to participate. Those who wish to attend their local branch should have the option – instead of being completely left in limbo.\n“I ask that Bank of Scotland reconsider the decision to close the Albert Drive branch to ensure that my constituents continue to have access to the full range of banking services in their own neighbourhood.”\nTHEWLISS URGES CONSTITUENTS TO REDEEM ENERGY SUPPORT VOUCHERS\n43% OF VOUCHERS LEFT UNCLAIMED IN GLASGOW CENTRAL\nAlison Thewliss, Member of Parliament for Glasgow Central, has urged constituents to redeem their prepayment meter vouchers issued to households.\nNew stats released by the Government found that 17,760 (57%) of prepayment meter vouchers were redeemed.\nThis means that 43% of these vouchers have been left unclaimed by Glasgow Central constituents.\nIn October and November, vouchers were valued at £66 – with December and January’s being valued at £67.\nWith these values, the 13,450 unredeemed vouchers have a value of at least £887,700.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“If you are on a traditional prepayment meter, you should be getting £66 or £67 vouchers each month. This is an entitlement which a large amount of my constituents have not redeemed.\n“In this cost-of-living crisis, any additional money during these difficult times could make a massive difference to people’s lives.\n“If you are using a traditional prepayment meter and have not received any of the monthly vouchers through the post, or by email or text message, you can contact your energy supplier to enquire about this payment. This must be done before the 1st June to ensure you are eligible for the payment.\n“If any Glasgow Central constituents are in need of support for this payment, please do not hesitate to contact my office via email: alison.thewliss.mp@parliament.uk, or via phone call: 0141 552 7117. My team are always more than happy to help with any constituent issues and urge any constituent to contact my team.”\nCONSTITUENT ENDS LONGSTANDING ISSUE WITH OPENREACH\nGLASGOW CENTRAL MP THANKS CONSTITUENT FOR THEIR PATIENCE\nA Glasgow Central constituent has ended a longstanding dispute with Openreach after contacting their local MP.\nThe constituent contacted the office of Alison Thewliss MP in February of 2022, highlighting issues with potholes in the Govan area.\nWith the number of potholes and the constant bouncing of buses and trucks on these broken roads, the constituent’s home was experiencing a large amount of vibrations – causing difficulties with sleep.\nAfter dialogue with Glasgow City Council, it was highlighted that it would be Openreach who would need to deal with the case.\nA box which was installed by Openreach was also seen to be causing a large amount of noise in the area, which the constituent highlighted in her emails to the office.\nWith the support of Alison Thewliss MP, the constituent was able to highlight the key areas which were causing the most amount of problems.\nOpenreach contacted the office of Alison Thewliss MP and the constituent to confirm that the works would be completed on the 1st March, ending the longstanding issues faced over the past year.\nAfter confirmation from Openreach that the works had been completed, the constituent contacted the office of Alison Thewliss MP to extend her thanks for the support.\nCommenting, the constituent said:\n“I am so relieved to have these issues resolved. I have faced a year of difficulties, and it is great to be able to live in the comfort of my own home without the worry of not being able to have a good sleep.\n“I can’t thank Alison and her team enough for the support they have given me in this case. The patience and dedication shown by the team is something which I am extremely grateful for.\n“It has been a long time since this case was started with Alison’s team, and I am delighted to see it has finally been resolved.”\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“I am delighted to see this case has been resolved with the constituent. This case has been going on for more than a year, and I can’t begin to imagine how difficult the past year must have been.\n“While my team were in touch with Openreach, my constituent has been so patient and understood the issues we faced in this case.\n“I also want to extend a thanks to the Openreach, who were also very helpful in this issue and were in regular dialogue with my team about this case.\n“As mentioned by the constituent, it will be such a relief to be able to live in their home without worry, and I hope this will make a massive difference to their life.\n“If any Glasgow Central constituents have issues they wish to raise, please do not hesitate to contact my office via email: alison.thewliss.mp@parliament.uk, or via phone call: 0141 552 7117. My team are always more than happy to help with any constituent issues and urge any constituent to contact my team.”",
  "http_www_alisonthewliss_scot/http_www_alisonthewliss_scot_alison-thewliss-mp-shows-her-support-for-christian-aid-week/content_458.html": "Alison Thewliss, the local MP for Glasgow Central, this week attended a Christian Aid Big Brekkie event in Parliament, to show her support for Christian Aid Week (13-19 May). This year Christian Aid Week is encouraging the British public to stand together with the millions of displaced people who have been forced to leave their homes around the world.\nAhead of Christian Aid Week, Alison Thewliss MP attended the event in Parliament to find out about activities and events taking place during the charity’s annual fundraising week in Glasgow Central. Last year, £12,614 was raised in Glasgow Central during Christian Aid Week.\nToday, more than 40 million people are internally displaced by conflict, accounting for approximately two thirds of those who find themselves forced from their homes. A further 24 million were displaced by disasters in 2016 alone. Yet, because they haven’t crossed a border, the general public rarely hear about them.\nDespite the huge number of people affected, situations of internal displacement receive almost no political attention, funding or support.\nChristian Aid works with local partner organisations around the world to help internally displaced people. This includes working with partners in Haiti, where thousands of people have been displaced by natural disasters in recent years.\nVilia was left homeless by the earthquake in 2010 and her mother was killed. Bereaved and homeless, for Vilia, her husband and their seven children, life became a struggle. They didn’t even have a safe place to sleep.\nChristian Aid’s local partner, KORAL, helps local people prepare for disasters. In the aftermath of the earthquake, it reached out to Vilia and built her and her family a new home, that was safe, stable and strong enough to stand up to natural disasters.\nAhead of Hurricane Matthew, KORAL was able to warn local communities, helping to evacuate around 5,000 families and saving many lives. In the immediate aftermath Christian Aid and KORAL distributed urgently-needed shelter materials, hygiene products such as soap, food seeds and cash, so people could buy other items that they really needed. Disaster-resistant homes were built, giving people safe, secure places to live. Of the dozens built before the hurricane hit, only one lost its roof in the disaster, and Vilia’s home was able to shelter 54 people over several days following the hurricane.\nAlison Thewliss said: “I was pleased to meet with Christian Aid this week, to hear about the great work that is being done in Glasgow Central and across the country to help people around the world who have been forced from their homes. For millions of people across the globe, Christian Aid’s work provides vital support. I encourage my constituents to get involved in Christian Aid Week events in Glasgow Central where they can.”\nSimon Kirkland, Christian Aid’s UK Parliamentary and Political Adviser, said: “We are very grateful for Alison Thewliss’s support for Christian Aid’s important fundraising events in Glasgow Central. Everyone can do something to help this Christian Aid Week, whether it’s attending a local event, giving money or praying for the world’s many displaced people at this difficult time. Thank you to everyone who is able to take part in this year’s Christian Aid Week.”",

Ms Thewliss was one of many MPs joining WWF in London this week to show they care about the future of our planet, ahead of the global lights out event, due to take place on Saturday 19 March at 8:30pm.\nMPs are celebrating Earth Hour to send a message that they care about the natural world and help inspire their constituents to go beyond the hour to build a sustainable future for both people and the planet.\nMs Thewliss said: “Our natural world is precious to all life that inhabits it, but we need to do more to protect it. WWF’s Earth Hour reminds us that there are simple things we can all do for the planet, not for just one hour, but every day. It’s a great opportunity to bring together millions of people from across the world with one united goal – to help protect our planet. That’s why this Earth Hour I’m showing I care about the future of our planet by making a special pledge for a low carbon future.”\nEvery year Earth Hour inspires millions of people around the world to come together and switch off their lights for one hour in a symbolic act to show they care about our brilliant planet. WWF already works to tackle a lot of environmental challenges – like deforestation, threats to endangered species, and the impacts of climate change – but Earth Hour is a chance for everyone to say they’ll do their bit to help create a sustainable future. It reminds us that together we have the power to make change happen.\nLast year a record-breaking 172 countries and some of the world’s most famous buildings including Big Ben, Hong Kong’s skyline and the Sydney Harbour Bridge joined the global celebration. In the UK alone, over 10 million people took part, along with over 4,800 schools, 200 landmarks and thousands of businesses and organisations.\nJennifer Clements, spokesperson for WWF’s Earth Hour, said: “We’re thrilled that MPs have given their support to this year’s Earth Hour and we hope they will inspire many others to get involved. By taking one simple step to switch off your lights at 8.30pm on 19 March, Earth Hour is a chance for all of us to come together and send out a global message about protecting our planet.”\nEveryone can join the celebration for WWF’s Earth Hour on Saturday 19 March 2016.

As politicians, we have a responsibility to consider the wider implications of the decisions we take, the causes we promote, and the impact they will have on our constituents. Grassroots sport and recreation is one such cause which I am proud to champion.\nAt a time when our local services are under enormous pressure, and demand is growing, we should look to alternative and innovative solutions to help us tackle the challenges and opportunities facing society. Sport has a significant social value, which is often under-appreciated; it can make us healthier, happier and help to create close community bonds. It can teach us valuable life-skills and it can inspire us to try new things and challenge ourselves.\nThe success of the GB teams in the Olympic and Paralympic Games highlight the depth of talent and passion for sport that we have in this country. However, without accessible facilities, trained coaches and valued volunteers, those aspiring champions and recreational enthusiasts would not have an outlet for their talents. Ensuring local communities have such facilities is of primary importance to the future health of our nation.\nI was excited to see the Sport and Recreation Alliance launch their Get Your Kit On – A Guide to Grassroots Sport and Recreation at the event today. I look forward to working with the Alliance and their members to help support sport and recreation in my own constituency in order for the true benefit of sport to be felt by everyone in the local community.",
  "http_www_alisonthewliss_scot/https_www_alisonthewliss_scot_thewliss-shows-disgust-at-rwanda-plans/content_350.html": "In response to UK government’s recent announcements that it will begin sending people claiming asylum to Rwanda, and also that it will open a new asylum accommodation centre in Linton-on-Ouse in North Yorkshire, Alison Thewliss MP, Chair of the APPG on Immigration Detention, has made the following statement:\n“The plans introduced by the UK government to send asylum seekers to Rwanda from Britain are utterly appalling.\n“The UN High Commissioner for Refugees has already condemned these plans on ethical and legal grounds, while senior Home Office officials say there’s no evidence the arrangment will provide value for money. There are serious questions of transparency and how the Home Office can ever be held to account for what happens to the individuals it sends to Rwanda. But this is just another example of the Government abandoning its responsibility to offer sanctuary and support to those fleeing persecution.\n“My recent visit to Napier Barracks allowed me to see first-hand how profoundly unsuitable and dehumanising such sites are for asylum seekers. The dilapidated former barracks used by the Government to house asylum seekers are inadequate, lacking in facilities and people there struggle to get access to lawyers and adequate healthcare. It is frightening to imagine what a facility located in another country thousands of miles away from scrutiny will be like.\n“I would have hoped that the Tory Government would learn from the comments made after our visit. Yet despite the warnings given to them about the conditions in Napier, the government is proceeding with plans at Linton-on-Ouse. With other members of the APPG, I have repeatedly called for Napier Barracks to close and for the UK government not to open any further similar sites. I reiterate that call today.\n“It is time for the government to get a grip and stop with these tactics to divert the attention away from the chaos within this Government. Thousands of human lives are at risk here, they must be protected. During the worst cost of living crisis to date, the Government should be focusing on allowing all people to have enough money to feed themselves, rather than pandering to the dog whistle politics of the far right.”",
  "http_www_alisonthewliss_scot/http_www_alisonthewliss_scot_northern-ireland-secretary-must-act-to-scrap-rape-clause/content_470.html": "Alison Thewliss, MP for Glasgow Central, today challenged Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire to use his influence in the UK Government to protect vulnerable women in Northern Ireland and scrap the two child policy and rape clause.\nThe campaigning MP asked the Northern Ireland Secretary to highlight the impact that Section 5 of the Criminal Law Act (Northern Ireland) 1967 has on referrals under the rape clause, as it results in automatic disclosure of rape allegations directly to the police. Concerns have been raised by women’s organisations, including the Northern Ireland Women’s Aid Federation, who Ms Thewliss met with in September following her attendance at an anti-rape clause rally in Belfast.\nThird party professionals, such as doctors, midwives, social workers and support workers, can face a prison sentence of up to 10 years if they fail to disclose that a woman has been raped when completing the rape clause form – even if doing so means that women are placed in further danger of violence and sexual assault from their abusive partners.\nSpeaking after Northern Ireland Questions, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“I have been pursuing the UK Government on this abhorrent policy for over two years now, and it’s evident that the rape clause’s sickening impact on women in Northern Ireland is becoming clearer by the day. In addition to the repugnant position that vulnerable women are being placed in by having to disclose one of the worst experiences of their lives to make a claim for a benefit, they, and the third party professionals that support them, could face criminalisation under existing law in Northern Ireland.\n“The Northern Ireland Women’s Aid Federation is the latest in a long line of women’s aid organisations, charities and trades unions to join the campaign against the two child policy and rape clause. The stakes are so high for thousands of doctors, nurses, women’s aid workers and support workers who face potential criminalisation under the rape clause.\n“The Northern Ireland Secretary must now stand up for vulnerable women in Northern Ireland and ask his colleagues in the DWP to scrap the pernicious, mediaeval and unworkable two child policy and rape clause once and for all.”",

The plan to restrict child tax credits to two children for new claimants is due to commence in 2017.\nSNP MP Alison Thewliss first identified the issue in July 2015 during the Government’s summer budget.\nCommenting as she launched the latest stage of the campaign in Glasgow City Centre, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“We think the policy on limiting tax credits to the first two children is appalling and tantamount to social engineering, but to put a woman who has been raped in a position where she needs to declare that to a government official is just abhorrent. This also stigmatises the child involved, which is surely against the UN convention on the rights of the child. This proposal has no place in the twenty-first century and must be dropped immediately.\n“I’ve raised this issue on the floor of the House of Commons on no less than nine occasions – yet the Government still can’t explain how it will work and remains hell bent on pressing ahead with this draconian procedure.\n“With just two weeks left to run on this important petition, we are urging as many people as possible to visit www.scraptherapeclause.co.uk and add their voice to the many others calling upon the Government to drop this appalling proposal.”\nAngela Devine, Manager of Glasgow Women’s Aid, said:\n“Glasgow Women’s Aid is pleased to support this coordinated campaign calling for the Government to scrap the proposed rape clause for tax credits.\n“As an organisation offering refuge and support to some of the most vulnerable women and children in our city, we know the damaging effect this clause could have on women who have already endured trauma.\n“It is not uncommon for children to be the product of rape or coercive control and women should never be placed in the humiliating position of appealing to the DWP for benefits.\n“We would ask whether DWP staff will be trained to deal with sensitive disclosures and to signpost women to the correct support services.\n“Any just society has a moral obligation to care for its poor and vulnerable with children at the heart of this obligation, regardless of their provenance.\n“We as an organisation see this policy as an attempt to control and thereby undermine the already vulnerable position of women, children and young people within society.\n“We reject these changes as untenable and discriminatory.”",

Mr O’Donnell explained that he had been pursuing the PIP claim for several years but was yet to receive any answer on the matter.\nThe constituent asked for a Legal Entitlements and Administrative Practices (LEAP) review as he believed his mobility element may have been miscalculated due to having agoraphobia.\nA letter from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) was sent to confirm that the matter was being investigated and an update would be provided in due course.\nAfter years of patience, Mr O’Donnell was informed by the DWP that he would be given a payment of £9191.41. This payment was calculated using the PIP payments he received and those he is now entitled to for the period 23 March 2016 until 7 June 2022.\nCommenting on his delight at receiving this payment, Michael O’Donnell said:\n“I can’t thank Alison and her team enough for the support they have given me in this case. The patience and dedication shown by the team is something which I am extremely grateful for.\n“I have been trying for years to get this PIP payment but to get it after such a long period of waiting has been such a relief.\n“The amount of money I have received is truly life-changing and will help greatly in the lead up to Christmas.\n“Since getting this money, I have spoken with several friends to urge them to speak with Alison about any issue they have due to how helpful she has been in this process.\n“The process was much easier than I expected, and I will be forever grateful to the team for making sure that I was given this life-changing amount of money.”\nCommenting on this case, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“I am so happy that Michael was able to receive this payment. After approaching our office in June, it was clear he had been waiting a long time for this payment which he was owed.\n“While my team spoke with the DWP, Michael was so patient and understood the issues we faced in this case.\n“I also want to extend a thanks to the DWP, who were also very helpful in this issue and were in regular dialogue with my team about this case.\n“As Michael said, this amount of money will no doubt make a huge difference to his life, and it brings me such great pride to be able to help the constituent in this way.”\nThewliss supports Royal Life Saving Society UK’s Drowning Prevention Week\nLast week, the Royal Life Saving Society UK (RLSS UK), the national charity and leader in lifesaving and lifeguarding training across the UK and Ireland, brought its annual Drowning Prevention Week campaign to Westminster.\nAlison Thewliss came together with the RLSS UK CEO and Charity Director, lifeguards, Olympian Professor Greg Whyte OBE, Paralympian Ellie Robinson MBE, and over 50 other Parliamentarians to discuss the importance of spreading water safety awareness, as well as what practical steps could be taken in Glasgow Central to address the issue.\nAt the event, Thewliss had the chance to see this guidance first-hand, including how to use throw lines, how to respect bodies of water, among other resources and also check out the cutting-edge equipment that is now being used to keep our shorelines and lakes safer than ever.\nThe RLSS UK also showed MPs the charity’s brand-new animation aimed at educating parents and their children about water safety and starting conversations of how their family can enjoy the water safely this summer.\nOver 400 people die every year in the UK and Ireland from accidental drowning, yet every drowning is avoidable. Of those who drown, some 40% had no intention of entering the water in the first place. Yet people should still feel free to enjoy the water, as with the correct education and awareness, this can be done safely.\nDrowning Prevention Week, which began on 18th June and continues until 25th June, encourages the public to be ready to enjoy being in, on, or around water this summer by ensuring that they and their families have a good understanding of water safety.\nLee Heard, Charity Director at RLSS UK said:\n“With June, July, and August proving to be the months with the most fatalities, it is vitally important that everyone understands water safety, especially during the summer months.\n“We want to ensure that everyone can enjoy their summer break and enjoy being in or around water but be safe in the knowledge that they, and their children, have the skills and understanding about water safety, which could potentially save a life.”\n“It is fantastic to have Alison Thewliss supporting our Drowning Prevention Week campaign and highlighting the issues surrounding water safety education and helping to educate communities in Glasgow Central.”\nOlympian Professor Greg Whyte OBE, said:\n“I have been privileged to work with the Royal Life Saving Society UK for many years, as we strive to spread awareness around water safety and help people to enjoy water safely.\n“Every MP who came along to our event, and who helps us spread the message and awareness of this important campaign is helping us reach our ultimate goal of zero water deaths, and for that I am grateful.”\nParalympian Ellie Robinson MBE, said:\n“While swimming ability is of course crucial, far more worrying is the statistic that some 40% of people who drown had no intention of entering the water in the first place. Only by spreading greater awareness of water safety can we help people to enjoy water safely and reduce fatalities.”\nThe event came quickly after the inaugural meeting of the All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) for Water Safety. This took place earlier this month and aims to establish more accessible water safety education across the UK to prevent future drownings.\nDamien Moore MP, Chair of the APPG on Water Safety, said:\n“Every drowning is a tragedy, and despite the RLSS UK’s excellent education campaign having reached an estimated 20 million people across the UK, these horrific accidents continue to happen.\n“It is my sincerest hope that by hosting this event in Parliament, we have helped to further spread awareness of how best to enjoy water safely, so that ultimately lives can be saved.\n“I want to thank the RLSS UK, along with every MP who came along to our event, for the vital work that they are doing in spreading awareness.”\nTHEWLISS DEMANDS IMMEDIATE ACTION ON FOOTBALL INDEX IN PARLIAMENTARY DEBATE\nAlison Thewliss, Shadow Chancellor for the SNP and MP for Glasgow Central, has demanded that the Government takes immediate action on collapsed betting company, Football Index.\nA debate was held today, Tuesday 6th June, on the impact of the collapse of the company, which took place in March of 2021. The company had its licence stripped by the Gambling Commission and was forced to enter administration.\nIt has been estimated that customers collectively have over £90 million in open stakes trapped in the platform following its collapse – leaving average losses of around £3,000 per customer.\nFollowing confirmation that a debate would be taking place on the company, Thewliss has demanded that the time is now to ensure the customers affected by the collapse are compensated for.\nAlison Thewliss MP said:\n“The Government have been tiptoeing around the issue of Football Index for over a year now. Constituents in Glasgow Central have contacted my office and explained the distress they felt, having invested significant money into the company. They now feel completely betrayed by the lack of support following the collapse, and frustrated by the lack of action by regulators.\n“A support package must be put in place for victims of the scandal, particularly given the precedent set by the UK Government on the London Capital and Finance failure. It is entirely unfair that those who continue to have money locked away in the accounts of the now-collapsed firm are being left in the dark.\n“There remains a real worry that scandals such as Football Index could be repeated unless action is taken by the Gambling Commission. The Government must acknowledge the recommendations made by Michael Sheehan QC and implement these as soon as possible.\n“I am deeply disappointed that the Minister didn’t recognise that the Football Index scandal isn’t about people being compensated for gambling losses – it is a clear failure in regulation. On that basis, compensation should be due to those that have lost their life savings to a government-regulated Ponzi scheme.”\nTHEWLISS PLEDGES SUPPORT FOR IMPROVING LIVER HEALTH IN SCOTLAND\nGlasgow Central MP Alison Thewliss demonstrated her support for improving liver health in Scotland by attending the Love Your Liver roadshow, hosted by the British Liver Trust, in Glasgow on Thursday 19th May 2022.\nMs Thewliss is an advocate for the British Liver Trust’s work and recognises the importance of improving early diagnosis of liver disease. She encouraged her constituents and the people of Glasgow to attend the roadshow and find out the steps they can take to improve their liver health.\n90% of liver disease is preventable and if caught at an early stage liver damage can be reversed. However, the alarming reality is that three-quarters of people with cirrhosis are diagnosed when it is too late for effective intervention or treatment.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said: “I am delighted to support the Love Your Liver campaign and the charity’s work to improve early detection. Liver disease is a public health crisis and thousands of Scots are at risk. The Love Your Liver roadshow is a really important campaign, which is helping people better understand the importance of looking after their liver.”\nMembers of the public were encouraged to pop along to the Love Your Liver mobile unit in Argyle street to take a free liver screener, which assesses the potential for liver damage against the three main risk factors of alcohol, obesity and viral hepatitis. A free FibroScan was offered to those who had a potential risk and those with high readings were recommended to speak to their GP.\nScotland has a significant liver disease crisis with around 900 deaths each year. In 2020, it was one of the leading causes of death in Scotland in those under the age of 75. Mortality rates are also four times higher in deprived areas compared to more affluent areas.\nPamela Healy OBE, Chief Executive of British Liver Trust, said: “One in five of us are at risk of liver disease and the numbers of people being diagnosed have been increasing at an alarming rate. Liver damage develops silently with no signs or symptoms and people often don’t realise they have a problem until it is too late. Although the liver is remarkably resilient, if left until symptoms appear, the damage is often irreversible.\n“Our Love Your Liver roadshows are a great opportunity for people to find out their risk of liver disease and receive a free liver scan to see if there is any early damage. Approximately one in five people that are scanned are advised to have further checks.”\nThe British Liver Trust’s Love Your Liver campaign focuses on three simple steps for liver health:\n1. Drink within recommended limits and have three consecutive days off alcohol every week\n2. Cut down on sugar, carbohydrates and fat, and take more exercise\n3. Know the risk factors for viral hepatitis and get tested or vaccinated if at risk\nYou can find out if you are at risk and check your liver health online by doing the online screening test at https://www.britishlivertrust.org.uk/screener\nFor more If you couldn’t attend the events you can still find out if you are at risk and check your liver information on our Roadshows, visit: Love Your Liver Roadshows\nTHEWLISS CALLS ON IMMEDIATE GOVERNMENT ACTION ON PASSPORT WAITING TIMES\nAlison Thewliss, MP for Glasgow Central, has called upon the Government to step in immediately to stop the rising waiting times for passport applications.\nHer Majesty’s Passport Office has warned that applicants for new passports should “be prepared” for significant delays to applications in the coming months.\nThe impact of the pandemic saw over five million people delaying their renewal of passports between 2020 and 2021. With travel returning back to normal, applications for new passports for travellers are now reaching record highs.\nSpeaking on the impact of these delays, Thewliss described how difficult it has been for Glasgow Central constituents to receive their passports after applying for them.\nAlison Thewliss said:\n“Glasgow Central constituents have been contacting me to express their concerns over lengthy delays from the Passport Office – despite applications going in months ago.\n“With a huge backlog of applications to deal with after the pandemic, I completely appreciate how difficult it must be for the workers in these offices to process the requests in a timely manner. I am hopeful that the UK Government will acknowledge the pressure being put on Passport Offices across the country and employ more people to deal with the backlog of cases.\n“I am deeply concerned, however, by accounts from my constituents of being let down and lied to about their applications during a time of stress and uncertainty for them. One constituent in particular, Scott came to me with a list of false information he was given in relation to his passport application.\n“This ranged from being told people could go to collect their passport, which he said was not possible, to being told he would only need to wait 10 weeks to receive his passport, despite eventually waiting 12 weeks to receive it.\n“It is clear that there is immense pressure being put on Passport Offices across the country, but it remains completely unacceptable that my constituents are being given a false sense of hope during a time where they will no doubt be extremely nervous about being able to receive their passport in time.\n“The Government must ensure that the information being provided by Passport Offices is honest and accurate.”\nTHEWLISS TO LEAD DEBATE ON ‘UNSPEAKABLY CRUEL’ TWO CHILD CAP\nSNP MP, Alison Thewliss, will lead a debate today in Westminster Hall calling on the UK government to scrap the two child cap and ‘rape clause’ on working tax credits and Universal Credit.\nThe Glasgow Central MP described the policy, which limits the social security claimants can receive based on how many children they have, as ‘unspeakably cruel’ and demanded Tories end their dystopian policies punishing families and forcing survivors of sexual assualt to relive trauma.\nOver 1.1 million people are affected by the policy which the UK is alone in the world in implementing, being the sole country to limit benefits past 2 children.\nAlison Thewliss, the party’s Shadow Chancellor, said that due to the cost of living crisis the Tories must reconsider the policy and introduce further measures to alleviate households’ cost concerns.\nThe SNP are also calling for the introduction of the Real Living Wage, a reversal to Tory Universal Credit cuts, the turning of the energy support loan into a more generous grant and a u-turn on national insurance hikes.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“This is an unspeakably cruel policy that hasn’t worked to achieve its dystopian purpose and is now only exacerbating the cost of living concerns families are experiencing – with over 1 million people affected by this policy.\n“Families shouldn’t be punished for having children, nor have limits placed on them by the government over how many they can have, and in no civilised country should survivors of sexual assault be made to relive trauma to prove they’ve been raped to access vital benefits – that is disgusting.\n“The policy has been wrong from the beginning, that the Tories haven’t scrapped it on moral grounds is nothing short of a disgrace but they must at least now listen to our concerns given its impact on the cost of living crisis.\n“This policy is yet further proof that it hasn’t just been Tory inaction that has led to this crisis, but also direct Tory action with cruel policies such as this one.\n“In stark contrast the Scottish Government is providing for families with a, recently doubled, Scottish Child Payment – putting over £1,000 a year into the pockets of families in Scotland.\n“If the Tories won’t listen to us now it’ll prove, once again, that only with the full powers of independence can we provide support to families with the dignity and fairness they deserve and put more support on the table for households.”",

The Glasgow MP noted that the omission only served to further illustrate the Government’s reluctance to do the right thing by women and families.\nThe two child cap restricts tax credit payments to the first two children per family. At the same time, it forces women who want to claim an exemption for a third child – for example as a result of rape – to do so by submitting evidence and navigating a laborious administrative process.\nCommenting following the Chancellor’s budget speech, Ms Thewliss said:\n“I am sorely disappointed and exasperated that the Chancellor has missed yet another opportunity to do the right thing and scrap the UK Government’s pernicious two child policy and rape clause, which will push 200,000 children into poverty.\n“I have been pursuing the UK Government on this abhorrent policy for over two years now, and its sickening impact on women and families across the country is becoming clearer by the day.\n“On top of this, the Government is continuing to fail women in Northern Ireland who – along with third party referrers – could face prosecution under existing laws in Northern Ireland if they apply for an exemption, as I highlighted recently in parliament. The fact that these women are being forced to choose between struggling to put food on the table or going through the criminal justice system is unthinkable.\n“Clearly the Chancellor does not think the plight of women and families is an important enough issue to receive the attention it deserves. I, and my colleagues in the SNP, could not disagree more, and I will continue to urge the Government to reconsider their approach.”",

Everyone deserves to be cared for at the end of their life.\n“Every penny raised, every daffodil worn, helps fund our vital care and support. It means I can be there for someone who is dying.

Hon Alistair Burt MP, Minister for Community and Social Care, joined the NSPCC CEO in speaking at the launch and Alison Thewliss MP also heard first-hand from young people who have helped shape the campaign.\nAll too often children who have been abused have to develop chronic mental health problems, be suicidal or self-harm before therapeutic services become available to them, according to a recent survey of professionals working with these children. One of the young people who sat on the campaign advisory group, ‘A Force for Change’, said that support should be provided “at the point of need not the point of crisis”.\nAlison Thewliss MP has said “I am proud to support this campaign. In Scotland we have taken significant steps to expand support for vulnerable people through the National Action Plan to Tackle Child Sexual Exploitation, including an ongoing public awareness campaign and the opening of the National Child Abuse Investigation Unit within Police Scotland. I will continue to work hard to ensure that young people whose lives have been devastated by abuse can access the necessary support in order to rebuild their lives.”\nPeter Wanless, NSPCC Chief Executive, said more children than ever were coming forward to tell somebody about the abuse they have suffered. “But every child’s bravery to come forward must be met with the right support. And for many of our most vulnerable children, that support is not available.”\nHe welcomed the Government’s commitment to invest £1.4 billion into children’s mental health services but said: “This money can only be spent once; it is crucial that a portion is made available for abused children.

As a result, many have been sent correspondence stating that the Home Office believe them to be of questionable character and that they represent a threat to national security.\nDuring the exchange, Thewliss urged Ministers to take this matter up with their colleagues in the Home Office.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“The Treasury have confirmed to me today that it is entirely reasonable and sensible for people to make legitimate corrections and amendments to their tax returns. Yet, in the case of skilled migrants, these are the very actions being interpreted by the Home Office as somehow unacceptable.\n“From the Minister’s response today, it’s manifestly clear that there is a lack of joined up thinking across government. Many of the individuals affected by this merciless policy are working in highly skilled occupations, and have put down roots in this country and contributed greatly both to their communities and to the economy.\n“The UK Government should be doing its utmost to make the UK an attractive place for these people to stay, instead it is actively presiding over a hostile environment policy which is ruining people’s lives.\n“I urge the Treasury to bring what pressure it can to bear on the Home Office, to make clear that legitimately correcting a tax return should not later lead to a threat of removal from the UK”.",

  "http_www_alisonthewliss_scot/http_www_alisonthewliss_scot_the-rape-clause-blog-post/content_197.html": "(The below post was published in The Telegraph on 19th January 2016)\nNo woman should have to prove she was raped to be able to claim child tax credits. It’s a dramatic statement, and it’s one that has raised many questions – so perhaps it’s best to go back to the start.\nHidden away on page 88 of Chancellor George Osborne’s Budget in July was a small, almost innocuous sentence, which related to the Government’s plan to restrict the child element of tax credits and Universal Credit – child benefit, essentially – to the first two children:\n“The Department of Work and Pensions and HMRC will develop protections for women who have a third child as a result of rape, or other exceptional circumstances”.\nI read the sentence again. I re-read it. I showed it to the colleague sitting next to me. What did this actually mean? How would DWP and HMRC prove that a child was borne of rape?\nThe more I thought about this, the more furious I became. Rape is a very serious crime, but yet one of the most under-reported and under-convicted crimes there is. It exists in abusive relationships, it exists in marriage. For many women, is traumatic beyond description, and it is something they feel is shameful.\nHow vile that this Government would consider putting a woman, who may already feel extremely vulnerable, in the position where she had to confess to an Government official that her child had been born as a result of rape. How stigmatising, for that woman, for that child and for the family. Piling humiliation on top of pain is not the essence of “protection”.\nI’ve raised this with Ministers at every level of Government, including the Prime Minister himself.\nFor all the questions my colleagues and I have asked since the July budget, there has yet to be an answer as to how this will work, and particularly the burden of proof.\nThe DWP and HMRC are not known for being organisations that will take you at your word; the casework I have seen in my office gives me no confidence in either the competence or the sensitivity of these departments. What hope does a woman in such vulnerable circumstances have? Will they accept her word, or will only a criminal conviction do? We don’t yet know.\nHowever, the real problem at the heart of this is not even the rape clause; it’s the two child policy.\nFor me, it’s tantamount to social engineering. It makes children a financial commodity. It passes judgement and stigmatises.\nIt doesn’t respect the disproportionate impact on those of particular faiths or backgrounds where larger families are the norm. It’s also economic madness, as we need more children to counter our ageing population. And it runs counter to our Government’s obligations to treat children equally under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.\nThe two child policy has not yet been fully explained or justified by this Government, other than in the most tabloid of terms. I’ve heard some suggest in carelessly callous language that you should only have the children you can afford. It does not take account of the fact that you may well be able to “afford” three children when you had them, but not if your circumstances change: what if your partner dies, if you become disabled, if your marriage breaks up?\nWhat happens in the case where families come together with existing children from previous relationships?\nThe Budget claimed multiple births would be protected, but not at which stage; if your first two children are twins, will the third still be eligible, or only if that happens the other way around?\nThese questions and more have been asked by MPs since July, but answers have not been forthcoming.\nThe campaign to scrap the rape clause is gathering pace and many people are already signing the petition, which had almost 6,000 names at the last count. This should, in itself, send a message to the Government that this policy is untenable.\nI very much hope that the Government has realised the mess it has got itself into, and scrap not only this outdated and potentially damaging rape clause – but the whole two child policy itself.",

Independence is the only way Scotland can escape austerity for good.“The fact that almost 335,000 deaths – almost 20,000 in Scotland – are likely to have been caused by UK government policies should serve as a wake up call to the UK government and shame every single Tory to their core, including Douglas Ross and the rest of the Scottish Tories.“The UK government had the opportunity to change course in its recent mini-budget by scrapping debt-inducing policies and bringing in meaningful, targeted support to help low and middle income families get through the cost-of-living crisis. Instead, it chose to confirm Tory austerity 2.0 with more cuts that will threaten our vital NHS and public services, scrap the cap on bankers bonuses and, before u-turning, cut tax for the wealthiest. “It is time for the Scottish Conservative Party to stand up for people in Scotland and help to save lives across the country by denouncing the Tory austerity agenda and calling on their boss to uprate benefits as promised, so people aren’t left cold or hungry.“Scotland hasn’t voted for a Tory government in almost 60 years, yet we have had cruel Tory policy after cruel Tory policy imposed on us – and now we see those same policies are likely causing excess deaths here. It is truly heartbreaking – but we can have a brighter, safer future with independence, which would give us all the powers needed to ensure people weren’t left to go cold and hungry.”",

  "http_www_alisonthewliss_scot/https_www_alisonthewliss_scot_action-to-end-pregnancy-and-maternity-discrimination/content_253.html": "Alison Thewliss MP has called for an end to pregnancy discrimination in the workplace, backing a campaign led by the charity Maternity Action.\nThis week Maternity Action released three videos to empower pregnant women to address pregnancy discrimination in the workplace. Pregnancy discrimination has risen dramatically in the past decade and now affects three quarters of pregnant women and new mothers at work. Research by the Equality and Human Rights Commission has found that 20,000 women each year leave their jobs because of health and safety concerns and 53,000 are discouraged from attending antenatal appointments. A total of 54,000 each year are forced out of work because of unfair and unlawful treatment because of their pregnancy.\nMs Thewliss hosted an event in Westminster on Tuesday 17th January to coincide with the launch of the three videos and took part in a panel discussion with Sarah Champion, Labour MP and Shadow Minister for Women and Equalities, Maria Miller, Conservative MP and Chair of the Women and Equalities Select Committee, Ros Bragg, Chair of Maternity Action, and representatives of the trade union Usdaw.\nCommenting on the launch of the campaign, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“I am delighted to host Maternity Action in Westminster and promote the three new videos to support pregnant women who encounter problems at work. The videos help women to raise concerns with their employer and resolve issues as early as possible and I hope they will become an important resource to support pregnant women in the workplace.\n“It is essential that pregnant women and new mothers have a safe working environment and it is worrying that so many women are encountering problems at work. The EHRC’s research should be a wake-up to politicians from all parties that urgent action is required to tackle pregnancy discrimination and I was delighted to be joined by prominent MPs from Labour and the Conservatives who attended the Maternity Action event in Westminster and pledged their support to the campaign.\n“The SNP-led Scottish Government are already taking action to tackle pregnancy discrimination in workplaces in Scotland and we now need a cross-Government strategy to bring an end to pregnancy discrimination across the UK. There is much more that can be done to deter rogue employers and better protect working women when they are at their most vulnerable.”",

The BHF estimates that 10,000 people die every year as rates of bystander CPR are very low.\nEvery minute without CPR or defibrillation can reduce a person’s chance of surviving a cardiac arrest by around ten per cent.\nAlison Thewliss, MP for Glasgow Central, said:\n“It is worrying to hear the number of lives being lost because rates of bystander CPR in the UK are too low. Every second counts, and CPR really is the difference between life and death.”\n“All young people should have the skills to save a life. I’m supporting first aid skills on the school curriculum as a vital part of the PSHE curriculum.”\nSimon Gillespie, Chief Executive of the British Heart Foundation, said:\n“It’s great to have the support of Alison Thewliss MP in incorporating this life saving skill into the secondary school curriculum. The chance of surviving is almost zero if people collapse and receive no bystander CPR until the emergency services arrive.\n“There is clearly a huge benefit to the public knowing life saving CPR skills, evidenced by the vastly better survival rates from cardiac arrests in countries where CPR is part of the curriculum. Thousands of deaths could be prevented if more people learn CPR.\nI encourage all secondary schools in Glasgow Central to apply for the BHF’s free training kits.”\nMel Fox, Director of Training at St John Ambulance, said:\n“Now’s the time for first aid education to be available to all our young people. Learning CPR and other life saving skills should be part of their passage into adulthood and with many free resources available for schools like our Big First Aid Lesson on 3rd November, there is plenty of opportunity for children to become life savers.”\nJoe Mulligan, head of first aid education at The British Red Cross said:\n“We want all young people to feel confident and willing to help when faced with a first aid emergency. Learning first aid helps to increase confidence levels and we believe it’s a life skill everyone should have.\n“Ultimately the British Red Cross would like everyone to have the opportunity to learn first aid throughout their lives, starting at school, so that a generation of people can be equipped with the skills they need to help in an emergency.\n“Our free teaching resources and workshops are designed to give young people the skills, confidence and willingness to act in an emergency.”",

The cross-party letter, set up by the APPG on Fuel Poverty and Energy Efficiency, has been signed by 40 MPs across a number of parties and has expressed “deep concern” for the UK’s poorest families. Campaign groups and charities have also called for urgent action, with Citizens Advice warning last week that 3.2 million people ran out of credit on their prepayment meter last year due to not being able to afford topping up. The letter comes ahead of Grant Schapps, Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Secretary, being questioned in the Commons on Tuesday about the meters. Commenting, Alison Thewliss MP said: “I echo the views of this letter and urge the Government to act immediately to support the most vulnerable constituents in my constituency. It is clear that this UK Tory Government are falling well short of the mark when it comes to the support being provided already. “This is another shameful policy being introduced by the UK Tory Government, and it sickens me that this decision has been agreed on in the first place. “Both this letter and my colleague Anne McLaughlin’s Ten-Minute Rule Bill on Pre-Payment Meters (Self-Disconnection) highlight the need for immediate action from this Tory Government. “People across my constituency should not be forced onto these prepayment meters, particularly during this difficult cost-of-living crisis. Companies should not be granted the opportunity to put their customers in an inhumane position to choose between heating their homes or feeding their children. “The Government must ban the forced installation of prepayment meters and move vulnerable people off these meters immediately. If the Government does not provide financial support now, then families across the country will be forced into unnecessary poverty.”",

So they find a job but then have the rug pulled from under their feet at the eleventh hour with a sanction.\n“My parliamentary question reveals a serious discrepancy in DWP policy which effectively means it is pot luck whether you get a sympathetic work coach or not. That is no way to run a social security system.\n“I have written to Iain Duncan Smith and demanded that he immediately issues guidance to DWP officials that no-one should be sanctioned in the intervening period of being offered a job and starting work. The UK Government need to shake off this unhealthy obsession with slapping sanctions on people who are just trying to get on in difficult times.\n“It is also time to shine a very bright light back onto the wider issue of sanctions because leaked evidence from the PCS, the civil servants’ union, clearly suggests that they are in fact target driven, despite the Government’s less than convincing claims that they are not. The Secretary of State needs to come clean once and for all and he should make this government’s New Year’s resolution to ditch its unhealthy obsession with sanctions”.",

MPs heard about the action that Together for Short Lives would like the Chancellor of the Exchequer to take to help these vulnerable families when he delivers his Budget on 8 March.\nDuring the reception Ms Thewliss heard from Rachel Thompson, the mother of nine year old Frank who was diagnosed with a rare life-limiting condition when he was just four. Rachel told parliamentarians about the pressures of coordinating Frank’s 24/7 care and the support she and her family receive from their local children’s palliative care services.\nThe reception also saw the launch of the new All-Party Parliamentary Group for Children Who Need Palliative Care. The group will provide an important forum for MPs and Peers to hear about the issues facing these seriously ill children – and what action they can take in Parliament to help.\nChildren with life-limiting conditions require a wide range of professionals working together across different health and care services to support them. Unfortunately, there is a postcode lottery of support for children and their families as many cannot access the care that they need. This is because it is not available in their area or there are not enough professionals with the right skills and experience to care for them.\nAlison Thewliss MP said\n“I really appreciated having the opportunity to hear Frank’s story and to learn about the wonderful support he receives from a range of services, including his local children’s hospice.\n“It was evident at the reception that there is much more to do to help families overcome the serious challenges they face on a day to day basis. I support the charity’s call to make the mobility component of the Disability Living Allowance available to children under three who are dependent on heavy and bulky life support equipment. Currently this benefit is only available to children aged three or over. I look forward to working with Together for Short Lives in Parliament to support children with life-limiting and life-threatening conditions and their families.”\nYou can find out more about Together for Short Lives’ work to transform the lives of children with life-limiting conditions at www.togetherforshortlives.org.uk or join the conversation using #forthe49000.",

Parliamentarians dressed as teal heroes, learned more about the symptoms of ovarian cancer and committed to helping raise awareness. The designated colour for ovarian cancer is teal.\n11 women die every day from ovarian cancer. Early diagnosis saves lives, and raising awareness of the symptoms of ovarian cancer is crucial.\nThe symptoms of ovarian cancer are:\n- Persistent bloating – not bloating that comes and goes\n- Feeling full quickly and/or loss of appetite\n- Pelvic or abdominal pain (that’s your tummy and below)\n- Urinary symptoms (needing to wee more urgently or more often than usual)\nOther symptoms can include unexpected weight loss, changes in bowel habits, and extreme fatigue.\nAlison Thewliss MP commented:\n“Being a ‘teal hero’ was a great opportunity to take action and raise awareness of ovarian cancer. Although there was a fun element to the event, ensuring women know the symptoms of this disease is extremely serious and I plan on continuing to be a teal hero in the future, working to ensure more women are diagnosed sooner.”\nAnnwen Jones, Chief Executive of Target Ovarian Cancer, said:\n“It has been delightful to see the MPs getting involved and learning the symptoms of ovarian cancer. Early diagnosis of ovarian cancer makes the disease easier to treat, so Target Ovarian Cancer is urging everyone to learn the symptoms during Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month this March. Our goal has been to inspire parliamentarians to become more engaged with ovarian cancer and the issues around the disease, and effect change at a national level. We are hugely grateful for all they do.”\nKatherine Taylor, Chief Executive of Ovarian Cancer Action, said:\n“We cannot fight ovarian cancer alone; which is why it is fantastic to see members of parliament showing their support this Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month. We need to educate everyone from politicians, to healthcare professionals, to women and men across the UK to recognise the symptoms of ovarian cancer. Symptoms include persistent stomach pain, persistent bloating, feeling full quickly and needing to wee more often. If you recognise any of these, be as persistent with your GP as your symptoms are with you.”\nAthena Lamnisos, Chief Executive of The Eve Appeal, said:\n“With ovarian cancer it’s about knowing the signs and symptoms so that you can avoid the trauma of a late diagnosis and the grim statistics that go with Stage 3 and 4 disease. That’s why The Eve Appeal know it’s vital to have open conversations about your health and know the signs and symptoms of all the women-specific cancers. With ovarian cancer especially the signs might not automatically lead either a woman or her GP to immediately think of cancer and that’s why arming yourself with information can literally be a life-saver.”\nVictoria Clare, Chief Executive of Ovacome, said:\n“It is great to see so many MPs getting involved in raising awareness of the symptoms of ovarian cancer. By working together to raise awareness we really will make progress in detecting and treating the disease. The women we support are always pleased to see those with influence supporting them and thank you so much to all the MPs who have done so this year.”",

I am delighted that councillors have taken on board the views of residents at today’s hearing, which further exposed the folly of these plans and highlighted the significant misgivings the local community have about this wholly inappropriate development.\n“Whilst today’s decision is excellent news for many residents, it’s clear that significant concerns remain about the saturation of student accommodation in the city centre. Currently there is no means of establishing the need for this type of accommodation, this must be addressed urgently through a comprehensive housing strategy.\n“The SNP understands that Glasgow needs a mixed approach to housing; voting for SNP councillors on 4th May will deliver the high quality housing Glasgow needs for future generations to come.”",

The campaign is calling for a change in the law to prevent the same thing happening to other working people.\nAlison Thewliss MP said:\n“It is shocking to think that if people with terminal illnesses are dismissed or forced out of their jobs that their loved ones will lose the death in service payments that the employee has planned for and earned through a life-time of hard work.”\n“That is why I am proud to have signed the TUC ‘Dying to Work’ charter to protect my employees and I will be encouraging businesses in my constituency to follow suit and sign up to the TUC’s voluntary charter.”\n“In addition, I hope something will soon be done to ensure that every individual with terminal illness will receive the protection and support they deserve.”\nThe campaign has also been endorsed by a number of trade unions and charities, including The National Council for Palliative Care, Hospice UK, Breast Cancer Care and Second Hope.\nTUC Deputy General Secretary Paul Nowak said:\n“Serious illness is tough enough without having to put up with extra hassle at work.

At the time, doing such volunteering was considered in breach of his asylum application conditions and a sign of ‘bad character’. Monongo, who is also a mental health nurse for the NHS, cannot now re-apply for British citizenship until 2020.\nIn light of the guidance which has just been issued, Ms Thewliss is now asking for Ministerial discretion to be used to allow Olivier and his family to apply for British citizenship immediately.\nCommenting, the Glasgow Central MP said:\n“This new guidance makes much clearer that volunteering should not be regarded as a sign of bad character and indeed encouraged. This will be of great comfort to individuals and to the organisations who value the contribution volunteers make.\n“The previous rules were fundamentally flawed and led to an honest and upstanding member of the community being denied British citizenship, simply because he volunteered for the British Red Cross. That is absolutely ridiculous.\n“I’m glad that my debate in Westminster Hall last week highlighted the folly of this policy; I’m very glad to see revised policy being issued to Home Office decision makers. However, I went into Westminster Hall last week with two asks – one was to make sure people can’t be penalised for volunteering and the other was to lift the ban on asylum seekers working. Although I’m pleased that there has been progress on the first issue, I am still going to pursue the wider issue of allowing asylum seekers to take up paid employment, which we know would save the Government tens of millions of pounds.\n“As for my constituent Olivier, I am today writing to the Home Secretary Amber Rudd and asking her to personally intervene and set in motion the process of allowing Olivier and his family to apply for citizenship – not in 2020 but now.”",

Far from showing contrition, the Secretary of State instead posited that the policy offers “double support”.\nA demonstration against the two child policy – one year since its implementation – will be held on Thursday 19 April at 5.30pm, on The Mound, Edinburgh.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“I didn’t think the Tory government could sink any lower on this issue, but they have once again outdone themselves.\n“The Secretary of State is completely out of step with how damaging the two child limit is, and she demonstrated as much with her performance at yesterday’s committee hearing.\n“Charities and agencies are lining up to tell the government how reckless this policy is, that it will push 200,000 children below the poverty line, and that women claiming tax credits for a third child conceived due to rape will have to prove the point during an interview, yet no one wants to listen. This behaviour is inhumane, it is unforgivable.\n“Esther McVey is simply wrong about the rape clause. No woman should be forced to relive the experience of rape simply in order to qualify for tax credits. To endorse the existing process as in some way beneficial to the claimant is simply staggering.\n“The issue of rape is an incredibly sensitive one, and it is not being treated as such by this Tory government. The very fact that women’s aid organisations in Scotland are refusing to act as third-party referrers should be ringing serious alarm bells about the policy’s viability.\n“Unfortunately for the government, opposition to this pernicious policy continues to grow, and I look forward to joining with charities, agencies and demonstrators at the protest on Thursday. The government has performed various U-turns in recent weeks, without doubt the two child limit and rape clause should be its next. To this end I have written to the Secretary of State to ask that she meet with me, and women’s aid groups, as a matter of urgency”.",

This demonstrated a blatant ignorance of the dehumanising nature of domestic and sexual abuse.\n“The 2015 budget document suggested that the DWP would develop “protections” for women with more than two children, when that third child was conceived as a result of rape. Despite pressing Lord Freud on this, it was clear the Government don’t really know in practice how such a policy would work.\n“For example, would a woman have to prove that she had conceived a child as a result of rape? If so, who would arbitrate on that? Would that information be retained on her DWP files? If so, would all and any DWP staff be able to access that information?\n“It was suggested by the Government during the meeting that a letter be issued to survivors of rape which they could keep to prove they were exempt from the two child policy and could be presented as and when required. Does the UK Government genuinely think this is appropriate?\n“One question this Government can’t answer is how limiting tax credits to two children per family fits in with its family test for policy. Put simply, this policy is anti-family and will stigmatise children.\n“I’ve already had conversations with faith leaders who believe that this policy would directly discriminate families who, for religious reasons, might have larger families.\n“There are just far too many unanswered questions and concerns around this policy; the Government wrote to me and confirmed that they still hadn’t figured out the detail of how their plans could be implemented.\n“Theresa May’s new Government hasn’t been shy about making policy u-turns and ditching some of David Cameron and George Osborne’s prized policies. The rape clause and two child policy should be next to be thrown onto this new Government’s bonfire and I’m giving Ministers that very opportunity today, when they can come to the chamber and scrap these wicked plans.”",

The company had its licence stripped by the Gambling Commission and was forced to enter administration.\nIt has been estimated that customers collectively have over £90 million in open stakes trapped in the platform following its collapse – leaving average losses of around £3,000 per customer.\nFollowing confirmation that a debate would be taking place on the company, Thewliss has demanded that the time is now to ensure the customers affected by the collapse are compensated for.\nAlison Thewliss MP said:\n“The Government have been tiptoeing around the issue of Football Index for over a year now. Constituents in Glasgow Central have contacted my office and explained the distress they felt, having invested significant money into the company. They now feel completely betrayed by the lack of support following the collapse, and frustrated by the lack of action by regulators.\n“A support package must be put in place for victims of the scandal, particularly given the precedent set by the UK Government on the London Capital and Finance failure. It is entirely unfair that those who continue to have money locked away in the accounts of the now-collapsed firm are being left in the dark.\n“There remains a real worry that scandals such as Football Index could be repeated unless action is taken by the Gambling Commission. The Government must acknowledge the recommendations made by Michael Sheehan QC and implement these as soon as possible.\n“I am deeply disappointed that the Minister didn’t recognise that the Football Index scandal isn’t about people being compensated for gambling losses – it is a clear failure in regulation. On that basis, compensation should be due to those that have lost their life savings to a government-regulated Ponzi scheme.”",

Mr O’Donnell explained that he had been pursuing the PIP claim for several years but was yet to receive any answer on the matter.\nThe constituent asked for a Legal Entitlements and Administrative Practices (LEAP) review as he believed his mobility element may have been miscalculated due to having agoraphobia.\nA letter from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) was sent to confirm that the matter was being investigated and an update would be provided in due course.\nAfter years of patience, Mr O’Donnell was informed by the DWP that he would be given a payment of £9191.41. This payment was calculated using the PIP payments he received and those he is now entitled to for the period 23 March 2016 until 7 June 2022.\nCommenting on his delight at receiving this payment, Michael O’Donnell said:\n“I can’t thank Alison and her team enough for the support they have given me in this case. The patience and dedication shown by the team is something which I am extremely grateful for.\n“I have been trying for years to get this PIP payment but to get it after such a long period of waiting has been such a relief.\n“The amount of money I have received is truly life-changing and will help greatly in the lead up to Christmas.\n“Since getting this money, I have spoken with several friends to urge them to speak with Alison about any issue they have due to how helpful she has been in this process.\n“The process was much easier than I expected, and I will be forever grateful to the team for making sure that I was given this life-changing amount of money.”\nCommenting on this case, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“I am so happy that Michael was able to receive this payment.

The parents of the baby, who are Iranian nationals living in Glasgow, had wanted the child’s Iranian Grandmother to be able to visit at the time of the birth. The Grandmother, who lives in Tehran, started trying to apply for her visa in May 2016 – almost half a year before the baby was due. She has still not been granted an opportunity to apply for a visa, despite her new grandchild now being three months old.\nIn a letter to MP Alison Thewliss, the Home Office advised that the Grandmother might instead wish to apply in person for a visa from VFS Global’s Abu Dhabi processing centre – a journey which would require her to cross the Persian Gulf. Another case Ms Thewliss is dealing with means that a married couple are currently being kept apart. The husband remains in Glasgow, with his wife stuck in Iran, unable to apply to come to the UK.\nJust 30 visa application slots – administered by the UK Government’s private contractor, VFS Global – are issued once a week, every Tuesday at 1pm. They are issued on a first come, first served basis. The application slots do not guarantee a visa but merely the opportunity to apply for one. Thewliss has branded this “an immigration system which appears to be run like a tombola”. The Glasgow Central MP recently secured a meeting with the UK Immigration Minister, Robert Goodwill and will press these cases today.\nSpeaking ahead of the meeting at the Home Office in London, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“Because of a bizarre policy put in place by the Home Office, I have families in my constituency who are being kept apart due to an immigration system which appears to be run like a tombola.\n“From my own constituency casework, it is clear that this approach to administering visas is simply not fit for purpose.\n“Amongst the draconian restrictions, quotas and red tape put in place by the Home Office’s private contractor, I am seeing honest and well-intentioned people being stonewalled from even being able to apply for visas, let alone visit their family.\n“During last summer, Downing Street issued a woolly press statement talking up the Government’s desire to forge greater links and cooperation with Iran. This press statement followed a telephone call between the new Prime Minister, Theresa May and the Iranian President, Dr Hassan Rouhani. One of the ironies in all of this is that the Iranian President is himself a former student of Glasgow Caledonian University, where he completed a postgraduate qualification in the city in the 1990s.\n“If the UK Government is serious about improving relations and cooperation with Iran, it could start by urgently reviewing and reforming this bizarre system of issuing visa application appointments based on luck of the draw.“",

In March 2016, the UK Government promised to bring forward legislation to scrap the tampon tax by changing the bands at which VAT is applied to tampons and sanitary products.\nHowever, over a year since the UK Government promised new laws to remove VAT on tampons and sanitary products, they remain subject to 5% VAT and no legislation has been brought before Parliament to end the tampon tax.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“I am pleased that the Co-op have joined several other major retailers in paying the cost of the tampon tax for their customers. However, retailers should not need to mitigate the cost of an unjust tax that the UK Government has already promised to scrap.\n“It is appalling that, over a year since the UK Government promised to end the injustice of taxing periods, no draft legislation has been brought to the House of Commons to remove VAT from tampons and sanitary products. This issue has been running on for far too long and too many women are still being taxed for their periods, despite the commitments of some retailers to shield their customers from the tampon tax.\n“The only way to guarantee that all women will benefit from the tampon tax being axed is for new laws to be brought in without further delay. The Chancellor must now come to Parliament with a clear plan and timetable to end this unjust tax once and for all.”",

This year the initiative follows on naturally from the inaugural First Minister’s Reading Challenge which runs during term time, helping to contribute to a continuation of children’s reading in the break from school.\nResearch shows that reading for pleasure is a more powerful factor in life achievement than socio-economic background, and that children who use libraries are twice as likely to be above average readers.\nThe Challenge is a unique partnership between The Reading Agency and public libraries across the UK which last year got over three quarters of a million children borrowing, reading and talking about their favourite books.\nThis year’s challenge theme is Animal Agents, based on a detective agency staffed by all kinds of clever animals – furry, scaly and slippery – who are out to crack a case with a little help from their friends. Tony Ross, the UK’s best-selling children’s illustrator (including creator of the Little Princess books, illustrator of the Horrid Henry series by Francesca Simon, and books by David Walliams and Claire Balding), has created this year’s exclusive artwork.\nTo take part, all children need to do is to head to their local library where they will be given a collector folder to keep a record of their reading journey. Children that read at least six library books over the summer, will collect stickers which will give them helpful clues to crack the case and help the Animal Agents find out what’s really been going on!\nAlison Thewliss MP said: “I hope parents, grandparents and carers in Glasgow will take their children to the library over the summer to sign up for the Tesco Bank Summer Reading Challenge Scotland.

She found out that, in Glasgow Central constituency, 6800 people are diagnosed with cancer each year, underlining the need for MPs to join the fight against the disease.\nCommenting after the event, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“We must not underestimate the devastating impact cancer will have on people in Glasgow now and in the future, so it gives me hope to hear that Cancer Research UK’s pioneering research is turning the tables on the disease.\n“The outlook for new and better cancer treatments in the UK is bright. However, it is clear that there is a critical role for politicians to play in helping to prevent and detect cancer earlier and bring innovative new treatments to patients faster.\n“One life lost to this terrible disease is one too many and that’s why I’m supporting Cancer Research UK in their mission to beat cancer sooner.”\nMatt Davies, Cancer Research UK’s Head of Public Affairs and Campaigning said:\n“At Cancer Research UK, we’re resolute in our ambition to see 3 in 4 patients surviving cancer by 2034. To achieve this we need cancer at the top of the political agenda and so we’re grateful to (insert name) MP for helping to highlight the importance of research and action in beating the disease.\n“Survival in the UK has doubled in the last 40 years. But there’s still so much more to do and we cannot do it alone.\n“Creating the right environment for cancer research alongside cancer prevention, early diagnosis and ensuring patients have access to the best possible treatments must be key priorities for the new Government.”",
  "http_www_alisonthewliss_scot/https_www_alisonthewliss_scot_category_campaigns_page_4/content_519.html": "New research from Scottish Gas has highlighted that having no heating or hot water would be the number one disaster for households in Scotland this winter. Even so, many people in Glasgow have not taken action to ensure their homes are winter-ready.\nDespite the autumn chill, a national survey* shows that more than a third of households (35%) in Scotland have not checked that their central heating is working and nearly four in ten have not prepared their home for winter by getting their boiler serviced. Having an annual boiler service carried out by a Gas Safe registered engineer is crucial as it detects problems with the boiler and controls, including whether it is leaking poisonous carbon monoxide.\nKeeping homes safe is an important part of winter preparation, yet only four in ten households in Scotland have checked that their carbon monoxide alarm is working. Carbon monoxide is known as the ‘silent killer’, because the gas has no odour or taste, and is invisible. Fitting an audible alarm is the second line of defence against carbon monoxide poisoning.\nBeing energy efficient is particularly important during the winter months, and technology can help with this. Whilst more than half of households in Scotland (51%) acknowledge that technology could help their home to run more smoothly during winter, less than a third (32%) have smart meters.\nHaving smart meters installed can help keep household energy in check, as they automatically send readings to the energy supplier. Smart meters also come with a display that shows you how much energy is being used, in pounds and pence, in near real-time, and identify where savings can be made.\nAlison Thewliss MP said: “It’s really important to keep a step ahead of winter. I want everyone in Glasgow to understand what help is available for them, and for their family and friends. Being energy efficient and keeping bills under control is really important, so I’d encourage people to get in touch with their energy supplier to find out what support is on offer.”\nScottish Gas engineer Stephen Cosgrove, who fixes and repairs boilers, said: “Winter can be a challenging time for households, but there are some practical steps that you can take, with our help, to make sure that you are prepared:\nGet the best deal\nWe have been working hard to ensure buying energy is simple, transparent and fair for customers – for every customer on a standard variable tariff they will get an Annual Energy Health Check to make sure they’re on the right tariff. This will highlight other ways we can help our customers save money like replacing old and inefficient boilers or insulating their homes for free.\nGet smart meters\nYour energy supplier will be able to install smart meters, which mean an end to estimated bills. A smart energy monitor shows how much energy you are using, and what you are spending. Scottish Gas customers are provided with online tools to help them manage their energy usage. Find out more by visiting www.britishgas.co.uk/smartmeters\nThe Scottish Gas Energy Trust\nThis independent trust gives face-to-face advice, financial support and grants to help clear energy and household debts. The average grant is around £600 and you don’t have to be a Scottish Gas customer. Find out more by visiting: www.britishgasenergytrust.org.uk.\nBleed your radiators: to make sure they are working properly. If your radiators have cold spots at the top, this means you have air in the system, so you will need to bleed them to get them working efficiently.\na. To do this, turn the system off and when cool turn the radiator key until the air stops and water runs consistently. Once you have turned the system back on, the problem should be solved.\nb. Cold spots in the bottom or centre of the radiator may be an indication of sludge build up and the need for system flushing.\nc. Bleeding your radiator may result in pressure dropping. If you have a pressure gauge, make sure the boiler is at the right pressure and top up as necessary.\nBlock the breeze: Make sure all of your windows and doors seal properly to stop warm air escaping. For those that don’t, fitting draught excluders, which you can buy from most DIY stores, is a quick and cheap way to cut down on your energy bills.\nStay safe: It’s vital to have a carbon monoxide alarm fitted and that you test it regularly.\nLove your boiler: Check to make sure that your boiler is working properly before winter sets in. The older your boiler, the more inefficient it will be. If you have a pressure gauge, make sure the boiler is at the right pressure and top up as necessary.\nInsulate your pipes: Burst pipes are a huge issue during winter months.

In total, more than half a million people are currently on the Anthony Nolan register and the average per constituency is 905.\nNow Alison Thewliss is encouraging more 16 to 30-year-olds to sign up. She says it is particularly important that young men and people from ethnic minorities join the register as they are currently under-represented.\nThe blood cancer charity Anthony Nolan created the world’s first stem cell donor register, and has been saving lives for over four decades by matching remarkable people willing to donate their bone marrow or stem cells to patients in desperate need of a transplant. It also carries out pioneering research to increase stem cell transplant success, and supports patients through their transplant journeys.\nTwo thirds of UK patients will not find a matching donor from within their families; instead they turn to Anthony Nolan to find them an unrelated donor.\nAnthony Nolan wants to give people the very best chance of life by finding the best possible match for them. But the charity can currently only find a perfect match for 60 per cent of transplant recipients, so they still urgently need more people to come forward.\nMs Thewliss said:\n“I am delighted that 1379 people in Glasgow Central constituency are registered on the Anthony Nolan stem cell register. It is fantastic to see that there are so many heroic and selfless people in my constituency.\n“I hope that more local people will also now be inspired to sign up and to become potential lifesavers for people in desperate need.”\nAnn O’Leary, Head of Register Development at Anthony Nolan, said:\n‘We are delighted that Alison Thewliss has been inspired to encourage others to sign up as donors. Donating is an incredibly selfless thing to do and will give someone with blood cancer the best possible chance of survival. What many people don’t realise is that it is also surprisingly simple.’\nTo join the Anthony Nolan register you must be 16-30 and in good health. It involves filling out a simple online form and spitting into a tube. About 90% of people who are asked to donate will do so through a process similar to giving blood.\nThe charity needs supporters of all ages to champion the register at a local level and help us spread the word – from schools, communities and workplaces to your own friends and family.

The Bill, presented by Geraint Davies MP, follows a report from the Royal Colleges that diesel fumes cause 40,000 premature deaths every year from lung cancer, strokes and heart disease. Diesel fumes also lead to underdevelopment in children and impact on foetuses, among other health effects.\nThe Air Quality Bill makes provisions for emissions testing to reflect on-road driving conditions, and assessment at the point of MOTs. The Bill also empowers local authorities to designate low emissions zones and pedestrianisation, and promotes cleaner public transport alternatives such as tram systems and LPG-powered vehicles.\nThe Environment Agency would be able to step in when a pollution cloud has hit an area, so that windows, doors and even roads can be closed, and if necessary local people evacuated until it is safe to return.\nAlison Thewliss MP said, “Diesel pollution causes 40,000 deaths a year, and costs £20bn according to the Royal College of Physicians. That is why I am supporting the Air Quality Bill, published today, which aims to save thousands of lives and billions of pounds. This is achieved through effective emissions testing, following the Volkswagen emissions scandal and promoting greener transport systems and vehicles.\n“Local residents in Glasgow are rightly concerned about their children coughing and wheezing, especially if children are already asthmatic. We now know that these health effects, and indeed thousands of deaths, are caused by toxic diesel fumes, which is why I am keen to support this important Bill.”\nGeraint Davies MP, who published the Bill, said “Our cities are pumping out diesel clouds which threaten the lives of families, in particular young children and unborn babies. The Bill will ensure reliable vehicle emissions testing, new powers for councils to clean up local air, and a focus in the Budget on sustainable transport. This will help save thousands of lives and billions of pounds lost to diesel pollution.”\nDr Penny Woods, Chief Executive of the British Lung Foundation, said: “Air pollution causes tens of thousands of early deaths every year, increases the risk of lung cancer and impairs child lung development. Geraint Davies’ Bill further highlights these unacceptable dangers to the nation’s lung health. Immediate action must be taken by the government.”",
  "http_www_alisonthewliss_scot/https_www_alisonthewliss_scot_category_constituency_page_7/content_705.html": "New research from Scottish Gas has highlighted that having no heating or hot water would be the number one disaster for households in Scotland this winter. Even so, many people in Glasgow have not taken action to ensure their homes are winter-ready.\nDespite the autumn chill, a national survey* shows that more than a third of households (35%) in Scotland have not checked that their central heating is working and nearly four in ten have not prepared their home for winter by getting their boiler serviced. Having an annual boiler service carried out by a Gas Safe registered engineer is crucial as it detects problems with the boiler and controls, including whether it is leaking poisonous carbon monoxide.\nKeeping homes safe is an important part of winter preparation, yet only four in ten households in Scotland have checked that their carbon monoxide alarm is working. Carbon monoxide is known as the ‘silent killer’, because the gas has no odour or taste, and is invisible. Fitting an audible alarm is the second line of defence against carbon monoxide poisoning.\nBeing energy efficient is particularly important during the winter months, and technology can help with this. Whilst more than half of households in Scotland (51%) acknowledge that technology could help their home to run more smoothly during winter, less than a third (32%) have smart meters.\nHaving smart meters installed can help keep household energy in check, as they automatically send readings to the energy supplier. Smart meters also come with a display that shows you how much energy is being used, in pounds and pence, in near real-time, and identify where savings can be made.\nAlison Thewliss MP said: “It’s really important to keep a step ahead of winter. I want everyone in Glasgow to understand what help is available for them, and for their family and friends. Being energy efficient and keeping bills under control is really important, so I’d encourage people to get in touch with their energy supplier to find out what support is on offer.”\nScottish Gas engineer Stephen Cosgrove, who fixes and repairs boilers, said: “Winter can be a challenging time for households, but there are some practical steps that you can take, with our help, to make sure that you are prepared:\nGet the best deal\nWe have been working hard to ensure buying energy is simple, transparent and fair for customers – for every customer on a standard variable tariff they will get an Annual Energy Health Check to make sure they’re on the right tariff. This will highlight other ways we can help our customers save money like replacing old and inefficient boilers or insulating their homes for free.\nGet smart meters\nYour energy supplier will be able to install smart meters, which mean an end to estimated bills. A smart energy monitor shows how much energy you are using, and what you are spending. Scottish Gas customers are provided with online tools to help them manage their energy usage.

If your radiators have cold spots at the top, this means you have air in the system, so you will need to bleed them to get them working efficiently.\na. To do this, turn the system off and when cool turn the radiator key until the air stops and water runs consistently. Once you have turned the system back on, the problem should be solved.\nb. Cold spots in the bottom or centre of the radiator may be an indication of sludge build up and the need for system flushing.\nc. Bleeding your radiator may result in pressure dropping. If you have a pressure gauge, make sure the boiler is at the right pressure and top up as necessary.\nBlock the breeze: Make sure all of your windows and doors seal properly to stop warm air escaping. For those that don’t, fitting draught excluders, which you can buy from most DIY stores, is a quick and cheap way to cut down on your energy bills.\nStay safe: It’s vital to have a carbon monoxide alarm fitted and that you test it regularly.\nLove your boiler: Check to make sure that your boiler is working properly before winter sets in. The older your boiler, the more inefficient it will be.

Following that, she wrote a scathing letter to the former Prime Minister David Cameron, urging him to make tackling low pay a priority.\nCommenting, Glasgow Central SNP MP Alison Thewliss said:\n“Last summer might have seen a change of occupant in 10 Downing Street but it appears to be business as usual for this Tory Government; they appear to have no interest whatsoever in tackling pay inequality and exploitation. Theresa May’s impassioned speech on the steps of Downing Street has been exposed again and again as empty rhetoric.\n“Disappointingly, when I obtained last year’s data from the Government, over 100,000 Scots were still being paid below the national minimum wage. This is in stark contrast to the Scottish Government, and huge swathes of Scotland’s public services, who pay the real living wage of £8.45 per hour.\n“House of Commons Library figures reveal that for 2015-16 alone 950 employers have been found by HMRC not to be paying the minimum wage. Over the past decade only 13 prosecutions have taken place for non-compliance, which simply beggars belief.\n“These shocking figures also show that the Government is doing very little to crack down on employers who aren’t complying with National Minimum Wage legislation passed almost two decades ago. Indeed, the Minister’s response reveals the Government don’t think it’s worth prosecuting companies for non-compliance. This sends an incredibly worrying signal to exploitative employers who will think it is perfectly acceptable to pay peanuts for a fair day’s work.\n“If Theresa May is truly serious about supporting the “just about managing” in society, she needs to implement an urgent action plan.\n“The Prime Minister should start by cracking down heavily on exploitative employers who are flouting minimum wage laws. Companies won’t take this matter seriously if all they can expect is a rap on the knuckles.\n“Theresa May should implement a real living wage, as set by the Living Wage Foundation, rather than the pale imitation being punted by her Chancellor. The real Living Wage is being successfully promoted by the Scottish Government, with Scottish Canals being announced just this week as the 700th employer in Scotland to sign up.\n“Thirdly, and as part of an action plan, we need to have genuine pay equality – not just for women but for young people as well. Currently, the UK Government has a ridiculous system whereby minimum wage rates are set in accordance with age. That means if you’re a sixteen year old apprentice, the law says you can be paid as little as £3.40 per hour. How does that fit into the Prime Minister’s new obsession about a shared society?\n“I’ve written to the Prime Minister setting out three very simple and practical steps she could take to tackle this – I hope sincerely I won’t be sending the same action plan next year when I request these figures from the Government again”.",

I come to this debate with absolutely no judgement or attempt to tell other parents how to feed their children.\n“I believe it is vitally important that parents get accurate information on the contents of formula milk, and the best way to prepare it safely. At present there is a worrying lack of independent scrutiny of infant and young child formula, as well as growing frustration about the industry marketing tricks and misleading claims being pushed on parents and health professionals alike.\n“Misinformation on health policy never ends well and I believe this requires an urgent change in the law, to seriously tighten up the behaviour of some companies.\n“Currently, a loophole allows for misleading and scientifically questionable claims to be printed in reputable and highly respected medical and nursing journals. This is an untenable position and the legislation I am proposing will tackle this issue head on.\n“My bill would also mean that the UK fully implements the international Code of Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes, which has been called for in numerous reports.\n“I am hopeful that the House of Commons approves permission to formally introduce the bill today and let it have a second reading in Parliament.”\nThe Government needs to take responsibility for this, as parents and the general public are very confused – seeing any attempt to protect babies through better legislation as an attack on bottle feeding parents, rather than the reverse. It needs to be highlighted that the formula industry is extremely lucrative and competitive, leading to unsubstantiated claims and the launch of new ‘specialised’ products with little rationale/evidence for their need or effectiveness or safety even, and even lower regulations that for standard Stage 1 formula.",

Now the MP is asking interested parties to submit thoughts and proposals for consideration before 9am on Monday 9th January 2017. After that she will move to drafting the Bill, which will be published early in the new year.\nThe Bill seeks to make provision for the control of advertising and promotion of feeding products for babies and children. The MP intends for the Bill to establish a body – completely independent of industry – which would regularly safety test formula milks and other infant feeding products, and potentially adjudicate on the veracity of claims made by companies as to the ingredients and nutritional value of such products. The Bill aims also to include provision for stiffer financial penalties for formula companies which publish scientifically inaccurate and misleading claims.\nThose interested in responding to the consultation are asked to fill out a short consultation form.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“I have been overwhelmed by the support and good wishes of so many people who have a wealth of knowledge around infant feeding. I would encourage as many people as possible to visit my website, fill out the consultation form, and let me know their thoughts as to what might potentially be helpful to include in the Bill.\n“Taking a Ten Minute Rule Bill all the way through to being put on the statute books is a tall order, so I am keen to give the Bill the best possible chance of success.

The Prime Minister advanced that the UK Government has taken care to ensure the issue is dealt with sensitively, with Blackford countering that the clause is a disgrace.\nThe rape clause, or non-consensual sex exemption, has been in place for over a year, and forms part of the government’s wider policy to restrict Tax Credits and Universal Credit (child element) claims to the first two children in a family.\nEarlier this week, McVey defended the government’s record on welfare reform during an evidence hearing of the Social Security Committee at Holyrood.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“It really is repugnant to see the Prime Minister leaping to the Secretary of State’s defence on the issue of the rape clause.\n“Earlier this week Esther McVey described this vile policy as “extra help”, “an opportunity to talk” and “double support”. It is none of these things. By supporting it, the Prime Minister and her government are complicit in putting vulnerable women in harm’s way.\n“Experts in violence against women recognise that forced disclosure of abuse brings a significant risk of reliving that trauma. This should always be at a time of a woman’s choosing, not at the point where she has to make a choice about putting food on the table to feed her children.\n“Any defence of the two child limit and rape clause is truly reprehensible. The entire policy is ill-judged, cruel, and has nothing to do with supporting women. It must be scrapped.\n“I hope the Secretary of State will reflect on her words, and respond to my request for an urgent meeting without delay”.",

Over a year on from announcing it, they still don’t know how it could be implemented.\n“A parliamentary debate, change in personnel in Government, as well as the forthcoming Autumn Statement, means that Theresa May has plenty of opportunities to do the right thing, stand up for vulnerable women and scrap the rape clause.\n“This needn’t be about saving face for the Prime Minister. It’s about this Prime Minister standing up for other women, doing the decent thing and getting shot of this wicked policy agenda”.",

My thoughts are with everyone who has lost a loved one to drugs.\n“This reduction in deaths should serve as a catalyst for even greater efforts to provide assistance and opportunities for recovery to those who need it most. The root causes of substance abuse, such as poverty, homelessness, and lack of access to education and employment have been exacerbated by over a decade of austerity.\n“It is not acceptable for the UK Government to sit on their hands and block efforts to provide harm reduction initiatives such as safe consumption facilities in Glasgow. The Misuse of Drugs Act must be urgently reviewed, as it is a barrier to saving lives and tackling the harms associated with drug use.\n“The stigma associated with drug use not only prevents individuals from seeking help but also causes a cycle of shame and isolation. By treating people who use drugs with compassion and respect, we can create an environment where they feel safe to reach out for support.\n“Recovery communities have made a significant contribution, building a network of grassroots support. The Scottish Government’s public health approach rightly focuses on providing accessible and effective treatment options, harm reduction strategies, and mental health services. Increasing the availability of life-saving Naloxone treatment has saved lives, and I would encourage more people to get trained on how to use it.\n“I firmly support the Scottish Government’s proposals to decriminalise drugs for personal use. We must learn from good practice around the world; nothing should be off the table for tackling this issue which has already cost so many lives and devastated so many families.”",

She has written back to him to ask for a face-to-face meeting in Downing Street to press key questions which still cause major concern.\nDowning Street initially responded to say that the Prime Minister had asked Treasury Ministers to deal with Ms Thewliss’ letter and questions. However, this week she received a further personal response from the Prime Minister, which suggests that the Government is “thinking very carefully” about how it responds to this “sensitive issue”.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“Enormous questions still remain unanswered. It is significant that this issue is now being dealt with personally by David Cameron and it represents a major breakthrough in the campaign to scrap the rape clause. I’m grateful to all who have helped put pressure on the Prime Minister thus far.\n“I have written to ask David Cameron if he will personally meet with me to answer a number of key questions which remain unanswered and continue to cause serious concern amongst women’s welfare groups.\n“In the Lords Report Stage of the Welfare Reform Bill, Lord Freud specifically ruled out an exemption for women who conceive a child in an abusive relationship. We know that the majority of rapes take place within relationships and the majority of abusive relationships also involve sexual coercion. What about women who are raped within marriage and later leave and have to claim benefits?\n“There are still major questions about the burden of proof. The DWP are not known for taking people’s word on a range of issues and I don’t have any confidence that they will be able to treat women sensitively.\n“We still don’t know what the regulations will look like but my caseload shows evidence of some poor decision making and cases later being overturned. If this was to be the case for a woman who has been the victim of abuse and rape, this will only add to the trauma and indignity of her experience.\n“The more this issue rumbles on, the more convinced I am that both the two child policy and rape clause are completely unworkable. This isn’t about point scoring or getting one-up over the Government – it’s about doing what’s right and ditching a proposal that has the potential to cause enormous distress to vulnerable women.”",

She initially tabled amendments during committee consideration of last year’s Finance Bill and the SNP was the only major party in the 2015 election to have a specific manifesto commitment to abolish the tampon tax.\nNext week MPs from the SNP, Labour, Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats will force a vote in the House of Commons which could end the “deeply unjust tax on periods”.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“Now is the time end, once and for all, the deeply unjust tax on periods.\n“It is estimated that the UK Treasury generates £15 million a year in VAT from the sale of essential ladies sanitary products. Tampons are not a luxury item – they are a basic requirement for women and should not be subject to tax.\n“Up until now the UK Government has suggested that a change in the law to abolish the tax wouldn’t be possible due to EU rules and I’ve been willing, to some extent, to allow them the space to negotiate this with the European Commission, however, there has been speculation that a decision on this will be forthcoming in the very near future, therefore we’re going to press this to vote next week, in the hope we can force substantial action on an issue that has run on far too long.”",

She has also pointed out the Government’s poor preparations for implementing the policy, with no additional training offered for the thousands of healthcare professionals, police officers and social workers who will be tasked with carrying out assessments of vulnerable women and arbitrating on whether or not their circumstances are consistent with rape.\nCommenting prior to the Budget Statement, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“With under a month left until the two child policy and rape clause comes into force, it remains the case that this policy is immoral and unworkable. The public have had their say and they are clear – this policy stigmatises vulnerable women and must be consigned to the Downing Street dustbin.\n“Serious questions remain about the implementation of the policy, with hundreds of thousands of third party professionals left without the promised training in the policy, and growing opposition from civil servants’ unions. The UK Government is still to introduce the necessary legislation to allow the policy to proceed in 23 days’ time, which underlines my belief that Ministers are slowly realising that this policy is a cruel and unfeasible way to cut benefits.\n“With his upcoming budget, the Chancellor has a critical opportunity to save face for this heartless Government and ditch the two child policy and rape clause.

Tory Ministers last week quietly used a negative statutory instrument to try and railroad the rape clause onto the statute books without a parliamentary debate or vote.\nThe Government has stated that it will expect nurses, doctors and social workers to act as third party arbitrators. This means that public service workers will have to judge whether or not a child has been conceived as a result of rape, simply in order for a woman to be exempt from the two child policy. Recent parliamentary answers given to Alison Thewliss MP suggest that the over 660,000 nurses, doctors and social workers in the UK have not been given adequate sexual violence awareness training to exercise the exemption.\nCommenting after Mr Speaker rejected her application, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“For 18 months, I’ve pursued this Tory Government relentlessly on its plan to introduce a pernicious two child policy and medieval rape clause. Today’s decision not to allow the emergency debate is incredibly frustrating, but I won’t just give up.\n“In determining that my application did not merit an emergency debate, the Speaker noted that I had tabled an arcane motion of prayer to annul the law – indeed, at the advice of Commons clerks. What the Speaker did not say was that the last time such a motion of prayer worked was in 1979. This is just one example of the many ways in which the procedures of the House of Commons are so arcane, irrelevant and medieval that it fails the people we, as MPs, seek to represent.\n“The clock is ticking; the rape clause is due to come into force in the next couple of weeks but I’ll keep on working to make this Government think again.”\nI was a social worker (in Probation) for 25 years before I had to take ill health retirement, Ive met perpetrators and survivors. I understand the issues around DV and sexual violence. But because I retired before the requirement to be registered, I would not be allowed to assist women with their applications, even if I was prepared to get involved with this atrocious and intrusive piece of legislation. I wish there was a way to get this overturned asap. A “prayer” has been tabled against the regulations, so what does that mean in the great scheme of things.

It is particularly dangerous for people with visual impairments, parents with pushchairs, wheelchair users and other disabled people.\nAccording to a Guide Dogs survey, 98% of people with a vision impairment in Scotland encountered obstacles on the pavement and 88% of them have had problems with pavement parked cars specifically. Guide Dogs Scotland campaigns against problem pavement parking to make sure that blind and partially sighted people can get out and about independently.\nAlison Thewliss MP commented:\n“Our streets must be accessible to all our citizens and I am delighted to give my support to Guide Dogs Scotland in their campaign to tackle street clutter. The SNP in government have already taken action to tackle the most common obstacles facing blind and visually impaired people – including significant changes to the commercial bin arrangements in Glasgow which will see a reduction in the visibility of large commercial bins, thereby reducing clutter and making the city’s streets more attractive for everyone.\n“I regularly receive complaints from my constituents about inconsiderate parking and I am hopeful that the SNP Scottish Government will adopt the proposals put forward by my colleague Sandra White MSP to ban unsafe pavement parking, thereby making the streets safer for all but especially those who are blind and visually impaired and rely on clear, obstacle-free pavements to navigate through everyday life.”\nNiall Foley, Engagement Manager at Guide Dogs Scotland, commented:\n“It is terrifying for someone who cannot see oncoming traffic or has small children with them to take the risk of stepping out into a road because of cars parked on the pavement. Everyone should be able to walk the streets without fear.\n“We welcome Transport Scotland’s work on a law to curb unsafe pavement parking and are looking forward to seeing a prohibition of unsafe pavement parking as part of the Transport Bill in the near future.”",
  "http_www_alisonthewliss_scot/https_www_alisonthewliss_scot_alison-thewliss-mp-pledges-support-for-diabetes-uk-food-labelling-campaign/content_464.html": "Alison Thewliss, MP for Glasgow Central, has lent their support to a campaign from leading charity Diabetes UK, calling for the public to be given clear nutritional information in restaurants, cafes and takeaways, as well as on the front of all pre-packaged food and drinks.\nMs Thewliss made the pledge at a parliamentary event hosted by the charity as part of its ongoing Food Upfront campaign. Through the campaign, Diabetes UK is making the following calls to government:\n- Mandatory front-of-pack traffic light labelling on all pre-packed foods and drinks sold in the UK,\n- Mandatory calorie labelling on menus in key high street restaurants, cafes and takeaways, with carb content available online or when you ask for it in store,\n- Ensure carbohydrates are labelled on the back of products, per portion and as prepared.\nClear food labelling is vital for millions of people living with diabetes, to help them manage their condition and reduce their risk of serious complications. In a 2017 survey of more than 9,000 people living with or affected by diabetes, almost three quarters of respondents (73%) said that if all companies used the same food labelling system it would help them to make healthier choices.\nClear food labelling also helps the wider public, with or without diabetes, make more informed decisions about what they eat and drink. Recent public polling carried out by ComRes on behalf of\nDiabetes UK revealed that 9 out of 10 people said traffic-light food labelling helps them make healthier decisions, while only three in ten people (29%) said they felt they had enough information about what’s in their food.\nIn addition, more than three quarters of people (76%) said that cafes, restaurants and takeaways should display calorie information on their menus, so that customers understand the content of the food and drink they buy.\nTraffic-light labelling assigns a red, amber or green value in relation to fat, saturated fat, sugar and salt, as well as giving information on the calories in a product, to help consumers find out what’s in the food and drink they’re buying. Evidence shows that both front-of-pack traffic light labelling and calorie labelling informs consumers and helps making the healthier choice the easier choice.\nHowever, clear and consistent food labelling is not currently compulsory. Companies don’t have to provide any information on the front of their goods, and one in three products in shops don’t have clear traffic-light labels. Many restaurants, cafes and takeaways also still do not provide calorie labelling on their menus or other nutritional information online or when asked for it in store.\nCommenting on the campaign, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“The public have made it clear that they support clearer labelling on food and drink to help them make healthier and better informed decisions about what they eat, so I’m happy to lend my support to Diabetes UK’s Food Upfront campaign.\n“Putting these simple measures into place could make a huge difference to the nation as a whole. Obesity and weight related chronic health conditions – including Type 2 diabetes – continue to rise, and it’s important that we do everything that we can to halt this growing health crisis.”\nHelen Dickens, Assistant Director of Campaigns and Mobilisation at Diabetes UK, said:\n“We know that consistent and clear food labelling can help all of us to make informed choices. For people with diabetes, easy access to clear and consistent labelling, for example on carbohydrate content, is vital to supporting them with their diabetes management.\n“With around two-thirds of adults, and almost a third of children in the UK classed as overweight or obese, and therefore at increased risk of Type 2 diabetes and other chronic health conditions, it’s really important that we have measures in place that help make it easier for all of us to know what’s in the food we’re buying.\n“That’s why we are calling for the government to strengthen and, when possible, introduce mandatory front of pack traffic-light labelling on packaging, and calorie labelling on menus. The British public overwhelmingly support these moves, so we are grateful to Alison Thewliss MP for her efforts in helping put these potentially life-changing measures into practice.”",

That’s more than 1,900 acres of land – 25% of the Glasgow area as a whole.\nProtecting our parks and green spaces is of paramount importance to the health and wellbeing of the city of Glasgow, and many of these themes are picked up in the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) report State of UK Public Parks 2016.\nThe report notes that, even in challenging economic times, where funding for projects and services is being squeezed across all areas of government, regenerating parks enjoys widespread support, with 57% of adults using their local parks at least once a month or more.\nThe Communities and Local Government Committee, of which I am a member, wants to expand on this with our inquiry into public parks across the UK. We want to hear the views of everyone across the UK about the state of their public parks and how they can be improved. Write to us by Friday 30 September to ensure your voice is heard: contact details are on the Parliament website.\nHaving a say\nThe HLF report also notes that the management of parks will increasingly vary as local authorities seek to make savings through the disposal of land and other assets.\nI am clear that this disposal should not be done to satisfy the commercial interests of larger companies, but instead should involve communities at every stage of the parks management process.\nThe Scottish Government’s Community Empowerment Act gives communities powers to purchase surplus assets and request participation in the management and running of community assets. This means they can have the opportunity to exert greater control over their own neighbourhoods and green spaces.\nWith financial backing of the Scottish Land Fund, which supports bids for community purchase of assets, we can address some of the points made about the diversification of management in a bottom-up, community-led fashion.\nGlasgow Green\nCommunity budgeting can also play a role here and there are many successful pilot projects across Glasgow where communities have been able to decide spending priorities for services in their area, including on the creation and management of parks and green spaces.\nIn my own constituency of Glasgow Central I am delighted to have Glasgow Green, the oldest public park, containing the iconic Doulton Fountain, McLennan Arch, People’s Palace and Winter Garden. The park has benefited from over £8million of HLF support for restoration works, and from community groups who support the park’s heritage and development.\nAlongside HLF support, the Friends of Glasgow Green continue to come up with new and innovative uses for the space. In particular, I want to take this opportunity to congratulate Trisha Ingram, Chair of Friends of Glasgow Green and their members and supporters in taking the first steps to raise funds for an outdoor gym in Glasgow Green, which seeks to replace the original equipment which was donated to the park in 1860.\nThey have already raised £12,000 for the new facility and are hoping to double that amount through a crowdfunding campaign.\nMore generally, Glasgow Green benefits from being part of the MyParkScotland network, which helps people to find out what’s going on in their local park. This was one of Nesta’s HLF-supported 11 Rethinking Parks projects. Through the MyParkScotland network Glasgow Green benefits from the chance to donate securely to individual park projects. I would encourage local authorities and independent park trusts across the UK to adopt this feature when planning and managing the financial resources of green spaces.\nCitizen satisfaction\nIt’s clear from the conclusions of the report that, when local authorities and communities are both invested in protecting and maintaining our green spaces, the payoff in terms of citizen satisfaction with public parks and park quality is significant.\nIt’s also clear that, when parks are prioritised by local authorities, citizens and other stakeholders, cities become better and healthier places to live. If cities across the UK are to retain high quality public parks, then we must give communities the opportunity and autonomy to nurture and protect the green spaces they care about, and I pledge to be an “elected champion” for parks and green spaces in my constituency.\nWhile there is a lot of work to do to ensure that park maintenance and quality remains of a high standard, I am confident that Glasgow will continue to live up to its name of “dear green place” for many years to come.",
  "http_www_alisonthewliss_scot/http_www_alisonthewliss_scot_more-cuts-to-disability-benefits-completely-unacceptable/content_532.html": "Alison Thewliss, SNP MP for Glasgow Central, has described planned further cuts to disability benefits as “completely unacceptable” and called for an assurance that disabled people will not be left financially worse off under new proposals from the UK Government.\nThe UK government has announced emergency legislation to change the eligibility criteria for Personal Independence Payment, and overturn the decision of two tribunal rulings against the Department for Work and Pensions last year. The UK Government claims that these changes would reduce spending on disability benefits by £3.7 billion. In reality, the changes will deny over 160,000 people access to Personal Independence Payment, cutting vital support which helps people cope with the extra costs of living with disability.\nThese changes come on the back of the comments made by Tory MP and head of the Number 10 Policy Unit George Freeman, who said that the changes would ensure that benefits went to people who are “really disabled” rather than people “who suffer from anxiety”. Mr Freeman’s comments have drawn criticism from disability rights organisations for the insensitive way that he portrayed sufferers of anxiety.\nCommenting on the legislation, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“For a Tory MP, and one of Theresa May’s most senior advisers, to suggest that people with a mental health condition are not “really disabled” is completely unacceptable and wrong. George Freeman’s words highlight this Tory government’s total lack of understanding or compassion when it comes to providing for those who are less fortunate than others.\n“The Tories said there would be no further cuts to disability support during this parliament, but once again they have shown that the price of their failed austerity project is to be borne by those who are least able to afford it.\n“The UK government must urgently clarify what these new proposals will mean for people who currently receive Personal Independence Payment and give a concrete assurance that any changes will not result in a reduction in financial support for disabled people.\n“I have signed the “prayer” motion laid down in the House of Commons to formally object to this legislation and I call on MPs from across the House of Commons to unite in opposition against these changes.”",

This year the initiative follows on naturally from the inaugural First Minister’s Reading Challenge which runs during term time, helping to contribute to a continuation of children’s reading in the break from school.\nResearch shows that reading for pleasure is a more powerful factor in life achievement than socio-economic background, and that children who use libraries are twice as likely to be above average readers.\nThe Challenge is a unique partnership between The Reading Agency and public libraries across the UK which last year got over three quarters of a million children borrowing, reading and talking about their favourite books.\nThis year’s challenge theme is Animal Agents, based on a detective agency staffed by all kinds of clever animals – furry, scaly and slippery – who are out to crack a case with a little help from their friends. Tony Ross, the UK’s best-selling children’s illustrator (including creator of the Little Princess books, illustrator of the Horrid Henry series by Francesca Simon, and books by David Walliams and Claire Balding), has created this year’s exclusive artwork.\nTo take part, all children need to do is to head to their local library where they will be given a collector folder to keep a record of their reading journey. Children that read at least six library books over the summer, will collect stickers which will give them helpful clues to crack the case and help the Animal Agents find out what’s really been going on!\nAlison Thewliss MP said: “I hope parents, grandparents and carers in Glasgow will take their children to the library over the summer to sign up for the Tesco Bank Summer Reading Challenge Scotland. The challenge is free, inclusive and makes reading fun – a vital ingredient in building literacy.’\nSue Wilkinson, CEO of The Reading Agency said: “At The Reading Agency, we believe that everything changes when we read and we know from our research how much fun families and children have when taking part in the Challenge. This year we hope the wonderful characters created for us by Tony Ross will inspire more children than ever to take part and make use of their local library throughout the summer and beyond.”\nAdele Mills, Senior Community Investment Manager at Tesco Bank said: “Reading for pleasure is one of the best ways to spend the long summer holiday so we’re delighted that over 40,000 children from across the country will get involved in the Tesco Bank Summer Reading Challenge Scotland through their local library.

  "http_www_alisonthewliss_scot/https_www_alisonthewliss_scot_page_28/content_655.html": "Alison Thewliss, SNP MP for Glasgow Central, has criticised the UK Government for not transparently advertising tampon tax funding for women’s welfare groups.\nCurrent legislation means that VAT, at 5%, is added to essential women’s sanitary products. The SNP was the only party in 2015 general election campaign to pledge in its manifesto to abolish VAT on women’s sanitary products, also known as the ‘tampon tax’.\nAlison Thewliss first moved amendments to the UK Government’s budget in September, which sought to abolish the tax on ladies’ sanitary products. However, the Government asked for time to negotiate with the European Commission on EU VAT rules.\nIn November 2015, as part of the Autumn Statement, Chancellor George Osborne announced the establishment of a £15 million fund which would be open to bids for women’s welfare groups. The £15 million fund would return to women’s welfare groups the revenue generated from the tampon tax.\nOn 26th November, the day after the Autumn Statement, Thewliss wrote to the Chancellor and welcomed the establishment of the fund but asked how groups would be able to apply for the funding. It took the Government until 4th February 2016 to reply – some 76 days. Applications for the fund closed on 22 February 2016.\nThe Glasgow MP has now uncovered tracking changes on the UK Government’s website, which only informed groups how they could respond 16 days before applications closed – some 69 days after the Chancellor announced the establishment of the fund.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“The fact that it took the Chancellor almost 80 days to respond to a genuine enquiry from a Member of Parliament is shocking and shows gross disrespect to Parliament.\n“None the less, when I received information from the Treasury, I passed it on to women’s welfare groups and encouraged them to apply for the funding. I was gobsmacked last week when we found out that there was such a quick closing date for applications to the fund, despite it taking 69 days for the Government to bother publishing information as to how groups could actually apply. This is simply not good enough.\n“I’ve written to the Treasury demanding to know the exact chronology of events on this. Serious questions need to be asked, such as who was responsible for advertising this funding, what happened between 25 November and 2 February and whether the Government proactively advertised this fund to groups other than a small article hidden away on the gov.uk website\n“It is clear that a number of charities might well have lost out on this opportunity for funding, which is totally unfair. I am therefore calling upon the Government to urgently re-open the application process and properly raise awareness about the tampon tax fund.”",

The Home Secretary and the Church are working together to better scrutinise asylum claims based on religious persecution and ensure those in genuine need are supported, and that there are no loopholes to claiming asylum in this country.’\nIn the Home Affairs Committee today, Thewliss grilled the Minister about the lack of answer provided to the question put to the UK Government.\nDuring this discussion, the Minister highlighted that he couldn’t give a definitive answer on Ms Braverman’s claims, nor had he been presented with any such evidence.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“This is yet another deeply concerning moment for the integrity of politics in the UK.\n“Neither the Minister nor his officials could provide a shred of evidence today to support Ms Braverman’s wild claims. If she can’t provide any detail to back up her accusations, she must now apologise and retract her damaging comments.\n“Words have consequences; as The Reverend Steve Tinning pointed out to committee, the Baptist Church in Weymouth supporting asylum seekers from the Bibby Stockholm has received vile threats since these allegations were made in the press.\n“Places of Worship of all kinds support asylum seekers and refugees, welcoming them and helping them to integrate in our communities. They should be thanked, not criticised, by politicians.”",

The plan to restrict child tax credits to two children for new claimants is due to commence in 2017.\nSNP MP Alison Thewliss first identified the issue in July 2015 during the Government’s summer budget. She has now coordinated a cross party letter from MPs representing no less than nine parties in the House of Commons.\nIn addition to Alison Thewliss’ name, the letter is also signed by Andrew Percy, Conservative MP for Brigg and Goole; Jess Phillips, Labour MP for Birmingham Yardley; Liberal Democrat MP and former Deputy Leader of the House of Commons, Tom Brake, as well as MPs from the DUP, Green Party, UUP, Plaid Cymru and the SDLP.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“I am incredibly grateful to colleagues from across the House of Commons who have chosen to stand with us as part of the campaign to scrap the rape clause.\n“The fact that MPs from all the major parties in the House have put their differences aside to unite on this important issue should, in itself, send a powerful message to the Prime Minister that his Government must unequivocally scrap the rape clause.\n“I myself have already raised this issue on the floor of the House numerous times and Ministers’ responses to simple questions have been robotic at best and heartless at worst. We need to seriously ask ourselves, do we really want to be a country that summons raped women to Government offices and tell them to ‘prove it’ in order to get tax credits? Is that really how twenty-first century Britain wants to be behave?\n“I am sure that, deep down, David Cameron also doesn’t want us to continue down this precarious road to stigmatisation. The Prime Minister must therefore show leadership and today unequivocally drop plans for a rape clause on tax credits”.",
  "http_www_alisonthewliss_scot/http_www_alisonthewliss_scot_snp-mp-urges-uk-government-to-reverse-esol-funding-cuts/content_682.html": "Alison Thewliss, MP for Glasgow Central, has called on the UK Government to reverse damaging funding cuts to English language courses for refugees and asylum seekers and give asylum seekers the opportunity to work whilst they wait for their claims to be heard by the Home Office.\nAccording to research from the charity Refugee Action, UK government funding for ESOL classes in England and Wales has shrunk by more than £110 million in six years, leaving many applicants waiting up to three years to begin their learning. Combined with restrictions which prevent asylum seekers from working whilst in the UK, many asylum seekers and refugees face an uphill struggle to integrate into their new communities.\nIn Scotland, additional funding of over £1.4 million has been provided for ESOL classes as part of the Scottish Government’s New Scots Refugee Integration Strategy, which has created over 10,000 English language learning opportunities for refugees and asylum seekers.\nCommenting, following a Westminster Hall debate on English language teaching for refugees, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“It is great to see the Scottish Government doing all it can to support refugees and asylum seekers integrate into Scottish society. The landmark New Scots refugee integration strategy, backed by £1.4 million of funding for ESOL classes, has improved the prospects of thousands of refugees across Scotland to access work and education opportunities.\n“There are a number of organisations in my wonderfully diverse constituency offering first class English language teaching classes, at various locations across Glasgow. One such organisation is Nan McKay Community Hall, who have been providing English language support for at least fourteen years now, and the service continues to be very much in demand. Many of those who have enrolled at Nan McKay Community Hall have become part of the life of the community; they go on trips together, enjoy cookery and art, these brand new Glaswegians from Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Poland, Greece, Sudan, and more besides.\n“Despite considerable efforts in Scotland to improve refugee integration, it remains deeply concerning that the UK Government continues to place undue restrictions on asylum seekers who wish to contribute to society whilst their claims are being processed by the Home Office. Even modest participation in the labour market by a quarter of all asylum seekers in the UK would save the UK Government money whilst boosting economic growth and improving social cohesion.\n“Supporting vulnerable refugees and asylum seekers is not just the right thing to do, it brings tangible economic benefits to society as a whole. The UK Government can start today by reversing the damaging cuts to ESOL and stop alienating refugees and asylum seekers from the communities that seek to welcome their contribution.”",

In addition, 3 million people have been displaced and 7 million Yemenis are on the brink of starvation.\nMs Thewliss’ speech focussed on the need for opening up access for humanitarian aid and food imports, which is being hampered by both parties to the conflict. She called on Ministers to secure the port of Hodeida, which has been bombarded by Saudi air strikes. On a practical level, she asked Ministers to help get cranes installed which would speed up the importing of much needed food.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“Yemen is in dire straits. Acute and severe malnutrition is resulting in innocent children dying needlessly. There have been a suspected 22,000 cholera cases in the last six months and, heartbreakingly, 63,000 children died in 2016 from preventable causes linked to malnutrition. This is a political decision; blockades by the Saudi-led coalition are preventing and delaying aid agencies from getting food into the region. Military action\n“The UK talks a good game when it comes to international aid for Yemen and it’s right to say that £85 million has been given in the last year. The UK Government is less keen to trumpet its revenue from Saudi Arms, with 143 licences granted at an eye watering value of £3.3bn. These arms are causing deaths, injuries and destruction of vital infrastructure in the port of Hodeida.\n“Yemen has been debated many times in Parliament. The time for talk is over – we need firm action now to help some of the most vulnerable people and children on the face of the planet who are seeking shelter every day from the British-made bombs being dropped on them by Saudi Arabia.\n“Without an immediate ceasefire and a political settlement, Yemen’s people will continue to be starved in a man-made and preventable famine.

The rule change now means child tax credits and universal credit claims are restricted to the first two children in a family.\nIn addition, the policy also requires tax credit claimants, whose third or subsequent child was conceived as a result of rape, to prove this to social workers and health professionals in order to qualify for an exemption – a move that has been categorically denounced by faith leaders, women’s welfare groups, trade unions and child poverty campaigners alike.\nAlison Thewliss MP – who first exposed the policy – said:\n“I welcome the work that the Child Poverty Action Group have done to put pressure on the UK Government, following the introduction of the callous and heartless two child policy earlier this year.\n“The sad truth is, independent analysis shows that in excess of 200,000 children will move into relative poverty as a result of the two child policy.

Through the campaign, Diabetes UK is making the following calls to government:\n- Mandatory front-of-pack traffic light labelling on all pre-packed foods and drinks sold in the UK,\n- Mandatory calorie labelling on menus in key high street restaurants, cafes and takeaways, with carb content available online or when you ask for it in store,\n- Ensure carbohydrates are labelled on the back of products, per portion and as prepared.\nClear food labelling is vital for millions of people living with diabetes, to help them manage their condition and reduce their risk of serious complications. In a 2017 survey of more than 9,000 people living with or affected by diabetes, almost three quarters of respondents (73%) said that if all companies used the same food labelling system it would help them to make healthier choices.\nClear food labelling also helps the wider public, with or without diabetes, make more informed decisions about what they eat and drink. Recent public polling carried out by ComRes on behalf of\nDiabetes UK revealed that 9 out of 10 people said traffic-light food labelling helps them make healthier decisions, while only three in ten people (29%) said they felt they had enough information about what’s in their food.\nIn addition, more than three quarters of people (76%) said that cafes, restaurants and takeaways should display calorie information on their menus, so that customers understand the content of the food and drink they buy.\nTraffic-light labelling assigns a red, amber or green value in relation to fat, saturated fat, sugar and salt, as well as giving information on the calories in a product, to help consumers find out what’s in the food and drink they’re buying. Evidence shows that both front-of-pack traffic light labelling and calorie labelling informs consumers and helps making the healthier choice the easier choice.\nHowever, clear and consistent food labelling is not currently compulsory. Companies don’t have to provide any information on the front of their goods, and one in three products in shops don’t have clear traffic-light labels. Many restaurants, cafes and takeaways also still do not provide calorie labelling on their menus or other nutritional information online or when asked for it in store.\nCommenting on the campaign, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“The public have made it clear that they support clearer labelling on food and drink to help them make healthier and better informed decisions about what they eat, so I’m happy to lend my support to Diabetes UK’s Food Upfront campaign.\n“Putting these simple measures into place could make a huge difference to the nation as a whole. Obesity and weight related chronic health conditions – including Type 2 diabetes – continue to rise, and it’s important that we do everything that we can to halt this growing health crisis.”\nHelen Dickens, Assistant Director of Campaigns and Mobilisation at Diabetes UK, said:\n“We know that consistent and clear food labelling can help all of us to make informed choices. For people with diabetes, easy access to clear and consistent labelling, for example on carbohydrate content, is vital to supporting them with their diabetes management.\n“With around two-thirds of adults, and almost a third of children in the UK classed as overweight or obese, and therefore at increased risk of Type 2 diabetes and other chronic health conditions, it’s really important that we have measures in place that help make it easier for all of us to know what’s in the food we’re buying.\n“That’s why we are calling for the government to strengthen and, when possible, introduce mandatory front of pack traffic-light labelling on packaging, and calorie labelling on menus. The British public overwhelmingly support these moves, so we are grateful to Alison Thewliss MP for her efforts in helping put these potentially life-changing measures into practice.”",

The training aims to raise awareness of the challenges people with Parkinson’s face.\nThe push for greater awareness is part of the charity’s activity to encourage people to Unite for Parkinson’s on World Parkinson’s Day, as a survey found that 32 per cent of people with Parkinson’s have been stared at in public and 11 per cent have been laughed at. In addition, 32 per cent of people do not feel that their symptoms are socially acceptable.\nParkinson’s affects 145,000 people in the UK, which is one in 350 people in Glasgow Central. With numbers of people affected expected to increase by a fifth by 2025, the charity is aiming to change attitudes about Parkinson’s to make life better for everyone living with the condition.\nThrough the training, Ms Thewliss’ office will learn more about the progressive neurological condition, the complex symptoms people face, as well as how to recognise and best support constituents with Parkinson’s.\nAlison Thewliss MP said:\n“It is shocking that people with Parkinson’s face so many barriers, including being mistaken for being drunk, when out in public.\n“My office staff and I want to take the training so that we are all better equipped to improve the lives of everyone affected by the condition in Glasgow Central and better understand the issues faced by those who come to my advice surgeries.”\nSteve Ford, Chief Executive of Parkinson’s UK, said:\n“We are thrilled that Alison Thewliss MP and their team have signed up to our Parkinson’s in the Workplace training.\n“Lack of public understanding can make simple things like getting the bus, going to work, or even heading out to the pub with friends daunting for people with Parkinson’s.\n“That’s why one small action like signing up to learn more about the condition can have a big impact on people with Parkinson’s. We look forward to seeing the difference Alison Thewliss’ support can make for their constituents in Glasgow Central.”\nAlison Thewliss MP is also backing a petition from Parkinson’s UK calling for more organisations to sign up for the training.

Today we got more heat than light from the Government.\n“Despite spending a significant proportion of my speech laying out concerns about the principle and operation of the two child policy and the rape clause, the Minister made no attempt whatsoever to address these issues.\n“The Minister failed to take on board well founded and legitimate concerns about the Government’s third party reporting mechanism, and couldn’t give any guarantees how this would work. That is shocking when you consider the policy was announced over 400 days ago.\n“The other red herring today was this same tired line that the Government will be consulting with stakeholders, but this has been incredibly limited in scope so far. Charities such as Stepchange Debt Charity, Child Poverty Action Group and Scottish Women’s Aid have all criticised the policy.\n“In light of the fact that the Government is clearly unwilling to meaningfully engage – and do so publicly – on this deeply worrying policy, I will now be pushing ahead to organise a major event at Westminster which will bring together women’s welfare groups, rape crisis charities, faith communities and welfare charities. I will, of course, be inviting the Minister to address the event and listen to the very genuine concerns which still exist and could have been resolved today”.",

Since then, she has:\n- Questioned former Prime Minister David Cameron in the House of Commons;\n- Coordinated a cross party letter from MPs representing no less than nine parties in the Commons – including the Conservatives – calling for the then Prime Minister, David Cameron, to drop his planned policy;\n- Launched the website www.scraptherapeclause.co.uk, which led to over 10,000 signatures on a petition, forcing the Government to respond to public opposition to the policy;\n- Questioned former Chancellor George Osborne in the House of Commons;\n- Met with Welfare Reform Minister, Lord Freud, to press him on key details of the policy which still, to this day, remain unanswered;\n- Prompted a response from the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child, who expressed grave concern about the planned tax credit cuts;\n- Questioned former Secretary of State for Work & Pensions Iain Duncan Smith in the Commons;\n- Published damning calls from PCS, one of the main civil servants unions in the UK, calling for the policy to be abolished.\nThis week, the campaigning MP has written to Downing Street, calling upon Theresa May to use the recent change in Government and forthcoming Autumn Statement to abolish the deeply flawed changes to tax credits.\nIn addition, Ms Thewliss was informed today (Tuesday) that she has been granted a Westminster debate, which she says she will use to “interrogate” Ministers on their proposed plans.\nCommenting, the Glasgow Central MP said:\n“Theresa May certainly wasn’t shy in weeding out many of the former Prime Minister’s allies in the cabinet, and she is obviously not afraid to do things differently from David Cameron.\n“Given that she’s had the courage to do this and to review some of the previous Government’s key policy commitments, I am today calling upon her to scrap a very real and serious policy which is still frightening vulnerable women and welfare charities all over the UK.\n“Since summer 2015, I’ve been pursuing the Government on their deeply flawed plans to restrict tax credit payments to two children per family.\n“Equally worrying is their medieval plan to introduce a rape clause, whereby certain exemptions will be made – and tax credits paid – if a women can prove her third child was conceived as a result of rape.\n“Earlier this year, I had an dreadful meeting with the Welfare Minister, Lord Freud, who struggled to answer basic questions and suggested that women in abusive relationships – where the majority of rapes still happen – should just flee. This showed the Minister to be completely ignorant of the very real dangers some women face.\n“I am pleased to have secured a parliamentary debate on this issue to interrogate the Government on their cruel and unworkable policy. Over a year on from announcing it, they still don’t know how it could be implemented.\n“A parliamentary debate, change in personnel in Government, as well as the forthcoming Autumn Statement, means that Theresa May has plenty of opportunities to do the right thing, stand up for vulnerable women and scrap the rape clause.\n“This needn’t be about saving face for the Prime Minister. It’s about this Prime Minister standing up for other women, doing the decent thing and getting shot of this wicked policy agenda”.",

This year the initiative follows on naturally from the inaugural First Minister’s Reading Challenge which runs during term time, helping to contribute to a continuation of children’s reading in the break from school.\nResearch shows that reading for pleasure is a more powerful factor in life achievement than socio-economic background, and that children who use libraries are twice as likely to be above average readers.\nThe Challenge is a unique partnership between The Reading Agency and public libraries across the UK which last year got over three quarters of a million children borrowing, reading and talking about their favourite books.\nThis year’s challenge theme is Animal Agents, based on a detective agency staffed by all kinds of clever animals – furry, scaly and slippery – who are out to crack a case with a little help from their friends. Tony Ross, the UK’s best-selling children’s illustrator (including creator of the Little Princess books, illustrator of the Horrid Henry series by Francesca Simon, and books by David Walliams and Claire Balding), has created this year’s exclusive artwork.\nTo take part, all children need to do is to head to their local library where they will be given a collector folder to keep a record of their reading journey. Children that read at least six library books over the summer, will collect stickers which will give them helpful clues to crack the case and help the Animal Agents find out what’s really been going on!\nAlison Thewliss MP said: “I hope parents, grandparents and carers in Glasgow will take their children to the library over the summer to sign up for the Tesco Bank Summer Reading Challenge Scotland. The challenge is free, inclusive and makes reading fun – a vital ingredient in building literacy.’\nSue Wilkinson, CEO of The Reading Agency said: “At The Reading Agency, we believe that everything changes when we read and we know from our research how much fun families and children have when taking part in the Challenge. This year we hope the wonderful characters created for us by Tony Ross will inspire more children than ever to take part and make use of their local library throughout the summer and beyond.”\nAdele Mills, Senior Community Investment Manager at Tesco Bank said: “Reading for pleasure is one of the best ways to spend the long summer holiday so we’re delighted that over 40,000 children from across the country will get involved in the Tesco Bank Summer Reading Challenge Scotland through their local library. The Challenge aims to inspire children to pick up and enjoy reading books – something that will undoubtedly have a positive effect on their future.”\nFor more information on the Summer Reading Challenge including how to get involved and resources for schools, go to www.readingagency.org.uk/summerreadingchallenge\nFollow the Summer Reading Challenge at www.facebook.com/SummerReadingChallengeUK and on Twitter @readingagency #summerreadingchallenge",

Now the MP is asking interested parties to submit thoughts and proposals for consideration before 9am on Monday 9th January 2017. After that she will move to drafting the Bill, which will be published early in the new year.\nThe Bill seeks to make provision for the control of advertising and promotion of feeding products for babies and children. The MP intends for the Bill to establish a body – completely independent of industry – which would regularly safety test formula milks and other infant feeding products, and potentially adjudicate on the veracity of claims made by companies as to the ingredients and nutritional value of such products. The Bill aims also to include provision for stiffer financial penalties for formula companies which publish scientifically inaccurate and misleading claims.\nThose interested in responding to the consultation are asked to fill out a short consultation form.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“I have been overwhelmed by the support and good wishes of so many people who have a wealth of knowledge around infant feeding. I would encourage as many people as possible to visit my website, fill out the consultation form, and let me know their thoughts as to what might potentially be helpful to include in the Bill.\n“Taking a Ten Minute Rule Bill all the way through to being put on the statute books is a tall order, so I am keen to give the Bill the best possible chance of success.

Over three million people have been displaced and 10,000 people have been killed during the civil war.\n“Yemen day was a valuable opportunity for a range of interested parties to come together and take stock of the current situation in Yemen. It was an incredibly sobering experience to reflect on the fact that 12 million Yemenis lack sufficient food and over 460,000 children under the age of five are at serious risk of malnutrition. 4.5 million people in Yemen urgently require emergency shelter.\n“This week, the Disasters Emergency Committee launched an urgent appeal and I would encourage as many people as possible to donate to that vital fundraising drive. As important as aid is, we also need significant diplomatic intervention so that agencies can deliver life saving services.\n“Wednesday’s revelation that the United States is suspending some of its Saudi arms sales is a small but welcome step forward. It is now incumbent upon the United Kingdom Government to immediately follow suit and suspend the sale of the UK-produced bombs which have been bombarding Yemen.

A rescue operation is underway following a Russian missile strike. There are people under the rubble. As of now, 20 people are reported to have been injured and ten killed. My condolences to their close ones.\n“Unfortunately, the death toll may still rise.

It is an inherently risky journey for people who are already vulnerable and desperate.\nHowever, there is no evidence to suggest that this Bill will have any impact on the number of dangerous crossings, or that a restrictive asylum policy in general acts as a deterrent. It is clear that the Home Office is aware of the limitations of these kinds of policies. In 2022, the Rwanda scheme lacked evidence to the point where the Civil Service was unable to confirm its value for public money.\nIt is extremely worrying to see the UK Government press ahead with policies which pose a serious and consistent threat to our international human rights obligations. It is worse still when these policies show no promise of delivering their intended consequences. This Bill will not make people safe – it will put victims of trafficking and modern slavery even more at risk, and leave refugees fleeing persecution in limbo, or offshored thousands of miles away.\nParliamentarians in both Scotland and the UK are human rights guarantors, and an important part of our role is to ensure that legislation is compliant with international obligations on human rights. The incompatibility of the Bill with the European Convention on Human Rights, the Refugee Convention, The Convention of Action Against Trafficking, and the Convention on the Rights of the Child means that we as lawmakers are obliged to vote against it.\nThe undermining of rights conveyed upon individuals by these agreements must be resisted by all spheres of government. This Bill will negatively impact directly on those seeking international protection in Scotland, as well as on the powers and duties of the Scottish Government, local authorities, and other public bodies under the devolution settlement. We call upon MSPs to withhold legislative consent when this legislation is put before the Scottish Parliament.\nArbitrary detention of refugee and asylum-seeking children and their families, trafficking victims, victims of torture and other vulnerable people is entirely unacceptable. You may recall that Scotland led the way in campaigning against child detention. In May 2010, Dungavel was closed to children, with detention centres elsewhere in the UK rapidly following suit. It is unthinkable that we now face a situation where these rights are being rolled back.\nScotland’s refugee and asylum-seeking community deserves better. The Home Office have shown time and time again that they cannot be trusted when it comes to looking after vulnerable children and adults.\nWe urge all Scottish parliamentarians to take a principled stand against this pernicious legislation.\nYours sincerely,\nAlan Brown MP\nAlison Thewliss MP\nAlasdair Allan MSP\nAllan Dorans MP\nAlyn Smith MP\nAmy Callaghan MP\nAngela Crawley MP\nAngus Brendan MacNeil MP\nAnne McLaughlin MP\nBill Kidd MSP\nBob Doris MSP\nBrendan O’Hara MP\nCarol Monaghan MP\nChris Law MP\nChris Stephens MP\nClare Adamson MSP\nColin Beattie MSP\nCollette Stevenson MSP\nDave Doogan MP\nDavid Linden MP\nDeidre Brock MP\nDouglas Chapman MP\nDr Lisa Cameron MP\nDr Philippa Whitford MP\nDrew Hendry MP\nEmma Roddick MSP\nEvelyn Tweed MSP\nFiona Hyslop MSP\nGavin Newlands MP\nGordon Macdonald MSP\nGraeme Dey MSP\nHannah Bardell MP\nJames Dornan MSP\nJenni Minto MSP\nJoanna Cherry KC MP\nJohn Mason MSP\nJohn McNally MP\nJohn Nicolson MP\nKaukab Stewart MSP\nKenny MacAskill MP\nKirsten Oswald MP\nKirsty Blackman MP\nMarie McNair MSP\nMarion Fellows MP\nMartin Docherty-Hughes MP\nMartyn Day MP\nMhairi Black MP\nMs Anum Qaisar MP\nOwen Thompson MP\nPatrick Grady MP\nPatricia Gibson MP\nPaul McLennan MSP\nPete Wishart MP\nPeter Grant MP\nRichard Thomson MP\nRona Mackay MSP\nRonnie Cowan MP\nRt Hon Ian Blackford MP\nRt Hon Stewart Hosie MP\nRuth Maguire MSP\nSiobhan Brown MSP\nStephanie Callaghan MSP\nStephen Flynn MP\nSteven Bonnar MP\nStewart Malcolm McDonald MP\nStuart McDonald MP\nStuart McMillan MSP\nTommy Sheppard MP",

The decision was met with widespread, cross-party condemnation, with many MPs commenting that closures would place an additional burden on those already struggling to make ends meet.\nIn a passionate plea during Prime Minister’s Questions, the SNP MP noted that a constituent of hers who is 58, has a variety of serious health concerns, and was only recently discharged from hospital, attended Bridgeton JobCentre on Tuesday, only to find it was closed. Ms Thewliss asked the Prime Minister to apologise to her constituent for not having made her aware of the JobCentre’s closure, and to refund her taxi fare.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“This situation really is absurd. Not only are my constituents who previously used Bridgeton JobCentre expected to travel to alternative locations to attend mandatory appointments, it appears that the government hasn’t even told them that their local JobCentre has closed.\n“Unfortunately, whilst shocking, the case I raised during PMQs will not be unique. People will be turning up to JobCentres across Glasgow to find out for the first time that their local service no longer exists.\n“The DWP holds extensive details of every claimant: they should take responsibility for their actions and write to everyone on their database to inform them about the closures.\n“Surely the government must see what a shambles this whole process has been.

Talking Buses, which provide audio-visual “next stop” and “final destination” announcements, are essential for people with sight loss to live independently. Worryingly, only one fifth of the UK’s buses are talking buses, 97% of which are in London. For a sighted person, missing a stop is an annoyance, but for someone with sight loss, it is potentially dangerous.\nThe MP for Glasgow Central supports Guide Dogs’ proposal to make buses accessible for everyone. Earlier this year the SNP called on the UK Government to make sure all new buses are talking buses, calling it a “life-changing” move. As a result of Guide Dogs’ campaign, the UK government has acted to include this proposal into the Bus Services Bill.\nAlison Thewliss MP commented:\n“I was shocked to learn when speaking with the charity Guide Dogs how often blind people miss their stop because they do not know where they are. The Bus Services Bill is the biggest reform of buses since the 1980s so it is a unique opportunity to make sure that blind people can use buses safely too. I’m delighted that the UK government has listened and included talking buses in the bill”\nJames White, Senior Campaigns Manager at Guide Dogs, commented:\n“Talking buses give independence to people with sight loss, enabling them to travel on their own and reducing stress and anxiety. They also help other travellers including tourists and infrequent bus users to reach their destination safely.\n“The UK government have now recognised the need to roll out talking buses nationwide. We are asking politicians like Alison Thewliss to ensure they follow through and commit to making talking buses the norm across the UK.”",

This was demonstrated recently when the Government’s obesity strategy didn’t even reference infant feeding, despite it being a factor in future health.\n“The UK has the lowest breastfeeding rates in the world, even though we know more mums would wish to breastfeed; there’s clearly an issue which needs to be addressed. In addition, feedback on my recent Formula Marketing Bill suggests there’s a real lack of impartial information and support available for those bottle feeding and I would welcome views on this.\n“With ever increasing cuts to budgets, it’s been suggested that peer support funding for breastfeeding has been disproportionately slashed, so we’re also keen to look into this more and identify the gaps in service provision. Equally, though, there are a number of groups out there – albeit under pressure – doing some really innovative things to try and support families and babies.\n“In taking this inquiry out of Westminster and holding evidence sessions around the UK, I am very much looking forward to hearing people’s views and collating them into a substantive report for the Government to implement.”\nThe deadline for written submissions to the inquiry is 9am on Monday 12th June 2017.

To watch the UK Government revel in a clear breach of human rights is wicked and shameful.\n“While I do not have any knowledge or information on who may detained or removed, or how these decisions will be made, it is important that my constituents know their rights.\n“If you have received any letters from the Home Office which mention Rwanda, please make sure that you contact your lawyer immediately.\n“If you are asked to attend an immigration appointment, please make sure a friend or relative knows where and when you are going and can call your lawyer if they do not hear from you after 2 hours.\n“If you don’t have someone to do this, the No Evictions Network can also provide someone. If there is an emergency or you have been detained, please also contact No Evictions Emergency Hotline (07438318003) or email noevictionsnetwork@gmail.com.\n“Please do not hesitate to get in touch with my office if you are a constituent affected during this difficult time.”",

It is an inherently risky journey for people who are already vulnerable and desperate.\nHowever, there is no evidence to suggest that this Bill will have any impact on the number of dangerous crossings, or that a restrictive asylum policy in general acts as a deterrent. It is clear that the Home Office is aware of the limitations of these kinds of policies. In 2022, the Rwanda scheme lacked evidence to the point where the Civil Service was unable to confirm its value for public money.\nIt is extremely worrying to see the UK Government press ahead with policies which pose a serious and consistent threat to our international human rights obligations. It is worse still when these policies show no promise of delivering their intended consequences. This Bill will not make people safe – it will put victims of trafficking and modern slavery even more at risk, and leave refugees fleeing persecution in limbo, or offshored thousands of miles away.\nParliamentarians in both Scotland and the UK are human rights guarantors, and an important part of our role is to ensure that legislation is compliant with international obligations on human rights. The incompatibility of the Bill with the European Convention on Human Rights, the Refugee Convention, The Convention of Action Against Trafficking, and the Convention on the Rights of the Child means that we as lawmakers are obliged to vote against it.\nThe undermining of rights conveyed upon individuals by these agreements must be resisted by all spheres of government. This Bill will negatively impact directly on those seeking international protection in Scotland, as well as on the powers and duties of the Scottish Government, local authorities, and other public bodies under the devolution settlement. We call upon MSPs to withhold legislative consent when this legislation is put before the Scottish Parliament.\nArbitrary detention of refugee and asylum-seeking children and their families, trafficking victims, victims of torture and other vulnerable people is entirely unacceptable. You may recall that Scotland led the way in campaigning against child detention. In May 2010, Dungavel was closed to children, with detention centres elsewhere in the UK rapidly following suit. It is unthinkable that we now face a situation where these rights are being rolled back.\nScotland’s refugee and asylum-seeking community deserves better. The Home Office have shown time and time again that they cannot be trusted when it comes to looking after vulnerable children and adults.\nWe urge all Scottish parliamentarians to take a principled stand against this pernicious legislation.\nYours sincerely,\nAlan Brown MP\nAlison Thewliss MP\nAlasdair Allan MSP\nAllan Dorans MP\nAlyn Smith MP\nAmy Callaghan MP\nAngela Crawley MP\nAngus Brendan MacNeil MP\nAnne McLaughlin MP\nBill Kidd MSP\nBob Doris MSP\nBrendan O’Hara MP\nCarol Monaghan MP\nChris Law MP\nChris Stephens MP\nClare Adamson MSP\nColin Beattie MSP\nCollette Stevenson MSP\nDave Doogan MP\nDavid Linden MP\nDeidre Brock MP\nDouglas Chapman MP\nDr Lisa Cameron MP\nDr Philippa Whitford MP\nDrew Hendry MP\nEmma Roddick MSP\nEvelyn Tweed MSP\nFiona Hyslop MSP\nGavin Newlands MP\nGordon Macdonald MSP\nGraeme Dey MSP\nHannah Bardell MP\nJames Dornan MSP\nJenni Minto MSP\nJoanna Cherry KC MP\nJohn Mason MSP\nJohn McNally MP\nJohn Nicolson MP\nKaukab Stewart MSP\nKenny MacAskill MP\nKirsten Oswald MP\nKirsty Blackman MP\nMarie McNair MSP\nMarion Fellows MP\nMartin Docherty-Hughes MP\nMartyn Day MP\nMhairi Black MP\nMs Anum Qaisar MP\nOwen Thompson MP\nPatrick Grady MP\nPatricia Gibson MP\nPaul McLennan MSP\nPete Wishart MP\nPeter Grant MP\nRichard Thomson MP\nRona Mackay MSP\nRonnie Cowan MP\nRt Hon Ian Blackford MP\nRt Hon Stewart Hosie MP\nRuth Maguire MSP\nSiobhan Brown MSP\nStephanie Callaghan MSP\nStephen Flynn MP\nSteven Bonnar MP\nStewart Malcolm McDonald MP\nStuart McDonald MP\nStuart McMillan MSP\nTommy Sheppard MP",

She has hailed CCG’s house building techniques as being revolutionary and a model which others should look to.\nCCG has a well-developed model of building timber properties within its Glasgow factory.

CCG have worked hard to make house building more efficient, dramatically reducing the time taken to construct new homes.\n“CCG is a remarkable firm based in Glasgow with over 600 employees and a turnover of £120 million per year. I was particularly impressed with the strong emphasis they’ve put on training and apprenticeships, which will go some way to dealing with some of the skills shortages within the construction industry.\n“As the CLG committee continues to look at capacity in the housebuilding industry, I am very hopeful that we’ll be able to take a closer look at the impressive work CCG is doing in Scotland.”",

The MPs were putting their case for lifting the ban on asylum seekers to work.\nDespite a number of attempts from MPs to intervene on the Minister, Sarah Newton, they were told that there was not enough time to take interventions or questions. The Minister then closed the debate early without addressing many of the points raised by MPs.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“Today I outlined the societal and economic benefits of lifting the ban on asylum seekers working. Valid points were raised by Conservative, Labour and SNP MPs, all of which were ducked by the Minister.\n“I am not sure whether the Minister responding didn’t know her brief or if she was genuinely trying to shut down legitimate questions about the fallacy of the current policy.\n“Frustratingly, the Government merely repeated the usual right wing rhetoric we’re so used to hearing when it comes to asylum and immigration policy.\n“Despite a contemptable performance from the Minister today, the SNP won’t be letting go of this issue. The case for lifting the ban on asylum seekers working is both morally and economically justified. Had the Minister allowed the debate to run for the full allotted time today, she might have started to understand that”.\nI couldn’t agree more Alison. Could it be that there are vested interests here in NOT doing anything that enables asylum seekers to demonstrate the undoubted skills, talent and expertise that very many of them possess? Let’s face it, that wouldn’t sit well alongside the attitude that the current government seems to embrace. Heaven forbid that certain sections of the British people start to see asylum seekers as able to contribute earlier to economic development and that they could so easily be able to be financially independent of state aid.",
  "http_www_alisonthewliss_scot/https_www_alisonthewliss_scot_campaigning-mp-welcomes-lords-condemnation-of-rape-clause/content_91.html": "Campaigning MP, Alison Thewliss, has today welcomed the publication of a House of Lords’ Delegated Legislation Committee report which raises serious concerns about the UK Government’s two child policy and rape clause.\nThe Committee has called for the Regulations, which are due to be enacted in under a week, to be examined again by the House of Commons. According to the report, the Committee have “cast doubt as to whether the system will be fully set up by 6 April, when the legislation takes effect, and on whether the exception relating to non-consensual conception can ever be made to work.”\nMembers of the Committee have also rounded on the DWP’s inadequate provision of training for the rape clause third party reporting mechanism, saying that the DWP “takes no account of the training that may be necessary for the assessors eventually chosen.”\nThis shocking criticism highlights the poor preparations that Tory Ministers have put in place for the policy, with no training offered for the hundreds of thousands of nurses, doctors and social workers who will be expected to judge whether or not a woman’s child has been conceived as a result of rape.\nCommenting on the report, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“With just days left until the two child policy and rape clause comes into force, the House of Lords’ Delegated Legislation Committee have highlighted a raft of serious flaws that are embedded within this pernicious and medieval policy.\n“The cruelty of expecting benefit claimants to have to re-live the ordeal of a rape in order to access their benefits to help pay the bills and feed their family is undeniable. This report could not be any clearer – Tory Ministers’ plans for the two child policy and rape clause will not work, forcing vulnerable women to relive the ordeal of rape just to claim a benefit.\n“With time ticking away, Ministers must now wake up to the warnings that the two child policy and rape clause are ill-thought-out and that they will cause unbearable hardship to families. It’s not too late for the UK Government to change tack and ditch this unworkable and medieval policy and I urge Ministers to do so now.”",

Solicitors representing those with pleural plaques and asbestosis have said that some requests for employment history schedules to be released are taking up to 14 months.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“When my constituent first contacted me about this, he had already been waiting a year for HMRC to release his employment history. Quite simply, his compensation claim couldn’t progress without this. Unfortunately, it took a letter from me to the Chancellor to get this information finally released, which really shouldn’t be necessary.\n“Figures uncovered using parliamentary questions would suggest that tens of thousands of other people are still waiting for HMRC to get a move on and issue these vital documents. This simply isn’t good enough and the Government must act without delay.”\nThe two MPs have launched an online survey, calling upon those whose claims are still pending to come forward and share their experience. They are also writing to charities and working men’s clubs all across the UK to raise awareness of the campaign.\nIn addition, they have sought a meeting with Treasury Ministers who are responsible for overseeing the department working to progress requests for employment schedules.\nAnne McLaughlin MP, who raised a similar case with the Justice Secretary in the Commons last week, also commented:\n“It is increasingly clear that, for whatever reason, people are being stonewalled by HMRC inefficiency, which means that compensation claims- some of which are time barred – cannot be progressed without an employment history schedule.\n“We have written to Treasury Ministers, asking for an urgent meeting to discuss this backlog.\n“It beggars belief that the Government could set-up the white elephant that was Concentrix to go and proactively hassle folk over tax credits – often needlessly – yet we find out there are tens of thousands of people being held back from getting compensation because another Government department can’t get a move on.\n“I would urge as many people as forward to come forward, take part in our survey and join us in demanding that HMRC gets a move on and allows these people to get on with their lives.”",

  "http_www_alisonthewliss_scot/https_www_alisonthewliss_scot_snp-mp-urges-uk-government-to-reverse-esol-funding-cuts/content_637.html": "Alison Thewliss, MP for Glasgow Central, has called on the UK Government to reverse damaging funding cuts to English language courses for refugees and asylum seekers and give asylum seekers the opportunity to work whilst they wait for their claims to be heard by the Home Office.\nAccording to research from the charity Refugee Action, UK government funding for ESOL classes in England and Wales has shrunk by more than £110 million in six years, leaving many applicants waiting up to three years to begin their learning. Combined with restrictions which prevent asylum seekers from working whilst in the UK, many asylum seekers and refugees face an uphill struggle to integrate into their new communities.\nIn Scotland, additional funding of over £1.4 million has been provided for ESOL classes as part of the Scottish Government’s New Scots Refugee Integration Strategy, which has created over 10,000 English language learning opportunities for refugees and asylum seekers.\nCommenting, following a Westminster Hall debate on English language teaching for refugees, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“It is great to see the Scottish Government doing all it can to support refugees and asylum seekers integrate into Scottish society. The landmark New Scots refugee integration strategy, backed by £1.4 million of funding for ESOL classes, has improved the prospects of thousands of refugees across Scotland to access work and education opportunities.\n“There are a number of organisations in my wonderfully diverse constituency offering first class English language teaching classes, at various locations across Glasgow. One such organisation is Nan McKay Community Hall, who have been providing English language support for at least fourteen years now, and the service continues to be very much in demand. Many of those who have enrolled at Nan McKay Community Hall have become part of the life of the community; they go on trips together, enjoy cookery and art, these brand new Glaswegians from Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Poland, Greece, Sudan, and more besides.\n“Despite considerable efforts in Scotland to improve refugee integration, it remains deeply concerning that the UK Government continues to place undue restrictions on asylum seekers who wish to contribute to society whilst their claims are being processed by the Home Office. Even modest participation in the labour market by a quarter of all asylum seekers in the UK would save the UK Government money whilst boosting economic growth and improving social cohesion.\n“Supporting vulnerable refugees and asylum seekers is not just the right thing to do, it brings tangible economic benefits to society as a whole. The UK Government can start today by reversing the damaging cuts to ESOL and stop alienating refugees and asylum seekers from the communities that seek to welcome their contribution.”",
  "http_www_alisonthewliss_scot/https_www_alisonthewliss_scot_too-much-information-campaign/content_481.html": "On Monday 11 April Alison Thewliss, MP for Glasgow Central, was one of nearly 100 MPs who attended an event organised by The National Autistic Society who recently launched their Too Much Information campaign. Ms Thewliss is backing the charity’s new campaign to improve public understanding of autism.\nAs part of the campaign, the charity has released a report (Too Much Information: why the public needs to understand autism better) which revealed how poor public understanding of autism is pushing autistic people and their families into isolation.\nAccording to a survey of over 7,000 autistic people, their families and friends, and professionals:\n• 87% of families say people stare and 74% say people tut or make disapproving noises about behaviour associated with their child’s autism\n• 84% of autistic people say people judge them as strange\n• 79% of autistic people and 70% of family members feel socially isolated\n• 50% of both autistic people and family members sometimes or often don’t go out because they’re worried about how people will react to their autism\nThis is why the National Autistic Society is calling on the public to find out more about autism so they can respond to autistic people with more understanding.\nMore than 1 in 100 people are on the autism spectrum. This means that someone sees, hears and feels the world in a different, often more intense, way to other people. Autistic people often find social situations difficult and struggle to filter out the sounds, smells, sights and information they experience, which means they feel overwhelmed by ‘too much information’ when out in public.\nIn 2015, a YouGov poll found that over 99.5% of the people in the UK had heard of autism. However, just 16% of autistic people and their families said that the public had a meaningful understanding of autism. This means that while lots of people have heard of the word autism, very few actually understand what it means to be autistic.\nThe charity has also released a short film, shot from the point of view of a child on the autism spectrum experiencing ‘too much information’ as he walks through a shopping centre. It shows how painful and overwhelming it is for the boy – and how much more difficult it is when people make nasty remarks or throw judgmental glares at him and his mother. The film concludes with the words: ‘I’m not naughty: I’m autistic’.\nThe Marshall family, whose son Alex plays the little boy in the campaign film, also attended the event in Parliament on Monday. Alex is a ten-year-old autistic boy, and he and his parents share the National Autistic Society’s passion to improve public understanding of autism.\nAlex’s mum and dad, Ben and Kathryn Marshall, said: “When Alex was filming, we were watching him from the balcony and there was a woman who gave this look, a little glance. Everybody watching with us said, ‘That’s the look!’ We all knew it. It was that split second of contempt which says, ‘why can’t you control your child?’\n“That’s why we’re so thrilled to be involved in the Too Much Information campaign and get the chance to help people realise how big a difference they can make to families like ours, by simply showing a little understanding rather than throwing us a judgmental look.”\nAlison Thewliss said: “The National Autistic Society’s important report shows why we must work harder to improve public understanding of autism. No-one should ever feel so misunderstood that they sometimes can’t leave their home.\n“That’s why I’m pleased to support the Too Much Information campaign and am encouraging my constituents to learn a little bit more about autism.\n“A basic understanding of autism could help open up the world for autistic people and their families in our community and across the UK.”",

Accordingly, the UN’s Committee on the Rights of the Child will be launching an investigation next week.\nMs Thewliss welcomed the UN’s intervention and said:\n“Everyone knows that the medieval two child policy and rape clause is unworkable, immoral and is now almost certainly in contravention of the UN Convention of the Rights of the Child, which the UK signed up to almost twenty five years ago.\n“I warmly welcome the UN’s decision to intervene and shine a very bright light onto this cruel and thoughtless Government, which appears hell bent on making life as difficult as possible for ordinary people.\n“It is clear that, over the last ten months, the Tories had hoped this campaign would be quietly dropped but the fact it has caught the attention of the UN suggests this policy is now totally untenable.

The #BenefitsAware campaign, launched by national charity Turn2us, aims to raise awareness of unclaimed support that those in financial hardship may be unaware of.\nNew research by the charity found that half (50%) of low income households in Scotland are not claiming the welfare benefits and tax credits they could be entitled to. This is despite the fact that a huge 86% of this group have seen no improvement to their financial situation over the last year.\nNearly three-fifths (58%) of those in Scotland who aren’t receiving this support said they had been deterred from checking or claiming potential benefits entitlements because they did not think they would be eligible. In addition, over one in ten (11%) said they were unsure of how or where to find out about this help. As a result, over three-quarters (77%) have not checked what welfare benefits they could be entitled to within the last year.\nFurthermore, over two-thirds (67%) would not consider checking their benefits entitlements if their income dropped, and only 2% would turn to a charity for help. Yet nearly two-fifths (37%) said they would cut back on gas, electricity and other essentials, and over a quarter (28%) would resort to cutting back on food.\nMs Thewliss pledged her support for the campaign at a special event in parliament this week, commenting:\n“Anyone can find themselves struggling financially and it’s really important that those needing help know where to turn. The benefits system can be a bit daunting, especially if you’ve never claimed before, which is why the Turn2us #BenefitsAware campaign is so important.\n“Over £15bn in welfare benefits went unclaimed last year with £2.8bn in Pension Credit not being taken up. It is nothing short of a tragedy that many of those who are entitled to that support are cutting back on essentials such and food or electricity, or turning to unscrupulous lenders.”\nTurn2us is urging anyone in need to use its free and confidential Benefits Calculator at Turn2us.org.uk to see what they could be entitled to and how to make a claim. The website also features information on benefits and other help for a range of different circumstances.\nSimon Hopkins, Chief Executive of Turn2us said:\n“Through our campaign, we want to show that financial hardship can happen for many different reasons and could affect anyone at any time in their lives. Welfare benefits exist to provide a vital source of support for people in need, including those who are in-work. We would urge anyone struggling to visit our website today to check what support could be available.”\nFor more information about the campaign, please visit Turn2us.org.uk/BenefitsAware.",

This plan should be dropped immediately.\n“What these parliamentary answers show is that Ministers are totally clueless on their own plans. They don’t appear to know how many claimants receive which benefit, therefore it begs the question – what rationale is there for removing this lifeline service?\n“Even more insulting is that Ministers devised the plan from their ivory towers in Whitehall to axe our local job centres without even bothering to visit.\n“Bridgeton and the wider area is not without its challenges. We already have a great network of local organisations and services to support people including Clyde Gateway, Citizens Advice Bureau, the Credit Union, Post Office, Olympia and Glasgow Women’s Library. Bridgeton job centre is a significant piece in this jigsaw.\n“Axing Bridgeton Jobcentre would be a serious blow to local people who would be expected to take numerous buses or walk for almost an hour to their next available Jobcentre.\n“Of course, had the UK Government Ministers bothered to do their homework, they’d have known this. Now they do – and now they should halt these plans without delay.”\nSNP Councillor for Calton ward, Greg Hepburn, added:\n“The closure of this Job Centre is a damaging decision that will have a huge impact on the lives of many people in the east end. Expecting local claimants to walk for up to an hour, take an expensive and unreliable bus or to own a car is at best careless and at worst negligent.”",

Rather than receiving the £200 payment, he only received half, which was eventually rectified following his MP’s intervention.\nThe Glasgow Central MP has written to Work & Pensions Secretary, Iain Duncan Smith, to ask for a full investigation into the system.\nAlison Thewliss, MP for Glasgow Central, said:\n“My constituent’s case highlights a serious anomaly within the UK Government’s winter fuel payment scheme, whereby potentially thousands of pensioners are being underpaid their winter fuel payments. All of this is because the Government’s system doesn’t always recognise buildings with multiple flats. I’ve written to Iain Duncan Smith to ask for a full investigation into this issue and to specifically ask for an urgent review of the payment system which seems to discriminate against buildings with more than one residence.\n“My own research shows that Glasgow alone has over 220,000 properties which comprise of flats, tenements and tower blocks. In my own constituency, over 45,000 properties are part of multi-dwelling properties. Now, of course, not all of those properties will be entitled to winter fuel payments but it does give you an idea of the scale of this problem in a city which is, after all, renowned for its red sandstone tenements.\n“Figures from Age UK show that an eye watering £3.7 billion in benefits already goes unclaimed by elderly people in the UK and I’m concerned that this is another example of older people not getting what they’re due.\n“As temperatures continue to plummet this January, we simply cannot continue on with the perverse scenario, whereby pensioners living in flats are possibly being undercut because of an anomaly in the DWP’s payment system.”\nRead with interest the winter fuel payments problems which affect pensioners who DWP hold incorrect details for In my case DWP started to correspond with me at my previous address when I became of state pension age despite having paid previous years payments correctly at my current address in November 2013/14/15 after being informed by letter when payment would be made\nMy main concern was that once they were made aware of the underpayment I was advised that no clerical action to pay the balance would even begin until at least Jan 2017\nAt the lifestyle and budgeting level this is more than inconvenient as the energy companies won’t want to hear of the circumstances that may put my account in arrears so like many people the heating will be have to be used sparingly………….\nMy comments are not for any action on my behalf but just to increase your knowledge bank……..\nI will get through… but wonder how others cope with a system that can make simple errors that have this level of consequence……\nHappy New year…..to you and yours\nUpdate as at 18/01/2017\nBy Clive\nAfter telephone contact with DWP no one is able to tell me a time scale for the payment to address my underpayment…..They confirm that they are now using the correct details and a payment will be made but will only say it will be before the end of March 2017!!!!!!!\nComment: As usual “Their error” but I suffer………\nExpedite sooner rather than later seem a concept that their system is incapable of……\nI don’t want special treatment I just want to be a bit warmer in winter rather than Spring time.\nAnother year same problem Despite checking and being assured verbally that my details that qualify me for this years winter were correct The DWP managed for the second year in a row to under pay me and actually paid funds into my bank account two weeks before I received a letter informing me of the payment at a previous address which is not my qualifing address. Last years underpayment took three and a half months to sort out, so enough is enough as their system cannot seem to cope to deliver a outcome that is expected by any right minded person in a timely manner I plan to raise a simple cause action and have a sherriff decide to impose a court order to recover the monies owed to me as a debt. I am loath to proceed in this manner but feel that the DWP flawed systems should not disadvantage anyone\nI will report my progress….",

Third party professionals, such as doctors, midwives, social workers and support workers, could potentially face a prison sentence of up to 10 years if they fail to disclose that a woman has been raped when completing the rape clause form – even if doing so means that women are placed in further danger of violence and sexual assault from their abusive partners.\nSpeaking ahead of the rally, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“Since its introduction in April, the rape clause has caused untold harm and distress across the UK. The cruelty of forcing women to relive the worst ordeal of their life, just in order to make a claim for benefit, shows the morally repugnant depths to which the UK Government has plumbed.\n“As if this wasn’t bad enough, women in Northern Ireland face a very specific risk under existing laws, which requires crimes such as rape to be reported to the police by the third party referrer. Women in abusive relationships are therefore placed in an appalling situation where either they are forced into the criminal justice system or they will struggle to afford to pay bills and put food on the table.\n“The rape clause also puts professionals in Northern Ireland in an incredibly difficult position, as they face the prospect of their reputations and careers being destroyed if they do not report that a woman has been raped to the police. It’s no coincidence that a growing number of trade unions and women’s aid groups have refused to endorse the third party referral mechanism for claims made under the rape clause, given the risks it presents to their members.\n“The rape clause could criminalise incredibly vulnerable women and the professionals who would wish to support them in Northern Ireland. I’ll be asking all of Northern Ireland’s MPs to join me in demanding an end to the two child policy and rape clause and the misery and poverty it has created for families across the UK.”",

  "http_www_alisonthewliss_scot/https_www_alisonthewliss_scot_category_press-releases_page_12/content_631.html": "Alison Thewliss MP has backed a campaign calling for a fair tax deal for Malawi, a country with strong historic links with Glasgow Central.\nActionAid’s #MakeTaxFair campaign is pushing for reform of the 1955 UK-Malawi tax treaty, which makes it possible for UK companies operating in Malawi to dramatically reduce their tax bill. The call is part of a wider campaign to reform unfair tax treaties.\nScotland has had close links with Malawi, dating back to when Scottish explorer David Livingstone arrived in Malawi in the 1850s. Each year, more than 94,000 Scots are involved in organisations that link with Malawi, according to the Scotland Malawi Partnership, the national network which exists to coordinate, represent and support Scotland’s civic links with Malawi, and which is supporting ActionAid’s campaign.\nThe Scotland Malawi Partnership has a number of member organisations in Glasgow Central which have links with Malawi.\nMalawi is one of the poorest countries in the world, with GDP per person of just $255 per year. This is a country where 10.5 million people live in extreme poverty – surviving on less than US$1.90 a day. More tax revenue is desperately needed to improve public services and pay for more doctors and teachers. Malawi has one of the highest child mortality rates in the world with more than one in twenty children dying before the age of 5.\nUK companies are the third largest investor there, with investments worth a total of US$157 million in 2010. Yet the outdated and unfair tax treaty has tied the hands of the Malawian government. The treaty was signed in 1955, prior to Malawi’s independence, by the British Governor on behalf of the governments of the British colonies of Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland.\nThe treaty is so out-of-date that it does not cover the taxation of television related income. The treaty also makes it possible for British multinationals to easily move money out of Malawi untaxed using methods such as interest or management fee payments, dividends or royalties.\nMs Thewliss is supporting a joint campaign with Malawian and UK activists, calling on the Government to replace this treaty with one that is fairer, and that supports Malawi in its fight against poverty.\nSince the campaign launched, both the UK Government and the Government of Malawi issued statements in which they say they hope a treaty can be renegotiated soon. ActionAid and the Scotland Malawi Partnership welcome this progress, and will continue campaigning to ensure that any new treaty is fair and helps Malawi raise revenue to fight poverty.\nCommenting, Ms Thewliss said:\n“Corporate tax scandals show how angry the British public are that big business isn’t paying its fair share.\n“Scotland’s long and enduring relationship with Malawi stretches back over 150 years, and today many local people in [INSERT MP’s CONSTITUENCY] are actively engaged in building up social, cultural and economic ties. But the UK-Malawi tax treaty is not fit for the 21st century.\nThat’s why I’m calling on the UK government to agree a better deal with Malawi – one that ensures that UK companies pay their fair share in one of the world’s poorest countries.”\nCharlie Matthews, ActionAid UK’s Senior Advocacy Adviser, said:\n“Malawi is losing out due to an outdated and unfair treaty, which makes it possible for UK businesses operating there to dramatically reduce their tax bill. Women and girls living in poverty are the ones paying the price as public services like schools and hospitals are starved of funding.\n“ActionAid is working with the Scotland Malawi Partnership to call on the UK government to negotiate a new, fairer treaty, one that makes tax fair for the people of Malawi.”\nDavid Hope Jones of the Scotland-Malawi Partnership said:\n“Scotland is rightly proud of its many links with Malawi which date back more than 150 years to Dr David Livingstone.

Over a year later, and despite Parliament sitting for over 5 weeks since the election, the legislation has still not been enacted by Parliament.\nAt Business Questions, Ms Thewliss called on Government Ministers today to bring the VAT relief scheme into operation as soon as possible. A motion has also been tabled, signed by MPs from across the House of Commons with affected museums in their constituencies, to call on the UK Government to put the draft law on the statute book immediately.\nSpeaking after Business Questions, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“Museums and art galleries across Scotland and the UK have unique and specialist collections which enrich our culture and heritage. With incomes for culture and the arts facing swingeing cuts from the UK Government, the VAT relief scheme is increasingly important to allow museums to devote more resources to educating and informing the public.\n“The weakness of the UK Government is clear for all to see – not only have they had to ditch many planned Bills following the Prime Minister’s botched election gamble, it now transpires that they are unable to get simple, uncontroversial statutory instruments through Parliament quickly.\n“Museums and art galleries across the UK are suffering from the dithering at the heart of Theresa May’s weak and wobbly Government. The Government must act now to honour the applications made for VAT refunds and provide certainty for hard-pressed museums and art galleries across the UK.”",

The pain, fatigue and lack of mobility caused by arthritis affects every aspect of a person’s life, making everyday tasks such as making a cup of tea, travelling to work or getting out of bed extremely difficult.\nAs well as the personal impact, the cost to NHS Scotland for hip fractures alone exceeds £73 million per year, and these conditions are the cause of one in five working days lost in the UK.\nAlison Thewliss MP, pictured at Arthritis Research UK’s annual Parliamentary reception, has pledged to support Arthritis Research UK’s Prevent, Transform, Cure manifesto in Parliament as an Arthritis Champion, which calls for:\n- Making arthritis and musculoskeletal conditions a public health priority\n- Ensuring people have timely access to health and care services that enable them to improve their musculoskeletal health\n- Ensure people with arthritis and musculoskeletal conditions have fair and timely access to services that support them to be in work, including financial support\n- Protect the UK’s position as a global leader in science and sustain the benefits of the life-science sector to the economy\nSpeaking about becoming an Arthritis Champion, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“I’m proud to champion Arthritis Research UK’s policy calls to tackle the prevention, transformation and cure of arthritis.

Cervical screening provides the best protection against the disease so it is concerning to hear that so many women are not attending this potentially life-saving test when invited. We all have a role to play in increasing attendance and I would urge the Greater Glasgow and Clyde Health Board to take action to tackle the declining coverage, which could ultimately save lives.”\nRobert Music, Chief Executive of Jo’s Cervical Cancer Trust, said: “Thanks to the cervical screening and HPV vaccination programme, cervical cancer is a disease that can be prevented. We want to see it eradicated, however to get there we need to work together to increase uptake of cervical screening and HPV vaccination. If we do not do this, we will see more women diagnosed and more lives lost.”\nWomen aged 25-49 are invited for their screening every 3 years and women aged 50-64 are invited every five years. In the UK, over 3,200 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer every year and 890 will lose their lives.\nDuring January’s Cervical Cancer Prevention Week (22-28 January), Jo’s Cervical Cancer Trust, will be raising awareness of how women can reduce their risk of cervical cancer through attending regular cervical screening, being symptoms aware, knowing the risk factors and taking up the HPV vaccination if offered.",

Indeed, End Child Poverty have called for an immediate cessation of the freeze on social security benefits, which has been in effect since 2016.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“The UK Government’s record on the issue of child poverty is appalling. This is a government who scrapped statutory income-based child poverty targets; clearly demonstrating how low down the issue is on their list of priorities.\n“The benefit cap continues to squeeze those who rely most on support, and in Glasgow the statistics make for grim reading – there are 636 households, and over 1,936 children directly affected. Not only that, according to a report published by Sheffield Hallam University, support for claimants in Glasgow, as a result of post-2015 welfare reforms, is anticipated to fall by an average of £420 per year.\n“Moreover, the UK Government’s two child limit ensures that Child Tax Credit claims – including the child element of Universal Credit – are restricted to the first two children in a family. This is tantamount to social engineering, and will mean a loss of up to £2,800 every year per child for countless families. This cut is so severe that the Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG) have estimated that it will plunge a further 200,000 children into poverty.\n“The Scottish Government is doing what it can to stem the flow of Tory cuts; already it has mitigated the devastating effects of the Bedroom Tax through discretionary housing payments, and moved to ensure that a reduction in Council Tax Support was not passed on to claimants in Scotland. It is unsustainable however to expect the Scottish taxpayer to continue to bear the financial brunt of Tory malevolence.\n“This austerity-obsessed government seems not to care about the plight of ordinary people, including the wellbeing of children. Brexit is on the horizon, bringing with it rising prices – the outlook is indeed bleak. Whilst the Scottish Government is committed to doing what it can to improve the situation, it requires full control over economic levers in order that child poverty can be properly addressed in a meaningful and responsible way”.",

Since then, she has:\n- Questioned former Prime Minister David Cameron in the House of Commons;\n- Coordinated a cross party letter from MPs representing no less than nine parties in the Commons – including the Conservatives – calling for the then Prime Minister, David Cameron, to drop his planned policy;\n- Launched the website www.scraptherapeclause.co.uk, which led to over 10,000 signatures on a petition, forcing the Government to respond to public opposition to the policy;\n- Questioned former Chancellor George Osborne in the House of Commons;\n- Met with Welfare Reform Minister, Lord Freud, to press him on key details of the policy which still, to this day, remain unanswered;\n- Prompted a response from the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child, who expressed grave concern about the planned tax credit cuts;\n- Questioned former Secretary of State for Work & Pensions Iain Duncan Smith in the Commons;\n- Published damning calls from PCS, one of the main civil servants unions in the UK, calling for the policy to be abolished.\nThis week, the campaigning MP has written to Downing Street, calling upon Theresa May to use the recent change in Government and forthcoming Autumn Statement to abolish the deeply flawed changes to tax credits.\nIn addition, Ms Thewliss was informed today (Tuesday) that she has been granted a Westminster debate, which she says she will use to “interrogate” Ministers on their proposed plans.\nCommenting, the Glasgow Central MP said:\n“Theresa May certainly wasn’t shy in weeding out many of the former Prime Minister’s allies in the cabinet, and she is obviously not afraid to do things differently from David Cameron.\n“Given that she’s had the courage to do this and to review some of the previous Government’s key policy commitments, I am today calling upon her to scrap a very real and serious policy which is still frightening vulnerable women and welfare charities all over the UK.\n“Since summer 2015, I’ve been pursuing the Government on their deeply flawed plans to restrict tax credit payments to two children per family.\n“Equally worrying is their medieval plan to introduce a rape clause, whereby certain exemptions will be made – and tax credits paid – if a women can prove her third child was conceived as a result of rape.\n“Earlier this year, I had an dreadful meeting with the Welfare Minister, Lord Freud, who struggled to answer basic questions and suggested that women in abusive relationships – where the majority of rapes still happen – should just flee. This showed the Minister to be completely ignorant of the very real dangers some women face.\n“I am pleased to have secured a parliamentary debate on this issue to interrogate the Government on their cruel and unworkable policy. Over a year on from announcing it, they still don’t know how it could be implemented.\n“A parliamentary debate, change in personnel in Government, as well as the forthcoming Autumn Statement, means that Theresa May has plenty of opportunities to do the right thing, stand up for vulnerable women and scrap the rape clause.\n“This needn’t be about saving face for the Prime Minister. It’s about this Prime Minister standing up for other women, doing the decent thing and getting shot of this wicked policy agenda”.",

Tory Ministers last week quietly used a negative statutory instrument to try and railroad the rape clause onto the statute books without a parliamentary debate or vote.\nThe Government has stated that it will expect nurses, doctors and social workers to act as third party arbitrators. This means that public service workers will have to judge whether or not a child has been conceived as a result of rape, simply in order for a woman to be exempt from the two child policy. Recent parliamentary answers given to Alison Thewliss MP suggest that the over 660,000 nurses, doctors and social workers in the UK have not been given adequate sexual violence awareness training to exercise the exemption.\nCommenting after Mr Speaker rejected her application, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“For 18 months, I’ve pursued this Tory Government relentlessly on its plan to introduce a pernicious two child policy and medieval rape clause. Today’s decision not to allow the emergency debate is incredibly frustrating, but I won’t just give up.\n“In determining that my application did not merit an emergency debate, the Speaker noted that I had tabled an arcane motion of prayer to annul the law – indeed, at the advice of Commons clerks. What the Speaker did not say was that the last time such a motion of prayer worked was in 1979. This is just one example of the many ways in which the procedures of the House of Commons are so arcane, irrelevant and medieval that it fails the people we, as MPs, seek to represent.\n“The clock is ticking; the rape clause is due to come into force in the next couple of weeks but I’ll keep on working to make this Government think again.”\nI was a social worker (in Probation) for 25 years before I had to take ill health retirement, Ive met perpetrators and survivors. I understand the issues around DV and sexual violence. But because I retired before the requirement to be registered, I would not be allowed to assist women with their applications, even if I was prepared to get involved with this atrocious and intrusive piece of legislation. I wish there was a way to get this overturned asap. A “prayer” has been tabled against the regulations, so what does that mean in the great scheme of things.

Often this has been due to trivial issues such as minor errors on tax returns, where the applicant’s character and credibility have been called into question as a result.\nThewliss’ question coincides with a protest being organised by the group ‘Highly Skilled Migrants’. The group, which represents hundreds of individuals from skilled backgrounds such as doctors, engineers and teachers, will gather at Westminster today to show their discontent at the Home Office’s approach.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“My constituent, Mr Ali Baig, is unfortunately one of many skilled migrants whose futures have been thrown into disarray by the Home Office’s hostile and heartless policies.\n“Highly skilled professionals are coming to the UK and taking up professional occupations where there are serious shortages. They are contributing to the economy, having families, making a life in our community, and yet the Home Office sees fit to refuse them permission to stay because they made a legitimate correction to their tax return. This is totally unacceptable.\n“These callous decisions have far-reaching effects. Many of the people affected have young children and other dependents, and by removing their right to work and remain in the UK the Home Office is placing huge burdens on entire families.\n“The Prime Minister needs to recognise that these Home Office policies are not fit for purpose. If she wants the UK to continue to attract people from around the world, she needs first to recognise and appreciate the contributions being made by those who are already here”.",

As a result of the work carried out with the families, the team provide information which helps social workers and legal decision makers to decide whether the child can be safely returned to the care of their family or if they should be adopted or remain in care permanently.\nAlison said:\n“I’m really pleased to have observed first-hand the work NSPCC Scotland do to support young mums in Glasgow – the charity through the enthusiasm and dedication of the nurses and health visitors is making a real difference to families who would be at increased risk of neglect without having support in place.”",

It follows months of consideration, research and scrutiny of the proposal by the Alcohol & Drug Partnership.\nGlasgow MP, Ms Thewliss, travelled to Dublin last month to meet with officials, politicians and the Ana Liffey drug project to learn more about SIFs and how they operate. The Irish Government has already announced plans for its first safe injecting facility to open early next year.\nSpeaking after today’s decision was taken, Ms Thewliss said:\n“The issues of discarded needles, the increase in infection rates and drug overdoses are not things people find easy to talk about. It is an uncomfortable subject and for too long it’s been an issue swept under the carpet. We cannot ignore this any longer.\n“The sad fact remains that this city has a public drug injecting population of approximately five hundred people, who are extremely vulnerable. I’ve seen with my own eyes people injecting in broad day light near to my office at Glasgow Cross. Dirty needles are regularly being discarded and it’s becoming a major public health risk, not only for the Council staff clearing them away but for local people finding syringes in their closes and near their homes.\n“As well as fearing for the safety of the drug injecting population, I am deeply concerned that members of the public could be injured by a discarded syringe.\n“I’ve been elected now for almost a decade and can see that this is an issue which is not going away. I’ve considered this very seriously, I can really see no other option but to move towards a supervised and safe injecting facility.\n“Research has shown that safe injecting facilities save lives, move drug injecting off the street and open up a vital dialogue between services and drug users. Safe injecting facilities can rapidly reduce the rate of deaths from overdose which must be at the forefront of our minds.\n“We need to ask ourselves a very difficult question. If someone I cared about was injecting drugs, where would I want them to be? Would I want them to be on dirty waste ground, in a dark city centre lane or a back court all alone, or supervised in the safety of a consumption room with trained medical staff available and services to help move them away from drugs in the longer term?\n“I welcome this very carefully considered step by the Integration Joint Board, believe it will improve public safety, and hope it is a first step to supporting this vulnerable population towards recovery.”\nWell done on this it really is the way forward. Glasgow will have less HIV contractions at a time when they have risen by 400% in the last year. Their will be less deaths, less crime and most importantly addicts will come into contact with treatment services they may not have in the past.",

Yet people should still feel free to enjoy the water, as with the correct education and awareness, this can be done safely.\nDrowning Prevention Week, which began on 18th June and continues until 25th June, encourages the public to be ready to enjoy being in, on, or around water this summer by ensuring that they and their families have a good understanding of water safety.\nLee Heard, Charity Director at RLSS UK said:\n“With June, July, and August proving to be the months with the most fatalities, it is vitally important that everyone understands water safety, especially during the summer months.\n“We want to ensure that everyone can enjoy their summer break and enjoy being in or around water but be safe in the knowledge that they, and their children, have the skills and understanding about water safety, which could potentially save a life.”\n“It is fantastic to have Alison Thewliss supporting our Drowning Prevention Week campaign and highlighting the issues surrounding water safety education and helping to educate communities in Glasgow Central.”\nOlympian Professor Greg Whyte OBE, said:\n“I have been privileged to work with the Royal Life Saving Society UK for many years, as we strive to spread awareness around water safety and help people to enjoy water safely.\n“Every MP who came along to our event, and who helps us spread the message and awareness of this important campaign is helping us reach our ultimate goal of zero water deaths, and for that I am grateful.”\nParalympian Ellie Robinson MBE, said:\n“While swimming ability is of course crucial, far more worrying is the statistic that some 40% of people who drown had no intention of entering the water in the first place. Only by spreading greater awareness of water safety can we help people to enjoy water safely and reduce fatalities.”\nThe event came quickly after the inaugural meeting of the All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) for Water Safety. This took place earlier this month and aims to establish more accessible water safety education across the UK to prevent future drownings.\nDamien Moore MP, Chair of the APPG on Water Safety, said:\n“Every drowning is a tragedy, and despite the RLSS UK’s excellent education campaign having reached an estimated 20 million people across the UK, these horrific accidents continue to happen.\n“It is my sincerest hope that by hosting this event in Parliament, we have helped to further spread awareness of how best to enjoy water safely, so that ultimately lives can be saved.\n“I want to thank the RLSS UK, along with every MP who came along to our event, for the vital work that they are doing in spreading awareness.”",

I was incredibly inspired to hear of the team’s dedication to offering confidential support to those who are affected by alcohol and drugs. In one form or another, FASS have been doing this important work for thirty years now.\n“It’s clearly important to help those with alcohol and drug addictions with their recovery and rehabilitation. FASS goes that one step further and offers vital practical support, advice and guidance to the family members of those who are affected by alcohol and drugs. What is even more impressive is the support they give to kinship carers, who are often the unsung heroes in our community.\n“With over twenty-one local support groups in the city, I would very much commend FASS to anyone who has a family member affected by drugs and alcohol. It’s really simple to just pick up the phone and dial 0141 420 2050. I know from meeting them this morning that the staff at FASS are compassionate, kind people who are dedicated to providing a first class service to families who need help at an incredibly difficult time.\n“A number of interesting policy issues were also raised this morning and I look forward to pursuing these on behalf of the service in the coming months.”",

These children have been through so much – fleeing conflict and persecution. I’m glad that the UK can help provide them with a safe home and a fresh start.”\n“As winter sets in I’m remain concerned about the plight of child refugees in Europe who are all alone and have no family with them.

Inflation has tripled since the UK Spending Review, where benefits and tax credits were set to be uprated by 3.1% in April this year – it’s now running at 9.1%. The Spending Review also predicted that inflation would peak at 4.4% in Q2 2022, which is less than half of the current rate. A real-terms cut to the Scottish government budget of 5.2% this year will impact Scotland’s recovery from the pandemic and put further pressure on services and public sector wages. Commenting, Alison Thewliss MP said: “The UK Tory Government continue to exacerbate the pain felt by people across the country as inflation worsens by cutting budgets to devolved governments. “Inflation is a global problem but the Chancellor is presiding over the highest inflation rate in the G7. “Allowing real-terms cuts to go ahead means further pressure on public sector wages and vital services for those in need. “It comes at the worst possible time for people struggling with the cost-of-living crisis. “Independent countries across the world are introducing measures to ease the burden on the public. Ireland has reduced public transport fares to help people save on ticket and petrol prices. “These measures are funded by borrowing. Scotland does not have the ability to help in this way because of the devolved funding arrangements. “The Scottish Government has done all it can with its fixed budget – uprating the Scottish Child Payment, making public transport free for under-22s, and expanding energy efficiency schemes to cut energy bills – but providing further support requires having control of more finance levers. “If Rishi Sunak refuses to mitigate cuts to the Scottish Government’s budget, he should support giving the devolved parliament the borrowing powers to do so itself.”",

This is a real inspiration to many young people.\n“It’s also great to see the Scottish Government doing its bit to support basketball at a grassroots level. The CashBack for communities programme recently awarded £492,800 to Basketball Scotland, allowing them to deliver 16 basketball school projects over a three-year period in some of the most deprived areas of Scotland. This speaks to the broad appeal that the sport is continuing to develop – something that I’m desperate to see continue.\n“Like many others, I’ve been extremely concerned by recent reports that basketball in the UK is facing a funding shortfall of almost £1m. With the Commonwealth Games due to start in only a matter of weeks, it’s crucial that the UK Government do the right thing to secure not only the future funding for the sport, but the places of the Scottish and England teams who have done so well to qualify”.",

The Prime Minister advanced that the UK Government has taken care to ensure the issue is dealt with sensitively, with Blackford countering that the clause is a disgrace.\nThe rape clause, or non-consensual sex exemption, has been in place for over a year, and forms part of the government’s wider policy to restrict Tax Credits and Universal Credit (child element) claims to the first two children in a family.\nEarlier this week, McVey defended the government’s record on welfare reform during an evidence hearing of the Social Security Committee at Holyrood.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“It really is repugnant to see the Prime Minister leaping to the Secretary of State’s defence on the issue of the rape clause.\n“Earlier this week Esther McVey described this vile policy as “extra help”, “an opportunity to talk” and “double support”. It is none of these things. By supporting it, the Prime Minister and her government are complicit in putting vulnerable women in harm’s way.\n“Experts in violence against women recognise that forced disclosure of abuse brings a significant risk of reliving that trauma. This should always be at a time of a woman’s choosing, not at the point where she has to make a choice about putting food on the table to feed her children.\n“Any defence of the two child limit and rape clause is truly reprehensible. The entire policy is ill-judged, cruel, and has nothing to do with supporting women. It must be scrapped.\n“I hope the Secretary of State will reflect on her words, and respond to my request for an urgent meeting without delay”.",

He is now facing eviction from his home, along with his wife and children, as he is unable to work until his case is heard. Other cases include a gentleman who has been waiting since November 2015 for an appeal regarding an entry visa for wife. Another constituent has been waiting since February 2015 for an appeal which had originally been promised by last May.\nMs Thewliss has welcomed the Leader of the House’s commitment to personally look into these cases. She commented:\n“These delays to tier one tribunals are totally and utterly unacceptable and the Government must take urgent action to speed up this process.\n“A snapshot of my own constituency caseload suggests that these delays are leaving people in incredibly precarious circumstances, leading to problems which, in all honesty, could easily be avoided.\n“A family in my constituency is now faced with eviction because of UK Government inaction. It is incumbent upon the Leader of the House to give his colleagues in the Government a nudge and get urgent action to tackle this backlog”.",

In addition, 3 million people have been displaced and 7 million Yemenis are on the brink of starvation.\nMs Thewliss’ speech focussed on the need for opening up access for humanitarian aid and food imports, which is being hampered by both parties to the conflict. She called on Ministers to secure the port of Hodeida, which has been bombarded by Saudi air strikes. On a practical level, she asked Ministers to help get cranes installed which would speed up the importing of much needed food.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“Yemen is in dire straits. Acute and severe malnutrition is resulting in innocent children dying needlessly. There have been a suspected 22,000 cholera cases in the last six months and, heartbreakingly, 63,000 children died in 2016 from preventable causes linked to malnutrition. This is a political decision; blockades by the Saudi-led coalition are preventing and delaying aid agencies from getting food into the region. Military action\n“The UK talks a good game when it comes to international aid for Yemen and it’s right to say that £85 million has been given in the last year. The UK Government is less keen to trumpet its revenue from Saudi Arms, with 143 licences granted at an eye watering value of £3.3bn. These arms are causing deaths, injuries and destruction of vital infrastructure in the port of Hodeida.\n“Yemen has been debated many times in Parliament. The time for talk is over – we need firm action now to help some of the most vulnerable people and children on the face of the planet who are seeking shelter every day from the British-made bombs being dropped on them by Saudi Arabia.\n“Without an immediate ceasefire and a political settlement, Yemen’s people will continue to be starved in a man-made and preventable famine.

Most professional musicians and performers rely on touring and travelling for their careers and livelihoods and gigs are often organised at short notice. As some performers can be working in several different European countries over the course of a few days, the possible introduction of work permissions and/or visas for British musicians touring and working in Europe could be extremely detrimental.\nAlison Thewliss MP says: “Today, I confirmed my support for professional musicians and performers in my constituency, and will urge the Government to ensure that they can continue to be able to travel easily across Europe post-Brexit for touring and performing with minimum administrative burdens”.\nHorace Trubridge, Musicians’ Union General Secretary says: “British musicians have long enjoyed easy access to touring in Europe, as UK venues and festivals have benefited from easy access to European performers. We know from touring in the US and elsewhere, that visas and other restrictions impose significant costs and administration, and occasionally considerable financial loss when visas aren’t processed in time.

It features 10 short chapters from 29 bereaved young people talking through their experience of coping with the gap their friend has left, trying to adapt their lives without them by their side and finding a ‘new normal’.\nThe booklet – which was launched during CRY’s annual Raising Awareness Week [19-26 November] – is part of a wider campaign #CRY4Friends, highlighting the grief felt by young people when they experience the death of a friend. www.cry4friends.org.uk\nAlison Cox says; “This powerful and deeply sensitive booklet articulating the thoughts and feelings of the sudden death of a fit and healthy special friend explains the ferocity of the impact of the loss.

These are the very “just about managing” families that the Prime Minister claims to support.\n“Whatever way you look at this, it’s bad policy making, it will be disastrous and the Government must use this consultation response to scrap these awful proposals now.”",

The training increases understanding of the needs of parents with young children or babies so parents can feel confident to ask for help where needed.

This can include unwanted attention and comments on their feeding method whether it’s by breast, bottle or in a high chair.

  "http_www_alisonthewliss_scot/https_www_alisonthewliss_scot_category_campaigns_page_10/content_749.html": "SNP MP, Alison Thewliss, has hit out at new data which suggests that the Government is failing miserably to get a grip on tackling low and exploitative pay.\nCommenting following the publication of answers to a series of written parliamentary questions she tabled, the Glasgow MP said Prime Minister Theresa May’s apparent desire to tackle the “burning injustices” in society, as well as efforts to support the “just about managing”, was nothing more than empty rhetoric.\nSeizing on data released to her by Treasury and Cabinet Office Ministers, Ms Thewliss said this wasn’t the first time she had raised the issue, having requested similar data from Government officials last year. Following that, she wrote a scathing letter to the former Prime Minister David Cameron, urging him to make tackling low pay a priority.\nCommenting, Glasgow Central SNP MP Alison Thewliss said:\n“Last summer might have seen a change of occupant in 10 Downing Street but it appears to be business as usual for this Tory Government; they appear to have no interest whatsoever in tackling pay inequality and exploitation. Theresa May’s impassioned speech on the steps of Downing Street has been exposed again and again as empty rhetoric.\n“Disappointingly, when I obtained last year’s data from the Government, over 100,000 Scots were still being paid below the national minimum wage. This is in stark contrast to the Scottish Government, and huge swathes of Scotland’s public services, who pay the real living wage of £8.45 per hour.\n“House of Commons Library figures reveal that for 2015-16 alone 950 employers have been found by HMRC not to be paying the minimum wage. Over the past decade only 13 prosecutions have taken place for non-compliance, which simply beggars belief.\n“These shocking figures also show that the Government is doing very little to crack down on employers who aren’t complying with National Minimum Wage legislation passed almost two decades ago. Indeed, the Minister’s response reveals the Government don’t think it’s worth prosecuting companies for non-compliance. This sends an incredibly worrying signal to exploitative employers who will think it is perfectly acceptable to pay peanuts for a fair day’s work.\n“If Theresa May is truly serious about supporting the “just about managing” in society, she needs to implement an urgent action plan.\n“The Prime Minister should start by cracking down heavily on exploitative employers who are flouting minimum wage laws. Companies won’t take this matter seriously if all they can expect is a rap on the knuckles.\n“Theresa May should implement a real living wage, as set by the Living Wage Foundation, rather than the pale imitation being punted by her Chancellor. The real Living Wage is being successfully promoted by the Scottish Government, with Scottish Canals being announced just this week as the 700th employer in Scotland to sign up.\n“Thirdly, and as part of an action plan, we need to have genuine pay equality – not just for women but for young people as well. Currently, the UK Government has a ridiculous system whereby minimum wage rates are set in accordance with age. That means if you’re a sixteen year old apprentice, the law says you can be paid as little as £3.40 per hour. How does that fit into the Prime Minister’s new obsession about a shared society?\n“I’ve written to the Prime Minister setting out three very simple and practical steps she could take to tackle this – I hope sincerely I won’t be sending the same action plan next year when I request these figures from the Government again”.",

Parliamentarians also got the chance to pose for photographs with Fairtrade Ambassador Nick Hewer, famous for his roles on Countdown and The Apprentice.\nFairtrade Fortnight 2018 will challenge the British public to open their doors to Fairtrade and help close the door on the exploitation facing farmers and producers in developing nations.\nThe nationwide campaign ‘Come On In’ runs from Monday 26 February until Sunday 11 March and will invite the public to come in to the world of the people who grow our food to see what life can be like when farmers and workers aren’t paid fairly. The campaign will explore how businesses, farmers, workers and shoppers can come together through Fairtrade to change this.\nThousands of events will be taking place around the country including breakfasts, breaks, bake-offs and more as people ‘Come On In’ and find out more about Fairtrade.\nAlison Thewliss MP said:\n“It is wonderful to be able to show my support for Fairtrade alongside my fellow parliamentarians.\n“Fairtrade Fortnight is a hugely important event and I would encourage the people of Glasgow to get involved wherever they can.\n“We can all play a role in ensuring a fair deal for farmers and producers in developing nations simply by ensuring we buy Fairtrade wherever possible.”\nCheryl McGechie, Director of Public Engagement, The Fairtrade Foundation said:\n“This Fairtrade Fortnight, we are inviting people to ‘Come On In’ to find out what Fairtrade does for farmers and see what exploitation looks like when trade doesn’t deliver.\n“There has never been a better time to stand alongside the people who produce the things we love to eat, drink and wear. People who often do not earn enough to feed, or provide for their own families.\n“This unfairness must end. By buying Fairtrade you are guaranteeing farmers a fair price for their efforts. This Fairtrade Fortnight ‘Come On In’ to Fairtrade.”\nBrad Hill, Fairtrade Strategy Manager at Co-op, said:\n“From selling the UK’s first Fairtrade bananas and the world’s very first own-brand product with the Fairtrade Mark, through to making entire own-brand categories Fairtrade we at Co-op have continued to drive the benefits of Fairtrade. We will continually look for ways and areas that we can develop to help make positive impact and life changes for farmers in developing countries.\n“Last year we extended our commitment further in a retailer first and announced that all the cocoa sourced for own brand products will be sourced on Fairtrade terms. This year we will be increasing our sourcing of the other core Fairtrade commodities to drive further Fairtrade Premium to producer communities. Our recent move saw us become the first in the world to adopt the new Fairtrade Sourced Ingredient program on flowers, meaning that all the African roses Co-op sources for use across our entire flower range will return a Fairtrade Premium.

The #BenefitsAware campaign, launched by national charity Turn2us, aims to raise awareness of unclaimed support that those in financial hardship may be unaware of.\nNew research by the charity found that half (50%) of low income households in Scotland are not claiming the welfare benefits and tax credits they could be entitled to. This is despite the fact that a huge 86% of this group have seen no improvement to their financial situation over the last year.\nNearly three-fifths (58%) of those in Scotland who aren’t receiving this support said they had been deterred from checking or claiming potential benefits entitlements because they did not think they would be eligible.

As a result, over three-quarters (77%) have not checked what welfare benefits they could be entitled to within the last year.\nFurthermore, over two-thirds (67%) would not consider checking their benefits entitlements if their income dropped, and only 2% would turn to a charity for help.

The benefits system can be a bit daunting, especially if you’ve never claimed before, which is why the Turn2us #BenefitsAware campaign is so important.\n“Over £15bn in welfare benefits went unclaimed last year with £2.8bn in Pension Credit not being taken up. It is nothing short of a tragedy that many of those who are entitled to that support are cutting back on essentials such and food or electricity, or turning to unscrupulous lenders.”\nTurn2us is urging anyone in need to use its free and confidential Benefits Calculator at Turn2us.org.uk to see what they could be entitled to and how to make a claim.

Another constituent has also been waiting since February 2015 for an appeal which had originally been promised by last May.\nCommenting on the data – which the Government released to her after Parliament broke for recess – SNP MP Alison Thewliss said:\n“Since my election almost twenty months ago, my team and I have dealt with over 5,000 constituency cases. Due to the diverse nature of Glasgow Central, a lot of my casework involves asylum and immigration policy.\n“Over the last year and a half, it has become ever more clear to me that UK immigration policy is not fit for purpose. These shocking figures demonstrate that this Government’s ‘pull up the drawbridge’ approach to immigration is leaving increasing numbers of my constituents in dire straits.\n“A family in my constituency face the very genuine prospect of being made homeless because of these unacceptable delays to tier one tribunals. Others are being separated from loved ones for extended periods. With an average of 5,000 appeals being lodged every month, it is quite clear that access to justice is being blocked by UK Government inaction.\n“A cynic would perhaps suggest that it is convenient for the Government to leave people waiting for months and years in the hope that they simply give up. That is no way to run a justice system and I’ll be seeking proper answers and action from the Ministry of Justice when Parliament returns next month.”",

Since then, she has:\n- Questioned former Prime Minister David Cameron in the House of Commons;\n- Coordinated a cross party letter from MPs representing no less than nine parties in the Commons – including the Conservatives – calling for the then Prime Minister, David Cameron, to drop his planned policy;\n- Launched the website www.scraptherapeclause.co.uk, which led to over 10,000 signatures on a petition, forcing the Government to respond to public opposition to the policy;\n- Questioned former Chancellor George Osborne in the House of Commons;\n- Met with Welfare Reform Minister, Lord Freud, to press him on key details of the policy which still, to this day, remain unanswered;\n- Prompted a response from the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child, who expressed grave concern about the planned tax credit cuts;\n- Questioned former Secretary of State for Work & Pensions Iain Duncan Smith in the Commons;\n- Published damning calls from PCS, one of the main civil servants unions in the UK, calling for the policy to be abolished.\nThis week, the campaigning MP has written to Downing Street, calling upon Theresa May to use the recent change in Government and forthcoming Autumn Statement to abolish the deeply flawed changes to tax credits.\nIn addition, Ms Thewliss was informed today (Tuesday) that she has been granted a Westminster debate, which she says she will use to “interrogate” Ministers on their proposed plans.\nCommenting, the Glasgow Central MP said:\n“Theresa May certainly wasn’t shy in weeding out many of the former Prime Minister’s allies in the cabinet, and she is obviously not afraid to do things differently from David Cameron.\n“Given that she’s had the courage to do this and to review some of the previous Government’s key policy commitments, I am today calling upon her to scrap a very real and serious policy which is still frightening vulnerable women and welfare charities all over the UK.\n“Since summer 2015, I’ve been pursuing the Government on their deeply flawed plans to restrict tax credit payments to two children per family.\n“Equally worrying is their medieval plan to introduce a rape clause, whereby certain exemptions will be made – and tax credits paid – if a women can prove her third child was conceived as a result of rape.\n“Earlier this year, I had an dreadful meeting with the Welfare Minister, Lord Freud, who struggled to answer basic questions and suggested that women in abusive relationships – where the majority of rapes still happen – should just flee. This showed the Minister to be completely ignorant of the very real dangers some women face.\n“I am pleased to have secured a parliamentary debate on this issue to interrogate the Government on their cruel and unworkable policy. Over a year on from announcing it, they still don’t know how it could be implemented.\n“A parliamentary debate, change in personnel in Government, as well as the forthcoming Autumn Statement, means that Theresa May has plenty of opportunities to do the right thing, stand up for vulnerable women and scrap the rape clause.\n“This needn’t be about saving face for the Prime Minister. It’s about this Prime Minister standing up for other women, doing the decent thing and getting shot of this wicked policy agenda”.",

Often this has been due to trivial issues such as minor errors on tax returns, where the applicant’s character and credibility have been called into question as a result.\nThewliss’ question coincides with a protest being organised by the group ‘Highly Skilled Migrants’. The group, which represents hundreds of individuals from skilled backgrounds such as doctors, engineers and teachers, will gather at Westminster today to show their discontent at the Home Office’s approach.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“My constituent, Mr Ali Baig, is unfortunately one of many skilled migrants whose futures have been thrown into disarray by the Home Office’s hostile and heartless policies.\n“Highly skilled professionals are coming to the UK and taking up professional occupations where there are serious shortages. They are contributing to the economy, having families, making a life in our community, and yet the Home Office sees fit to refuse them permission to stay because they made a legitimate correction to their tax return. This is totally unacceptable.\n“These callous decisions have far-reaching effects. Many of the people affected have young children and other dependents, and by removing their right to work and remain in the UK the Home Office is placing huge burdens on entire families.\n“The Prime Minister needs to recognise that these Home Office policies are not fit for purpose. If she wants the UK to continue to attract people from around the world, she needs first to recognise and appreciate the contributions being made by those who are already here”.",

Speakers included Katie Piper, television presenter and founder of the Katie Piper Foundation, feminist campaigner Caroline Criado-Perez, Angela Rippon, television journalist, newsreader and presenter and patients and Dr Gina Radford, Deputy Chief Medical Officer at the Department of Health.\nPaula Sherriff MP, Chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Women’s Health, said:\n“It is not acceptable that in 21st Century Britain, women are not treated with appropriate sensitivity and respect in our NHS. The NHS does an excellent job looking after us, but a universal culture should be adopted across the service where dignity is the key word.\n“I hope that our open letter to Jeremy Hunt and NHS England calling for this culture shift, and the launch of this Group, serves as notice that MPs are determined to campaign for an NHS where women are able to make confident informed choices about their own health and they are supported with respect and dignity.”\nAlison Thewliss MP stated:\n“I was keen to show my support for efforts to raise awareness of women’s health conditions that have not received the attention that they deserve. It is important that we all understand these conditions and ensure women are treated in the way that every patients wants to be, with the necessary dignity and respect.”",

She called upon Foreign Office Minister, Tobias Ellwood, to help provide certainty to Yemeni asylum seekers.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“It beggars belief that the Foreign Office are aware of the awful humanitarian crisis in the Yemen, yet the Home Office – in their characteristically obtuse manner – still have their heads in the sand.\n“The most recent Home Office statistics show that they’ve rejected asylum claims from thirteen Yemeni asylum seekers. Where exactly do they expect them to go if they don’t want to give them refugee status? Are they seriously suggesting they should return to Yemen which is quite literally a war zone?\n“Equally as bad is the fact that the Home Office have kicked another fifty-seven asylum applications into the long grass with no decision. These people urgently need certainty; people are lying awake at night worrying whether they will be forced to return to a country suffering brutal conflict and severe humanitarian disaster.\n“Ministers need to show some humanity and grant Yemeni citizens status in the UK, not leave them in fear of being returned to a war zone”.",

The SNP-led Scottish Government have already exceeded the level of their world-leading 2020 target for a 42% reduction six years early. I will continue to urge the UK Government to follow the excellent example set by the Scottish Government on reducing emissions and tackling climate change.”\nEach year, millions of people around the world come together to call for action to protect our brilliant planet.

The repeated claim by Ministers that controversial sites like the Bibby Stockholm barge, Wethersfield and Scampton would save money have been exposed as fallacy by this National Audit Office report.\n“Officials have acted in haste to meet political targets, and public funds have been filling the coffers of private companies, with very little by way of oversight.\n“The Home Office must focus instead on processing asylum cases and allowing those who have come to our shores for sanctuary to get on with rebuilding their lives, rather than leaving them languishing indefinitely in unsuitable and expensive accommodation.”",

That figure drops to just 7% if they are diagnosed at a late stage.\nAlison Thewliss MP said: “I was excited to hear Beating Bowel Cancer’s plans for the future and pleased to pledge my support for them.

If they know what to look out for, they can get checked out as early as possible. This could save their life – but only if followed by an earlier diagnosis and quicker treatment.\n“Prompt diagnosis and treatment of bowel cancer must be a priority for the NHS if we are to save more lives.”\nMark Flannagan, Chief Executive of Beating Bowel Cancer, said: “This event made it possible for us to share our plans and outline the key policy priorities that need to be realised in the next Parliament if bowel cancer survival rates are to improve.\n“We were pleased to have the opportunity to highlight these issues to those with the power to help tackle them and are very grateful to Alison Thewliss MP, for her interest. We look forward to working with her in the future to help raise awareness of bowel cancer issues in Glasgow Central.”\nHe told those at the reception: “In the time of this reception, four people will have died from bowel cancer; eight people will have been diagnosed with it.

This is pivotal as:\n- Every year in the UK approximately 7,300 women are diagnosed with ovarian cancer and sadly 4,200 women lose their fight – that’s 11 women every day.\n- Ovarian cancer is the sixth most common cause of cancer death in women and accounts for more UK deaths than all of the other gynaecological cancers put together.\n- Most women are not diagnosed until ovarian cancer has spread, which is why it is important that women know about the symptoms, so that they can seek advice as early as possible.\nAs part of the month-long campaign Make Time for Tea, the charity is encouraging people to hold a tea party where they raise awareness and funds for ovarian cancer. This campaign will raise vital funds for pioneering research into early detection and prevention.\nAlison Thewliss said:\n“I’m proud to be supporting The Eve Appeal throughout March to raise much-needed awareness of the little-known and little-talked about condition of ovarian cancer. It’s vital that we continue to raise awareness of and funds into ovarian cancer research in order to achieve earlier detection and prevention of this cancer before it even begins. I’d ask all my local constituents to look out for the key signs and symptoms of ovarian cancer and do what they can to support The Eve Appeal this March for Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month.”\nAthena Lamnisos, Chief Executive of The Eve Appeal said:\n“The biggest piece of mis-information out there is that ovarian cancer is a symptomless, ‘silent’ disease. Ovarian cancer isn’t silent. There needs to be much greater awareness of the symptoms.\n“Survival rates are low, few treatments available and few newer ones in the pipeline. What we often hear about is that diagnosis comes late – either because a woman hasn’t recognised the symptoms, or because her GP didn’t. This is something that must change.”\nThere are four main ovarian cancer symptoms:\n• increased abdominal size and persistent bloating (not bloating that comes and goes)\n• Persistent pelvic and abdominal pain\n• Unexplained change in bowel habits\n• Difficulty eating and feeling full quickly, or feeling nauseous\nThe charity advises local women to always follow the ‘rule of three’. If you’ve had symptoms for three weeks or more, then visit your GP.

This year Christian Aid Week is encouraging the British public to stand together with the millions of displaced people who have been forced to leave their homes around the world.\nAhead of Christian Aid Week, Alison Thewliss MP attended the event in Parliament to find out about activities and events taking place during the charity’s annual fundraising week in Glasgow Central. Last year, £12,614 was raised in Glasgow Central during Christian Aid Week.\nToday, more than 40 million people are internally displaced by conflict, accounting for approximately two thirds of those who find themselves forced from their homes. A further 24 million were displaced by disasters in 2016 alone. Yet, because they haven’t crossed a border, the general public rarely hear about them.\nDespite the huge number of people affected, situations of internal displacement receive almost no political attention, funding or support.\nChristian Aid works with local partner organisations around the world to help internally displaced people. This includes working with partners in Haiti, where thousands of people have been displaced by natural disasters in recent years.\nVilia was left homeless by the earthquake in 2010 and her mother was killed. Bereaved and homeless, for Vilia, her husband and their seven children, life became a struggle. They didn’t even have a safe place to sleep.\nChristian Aid’s local partner, KORAL, helps local people prepare for disasters. In the aftermath of the earthquake, it reached out to Vilia and built her and her family a new home, that was safe, stable and strong enough to stand up to natural disasters.\nAhead of Hurricane Matthew, KORAL was able to warn local communities, helping to evacuate around 5,000 families and saving many lives. In the immediate aftermath Christian Aid and KORAL distributed urgently-needed shelter materials, hygiene products such as soap, food seeds and cash, so people could buy other items that they really needed. Disaster-resistant homes were built, giving people safe, secure places to live. Of the dozens built before the hurricane hit, only one lost its roof in the disaster, and Vilia’s home was able to shelter 54 people over several days following the hurricane.\nAlison Thewliss said: “I was pleased to meet with Christian Aid this week, to hear about the great work that is being done in Glasgow Central and across the country to help people around the world who have been forced from their homes. For millions of people across the globe, Christian Aid’s work provides vital support. I encourage my constituents to get involved in Christian Aid Week events in Glasgow Central where they can.”\nSimon Kirkland, Christian Aid’s UK Parliamentary and Political Adviser, said: “We are very grateful for Alison Thewliss’s support for Christian Aid’s important fundraising events in Glasgow Central.

Panel members sit in on children’s hearings, which operate on a rota basis, and make decisions about improving children’s lives.\nThe Children’s Hearings System was set up in 1971 to deal with children who had committed criminal offences or were in need of care and protection. Since its establishment the Children’s Panel has played an important role in upholding children’s rights and it now focuses on ensuring the protection of children who have experienced abuse and neglect or who are at serious risk of harm.\nCommenting on the campaign, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“I’m delighted to give my support to the Children’s Hearings Scotland annual recruitment drive for Children’s Panel members.\n“Children’s Panel members are trained volunteers who come from a wide range of backgrounds and sit on hearings in the local communities in which they live or work. Their dedication to securing positive results for children who are at risk of harm or exploitation is truly inspiring.\n“Being a Children’s Panel member is a great opportunity to make a difference to the lives of the most vulnerable children in Glasgow. Children’s Hearings Scotland also provide valuable opportunities for training and personal development, including support towards a recognised qualification which is highly valued by employers.\n“I encourage constituents across Glasgow Central to take advantage of this worthwhile experience and apply to join the Children’s Panel today.”",

I have been asking questions for 15 months about this Tory Government’s appalling two-child policy and rape clause, but the Government still do not know how it will work. From one feminist to another, can the Prime Minister tell me how she justifies putting vulnerable women through the trauma of proving that their third child was born as the result of rape?\nThe Prime Minister: We have been clear that women who have a third child as a result of rape would not be subject to the limit that is being considered in relation to benefits. I absolutely recognise that the hon. Lady’s point addresses concern about dealing with individuals who have been through the trauma of rape, and that is why the Government are taking their time to consider that. We are consulting at the moment and looking at how to ensure that we do this in absolutely the right way.\nGovernment plans to restrict tax credits to two children – Westminster Hall debate – 12th October 2016\nAlison Thewliss (Glasgow Central) (SNP): I beg to move, that this House has considered Government plans to restrict tax credits to two children.\nIt is a pleasure to see you in the Chair, Mr Howarth.\nI come to this debate in great frustration. When I first uncovered this issue in the Budget on 8 July last year, I did not expect that I would still be talking about it one year, three months and four days later. Incredibly, unless the Minister can tell me differently this afternoon, the Government are still unable to say exactly how their pernicious and medieval policy will operate.\nTo set the context, the then Chancellor, the right hon. Member for Tatton (Mr Osborne), outlined in his Budget the Government’s intention to limit the child element of tax credits and universal credits to the first two children in a family. The Budget stated:\n“The Department for Work and Pensions and HMRC will develop protections for women who have a third child as the result of rape, or other exceptional circumstances.”\nNone of the questions asked on the Floor of the House or put directly to Ministers by me or my colleagues over the past year have been answered with a justification or explanation for this fundamentally flawed policy. I want to set out my anger about writing a rape clause into our social security system and about the wider impact of the two-child policy. Neither the rape clause nor the two-child policy is fit for a Government who proclaim their support for families.\nLet me deal with the rape clause first. I put on record the public opposition to it from Scottish Women’s Aid, Rape Crisis Scotland, Engender and the more than 10,000 people who signed a petition on the issue. I am deeply upset and disturbed with the attitude that the Government have taken to very vulnerable women and children. No woman should have to prove that she has been raped in order to get tax credits.\nI suppose it is not in the spirit of the chummy way in which people in this place like to do things, but I am unapologetic about the way I have spoken out about the meeting I had with the welfare Minister, Lord Freud, back in May. As he is a Member of the House of Lords, I have no opportunity to challenge or question him. I have been to many meetings in my eight years as an opposition local government councillor and in my year in this place, but I have never been so furious. For a Government Minister to open a meeting by saying “I’ve had to learn a lot more about this issue than I really wanted to” is appalling, and to go on to suggest flippantly that women facing the extremes of domestic violence should just flee demonstrates a dangerous ignorance. I hope the Minister will take the opportunity today to dissociate herself from her colleague’s comments. I do not think it is radical to suggest that Government Ministers ought to understand the implications of a policy before they inflict it on some of the most vulnerable people in our society.\nChildren being born of rape is not something that tends to happen because a rapist jumps out of the bushes and attacks a woman, as awful as that very rare circumstance is. Rape happens when women are so vulnerable and so powerless that they are in fear for their lives. Rape happens as the result of control in relationships. Rape happens in marriage. If a woman is in such a relationship, she is not going to nip down to her local jobcentre and report to a Government official that her child was born as the result of rape. For a start, with the single household payment in universal credit, she is not going to see the money in any case; it will go straight to her partner and he will know what she has done. Nor will she want to go through a third-party reporting mechanism, as suggested by Lord Freud. She will not want to tell her family GP. If the family are not known to the social work system, she will probably not want to alert social workers. She might not yet have sought the support of her local Women’s Aid or of other sources of assistance. She will almost certainly not want to contact the police just for the tax credits.\nThere is no clear statement from the Government on how their policy will operate. Once the rape is disclosed, what burden of proof will be acceptable to HMRC and the Department for Work and Pensions? After all, they are not organisations known for taking people at their word. What will the time limit be? Once a woman has left an abusive relationship and is in a position of safety, will she be able to make a claim retrospectively? Can that claim be backdated? For how long? If a woman needs to claim tax credits at a later stage in her life, because that is the nature of tax credits, will she need to trawl through her sexual history to identify that one of her children was conceived by rape?\nHow will a claim be recorded? I cannot conceive of a way of doing that that would not be hugely stigmatising both for the woman and for the child. Lord Freud suggested to me that it might take the form of a letter that a woman would have to retain in her records at home. I cannot imagine the distress caused if somebody else in the family came across that letter at a later stage. Alternatively, will the information have to be held on the woman’s records with DWP and HMRC? Will staff have access to it? Which staff? Will they receive appropriate training? The Public and Commercial Services Union has come out against the policy because of the difficult position it would put its members in.\nTax credits may be required at different stages in a woman’s life; would her claim be flagged up on any further occasion when a claim was made, or would she have to declare it on each separate occasion and relive that abuse again and again? Asking a woman to recount such abuse, perhaps on multiple occasions, to different officials is not protection in any sense of the word. The Government are not protecting any woman, or indeed any child, with this policy. In her heart of hearts, does the Minister believe that putting women through such trauma and humiliation is worth it? The rape clause must be scrapped.\nI will not be content, though, with solely removing the rape clause, because doing that would offer no protection to families either. The two-child policy must go too. Women’s Aid, the Child Poverty Action Group and the StepChange debt charity all believe that the policy runs counter to the Government’s much-vaunted family test and produces a perverse incentive for families to separate or for single parents to forgo entering new relationships.\nThe Government have stated that twins and multiple births will also be protected, but I have discovered that that is true only if the twins come after a single birth. According to the Government, people who have twins first have had their lot. That is despicable.\nThe letter I received from the Chief Secretary to the Treasury on 30 September stated that the Government’s intention was that\n“all families—those in receipt of benefits and those supporting themselves solely through work—will be faced with the same sorts of financial considerations when making decisions about having more children”.\nAside from sounding as if it has come from some kind of totalitarian regime, that statement is absolute nonsense. Quite evidently, not all families start from the same point, but all families are valuable and worthy of support. The state has a duty to protect the most vulnerable among us.\nThe Chief Secretary to the Treasury is also quite wrong in his assumptions about those claiming tax credits. Some 63% of families who currently receive tax credits for a third or a subsequent child are in work. They are the very “just managing” families that the Prime Minister referred to on the doorstep of Downing Street. Will she make good on her commitment through deeds and not just warm words? Pursuing the two-child policy would pull the rug from underneath the very families she claims to want to protect.\nThe two-child policy is completely disproportionate. The Child Poverty Action Group notes that 42% of those who claim child tax credits have only one child, 36% have two children, 16% have three children and only 7% have four or more children. The policy will have a devastating impact on those families and their income but a very limited effect on Treasury coffers.\nThe Chief Secretary to the Treasury’s claim about people\n“making decisions about having more children”\nfails to recognise that perhaps when a family had their children, they were well able to afford them. I also doubt that many families make life decisions solely on the basis of their future tax credit income. Is this the thin end of the wedge from the Government? Life is not that simple. It could take only sudden illness, the death of a partner or changes to circumstances that could not reasonably have been foreseen to plunge a family into a situation in which they might need to claim tax credits. The third child that we are speaking of already exists and needs to be cared for. The extra support that tax credits provide could make the difference that gives that family enough food to eat or the ability to pay their bills. Providing for people in such situations is the very essence of why social security exists.\nEvidence that I have received from StepChange demonstrates that if the two-child policy were applied to their current clients who have three or more children, 90% of those families would have absolutely no money left at the end of the month. The charity fears that, faced with mounting bills, unexpected everyday expenses and other commitments, those families will become extremely vulnerable to going into unmanageable debt. The cost of the bankruptcies that will follow will then end up being passed on to the state. StepChange’s research says that the average client that it deals with would be £327 worse off per month under the Government’s plans.\nThe policy also has very serious equalities implications, which the Government have not addressed at any stage. Concerns have been expressed to me by the Interlink Foundation, which represents the Orthodox Jewish community and which strongly believes that the policy will perpetuate disincentives to work for families with three or more children, as any additional earnings would reduce their entitlements. It will also make it impossible to achieve the Government’s aim of being better off in work. Interlink points out the substantial differential impact on religious communities, where reproduction, use of contraception and family size can be determined by beliefs and prevailing cultures, which the Government do not appear to have taken into account. According to Interlink’s figures, 52% of Jewish families have three or more children. For the Muslim community, the proportion is 60%. That stands in stark contrast to the population as a whole, out of which only 30% of families have three or more children. I am shocked that the Government have not addressed such a clear equalities issue.\nIt has been said by no less than the former Prime Minister—perhaps the Minister will repeat these claims today—that I am endlessly whinging, and that the Scottish Government now have the powers to deal with this issue. Those who say that are being extremely misleading, and also unfair to women and children in the rest of the UK, with whom I express my solidarity. The powers being transferred by the UK Government do not allow us in Scotland to set the eligibility criteria for child tax credits. Tax credits are a reserved benefit, and our Government in Scotland should not have to pay for the UK Government’s regressive policies. We have already spent £55 million on mitigating the hated bedroom tax. I would rather see the Scottish Government making positive choices, with all the powers of a normal Parliament, supporting families and lifting people out of poverty.\nDan Jarvis (Barnsley Central) (Lab): The hon. Lady is making a powerful speech and I very much agree with the argument she is advancing. I am pleased that she mentioned the Child Poverty Action Group; I pay tribute to the work it is doing on this matter. Does she agree that if the Government are determined to pursue such a punitive policy, at the very least they should publish an analysis of its impact on child poverty levels?\nAlison Thewliss: I absolutely agree. The United Nations suggests that impact assessments should be carried out on policies that affect children. Such an assessment appears not to exist for this policy.\nThe Scottish Government can provide top-up benefits where someone is already eligible, but not where they are not. There is also a gap: the two-child policy and the rape clause come into force early next year, but it is unlikely that the full range of social security powers will be operational in Scotland until 2018.\nI shall conclude by speaking briefly about our obligations to protect and support children. I contend that the limiting of the child element of tax credits and universal credit to the first two children in a family runs counter to our obligations under the United Nations convention on the rights of the child. We are obliged by article 2 of the UNCRC not to discriminate on the basis of birth, but the two-child policy clearly does so, by apportioning value according to when the child was born into a family. We are obliged under article 3 to make the best interests of the child a primary consideration, but the two-child policy and the rape clause stigmatise, and say that the Government do not value all children equally. They also limit working parents’ ability to feed and care for the children they already have. We are obliged under articles 26 and 27 to provide access to social security and an adequate standard of living, to assist parents in the bringing up of their children. The two-child limit completely undermines that right.\nThe UN Committee on the Rights of the Child and the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights have both recently investigated the UK for its approach to welfare reform and highlighted in very strong terms their concerns about the Government’s austerity agenda and the cuts to tax credits that have already happened. In its July report, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child stated that it was\n“seriously concerned that…Recent amendments to the Tax Credits Act (2002), the Welfare Reform Act (2012) and the Welfare Reform and Work Act (2016) have limited the entitlement to child tax credits and social…regardless of the needs of the households”.\nThat is absolutely appalling. In their report to the UNCRC, the UK’s Children’s Commissioners said that:\n“measures should not discriminate against children from particular groups for example children of lone parents, children with disabilities or children from large families.”\nThe rape clause and the two-child policy do discriminate in those ways.\nThe two-child policy and the rape clause fundamentally punish families for the circumstances they are in— circumstances that may be beyond their control and in which children already exist. I urge the Minister and the Government to act in the best interests of children, as our international commitments make clear they must. I urge them to stand up for the most vulnerable in our society. Families in situations of poverty, who are working hard and doing their best, are extremely vulnerable. Women who have been raped are extraordinarily vulnerable. The Government need to think incredibly carefully about how they wish to pursue these policies, if they wish to pursue them at all. I call on the Government to protect the “just managing”—those people they say they value and wish to support—and to scrap the abhorrent rape clause and the pernicious and discriminatory two-child policy.\nPrime Minister’s Questions – 6th July 2016\nAlison Thewliss (Glasgow Central) (SNP): Q13. The UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights recently joined the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child in expressing serious concerns about this Tory Government’s brutal welfare cuts. How much more international condemnation will it take before the Prime Minister drops his regressive two-child policy and scraps his rape clause?\nThe Prime Minister (Mr David Cameron): What we have seen under this Government is many more people in work, many fewer households where no one works, and many fewer households with children where no one works; all those have been a huge success. Of course, the hon. Lady and her party have an opportunity, now that we have made some huge devolution proposals, including in the area of welfare: if they do not think that what we are doing on a UK basis—[Interruption.] I do not know why you are all shouting. You are getting these powers; instead of whinging endlessly, you ought to be starting to use them.\nInternational Women’s Day debate – 8th March 2016\nAlison Thewliss (Glasgow Central) (SNP): When we miss out women from our legislatures, we make grave errors that seriously affect women and their families: we do not give the attention we should to maternal health and breastfeeding; we do not consider the impact of legislation on women; we leave women destitute without recourse to public funds; we get a Chancellor who believes that women paying the tampon tax for their own domestic abuse services is appropriate; and we see the introduction of welfare reforms such as the household payment in universal credit, the two-child tax credits policy and the rape clause.\nIn the brief time I have, I would like to concentrate on the two-child policy and the rape clause. It is a vindictive piece of policy that passes judgment and says the Government consider only the first two children worthy of support. To ask a woman to prove that her third child has been born as the result of rape to gain eligibility for child tax credits is utterly abhorrent. It stigmatises that woman and her child and is inconsistent with our obligations to treat children equally under the UN convention on the rights of the child.\nThere seems to be an assumption by some that rape just happens somehow. It is not acknowledged that it is most likely to happen to women already in coercive, abusive relationships. These women are in a particularly vulnerable place.\nDrew Hendry (Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey) (SNP): My hon. Friend will be aware of the additional funding announced by Scotland’s First Minister today to help abused women get back into work. Does she agree that we need more of these initiatives across all Governments to help women in such positions?\nAlison Thewliss: I absolutely agree with my hon. Friend.\nMembers will be aware that I have been questioning the rape clause since last July’s Budget, but I have still not had a satisfactory answer to explain why this policy is required and how it will work. Lord Freud suggested on 27 January in the other place that proof that a woman’s third child was born of rape might not come via the criminal justice system, but instead come from a third-party official such as a GP or a social worker. This does not, however, resolve the problem. For many reasons, these women may not be able to tell their GPs about their circumstances, and there may be no social work involvement.\nI am not sure how many women will end up claiming under this policy. If a woman is in a relationship and suffering domestic abuse, she might be putting herself at serious risk by making the claim in the first place. A similar issue arises in the household payments system and universal credit—if a woman requests a split payment, her partner will almost certainly know about it. She may well be doubly damned by this Government, because Lord Freud has also refused to allow an exemption to the two-child policy for women escaping abusive, controlling relationships, which is what the Scottish Government are trying to counteract.\nThere is still a distinct possibility that a woman could tell her story to the Department for Work and Pensions and Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs and not be believed. Those organisations are not known, after all, for taking people at their word. There is not yet guidance, and the Government will not say who they are consulting.\nThe two-child policy also fails completely to recognise the complex nature of families in 2016. A couple who have children from previous relationships will, under the two-child policy, lose their child tax credit eligibility when they come together. There is no detail yet on exactly how multiple births will be protected. There is no acknowledgement of the impact on those who, for religious reasons, may traditionally have larger families. That is hardly fitting for a Government who vaunt their “family test”.\nI have heard it said that families should have only the children they can afford, but that point of view does not acknowledge the challenges that life presents. A family may have three children and be well able to afford them, but what if one parent loses their job, takes ill or dies? There is no safety net whatever in the two-child policy to cover that eventuality, particularly if the remaining parent is required to work less to care for the family.\nThe two-child policy is rigid, ineffectual and unnecessary. The rape clause stigmatises vulnerable women and their families. This is a policy made on the hoof for the sake of a Daily Mail headline and a Tory conference press release. It is tantamount to social engineering. My plea on International Women’s Day 2016 is that we reject this kind of policy—the two-child policy and the rape clause—and we support every woman and every child equally.\nTopical Questions – 1st February 2016\nAlison Thewliss (Glasgow Central) (SNP): Does the Secretary of State believe that the two-child policy and the rape clause are consistent with his Government’s obligations under the UN convention on the rights of the child?\nMr Duncan Smith: I am quite convinced that the proposals that we bring forward will make it absolutely certain that all those who suffer rape will not be put upon in any way by this proposal.\nPrime Minister’s Questions – 16th December 2015\nAlison Thewliss (Glasgow Central) (SNP): Q4. The Prime Minister promised during the election campaign that he would not restrict child benefits to two children. Since then, he has not only reneged on that but, as a result, brought in the rape clause for women in order for women to receive child benefits. Since July, I have asked a number of his Ministers a number of times, and nobody has been able to tell me how this will work. Will he now drop the two-child policy and the rape clause?\nThe Prime Minister: First of all, we have made it absolutely clear, and let me make it clear again, that there is no question of someone who is raped and has a child losing their child tax credits or their child benefit—no question at all. But is it right for future claimants on universal credit to get payments for their first two children? I think that it is.\nPrime Minister’s Questions – 9th December 2015\nAlison Thewliss (Glasgow Central) (SNP): Q6. Since the Chancellor’s Budget in July, I have asked time and again how he intends to make women prove, in order to qualify for tax credits, that they had their third child as a result of rape. Will he now admit that his abhorrent, vile policy is completely unworkable, and will he drop the rape clause? [902488]\nMr Osborne: It is perfectly reasonable to have a welfare system that is fair not just for those who need it but for those who pay for it. We have identified the specific cases that the hon. Lady refers to in her question, in which women have been victims of domestic abuse—or, indeed, rape—and that is why we are consulting and discussing changes to protect vulnerable women.\nTopical Questions – 7th December 2015\nAlison Thewliss (Glasgow Central) (SNP): The Minister said earlier that there is no place for domestic violence in our country, and I firmly agree with him. When will he confirm how his Department intends to make women prove that they have had their third child by rape?\nMr Duncan Smith: I missed the question, Mr Speaker. There was a lot of noise, so I did not hear it.\nMr Speaker: The hon. Lady was asking about the treatment of someone who has a third child through rape\nMr Duncan Smith: My apologies to the hon. Lady. May I say to her that we will come back with our exact reasons and rationale for how we will decide that? The reality remains, however—and this is, I believe, popular among the public—that those who make choices and take responsibility for them want everyone else to do the same as well.\nBusiness Questions – 29th October 2015\nAlison Thewliss (Glasgow Central) (SNP): Since the opening of today’s sitting, welcome news has emerged from China that it is to end its one-child policy. Will the Leader of the House arrange a debate in Government time on the workings of their two-child policy, with particular reference to the “rape clause”?\nChris Grayling: Of course, full details will become available. I am aware of the issue and will ensure that the fact that the hon. Lady has continued to raise this concern is communicated to my colleagues.\nWelfare Reform and Work Bill – Report Stage – 27th October 2015\nHannah Bardell (Livingston) (SNP): I welcome my hon. Friend the Member for Airdrie and Shotts (Neil Gray) to his position as I move across to the business brief. From his speech earlier, I am sure the social justice team has a very talented member.\nI shall speak to amendments in this group tabled by my colleagues, particularly amendments 53, 54 and 55, which clearly state the SNP’s opposition to the Government’s two-child policy. The SNP wholeheartedly condemns the Tory Government’s intention to restrict tax credits to two children, which by definition excludes many of the poorest children in society from our social security system, going against the very principles for which it was set up. The Government’s proposals also stray into an area of policy making that I never thought I would see suggested by any Government who had a shred of compassion for their people. Hidden away in the Red Book were the words:\n“The Department for Work and Pensions and HMRC will develop protections for women who have a third child as the result of rape, or other exceptional circumstances.”\nNo detail was provided. How much disrespect can this country take?\nAlison Thewliss (Glasgow Central) (SNP): Does my hon. Friend agree that it is appalling not only that that appeared in the Budget statement, but that during the consideration of the Bill there has been no explanation of how that will work in practice?\nHannah Bardell: I could not agree more. The two- child policy will hit more than 872,000 families who receive support for third and subsequent children. The Government’s own national child poverty strategy recognises that the risk of poverty is much more significant in larger families than in smaller ones. Currently a third of children living in poverty live in families with three or more children. Perhaps that is why the Tory Government seek to airbrush child poverty from the statute books.\nIt is easy for this Tory Government to espouse theories and claim that reducing financial support to just two children will make poorer families rethink their “financial choices”. That is based on the falsehood that all children are planned and that it is possible to financially plan for children. I am sure we are aware that that is not the case. What if a second pregnancy turns out to be twins or even triplets? What about the many families who are supported or led by kinship carers? Perhaps the Tories need a biology lesson, or a simple lesson in humanity.\nSuch eventualities cannot be planned for, so are we telling families across these nations to stop having children, just in case? I have raised many times in Committee, and many of my colleagues have raised on the Floor of the House, the sensitive issue of children resulting from rape and the insensitive Government plan to make women justify their children in front of DWP caseworkers. Many domestic abuse charities have expressed grave concerns, and Rape Crisis Scotland has warned that the plan is “inherently unworkable”. It has asked how DWP workers will prove whether someone has or has not been raped, and said that many women would find explaining that situation extremely uncomfortable. Many women do not report to the police that they have been raped, or go years without reporting it or speaking about it, so they cannot be expected to explain it to a DWP worker.\nWhat training will a DWP worker have to deal with rape victims? It is clear that this is an unrealistic, ill thought out and unhelpful proposal. In evidence before the Select Committee on Work and Pensions, stakeholders described it as “unpalatable”, and the hon. and learned Member for Holborn and St Pancras (Keir Starmer) wrote in The Guardian recently:\n“A rape test for welfare is a chilling way to save money”.\nI could not agree more. It just goes to show that at the height of the Tories’ insensitivity, they will quite literally leave no vulnerable group untouched in their scramble to, as they put it, balance the books. The policy will ultimately result in a complete abuse of rape victims’ privacy, leading to potentially serious emotional damage for children should they become aware that they are a child resulting from a rape. The SNP amendments would see the policy abolished, and we urge the Government to remove the two-child policy from tax credit and universal credit to ensure that no victim or child goes through the torment associated with having to justify a third child due to such an horrific crime being inflicted—\nMadam Deputy Speaker (Mrs Eleanor Laing)\nOrder. I am sure that the hon. Lady is about to conclude.\nHannah Bardell: If we as parliamentarians are in this place to legislate for those we represent, let us legislate well and with compassion and good conscience. The proposals do not make good legislation. They are wrong for our society and wrong for this generation, so I ask Members to think again and vote with us.\nBudget Resolutions debate – 13th July 2015\nAlison Thewliss: Does the hon. Gentleman consider it fair that a woman who has been raped will have to declare that to Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs and the Department for Work and Pensions to qualify for her child to receive tax credits?\nRichard Fuller: The hon. Lady repeats a point that one of her colleagues made in an earlier day of the debates on the Budget. We need to examine in this debate the broad range of the impact of the Government’s policies. When the Government make any change, they are moving big blocks around—that is one reason why I am a Conservative, actually. When that happens, there will be specific examples of an impact on people’s lives that the general policy was not supposed to have. The hon. Lady should raise those instances directly with Ministers, so that changes can be considered. However, we should not undermine the entire sweep of Government policy because of a particular example. I have found the Government reasonable in understanding the need for certain changes to benefit policies if they have a deleterious impact on individuals.\nBudget Resolutions debate – 13th July 2015\nAlison Thewliss (Glasgow Central) (SNP): It is a dubious honour to be called to speak in this Budget debate—not because I am not keen to speak on behalf of my party and my constituents, but because so many things about it still upset me deeply. I raised the issue last week, but I have yet to receive an answer on the provision set out at the top of page 88 of the Red Book. Specifically, what kind of system will the Department for Work and Pensions and Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs introduce to ask women who have been raped to prove it in order to qualify for child tax credits? I still seek clarification on that appalling clause, and I hope that the Secretary of State will eventually be able to give it. I know how hard my constituents and people across these islands will be hit by the Budget. I stand here on behalf of my party to do my best to represent them and fight their corner today. I will speak first about the impact on communities, and then I will discuss investment and city deals.\nThe Secretary of State for Work and Pensions once claimed he could live on £53 a week. I am not clear whether he tried, but I know that more than 480,000 people signed a petition asking him to do so. As Members of this House, we are comfortably off. Even if we were suddenly to lose our jobs, as so many hon. Members’ colleagues in Scotland did in May, I suspect that none of us would starve. That is not the daily reality of life for many people across the United Kingdom today. Even when people are in employment, they do not earn enough to live more than hand to mouth. We in this House do not have the right to pull up the ladder and leave them behind. Let us be in no doubt—this is not because our lowest-paid do not work hard enough. Many work extraordinarily hard for long hours doing difficult, dirty and dangerous work. They need our support and they need our respect. Most of all, they need fair pay— a real living wage, not some hastily badged imitation—and access to Government support mechanisms such as tax credits to help them live with dignity. This Government should apologise to the Living Wage Foundation for stealing the campaign it has worked so hard to build.\nI was glad to hear of the shadow Secretary of State’s conversion, because an Opposition who oppose opposing are no good at all. I urge all Labour Members to remember the toil of many people in our country struggling to make ends meet when they consider backing the Tories’ Budget. Those people elected Labour Members to stand up for them, not for the Secretary of State.\nThis Tory Budget has been assessed by groups such as the Fawcett Society as being disproportionately hard on women. The Fawcett Society considers that this Budget gives with one hand and takes away with two, stating:\n“Women are going to be pushed further into a poverty trap following a Budget that offers little to help them increase their income…We fear that many more will find themselves in a low benefit, low wage situation that is increasingly difficult to escape.”\nThe House of Commons Library says that, since 2010, 85% of the £26 billion-worth of cuts made to benefits, tax credits, pay and pensions has been taken from women’s incomes. That is unacceptable. I ask all feminists in this House to consider it very carefully.\nThe communities I know best are resilient. They look out for one another and make sure their neighbours are okay. They collect for food banks. They donate what little they have to ensure that their vulnerable neighbours are looked after. The sharp increase in food banks in this country is a stark example of a community response to crisis. Visits to food banks increased from 25,899 in 2008-09 to 1,084,604 in 2014-15, according to the Trussell Trust’s figures. This speaks to a crisis in our policies in this nation and a very human response by ordinary people to that crisis. We should not have a requirement for food banks in a wealthy nation such as ours. Being ahead in our GDP and our status is not important when people are starving.\nWhat shocks me most is the role of our social security system in forcing people to use food banks. The Trussell Trust’s figures show that just shy of 30% of people are using food banks because of benefit delays: families cannot feed themselves because of an administrative problem. That is absolutely unacceptable and shameful. Twenty-two per cent. of people use food banks due to low income. These people have jobs, but because of their pay and the uncertainty around zero-hours contracts they do not earn enough to eat. This is not right. We must act and not accept the Tory narrative, shake our heads, and throw up our hands.\nThe benefits statistics from advice agencies such as the citizens advice bureaux show further evidence of an unfair system that exacerbates the poverty in our communities. In the category of benefits, tax credits and national insurance advice, one single citizens advice bureau in the Bridgeton area of my constituency saw an increase in its caseload from 4,092 in 2011-12 to 7,266 in 2014-15. Its evidence shows that delays are built into the social security system at every stage, through application, mandatory reconsideration, and appeals. When people are supported by agencies such as the CAB, they are far more likely to be successful in those appeals. That clearly speaks to a system that is off-putting and difficult to navigate; it is not people-friendly. On Friday I learned of a person who waited over a year for his personal independence payment case to be processed—a whole year, for someone who needed support more than most. Who picks up the pieces? Neighbours, friends, churches, and community organisations filled the gaps when this Government forced citizens to the brink. The Government’s Budget undermines people’s sense of community and puts unsustainable strain on the vital services so many rely on.\nI have seen the impact of cuts to local government over the past few years. During that time, the Scottish Government have done their utmost to protect local government from the worst of the cuts it has faced, but decisions have already resulted in significant detriment to services. Cuts were made to the flesh, with efficiency savings, reductions in office costs, and the need to work smarter. Cuts were then made to the muscle—to the staff—\nDavid Rutley (Macclesfield) (Con): I am listening to the hon. Lady with interest. Does she believe that there is any room at all for reform of the benefits system or the welfare approach to encourage more people to get into work, or support them into work, or is everything perfect in Scotland?\nAlison Thewliss: When the powers this Government have force people into poverty and do not help to support them at their time of need, I say that that is a crisis and that we are hamstrung in our ability to help people. This Government expect the Scottish Government to mitigate the worst of their policies, but we should not exist to do so. Give us the powers, and we will do what we can.\nCuts have now come to the bone. Service provision has been removed, including things that make no logical sense to cut because such low-level interventions save money down the line. Sheltered housing services, which keep the elderly active, and services such as the Glasgow Association for Mental Health, which prevents those with mental health problems from slipping into crisis, have had their funding removed. This makes no sense: we can spend to save by investing at a certain level, but the cuts now mean that local government has to make such choices.\nI do not know what the full impact will be of cuts that are starting to amputate huge chunks of our local bodies, but I very much worry that they will threaten the life of the patient. Local government serves both a social and an economic purpose, and the shrinking of public services takes well-paid and useful jobs out of areas and damages small business. In the past few days, the Local Government Association analysis has suggested that a £3.3 billion cut in 2016-17, or some 12%, will mean potentially devastating choices in many areas. These are not arbitrary cuts or figures on a balance sheet; they affect lives.\nThe proposed housing changes will have a significant impact. In Scotland, we take the attitude that a house is a home. That does not vary depending on whether someone’s house is a bought house or a rented one. I know from my case load that a social rented home in Glasgow is very desirable indeed. The huge numbers on housing waiting lists highlighted by organisations such as Shelter certainly seem to bear that out.\nA lot of what has been said in the Budget seems to assume that markets will take care of the housing crisis in this country, but I would turn that contention on its head. The commercial rental market has driven up rents to the point at which people on average or even generous wages cannot afford to live, particularly in this city.\nRichard Fuller: The acting leader of the official Opposition has said that their goal is not to oppose just for the sake of doing so. The hon. Lady has not mentioned anything in the Budget with which she agrees. Does she disagree with the acting leader of the Opposition?\nAlison Thewliss: The hon. Gentleman will find that the Scottish National Party takes its own stance on many issues and does not follow the Labour party.\nThe problem with market rents is not, as the Red Book implies at paragraph 1.154, with social rents. I believe that, by and large, council and housing association rents are fair, not subsidised. I was glad that the shadow Secretary of State mentioned the proposed pay-to-stay policy, and I agree with a lot of what she said on that. The policy will drive people out of the communities they call home, push out key workers on modest salaries and all but ghettoise swathes of our towns and cities. The proposals are unfair in that local authorities will not see the benefit of the policy, because their share from increased rents will go back to the Exchequer, while local housing associations get to keep the funds. If the Government insist on pursuing this daft policy, they should at least give an even playing field to all housing providers to allow them to invest in new housing.\nI note that there is a proposal to end so-called lifetime tenancies. Long tenancies can contribute positively to the fabric of our communities by ensuring that people stay and make their lives in an area and that they belong to it. They are part of what makes renting with a housing association or a local council attractive, as opposed to the uncertainty of the private sector, where people have to move all the time.\nAndrew Bridgen: The hon. Lady is making her case, but is there anything in the Budget with which she agrees? Does she support the new national living wage and the cut in rents for housing association tenants?\nAlison Thewliss: I have made it abundantly clear that it is not a living wage; it is a rebadging of the national minimum wage, and it is not good enough. [Interruption.] Would Government Members give me a break?\nLong tenancies give a degree of certainty and reduce costs to housing providers, who know that a tenant is there for the long term and do not constantly have to manage the turnover of stock. That is costly for housing associations and local councils to manage, so knowing that a tenant will stay reduces their costs. The Government should think very carefully about this policy’s impact on well-established and strong communities.\nThis Government seem to be making a further attack on the social rented sector and its tenants, following the distress caused by the bedroom tax. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation has found that only 6% of affected tenants were actually able to move, and that 50% of those who did not move fell into arrears. I am glad that the Scottish Government were able to mitigate that, but it is another example of a policy built to deal with a London problem that did not exist in Scotland, and which simply punishes people for their circumstances. The Scottish Government should not exist simply to mitigate the policies of another Government. That is unfair and unsustainable.\nThe Government are also in real danger of undermining their own work on city deals. One of the intended outcomes of the Glasgow and Clyde Valley city deal is to help long-term unemployed people back to work, and if the actions of this Tory Government undermine that by slashing benefits and making life harder for people who are looking to work, that will undermine the potential success of the deal. We must co-ordinate and work together. We need job-creating powers in Scotland and more than the simple power to mitigate the wrongheaded approach of this Government.\nAlthough I say that, the hon. Members for North West Leicestershire (Andrew Bridgen) and for Bedford (Richard Fuller) will be glad to find that I welcome the further development of city deals in the Budget. They will go some way to redressing the imbalance in the UK economy, and not before time. Looking at the rhetoric about the northern powerhouse, I would suggest that it is perhaps a final admission of the fundamental failure of the UK economy. London is indeed the giant suction machine that the former Business Secretary spoke of, and the map on page 67 illustrates that investment in the south and east of England is focused through the prism of how best to serve London rather than to build up those areas in their own right and advance the economy.\nI have attended Adjournment and Westminster Hall debates on city deals for Aberdeen and Cardiff and I listened with great interest to the debate on elected mayors. I have also followed discussions on the Cities and Local Government Devolution Bill in the other place. I am keen to see the development of deals that meet local needs and have been disappointed in some of those debates to find that the wishes of local people seemed to rank behind the pet project of some local authorities and the requirements of business. If more powers come to cities, it should be to serve the ambitions and priorities of local people to raise their opportunities in life and to make things better according to local demands. They must also be the devolution of funding to match those powers, as devolution and the reform of local government cannot be a cover for passing on cuts.\nI am of course delighted to see continued commitment to the city deal for Glasgow and Clyde Valley, which the UK Government established in partnership with the Scottish Government, each putting in £500 million, with £130 million coming from the eight local authorities involved. I hope, too, that the deal will involve listening to local people. It is early days and the work of the joint board is just getting under way. I commend the fledgling city deals for Aberdeen and Inverness, which are mentioned in the Red Book, and ask that attention be paid to potential deals in Scotland’s other cities.\nIn considering city deals, we must also consider how we support areas outwith large conurbations. Rural areas should not be left behind, and if they are it will only exacerbate the difficulties of rurality. The approach in Scotland has been about collaboration through the Scottish Cities Alliance rather than cutthroat competition, and I believe that that is more productive. Setting regions against one another and failing to seize the opportunities to make links will only waste money in the long run. I note with interest that an Oyster-type system is being considered for Manchester. That is of course welcome, but it should not operate in a way that builds barriers between different regions. There is much opportunity for interoperability rather than running in entirely different directions and I note with some concern the comments made by the hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Robert Neill) about incentives for businesses. If we are not careful, that could lead to a race to the bottom on standards in different areas.\nI would also guard against the temptation to reach for shiny prestige projects at the expense of more sustainable projects that benefit local communities and urge that further attention is paid to the importance of community benefit policies within public contracts. They were used effectively in Glasgow during the Commonwealth games and on other projects and are a simple way to ensure that local people get jobs, training and investment in every large or small infrastructure project that comes along.\nA Westminster Hall debate last week touched on the fact that elected mayors had been rejected in some areas in local referendums. It would seem to me to be unwise to overrule that democratic right, but the Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, the hon. Member for Nuneaton (Mr Jones), said:\n“I reiterate that where there is a request for the ambitious devolution of a suite of powers to a combined authority, there must be a metro mayor, but no city will be forced to take on those powers or to have a metro mayor, just as no county will be forced to make any governance changes.”—[Official Report, 9 July 2015; Vol. 598, c. 187WH.]\nThat seems to make no sense and to disrespect local democracy. People can have the funding, but only if they have the mayor. If people do not want a local mayor and think that the power is better vested in their local authority and local democracy, the Government should respect that. Members might also like to note that there is no such obligation for the Glasgow and Clyde Valley plan to come with an elected mayor.\nRobert Neill: The hon. Lady is making an interesting point, but if she trusts local authorities in that regard it is legitimate to trust them to vary certain levels of taxation within an area and to increase their prudential borrowing against a revenue stream. Would she support us on such measures?\nAlison Thewliss: Having come from local government, of course I trust it to do those things, but it should not be forced with a gun put to its head.\nI will close by asking the Secretary of State to reflect on the purposes of power being devolved, and on how best we support local communities. People will be unsurprised that we in the SNP reject the austerity agenda, and the people who voted for us support our policy. That austerity agenda has already led to so much damage to the fabric of our communities, and there is only so much that people can take.\nBudget Resolutions debate – 9th July 2015\nDr Eilidh Whiteford (Banff and Buchan) (SNP)\nWhen the Chancellor delivered his Budget speech yesterday, he made the oft-repeated claim that the\n“best route out of poverty is work.”—[Official Report, 8 July 2015; Vol. 598, c. 333.]\nThat was probably true once, but it is no longer true—it has not been true for a number of years. The truth today is that, for millions of low-paid workers, poverty persists no matter how many hours or how hard they work. For people who are bringing up children on low or, indeed, average incomes, the costs of housing and of childcare mean that they are running to stand still. I have said before in this House that in-work poverty is the great scandal of our age. Sadly, very little was announced yesterday to tackle the underlying drivers that are stifling the opportunities and aspirations of the working poor.\nInstead, we learned that the axe of the £12 billion-worth of cuts will fall most heavily on low and middle-income families. Last week the Government announced changes to the way in which child poverty is measured. Having heard yesterday’s announcements, it is not hard to understand why they did that, because the lowering of the threshold for tax credits and other changes announced yesterday will take income largely from the pockets of working parents and compound the projected increases in child poverty arising from the last round of cuts.\nAntoinette Sandbach: Housing and childcare matters are devolved to the Scottish Parliament, so does the hon. Lady agree that, if there are structural imbalances, they need to be dealt with by the Scottish Parliament?\nDr Whiteford:\nI am sure that the hon. Lady is well aware that Scotland’s childcare offer is significantly better than that enjoyed by people in other parts of the UK, and that our housing situation is not exacerbated by real rent imbalances similar to those experienced in London and the south-east of England in particular. I will pick up on that later.\nThe hon. Lady will also be aware that the Scottish block grant is calculated on the basis of the contents of the Red Book. The money currently allocated to Scotland is determined by this Chamber, so this Budget is relevant to everybody throughout the UK. It would be very wrong to ignore the fact that the purse strings are still controlled here, and that is one of the reasons why I argue for those powers to be sent up the road to Scotland, where we can use them more wisely.\nI want to return to the issue of child poverty and the paper exercises conducted to measure it. Whatever we do to massage the figures, I do not think any of us can avoid the evidence of our own eyes in our constituencies. We are seeing growth in child poverty on the ground. We see it in the rise of food banks, which have already been alluded to, and in the larger number of people coming through MPs’ doors with income-related problems. That is also being experienced by advice bureaux. We also see it in the evidence of organisations that work directly with vulnerable families and those on low incomes.\nIn my constituency, one in five children is growing up in poverty. That might come as a surprise, because we enjoy some of the lowest unemployment in the whole country. A very small percentage of people are not in work, but many thousands of people are in low-paid work, and it is those working poor who are going to be most affected by what was announced yesterday.\nMore families than ever are running to stand still, and under this Government more people are being left behind. The UK has a deeply polarised labour market, and the ability of people in low-paid work to get ahead is severely curtailed.\nJeremy Quin (Horsham) (Con): Will the hon. Lady give way?\nDr Whiteford: I will not give way at the moment.\nAmid all the rhetoric and the hyperbole of Budget day, it would have been very easy to form the impression from the media lines being trotted out yesterday that tax credits are predominantly a benefit paid to unemployed people, when in fact the opposite is the case. In Scotland, the overwhelming majority of tax credits are paid to working people. In fact, half of all families benefit from tax credits, and 95% of tax credits in Scotland are paid to families with children. We should make no mistake about where the cuts are being targeted.\nIt is inevitable that today we will consider the short-term consequences, because those cuts will put acute pressure on families, but we should be under no illusion: growing up in poverty has serious long-term consequences for children, too. It is associated with poorer educational attainment, poorer job prospects, poorer health throughout life and lower life expectancy. That is why asking families to bear the brunt of the cuts is so short-sighted. It has not only an enormous social cost, but an enormous economic cost: it holds back our economic progress and productivity, which are what we should really be focusing on and trying to improve.\nThe Government have tried to argue, today and yesterday, that the cuts will be offset by increases to the minimum wage and changes to the personal allowance, but that claim simply does not stand up to scrutiny. I think we all welcome the announcement of a long-overdue increase in the minimum wage to £7.20 an hour from next year and, indeed, the changes to national insurance, but let us not kid ourselves that rebranding the minimum wage as a living wage will actually make it a living wage.\nThere is already a living wage: it is calculated by the Living Wage Foundation and is already used by employers in the public, private and third sectors, including, I am very pleased to say, the Scottish Government. The living wage is based on the actual cost of living and it is already £7.85 an hour outside London and is due to go up again in November. We need to be absolutely clear that £7.20 is not a living wage and it will not offset the cuts in tax credits.\nThe critical point about the living wage is that it has been calculated on the basis of low-paid workers claiming their full entitlement to tax credits at the present rate, so any cut in tax credits means that the living wage will have to go up even further in order for it to provide enough for people to live on. If the Government take on board only one of the points I make today, I want it to be that one.\nGraham Evans: Does the hon. Lady want Scotland to be a high wage, low benefits, low tax economy? Does she agree with what the Government are trying to do?\nDr Whiteford: Scotland has already shown the progress we are making towards a high-skill economy. I was interested to hear yesterday’s announcement on improving the apprenticeship scheme in England. I hope the Government will aspire to do what the Scottish Government have already done. The uptake has been phenomenal and we are well on course to reaching 30,000 apprenticeships a year, which is far more proportionately per head of population than the current number in England. The Opportunities for All scheme guarantees a place in education or training for every single young person. It has been a phenomenal success, with more than 90% of our young people going into sustained employment afterwards. Instead of waiting until people have been unemployed for a year before intervening, we are intervening early so that every school leaver gets those opportunities. The approach is much more carrot than stick. The scale of the uptake shows that in Scotland we are committed to having a more successful economy and to growing it to meet the needs of our population.\nI want to return to tax credits and not be distracted from them. Today the Resolution Foundation, which has done so much to promote the living wage and highlight the issue of in-work poverty, has said that the living wage would need to be £10 an hour by 2020—not the £9 announced yesterday—to keep pace with the cost of living under the new tax and benefits regime. Let us be clear: we are not going to get out of the poverty trap with this rebranded minimum wage. We need to bring it up to the level of a living wage if we are going to take away the support currently provided through tax credits.\nThe huge cuts in tax credits will make the gap between the minimum wage and the living wage even greater and it will leave the earnings of low-paid workers even further below the actual cost of living. At present, a family with two children where both parents work and who live in a house with average rent will be below the breadline, and the changes announced yesterday will not change that. Such families will still struggle to keep their heads above water and their children will still grow up disadvantaged.\nWe need to recognise that bringing up children is expensive—for everyone, in all income groups—but children are not some sort of luxury lifestyle accessory. Having children and encouraging family life is an essential, necessary and natural part of the human life cycle. For some years, however, we have made it really difficult for younger adults to even contemplate starting a family, simply because of the pernicious combination of low pay, job insecurity and exorbitant housing costs.\nThat brings me to the differential impact of this Budget on women, because, in spite of the progress that has been made, women are still heavily concentrated in low-paid work. We are far more likely to be working part-time or in zero-hours jobs, and we are more likely to be the primary carer of children or, indeed, frail or disabled relatives. Too many women end up in low-paid, part-time work such as cashiering or cleaning simply because they can work their hours around their family responsibilities. While I welcome the increase in the personal allowance, we need to recognise that many of those women working part time in low-paid jobs will not see the full benefit of it. Indeed, the key beneficiaries are, of course, higher-rate tax payers like ourselves, and 80% of the benefit of the increase will fall in the upper half of the income spectrum.\nI have a number of questions for the Government about limiting tax credits to two children. I am not sure why they would do this—certainly in Scotland, we have a worryingly low birth rate so we should not be trying to deter people from having more children. I ask Ministers for clarification about the basis on which the number of children eligible for support through tax credits will be determined. Will it be a couple’s first two children together, or will children from a previous relationship be counted in the total? What will happen, for example, if a woman has her first child with a partner who already has two children from previous relationship or if a mother’s third child is the father’s first? As anyone who ever runs a constituency surgery will know, these are not abstract questions, and I hope Ministers will address them this afternoon.\nMaria Caulfield (Lewes) (Con): Does the hon. Lady not agree that it is absolutely right for those on benefits to make the same choices as hard-working taxpayers, including choices about how large their families should be?\nDr Whiteford: The point I am trying to make is how important it is for us to have children. If our birth rate stays as low as it is, we will be storing up long-term economic problems for ourselves. Scotland has the lowest birth rate in the UK and one of the lowest anywhere in Europe. That is precisely because people know that they have to combine their incomes even to get a starter flat. They do not have room for a baby, they do not know how they would pay for a baby if one parent had to work part time, they do not know how they would be able to continue to pay a mortgage—still less a mortgage on a bigger house—and they do not know how they would pay the rent. People have to make serious choices, but the bigger social picture is that we must absolutely encourage people to have a family and encourage family life.\nMr Duncan Smith: I will make sure that the hon. Lady’s questions are answered in the winding-up speeches, but there are all sorts of provisos involved. If two families are joined, the original child element is kept. Following up the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Lewes (Maria Caulfield), the six deciles in the middle can end up paying for others to have more children than they can afford themselves. This is a point about fairness: they are the ones paying, but they do not feel that they can afford to have more children themselves.\nDr Whiteford: The key point is that a falling birth rate is not good for anybody in whatever decile. Even those of us who do not have children are going to be dependent on the next generation being large enough to support us in our dotage when we need people to come in and look after us. The economics do not stack up. In the context of worryingly low birth-rate projections, we desperately need to encourage and make it easier for people in all deciles to decide whether having children is a possibility for them.\nI have to say that I was appalled at the reference on page 88 of the Red Book to:\n“protections for women who have a third child as the result of rape, or other exceptional circumstances.”\nI know this point was picked up yesterday, but I think the implications need to be addressed more thoroughly. It is perhaps important to acknowledge that rapes do not necessarily result in pregnancy. After all, rape is a crime that affects pre-pubescent children and post-menopausal women, as well as people of child-bearing age. How does the DWP intend to establish that a child has been born as a consequence of rape? Will there seriously be a box to tick on the form? Will a criminal conviction against a perpetrator be required?\nWe know that rape is one of the most unreported and poorly prosecuted serious crimes in the UK, with most surveys suggesting that 85% of women who are raped do not report it—for a variety of reasons, not least because most victims know their assailants and know that securing a conviction is a very long shot under our criminal justice system. Many simply do not want to put themselves through another traumatic ordeal.\nI put it to Ministers that the women most likely to become pregnant as a result of rape are those in long-term abusive relationships who are being repeatedly assaulted. They are among those least likely to report rape, and those in the most extreme danger if they do. So I ask again, what will this “protection” mean in practice? How will the DWP arbitrate? Will women be believed? What steps will be taken to preserve their dignity and privacy? I would like to hear some answers to those questions.\nAlison Thewliss (Glasgow Central) (SNP): Does my hon. Friend agree that these circumstances could stigmatise the child and run contrary to our obligations under the UN convention on the rights of the child?\nDr Whiteford: My hon. Friend raises a very pertinent point—we should not be stigmatising children whatever their parentage. This could indeed cause many problems.\nBefore I conclude, I want to address the lowering of the benefits cap. One aspect that always seems to get lost in the debate is that the main driver of the excessively high benefit payments we see in London, the south-east and a few other hotspots across the UK is excessively high private sector rents. In most cases, the claimant does not see a penny of that money; it goes straight into the pockets of the private sector landlords. This is a very serious problem, but I think the Government are tackling it from entirely the wrong angle. They need to address the chronic under-supply of affordable housing, because until they address that underlying issue, rents will continue to soar and housing—to rent or to buy—will continue to be completely unaffordable for people on low and average incomes, by which I mean people who earn normal wages doing normal jobs. Plans to force housing associations to sell their properties to tenants will only make matters worse.\nI remember that when the benefits cap was first introduced, I went to the Library to look at the impact on my own constituency. There was a grand total of three claimants affected, and two of them were people in temporary accommodation—they were in a short-term transitional situation. That was simply because our rental market was not quite so out of control as the rental market in some other parts of the UK.\nMy main concern about the new benefit cap is that it is entirely arbitrary and will mostly affect people in the private rented sector in high-rent hotspots. Fundamentally, it does not tackle the underlying problem of affordable housing supply, which is one of the main drivers of income poverty right across the UK. Instead, it seems to me that this arbitrary cap will create perverse incentives for people to move to areas or stay in areas of low economic growth where housing is more affordable but jobs are thinner on the ground. That gets us to the heart of the problem with this Budget. It puts a desperate squeeze on low and middle-income families, but there is little in the Budget to boost productivity. There is nothing to give Scotland a competitive advantage or give us a jobs boost. Instead, those who have already carried the can for the banking collapse of 2008 will stay trapped in work that does not pay.\nAusterity has been a failed policy. It has held back our economic recovery and has harmed the most disadvantaged people. That is why we need powers over our economy, our employment and our benefits system to be devolved to the Scottish Parliament, where we can use them to build a more successful and a more equitable country that is in everyone’s long-term interest.",
  "http_www_alisonthewliss_scot/https_www_alisonthewliss_scot_thewliss-condemns-uk-government-as-rwanda-bill-reaches-final-stages/content_59.html": "THEWLISS: RWANDA BILL IS A ‘TURD THAT CAN’T BE POLISHED’\nAlison Thewliss, the SNP’s Home Affairs Spokesperson, has condemned the UK Government as the Rwanda Bill reaches the final stages.\nThewliss spoke on the Rwanda Bill in the House of Commons today after a series of defeats for the UK Government forced a parliamentary showdown.\nThe Lords voted by 258 votes to 233 that the safety of Rwanda (asylum and immigration) bill has “due regard” for international and key domestic laws, including human rights and modern slavery legislation.\nLater, peers backed by 266 votes to 227 a requirement that Rwanda cannot be treated as a safe country until an independent monitoring body has verified that protections contained in the Rwanda treaty are fully implemented and remain in place.\nA short time later, in a third Government defeat, the Lords again insisted by 253 votes to 236 on an amendment to restore the jurisdiction of domestic courts in relation to the safety of Rwanda and to enable them to intervene.\nPeers also voted by 275 to 218 to press a demand for those who have worked with the UK military or government overseas, such as Afghan interpreters, to be exempted from removal.\nDespite repeated defeats in the Lords, the UK Government’s large majority means the amendments made by peers are likely to be overturned.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“The Rwanda Bill is a clear example of human trafficking. This UK Tory Government are doing all they can to try and make this plan seem like it is not, but we all know the truth.\n“As I said in the chamber today, the Rwanda Bill is a turd that can’t be polished. It is a despicable and wicked Bill being introduced as a way for the UK Government to hide from the fact they are incredibly out of their depth. It sickens me to the core that the Tories feel this is how we should treat human beings.\n“Instead of prioritising how quickly they can ship some of the most vulnerable people in the world off to Rwanda, the Tory Government should focus on creating safe and legal routes for people to seek safety here and contribute to our society, and look to support households across the UK with energy and mortgage bills.\n“With Labour and the Tories intent on punishing those seeking safety in the UK instead of helping them, it’s clear that their priorities and values do not align with Scotland’s.\n“That is why it is so important that Scotland continues to have a strong team of SNP MPs at Westminster – to make Scotland’s voice and values heard. That can only happen by voting SNP at the next general election.”",

This is a real inspiration to many young people.\n“It’s also great to see the Scottish Government doing its bit to support basketball at a grassroots level. The CashBack for communities programme recently awarded £492,800 to Basketball Scotland, allowing them to deliver 16 basketball school projects over a three-year period in some of the most deprived areas of Scotland. This speaks to the broad appeal that the sport is continuing to develop – something that I’m desperate to see continue.\n“Like many others, I’ve been extremely concerned by recent reports that basketball in the UK is facing a funding shortfall of almost £1m. With the Commonwealth Games due to start in only a matter of weeks, it’s crucial that the UK Government do the right thing to secure not only the future funding for the sport, but the places of the Scottish and England teams who have done so well to qualify”.",

The Glasgow MP said today’s “missed opportunity” was an insult to women all across the UK who were celebrating International Women’s Day.\nIn the George Osborne’s budget of July 2015 – and buried within the small print – the UK Government announced plans to restrict tax credit payments to two children per family and force women to provide evidence of exceptional circumstances, such as rape, to claim tax credits for a third child from April 2017.\nCommenting from Westminster after the Chancellor delivered his budget speech to Parliament, Ms Thewliss said:\n“Today’s budget was a real missed opportunity for Phillip Hammond and Theresa May to do the honourable thing and scrap the UK Government’s pernicious two child policy and medieval rape clause.\n“I cannot begin to describe the sheer desolation I felt when I looked at the UK Government’s Red Book today of all days – International Women’s Day – and saw that this callous Chancellor is still intending to make women prove they’ve been raped in order to receive tax credits.\n“I’ve spent over a year and a half campaigning against this appalling policy, and I still cannot believe that any Government would think it’s acceptable to put women and their families through such incredible pain and misery.\n“Although they’ve not yet laid the necessary statutory instrument before Parliament, it’s looking increasingly likely that the UK Government is planning to implement the rape clause on the April 6th.

There were also presentations from a Childline counsellor and six NSPCC Young Ambassadors.\nDame Esther spoke about how Childline is more in demand than ever before, counselling more than 300,000 children and young people every year. She also explained that since the charity introduced online support and counselling in 2009, more than two-thirds (71%) of the counselling sessions take place online.\nChildline counsellor, Michelle Turnbull, who has been volunteering for Childline for five years, gave the Peers and MPs an insight into the counselling sessions. She described the time she took a call from a young girl who was suicidal and listened and spoke to her for more than hour – they even wrote a song together. Two months later the girl called Childline back to give counsellors an update on her progress.\nMs Thewliss also got the chance to talk to children who had used Childline and understand how it changed their life.\nAlison Thewliss MP said: “It was great to be a part of these special celebrations for such an important service.

MPs heard about the action that Together for Short Lives would like the Chancellor of the Exchequer to take to help these vulnerable families when he delivers his Budget on 8 March.\nDuring the reception Ms Thewliss heard from Rachel Thompson, the mother of nine year old Frank who was diagnosed with a rare life-limiting condition when he was just four. Rachel told parliamentarians about the pressures of coordinating Frank’s 24/7 care and the support she and her family receive from their local children’s palliative care services.\nThe reception also saw the launch of the new All-Party Parliamentary Group for Children Who Need Palliative Care. The group will provide an important forum for MPs and Peers to hear about the issues facing these seriously ill children – and what action they can take in Parliament to help.\nChildren with life-limiting conditions require a wide range of professionals working together across different health and care services to support them. Unfortunately, there is a postcode lottery of support for children and their families as many cannot access the care that they need. This is because it is not available in their area or there are not enough professionals with the right skills and experience to care for them.\nAlison Thewliss MP said\n“I really appreciated having the opportunity to hear Frank’s story and to learn about the wonderful support he receives from a range of services, including his local children’s hospice.\n“It was evident at the reception that there is much more to do to help families overcome the serious challenges they face on a day to day basis. I support the charity’s call to make the mobility component of the Disability Living Allowance available to children under three who are dependent on heavy and bulky life support equipment. Currently this benefit is only available to children aged three or over.

Over half of all clubs have already responded and taken up the initiative by declaring their grounds as breastfeeding friendly. Breastfeeding in public places has been a legally protected right in Scotland since 2005, following the introduction of the Breastfeeding, etc. (Scotland) Act by Labour MSP, Elaine Smith.\nSpeaking of her campaign, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“The 2005 Breastfeeding Act specifically makes it an offence to stop a mother or child from breastfeeding in public and that is a hugely welcome protection. What gives further reassurance to breastfeeding mums is for as many places as possible to be pro-active and declare themselves “breastfeeding friendly”.\n“Football crowds have changed a lot over the years and stadiums are becoming a much more family friendly environment. The vast majority of clubs understand the need to build future generations of fans.\n“I’ve been going to Fir Park with my family and supporting Motherwell for over 20 years. Once I became a mum, I took the decision to take my son to the Europa League game against Aalesund when he was a month old. I was a bit nervous about doing so, but was very much supported by my family and neighbouring fans. I’ve had a positive experience at Scotland games too, and I would encourage all clubs to play their part.\n“By making a positive declaration that stadiums are breastfeeding friendly, this will go some way to letting people know that breastfeeding is normal and need not be a taboo issue.\n“With the exception of one or two clubs, the initial response from the majority of Scottish football clubs has been absolutely fantastic and it’s encouraging that so many folk are uniting to make Scottish football a breastfeeding friendly environment”.",

In addition, 3 million people have been displaced and 7 million Yemenis are on the brink of starvation.\nMs Thewliss’ speech focussed on the need for opening up access for humanitarian aid and food imports, which is being hampered by both parties to the conflict. She called on Ministers to secure the port of Hodeida, which has been bombarded by Saudi air strikes. On a practical level, she asked Ministers to help get cranes installed which would speed up the importing of much needed food.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“Yemen is in dire straits. Acute and severe malnutrition is resulting in innocent children dying needlessly. There have been a suspected 22,000 cholera cases in the last six months and, heartbreakingly, 63,000 children died in 2016 from preventable causes linked to malnutrition. This is a political decision; blockades by the Saudi-led coalition are preventing and delaying aid agencies from getting food into the region. Military action\n“The UK talks a good game when it comes to international aid for Yemen and it’s right to say that £85 million has been given in the last year. The UK Government is less keen to trumpet its revenue from Saudi Arms, with 143 licences granted at an eye watering value of £3.3bn. These arms are causing deaths, injuries and destruction of vital infrastructure in the port of Hodeida.\n“Yemen has been debated many times in Parliament. The time for talk is over – we need firm action now to help some of the most vulnerable people and children on the face of the planet who are seeking shelter every day from the British-made bombs being dropped on them by Saudi Arabia.\n“Without an immediate ceasefire and a political settlement, Yemen’s people will continue to be starved in a man-made and preventable famine.

Arthritis and other musculoskeletal conditions like back pain affect one in six of us.\nMusculoskeletal conditions cause pain, stiffness and fatigue that can make every day work tasks such as sitting, standing, walking, lifting, and typing difficult. They are the leading cause of workplace absence in the UK, causing 32.4 million sick days each year.\nOnly 60% of working age people with a musculoskeletal condition are in work, compared to 80% among those without a health condition or a disability.

The ability to work is something that we often take for granted, but I’ve learnt today that for those living with arthritis this can be an incredibly difficult task. Undoubtedly thousands of local people with conditions like this want to work, but do not always have the necessary support to be able to do so.\n“That’s why I’m supporting Arthritis Research UK’s ‘Work Matters to Me’ campaign, putting this vital issue on the map. The Government must ensure that there is a level playing field so that people with arthritis who are able to work have the right support and employment opportunities.”\nDr Liam O’Toole, chief executive officer at Arthritis Research UK, commented:\n“I’m delighted that Alison Thewliss MP is supporting our campaign to give people with arthritis the freedom from their condition in employment, enabling them to live their life to the full.\n“The current situation for people living with the daily pain of arthritis is untenable. Arthritis and musculoskeletal conditions such as back pain are the number one cause for workplace sickness absence in the UK.\n“Our retirement age has increased and we’re an ageing working population, so even more people are going to be living with the pain and unpredictability of arthritis, and face an uncertain working future.\n“But with the right kind of support and job; work can benefit your mental and physical health as well as financial position.\n“We need to see Government action to address the employment needs of people with long term conditions such as arthritis, so that they have the right support and opportunity to maintain their freedom and quality of life.”",

It’s a dramatic statement, and it’s one that has raised many questions – so perhaps it’s best to go back to the start.\nHidden away on page 88 of Chancellor George Osborne’s Budget in July was a small, almost innocuous sentence, which related to the Government’s plan to restrict the child element of tax credits and Universal Credit – child benefit, essentially – to the first two children:\n“The Department of Work and Pensions and HMRC will develop protections for women who have a third child as a result of rape, or other exceptional circumstances”.\nI read the sentence again. I re-read it. I showed it to the colleague sitting next to me. What did this actually mean? How would DWP and HMRC prove that a child was borne of rape?\nThe more I thought about this, the more furious I became. Rape is a very serious crime, but yet one of the most under-reported and under-convicted crimes there is. It exists in abusive relationships, it exists in marriage. For many women, is traumatic beyond description, and it is something they feel is shameful.\nHow vile that this Government would consider putting a woman, who may already feel extremely vulnerable, in the position where she had to confess to an Government official that her child had been born as a result of rape. How stigmatising, for that woman, for that child and for the family. Piling humiliation on top of pain is not the essence of “protection”.\nI’ve raised this with Ministers at every level of Government, including the Prime Minister himself.\nFor all the questions my colleagues and I have asked since the July budget, there has yet to be an answer as to how this will work, and particularly the burden of proof.\nThe DWP and HMRC are not known for being organisations that will take you at your word; the casework I have seen in my office gives me no confidence in either the competence or the sensitivity of these departments. What hope does a woman in such vulnerable circumstances have? Will they accept her word, or will only a criminal conviction do? We don’t yet know.\nHowever, the real problem at the heart of this is not even the rape clause; it’s the two child policy.\nFor me, it’s tantamount to social engineering. It makes children a financial commodity. It passes judgement and stigmatises.\nIt doesn’t respect the disproportionate impact on those of particular faiths or backgrounds where larger families are the norm. It’s also economic madness, as we need more children to counter our ageing population. And it runs counter to our Government’s obligations to treat children equally under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.\nThe two child policy has not yet been fully explained or justified by this Government, other than in the most tabloid of terms. I’ve heard some suggest in carelessly callous language that you should only have the children you can afford. It does not take account of the fact that you may well be able to “afford” three children when you had them, but not if your circumstances change: what if your partner dies, if you become disabled, if your marriage breaks up?\nWhat happens in the case where families come together with existing children from previous relationships?\nThe Budget claimed multiple births would be protected, but not at which stage; if your first two children are twins, will the third still be eligible, or only if that happens the other way around?\nThese questions and more have been asked by MPs since July, but answers have not been forthcoming.\nThe campaign to scrap the rape clause is gathering pace and many people are already signing the petition, which had almost 6,000 names at the last count.

Scotland takes pride in being a country that is open to refugees, but this new bill would make this all but impossible.\n“Constituents all across Glasgow Central have contacted me to show their anger towards the bill, yet this Tory Government seem to care only about their narrow ideology rather than the views of refugees, asylum seekers, and those who wish to welcome them.\n“I am proud to be amongst those who opposed this cruel bill and share my thanks to those constituents who wrote to me about it – not one was in support of the Nationality and Borders Bill.\n“Refugees in this country should be welcome – not shut out.

In particular, there are big, important conversations to be had about how to manage a deceased loved one’s affairs and how to prepare for the end of life.\nI met with representatives of SunLife to talk about planning for death and they presented some shocking figures to me from their Cost of Dying 2015 report:\n- 41% of those surveyed had not made adequate financial arrangements to cover the costs of a funeral.\n- 31% of those surveyed did not know if their loved ones would prefer burial or cremation.\n- One in six of those surveyed had not made funeral plans solely because they felt uncomfortable discussing death.\nFailing to prepare for death can put people in serious financial difficulty at an emotionally challenging time and I urge my constituents to use resources available to them to start conversations with their loved ones about death and make adequate arrangements which reflect their loved ones’ wishes. One resource that is available is My Perfect Send Off, produced by SunLife, which asks some simple questions about funeral preferences. The tool offers people the opportunity to record and share their final wishes with loved ones in a sensitive way, either by securely recording your wishes in a document which you can either discuss with loved ones or keep locked away in preparation for the future.\nI hope that this tool can be used to start the difficult conversations that people need to have about death so that they can be fully prepared for when the time comes.",

The plan to restrict child tax credits to two children for new claimants is due to commence in 2017.\nSNP MP Alison Thewliss first identified the issue in July 2015 during the Government’s summer budget.\nCommenting as she launched the latest stage of the campaign in Glasgow City Centre, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“We think the policy on limiting tax credits to the first two children is appalling and tantamount to social engineering, but to put a woman who has been raped in a position where she needs to declare that to a government official is just abhorrent. This also stigmatises the child involved, which is surely against the UN convention on the rights of the child.

In total, more than half a million people are currently on the Anthony Nolan register and the average per constituency is 905.\nNow Alison Thewliss is encouraging more 16 to 30-year-olds to sign up. She says it is particularly important that young men and people from ethnic minorities join the register as they are currently under-represented.\nThe blood cancer charity Anthony Nolan created the world’s first stem cell donor register, and has been saving lives for over four decades by matching remarkable people willing to donate their bone marrow or stem cells to patients in desperate need of a transplant. It also carries out pioneering research to increase stem cell transplant success, and supports patients through their transplant journeys.\nTwo thirds of UK patients will not find a matching donor from within their families; instead they turn to Anthony Nolan to find them an unrelated donor.\nAnthony Nolan wants to give people the very best chance of life by finding the best possible match for them. But the charity can currently only find a perfect match for 60 per cent of transplant recipients, so they still urgently need more people to come forward.\nMs Thewliss said:\n“I am delighted that 1379 people in Glasgow Central constituency are registered on the Anthony Nolan stem cell register. It is fantastic to see that there are so many heroic and selfless people in my constituency.\n“I hope that more local people will also now be inspired to sign up and to become potential lifesavers for people in desperate need.”\nAnn O’Leary, Head of Register Development at Anthony Nolan, said:\n‘We are delighted that Alison Thewliss has been inspired to encourage others to sign up as donors. Donating is an incredibly selfless thing to do and will give someone with blood cancer the best possible chance of survival. What many people don’t realise is that it is also surprisingly simple.’\nTo join the Anthony Nolan register you must be 16-30 and in good health. It involves filling out a simple online form and spitting into a tube. About 90% of people who are asked to donate will do so through a process similar to giving blood.\nThe charity needs supporters of all ages to champion the register at a local level and help us spread the word – from schools, communities and workplaces to your own friends and family.

A majority of those affected travelled to the UK under the now obsolete Tier 1 (General) route; many are skilled professionals and others business owners.\nIn May, the Home Secretary, Sajid Javid, wrote to the Home Affairs Select Committee detailing that all applications falling for refusal under the character and conduct guidance of the Immigration Rules would be put on hold pending the findings of an internal review. Evidence from the Highly Skilled Migrants campaign group suggests however that decisions are still being made.\nCommenting following the debate, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“The response from the Minister today fell way short of what was required, and will give little hope to the many hundreds of people across the UK who are left with the unenviable task of trying to clear their names and rebuild their lives in light of this Home Office malevolence. I am utterly appalled by the Minister’s lack of compassion and knowledge of this issue.\n“It’s blatantly clear to me, and to scores of other MPs, lawyers and campaigners that the Home Office has made a calculated decision to pursue people in this way, using 322(5) rules in an attempt to legitimise their actions. Policies like this have no place in modern society. Indeed, this scandal is akin to Windrush part two.\n“What is particularly striking about the actions of the Home Office is that they seem to be out of step with other government departments. HMRC, for example, have said in a number of cases that individuals who have corrected their tax information have done the right thing. Similarly, a Treasury Minister confirmed recently that they would encourage people to continue to correct their returns as and when they notice an error.\n“It is incumbent on the UK Government to get their house in order here. The immigration system is clearly broken, and it’s innocent people like those we heard about in the debate who are bearing the brunt. I urge the Home Office to act now, and retract this vile policy”.\nThe letter from the Home Secretary to the Chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee can be accessed here – https://tinyurl.com/y9kxtgpg",

Since 2002, a person waiting for their asylum claim to be decided has been prohibited from working. As asylum seekers cannot lawfully work, they often have to rely on Government or charitable support to live.\nLeading a Westminster parliamentary debate, SNP MP Alison Thewliss, will call for the changes to UK immigration rules. This follows the publication of a working paper by Warwick University last month, which shows that allowing asylum seekers to work could save tens of millions of pounds for the UK Government.\nThewliss will also use the debate to speak about asylum cases she has dealt with in her capacity as the MP for Glasgow Central. Her calls for changes in immigration policy today are supported by a coalition of charities and campaigning groups.\nSpeaking in advance of today’s Westminster debate, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“For far too long, under successive Governments, asylum seekers have too often been viewed with scepticism and treated with contempt. Today’s debate is a real opportunity to refocus and remember the origins of the word asylum – that is the protection granted by a state to someone who has left their home country as a political refugee.\n“The increasingly poor treatment of asylum seekers and the removal of the most basic rights is nothing short of degrading and simply adds further misery to those who have fled persecution, war, famine and sexual violence.\n“I know from speaking to some of the asylum seeking constituents I represent that life is made ever more difficult due to the draconian restrictions placed upon them by the UK Government. These restrictions range from the threat of detention, regular and unsettling signing sessions at the Home Office, right through to the ban on working.\n“We know that permitting asylum seekers to work would allow them to integrate better into society, develop their English and make friends in what can often be a lonely and new environment. Many are professionals with skills they would love to put to use. This powerful working paper from Warwick University also sets out the significant savings that the Government could make if it made a fairly modest change to the immigration rules.\n“Another issue I plan to raise in today’s debate relates to the punitive rules the Government has around volunteering and unpaid work.\n“Currently, the Government views certain cases of volunteering as being a sign of ‘bad character’. This fallacy in policy is exemplified by a Christian Pastor in my constituency who was given leave to remain in the UK, and was seeking full British citizenship. However, he was denied that because he did voluntary work for the British Red Cross. This is absolutely ludicrous and I’ll be looking for answers on this from Ministers today.”",

This is pivotal as:\n- Every year in the UK approximately 7,300 women are diagnosed with ovarian cancer and sadly 4,200 women lose their fight – that’s 11 women every day.\n- Ovarian cancer is the sixth most common cause of cancer death in women and accounts for more UK deaths than all of the other gynaecological cancers put together.\n- Most women are not diagnosed until ovarian cancer has spread, which is why it is important that women know about the symptoms, so that they can seek advice as early as possible.\nAs part of the month-long campaign Make Time for Tea, the charity is encouraging people to hold a tea party where they raise awareness and funds for ovarian cancer. This campaign will raise vital funds for pioneering research into early detection and prevention.\nAlison Thewliss said:\n“I’m proud to be supporting The Eve Appeal throughout March to raise much-needed awareness of the little-known and little-talked about condition of ovarian cancer. It’s vital that we continue to raise awareness of and funds into ovarian cancer research in order to achieve earlier detection and prevention of this cancer before it even begins. I’d ask all my local constituents to look out for the key signs and symptoms of ovarian cancer and do what they can to support The Eve Appeal this March for Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month.”\nAthena Lamnisos, Chief Executive of The Eve Appeal said:\n“The biggest piece of mis-information out there is that ovarian cancer is a symptomless, ‘silent’ disease. Ovarian cancer isn’t silent. There needs to be much greater awareness of the symptoms.\n“Survival rates are low, few treatments available and few newer ones in the pipeline. What we often hear about is that diagnosis comes late – either because a woman hasn’t recognised the symptoms, or because her GP didn’t. This is something that must change.”\nThere are four main ovarian cancer symptoms:\n• increased abdominal size and persistent bloating (not bloating that comes and goes)\n• Persistent pelvic and abdominal pain\n• Unexplained change in bowel habits\n• Difficulty eating and feeling full quickly, or feeling nauseous\nThe charity advises local women to always follow the ‘rule of three’. If you’ve had symptoms for three weeks or more, then visit your GP. If you’ve had to see your GP on more than three occasions for these symptoms, and haven’t been referred to a specialist, ask for a referral.\nIf you have any worries or questions about the signs and symptoms of any of the gynaecological cancers, contact The Eve Appeal’s nurse information service Ask Eve for free, confidential information: nurse@eveappeal.org.uk.",

My experience of dealing with these constituents strengthens my view that the current sanctions regime is unfit for purpose and that it should be halted and reviewed.\nThis afternoon. I took the opportunity to highlight some of the awful situations that some of my constituents have been placed in as a result of the benefit sanctions regime in a Westminster Hall debate. One constituent on Employment Support Allowance, who was suffering from severe depression, was sanctioned for failing to attend a work-related interview, despite his condition making him too ill to attend the interview. Another constituent lost their Jobseeker’s Allowance for over a year after failing to attend an adviser interview – the constituent was not given written notification of the sanction and was not given details of appeal.\nHowever, the most ludicrous example of the failings of the sanctions regime is my constituent on Universal Credit who, having received a form offer of employment, was still expected to adhere to the Claimant Commitment even though he was due to start employment in the next few weeks. This case was featured in today’s edition of The National. This represents the ultimate failing of the DWP’s regime – people who are actually in work are potentially subject to sanction. I will continue to campaign for the existing sanctions regime to be halted and for a full independent review into sanctions to take place without delay.\nChristmas Post!\nChristmas is a busy time of year, not least for Royal Mail who have to handle a much larger volume of parcels and letters.

This is not a debate about breastfeeding versus formula milk.\n“I believe it is vitally important that parents get accurate and impartial information on the contents of formula milk and the best way to prepare it safely. At present there is a worrying lack of independent scrutiny of infant and young child formula, as well as growing frustration about the industry marketing tricks and misleading claims being pushed on parents and health professionals alike.\n“Misinformation on health policy never ends well and this Bill aims to seriously tighten up the behaviour of the formula industry.\n“I look forward to using the coming months to consult on the contents of the Bill. I will continue working with MPs across the House to convince the Government that this should be put on the statute books to safeguard the health and wellbeing of babies and young children.”\nAnything that helps! It’s a (small) step in the right direction!\nKey is education on the facts to allow parents to make an informed choice, and up to date training for nhs staff..\nFantastic Alison! Here’s hoping, this is do badly needed\nThank you so much for tackling this thorny issue and for making it clear that this is not a breatmilk versus formula milk debate but it is about distinctly dodgey marketing claims. The tactics of formula milk companies are shameful and getting more sophisticated. How can parents make informed decisions when faced with a barrage of overblow claims and misinformation? Your work on this Bill is vital, I do hope you will be successful.\nHow wonderful",

There were also presentations from a Childline counsellor and six NSPCC Young Ambassadors.\nDame Esther spoke about how Childline is more in demand than ever before, counselling more than 300,000 children and young people every year. She also explained that since the charity introduced online support and counselling in 2009, more than two-thirds (71%) of the counselling sessions take place online.\nChildline counsellor, Michelle Turnbull, who has been volunteering for Childline for five years, gave the Peers and MPs an insight into the counselling sessions. She described the time she took a call from a young girl who was suicidal and listened and spoke to her for more than hour – they even wrote a song together. Two months later the girl called Childline back to give counsellors an update on her progress.\nMs Thewliss also got the chance to talk to children who had used Childline and understand how it changed their life.\nAlison Thewliss MP said: “It was great to be a part of these special celebrations for such an important service. Childline provide an excellent service in supporting young people of all ages on a daily basis and I want to thank them for the work they do in supporting my young constituents.”\nPeter Wanless, CEO of the NSPCC said: “This event at Westminster was a great way to continue Childline’s 30th birthday celebrations, with Dame Esther Rantzen as always leading the way. It was particularly moving hearing from the Childline counsellor and how she helps children and young people on a daily basis, some of whom find themselves in the most desperate of circumstances.”\nDuring Childline’s birthday week the NSPCC released new data that reveals a 35% rise in anxiety in the past year, with 11,706 children and young people being counselled by Childline in 2015/16 compared to 8,642 in 2014/15. An increasing number of children and young people are being struck down by the problem, with causes ranging from personal and family issues to concerns about world affairs such as the EU Referendum, the US Election and troubles in the Middle East.\nThe charity has also announced Cheryl as their new Childline campaigner.",
  "http_www_alisonthewliss_scot/https_www_alisonthewliss_scot_page_18/content_768.html": "SNP MP, Alison Thewliss, has hit out at new data which suggests that the Government is failing miserably to get a grip on tackling low and exploitative pay.\nCommenting following the publication of answers to a series of written parliamentary questions she tabled, the Glasgow MP said Prime Minister Theresa May’s apparent desire to tackle the “burning injustices” in society, as well as efforts to support the “just about managing”, was nothing more than empty rhetoric.\nSeizing on data released to her by Treasury and Cabinet Office Ministers, Ms Thewliss said this wasn’t the first time she had raised the issue, having requested similar data from Government officials last year. Following that, she wrote a scathing letter to the former Prime Minister David Cameron, urging him to make tackling low pay a priority.\nCommenting, Glasgow Central SNP MP Alison Thewliss said:\n“Last summer might have seen a change of occupant in 10 Downing Street but it appears to be business as usual for this Tory Government; they appear to have no interest whatsoever in tackling pay inequality and exploitation. Theresa May’s impassioned speech on the steps of Downing Street has been exposed again and again as empty rhetoric.\n“Disappointingly, when I obtained last year’s data from the Government, over 100,000 Scots were still being paid below the national minimum wage. This is in stark contrast to the Scottish Government, and huge swathes of Scotland’s public services, who pay the real living wage of £8.45 per hour.\n“House of Commons Library figures reveal that for 2015-16 alone 950 employers have been found by HMRC not to be paying the minimum wage. Over the past decade only 13 prosecutions have taken place for non-compliance, which simply beggars belief.\n“These shocking figures also show that the Government is doing very little to crack down on employers who aren’t complying with National Minimum Wage legislation passed almost two decades ago. Indeed, the Minister’s response reveals the Government don’t think it’s worth prosecuting companies for non-compliance. This sends an incredibly worrying signal to exploitative employers who will think it is perfectly acceptable to pay peanuts for a fair day’s work.\n“If Theresa May is truly serious about supporting the “just about managing” in society, she needs to implement an urgent action plan.\n“The Prime Minister should start by cracking down heavily on exploitative employers who are flouting minimum wage laws. Companies won’t take this matter seriously if all they can expect is a rap on the knuckles.\n“Theresa May should implement a real living wage, as set by the Living Wage Foundation, rather than the pale imitation being punted by her Chancellor. The real Living Wage is being successfully promoted by the Scottish Government, with Scottish Canals being announced just this week as the 700th employer in Scotland to sign up.\n“Thirdly, and as part of an action plan, we need to have genuine pay equality – not just for women but for young people as well. Currently, the UK Government has a ridiculous system whereby minimum wage rates are set in accordance with age. That means if you’re a sixteen year old apprentice, the law says you can be paid as little as £3.40 per hour. How does that fit into the Prime Minister’s new obsession about a shared society?\n“I’ve written to the Prime Minister setting out three very simple and practical steps she could take to tackle this – I hope sincerely I won’t be sending the same action plan next year when I request these figures from the Government again”.",
  "http_www_alisonthewliss_scot/http_www_alisonthewliss_scot_rubbish-response-from-uk-government-on-post-brexit-waste-and-recycling-policy/content_389.html": "Two SNP MPs have criticised the UK Government’s lackadaisical attitude towards waste and recycling policy, as the UK today formally started the process of leaving the European Union.\nSNP duo, Alison Thewliss and Calum Kerr have rounded on Tory Ministers, following a letter from Secretary of State, Sajid Javid. They say the Government was left “floundering” to explain which policies UK Councils will be expected to implement regarding waste and recycling after Britain leaves the EU.\nSNP Local Government spokesperson, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“All 400 Councils across these islands have been working hard over many years to reduce waste and ensure that we send as little as possible to landfill. This has been good for our environment, and has transformed the way we deal with our resources. Our current EU membership provides local councils with clear guidance when it comes to important waste and recycling policies, yet all of this could soon be thrown on the Great Repeal Bill bonfire.\n“Not for the first time, the rubbish response from the Secretary of State shows that this Government is absolutely floundering when it comes to the real detail of Brexit. Ministers obviously don’t have a clue what Councils will be asked to do, which has an impact on the decisions local authorities are making now about future investment in waste and recycling services.\n“At the moment, the UK generates over 200 million tonnes of waste every year and we need to be doing more – much more – to reduce that figure if we’re to leave a better environment for the generations to come after us. Local authorities need more detail so they can plan for the future, not the usual recycled Brexit soundbites from the UK Government.\nThe SNP’s spokesperson on Environment, Food & Rural Affairs, Calum Kerr MP said:\n“Across all departments and at all levels of government, Brexit is sowing confusion. We recently learned from DEFRA that their long awaited 25 year plan for the environment has been shelved until after the UK leaves the EU. Yet a long-term strategic vision on environmental issues is more vital than ever.\n“The EU has led the way in promoting the circular economy and setting ambitious waste reduction targets. This isn’t just red-tape: we know that prior to joining the ECC, Britain was known as the “dirty man of Europe”; there can be no return to that state of affairs.\n“The refusal of the UK government to offer clarity and reassurance on the question of waste and recycling is yet another indication that it is prepared to pursue a reckless Brexit at any cost, with no plan for what comes next.”",

The Prime Minister advanced that the UK Government has taken care to ensure the issue is dealt with sensitively, with Blackford countering that the clause is a disgrace.\nThe rape clause, or non-consensual sex exemption, has been in place for over a year, and forms part of the government’s wider policy to restrict Tax Credits and Universal Credit (child element) claims to the first two children in a family.\nEarlier this week, McVey defended the government’s record on welfare reform during an evidence hearing of the Social Security Committee at Holyrood.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“It really is repugnant to see the Prime Minister leaping to the Secretary of State’s defence on the issue of the rape clause.\n“Earlier this week Esther McVey described this vile policy as “extra help”, “an opportunity to talk” and “double support”. It is none of these things. By supporting it, the Prime Minister and her government are complicit in putting vulnerable women in harm’s way.\n“Experts in violence against women recognise that forced disclosure of abuse brings a significant risk of reliving that trauma. This should always be at a time of a woman’s choosing, not at the point where she has to make a choice about putting food on the table to feed her children.\n“Any defence of the two child limit and rape clause is truly reprehensible. The entire policy is ill-judged, cruel, and has nothing to do with supporting women. It must be scrapped.\n“I hope the Secretary of State will reflect on her words, and respond to my request for an urgent meeting without delay”.",

With the interactive game, Guide Dogs Scotland raised awareness of their Streets Ahead campaign to keep streets free from clutter.\nStreet clutter, such as pavement parked cars, shop advertising boards and wheelie bins, is a real blight on the streetscape and a major problem for pedestrians. It is particularly dangerous for people with visual impairments, parents with pushchairs, wheelchair users and other disabled people.\nAccording to a Guide Dogs survey, 98% of people with a vision impairment in Scotland encountered obstacles on the pavement and 88% of them have had problems with pavement parked cars specifically. Guide Dogs Scotland campaigns against problem pavement parking to make sure that blind and partially sighted people can get out and about independently.\nAlison Thewliss MP commented:\n“Our streets must be accessible to all our citizens and I am delighted to give my support to Guide Dogs Scotland in their campaign to tackle street clutter. The SNP in government have already taken action to tackle the most common obstacles facing blind and visually impaired people – including significant changes to the commercial bin arrangements in Glasgow which will see a reduction in the visibility of large commercial bins, thereby reducing clutter and making the city’s streets more attractive for everyone.\n“I regularly receive complaints from my constituents about inconsiderate parking and I am hopeful that the SNP Scottish Government will adopt the proposals put forward by my colleague Sandra White MSP to ban unsafe pavement parking, thereby making the streets safer for all but especially those who are blind and visually impaired and rely on clear, obstacle-free pavements to navigate through everyday life.”\nNiall Foley, Engagement Manager at Guide Dogs Scotland, commented:\n“It is terrifying for someone who cannot see oncoming traffic or has small children with them to take the risk of stepping out into a road because of cars parked on the pavement. Everyone should be able to walk the streets without fear.\n“We welcome Transport Scotland’s work on a law to curb unsafe pavement parking and are looking forward to seeing a prohibition of unsafe pavement parking as part of the Transport Bill in the near future.”",

Marches also took place at five other locations across the country.\nA UK Government-commissioned survey published in 2015 concluded that around 11% of women, having left their job as a result of giving birth, had reported being a victim of workplace discrimination. According to the Equality and Human Rights Commission, if these results were replicated across the country, the cumulative effect would be around 54,000 women being forced out of work each year.\nThe ‘March of the Mummies’ campaign is lobbying the UK Government to increase the time limit for raising a tribunal claim from three months to at least six, and reports that there has been a sharp decline in women employees bringing tribunal claims against their employers since fees for doing so were increased substantially in 2013.\nAlison Thewliss MP said:\n“I pay credit to all who joined in today’s ‘March of the Mummies’ campaign, and to the wider work of the group, Pregnant Then Screwed.\n“Every year thousands of women face the prospect of losing their jobs as a result of pregnancy. This is bad enough, but the fact that the same women then face a serious struggle in accessing justice is simply unacceptable.\n“Some of the stories that I have heard first-hand from women have been truly shocking, and have ranged from women having their work-patterns changed without their knowledge, to those finding out at short-notice that there is simply no job for them to return to once their maternity has ended.\n“It’s encouraging to see the Scottish Government taking steps to tackle pregnancy and maternity discrimination in the workplace, and opening up a formal dialogue with women through the establishment of a working group. However, employment law still resides at Westminster and much more must be done by the UK Government to protect women’s rights. If they won’t, these powers must be devolved to Holyrood.”",

They have been unable to explain how this will work, or how it fits with equalities legislation and the “family test”.

When I pressed the Minister, it turns out that the Government have consulted just four organisations on a policy which will cause unimaginable pain and distress to victims of rape.\n“This Government clearly does not appreciate that the majority of rapes happen within abusive relationships, and that pushing women to claim could place them and their children in a very dangerous position.

It follows months of consideration, research and scrutiny of the proposal by the Alcohol & Drug Partnership.\nGlasgow MP, Ms Thewliss, travelled to Dublin last month to meet with officials, politicians and the Ana Liffey drug project to learn more about SIFs and how they operate. The Irish Government has already announced plans for its first safe injecting facility to open early next year.\nSpeaking after today’s decision was taken, Ms Thewliss said:\n“The issues of discarded needles, the increase in infection rates and drug overdoses are not things people find easy to talk about. It is an uncomfortable subject and for too long it’s been an issue swept under the carpet. We cannot ignore this any longer.\n“The sad fact remains that this city has a public drug injecting population of approximately five hundred people, who are extremely vulnerable. I’ve seen with my own eyes people injecting in broad day light near to my office at Glasgow Cross. Dirty needles are regularly being discarded and it’s becoming a major public health risk, not only for the Council staff clearing them away but for local people finding syringes in their closes and near their homes.\n“As well as fearing for the safety of the drug injecting population, I am deeply concerned that members of the public could be injured by a discarded syringe.\n“I’ve been elected now for almost a decade and can see that this is an issue which is not going away. I’ve considered this very seriously, I can really see no other option but to move towards a supervised and safe injecting facility.\n“Research has shown that safe injecting facilities save lives, move drug injecting off the street and open up a vital dialogue between services and drug users. Safe injecting facilities can rapidly reduce the rate of deaths from overdose which must be at the forefront of our minds.\n“We need to ask ourselves a very difficult question. If someone I cared about was injecting drugs, where would I want them to be? Would I want them to be on dirty waste ground, in a dark city centre lane or a back court all alone, or supervised in the safety of a consumption room with trained medical staff available and services to help move them away from drugs in the longer term?\n“I welcome this very carefully considered step by the Integration Joint Board, believe it will improve public safety, and hope it is a first step to supporting this vulnerable population towards recovery.”\nWell done on this it really is the way forward. Glasgow will have less HIV contractions at a time when they have risen by 400% in the last year. Their will be less deaths, less crime and most importantly addicts will come into contact with treatment services they may not have in the past.",

She needs regular assistance to manage her condition, which currently qualifies her for Disability Living Allowance but not for Personal Independence Payment. She stands to lose £110 a week as a result of the UK Government’s planned transition from DLA to PIP.\nIn March 2017, the UK Government brought in a change to the eligibility criteria to Personal Independence Payment, in light of a tribunal rulings which stated that people who required supervision to take medication for a long-term health condition should be awarded more points in the PIP assessment.\nThe change is estimated to deny at least 2,000 people with long-term mental health conditions access to Personal Independence Payment, according to figures provided by the DWP’s own Equality Impact Assessment – around 1.2% of the total number of people who claim PIP.\nMs Thewliss has written to the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions to ask for an urgent review of the PIP criteria, to ensure that people who require long-term monitoring of medical conditions can continue to receive the support they need.\nSpeaking after Prime Minister’s Questions, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“The denial of PIP to my constituent demonstrates the real human cost of the Tories’ callous austerity agenda. My constituent, and many like her, have been placed in a very difficult position because of the Tories’ obsession with cutting social security for some of the most vulnerable people in society.\n“When changes to the PIP criteria were introduced in March 2017, the Government’s own assessments indicated that a small, specific group of people with long-term mental health conditions would lose out on crucial financial support. The Government ignored the warnings given and decided to press ahead with targeting some of the most vulnerable people in society.\n“The Prime Minister’s promises of radical action on mental health are ringing hollow today.

A UK Minister is also required to respond to the MPs on behalf of the Government.\nSpeaking in advance of next week’s Westminster Hall debate, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“I’ve been a great supporter of breastfeeding since having my son five years ago. I know how difficult it can be, and wanted to take this opportunity both to highlight the benefits of breastfeeding and what role wider society can play in raising awareness.\n“Evidence tells us that breastfed infants are likely to have a reduced risk of infection, particularly those affecting the ear, respiratory tract and gastro-intestinal tract. This protective effect is particularly marked in low birth weight infants.\n“Other probable benefits include improved cognitive and psychological development, and a reduced risk of childhood obesity. There is also evidence that women who breastfed have lower risks of breast cancer, epithelial ovarian cancer and hip fracture later in life.\n“I am looking forward to next week’s debate which I hope to be constructive and will allow me to push this important issue further up the agenda.”",

Ms Thewliss was one of many MPs joining WWF in London this week to show they care about the future of our planet, ahead of the global lights out event, due to take place on Saturday 19 March at 8:30pm.\nMPs are celebrating Earth Hour to send a message that they care about the natural world and help inspire their constituents to go beyond the hour to build a sustainable future for both people and the planet.\nMs Thewliss said: “Our natural world is precious to all life that inhabits it, but we need to do more to protect it. WWF’s Earth Hour reminds us that there are simple things we can all do for the planet, not for just one hour, but every day. It’s a great opportunity to bring together millions of people from across the world with one united goal – to help protect our planet. That’s why this Earth Hour I’m showing I care about the future of our planet by making a special pledge for a low carbon future.”\nEvery year Earth Hour inspires millions of people around the world to come together and switch off their lights for one hour in a symbolic act to show they care about our brilliant planet. WWF already works to tackle a lot of environmental challenges – like deforestation, threats to endangered species, and the impacts of climate change – but Earth Hour is a chance for everyone to say they’ll do their bit to help create a sustainable future. It reminds us that together we have the power to make change happen.\nLast year a record-breaking 172 countries and some of the world’s most famous buildings including Big Ben, Hong Kong’s skyline and the Sydney Harbour Bridge joined the global celebration. In the UK alone, over 10 million people took part, along with over 4,800 schools, 200 landmarks and thousands of businesses and organisations.\nJennifer Clements, spokesperson for WWF’s Earth Hour, said: “We’re thrilled that MPs have given their support to this year’s Earth Hour and we hope they will inspire many others to get involved. By taking one simple step to switch off your lights at 8.30pm on 19 March, Earth Hour is a chance for all of us to come together and send out a global message about protecting our planet.”\nEveryone can join the celebration for WWF’s Earth Hour on Saturday 19 March 2016.

There are approximately 500 people actively injecting drugs in Glasgow city centre, and recent reports describe the unprecedented HIV outbreak in the city as out of control. What’s more, I am greatly concerned for the safety of my constituents as a result of needles left in bin sheds, closes and back lanes.\n“Recent debates in the Scottish Parliament and Glasgow City Council have demonstrated a clear desire for the introduction of a safe drug consumption facility, with support from all parties, including members of the Conservative Party. My Bill will take new steps to enable drug addiction to be treated as a public health issue, whilst ensuring that criminal activity from illegal drugs continues to be robustly tackled by the police.\n“People are dying on the streets of my constituency, and the risk to the general public from discarded needles and transmission of blood-borne diseases is very real. The only remaining barrier to doing something different is the Home Office’s unwillingness to grant an exemption.\n“Perhaps if the Home Secretary visited my constituency, and witnessed the perilousness of the situation for her herself, she could be more easily persuaded. Others, it seems, are already convinced.”",

Statistics from the IET’s Skills and Demand in Industry survey showed that women represent only 9% of the engineering workforce in the UK*.\n#9PercentIsNotEnough has been encouraging engineers to share a picture with their hand raised to the fact that only 9% of women make up the UK’s engineering and technology workforce – and to highlight that engineering is a realistic and inspiring career for girls.\nPresident of the Institution of Engineering and Technology, Jeremy Watson CBE, said: “Women are woefully underrepresented in engineering. In a profession with a serious skills shortage, this represents a problem for the economy as well as for diversity.\n“So to coincide with International Women’s Day, we want to make it clear that engineering is a fantastic career for women. Not only that – but there are thousands of female engineers doing amazing things that are changing our world.\n“The Young Woman Engineer of the Year Awards celebrate our best female engineering talent and finds those all-important engineering role models to inspire more girls – and boys – to go into engineering. We’re very grateful for Alison Thewliss MP’s support for our campaign.”\nCurrent IET Young Woman Engineer of the Year, Jenni Sidey, added:\n“The IET’s efforts in diversity in the field are not just good for the profession but a necessity for the UK to be a competitive innovator and global technological leader.”\nThe deadline for entry to the IET Young Woman Engineer of the Year Awards is 7 July 2017.

Universities are already facing challenges in attracting international students due to the removal of the post-study work visa, and students are choosing to go instead to countries which make them make them more welcome.\n“UK Government moves to further restrict international students will only serve to undermine the efforts of universities. This comes as yet a further blow to universities which are already set to lose crucial Horizon 2020 funding.\n“The UK’s decision to leave the European Union in June – despite Scotland voting overwhelmingly to remain – has already caused concern for EU nationals currently studying in Scotland.

Responses in this category have increased significantly since April 2016.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“Examining these figures from the Trussell Trust, it is now undeniable that there is a link between government welfare reform policies and increased foodbank use.\n“It is utterly appalling that in today’s society, people must rely on food parcels due to not having enough to live on. The report speaks to the fact that the basic costs of food, housing and utility bills continue to rise, and benefits are failing to keep pace.\n“The number of foodbank referrals as a result of a reduction in benefit, or due to delays when moving to a new benefit such as Universal Credit, have seen a dramatic upturn. Similarly, the Trussell Trust commented that foodbank projects in Universal Credit rollout areas have experienced an average increase of 52% in the preceding 12 months, with many citing issues when transitioning to the new benefit.\n“We already know about the squeeze being put on families as a result of the benefit cap, and the damaging consequences of the two-child limit and rape clause, now there is real and demonstrable evidence elucidating a clear link between changes to welfare and increased use of foodbanks.\n“It is incumbent on Ministers not to ignore the burden of evidence that has been presented on increasedfoodbank use.

There are serious questions of transparency and how the Home Office can ever be held to account for what happens to the individuals it sends to Rwanda. But this is just another example of the Government abandoning its responsibility to offer sanctuary and support to those fleeing persecution.\n“My recent visit to Napier Barracks allowed me to see first-hand how profoundly unsuitable and dehumanising such sites are for asylum seekers. The dilapidated former barracks used by the Government to house asylum seekers are inadequate, lacking in facilities and people there struggle to get access to lawyers and adequate healthcare. It is frightening to imagine what a facility located in another country thousands of miles away from scrutiny will be like.\n“I would have hoped that the Tory Government would learn from the comments made after our visit. Yet despite the warnings given to them about the conditions in Napier, the government is proceeding with plans at Linton-on-Ouse. With other members of the APPG, I have repeatedly called for Napier Barracks to close and for the UK government not to open any further similar sites. I reiterate that call today.\n“It is time for the government to get a grip and stop with these tactics to divert the attention away from the chaos within this Government. Thousands of human lives are at risk here, they must be protected. During the worst cost of living crisis to date, the Government should be focusing on allowing all people to have enough money to feed themselves, rather than pandering to the dog whistle politics of the far right.”",

In Northern Ireland, third party referrers are obliged under law to report instances of rape, even if doing so means that women are placed in further danger of violence.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“This is as good a time as any for the UK Government to drop the vile and medieval rape clause, and stigmatising two child policy which lies behind it.\n“Esther McVey is now the fifth Secretary of State for the DWP since I was elected in 2015, and the first woman in that time. I want to know from her whether she is comfortable in making a woman who has suffered the trauma of rape, domestic violence and coercive control go through the shame of proving her child was conceived as a result of that sexual abuse.\n“Similarly, I am keen to understand Karen Bradley’s views on the ongoing legal uncertainty in Northern Ireland with respect to this policy. The current system places third party referrers in an impossible position and arguably puts women off claiming an exemption at all. If cases are referred to the police, this potentially places women who are already vulnerable in even more danger at the hands of their abusive partners.\n“So far, the UK Government has failed to listen on this issue. I am hopeful that the Prime Minister’s reshuffle presents an opportunity for the right thing to be done by women and families, and for this abhorrent policy to be rescinded once and for all”.",

The chilling effect of the rape clause on rape victims will discourage women from speaking out about the horrific crimes committed against them, which no-one, regardless of their party political persuasion, wants to see happen in a civilised society.\n“MPs from all major political parties in Northern Ireland must now combine efforts to end the suffering that women and families have endured from changes to child tax credit entitlement.

Since its launch, it has been proven to save lives. If you’re registered with a GP and aged 50-74, you will receive a test in the post every two years. You carry out the simple test at home in private and it comes with step by step instructions.

People come to the UK for many reasons, including family links, the English language, experience of having worked for UK forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, and for the long legacy of empire.\nThere is no system for applying for asylum from abroad. People literally must have their feet on UK soil before they can make an application. They can’t hop on a plane, as they won’t be allowed to board without the appropriate visa. Safe and legal routes are few and far between.\nThe exception to this, of course, has been Ukraine. You won’t find Ukrainians amongst the Iraqis, Iranians and Afghans in rubber dinghies, because for them, there is a functioning safe and legal route. No one would grudge Ukranians this important route to safety, but having proven it works for this group of vulnerable people fleeing conflict, the UK Government really ought to establish routes for other groups who are equally at risk.\nIn many of the cases I have dealt with in my advice surgeries, there are long delays for decisions on their cases. Some have waited for over a year in B&B accommodation for a decision, unable to get on with their lives and contribute as they dearly wish to do.\nThe various schemes the UK Government have proposed to tackle the issue are costing a fortune, sending hundreds of millions of pounds to the French Government, detaining people when they arrive here, and a costly and unworkable deal with Rwanda.\nInvesting more wisely in the boring work of actually processing cases would be a much better use of public funds. Allowing asylum seekers the right to work while waiting for a decision would also be better all round – for the people in the system, for the public purse, and for integration into our communities.\nWe can and must do better than the divisive language of the Home Secretary.

The aim is to reassure people who don’t have a problem and guide those with significant breathlessness to make an appointment with their GP.\nAt the British Lung Foundation’s summer reception, MPs and Peers had a chance to find out more about lung disease and try the ‘breath test’ themselves on iPads.\nAlison Thewliss MP said:\n“Completing the BLF’s online ‘breath test’ is a really easy way of checking your lung health. I’d encourage everyone to try it. It’ll either give you peace of mind or start you on a path to helping you manage your breathlessness.\n“If you’re even slightly worried a loved one has been feeling increasingly short of breath – please make sure they take the test.”\nDr Penny Woods, CEO of British Lung Foundation said:\n“Our reception in Westminster gave us the opportunity to throw the spotlight on breathlessness, which can be sign of lung disease. Fewer than half of us would be concerned at feeling short of breath doing daily tasks. Often people put it down to age or fitness, and don’t seek advice from their GP.\n“There are thousands of people in Glasgow with a lung condition, but not everyone’s aware they have one. It’s great to have support from Alison Thewliss MP in encouraging people to ‘Listen to their lungs’ if they feel breathless. Together we can ensure that those people who are suffering with an undiagnosed lung condition seek help and get the support they need. With treatment, people can live longer, healthier lives.”\nOver 250,000 people have taken the test since it was launched last year. Over 70% of people who have taken the test have had medically concerning levels of breathlessness.\nThe BLF’s Listen to your lungs campaign complements the Scottish Government’s national Detect Cancer Early campaign, which aims to increase the proportion of people who are diagnosed in the early stages of breast, bowel and lung cancer.

It is an inherently risky journey for people who are already vulnerable and desperate.\nHowever, there is no evidence to suggest that this Bill will have any impact on the number of dangerous crossings, or that a restrictive asylum policy in general acts as a deterrent. It is clear that the Home Office is aware of the limitations of these kinds of policies. In 2022, the Rwanda scheme lacked evidence to the point where the Civil Service was unable to confirm its value for public money.\nIt is extremely worrying to see the UK Government press ahead with policies which pose a serious and consistent threat to our international human rights obligations. It is worse still when these policies show no promise of delivering their intended consequences. This Bill will not make people safe – it will put victims of trafficking and modern slavery even more at risk, and leave refugees fleeing persecution in limbo, or offshored thousands of miles away.\nParliamentarians in both Scotland and the UK are human rights guarantors, and an important part of our role is to ensure that legislation is compliant with international obligations on human rights. The incompatibility of the Bill with the European Convention on Human Rights, the Refugee Convention, The Convention of Action Against Trafficking, and the Convention on the Rights of the Child means that we as lawmakers are obliged to vote against it.\nThe undermining of rights conveyed upon individuals by these agreements must be resisted by all spheres of government. This Bill will negatively impact directly on those seeking international protection in Scotland, as well as on the powers and duties of the Scottish Government, local authorities, and other public bodies under the devolution settlement. We call upon MSPs to withhold legislative consent when this legislation is put before the Scottish Parliament.\nArbitrary detention of refugee and asylum-seeking children and their families, trafficking victims, victims of torture and other vulnerable people is entirely unacceptable. You may recall that Scotland led the way in campaigning against child detention. In May 2010, Dungavel was closed to children, with detention centres elsewhere in the UK rapidly following suit. It is unthinkable that we now face a situation where these rights are being rolled back.\nScotland’s refugee and asylum-seeking community deserves better. The Home Office have shown time and time again that they cannot be trusted when it comes to looking after vulnerable children and adults.\nWe urge all Scottish parliamentarians to take a principled stand against this pernicious legislation.\nYours sincerely,\nAlan Brown MP\nAlison Thewliss MP\nAlasdair Allan MSP\nAllan Dorans MP\nAlyn Smith MP\nAmy Callaghan MP\nAngela Crawley MP\nAngus Brendan MacNeil MP\nAnne McLaughlin MP\nBill Kidd MSP\nBob Doris MSP\nBrendan O’Hara MP\nCarol Monaghan MP\nChris Law MP\nChris Stephens MP\nClare Adamson MSP\nColin Beattie MSP\nCollette Stevenson MSP\nDave Doogan MP\nDavid Linden MP\nDeidre Brock MP\nDouglas Chapman MP\nDr Lisa Cameron MP\nDr Philippa Whitford MP\nDrew Hendry MP\nEmma Roddick MSP\nEvelyn Tweed MSP\nFiona Hyslop MSP\nGavin Newlands MP\nGordon Macdonald MSP\nGraeme Dey MSP\nHannah Bardell MP\nJames Dornan MSP\nJenni Minto MSP\nJoanna Cherry KC MP\nJohn Mason MSP\nJohn McNally MP\nJohn Nicolson MP\nKaukab Stewart MSP\nKenny MacAskill MP\nKirsten Oswald MP\nKirsty Blackman MP\nMarie McNair MSP\nMarion Fellows MP\nMartin Docherty-Hughes MP\nMartyn Day MP\nMhairi Black MP\nMs Anum Qaisar MP\nOwen Thompson MP\nPatrick Grady MP\nPatricia Gibson MP\nPaul McLennan MSP\nPete Wishart MP\nPeter Grant MP\nRichard Thomson MP\nRona Mackay MSP\nRonnie Cowan MP\nRt Hon Ian Blackford MP\nRt Hon Stewart Hosie MP\nRuth Maguire MSP\nSiobhan Brown MSP\nStephanie Callaghan MSP\nStephen Flynn MP\nSteven Bonnar MP\nStewart Malcolm McDonald MP\nStuart McDonald MP\nStuart McMillan MSP\nTommy Sheppard MP",

Marches also took place at five other locations across the country.\nA UK Government-commissioned survey published in 2015 concluded that around 11% of women, having left their job as a result of giving birth, had reported being a victim of workplace discrimination. According to the Equality and Human Rights Commission, if these results were replicated across the country, the cumulative effect would be around 54,000 women being forced out of work each year.\nThe ‘March of the Mummies’ campaign is lobbying the UK Government to increase the time limit for raising a tribunal claim from three months to at least six, and reports that there has been a sharp decline in women employees bringing tribunal claims against their employers since fees for doing so were increased substantially in 2013.\nAlison Thewliss MP said:\n“I pay credit to all who joined in today’s ‘March of the Mummies’ campaign, and to the wider work of the group, Pregnant Then Screwed.\n“Every year thousands of women face the prospect of losing their jobs as a result of pregnancy. This is bad enough, but the fact that the same women then face a serious struggle in accessing justice is simply unacceptable.\n“Some of the stories that I have heard first-hand from women have been truly shocking, and have ranged from women having their work-patterns changed without their knowledge, to those finding out at short-notice that there is simply no job for them to return to once their maternity has ended.\n“It’s encouraging to see the Scottish Government taking steps to tackle pregnancy and maternity discrimination in the workplace, and opening up a formal dialogue with women through the establishment of a working group. However, employment law still resides at Westminster and much more must be done by the UK Government to protect women’s rights. If they won’t, these powers must be devolved to Holyrood.”",
  "http_www_alisonthewliss_scot/http_www_alisonthewliss_scot_partial-victory-as-government-issues-new-guidance-on-asylum-volunteers/content_494.html": "Alison Thewliss, SNP MP for Glasgow Central, has welcomed changes in Home Office guidance, which has been issued to asylum decision makers just days after she raised complaints about “fundamentally flawed” rules surrounding asylum seekers volunteering and working.\nJust two days after raising the case of her constituent Olivier Mondeke Monongo – a Christian Pastor from the Democratic Republic of Congo – the Home Office quietly issued new guidance to its decision makers, making explicitly clear that “it is Home Office policy to support asylum seekers volunteering for charities or public sector organisations”.\nThe Christian Pastor and his family were granted refugee status in the UK several years ago but he was later denied British citizenship because he had volunteered for the British Red Cross as an interpreter during his claim for asylum. At the time, doing such volunteering was considered in breach of his asylum application conditions and a sign of ‘bad character’. Monongo, who is also a mental health nurse for the NHS, cannot now re-apply for British citizenship until 2020.\nIn light of the guidance which has just been issued, Ms Thewliss is now asking for Ministerial discretion to be used to allow Olivier and his family to apply for British citizenship immediately.\nCommenting, the Glasgow Central MP said:\n“This new guidance makes much clearer that volunteering should not be regarded as a sign of bad character and indeed encouraged. This will be of great comfort to individuals and to the organisations who value the contribution volunteers make.\n“The previous rules were fundamentally flawed and led to an honest and upstanding member of the community being denied British citizenship, simply because he volunteered for the British Red Cross. That is absolutely ridiculous.\n“I’m glad that my debate in Westminster Hall last week highlighted the folly of this policy; I’m very glad to see revised policy being issued to Home Office decision makers. However, I went into Westminster Hall last week with two asks – one was to make sure people can’t be penalised for volunteering and the other was to lift the ban on asylum seekers working. Although I’m pleased that there has been progress on the first issue, I am still going to pursue the wider issue of allowing asylum seekers to take up paid employment, which we know would save the Government tens of millions of pounds.\n“As for my constituent Olivier, I am today writing to the Home Secretary Amber Rudd and asking her to personally intervene and set in motion the process of allowing Olivier and his family to apply for citizenship – not in 2020 but now.”",

Arthritis and other musculoskeletal conditions like back pain affect one in six of us.\nMusculoskeletal conditions cause pain, stiffness and fatigue that can make every day work tasks such as sitting, standing, walking, lifting, and typing difficult. They are the leading cause of workplace absence in the UK, causing 32.4 million sick days each year.\nOnly 60% of working age people with a musculoskeletal condition are in work, compared to 80% among those without a health condition or a disability. This ‘arthritis work gap’ means that 600,000 people with arthritis are currently missing out on the opportunity to work.\nNow, following the Government’s Improving Lives consultation on employment support for disabled people, Ms Thewliss is calling on the Government to ensure that people with arthritis have the support to stay at work for longer:\n“It’s clear how enormous the impact of arthritis and musculoskeletal conditions is on our local communities. The ability to work is something that we often take for granted, but I’ve learnt today that for those living with arthritis this can be an incredibly difficult task. Undoubtedly thousands of local people with conditions like this want to work, but do not always have the necessary support to be able to do so.\n“That’s why I’m supporting Arthritis Research UK’s ‘Work Matters to Me’ campaign, putting this vital issue on the map. The Government must ensure that there is a level playing field so that people with arthritis who are able to work have the right support and employment opportunities.”\nDr Liam O’Toole, chief executive officer at Arthritis Research UK, commented:\n“I’m delighted that Alison Thewliss MP is supporting our campaign to give people with arthritis the freedom from their condition in employment, enabling them to live their life to the full.\n“The current situation for people living with the daily pain of arthritis is untenable. Arthritis and musculoskeletal conditions such as back pain are the number one cause for workplace sickness absence in the UK.\n“Our retirement age has increased and we’re an ageing working population, so even more people are going to be living with the pain and unpredictability of arthritis, and face an uncertain working future.\n“But with the right kind of support and job; work can benefit your mental and physical health as well as financial position.\n“We need to see Government action to address the employment needs of people with long term conditions such as arthritis, so that they have the right support and opportunity to maintain their freedom and quality of life.”",

It was absolutely fascinating to see the vaults and I was really impressed about the security in place.\n“Some people may previously have relied on banks for a safety deposit facility; sadly with so many high street banks cutting back on local branches, that is less of an option now. People may still wish the reassurance of a safe, secure place to keep important documents or valuables, and Glasgow Vaults seek to fill that gap in provision.\n“It’s great that we have such a top class and unique facility here in Glasgow and I wish Glasgow Vaults every success in the future as they continue to go from strength to strength.”\nTake a look at Newcastle Vault\nCompleted 2016/17\nAnd more recently\nLiverpool Vaults\nSituated within the Liverbuilding",

Third party professionals, such as doctors, midwives, social workers and support workers, could potentially face a prison sentence of up to 10 years if they fail to disclose that a woman has been raped when completing the rape clause form – even if doing so means that women are placed in further danger of violence and sexual assault from their abusive partners.\nSpeaking ahead of the rally, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“Since its introduction in April, the rape clause has caused untold harm and distress across the UK. The cruelty of forcing women to relive the worst ordeal of their life, just in order to make a claim for benefit, shows the morally repugnant depths to which the UK Government has plumbed.\n“As if this wasn’t bad enough, women in Northern Ireland face a very specific risk under existing laws, which requires crimes such as rape to be reported to the police by the third party referrer. Women in abusive relationships are therefore placed in an appalling situation where either they are forced into the criminal justice system or they will struggle to afford to pay bills and put food on the table.\n“The rape clause also puts professionals in Northern Ireland in an incredibly difficult position, as they face the prospect of their reputations and careers being destroyed if they do not report that a woman has been raped to the police. It’s no coincidence that a growing number of trade unions and women’s aid groups have refused to endorse the third party referral mechanism for claims made under the rape clause, given the risks it presents to their members.\n“The rape clause could criminalise incredibly vulnerable women and the professionals who would wish to support them in Northern Ireland. I’ll be asking all of Northern Ireland’s MPs to join me in demanding an end to the two child policy and rape clause and the misery and poverty it has created for families across the UK.”",

According to research by Anthony Nolan, one in five are not offered any specialist care to help with their recovery, which includes access to physiotherapists, counsellors, and fertility experts.\nAnthony Nolan is calling on health commissioners across the UK to urgently review the care arrangements they have in place for transplant recipients once they leave hospital, to ensure that patients and their families can continue to access vital support and services.\nAt an event in the House of Commons on Wednesday 11 October, Alison Thewliss MP heard from patient representatives about how difficult recovery can be without appropriate support.\nAlison Thewliss MP said:\n“A number of my constituents have got in touch to bring this issue to my attention, so I know how important it is for people in Glasgow that stem cell transplant patients and their families receive appropriate support.\n“No patient’s recovery should be made more difficult by a lack of care and support, and that’s why I’m backing Anthony Nolan’s campaign, urging health commissioners to review the care arrangements they have in place once transplant patients leave hospital.”\nHenny Braund, Chief Executive of Anthony Nolan, said:\n“It’s vital that health commissioners carry out an urgent review into the long-term care that stem cell transplant recipients need throughout their recovery, so we’re delighted to have the support of Alison Thewliss MP in raising awareness of this issue in Parliament and in their constituency.\n“Anthony Nolan is calling on health commissioners to work with us and the clinical community and make sure that post-transplant care works for every patient, to ensure they get the support they need to make a good recovery.”",

The decision was met with widespread, cross-party condemnation, with many MPs commenting that closures would place an additional burden on those already struggling to make ends meet.\nIn a passionate plea during Prime Minister’s Questions, the SNP MP noted that a constituent of hers who is 58, has a variety of serious health concerns, and was only recently discharged from hospital, attended Bridgeton JobCentre on Tuesday, only to find it was closed. Ms Thewliss asked the Prime Minister to apologise to her constituent for not having made her aware of the JobCentre’s closure, and to refund her taxi fare.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“This situation really is absurd. Not only are my constituents who previously used Bridgeton JobCentre expected to travel to alternative locations to attend mandatory appointments, it appears that the government hasn’t even told them that their local JobCentre has closed.\n“Unfortunately, whilst shocking, the case I raised during PMQs will not be unique. People will be turning up to JobCentres across Glasgow to find out for the first time that their local service no longer exists.\n“The DWP holds extensive details of every claimant: they should take responsibility for their actions and write to everyone on their database to inform them about the closures.\n“Surely the government must see what a shambles this whole process has been.

MPs heard about the action that Together for Short Lives would like the Chancellor of the Exchequer to take to help these vulnerable families when he delivers his Budget on 8 March.\nDuring the reception Ms Thewliss heard from Rachel Thompson, the mother of nine year old Frank who was diagnosed with a rare life-limiting condition when he was just four. Rachel told parliamentarians about the pressures of coordinating Frank’s 24/7 care and the support she and her family receive from their local children’s palliative care services.\nThe reception also saw the launch of the new All-Party Parliamentary Group for Children Who Need Palliative Care. The group will provide an important forum for MPs and Peers to hear about the issues facing these seriously ill children – and what action they can take in Parliament to help.\nChildren with life-limiting conditions require a wide range of professionals working together across different health and care services to support them. Unfortunately, there is a postcode lottery of support for children and their families as many cannot access the care that they need. This is because it is not available in their area or there are not enough professionals with the right skills and experience to care for them.\nAlison Thewliss MP said\n“I really appreciated having the opportunity to hear Frank’s story and to learn about the wonderful support he receives from a range of services, including his local children’s hospice.\n“It was evident at the reception that there is much more to do to help families overcome the serious challenges they face on a day to day basis. I support the charity’s call to make the mobility component of the Disability Living Allowance available to children under three who are dependent on heavy and bulky life support equipment. Currently this benefit is only available to children aged three or over. I look forward to working with Together for Short Lives in Parliament to support children with life-limiting and life-threatening conditions and their families.”\nYou can find out more about Together for Short Lives’ work to transform the lives of children with life-limiting conditions at www.togetherforshortlives.org.uk or join the conversation using #forthe49000.",

Instead however, the UK Government has actively chosen to restrict these benefits since 2015. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation has previously estimated that the measure will push half a million families over the poverty line by 2020.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“The callousness of this Tory government never ceases to shock me. It is truly appalling that they have presided over a freeze on working-age benefits for hundreds of thousands of people across the country, while living costs have increased.\n“It seems that the UK Government will pursue a budget surplus at any cost, and if that means forcing thousands of families below the poverty line, then so be it. This is purely ideological and cruel, and it must stop.\n“The Tories have rightfully received harsh scrutiny on their shambolic Universal Credit policy, but the benefit freeze could potentially be even more damaging to low-income families.\n“In September this year, inflation stood at 2.4%, meaning that everything is 2.4% more expensive than it was 12 months ago. The Institute of Fiscal Studies has estimated that this will translate to a £150 shortfall in household budgets over a 12 month period, leading to families being up to £800 a year worse off by 2020.\n“Theresa May has the audacity to say that austerity is over. It certainly isn’t in my constituency.\n“This government has form when it comes to balancing the books on the backs of low-earners, but to perpetuate a benefits freeze – particularly against the backdrop of the Brexit shambles – would be particularly malevolent. I urge the Chancellor to lift the freeze, and to give ordinary people a break”.",

These employers form part of a network in Scotland which has seen over 700 Scottish-based employers sign up for Living Wage accreditation.\nMs Thewliss has repeatedly highlighted the existing inequality within the UK Government’s so-called “National Living Wage”, which is only paid to workers over 25 and is £1.50 per hour below the real Living Wage rate of £8.45 per hour outside London. Ms Thewliss has consistently called on the UK Government to raise the minimum wage rate to match the real Living Wage and extend it to all workers over the age of 16.\nCommenting on the research, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“I am delighted that so many employers in my constituency have taken the important step of achieving Living Wage accreditation.\n“Living Wage accreditation demonstrates an employer’s commitment to supporting their employees, as well as bringing benefits to productivity and morale. Research conducted by the Scottish Living Wage Foundation has revealed overwhelming numbers of employers believe that the Living Wage has improved their employees’ quality of work and highlighted a reduction of absenteeism of 25% in Living Wage employers.\n“The positive benefits of paying all workers the Living Wage is also recognised by the Scottish Government’s Business Pledge, which has over 300 businesses signed up so far. The Living Wage is a key part of the Scottish Government’s efforts to promote fair work across Scotland. I want to see this progress continue for all workers in Scotland and I have consistently called on the UK Government to commit to paying a Living Wage for all workers.\n“I am pleased to see that so many employers in Glasgow are committing to the Living Wage, however I know there are employers who meet the criteria for the Living Wage and are not yet accredited. I encourage employers to seek Living Wage status and demonstrate their commitment to fair pay.”",
  "http_www_alisonthewliss_scot/https_www_alisonthewliss_scot_glasgow-snp-budget-statement/content_309.html": "Glasgow’s team of SNP MPs have today (Wednesday 16th March) railed against Chancellor George Osborne’s budget, which they say will “condemn the city to a decade of austerity”.\nTeam Glasgow highlighted a number of cruel policy announcements in Osborne’s budget which will have a detrimental impact on Glaswegians.\nGlasgow Central MP, Alison Thewliss, said:\n“This is a bad budget for Glasgow and reminds us that nothing and no-one is safe from the Tory axe. The SNP advocates a more balanced approach to the budget which would return the UK’s finances to a sustainable path whilst, crucially, still investing in public services. Today’s Tory cuts will only heap further unnecessary pressure on the public sector. The Chancellor has confirmed a decade of austerity. It is austerity through choice, not necessity.”\nGlasgow North West MP, Carol Monaghan – a Physics Teacher at Hyndland Secondary School before becoming an MP – warned that the Chancellor’s budget is devastating for Glasgow’s young people. She said:\n“In his 2015 Summer Budget, the Chancellor announced he would be slashing student maintenance grants for some of the poorest students, and converting them into loans. Today the Chancellor also scrapped automatic entitlement to housing benefit for unemployed 18-21 year olds, which the homeless charity Crisis condemned and said would result in an increase in homelessness.”\nChris Stephens, MP for Glasgow South West, said:\n“The Tories have already cut Scotland’s budget by £2.4 billion and plan to make a further £1.3 billion of cuts by 2019/20. Welfare cuts in particular mean that 100,000 additional Scottish children will move into relative poverty by 2020. In announcing today’s budget, the Chancellor has just condemned this city and the rest of Scotland to a decade of austerity.”\nStewart McDonald, MP for Glasgow South, said:\n“This harsh Tory budget means that the Scottish Government will see a real terms reduction of £1.5 billion in the funding for day to day public services over the next four years – that is bad news for public sector workers in Glasgow”.\nGlasgow North East MP, Anne McLaughlin, said:\n“The Chancellor is cutting benefits for the disabled, the sick and the vulnerable to fund a tax cut for high earners. Just last week, the DWP announced major changes to Personal Independence Payments. It is estimated that these changes will adversely impact 640,000 people, a large number of whom are Glaswegians. However, we know from today’s budget that this has allowed the Chancellor to give a tax cut to top earners and pull hundreds of thousands of people out of the higher rate of income tax.\n“Put simply, the Chancellor is taking from the disabled to give to his pals in the city of London. The only people who are “better together” are the Chancellor’s cronies because it certainly doesn’t feel like we’re better together for my constituents.”\nPatrick Grady, SNP MP, for Glasgow North, concluded by saying the only way to firmly reject Tory austerity was to send a clear message at May’s Holyrood election by using both votes for the SNP. He said: “Today’s Tory budget reminds us why – now more than ever – we need a strong SNP Scottish Government to stand up to Westminster.\n“The best way to send a clear message to the Tories that we won’t take another decade of austerity is to vote SNP. Whether you live in Summerston, Shettleston or Shawlands, it’s got to be both votes SNP in May.”",

Universities are already facing challenges in attracting international students due to the removal of the post-study work visa, and students are choosing to go instead to countries which make them make them more welcome.\n“UK Government moves to further restrict international students will only serve to undermine the efforts of universities. This comes as yet a further blow to universities which are already set to lose crucial Horizon 2020 funding.\n“The UK’s decision to leave the European Union in June – despite Scotland voting overwhelmingly to remain – has already caused concern for EU nationals currently studying in Scotland. Theresa May’s Government should be focussing on making people feel welcome – not digging a deeper moat, pulling up the drawbridge and adopting a little Britain attitude.”",

Over a year later, and despite Parliament sitting for over 5 weeks since the election, the legislation has still not been enacted by Parliament.\nAt Business Questions, Ms Thewliss called on Government Ministers today to bring the VAT relief scheme into operation as soon as possible. A motion has also been tabled, signed by MPs from across the House of Commons with affected museums in their constituencies, to call on the UK Government to put the draft law on the statute book immediately.\nSpeaking after Business Questions, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“Museums and art galleries across Scotland and the UK have unique and specialist collections which enrich our culture and heritage. With incomes for culture and the arts facing swingeing cuts from the UK Government, the VAT relief scheme is increasingly important to allow museums to devote more resources to educating and informing the public.\n“The weakness of the UK Government is clear for all to see – not only have they had to ditch many planned Bills following the Prime Minister’s botched election gamble, it now transpires that they are unable to get simple, uncontroversial statutory instruments through Parliament quickly.\n“Museums and art galleries across the UK are suffering from the dithering at the heart of Theresa May’s weak and wobbly Government. The Government must act now to honour the applications made for VAT refunds and provide certainty for hard-pressed museums and art galleries across the UK.”",

Parliamentarians also got the chance to pose for photographs with Fairtrade Ambassador Nick Hewer, famous for his roles on Countdown and The Apprentice.\nFairtrade Fortnight 2018 will challenge the British public to open their doors to Fairtrade and help close the door on the exploitation facing farmers and producers in developing nations.\nThe nationwide campaign ‘Come On In’ runs from Monday 26 February until Sunday 11 March and will invite the public to come in to the world of the people who grow our food to see what life can be like when farmers and workers aren’t paid fairly. The campaign will explore how businesses, farmers, workers and shoppers can come together through Fairtrade to change this.\nThousands of events will be taking place around the country including breakfasts, breaks, bake-offs and more as people ‘Come On In’ and find out more about Fairtrade.\nAlison Thewliss MP said:\n“It is wonderful to be able to show my support for Fairtrade alongside my fellow parliamentarians.\n“Fairtrade Fortnight is a hugely important event and I would encourage the people of Glasgow to get involved wherever they can.\n“We can all play a role in ensuring a fair deal for farmers and producers in developing nations simply by ensuring we buy Fairtrade wherever possible.”\nCheryl McGechie, Director of Public Engagement, The Fairtrade Foundation said:\n“This Fairtrade Fortnight, we are inviting people to ‘Come On In’ to find out what Fairtrade does for farmers and see what exploitation looks like when trade doesn’t deliver.\n“There has never been a better time to stand alongside the people who produce the things we love to eat, drink and wear. People who often do not earn enough to feed, or provide for their own families.\n“This unfairness must end. By buying Fairtrade you are guaranteeing farmers a fair price for their efforts. This Fairtrade Fortnight ‘Come On In’ to Fairtrade.”\nBrad Hill, Fairtrade Strategy Manager at Co-op, said:\n“From selling the UK’s first Fairtrade bananas and the world’s very first own-brand product with the Fairtrade Mark, through to making entire own-brand categories Fairtrade we at Co-op have continued to drive the benefits of Fairtrade. We will continually look for ways and areas that we can develop to help make positive impact and life changes for farmers in developing countries.\n“Last year we extended our commitment further in a retailer first and announced that all the cocoa sourced for own brand products will be sourced on Fairtrade terms. This year we will be increasing our sourcing of the other core Fairtrade commodities to drive further Fairtrade Premium to producer communities. Our recent move saw us become the first in the world to adopt the new Fairtrade Sourced Ingredient program on flowers, meaning that all the African roses Co-op sources for use across our entire flower range will return a Fairtrade Premium. Some 35 million Co-op rose stems a year are now certified as Fairtrade and will go to help graduate nurses find employment in Kenya.\n“We believe the right approach is to build upon the success of Fairtrade. That’s why in addition to our sourcing commitments we are investing directly to extend further the benefits of our trading relationship and investing directly in our producers and their communities.”\nTony Rowson, Head of Retail at Greggs said:\n“As a responsible business, we believe in doing the right thing and are incredibly proud to be a long-standing partner of Fairtrade.\n“A number of our products, including coffee, tea, sugar and bananas, are certified Fairtrade and we continue to add more items to the menu, including green tea and peppermint tea more recently.\n“Having worked with Fairtrade for over ten years now, it has been incredible to see the positive impact and difference it makes to producer communities and we look forward to strengthening our relationship further in the future.”",

Thewliss has called this move a ‘tactic in the ongoing pay dispute with postal workers’ and has accused Royal Mail of ‘acting in bad faith’.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“Postal workers across Glasgow Central are struggling to make ends meet in the face of the cost-of-living crisis while Royal Mail shareholders benefited from bumper profits in the millions.\n“It is understandable that postal workers find the argument that there isn’t money for them to have a fair wage unpalatable when there are millions of pounds of profit for shareholders, who should share the burden – when hard working postal staff are struggling to put food on their table this winter.\n“Royal Mail staff in Glasgow Central and their families need financial security. The decision to strike will not have been easy for any of them, but this is about more than pay; it is also about protecting the universal mail service we all expect and value.\n“Royal Mail need to get back to the negotiating table – in a meaningful way – and put our communities at the heart of discussions.”",

We know that tax and benefit changes since 2010 will have hit women’s incomes twice as hard as men by 2020. Women will be on average over £1,000 worse off by 2020; for men, that figure will be £555.\n“The Autumn Statement was a missed opportunity for our new female Prime Minister to stand up for women. Instead, it appears the Prime Minister has pulled the ladder up behind her.\n“As part of the continued economic offensive against women, last month’s Autumn Statement was a missed opportunity to scrap the rape clause and two child policy. It was a missed opportunity to deliver justice for women affected by state pension inequality, who are being forced to work longer for their pension. It was a missed opportunity to give everyone access to a real living wage.\n“I also pressed the Minister on the on-going tampon tax. Whilst it’s welcome that the Government is diverting VAT raised from the tampon tax into women’s good causes, the reality remains that I and millions of other women are still being taxed every month for having periods. The Government need to press ahead without haste and secure agreement from Europe to abolish the tampon tax.\n“My colleague Angela Crawley MP has been doing a sterling job in campaigning against the 4% fee levied on Child Maintenance Service payments for women and children trying to rebuild their lives after domestic abuse.

He is now facing eviction from his home, along with his wife and children, as he is unable to work until his case is heard.\nOther constituency cases include a gentleman who has been waiting since November 2015 for an appeal regarding an entry visa for his wife.

Due to the diverse nature of Glasgow Central, a lot of my casework involves asylum and immigration policy.\n“Over the last year and a half, it has become ever more clear to me that UK immigration policy is not fit for purpose. These shocking figures demonstrate that this Government’s ‘pull up the drawbridge’ approach to immigration is leaving increasing numbers of my constituents in dire straits.\n“A family in my constituency face the very genuine prospect of being made homeless because of these unacceptable delays to tier one tribunals. Others are being separated from loved ones for extended periods. With an average of 5,000 appeals being lodged every month, it is quite clear that access to justice is being blocked by UK Government inaction.\n“A cynic would perhaps suggest that it is convenient for the Government to leave people waiting for months and years in the hope that they simply give up.

Yet, in the case of skilled migrants, these are the very actions being interpreted by the Home Office as somehow unacceptable.\n“From the Minister’s response today, it’s manifestly clear that there is a lack of joined up thinking across government. Many of the individuals affected by this merciless policy are working in highly skilled occupations, and have put down roots in this country and contributed greatly both to their communities and to the economy.\n“The UK Government should be doing its utmost to make the UK an attractive place for these people to stay, instead it is actively presiding over a hostile environment policy which is ruining people’s lives.\n“I urge the Treasury to bring what pressure it can to bear on the Home Office, to make clear that legitimately correcting a tax return should not later lead to a threat of removal from the UK”.",

This is despite the fact that a huge 86% of this group have seen no improvement to their financial situation over the last year.\nNearly three-fifths (58%) of those in Scotland who aren’t receiving this support said they had been deterred from checking or claiming potential benefits entitlements because they did not think they would be eligible.

As a result, over three-quarters (77%) have not checked what welfare benefits they could be entitled to within the last year.\nFurthermore, over two-thirds (67%) would not consider checking their benefits entitlements if their income dropped, and only 2% would turn to a charity for help. Yet nearly two-fifths (37%) said they would cut back on gas, electricity and other essentials, and over a quarter (28%) would resort to cutting back on food.\nMs Thewliss pledged her support for the campaign at a special event in parliament this week, commenting:\n“Anyone can find themselves struggling financially and it’s really important that those needing help know where to turn. The benefits system can be a bit daunting, especially if you’ve never claimed before, which is why the Turn2us #BenefitsAware campaign is so important.\n“Over £15bn in welfare benefits went unclaimed last year with £2.8bn in Pension Credit not being taken up. It is nothing short of a tragedy that many of those who are entitled to that support are cutting back on essentials such and food or electricity, or turning to unscrupulous lenders.”\nTurn2us is urging anyone in need to use its free and confidential Benefits Calculator at Turn2us.org.uk to see what they could be entitled to and how to make a claim. The website also features information on benefits and other help for a range of different circumstances.\nSimon Hopkins, Chief Executive of Turn2us said:\n“Through our campaign, we want to show that financial hardship can happen for many different reasons and could affect anyone at any time in their lives. Welfare benefits exist to provide a vital source of support for people in need, including those who are in-work. We would urge anyone struggling to visit our website today to check what support could be available.”\nFor more information about the campaign, please visit Turn2us.org.uk/BenefitsAware.",
  "http_www_alisonthewliss_scot/https_www_alisonthewliss_scot_category_campaigns_page_16/content_425.html": "Alison Thewliss MP has backed a campaign calling for a fair tax deal for Malawi, a country with strong historic links with Glasgow Central.\nActionAid’s #MakeTaxFair campaign is pushing for reform of the 1955 UK-Malawi tax treaty, which makes it possible for UK companies operating in Malawi to dramatically reduce their tax bill. The call is part of a wider campaign to reform unfair tax treaties.\nScotland has had close links with Malawi, dating back to when Scottish explorer David Livingstone arrived in Malawi in the 1850s. Each year, more than 94,000 Scots are involved in organisations that link with Malawi, according to the Scotland Malawi Partnership, the national network which exists to coordinate, represent and support Scotland’s civic links with Malawi, and which is supporting ActionAid’s campaign.\nThe Scotland Malawi Partnership has a number of member organisations in Glasgow Central which have links with Malawi.\nMalawi is one of the poorest countries in the world, with GDP per person of just $255 per year. This is a country where 10.5 million people live in extreme poverty – surviving on less than US$1.90 a day. More tax revenue is desperately needed to improve public services and pay for more doctors and teachers. Malawi has one of the highest child mortality rates in the world with more than one in twenty children dying before the age of 5.\nUK companies are the third largest investor there, with investments worth a total of US$157 million in 2010. Yet the outdated and unfair tax treaty has tied the hands of the Malawian government. The treaty was signed in 1955, prior to Malawi’s independence, by the British Governor on behalf of the governments of the British colonies of Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland.\nThe treaty is so out-of-date that it does not cover the taxation of television related income. The treaty also makes it possible for British multinationals to easily move money out of Malawi untaxed using methods such as interest or management fee payments, dividends or royalties.\nMs Thewliss is supporting a joint campaign with Malawian and UK activists, calling on the Government to replace this treaty with one that is fairer, and that supports Malawi in its fight against poverty.\nSince the campaign launched, both the UK Government and the Government of Malawi issued statements in which they say they hope a treaty can be renegotiated soon. ActionAid and the Scotland Malawi Partnership welcome this progress, and will continue campaigning to ensure that any new treaty is fair and helps Malawi raise revenue to fight poverty.\nCommenting, Ms Thewliss said:\n“Corporate tax scandals show how angry the British public are that big business isn’t paying its fair share.\n“Scotland’s long and enduring relationship with Malawi stretches back over 150 years, and today many local people in [INSERT MP’s CONSTITUENCY] are actively engaged in building up social, cultural and economic ties. But the UK-Malawi tax treaty is not fit for the 21st century.\nThat’s why I’m calling on the UK government to agree a better deal with Malawi – one that ensures that UK companies pay their fair share in one of the world’s poorest countries.”\nCharlie Matthews, ActionAid UK’s Senior Advocacy Adviser, said:\n“Malawi is losing out due to an outdated and unfair treaty, which makes it possible for UK businesses operating there to dramatically reduce their tax bill. Women and girls living in poverty are the ones paying the price as public services like schools and hospitals are starved of funding.\n“ActionAid is working with the Scotland Malawi Partnership to call on the UK government to negotiate a new, fairer treaty, one that makes tax fair for the people of Malawi.”\nDavid Hope Jones of the Scotland-Malawi Partnership said:\n“Scotland is rightly proud of its many links with Malawi which date back more than 150 years to Dr David Livingstone. This dignified two-way people-to-people partnership unites our two nations in solidarity and friendship. Many of our 800+ member organisations across Scotland are concerned at the out-dated 1955 UK-Malawi Tax Treaty. We applaud both the UK and the Malawian Government for their commitment to update this colonial-era treaty, helping Malawi retain more tax revenue for the benefit of the people of Malawi. We look forward to seeing the outcome of the re-negotiation as soon as possible.”",

If you want to be a donor, your family’s agreement is still needed for donation to go ahead, even if you are on the NHS Organ Donor Register.”\nFamilies who agree to donate say it helps with their grief and that they feel enormous sense of pride at knowing their relative gave others the chance of a new beginning.\nFiona Loud, Policy Director of Kidney Care UK, commented: “At least one person dies every single day whilst waiting for a kidney transplant and 90% of the people on the organ donation waiting list in Glasgow Central are waiting for a kidney. You are more likely to need a transplant than to be a donor so please, this Organ Donation Week, just take a few minutes to have a think about what you would do if you needed a transplant, and have that life-saving chat with your family so they know your wishes.”\nAnthony Clarkson, Assistant Director of Organ Donation and Transplantation at NHS Blood and Transplant, said: “We are really grateful for Alison Thewliss MP’s support because hundreds of lives are being lost every year.\n“This Organ Donation Week, tell your family you want to save lives. A few words now can make an extraordinary difference.\n“If you are unsure about donation, please ask yourselves as a family; what would you do if one of you needed a transplant? Would you accept a life-saving organ? If you’d take an organ, shouldn’t you be prepared to donate?”\nThere is a particular need for more black and Asian people to talk about donation. Patients from ethnic minority communities make up 29% of the national transplant waiting list but people from these communities are less likely to agree to donate. Organs from people from the same ethnic background are more likely to be a close match and give the best chance of a positive outcome.",
  "http_www_alisonthewliss_scot/http_www_alisonthewliss_scot_bank-of-scotland-response-albert-drive-closure/content_54.html": "As my constituents may be aware, the Bank of Scotland branch on Albert Drive closed on the 27th July this year. After being contacted by a number of my constituents with concerns about this closure, I was able to raise these concerns directly with Bank of Scotland.\nPlease find Bank of Scotland’s response to my query about the Albert Drive branch closure below:\n“I understand that the closure of our Bank of Scotland branch in Pollokshields last month was disappointing for some members of the community.\n“We never take the decision to close any branch lightly. In this instance, the decision, was based on careful analysis of the usage of the branch over the last few years.\n“Before we made the announcement, we carefully considered the impact closing the branch would have on our customers. Our team visited the community to see for themselves the impact that closing the branch would have, looked at the alternative banking options available, and assessed the availability of public transport to get to the closest alternative branch.\n“We also looked at all information available to us – including the ways customers are choosing to bank with us, the number of vulnerable people in the local area, and the accessibility of alternative banking facilities including the Post Office. After carrying out this assessment, we only went ahead once we were satisfied there are suitable alternatives and sufficient access to cash locally.\n“As part of the industry-wide Cash Action Group process, LINK also independently reviewed overall cash provision in Pollokshields prior to our announcement being made. Given the alternatives available, they did not recommend any additional services.\n“Over the last five years, the number of transactions in our Pollokshields branch had continued to fall. The decline in transactions reflects wider trends across the industry, as people choose to use branches less often – accessing services over the telephone or online, or via the Post Office. The majority of our customers now choose to bank with us in more than one way. For example, 83 per cent of our personal customers at Pollokshields branch were already using other branches and other ways to bank such as Internet and Telephone Banking.\n“Our Bank of Scotland Glasgow Victoria Road branch is less than one mile away and there are regular direct trains to Victoria Road with a journey time of 5 minutes. Our Glasgow Shawlands branch is a little over one mile away and takes around 10 minutes to travel to on the bus. Currently both Glasgow Victoria Road branch and Glasgow Shawlands have extended opening hours in comparison to Pollokshields branch giving customers more convenience when they choose to visit the branch.\n“Through our commercial arrangement with the Post Office, all Bank of Scotland customers can withdraw and deposit cash for free over the counter, and pay in cheques, at any branch of the Post Office.\n“There are also other alternatives in the community including a number of free-to-use cash machines in the area, including three within 0.5 miles at Day Today, Kenmure Street, Friends Convenience Store, Pollokshaws Road, and Sainsbury’s, Darnley Road.\n“People can also use telephone banking or our online services. This means that for many of the day-to-day transactions required by our customers in Pollokshields, there is no need to travel to an alternative Bank of Scotland branch. Many customers find the ease of these alternatives to be preferable to travelling to and from a branch. For those looking to open a bank account, or apply for a loan or a mortgage, applications can be made online, or by phone. For those customers wanting to talk to a mortgage adviser face to face and from a place that suits them, our video call service could be the perfect option. More details can be found on our website.\n“You can be assured that branch staff talked to customers about the service the local Post Office offers and helped those who wished to learn about how to use online and telephone banking. Prior to the closure branch staff contacted vulnerable customers to help them understand the options available to them and supported them through the transition. We understand that some older customers may have concerns about banking online, although only 7 per cent of customers who used the Pollokshields branch are aged 75 plus. We also have a ‘Digital Helpline’ which offers free one-to-one guidance over the phone to support customers using the Internet for banking. Customers with an identified need for this service were provided with contact details, enabling them to get free support if required. We will also supply a free tablet and SIM card with data in cases where people cannot afford to go online.\n“Our online banking provides a variety of tools for managing a customer’s money. If customers are apprehensive about using this, we have a section on our website with a step-by-step guide, showing how they can get set up. We also have a section that explains how customers can protect themselves online. Further details can be found on our website here.\n“We also try to make sure banking is easy for people of all abilities and needs. Customers who have a disability or impairment or would just like extra help can find out more information about the ways we can support them by discussing things with local branch staff or by visiting our website here.”",

In the latest round of funding, St Fillan’s Primary School was awarded £500 and Camglen Road and Hollybrook Academy were awarded £200 each.\nWith more and more supermarkets and businesses using the funds raised from the Scottish Government’s 5p bag charge to support good causes, Ms Thewliss is encouraging groups across Glasgow and beyond to make the most of the funding available for local projects.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“It’s great to see many different schools, community groups and non-profit organisations across Glasgow benefit from this excellent initiative by Asda, which provides vital support for organisations which are working at the heart of the community.\n“I’m also pleased to see that more and more businesses are using the funds raised from the Scottish Government’s 5p bag charge, which has raised over £1 million for charity in the last year alone. This initiative is one of many funding programmes that are available for community groups across Glasgow.\n“I hope many more charities and community groups in Glasgow will take the opportunity to apply for the funds offered from programmes funded by the 5p bag charge and I am always happy to help point groups in the right direction for funding which matches their needs.”",

In the Chancellor’s budget in July 2015, buried within the small print, the UK Government plans to restrict child benefit to two children and force women to provide evidence of exceptional circumstances, such as rape, to claim tax credits for a third child from April 2016. I believe that women having to prove that they had been raped to DWP employees in order to receive social security payments is morally wrong and would cause needless additional trauma, as well as being completely unworkable in practice.\nI’ve highlighted this deeply flawed policy to UK Government ministers, including the Prime Minister, several times in the House of Commons. I put my support towards a petition which received 10,000 signatures in January 2016, forcing the UK Government to issue a written response to the petition and defend this unjust policy. Despite the UK Government running a consultation in October 2016, in which several respondents severely criticised the policy, they intend to press ahead with introducing the policy in April 2017.\nGlasgow Women’s Aid and the Public and Commercial Services Union have also expressed their support for the campaign, along with MPs and MSPs from across the main political parties.\nPlease help us scrap the rape clause today – take action online or follow the campaign on my website, on Facebook and on Twitter.

Speaking in her capacity as the chair of the APPG on Infant Feeding, Thewliss has urged the Government to listen to the concerns of the APPG and end exploitative marketing in the UK. Thewliss has been a champion for new policies that encourage breastfeeding, such as encouraging football clubs across Scotland to declare their stadiums breastfeeding friendly. Thewliss recently spoke at the launch of the Lancet Series which focused on the dangers of the marketing of baby formula in the UK and around the world. Commenting, Alison Thewliss MP said: “On International Women’s Day, it is important to remember the struggles that breastfeeding mothers face across the country. “The Lancet Series demonstrated the reach of the infant formula industry and highlighted the need for immediate action to end the harmful and exploitative marketing. Commercial milk formula is a multi-billion-dollar industry and companies spend considerable sums on marketing, with the purpose of influencing the decisions families make about infant feeding. “The UK Government must fully implement the WHO International Code of Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes to protect our youngest citizens from rapacious marketing.”",

People come to the UK for many reasons, including family links, the English language, experience of having worked for UK forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, and for the long legacy of empire.\nThere is no system for applying for asylum from abroad. People literally must have their feet on UK soil before they can make an application. They can’t hop on a plane, as they won’t be allowed to board without the appropriate visa. Safe and legal routes are few and far between.\nThe exception to this, of course, has been Ukraine. You won’t find Ukrainians amongst the Iraqis, Iranians and Afghans in rubber dinghies, because for them, there is a functioning safe and legal route. No one would grudge Ukranians this important route to safety, but having proven it works for this group of vulnerable people fleeing conflict, the UK Government really ought to establish routes for other groups who are equally at risk.\nIn many of the cases I have dealt with in my advice surgeries, there are long delays for decisions on their cases. Some have waited for over a year in B&B accommodation for a decision, unable to get on with their lives and contribute as they dearly wish to do.\nThe various schemes the UK Government have proposed to tackle the issue are costing a fortune, sending hundreds of millions of pounds to the French Government, detaining people when they arrive here, and a costly and unworkable deal with Rwanda.\nInvesting more wisely in the boring work of actually processing cases would be a much better use of public funds. Allowing asylum seekers the right to work while waiting for a decision would also be better all round – for the people in the system, for the public purse, and for integration into our communities.\nWe can and must do better than the divisive language of the Home Secretary. The anti-racism march through the streets of Glasgow on Saturday gives me hope that there is another way of dealing with this matter, one which recognises that these are our neighbours and that refugees are welcome in Scotland.",

Since 2002, a person waiting for their asylum claim to be decided has been prohibited from working. As asylum seekers cannot lawfully work, they often have to rely on Government or charitable support to live.\nLeading a Westminster parliamentary debate, SNP MP Alison Thewliss, will call for the changes to UK immigration rules. This follows the publication of a working paper by Warwick University last month, which shows that allowing asylum seekers to work could save tens of millions of pounds for the UK Government.\nThewliss will also use the debate to speak about asylum cases she has dealt with in her capacity as the MP for Glasgow Central. Her calls for changes in immigration policy today are supported by a coalition of charities and campaigning groups.\nSpeaking in advance of today’s Westminster debate, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“For far too long, under successive Governments, asylum seekers have too often been viewed with scepticism and treated with contempt. Today’s debate is a real opportunity to refocus and remember the origins of the word asylum – that is the protection granted by a state to someone who has left their home country as a political refugee.\n“The increasingly poor treatment of asylum seekers and the removal of the most basic rights is nothing short of degrading and simply adds further misery to those who have fled persecution, war, famine and sexual violence.\n“I know from speaking to some of the asylum seeking constituents I represent that life is made ever more difficult due to the draconian restrictions placed upon them by the UK Government. These restrictions range from the threat of detention, regular and unsettling signing sessions at the Home Office, right through to the ban on working.\n“We know that permitting asylum seekers to work would allow them to integrate better into society, develop their English and make friends in what can often be a lonely and new environment. Many are professionals with skills they would love to put to use. This powerful working paper from Warwick University also sets out the significant savings that the Government could make if it made a fairly modest change to the immigration rules.\n“Another issue I plan to raise in today’s debate relates to the punitive rules the Government has around volunteering and unpaid work.\n“Currently, the Government views certain cases of volunteering as being a sign of ‘bad character’. This fallacy in policy is exemplified by a Christian Pastor in my constituency who was given leave to remain in the UK, and was seeking full British citizenship. However, he was denied that because he did voluntary work for the British Red Cross. This is absolutely ludicrous and I’ll be looking for answers on this from Ministers today.”",

I hope the UK Government will adopt similarly proportionate and sensible measures to protect animal welfare across the UK.\nThe charity’s Advocacy Manager Jacqui Cuff said:\n“Cats are one of the nation’s favourite pets so it was wonderful to welcome so many politicians to discuss how we can improve feline welfare in the UK.\n“Sadly, despite their popularity, we see huge numbers of cats and kittens coming into our care every year. Cats Protection works tirelessly to tackle the root of the problem, by promoting neutering and offering advice and information on responsible cat ownership.\n“This year we have also launched our True Cost of Kittens campaign to highlight a growing kitten breeding industry which frequently puts profit before welfare. As part of this campaign, we’ve been calling for a change in the law to better protect kittens and cats from poor breeding practices that frequently lead to serious health issues.\n“Throughout the year, we have been asking MPs for their help in pushing forward these changes which will greatly improve the welfare of cats in the UK. So this Christmas, we thought we’d ask them to get involved in one of the more creative and fun areas of our work – coming up with names for the cats in our care.\n“There’s been some lovely suggestions and we’ll be choosing our seven favourites – one for every day of the week – which will be used for cats that come into our care during the New Year.”",

Adding to this miserable situation, Yemen is now at risk of famine.\n“The in-country aid workers I spoke to recently told me some really horrific stories about their work in the Yemen. Workers being stopped at checkpoints are being exposed to serious risk, and indiscriminate bombing is severely limiting the action NGOs and aid workers can safely take to meet the growing humanitarian need.\n“I am grateful to the Minister for undertaking to raise these concerns later this week when he visits Saudi Arabia.\n“We cannot stand back any longer whilst Yemen is in such severe crisis”.",

  "http_www_alisonthewliss_scot/https_www_alisonthewliss_scot_un-launches-probe-into-pernicious-two-child-policy/content_374.html": "SNP MP, Alison Thewliss, has welcomed moves by the United Nations to launch an investigation into the UK’s proposed rape clause and two child policy for tax credits.\nIn February, Ms Thewliss wrote to Ban Ki-moon, Secretary General of the United Nations, and asked the UN to investigate whether the UK Government’s proposed rape clause and two child policy breached the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which the UK signed in 1990.\nThe SNP politician believes that the UK Government’s “medieval” proposals could breach at least five of the fifty-four articles in the UN Convention of the Rights of the Child.\nRecently, the UN responded to Ms Thewliss and confirmed that it also had concerns about the UK’s proposed welfare policies. Accordingly, the UN’s Committee on the Rights of the Child will be launching an investigation next week.\nMs Thewliss welcomed the UN’s intervention and said:\n“Everyone knows that the medieval two child policy and rape clause is unworkable, immoral and is now almost certainly in contravention of the UN Convention of the Rights of the Child, which the UK signed up to almost twenty five years ago.\n“I warmly welcome the UN’s decision to intervene and shine a very bright light onto this cruel and thoughtless Government, which appears hell bent on making life as difficult as possible for ordinary people.\n“It is clear that, over the last ten months, the Tories had hoped this campaign would be quietly dropped but the fact it has caught the attention of the UN suggests this policy is now totally untenable. The UN probe is a major boost to our campaign to end the pernicious two child policy and rape clause.\n“This Government simply cannot be allowed to get away with a policy that is tantamount to social engineering.”",

I’m delighted to support the Marie Curie Appeal and I encourage all my constituents to help raise money for Marie Curie this March.”\nJason Isaacs, who is best known for playing Lucius Malfoy in the Harry Potter films, said:\n“I’m delighted to be joined by Alison Thewliss MP to help launch Marie Curie’s Great Daffodil Appeal.\n“Please help us make every daffodil count. The charity is also calling on more people to help with local collections. Volunteering a couple hours of your time will make such a difference to the care and support that Marie Curie can provide.”\nScott Sinclair, Head of Policy and Public Affairs at Marie Curie, said:\n“Having the support of Alison Thewliss MP and Jason Isaacs makes a huge difference to Marie Curie in terms of raising awareness about what we do and helping us to reach more people who need us.\n“One in four people miss out on the care and support they need at the end of life. We don’t think that’s good enough. That’s why we are asking MPs to help support our annual Marie Curie fundraising appeal to help enable us to reach more people affected by terminal illness.”\n“Our services rely on charitable donations, so I’d like to say a big thank you to everyone who gives a donation and wears a daffodil pin during March.”\nSally Monger Godfrey, Marie Curie Nurse and face of The Great Daffodil Appeal, said:\n“Make every daffodil count. Your daffodil means I can care for someone in their own home, and be there for them through the night. You make a difference to people at the end of their lives, which in many ways is just as important as at the start.”\nFor more information about volunteering for a local collection call 0800 304 7025 or visit www.mariecurie.org.uk/daffodil.",

  "http_www_alisonthewliss_scot/https_www_alisonthewliss_scot_mp-to-invoke-rare-standing-order-for-emergency-commons-debate/content_326.html": "An MP will invoke a rarely used Standing Order in the House of Commons today (Monday), with a view to forcing an emergency parliamentary debate on the UK Government’s “chaotic” two child policy and rape clause – due to come into force in just 18 days. Ministers want to limit payment of tax credits two children per family. The Government has designed an exemption to the policy for rape survivors, dubbed ‘the rape clause’, which will mean rape victims will need to prove their child was born as a result of sexual violence in order to qualify for tax credits.\nTory Ministers last week quietly used a negative statutory instrument to try and railroad the rape clause onto the statute books without a parliamentary debate or vote.\nThe Government has stated that it will expect nurses, doctors and social workers to act as third party arbitrators. This means that public service workers will have to judge whether or not a child has been conceived as a result of rape, simply in order for a woman to be exempt from the two child policy.\nAlison Thewliss is today invoking the House of Commons Standing Order 24 in a bid to force the issue onto the floor of the House. She has written to the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, indicating her application for a 3 hour emergency debate. Under the provisions of Standing Order 24, the Speaker will have to make a ruling on Ms Thewliss’ application from the chair today (Monday).\nAlison Thewliss MP said:\n“With just days until this policy comes into force, this Government is about to unleash utter chaos and untold distress in the public service. This will be in addition to the trauma that rape victims will need endure as they recount and relive the brutal sexual violence they experienced.\n“As it currently stands, doctors, nurses and social workers are going to be asking survivors of sexual abuse to prove they were raped in order to receive tax credits. They’ve been given no guidance, no training and no advice as to how this should be done. That is truly frightening.\n“By invoking Standing Order 24 today, I am pleading with the Speaker to grant an emergency debate on the floor of the House, so we can shine a very bright light on the horror that is about to unfold for rape victims.\n“At every turn, this Government has ducked and dived, they’ve used every trick in the book to sneak this policy through without debate. In light of the issue around lack of training and guidance on this serious matter, I am hopeful that the Speaker will grant this urgent debate.”\nThis is an outrageous, mysogenistic, sexist policy and will cause emotional trauma to the .hild involved. It is entirely un enforceable. I have trained as a nurse, midwife and health visitor and would be entirely unprepared to make a decision like this. The police and courts struggle with proving rape and prosecuting rapists even with training and resources.\nThe welfare of the child must also be considered. What will it do the the emotional health of a child to know the family finances depend on him/her being the unplanned product of violence.\nMy final objection is that, yet again, the Government are punishing those with the least resilience in society, making the poorest pay for the dreadful financial policies in the past. Let’s limit some wealthy financiers to 2 children and put their tax up if they choose to have more….. unless they are raped of course.",

Tampons are not a luxury item – they are a basic requirement for women and should not be subject to tax.\n“Up until now the UK Government has suggested that a change in the law to abolish the tax wouldn’t be possible due to EU rules and I’ve been willing, to some extent, to allow them the space to negotiate this with the European Commission, however, there has been speculation that a decision on this will be forthcoming in the very near future, therefore we’re going to press this to vote next week, in the hope we can force substantial action on an issue that has run on far too long.”",

In 2015 for example, there was 47 new diagnoses of HIV compared to an annual average of 10, for those who are injecting drugs. Indeed, there is thought to be around 500 people who regularly inject drugs in public places in Glasgow City Centre alone.\n“I can attest to the fact that Glasgow has a growing problem with respect to public injecting; my constituency office often receives reports of needles and other drug paraphernalia being discarded in public places. In addition, I have seen for myself public injecting taking place in locations not far from where my office is located.\n“It’s clear to me that the drug injecting population in Glasgow face a number of different barriers in accessing health services which can help them with their addiction, and that current methods are falling short of offering the appropriate level of support. For this reason, Glasgow City Health and Social Care Partnership, and other parties, have developed innovative plans for the implementation of a Safe Injecting Facility.\n“It is imperative that the Home Office consider this request – which has cross-party support from a number of Scottish MPs – to allow an SDCF to be trialled in Glasgow. This issue has become a serious public health issue, and it is our collective responsibility to ensure that we do what we can to improve the situation not just for drug users, but for the wider public in general”.",
  "http_www_alisonthewliss_scot/https_www_alisonthewliss_scot_alison-thewliss-mp-urges-households-to-keep-a-step-ahead-of-winter/content_535.html": "New research from Scottish Gas has highlighted that having no heating or hot water would be the number one disaster for households in Scotland this winter. Even so, many people in Glasgow have not taken action to ensure their homes are winter-ready.\nDespite the autumn chill, a national survey* shows that more than a third of households (35%) in Scotland have not checked that their central heating is working and nearly four in ten have not prepared their home for winter by getting their boiler serviced. Having an annual boiler service carried out by a Gas Safe registered engineer is crucial as it detects problems with the boiler and controls, including whether it is leaking poisonous carbon monoxide.\nKeeping homes safe is an important part of winter preparation, yet only four in ten households in Scotland have checked that their carbon monoxide alarm is working. Carbon monoxide is known as the ‘silent killer’, because the gas has no odour or taste, and is invisible. Fitting an audible alarm is the second line of defence against carbon monoxide poisoning.\nBeing energy efficient is particularly important during the winter months, and technology can help with this. Whilst more than half of households in Scotland (51%) acknowledge that technology could help their home to run more smoothly during winter, less than a third (32%) have smart meters.\nHaving smart meters installed can help keep household energy in check, as they automatically send readings to the energy supplier. Smart meters also come with a display that shows you how much energy is being used, in pounds and pence, in near real-time, and identify where savings can be made.\nAlison Thewliss MP said: “It’s really important to keep a step ahead of winter. I want everyone in Glasgow to understand what help is available for them, and for their family and friends. Being energy efficient and keeping bills under control is really important, so I’d encourage people to get in touch with their energy supplier to find out what support is on offer.”\nScottish Gas engineer Stephen Cosgrove, who fixes and repairs boilers, said: “Winter can be a challenging time for households, but there are some practical steps that you can take, with our help, to make sure that you are prepared:\nGet the best deal\nWe have been working hard to ensure buying energy is simple, transparent and fair for customers – for every customer on a standard variable tariff they will get an Annual Energy Health Check to make sure they’re on the right tariff. This will highlight other ways we can help our customers save money like replacing old and inefficient boilers or insulating their homes for free.\nGet smart meters\nYour energy supplier will be able to install smart meters, which mean an end to estimated bills. A smart energy monitor shows how much energy you are using, and what you are spending. Scottish Gas customers are provided with online tools to help them manage their energy usage. Find out more by visiting www.britishgas.co.uk/smartmeters\nThe Scottish Gas Energy Trust\nThis independent trust gives face-to-face advice, financial support and grants to help clear energy and household debts. The average grant is around £600 and you don’t have to be a Scottish Gas customer. Find out more by visiting: www.britishgasenergytrust.org.uk.\nBleed your radiators: to make sure they are working properly. If your radiators have cold spots at the top, this means you have air in the system, so you will need to bleed them to get them working efficiently.\na. To do this, turn the system off and when cool turn the radiator key until the air stops and water runs consistently. Once you have turned the system back on, the problem should be solved.\nb. Cold spots in the bottom or centre of the radiator may be an indication of sludge build up and the need for system flushing.\nc. Bleeding your radiator may result in pressure dropping. If you have a pressure gauge, make sure the boiler is at the right pressure and top up as necessary.\nBlock the breeze: Make sure all of your windows and doors seal properly to stop warm air escaping. For those that don’t, fitting draught excluders, which you can buy from most DIY stores, is a quick and cheap way to cut down on your energy bills.\nStay safe: It’s vital to have a carbon monoxide alarm fitted and that you test it regularly.\nLove your boiler: Check to make sure that your boiler is working properly before winter sets in. The older your boiler, the more inefficient it will be. If you have a pressure gauge, make sure the boiler is at the right pressure and top up as necessary.\nInsulate your pipes: Burst pipes are a huge issue during winter months. To help prevent burst pipes, ensure all pipes are properly insulated by using lagging, which can be bought cheaply from most DIY shops.\nMaintain your drains: If you’re trying to keep your drains outside well maintained, it’s a good idea to make sure they are clear of debris at the point at which they enter the ground. This involves checking your gullies for autumnal leaves and twigs in order to ensure that they don’t restrict water flow at any point.\nControl your heating remotely with Hive Active Heating: Using Hive Active Heating means you can control your heating and hot water remotely from your smartphone with the Hive app, so you can ensure your home is warm when you need it to be.

She heard about the work that is still to be done to stop the disease in its tracks, as there is no cure for Parkinson’s and current medication can’t stop the condition from progressing.\nMs Thewliss heard how important it is that people with Parkinson’s disease get the right financial support to help with the extra costs of living with the condition. Shockingly, 25 per cent of people with Parkinson’s are losing some or all of this support as they are moved from Disability Living Allowance to the replacement benefit Personal Independence Payment, leaving people unable to pay for aids and adaptations, energy bills and transport.\nParkinson’s affects 1 in 500 people in Glasgow Central, and can cause a myriad of symptoms including insomnia, depression, and hallucinations, robbing people of their independence.

She needs regular assistance to manage her condition, which currently qualifies her for Disability Living Allowance but not for Personal Independence Payment. She stands to lose £110 a week as a result of the UK Government’s planned transition from DLA to PIP.\nIn March 2017, the UK Government brought in a change to the eligibility criteria to Personal Independence Payment, in light of a tribunal rulings which stated that people who required supervision to take medication for a long-term health condition should be awarded more points in the PIP assessment.\nThe change is estimated to deny at least 2,000 people with long-term mental health conditions access to Personal Independence Payment, according to figures provided by the DWP’s own Equality Impact Assessment – around 1.2% of the total number of people who claim PIP.\nMs Thewliss has written to the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions to ask for an urgent review of the PIP criteria, to ensure that people who require long-term monitoring of medical conditions can continue to receive the support they need.\nSpeaking after Prime Minister’s Questions, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“The denial of PIP to my constituent demonstrates the real human cost of the Tories’ callous austerity agenda. My constituent, and many like her, have been placed in a very difficult position because of the Tories’ obsession with cutting social security for some of the most vulnerable people in society.\n“When changes to the PIP criteria were introduced in March 2017, the Government’s own assessments indicated that a small, specific group of people with long-term mental health conditions would lose out on crucial financial support. The Government ignored the warnings given and decided to press ahead with targeting some of the most vulnerable people in society.\n“The Prime Minister’s promises of radical action on mental health are ringing hollow today. If Theresa May is serious about supporting people with serious mental health conditions, she must act to reverse the changes to PIP immediately.”",

That they wanted this callous policy to be buried speaks volumes in itself.\n“Women across the world have been marching this weekend in solidarity with America, whilst here in the UK, the Westminster Government ploughs ahead to undermine women’s rights.\n“Obviously I am pleased that the UK Government has made a number of concessions, which will go some way to reducing some of the cruellest aspects associated with this pernicious proposal.\n“I particularly welcome the u-turn on multiple births and that there will be no time limit on the reporting of rape. What is also encouraging is the decision to remove frontline DWP and HMRC staff from gatekeeping on this incredibly sensitive process. However, there are still fundamental problems with this pernicious two-child policy, not least concerning those of faith and ethnic minority backgrounds.\n“The UK Government’s own response clearly identifies that the most controversial aspect of the policy was the rape clause. Ministers even go on to concede that most respondents felt it was unacceptable for the UK Government to ask women to re-live the ordeal of a rape just in order to make a claim for benefit. Despite receiving that loud and overwhelming message, this appalling and crass Tory Government refuse to listen.\n“The fact remains that this policy, however diluted, is still anti-women, anti-family and fundamentally wicked.\n“There are still a number of very serious unanswered questions about the practicalities of a policy due to be implemented in just a few months’ time. I’ll be using this crucial time to fight these proposals all the way, particularly when they come to the House as a statutory instrument.”",

The statement was released shortly after the responses to the Government’s consultation on the closure of the JobCentre were published, which demonstrated significant opposition to the closure proposals. 64% of the responses expressed concerns that local services in Bridgeton would suffer as a result of closing Bridgeton JobCentre and that jobseekers would find it more difficult to make ends meet due to increased travel costs to other JobCentres.\nGlasgow has been targeted disproportionate cuts to DWP offices, with over 50% of the DWP estate, including JobCentres and support offices, earmarked for closure by the UK Government. Local Jobseekers will now need to travel over three miles to attend appointments at Shettleston JobCentre – something that 79% of consultation responses highlighted as a concern in their submissions to the Government’s own consultation.\nThe decision will also put considerable pressure on JobCentre staff – the full extent of which is unclear as Ministers have previously admitted, in responses to written questions tabled by Ms Thewliss, that they do not know how many people currently use Bridgeton JobCentre.\nCommenting on the decision, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“The UK Government’s decision to close Bridgeton JobCentre is yet another slap in the face to the East End of Glasgow. For constituents who are already struggling, paying bus fares to get to mandatory JobCentre appointments will be an extra burden. Increased travel times will also put people at increased risk of falling foul of the Tories’ brutal sanctions regime.\n“Ministers have admitted that they have no idea how many people rely on Bridgeton JobCentre, and not a single Minister visited Bridgeton JobCentre before the decision was taken to close it. Now they have decided to ignore the results of the consultation and sneak out a written statement on the closures, denying MPs an opportunity to hold Ministers to account in Parliament.\n“Today’s callous decision shows that the Tories will continue to treat the people of Glasgow with contempt. I will be making every effort to bring Ministers to the despatch box to account for this poorly thought out and ill-informed decision and explain why they have not listened to the overwhelming evidence presented in their own consultation.”",

Ms Thewliss tabled a series of parliamentary questions. The response, issued by the National Statistician’s Office suggest that over 100,000 people in Scotland still earn below the minimum wage.\nCommenting on the data, Glasgow Central MP Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“These figures shine a very bright light on the UK Government’s awful record on pay and more specifically, pay inequality.\n“One of the main reasons cited for increased food bank usage – in addition to benefit sanctions – is low pay which is absolutely scandalous for twenty first century Britain. It is perhaps one of the clearest signs that we are not all in this together and people aren’t benefiting from the UK continuing to have decision making powers over pay.\n“So often we hear this UK Government’s much coveted long term economic plan, but it’s not working if tens of thousands of people aren’t even being paid a minimum wage, let alone a living wage.\n“Serious questions need to be asked about how, 18 years on from minimum wage legislation being introduced, so many people are still being exploited and let down by this Government.\n“One of things these figures reveal is that young people in particular lose out big time. The SNP is clear – we believe that pay shouldn’t be based on your age. That is discriminatory and we will resist any moves, particularly with the new con trick that is the UK Government’s living wage, to further penalise young people with their pay slips.”",

In total, more than half a million people are currently on the Anthony Nolan register and the average per constituency is 905.\nNow Alison Thewliss is encouraging more 16 to 30-year-olds to sign up. She says it is particularly important that young men and people from ethnic minorities join the register as they are currently under-represented.\nThe blood cancer charity Anthony Nolan created the world’s first stem cell donor register, and has been saving lives for over four decades by matching remarkable people willing to donate their bone marrow or stem cells to patients in desperate need of a transplant. It also carries out pioneering research to increase stem cell transplant success, and supports patients through their transplant journeys.\nTwo thirds of UK patients will not find a matching donor from within their families; instead they turn to Anthony Nolan to find them an unrelated donor.\nAnthony Nolan wants to give people the very best chance of life by finding the best possible match for them. But the charity can currently only find a perfect match for 60 per cent of transplant recipients, so they still urgently need more people to come forward.\nMs Thewliss said:\n“I am delighted that 1379 people in Glasgow Central constituency are registered on the Anthony Nolan stem cell register. It is fantastic to see that there are so many heroic and selfless people in my constituency.\n“I hope that more local people will also now be inspired to sign up and to become potential lifesavers for people in desperate need.”\nAnn O’Leary, Head of Register Development at Anthony Nolan, said:\n‘We are delighted that Alison Thewliss has been inspired to encourage others to sign up as donors. Donating is an incredibly selfless thing to do and will give someone with blood cancer the best possible chance of survival. What many people don’t realise is that it is also surprisingly simple.’\nTo join the Anthony Nolan register you must be 16-30 and in good health. It involves filling out a simple online form and spitting into a tube. About 90% of people who are asked to donate will do so through a process similar to giving blood.\nThe charity needs supporters of all ages to champion the register at a local level and help us spread the word – from schools, communities and workplaces to your own friends and family.

Speaking in her capacity as the chair of the APPG on Infant Feeding, Thewliss has urged the Government to listen to the concerns of the APPG and end exploitative marketing in the UK. Thewliss has been a champion for new policies that encourage breastfeeding, such as encouraging football clubs across Scotland to declare their stadiums breastfeeding friendly.

We know that our children are eating too much sugar, with their main source being sugar sweetened soft drinks which is contributing to more than one third of our kids being overweight or obese by the time they leave primary school. Added to this children from deprived areas of the UK are twice as likely to be overweight or obese as their counterparts from less deprived areas, whilst more likely to consume sugar sweetened soft drinks.\nObese children are five times more likely to become obese adults, increasing their risk of developing serious health conditions like type 2 diabetes, cancer, liver and cardiovascular disease and associated mental health problems. Obesity also currently costs the NHS at least £6billion a year.\nAlison Thewliss MP said: “We have a childhood obesity crisis in this country. It’s unbelievable how much sugar is in many of the drinks our children regularly consume. These drinks easily become part of their regular diet and usually have no nutritional value so just end up being empty calories.\n“This is why the Soft Drinks Industry Levy is so important. Decreasing the amount of sugar in these beverages will contribute towards making our children healthier now, and in the future.”\nProfessor John Wass from the Obesity Health Alliance said: “Our children are consuming too much sugar and soft drinks are their number one source of sugar. “The case for the soft drinks industry levy, coupled with the reformulation of soft drinks to reduce their sugar content, has never been clearer. The nation’s diet needs to be unsweetened – and fast.”",

The questionnaire focussed on maternal nutrition, breastfeeding, infant feeding and related health behaviours.\nThe survey pointed to progress being made in many areas, with 43% of mothers now continuing to breastfeed up to six months after birth, compared with 32% in 2010. In addition, it spoke to an increase in the overall duration of breastfeeding.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“It is greatly encouraging to see an uplift in the number of mothers who are breastfeeding for longer, and I am delighted that this increase is a significant one. It’s important to recognise the work going on in hospitals and local areas by both health professionals and volunteer peer supporters, as this couldn’t be achieved without their incredible efforts.\n“The Unicef UK Baby Friendly Initiative standards recommend that, in order to maximise health outcomes for children, breastfeeding should be promoted exclusively for the first six months. In that sense, it’s terrific to see so many women in Scotland maximising breastmilk and introducing solid foods later.\n“I know there is still a lot of work to be done in this area. Whilst help and information is given to mothers to promote and assist with breastfeeding, the survey results show the main reasons for breastfeeding ceasing early is due to concerns around feeding problems, and also finding feeding too difficult. It’s therefore crucial that health professionals continue to provide and develop ongoing support.\n“Studies such as this are fundamental, as they provide an evidence base on which more informed policy decisions can be made, in this case to help design and implement better advice and support for families. It’s crucial that the UK Government do the same, in order to improve health outcomes across the country”.",

That’s more than 1,900 acres of land – 25% of the Glasgow area as a whole.\nProtecting our parks and green spaces is of paramount importance to the health and wellbeing of the city of Glasgow, and many of these themes are picked up in the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) report State of UK Public Parks 2016.\nThe report notes that, even in challenging economic times, where funding for projects and services is being squeezed across all areas of government, regenerating parks enjoys widespread support, with 57% of adults using their local parks at least once a month or more.\nThe Communities and Local Government Committee, of which I am a member, wants to expand on this with our inquiry into public parks across the UK. We want to hear the views of everyone across the UK about the state of their public parks and how they can be improved. Write to us by Friday 30 September to ensure your voice is heard: contact details are on the Parliament website.\nHaving a say\nThe HLF report also notes that the management of parks will increasingly vary as local authorities seek to make savings through the disposal of land and other assets.\nI am clear that this disposal should not be done to satisfy the commercial interests of larger companies, but instead should involve communities at every stage of the parks management process.\nThe Scottish Government’s Community Empowerment Act gives communities powers to purchase surplus assets and request participation in the management and running of community assets. This means they can have the opportunity to exert greater control over their own neighbourhoods and green spaces.\nWith financial backing of the Scottish Land Fund, which supports bids for community purchase of assets, we can address some of the points made about the diversification of management in a bottom-up, community-led fashion.\nGlasgow Green\nCommunity budgeting can also play a role here and there are many successful pilot projects across Glasgow where communities have been able to decide spending priorities for services in their area, including on the creation and management of parks and green spaces.\nIn my own constituency of Glasgow Central I am delighted to have Glasgow Green, the oldest public park, containing the iconic Doulton Fountain, McLennan Arch, People’s Palace and Winter Garden. The park has benefited from over £8million of HLF support for restoration works, and from community groups who support the park’s heritage and development.\nAlongside HLF support, the Friends of Glasgow Green continue to come up with new and innovative uses for the space. In particular, I want to take this opportunity to congratulate Trisha Ingram, Chair of Friends of Glasgow Green and their members and supporters in taking the first steps to raise funds for an outdoor gym in Glasgow Green, which seeks to replace the original equipment which was donated to the park in 1860.\nThey have already raised £12,000 for the new facility and are hoping to double that amount through a crowdfunding campaign.\nMore generally, Glasgow Green benefits from being part of the MyParkScotland network, which helps people to find out what’s going on in their local park. This was one of Nesta’s HLF-supported 11 Rethinking Parks projects. Through the MyParkScotland network Glasgow Green benefits from the chance to donate securely to individual park projects. I would encourage local authorities and independent park trusts across the UK to adopt this feature when planning and managing the financial resources of green spaces.\nCitizen satisfaction\nIt’s clear from the conclusions of the report that, when local authorities and communities are both invested in protecting and maintaining our green spaces, the payoff in terms of citizen satisfaction with public parks and park quality is significant.\nIt’s also clear that, when parks are prioritised by local authorities, citizens and other stakeholders, cities become better and healthier places to live. If cities across the UK are to retain high quality public parks, then we must give communities the opportunity and autonomy to nurture and protect the green spaces they care about, and I pledge to be an “elected champion” for parks and green spaces in my constituency.\nWhile there is a lot of work to do to ensure that park maintenance and quality remains of a high standard, I am confident that Glasgow will continue to live up to its name of “dear green place” for many years to come.",

Hospitals, schools, and humanitarian workers must never be a target in conflict. I support the immediate release of the hostages taken by Hamas following their brutal attack on the 7th of October.\nI have signed the following cross-party Early Day Motion in Parliament: https://edm.parliament.uk/early-day-motion/61468\nThe SNP have led calls for a ceasefire, with First Minister Humza Yousaf MSP reiterating this view in recent days: https://x.com/HumzaYousaf/status/1721589735204749522?s=20\nMy SNP colleagues and I have tabled the following amendment to the King’s Speech, which will most likely be voted on in Parliament on today, Wednesday 15th November.\nAmendment (h):\nAt end add ‘but respectfully regret that the Gracious Speech fails to include measures that would require the Government to uphold international law and protect all civilians in Israel and Palestine; unequivocally condemn the horrific killings by Hamas and the taking of hostages; reaffirm that there must be an end to the collective punishment of the Palestinian people; call for the urgent release of all hostages and an end to the siege of Gaza to allow vital supplies of food, fuel, medicine and water to reach the civilian population; note the growing calls for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire from the United Nations and its aid agencies; and therefore call on the Government to join with the international community in urgently pressing all parties to agree to an immediate ceasefire.’\nGiven the very grave humanitarian situation in Gaza, I was glad to see the Scottish Government has pledged £750,000 to UNRWA. This is an important commitment, but it only goes a small way to help those in need. There is a need for the international community to do more to commit to support those desperately in need, and also for routes to be established to allow that aid to get in to Gaza. It cannot be right that the Secretary General of the United Nations has had to go to the Rafah crossing and plead for aid trucks to be allowed in.\nI fully support the investigation of all war crimes, and believe that those who have perpetrated such acts must be held to account.\nI am deeply concerned about the continued supply of arms to Israel.

These past few months have been a real worry for my family and to have this bill reduced will make a huge difference to our lives.\n“This student exemption is such a crucial thing to have until the end of September and has lifted a huge weight off my family’s shoulders.\n“When I contacted the office of Alison Thewliss, I really was at my wits’ end.

My thoughts are with everyone who has lost a loved one to drugs.\n“This reduction in deaths should serve as a catalyst for even greater efforts to provide assistance and opportunities for recovery to those who need it most. The root causes of substance abuse, such as poverty, homelessness, and lack of access to education and employment have been exacerbated by over a decade of austerity.\n“It is not acceptable for the UK Government to sit on their hands and block efforts to provide harm reduction initiatives such as safe consumption facilities in Glasgow. The Misuse of Drugs Act must be urgently reviewed, as it is a barrier to saving lives and tackling the harms associated with drug use.\n“The stigma associated with drug use not only prevents individuals from seeking help but also causes a cycle of shame and isolation. By treating people who use drugs with compassion and respect, we can create an environment where they feel safe to reach out for support.\n“Recovery communities have made a significant contribution, building a network of grassroots support. The Scottish Government’s public health approach rightly focuses on providing accessible and effective treatment options, harm reduction strategies, and mental health services. Increasing the availability of life-saving Naloxone treatment has saved lives, and I would encourage more people to get trained on how to use it.\n“I firmly support the Scottish Government’s proposals to decriminalise drugs for personal use. We must learn from good practice around the world; nothing should be off the table for tackling this issue which has already cost so many lives and devastated so many families.”\nBank of Scotland Response – Albert Drive Closure\nAs my constituents may be aware, the Bank of Scotland branch on Albert Drive closed on the 27th July this year. After being contacted by a number of my constituents with concerns about this closure, I was able to raise these concerns directly with Bank of Scotland.\nPlease find Bank of Scotland’s response to my query about the Albert Drive branch closure below:\n“I understand that the closure of our Bank of Scotland branch in Pollokshields last month was disappointing for some members of the community.\n“We never take the decision to close any branch lightly. In this instance, the decision, was based on careful analysis of the usage of the branch over the last few years.\n“Before we made the announcement, we carefully considered the impact closing the branch would have on our customers. Our team visited the community to see for themselves the impact that closing the branch would have, looked at the alternative banking options available, and assessed the availability of public transport to get to the closest alternative branch.\n“We also looked at all information available to us – including the ways customers are choosing to bank with us, the number of vulnerable people in the local area, and the accessibility of alternative banking facilities including the Post Office. After carrying out this assessment, we only went ahead once we were satisfied there are suitable alternatives and sufficient access to cash locally.\n“As part of the industry-wide Cash Action Group process, LINK also independently reviewed overall cash provision in Pollokshields prior to our announcement being made. Given the alternatives available, they did not recommend any additional services.\n“Over the last five years, the number of transactions in our Pollokshields branch had continued to fall. The decline in transactions reflects wider trends across the industry, as people choose to use branches less often – accessing services over the telephone or online, or via the Post Office. The majority of our customers now choose to bank with us in more than one way. For example, 83 per cent of our personal customers at Pollokshields branch were already using other branches and other ways to bank such as Internet and Telephone Banking.\n“Our Bank of Scotland Glasgow Victoria Road branch is less than one mile away and there are regular direct trains to Victoria Road with a journey time of 5 minutes. Our Glasgow Shawlands branch is a little over one mile away and takes around 10 minutes to travel to on the bus. Currently both Glasgow Victoria Road branch and Glasgow Shawlands have extended opening hours in comparison to Pollokshields branch giving customers more convenience when they choose to visit the branch.\n“Through our commercial arrangement with the Post Office, all Bank of Scotland customers can withdraw and deposit cash for free over the counter, and pay in cheques, at any branch of the Post Office.\n“There are also other alternatives in the community including a number of free-to-use cash machines in the area, including three within 0.5 miles at Day Today, Kenmure Street, Friends Convenience Store, Pollokshaws Road, and Sainsbury’s, Darnley Road.\n“People can also use telephone banking or our online services. This means that for many of the day-to-day transactions required by our customers in Pollokshields, there is no need to travel to an alternative Bank of Scotland branch. Many customers find the ease of these alternatives to be preferable to travelling to and from a branch. For those looking to open a bank account, or apply for a loan or a mortgage, applications can be made online, or by phone. For those customers wanting to talk to a mortgage adviser face to face and from a place that suits them, our video call service could be the perfect option. More details can be found on our website.\n“You can be assured that branch staff talked to customers about the service the local Post Office offers and helped those who wished to learn about how to use online and telephone banking. Prior to the closure branch staff contacted vulnerable customers to help them understand the options available to them and supported them through the transition. We understand that some older customers may have concerns about banking online, although only 7 per cent of customers who used the Pollokshields branch are aged 75 plus. We also have a ‘Digital Helpline’ which offers free one-to-one guidance over the phone to support customers using the Internet for banking. Customers with an identified need for this service were provided with contact details, enabling them to get free support if required. We will also supply a free tablet and SIM card with data in cases where people cannot afford to go online.\n“Our online banking provides a variety of tools for managing a customer’s money. If customers are apprehensive about using this, we have a section on our website with a step-by-step guide, showing how they can get set up. We also have a section that explains how customers can protect themselves online. Further details can be found on our website here.\n“We also try to make sure banking is easy for people of all abilities and needs. Customers who have a disability or impairment or would just like extra help can find out more information about the ways we can support them by discussing things with local branch staff or by visiting our website here.”\nTHEWLISS BACKS SCOTTISH GOVERNMENT PROPOSALS FOR DECRIMINALISATION OF ALL DRUGS FOR PERSONAL USE\nAlison Thewliss, the Member of Parliament for Glasgow Central, has backed calls by the Scottish Government for the decriminalisation of all drugs for personal use.\nMinisters in Scotland have called on the UK Government to agree to proposals.\nDrug laws are currently reserved to Westminster.\nSpeaking at a press conference on Friday, Scotland’s drugs policy minister Elena Whitham called for a public health approach to tackling the drugs crisis.\nShe said discrimination would mean people found in possession of drugs were “treated and supported rather than criminalised and excluded”.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said\n“I am pleased to see the Scottish Government taking a bold step towards addressing the complex issue of drug use by proposing the decriminalisation of all drugs for personal use. This approach recognises that addiction is primarily a health issue and should be treated as such, rather than as a criminal matter.\n“Decades of evidence and international experiences have shown that punitive approaches to drug use have not been successful in reducing drug-related harms. Instead, they have perpetuated a cycle of criminalisation, stigmatisation, and marginalisation, leading to devastating consequences for individuals and communities.\n“By decriminalising drug use, we can shift the focus towards harm reduction, rehabilitation, and support services. This approach will enable individuals struggling with drug addiction to seek the help they need without fear of criminal repercussions. It opens up the possibility of treating addiction as a public health issue, offering individuals a chance to recover and reintegrate into society.\n“I commend the Scottish Government for their progressive stance and for prioritising the health and well-being of individuals affected by drug addiction. For too long, my constituents have been suffering at the hands of these restrictive policies for drug users. It is high time that this UK Tory Government take action to support people all across these Isles through a renewed approach to drug use.”\nTHEWLISS CHALLENGES ROBERT JENRICK OVER FALSE CLAIMS THAT SCOTLAND DO NOT TAKE IN REFUGEES\nAlison Thewliss, Member of Parliament for Glasgow Central, has challenged the Minister of State for Immigration, Robert Jenrick following a clash in the House of Commons.\nThe Minister falsely claimed that no refugees attended the Refugee Festival Scotland, with Jenrick accusing Scotland of not taking in any refugees.\nRobert Jenrick was questioned in the Commons today over the economic impact of the Government’s Rwanda policy.\nIt has been estimated that it will cost £169,000 per person to deport asylum seekers to the African nation.\nAlison Thewliss MP said:\n“The Minister of State for Immigration is a complete and utter disgrace. His false claims in the Commons today only emphasises what we have all known about this UK Tory Government; they have no shame and cannot be trusted to tell the truth.\n“The Conservative Illegal Migration Bill would be an effective ban on people seeking sanctuary, against all the UK’s international obligations. It is also a colossal waste of public money in a cost of living crisis.\n“Scotland’s commitment to welcoming refugees is a testament to our compassion and solidarity. Asylum seekers and refugees must be embraced, respected, and given the opportunity to thrive and rebuild their lives.\n“Refugee Week provided a unique opportunity to celebrate the contributions of refugees to our society and to raise awareness about the challenges they face. Refugee Week showcased a range of inspiring events and initiatives that foster understanding, promote integration, and challenge misconceptions about refugees.\n“In Scotland, we say it loud and we say it clear: refugees are welcome here.”\nAlison Thewliss Letter to Rishi Sunak on Robert Jenrick\nDear Rishi,\nI am writing to you in your capacity as arbiter of conduct of Ministers.\nI wish to highlight the conduct of the Minister for Immigration, Robert Jenrick MP in the House of Commons chamber on 27th June. Mr Jenrick made the claim that no refugees are housed in Scotland, and a further claim that no asylum seekers are housed in Scotland. Given the opportunity to correct this demonstrably false statement on the record, he declined.\nThis conduct is of the utmost seriousness. The UK Government’s ministerial code states: “It is of paramount importance that ministers give accurate and truthful information to parliament, correcting any inadvertent error at the earliest opportunity. Ministers who knowingly mislead parliament will be expected to offer their resignation to the Prime Minister.”\nHome Office data from 2020 to 2021 published last year showed Scotland took in around 13% of all refugees resettled in the UK during that period – well above our proportion of the UK’s population of 8%.\nThe Home Office’s most recent quarterly figures show Glasgow remains the local authority with the most dispersed asylum seekers (70 per 10,000 residents), followed by Birmingham (17 per 10,000), and Hillingdon (18 per 10,000).\nScotland has also taken in 20% of all Ukrainian arrivals under the Homes for Ukrainian scheme and the Scottish Government Super Sponsor scheme.\nFollowing the crisis in Syria in 2015, Scottish local authorities welcomed asylum seekers and by early 2020 there were over 3500 individuals in all 32 of Scotland’s local authority areas, under the Syrian Resettlement programme and the Vulnerable Children’s Resettlement Scheme.\nMr Jenrick’s conduct has not only breached the Ministerial Code, but caused great offence to communities in Scotland.\nThe Scottish Refugee Council were unequivocal in their condemnation of Mr Jenrick’s actions:\n“We are truly shocked by the wild inaccuracies shared here by immigration minister Robert Jenrick. The minister is either knowingly lying or is not aware that Scotland welcomes thousands of people seeking sanctuary each year. We are not sure which is more concerning. With the proposal of the inhumane Illegal Migration Bill and the increase in far-right rhetoric, including from the UK government, it is vital that we call out these blatant falsehoods.”\nI urge you to consider the Minister’s position.\nTHEWLISS URGES URGENT RECONSIDERATION OF BANK OF SCOTLAND CLOSURE\nREPORT SHOWS 4 IN 10 OLDER PEOPLE ARE NOT MANAGING THEIR MONEY ONLINE\nAlison Thewliss, Member of Parliament for Glasgow Central, has called on an urgent reconsideration of the closure of Bank of Scotland on Albert Drive following new findings on online banking.\nAge UK’s new report ‘You can’t bank on it anymore’, which looks at the effect of rising online banking on older people, has found that 4 in 10 older people with a bank account in Britain are not managing their money online and could be at high risk of financial exclusion.\nThe polling also found that three-quarters (75 per cent) of over-65s with a bank account – equivalent to 7.86 million people – wish to undertake at least one banking task in person at a bank branch, building society or Post Office.\nNearly a third of older people with a bank account (31 per cent) – equivalent to 3.25 million people – have also been found to feel uncomfortable with online banking.\nWith these new findings, Alison Thewliss MP has called on an urgent review ahead of the proposed closure of Bank of Scotland’s Albert Drive branch.\nThe Albert Drive branch is set to close on the 27th July.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“These new findings by Age UK show the impact the closure of the Bank of Scotland branch on Albert Drive will have on older people in Pollokshields.\n“In-person banking continues to be important to many of my constituents, and the removal of access to cash in their local area remains extremely unfair.\n“While online banking becomes a key part of society, we must not forget those unable to participate. Those who wish to attend their local branch should have the option – instead of being completely left in limbo.\n“I ask that Bank of Scotland reconsider the decision to close the Albert Drive branch to ensure that my constituents continue to have access to the full range of banking services in their own neighbourhood.”\nTHEWLISS URGES CONSTITUENTS TO REDEEM ENERGY SUPPORT VOUCHERS\n43% OF VOUCHERS LEFT UNCLAIMED IN GLASGOW CENTRAL\nAlison Thewliss, Member of Parliament for Glasgow Central, has urged constituents to redeem their prepayment meter vouchers issued to households.\nNew stats released by the Government found that 17,760 (57%) of prepayment meter vouchers were redeemed.\nThis means that 43% of these vouchers have been left unclaimed by Glasgow Central constituents.\nIn October and November, vouchers were valued at £66 – with December and January’s being valued at £67.\nWith these values, the 13,450 unredeemed vouchers have a value of at least £887,700.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“If you are on a traditional prepayment meter, you should be getting £66 or £67 vouchers each month. This is an entitlement which a large amount of my constituents have not redeemed.\n“In this cost-of-living crisis, any additional money during these difficult times could make a massive difference to people’s lives.\n“If you are using a traditional prepayment meter and have not received any of the monthly vouchers through the post, or by email or text message, you can contact your energy supplier to enquire about this payment. This must be done before the 1st June to ensure you are eligible for the payment.\n“If any Glasgow Central constituents are in need of support for this payment, please do not hesitate to contact my office via email: alison.thewliss.mp@parliament.uk, or via phone call: 0141 552 7117. My team are always more than happy to help with any constituent issues and urge any constituent to contact my team.”\nCONSTITUENT ENDS LONGSTANDING ISSUE WITH OPENREACH\nGLASGOW CENTRAL MP THANKS CONSTITUENT FOR THEIR PATIENCE\nA Glasgow Central constituent has ended a longstanding dispute with Openreach after contacting their local MP.\nThe constituent contacted the office of Alison Thewliss MP in February of 2022, highlighting issues with potholes in the Govan area.\nWith the number of potholes and the constant bouncing of buses and trucks on these broken roads, the constituent’s home was experiencing a large amount of vibrations – causing difficulties with sleep.\nAfter dialogue with Glasgow City Council, it was highlighted that it would be Openreach who would need to deal with the case.\nA box which was installed by Openreach was also seen to be causing a large amount of noise in the area, which the constituent highlighted in her emails to the office.\nWith the support of Alison Thewliss MP, the constituent was able to highlight the key areas which were causing the most amount of problems.\nOpenreach contacted the office of Alison Thewliss MP and the constituent to confirm that the works would be completed on the 1st March, ending the longstanding issues faced over the past year.\nAfter confirmation from Openreach that the works had been completed, the constituent contacted the office of Alison Thewliss MP to extend her thanks for the support.\nCommenting, the constituent said:\n“I am so relieved to have these issues resolved. I have faced a year of difficulties, and it is great to be able to live in the comfort of my own home without the worry of not being able to have a good sleep.\n“I can’t thank Alison and her team enough for the support they have given me in this case. The patience and dedication shown by the team is something which I am extremely grateful for.\n“It has been a long time since this case was started with Alison’s team, and I am delighted to see it has finally been resolved.”\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“I am delighted to see this case has been resolved with the constituent. This case has been going on for more than a year, and I can’t begin to imagine how difficult the past year must have been.\n“While my team were in touch with Openreach, my constituent has been so patient and understood the issues we faced in this case.\n“I also want to extend a thanks to the Openreach, who were also very helpful in this issue and were in regular dialogue with my team about this case.\n“As mentioned by the constituent, it will be such a relief to be able to live in their home without worry, and I hope this will make a massive difference to their life.\n“If any Glasgow Central constituents have issues they wish to raise, please do not hesitate to contact my office via email: alison.thewliss.mp@parliament.uk, or via phone call: 0141 552 7117.

However, upon further questioning by using a device known as ‘pursuant questions’, it was revealed that the main civil servants’ union has been shut out by the Government.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP – who has been leading the campaign against the rape clause and two child policy – said:\n“The more this policy is scrutinised, the more flaws we find. The DWP seemed to think sneaking this out to a quick public consultation would be another box ticked and they could plough ahead with their medieval rape clause and pernicious two child policy.\n“Momentum is growing ever more amongst a cross-party group of MPs, trade unions, faith communities and third sector groups who are all united in rejecting this appalling policy.”\nChris Stephens MP, who is Chair of the Parliamentary PCS Group, added:\n“This Government has been caught trying to bluff their way through answers to written parliamentary questions. It beggars belief that this Tory Government announced plans to bring forward a rape clause over 500 days ago, yet it hasn’t stopped to pick up the phone to trade unions and seek their views. Aside from the utter barbarism of asking women to prove they were raped to receive benefits, it would also put DWP civil servants in an incredibly awkward position. Staff need specific training on this deeply sensitive issue.\n“The public consultation might be closed but it is imperative that the Government acts without delay and invites the views of all trade unions and staff within the DWP who would also be affected by this monstrous policy”.",

The decision was met with widespread, cross-party condemnation, with many MPs commenting that closures would place an additional burden on those already struggling to make ends meet.\nIn a passionate plea during Prime Minister’s Questions, the SNP MP noted that a constituent of hers who is 58, has a variety of serious health concerns, and was only recently discharged from hospital, attended Bridgeton JobCentre on Tuesday, only to find it was closed. Ms Thewliss asked the Prime Minister to apologise to her constituent for not having made her aware of the JobCentre’s closure, and to refund her taxi fare.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“This situation really is absurd. Not only are my constituents who previously used Bridgeton JobCentre expected to travel to alternative locations to attend mandatory appointments, it appears that the government hasn’t even told them that their local JobCentre has closed.\n“Unfortunately, whilst shocking, the case I raised during PMQs will not be unique. People will be turning up to JobCentres across Glasgow to find out for the first time that their local service no longer exists.\n“The DWP holds extensive details of every claimant: they should take responsibility for their actions and write to everyone on their database to inform them about the closures.\n“Surely the government must see what a shambles this whole process has been. My constituent, and scores of others like her, at the very least deserve an apology for the appalling way they have been treated. I will be writing to the Department for Work and Pensions to urge them to do so”.",

However, firms expect prices to rise significantly, even with the mitigation package, and many expect an extremely challenging winter. Food and drink, tourism and hospitality businesses have all struggled over the course of the pandemic, and astronomical energy bills will be the final straw for some. Commenting, Alison Thewliss MP said: “The UK Government has come up short once again in their support for businesses across the country. As has been the case throughout this crisis, new measures have been introduced which are simply not enough – while businesses continue to beg for more support. While the six-month support package may help in the short term, the long-term worry for businesses remain. “I met with several businesses in the Glasgow Central constituency during recess, who spoke to me of their concerns about the months ahead. They felt as though they are being forgotten about and left to fend for themselves in these darkest of times. The cost of the energy crisis comes on top of increased material costs, supply chain issues and labour shortages. “One business in Dalmarnock, Calder Millerfield spoke to me of their profound worry for the year ahead – with soaring energy bills hitting them extremely hard. Their electricity has increased from £160,000 to £712,000, totalling a devastating 345% rise. “They have been serving the community and employing local people for 60 years, but now face the real prospect of closing their doors for the last time. This business will be one of many businesses across the UK who face unprecedented uncertainty this winter. “The UK Government proposals are a sticking plaster on a fundamentally broken energy market. Any help is welcome, but prices are already beyond the reach of many businesses and third sector organisations. The six-month cliff edge gives only temporary reassurance – a permanent fix is urgently required. “What Scotland needs is the full powers of independence to create a wealthier, happier and fairer nation for every Scottish citizen. During the most distressing of times, we need the full range of financial levels to support our people and businesses.",

They say the Government was left “floundering” to explain which policies UK Councils will be expected to implement regarding waste and recycling after Britain leaves the EU.\nSNP Local Government spokesperson, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“All 400 Councils across these islands have been working hard over many years to reduce waste and ensure that we send as little as possible to landfill. This has been good for our environment, and has transformed the way we deal with our resources. Our current EU membership provides local councils with clear guidance when it comes to important waste and recycling policies, yet all of this could soon be thrown on the Great Repeal Bill bonfire.\n“Not for the first time, the rubbish response from the Secretary of State shows that this Government is absolutely floundering when it comes to the real detail of Brexit. Ministers obviously don’t have a clue what Councils will be asked to do, which has an impact on the decisions local authorities are making now about future investment in waste and recycling services.\n“At the moment, the UK generates over 200 million tonnes of waste every year and we need to be doing more – much more – to reduce that figure if we’re to leave a better environment for the generations to come after us. Local authorities need more detail so they can plan for the future, not the usual recycled Brexit soundbites from the UK Government.\nThe SNP’s spokesperson on Environment, Food & Rural Affairs, Calum Kerr MP said:\n“Across all departments and at all levels of government, Brexit is sowing confusion. We recently learned from DEFRA that their long awaited 25 year plan for the environment has been shelved until after the UK leaves the EU. Yet a long-term strategic vision on environmental issues is more vital than ever.\n“The EU has led the way in promoting the circular economy and setting ambitious waste reduction targets. This isn’t just red-tape: we know that prior to joining the ECC, Britain was known as the “dirty man of Europe”; there can be no return to that state of affairs.\n“The refusal of the UK government to offer clarity and reassurance on the question of waste and recycling is yet another indication that it is prepared to pursue a reckless Brexit at any cost, with no plan for what comes next.”",

The cross-party letter, set up by the APPG on Fuel Poverty and Energy Efficiency, has been signed by 40 MPs across a number of parties and has expressed “deep concern” for the UK’s poorest families. Campaign groups and charities have also called for urgent action, with Citizens Advice warning last week that 3.2 million people ran out of credit on their prepayment meter last year due to not being able to afford topping up. The letter comes ahead of Grant Schapps, Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Secretary, being questioned in the Commons on Tuesday about the meters. Commenting, Alison Thewliss MP said: “I echo the views of this letter and urge the Government to act immediately to support the most vulnerable constituents in my constituency. It is clear that this UK Tory Government are falling well short of the mark when it comes to the support being provided already. “This is another shameful policy being introduced by the UK Tory Government, and it sickens me that this decision has been agreed on in the first place. “Both this letter and my colleague Anne McLaughlin’s Ten-Minute Rule Bill on Pre-Payment Meters (Self-Disconnection) highlight the need for immediate action from this Tory Government. “People across my constituency should not be forced onto these prepayment meters, particularly during this difficult cost-of-living crisis. Companies should not be granted the opportunity to put their customers in an inhumane position to choose between heating their homes or feeding their children. “The Government must ban the forced installation of prepayment meters and move vulnerable people off these meters immediately.

  "http_www_alisonthewliss_scot/http_www_alisonthewliss_scot_make-tax-fair-in-malawi/content_451.html": "Alison Thewliss MP has backed a campaign calling for a fair tax deal for Malawi, a country with strong historic links with Glasgow Central.\nActionAid’s #MakeTaxFair campaign is pushing for reform of the 1955 UK-Malawi tax treaty, which makes it possible for UK companies operating in Malawi to dramatically reduce their tax bill. The call is part of a wider campaign to reform unfair tax treaties.\nScotland has had close links with Malawi, dating back to when Scottish explorer David Livingstone arrived in Malawi in the 1850s. Each year, more than 94,000 Scots are involved in organisations that link with Malawi, according to the Scotland Malawi Partnership, the national network which exists to coordinate, represent and support Scotland’s civic links with Malawi, and which is supporting ActionAid’s campaign.\nThe Scotland Malawi Partnership has a number of member organisations in Glasgow Central which have links with Malawi.\nMalawi is one of the poorest countries in the world, with GDP per person of just $255 per year. This is a country where 10.5 million people live in extreme poverty – surviving on less than US$1.90 a day. More tax revenue is desperately needed to improve public services and pay for more doctors and teachers. Malawi has one of the highest child mortality rates in the world with more than one in twenty children dying before the age of 5.\nUK companies are the third largest investor there, with investments worth a total of US$157 million in 2010. Yet the outdated and unfair tax treaty has tied the hands of the Malawian government. The treaty was signed in 1955, prior to Malawi’s independence, by the British Governor on behalf of the governments of the British colonies of Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland.\nThe treaty is so out-of-date that it does not cover the taxation of television related income. The treaty also makes it possible for British multinationals to easily move money out of Malawi untaxed using methods such as interest or management fee payments, dividends or royalties.\nMs Thewliss is supporting a joint campaign with Malawian and UK activists, calling on the Government to replace this treaty with one that is fairer, and that supports Malawi in its fight against poverty.\nSince the campaign launched, both the UK Government and the Government of Malawi issued statements in which they say they hope a treaty can be renegotiated soon. ActionAid and the Scotland Malawi Partnership welcome this progress, and will continue campaigning to ensure that any new treaty is fair and helps Malawi raise revenue to fight poverty.\nCommenting, Ms Thewliss said:\n“Corporate tax scandals show how angry the British public are that big business isn’t paying its fair share.\n“Scotland’s long and enduring relationship with Malawi stretches back over 150 years, and today many local people in [INSERT MP’s CONSTITUENCY] are actively engaged in building up social, cultural and economic ties. But the UK-Malawi tax treaty is not fit for the 21st century.\nThat’s why I’m calling on the UK government to agree a better deal with Malawi – one that ensures that UK companies pay their fair share in one of the world’s poorest countries.”\nCharlie Matthews, ActionAid UK’s Senior Advocacy Adviser, said:\n“Malawi is losing out due to an outdated and unfair treaty, which makes it possible for UK businesses operating there to dramatically reduce their tax bill. Women and girls living in poverty are the ones paying the price as public services like schools and hospitals are starved of funding.\n“ActionAid is working with the Scotland Malawi Partnership to call on the UK government to negotiate a new, fairer treaty, one that makes tax fair for the people of Malawi.”\nDavid Hope Jones of the Scotland-Malawi Partnership said:\n“Scotland is rightly proud of its many links with Malawi which date back more than 150 years to Dr David Livingstone. This dignified two-way people-to-people partnership unites our two nations in solidarity and friendship. Many of our 800+ member organisations across Scotland are concerned at the out-dated 1955 UK-Malawi Tax Treaty. We applaud both the UK and the Malawian Government for their commitment to update this colonial-era treaty, helping Malawi retain more tax revenue for the benefit of the people of Malawi. We look forward to seeing the outcome of the re-negotiation as soon as possible.”",

It is an inherently risky journey for people who are already vulnerable and desperate.\nHowever, there is no evidence to suggest that this Bill will have any impact on the number of dangerous crossings, or that a restrictive asylum policy in general acts as a deterrent. It is clear that the Home Office is aware of the limitations of these kinds of policies. In 2022, the Rwanda scheme lacked evidence to the point where the Civil Service was unable to confirm its value for public money.\nIt is extremely worrying to see the UK Government press ahead with policies which pose a serious and consistent threat to our international human rights obligations. It is worse still when these policies show no promise of delivering their intended consequences. This Bill will not make people safe – it will put victims of trafficking and modern slavery even more at risk, and leave refugees fleeing persecution in limbo, or offshored thousands of miles away.\nParliamentarians in both Scotland and the UK are human rights guarantors, and an important part of our role is to ensure that legislation is compliant with international obligations on human rights. The incompatibility of the Bill with the European Convention on Human Rights, the Refugee Convention, The Convention of Action Against Trafficking, and the Convention on the Rights of the Child means that we as lawmakers are obliged to vote against it.\nThe undermining of rights conveyed upon individuals by these agreements must be resisted by all spheres of government. This Bill will negatively impact directly on those seeking international protection in Scotland, as well as on the powers and duties of the Scottish Government, local authorities, and other public bodies under the devolution settlement. We call upon MSPs to withhold legislative consent when this legislation is put before the Scottish Parliament.\nArbitrary detention of refugee and asylum-seeking children and their families, trafficking victims, victims of torture and other vulnerable people is entirely unacceptable. You may recall that Scotland led the way in campaigning against child detention. In May 2010, Dungavel was closed to children, with detention centres elsewhere in the UK rapidly following suit. It is unthinkable that we now face a situation where these rights are being rolled back.\nScotland’s refugee and asylum-seeking community deserves better. The Home Office have shown time and time again that they cannot be trusted when it comes to looking after vulnerable children and adults.\nWe urge all Scottish parliamentarians to take a principled stand against this pernicious legislation.\nYours sincerely,\nAlan Brown MP\nAlison Thewliss MP\nAlasdair Allan MSP\nAllan Dorans MP\nAlyn Smith MP\nAmy Callaghan MP\nAngela Crawley MP\nAngus Brendan MacNeil MP\nAnne McLaughlin MP\nBill Kidd MSP\nBob Doris MSP\nBrendan O’Hara MP\nCarol Monaghan MP\nChris Law MP\nChris Stephens MP\nClare Adamson MSP\nColin Beattie MSP\nCollette Stevenson MSP\nDave Doogan MP\nDavid Linden MP\nDeidre Brock MP\nDouglas Chapman MP\nDr Lisa Cameron MP\nDr Philippa Whitford MP\nDrew Hendry MP\nEmma Roddick MSP\nEvelyn Tweed MSP\nFiona Hyslop MSP\nGavin Newlands MP\nGordon Macdonald MSP\nGraeme Dey MSP\nHannah Bardell MP\nJames Dornan MSP\nJenni Minto MSP\nJoanna Cherry KC MP\nJohn Mason MSP\nJohn McNally MP\nJohn Nicolson MP\nKaukab Stewart MSP\nKenny MacAskill MP\nKirsten Oswald MP\nKirsty Blackman MP\nMarie McNair MSP\nMarion Fellows MP\nMartin Docherty-Hughes MP\nMartyn Day MP\nMhairi Black MP\nMs Anum Qaisar MP\nOwen Thompson MP\nPatrick Grady MP\nPatricia Gibson MP\nPaul McLennan MSP\nPete Wishart MP\nPeter Grant MP\nRichard Thomson MP\nRona Mackay MSP\nRonnie Cowan MP\nRt Hon Ian Blackford MP\nRt Hon Stewart Hosie MP\nRuth Maguire MSP\nSiobhan Brown MSP\nStephanie Callaghan MSP\nStephen Flynn MP\nSteven Bonnar MP\nStewart Malcolm McDonald MP\nStuart McDonald MP\nStuart McMillan MSP\nTommy Sheppard MP",

Contrast this, for example, to the Scottish Government’s weighty white paper which was in place long before the Scottish independence referendum.\n“Leaving the EU was always, sadly, a possible outcome when the UK Government legislated for a referendum. The Prime Minister is only now, belatedly and hurriedly, setting up a new department in Whitehall to plan for Brexit. That’s just not good enough; a degree of certainty is crucial for all organisations to plan for the months and years ahead.\n“The Prime Minister must make it a top priority to get around the country, visit the businesses and organisations who’ll be affected by Brexit, and obtain answers about what this dreadful decision will mean for them”.\nA transcript of the exchange:\nAlison Thewliss MP: The Prime Minister said that we are entitled to all the benefits of EU membership up until the point at which we leave. Can I clarify if there has been any discussions about access to EU funding, such as Regional Selective Assistance which has created and safeguarded 10,000 jobs and been worth £83 million to Glasgow since 2010 and the terms and conditions of loans issued by the European Investment Bank, which also provided significant amounts of money and require some clarity for local authorities involved in the loans.\nPrime Minister: What I can say is that any contract entered into before Britain leaves the EU should be honoured in full in terms of EU funding for research or for regions of our country. The status we have with respect to the European Investment Bank will have to be determined as part of the negotiations and that is the sort of technical issue that the [dedicated] Whitehall unit can look at now and see what the options are so that we can discuss them in this House.",
  "http_www_alisonthewliss_scot/https_www_alisonthewliss_scot_bank-of-scotland-response-albert-drive-closure/content_10.html": "As my constituents may be aware, the Bank of Scotland branch on Albert Drive closed on the 27th July this year. After being contacted by a number of my constituents with concerns about this closure, I was able to raise these concerns directly with Bank of Scotland.\nPlease find Bank of Scotland’s response to my query about the Albert Drive branch closure below:\n“I understand that the closure of our Bank of Scotland branch in Pollokshields last month was disappointing for some members of the community.\n“We never take the decision to close any branch lightly. In this instance, the decision, was based on careful analysis of the usage of the branch over the last few years.\n“Before we made the announcement, we carefully considered the impact closing the branch would have on our customers. Our team visited the community to see for themselves the impact that closing the branch would have, looked at the alternative banking options available, and assessed the availability of public transport to get to the closest alternative branch.\n“We also looked at all information available to us – including the ways customers are choosing to bank with us, the number of vulnerable people in the local area, and the accessibility of alternative banking facilities including the Post Office. After carrying out this assessment, we only went ahead once we were satisfied there are suitable alternatives and sufficient access to cash locally.\n“As part of the industry-wide Cash Action Group process, LINK also independently reviewed overall cash provision in Pollokshields prior to our announcement being made. Given the alternatives available, they did not recommend any additional services.\n“Over the last five years, the number of transactions in our Pollokshields branch had continued to fall. The decline in transactions reflects wider trends across the industry, as people choose to use branches less often – accessing services over the telephone or online, or via the Post Office. The majority of our customers now choose to bank with us in more than one way. For example, 83 per cent of our personal customers at Pollokshields branch were already using other branches and other ways to bank such as Internet and Telephone Banking.\n“Our Bank of Scotland Glasgow Victoria Road branch is less than one mile away and there are regular direct trains to Victoria Road with a journey time of 5 minutes. Our Glasgow Shawlands branch is a little over one mile away and takes around 10 minutes to travel to on the bus. Currently both Glasgow Victoria Road branch and Glasgow Shawlands have extended opening hours in comparison to Pollokshields branch giving customers more convenience when they choose to visit the branch.\n“Through our commercial arrangement with the Post Office, all Bank of Scotland customers can withdraw and deposit cash for free over the counter, and pay in cheques, at any branch of the Post Office.\n“There are also other alternatives in the community including a number of free-to-use cash machines in the area, including three within 0.5 miles at Day Today, Kenmure Street, Friends Convenience Store, Pollokshaws Road, and Sainsbury’s, Darnley Road.\n“People can also use telephone banking or our online services. This means that for many of the day-to-day transactions required by our customers in Pollokshields, there is no need to travel to an alternative Bank of Scotland branch. Many customers find the ease of these alternatives to be preferable to travelling to and from a branch. For those looking to open a bank account, or apply for a loan or a mortgage, applications can be made online, or by phone. For those customers wanting to talk to a mortgage adviser face to face and from a place that suits them, our video call service could be the perfect option. More details can be found on our website.\n“You can be assured that branch staff talked to customers about the service the local Post Office offers and helped those who wished to learn about how to use online and telephone banking. Prior to the closure branch staff contacted vulnerable customers to help them understand the options available to them and supported them through the transition. We understand that some older customers may have concerns about banking online, although only 7 per cent of customers who used the Pollokshields branch are aged 75 plus. We also have a ‘Digital Helpline’ which offers free one-to-one guidance over the phone to support customers using the Internet for banking. Customers with an identified need for this service were provided with contact details, enabling them to get free support if required. We will also supply a free tablet and SIM card with data in cases where people cannot afford to go online.\n“Our online banking provides a variety of tools for managing a customer’s money.

Now in its 14th year, wear it pink raises over £2 million each year for world-class research into breast cancer, and this year it is back and bigger, brighter and bolder than ever before.\nAnyone can take part, whether in school, at work or at home. All you have to do is wear something pink and donate whatever you can.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“Right now breast cancer is at a tipping point. Every year in the UK around 50,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer, and sadly nearly 12,000 women still lose their lives to the disease. This is why we all must come together to support Breast Cancer Now’s cutting-edge research, and, in wear it pink, there is a fun and simple way for everyone to get involved.\n“I am particularly passionate about standing up for the women and families affected by the disease in Glasgow and I am very proud to take part in wear it pink. I hope everyone in the local community will join me in wearing it pink on Friday 23 October and show their support for Breast Cancer Now.”",

Since then, she has:\n- Questioned former Prime Minister David Cameron in the House of Commons;\n- Coordinated a cross party letter from MPs representing no less than nine parties in the Commons – including the Conservatives – calling for the then Prime Minister, David Cameron, to drop his planned policy;\n- Launched the website www.scraptherapeclause.co.uk, which led to over 10,000 signatures on a petition, forcing the Government to respond to public opposition to the policy;\n- Questioned former Chancellor George Osborne in the House of Commons;\n- Met with Welfare Reform Minister, Lord Freud, to press him on key details of the policy which still, to this day, remain unanswered;\n- Prompted a response from the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child, who expressed grave concern about the planned tax credit cuts;\n- Questioned former Secretary of State for Work & Pensions Iain Duncan Smith in the Commons;\n- Published damning calls from PCS, one of the main civil servants unions in the UK, calling for the policy to be abolished.\nThis week, the campaigning MP has written to Downing Street, calling upon Theresa May to use the recent change in Government and forthcoming Autumn Statement to abolish the deeply flawed changes to tax credits.\nIn addition, Ms Thewliss was informed today (Tuesday) that she has been granted a Westminster debate, which she says she will use to “interrogate” Ministers on their proposed plans.\nCommenting, the Glasgow Central MP said:\n“Theresa May certainly wasn’t shy in weeding out many of the former Prime Minister’s allies in the cabinet, and she is obviously not afraid to do things differently from David Cameron.\n“Given that she’s had the courage to do this and to review some of the previous Government’s key policy commitments, I am today calling upon her to scrap a very real and serious policy which is still frightening vulnerable women and welfare charities all over the UK.\n“Since summer 2015, I’ve been pursuing the Government on their deeply flawed plans to restrict tax credit payments to two children per family.\n“Equally worrying is their medieval plan to introduce a rape clause, whereby certain exemptions will be made – and tax credits paid – if a women can prove her third child was conceived as a result of rape.\n“Earlier this year, I had an dreadful meeting with the Welfare Minister, Lord Freud, who struggled to answer basic questions and suggested that women in abusive relationships – where the majority of rapes still happen – should just flee. This showed the Minister to be completely ignorant of the very real dangers some women face.\n“I am pleased to have secured a parliamentary debate on this issue to interrogate the Government on their cruel and unworkable policy. Over a year on from announcing it, they still don’t know how it could be implemented.\n“A parliamentary debate, change in personnel in Government, as well as the forthcoming Autumn Statement, means that Theresa May has plenty of opportunities to do the right thing, stand up for vulnerable women and scrap the rape clause.\n“This needn’t be about saving face for the Prime Minister. It’s about this Prime Minister standing up for other women, doing the decent thing and getting shot of this wicked policy agenda”.",

The Bill, presented by Geraint Davies MP, follows a report from the Royal Colleges that diesel fumes cause 40,000 premature deaths every year from lung cancer, strokes and heart disease. Diesel fumes also lead to underdevelopment in children and impact on foetuses, among other health effects.\nThe Air Quality Bill makes provisions for emissions testing to reflect on-road driving conditions, and assessment at the point of MOTs. The Bill also empowers local authorities to designate low emissions zones and pedestrianisation, and promotes cleaner public transport alternatives such as tram systems and LPG-powered vehicles.\nThe Environment Agency would be able to step in when a pollution cloud has hit an area, so that windows, doors and even roads can be closed, and if necessary local people evacuated until it is safe to return.\nAlison Thewliss MP said, “Diesel pollution causes 40,000 deaths a year, and costs £20bn according to the Royal College of Physicians. That is why I am supporting the Air Quality Bill, published today, which aims to save thousands of lives and billions of pounds. This is achieved through effective emissions testing, following the Volkswagen emissions scandal and promoting greener transport systems and vehicles.\n“Local residents in Glasgow are rightly concerned about their children coughing and wheezing, especially if children are already asthmatic. We now know that these health effects, and indeed thousands of deaths, are caused by toxic diesel fumes, which is why I am keen to support this important Bill.”\nGeraint Davies MP, who published the Bill, said “Our cities are pumping out diesel clouds which threaten the lives of families, in particular young children and unborn babies. The Bill will ensure reliable vehicle emissions testing, new powers for councils to clean up local air, and a focus in the Budget on sustainable transport. This will help save thousands of lives and billions of pounds lost to diesel pollution.”\nDr Penny Woods, Chief Executive of the British Lung Foundation, said: “Air pollution causes tens of thousands of early deaths every year, increases the risk of lung cancer and impairs child lung development. Geraint Davies’ Bill further highlights these unacceptable dangers to the nation’s lung health. Immediate action must be taken by the government.”",
  "http_www_alisonthewliss_scot/https_www_alisonthewliss_scot_government-still-failing-miserably-to-enforce-minimum-wage/content_686.html": "SNP MP, Alison Thewliss, has hit out at new data which suggests that the Government is failing miserably to get a grip on tackling low and exploitative pay.\nCommenting following the publication of answers to a series of written parliamentary questions she tabled, the Glasgow MP said Prime Minister Theresa May’s apparent desire to tackle the “burning injustices” in society, as well as efforts to support the “just about managing”, was nothing more than empty rhetoric.\nSeizing on data released to her by Treasury and Cabinet Office Ministers, Ms Thewliss said this wasn’t the first time she had raised the issue, having requested similar data from Government officials last year. Following that, she wrote a scathing letter to the former Prime Minister David Cameron, urging him to make tackling low pay a priority.\nCommenting, Glasgow Central SNP MP Alison Thewliss said:\n“Last summer might have seen a change of occupant in 10 Downing Street but it appears to be business as usual for this Tory Government; they appear to have no interest whatsoever in tackling pay inequality and exploitation. Theresa May’s impassioned speech on the steps of Downing Street has been exposed again and again as empty rhetoric.\n“Disappointingly, when I obtained last year’s data from the Government, over 100,000 Scots were still being paid below the national minimum wage. This is in stark contrast to the Scottish Government, and huge swathes of Scotland’s public services, who pay the real living wage of £8.45 per hour.\n“House of Commons Library figures reveal that for 2015-16 alone 950 employers have been found by HMRC not to be paying the minimum wage. Over the past decade only 13 prosecutions have taken place for non-compliance, which simply beggars belief.\n“These shocking figures also show that the Government is doing very little to crack down on employers who aren’t complying with National Minimum Wage legislation passed almost two decades ago. Indeed, the Minister’s response reveals the Government don’t think it’s worth prosecuting companies for non-compliance. This sends an incredibly worrying signal to exploitative employers who will think it is perfectly acceptable to pay peanuts for a fair day’s work.\n“If Theresa May is truly serious about supporting the “just about managing” in society, she needs to implement an urgent action plan.\n“The Prime Minister should start by cracking down heavily on exploitative employers who are flouting minimum wage laws. Companies won’t take this matter seriously if all they can expect is a rap on the knuckles.\n“Theresa May should implement a real living wage, as set by the Living Wage Foundation, rather than the pale imitation being punted by her Chancellor. The real Living Wage is being successfully promoted by the Scottish Government, with Scottish Canals being announced just this week as the 700th employer in Scotland to sign up.\n“Thirdly, and as part of an action plan, we need to have genuine pay equality – not just for women but for young people as well. Currently, the UK Government has a ridiculous system whereby minimum wage rates are set in accordance with age. That means if you’re a sixteen year old apprentice, the law says you can be paid as little as £3.40 per hour. How does that fit into the Prime Minister’s new obsession about a shared society?\n“I’ve written to the Prime Minister setting out three very simple and practical steps she could take to tackle this – I hope sincerely I won’t be sending the same action plan next year when I request these figures from the Government again”.",

This approach recognises that addiction is primarily a health issue and should be treated as such, rather than as a criminal matter.\n“Decades of evidence and international experiences have shown that punitive approaches to drug use have not been successful in reducing drug-related harms. Instead, they have perpetuated a cycle of criminalisation, stigmatisation, and marginalisation, leading to devastating consequences for individuals and communities.\n“By decriminalising drug use, we can shift the focus towards harm reduction, rehabilitation, and support services. This approach will enable individuals struggling with drug addiction to seek the help they need without fear of criminal repercussions. It opens up the possibility of treating addiction as a public health issue, offering individuals a chance to recover and reintegrate into society.\n“I commend the Scottish Government for their progressive stance and for prioritising the health and well-being of individuals affected by drug addiction. For too long, my constituents have been suffering at the hands of these restrictive policies for drug users. It is high time that this UK Tory Government take action to support people all across these Isles through a renewed approach to drug use.”",

While anyone on the register could be a match for someone with blood cancer, men aged 16-30 are most likely to be asked to donate, and are currently underrepresented on the register. There is also a shortage of donors from non-white and mixed-race backgrounds.\nAlison Thewliss MP said:\n“I am very proud that Glasgow Central has 1,760 people who have selflessly volunteered to give someone a second chance at life. Donating stem cells is straightforward but it could make an enormous difference to someone with no other chance of a cure.\n“I strongly hope that more people across Glasgow will be inspired to sign up and show that together, our communities can provide a cure for blood cancer.”\nHenny Braund, Chief Executive of Anthony Nolan, said: “It’s wonderful to have this opportunity to celebrate the achievements the transplant community has made in the past year, and we’re particularly grateful to all the registered donors in Glasgow Central for helping us in our goal of saving and improving the lives of people with blood cancer and blood disorders.\n“Anthony Nolan’s pioneering research, dedicated nurses and patient-focused services mean we have increased the support patients receive at every stage of their transplant journey – but without the contribution of selfless donors, our vital work would be impossible.”",

Throughout this entire time, it’s been abundantly clear that this policy is immoral and unworkable.\n“Even by the UK Government’s standards, this is a total mess. These plans are due to come into force in just 27 days and hundreds of thousands of third party professionals haven’t had the training in the policy which was promised. This puts these frontline workers in an incredibly difficult position should a woman come forward to present a claim.\n“Any woman making a claim under the rape clause will already have been through unimaginable trauma, and will expect officials to understand the policy and be able to support her. Without training and guidelines, this is impossible; it will only serve to make that woman feel more stigmatised and vulnerable.\n“Other departments in Whitehall are openly distancing themselves from the policy and the UK Government hasn’t even laid the necessary regulations before Parliament which would enable this to happen. This is ridiculous when you consider that it’s due to be implemented in just under a month.\n“I suspect UK Government Ministers know this is an unworkable, cruel, policy which will cause untold pain and stress for rape survivors.

Figures released by Public Health England reveal that Blackpool has below average breastfeeding rates, with 61.6% of mothers initiating breastfeeding within 48 hours of their babies being born, compared with 74.3% for England as a whole.\nCommenting prior to her visit, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“The closure of peer support services for breastfeeding in Blackpool has left many people understandably concerned about the quality and level of support available for new mums who are taking their first steps into parenthood.\n“Mums need access to reliable sources of information in order to make the best decisions for feeding their babies and understanding what works for them for feeding their babies. Drawing on the knowledge of mums who have breastfed their babies within the first few weeks of a baby’s life provides valuable guidance and support at what can be a daunting and stressful period for new mums.\n“The APPG has heard evidence of the positive impact that peer support services like Star Buddies can have on the lives of new mums. I am keen to recognise the efforts of those volunteers who have dedicated their time to run the service in Blackpool and challenge the decision of the Council to close an effective, integrated service which made an important contribution to improving breastfeeding rates.”",

The MPs were putting their case for lifting the ban on asylum seekers to work.\nDespite a number of attempts from MPs to intervene on the Minister, Sarah Newton, they were told that there was not enough time to take interventions or questions. The Minister then closed the debate early without addressing many of the points raised by MPs.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“Today I outlined the societal and economic benefits of lifting the ban on asylum seekers working. Valid points were raised by Conservative, Labour and SNP MPs, all of which were ducked by the Minister.\n“I am not sure whether the Minister responding didn’t know her brief or if she was genuinely trying to shut down legitimate questions about the fallacy of the current policy.\n“Frustratingly, the Government merely repeated the usual right wing rhetoric we’re so used to hearing when it comes to asylum and immigration policy.\n“Despite a contemptable performance from the Minister today, the SNP won’t be letting go of this issue. The case for lifting the ban on asylum seekers working is both morally and economically justified.

Throughout this entire time, it’s been abundantly clear that this policy is immoral and unworkable.\n“Even by the UK Government’s standards, this is a total mess. These plans are due to come into force in just 27 days and hundreds of thousands of third party professionals haven’t had the training in the policy which was promised. This puts these frontline workers in an incredibly difficult position should a woman come forward to present a claim.\n“Any woman making a claim under the rape clause will already have been through unimaginable trauma, and will expect officials to understand the policy and be able to support her. Without training and guidelines, this is impossible; it will only serve to make that woman feel more stigmatised and vulnerable.\n“Other departments in Whitehall are openly distancing themselves from the policy and the UK Government hasn’t even laid the necessary regulations before Parliament which would enable this to happen. This is ridiculous when you consider that it’s due to be implemented in just under a month.\n“I suspect UK Government Ministers know this is an unworkable, cruel, policy which will cause untold pain and stress for rape survivors. They have had quite long enough to figure this out, and if Ministers don’t voluntarily drop this policy, I’ll be submitting requests to drag Ministers before the despatch box in Parliament every day until they do.”\n1 thought on “Under a month until rape clause – Government has no plan in place”",
  "http_www_alisonthewliss_scot/https_www_alisonthewliss_scot_category_campaigns_page_17/content_209.html": "(The below post was published in The Telegraph on 19th January 2016)\nNo woman should have to prove she was raped to be able to claim child tax credits. It’s a dramatic statement, and it’s one that has raised many questions – so perhaps it’s best to go back to the start.\nHidden away on page 88 of Chancellor George Osborne’s Budget in July was a small, almost innocuous sentence, which related to the Government’s plan to restrict the child element of tax credits and Universal Credit – child benefit, essentially – to the first two children:\n“The Department of Work and Pensions and HMRC will develop protections for women who have a third child as a result of rape, or other exceptional circumstances”.\nI read the sentence again. I re-read it. I showed it to the colleague sitting next to me. What did this actually mean? How would DWP and HMRC prove that a child was borne of rape?\nThe more I thought about this, the more furious I became. Rape is a very serious crime, but yet one of the most under-reported and under-convicted crimes there is. It exists in abusive relationships, it exists in marriage. For many women, is traumatic beyond description, and it is something they feel is shameful.\nHow vile that this Government would consider putting a woman, who may already feel extremely vulnerable, in the position where she had to confess to an Government official that her child had been born as a result of rape. How stigmatising, for that woman, for that child and for the family. Piling humiliation on top of pain is not the essence of “protection”.\nI’ve raised this with Ministers at every level of Government, including the Prime Minister himself.\nFor all the questions my colleagues and I have asked since the July budget, there has yet to be an answer as to how this will work, and particularly the burden of proof.\nThe DWP and HMRC are not known for being organisations that will take you at your word; the casework I have seen in my office gives me no confidence in either the competence or the sensitivity of these departments. What hope does a woman in such vulnerable circumstances have? Will they accept her word, or will only a criminal conviction do? We don’t yet know.\nHowever, the real problem at the heart of this is not even the rape clause; it’s the two child policy.\nFor me, it’s tantamount to social engineering. It makes children a financial commodity. It passes judgement and stigmatises.\nIt doesn’t respect the disproportionate impact on those of particular faiths or backgrounds where larger families are the norm. It’s also economic madness, as we need more children to counter our ageing population. And it runs counter to our Government’s obligations to treat children equally under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.\nThe two child policy has not yet been fully explained or justified by this Government, other than in the most tabloid of terms. I’ve heard some suggest in carelessly callous language that you should only have the children you can afford. It does not take account of the fact that you may well be able to “afford” three children when you had them, but not if your circumstances change: what if your partner dies, if you become disabled, if your marriage breaks up?\nWhat happens in the case where families come together with existing children from previous relationships?\nThe Budget claimed multiple births would be protected, but not at which stage; if your first two children are twins, will the third still be eligible, or only if that happens the other way around?\nThese questions and more have been asked by MPs since July, but answers have not been forthcoming.\nThe campaign to scrap the rape clause is gathering pace and many people are already signing the petition, which had almost 6,000 names at the last count. This should, in itself, send a message to the Government that this policy is untenable.\nI very much hope that the Government has realised the mess it has got itself into, and scrap not only this outdated and potentially damaging rape clause – but the whole two child policy itself.",

In 2015 for example, there was 47 new diagnoses of HIV compared to an annual average of 10, for those who are injecting drugs. Indeed, there is thought to be around 500 people who regularly inject drugs in public places in Glasgow City Centre alone.\n“I can attest to the fact that Glasgow has a growing problem with respect to public injecting; my constituency office often receives reports of needles and other drug paraphernalia being discarded in public places. In addition, I have seen for myself public injecting taking place in locations not far from where my office is located.\n“It’s clear to me that the drug injecting population in Glasgow face a number of different barriers in accessing health services which can help them with their addiction, and that current methods are falling short of offering the appropriate level of support. For this reason, Glasgow City Health and Social Care Partnership, and other parties, have developed innovative plans for the implementation of a Safe Injecting Facility.\n“It is imperative that the Home Office consider this request – which has cross-party support from a number of Scottish MPs – to allow an SDCF to be trialled in Glasgow. This issue has become a serious public health issue, and it is our collective responsibility to ensure that we do what we can to improve the situation not just for drug users, but for the wider public in general”.",

It is important that milk donors are following best practice to ensure breastmilk is free from any contaminants, but this will always have a degree of uncertainty when people are sharing milk online.\n“Milk banks provide safe and rigorously screened donor breastmilk for those babies who need it. The model used by One Milk Bank for Scotland ensures that breastmilk can be collected from donors, processed and distributed using a well-developed network, and I would like to see this available across the rest of the UK. At the moment, milk banks are often underfunded and running as a project of individual hospitals.\n“This also sits in the context of cuts to breastfeeding support projects – Unicef Baby Friendly highlighted recently that local infant feeding leads in England had reported a 47% cut in support groups, and a 58% cut in health visitors. Women who wish to breastfeed can find themselves without the valuable support and expertise they need, and may turn to online donors as an alternative to their own milk.\n“I am keen for the UK Government to work with the UK Association of Milk Banks to invest in services to allow those wishing to donate breastmilk to be able to do so locally, in a safe and regulated way, and for those requiring breastmilk for their babies to be able to access it easily.

The BHF estimates that 10,000 people die every year as rates of bystander CPR are very low.\nEvery minute without CPR or defibrillation can reduce a person’s chance of surviving a cardiac arrest by around ten per cent.\nAlison Thewliss, MP for Glasgow Central, said:\n“It is worrying to hear the number of lives being lost because rates of bystander CPR in the UK are too low. Every second counts, and CPR really is the difference between life and death.”\n“All young people should have the skills to save a life.

The chance of surviving is almost zero if people collapse and receive no bystander CPR until the emergency services arrive.\n“There is clearly a huge benefit to the public knowing life saving CPR skills, evidenced by the vastly better survival rates from cardiac arrests in countries where CPR is part of the curriculum.

Through the campaign, Diabetes UK is making the following calls to government:\n- Mandatory front-of-pack traffic light labelling on all pre-packed foods and drinks sold in the UK,\n- Mandatory calorie labelling on menus in key high street restaurants, cafes and takeaways, with carb content available online or when you ask for it in store,\n- Ensure carbohydrates are labelled on the back of products, per portion and as prepared.\nClear food labelling is vital for millions of people living with diabetes, to help them manage their condition and reduce their risk of serious complications. In a 2017 survey of more than 9,000 people living with or affected by diabetes, almost three quarters of respondents (73%) said that if all companies used the same food labelling system it would help them to make healthier choices.\nClear food labelling also helps the wider public, with or without diabetes, make more informed decisions about what they eat and drink. Recent public polling carried out by ComRes on behalf of\nDiabetes UK revealed that 9 out of 10 people said traffic-light food labelling helps them make healthier decisions, while only three in ten people (29%) said they felt they had enough information about what’s in their food.\nIn addition, more than three quarters of people (76%) said that cafes, restaurants and takeaways should display calorie information on their menus, so that customers understand the content of the food and drink they buy.\nTraffic-light labelling assigns a red, amber or green value in relation to fat, saturated fat, sugar and salt, as well as giving information on the calories in a product, to help consumers find out what’s in the food and drink they’re buying. Evidence shows that both front-of-pack traffic light labelling and calorie labelling informs consumers and helps making the healthier choice the easier choice.\nHowever, clear and consistent food labelling is not currently compulsory. Companies don’t have to provide any information on the front of their goods, and one in three products in shops don’t have clear traffic-light labels. Many restaurants, cafes and takeaways also still do not provide calorie labelling on their menus or other nutritional information online or when asked for it in store.\nCommenting on the campaign, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“The public have made it clear that they support clearer labelling on food and drink to help them make healthier and better informed decisions about what they eat, so I’m happy to lend my support to Diabetes UK’s Food Upfront campaign.\n“Putting these simple measures into place could make a huge difference to the nation as a whole. Obesity and weight related chronic health conditions – including Type 2 diabetes – continue to rise, and it’s important that we do everything that we can to halt this growing health crisis.”\nHelen Dickens, Assistant Director of Campaigns and Mobilisation at Diabetes UK, said:\n“We know that consistent and clear food labelling can help all of us to make informed choices. For people with diabetes, easy access to clear and consistent labelling, for example on carbohydrate content, is vital to supporting them with their diabetes management.\n“With around two-thirds of adults, and almost a third of children in the UK classed as overweight or obese, and therefore at increased risk of Type 2 diabetes and other chronic health conditions, it’s really important that we have measures in place that help make it easier for all of us to know what’s in the food we’re buying.\n“That’s why we are calling for the government to strengthen and, when possible, introduce mandatory front of pack traffic-light labelling on packaging, and calorie labelling on menus. The British public overwhelmingly support these moves, so we are grateful to Alison Thewliss MP for her efforts in helping put these potentially life-changing measures into practice.”",

The Central Parliament Poppy Appeal is the only charity that can fundraise in Parliament.\nCommenting on the event, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“I would like to thank the Industry and Parliament Trust and The Royal British Legion for arranging this event. The Royal British Legion provides invaluable support to The Armed Forces community; I am pleased to have been able to support such a worthy cause.”\nNick Maher, CEO of the IPT, said:\n“The work of The Royal British Legion is essential to the lives of the whole Armed Forces community across the UK and I am delighted that MPs and Peers are supporting us in our efforts to raise money for such a worthwhile cause. The support and enthusiasm from parliamentarians and service men and women has been fantastic”.",

This problem has persisted throughout the cost of energy crisis and UK Government support has not successfully addressed this matter, repeatedly failing the residents of Riverside Dalmarnock.\n“To that effect, I would be interested in hearing from you as to what steps the UK Government is taking to tackle this problem, in light of its commitment to shield all households from spiralling energy costs, and what particular support it may offer to my constituents on communal heat networks. I would be happy to meet with you to discuss this subject in greater detail if that were of any interest.”\nIn their response, the Department for Net Zero and Energy Security said:\n“The Energy Act 2023 has now passed into law and will provide us with powers to regulate the heat networks sector and appoint Ofgem as regulator. The Act gives ministers powers to introduce consumer protection rules and carbon emissions limits on heat networks.\n“The legislation will give Ofgem powers to investigate and intervene on networks where prices for consumers appear to be unfair, or if prices are significantly higher than comparable heating systems. Our ambition is that consumer protections will start to be regulated from Spring 2025 with price regulation beginning Spring 2026.”\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“It is completely unacceptable that my constituents need to wait until Spring of 2026 before any action is taken to halt the soaring cost of energy bills. A number of constituents in Dalmarnock served by an unregulated communal heat network have been in touch, experiencing severe financial worry, yet it seems that the UK Government and the powerless energy regulator Ofgem are just standing back and letting it happen.\n“I asked the Prime Minister today whether it was the Government’s incompetency or Ofgem’s lack of powers that have caused these rising bills. His inability to provide an answer highlights the blatant disregard the UK Government has shown to these vulnerable constituents.\n“In energy-rich Scotland, nobody should be forced to choose between heating their own home or putting food on the table. We must have full control over energy to ensure our people are not left in the cold this winter.”",

There has been great partnership working between the Scottish Government, Glasgow City Council, GHA and Wheatley Group and the private sector in Crudens. These 100 affordable, high-quality new homes have made a real difference in the community already, giving local people access to affordable, warm, modern homes.\n“The contrast between Scotland and England on provision of affordable housing for social rent and for sale couldn’t be greater.

The repeated claim by Ministers that controversial sites like the Bibby Stockholm barge, Wethersfield and Scampton would save money have been exposed as fallacy by this National Audit Office report.\n“Officials have acted in haste to meet political targets, and public funds have been filling the coffers of private companies, with very little by way of oversight.\n“The Home Office must focus instead on processing asylum cases and allowing those who have come to our shores for sanctuary to get on with rebuilding their lives, rather than leaving them languishing indefinitely in unsuitable and expensive accommodation.”",

Despite making his budget statement to Parliament on International Women’s Day, Phillip Hammond MP did not use the budget as an opportunity to scrap the Government’s controversial rape clause and two child policy. The Glasgow MP said today’s “missed opportunity” was an insult to women all across the UK who were celebrating International Women’s Day.\nIn the George Osborne’s budget of July 2015 – and buried within the small print – the UK Government announced plans to restrict tax credit payments to two children per family and force women to provide evidence of exceptional circumstances, such as rape, to claim tax credits for a third child from April 2017.\nCommenting from Westminster after the Chancellor delivered his budget speech to Parliament, Ms Thewliss said:\n“Today’s budget was a real missed opportunity for Phillip Hammond and Theresa May to do the honourable thing and scrap the UK Government’s pernicious two child policy and medieval rape clause.\n“I cannot begin to describe the sheer desolation I felt when I looked at the UK Government’s Red Book today of all days – International Women’s Day – and saw that this callous Chancellor is still intending to make women prove they’ve been raped in order to receive tax credits.\n“I’ve spent over a year and a half campaigning against this appalling policy, and I still cannot believe that any Government would think it’s acceptable to put women and their families through such incredible pain and misery.\n“Although they’ve not yet laid the necessary statutory instrument before Parliament, it’s looking increasingly likely that the UK Government is planning to implement the rape clause on the April 6th.

This is an important commitment, but it only goes a small way to help those in need. There is a need for the international community to do more to commit to support those desperately in need, and also for routes to be established to allow that aid to get in to Gaza.

A majority of those affected travelled to the UK under the now obsolete Tier 1 (General) route; many are skilled professionals and others business owners.\nIn May, the Home Secretary, Sajid Javid, wrote to the Home Affairs Select Committee detailing that all applications falling for refusal under the character and conduct guidance of the Immigration Rules would be put on hold pending the findings of an internal review. Evidence from the Highly Skilled Migrants campaign group suggests however that decisions are still being made.\nCommenting following the debate, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“The response from the Minister today fell way short of what was required, and will give little hope to the many hundreds of people across the UK who are left with the unenviable task of trying to clear their names and rebuild their lives in light of this Home Office malevolence. I am utterly appalled by the Minister’s lack of compassion and knowledge of this issue.\n“It’s blatantly clear to me, and to scores of other MPs, lawyers and campaigners that the Home Office has made a calculated decision to pursue people in this way, using 322(5) rules in an attempt to legitimise their actions. Policies like this have no place in modern society. Indeed, this scandal is akin to Windrush part two.\n“What is particularly striking about the actions of the Home Office is that they seem to be out of step with other government departments. HMRC, for example, have said in a number of cases that individuals who have corrected their tax information have done the right thing. Similarly, a Treasury Minister confirmed recently that they would encourage people to continue to correct their returns as and when they notice an error.\n“It is incumbent on the UK Government to get their house in order here. The immigration system is clearly broken, and it’s innocent people like those we heard about in the debate who are bearing the brunt. I urge the Home Office to act now, and retract this vile policy”.\nThe letter from the Home Secretary to the Chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee can be accessed here – https://tinyurl.com/y9kxtgpg\nThewliss challenges Treasury on highly skilled migrants\nMP for Glasgow Central, Alison Thewliss, today quizzed Ministers during Treasury Questions on the government’s use of paragraph 322(5) of the immigration rules, and their treatment of skilled migrants.\nThe Home Office has come under fire recently for pursuing the removal of a number of migrants – some of whom have been resident in the UK for more than 10 years – after they made minor corrections to their tax returns. As a result, many have been sent correspondence stating that the Home Office believe them to be of questionable character and that they represent a threat to national security.\nDuring the exchange, Thewliss urged Ministers to take this matter up with their colleagues in the Home Office.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“The Treasury have confirmed to me today that it is entirely reasonable and sensible for people to make legitimate corrections and amendments to their tax returns. Yet, in the case of skilled migrants, these are the very actions being interpreted by the Home Office as somehow unacceptable.\n“From the Minister’s response today, it’s manifestly clear that there is a lack of joined up thinking across government. Many of the individuals affected by this merciless policy are working in highly skilled occupations, and have put down roots in this country and contributed greatly both to their communities and to the economy.\n“The UK Government should be doing its utmost to make the UK an attractive place for these people to stay, instead it is actively presiding over a hostile environment policy which is ruining people’s lives.\n“I urge the Treasury to bring what pressure it can to bear on the Home Office, to make clear that legitimately correcting a tax return should not later lead to a threat of removal from the UK”.\nAlison Thewliss MP celebrates Nurses’ Day 2018\nAlison Thewliss, MP for Glasgow Central, celebrated the work of nursing staff in the UK and around the world by meeting frontline nurses as part of the RCN’s International Nurses’ Day celebrations on Wednesday 25 April.\nThe event in Parliament brought together MPs and nurses and give Ms Thewliss the opportunity to hear about the valuable contributions nursing staff make to patient care. Nursing is a highly-skilled profession and nursing staff care for patients in a variety of settings such as, at music festivals, in prisons and in accident and emergency departments.\nNurses’ Day is an international event held annually on Florence Nightingale’s birthday (12 May). This year, the RCN is showcasing nurses’ dedication to delivering outstanding patient care and the innovative and diverse roles nurses have in healthcare teams. The RCN is also encouraging nursing staff to use the hashtag #ThisNurse to share stories of colleagues who went the extra mile to provide patient care and times which reminded them why there are nursing in 2018.\nAlison Thewliss MP said:\n“Nurses’ Day is a fantastic way to show our support for nursing staff in our health and care services. It’s our chance to thank them for the care they provide to our families, friends, neighbours and colleagues. I encourage everyone to celebrate the remarkable work of nursing staff in Glasgow and across Scotland.”\nJanet Davies, Chief Executive and General Secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, said\n“Nursing is a dynamic profession with caring for people at its heart. Nurses’ Day is a wonderful opportunity to celebrate the incredible work nursing staff do every single day of the year.\n“There is no ‘one size fits all’ rule for nursing staff. They work in a variety of settings and have a diverse range of skills. But what unties them all is their dedication, even in difficult circumstances, to delivering outstanding patient care.”\nSNP MP launches Private Members’ Bill on safe drug consumption facilities\nMP for Glasgow Central, Alison Thewliss, has today launched her Private Members’ Bill on Safe Drug Consumption Facilities (SDCFs), in an attempt to tackle head-on the growing number of people dying in Glasgow as a result of drug overdose.\nThe Supervised Drug Consumption Facilities Bill seeks to amend key areas of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, and if passed would enable plans for a pilot facility to proceed in Glasgow, ensuring that service users and employees can use the facility without fear of being prosecuted.\nIn recent months, proposals for a SDCF have gathered cross party support from MPs at Westminster and a majority of MSPs in the Scottish Parliament, as well as the unanimous backing of councillors at Glasgow City Council.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“The weight of evidence in support of a safe drugs consumption facility has never been more compelling. There are approximately 500 people actively injecting drugs in Glasgow city centre, and recent reports describe the unprecedented HIV outbreak in the city as out of control. What’s more, I am greatly concerned for the safety of my constituents as a result of needles left in bin sheds, closes and back lanes.\n“Recent debates in the Scottish Parliament and Glasgow City Council have demonstrated a clear desire for the introduction of a safe drug consumption facility, with support from all parties, including members of the Conservative Party. My Bill will take new steps to enable drug addiction to be treated as a public health issue, whilst ensuring that criminal activity from illegal drugs continues to be robustly tackled by the police.\n“People are dying on the streets of my constituency, and the risk to the general public from discarded needles and transmission of blood-borne diseases is very real. The only remaining barrier to doing something different is the Home Office’s unwillingness to grant an exemption.\n“Perhaps if the Home Secretary visited my constituency, and witnessed the perilousness of the situation for her herself, she could be more easily persuaded. Others, it seems, are already convinced.”\nSNP MP calls link between welfare reform and increase foodbank use “undeniable”\nMP for Glasgow Central, Alison Thewliss, has today called the link between government welfare reform policies and increased foodbank use “undeniable”, following the recent publication of the Trussell Trust’s annual foodbank statistics.\nAccording to the trust, the biggest single, and fastest growing, reason for people attending foodbanks is “Low income – benefits, not earning”. Responses in this category have increased significantly since April 2016.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“Examining these figures from the Trussell Trust, it is now undeniable that there is a link between government welfare reform policies and increased foodbank use.\n“It is utterly appalling that in today’s society, people must rely on food parcels due to not having enough to live on. The report speaks to the fact that the basic costs of food, housing and utility bills continue to rise, and benefits are failing to keep pace.\n“The number of foodbank referrals as a result of a reduction in benefit, or due to delays when moving to a new benefit such as Universal Credit, have seen a dramatic upturn. Similarly, the Trussell Trust commented that foodbank projects in Universal Credit rollout areas have experienced an average increase of 52% in the preceding 12 months, with many citing issues when transitioning to the new benefit.\n“We already know about the squeeze being put on families as a result of the benefit cap, and the damaging consequences of the two-child limit and rape clause, now there is real and demonstrable evidence elucidating a clear link between changes to welfare and increased use of foodbanks.\n“It is incumbent on Ministers not to ignore the burden of evidence that has been presented on increasedfoodbank use. To do so would serve only to reassert that this is a government that cares little about the unmistakeable plight of so many across the country”.\nAlison Thewliss MP worked up a sweat meeting athletes with a learning disability\nOn April 18th, Alison Thewliss MP perfected the art of losing graciously as she was challenged to sporting contests by athletes with a learning disability at the All Party Parliamentary Group on Learning Disability’s event exploring pathways into elite sport.\nThe event brought together a wide range of athletes and parents, Members of Parliament and National Governing Bodies to highlight the lack of opportunities for athletes with a learning disability to compete at the elite level.\nRt Hon Mark Harper MP chaired the event and held a Q&A session with Paralympic gold-medal-winning swimmer, Jessica-Jane Applegate MBE who spoke about her experiences in elite sport. Talented runner, Kieran O’Hara, also spoke about his journey and struggles to make it to the elite level due to the lack of pathways.\nMembers of the Great Britain Para Taekwondo team provided a demonstration, and the Brighton table tennis club kept Alison Thewliss MP on her toes as they showed her how to execute the perfect rally.\nRuth Owens, Development Manager at Mencap, said:\n“It is unacceptable, that despite dedicating their lives to training, athletes with a learning disability have such little opportunity to be recognised for their talents and are unable to achieve their dream of competing in the Paralympics alongside their disabled peers.\n“It is wholly unfair that since the ban in 2000 a shadow has been cast over athletes with a learning disability. Not only do we need to see more opportunities available at the Paralympics, but this inequality needs to be addressed in the UK as well.\n“We’re hugely grateful for all the MPs and sports governing bodies that attended our event today. We hope this can raise further awareness to open up more opportunities for athletes with a learning disability to have the chance to compete and be recognised for their talents at the highest level.”\nCommenting after the event, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“I was proud to attend the APPG on Learning Disability’s event today and engage with the many talented athletes present. It was concerning to hear about the obstacles these athletes face when seeking to compete at the elite level and the event provided a good opportunity to highlight this to National Governing Bodies as well as fellow Members.\n“The event must be seen as a catalyst for action and I look forward to continuing to engage on this subject and help talented athletes with a learning disability reach their potential.”\nPM’S response on rape clause “reprehensible” says SNP MP\nSNP MP for Glasgow Central, Alison Thewliss, has criticised the Prime Minister’s response on the rape clause during Wednesday’s offering of PMQs.\nIan Blackford, SNP Leader at Westminster, had asked Theresa May whether she agreed with her colleague Esther McVey, Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, that the rape clause offered women “double support”. The Prime Minister advanced that the UK Government has taken care to ensure the issue is dealt with sensitively, with Blackford countering that the clause is a disgrace.\nThe rape clause, or non-consensual sex exemption, has been in place for over a year, and forms part of the government’s wider policy to restrict Tax Credits and Universal Credit (child element) claims to the first two children in a family.\nEarlier this week, McVey defended the government’s record on welfare reform during an evidence hearing of the Social Security Committee at Holyrood.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“It really is repugnant to see the Prime Minister leaping to the Secretary of State’s defence on the issue of the rape clause.\n“Earlier this week Esther McVey described this vile policy as “extra help”, “an opportunity to talk” and “double support”. It is none of these things. By supporting it, the Prime Minister and her government are complicit in putting vulnerable women in harm’s way.\n“Experts in violence against women recognise that forced disclosure of abuse brings a significant risk of reliving that trauma. This should always be at a time of a woman’s choosing, not at the point where she has to make a choice about putting food on the table to feed her children.\n“Any defence of the two child limit and rape clause is truly reprehensible. The entire policy is ill-judged, cruel, and has nothing to do with supporting women. It must be scrapped.\n“I hope the Secretary of State will reflect on her words, and respond to my request for an urgent meeting without delay”.\nThewliss condemns McVey’s comments on rape clause\nAlison Thewliss, MP for Glasgow Central, has responded to comments made by the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Esther McVey, during a Scottish Parliament Social Security Committee on the issue of Conservative welfare reform policies.\nAt Monday’s session McVey was questioned on the Government’s Universal Credit policy, which many committee members decried for pushing thousands of families into poverty, with an inequitable burden being placed on low-earners.\nAlison Johnstone, Green MSP for the Lothian region, pressed McVey on the Government’s position on the two child limit and the non-consensual sex exemption, commonly known as the rape clause. Far from showing contrition, the Secretary of State instead posited that the policy offers “double support”.\nA demonstration against the two child policy – one year since its implementation – will be held on Thursday 19 April at 5.30pm, on The Mound, Edinburgh.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“I didn’t think the Tory government could sink any lower on this issue, but they have once again outdone themselves.\n“The Secretary of State is completely out of step with how damaging the two child limit is, and she demonstrated as much with her performance at yesterday’s committee hearing.\n“Charities and agencies are lining up to tell the government how reckless this policy is, that it will push 200,000 children below the poverty line, and that women claiming tax credits for a third child conceived due to rape will have to prove the point during an interview, yet no one wants to listen. This behaviour is inhumane, it is unforgivable.\n“Esther McVey is simply wrong about the rape clause. No woman should be forced to relive the experience of rape simply in order to qualify for tax credits. To endorse the existing process as in some way beneficial to the claimant is simply staggering.\n“The issue of rape is an incredibly sensitive one, and it is not being treated as such by this Tory government. The very fact that women’s aid organisations in Scotland are refusing to act as third-party referrers should be ringing serious alarm bells about the policy’s viability.\n“Unfortunately for the government, opposition to this pernicious policy continues to grow, and I look forward to joining with charities, agencies and demonstrators at the protest on Thursday. The government has performed various U-turns in recent weeks, without doubt the two child limit and rape clause should be its next. To this end I have written to the Secretary of State to ask that she meet with me, and women’s aid groups, as a matter of urgency”.\nAlison Thewliss MP Unites for Parkinsons\nAlison Thewliss, MP for Glasgow Central, has pledged to help improve the lives of people with Parkinson’s on World Parkinson’s Day (Wednesday 11 April).\nMs Thewliss’ office has signed up to take part in the Parkinson’s in the Workplace training from Parkinson’s UK. The training aims to raise awareness of the challenges people with Parkinson’s face.\nThe push for greater awareness is part of the charity’s activity to encourage people to Unite for Parkinson’s on World Parkinson’s Day, as a survey found that 32 per cent of people with Parkinson’s have been stared at in public and 11 per cent have been laughed at. In addition, 32 per cent of people do not feel that their symptoms are socially acceptable.\nParkinson’s affects 145,000 people in the UK, which is one in 350 people in Glasgow Central. With numbers of people affected expected to increase by a fifth by 2025, the charity is aiming to change attitudes about Parkinson’s to make life better for everyone living with the condition.\nThrough the training, Ms Thewliss’ office will learn more about the progressive neurological condition, the complex symptoms people face, as well as how to recognise and best support constituents with Parkinson’s.\nAlison Thewliss MP said:\n“It is shocking that people with Parkinson’s face so many barriers, including being mistaken for being drunk, when out in public.\n“My office staff and I want to take the training so that we are all better equipped to improve the lives of everyone affected by the condition in Glasgow Central and better understand the issues faced by those who come to my advice surgeries.”\nSteve Ford, Chief Executive of Parkinson’s UK, said:\n“We are thrilled that Alison Thewliss MP and their team have signed up to our Parkinson’s in the Workplace training.\n“Lack of public understanding can make simple things like getting the bus, going to work, or even heading out to the pub with friends daunting for people with Parkinson’s.\n“That’s why one small action like signing up to learn more about the condition can have a big impact on people with Parkinson’s. We look forward to seeing the difference Alison Thewliss’ support can make for their constituents in Glasgow Central.”\nAlison Thewliss MP is also backing a petition from Parkinson’s UK calling for more organisations to sign up for the training.

The UK Government introduced new measures in the Parliament in an attempt to cope with the ongoing cost-of-living crisis. The SNP’s Shadow Chancellor, Alison Thewliss MP has said that the measures don’t go far enough to mitigate the crisis and that an increase in Scotland’s block grant is necessary to combat spiralling inflation. Commenting, Alison Thewliss MP said: “The needs of devolved nations are being side-lined during this crisis. The Tory Government is wasting money on tax giveaways for the rich and major companies, instead of providing support to those who need it most. “Scotland has had a fixed budget with spending commitments in place long before the levels of inflation we are seeing. The Scottish Government is doing all it can to make sure that families across the country are not being left hungry. With no movement in this , Scotland’s hands are tied during these difficult times. “The Union is growing weaker by the day as Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are continually shut out from any notable increases in support. If Liz Truss won’t acknowledge that more funding is needed, she should devolve the powers to allow Scotland to tackle this crisis. “Scotland is an energy rich country, with a wealth of natural resources. Once again, our population is paying the price for Westminster’s failures.”",

Now Ms Thewliss is calling upon the Government to reflect upon how entirely unworkable a rape clause would be and how disastrous implementing a two child policy would be for family finances.\nCommenting after alison-thewliss-mp-response-to-rape-clause-consultation, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“As the Government consultation on the rape clause and two child policy has now closed, I would urge policy officials and Ministers to genuinely listen to the very sincere and evidence based concerns I and many others have submitted.\n“If implemented, we now know the rape clause will almost certainly mean that DWP decision makers – with little or no training – are going to be arbitrating on whether or not a woman was raped and whether or not her third or subsequent child should receive tax credits.\n“Designing a policy and consultation which asks some of the most vulnerable women in society how they would like to prove they were raped must surely be one of the most insensitive, disgusting and degrading ideas ever to emanate from Whitehall.\n“Research by the Resolution Foundation indicates that the two child policy will push an extra 200,000 children, the majority of whose families are already in-work, into child poverty by 2020. These are the very “just about managing” families that the Prime Minister claims to support.\n“Whatever way you look at this, it’s bad policy making, it will be disastrous and the Government must use this consultation response to scrap these awful proposals now.”",

Panel members sit in on children’s hearings, which operate on a rota basis, and make decisions about improving children’s lives.\nThe Children’s Hearings System was set up in 1971 to deal with children who had committed criminal offences or were in need of care and protection. Since its establishment the Children’s Panel has played an important role in upholding children’s rights and it now focuses on ensuring the protection of children who have experienced abuse and neglect or who are at serious risk of harm.\nCommenting on the campaign, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“I’m delighted to give my support to the Children’s Hearings Scotland annual recruitment drive for Children’s Panel members.\n“Children’s Panel members are trained volunteers who come from a wide range of backgrounds and sit on hearings in the local communities in which they live or work. Their dedication to securing positive results for children who are at risk of harm or exploitation is truly inspiring.\n“Being a Children’s Panel member is a great opportunity to make a difference to the lives of the most vulnerable children in Glasgow.

The #BenefitsAware campaign, launched by national charity Turn2us, aims to raise awareness of unclaimed support that those in financial hardship may be unaware of.\nNew research by the charity found that half (50%) of low income households in Scotland are not claiming the welfare benefits and tax credits they could be entitled to. This is despite the fact that a huge 86% of this group have seen no improvement to their financial situation over the last year.\nNearly three-fifths (58%) of those in Scotland who aren’t receiving this support said they had been deterred from checking or claiming potential benefits entitlements because they did not think they would be eligible. In addition, over one in ten (11%) said they were unsure of how or where to find out about this help. As a result, over three-quarters (77%) have not checked what welfare benefits they could be entitled to within the last year.\nFurthermore, over two-thirds (67%) would not consider checking their benefits entitlements if their income dropped, and only 2% would turn to a charity for help. Yet nearly two-fifths (37%) said they would cut back on gas, electricity and other essentials, and over a quarter (28%) would resort to cutting back on food.\nMs Thewliss pledged her support for the campaign at a special event in parliament this week, commenting:\n“Anyone can find themselves struggling financially and it’s really important that those needing help know where to turn. The benefits system can be a bit daunting, especially if you’ve never claimed before, which is why the Turn2us #BenefitsAware campaign is so important.\n“Over £15bn in welfare benefits went unclaimed last year with £2.8bn in Pension Credit not being taken up. It is nothing short of a tragedy that many of those who are entitled to that support are cutting back on essentials such and food or electricity, or turning to unscrupulous lenders.”\nTurn2us is urging anyone in need to use its free and confidential Benefits Calculator at Turn2us.org.uk to see what they could be entitled to and how to make a claim. The website also features information on benefits and other help for a range of different circumstances.\nSimon Hopkins, Chief Executive of Turn2us said:\n“Through our campaign, we want to show that financial hardship can happen for many different reasons and could affect anyone at any time in their lives.

The constituent contacted the DWP in September 2022 to discuss a recent UC sanction imposed upon him, asking for this to be reviewed. Due to being up late at night preparing for an upcoming job interview, the constituent slept in the following morning and missed a single appointment at the job centre. The constituent contacted the DWP one hour after the missed appointment and offered to attend later in the day however he received no response to this. Following the missed appointment, the DWP imposed a sanction in the form of £11 a day over the course of 25 days, totalling £275.

Commenting, the Glasgow Central constituent explained: “I am so delighted to have had this Universal Credit sanction overturned. This situation has been extremely stressful, and I am so relieved to be able to receive this money. “After leaving university, it has been difficult enough trying to pay the rent without sanctions such as these being put upon me. “The difficult thing for me was knowing the work and effort I was putting in to try and get a job and having all this work thrown right back in my face by an unfair sanction made the situation even worse. “Alison and her team made the process of getting this sanction overturned as stress-free as it possibly could be, and I can’t thank them enough for this. “I hope that others who might be in a similar situation will be able to see that there is hope and I would urge anyone to contact their local MP if they are experiencing issues of their own.” Commenting, Alison Thewliss MP said: “When the constituent first approached my office, it was clear that the sanction imposed upon him was extremely unfair. “My team were able to contact the DWP and received a response advising that, as expected the constituent would receive the original amount. “If constituents have been sanctioned and feel this is unfair, they are entitled to ask the decision is looked at again.

Her comments come in response to news today that Tory Ministers plan to shut fifteen more Jobcentres and back offices in Scotland, including Portcullis House and Corunna House in her Glasgow Central constituency.\nCurrently, the UK Government is already consulting on plans to close eight of Glasgow’s Jobcentres, including Bridgeton Jobcentre within Ms Thewliss’ constituency.\nAlison Thewliss MP said:\n“Last month this Tory Government delivered a body blow to communities all across our city by proposing to shut half of Glasgow’s Jobcentres. That consultation is still running and the fight to save those Jobcentres is still ongoing.\n“Now we learn that UK Ministers are planning to scrap even more of the DWP estate in Glasgow by shutting down Government back offices. This comes on the back of recent HMRC cuts in Scotland, which we were told wouldn’t happen if Scotland rejected independence in 2014. That was obviously a blatant lie.\n“These erratic Tory plans raise a number of very serious questions for Glasgow. Where are the jobs are being transferred to? What consultation has been carried out with staff? How does this fit into the current proposals to shut half of Glasgow’s Jobcentres? UK Government Ministers have been at great pains to stress the Jobcentre closures are only proposals, but how can Glaswegians trust them with these new cuts coming like a bolt from the blue?\n“I am demanding an urgent meeting with DWP Ministers to get answers on these incredibly serious questions. This Tory Government’s slash and burn approach to civil service jobs and buildings needs to stop right now.”",

The last time such a statutory instrument was annulled by the Commons using a prayer for annulment was in 1979.\nPart of the MP’s concern relates to the lack of training for the hundreds of thousands of healthcare and social work staff the Government intends to use as third party professionals. It is intended that they will judge whether a woman’s third child was born as a result of rape and thereby qualifies for an exemption to the two child policy. With just days until the policy comes into force, there is no evidence of sexual violence training having been given to public sector workers.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“Using such an underhand parliamentary tactic to railroad the rape clause into law is just the final insult this Government could possibly dish out.\n“Not only did Ministers sneak out their shameful consultation response as the eyes of the world were watching Donald Trump’s inauguration, but they’re now trying to put the rape clause on the statute books without a vote or debate, let alone any detailed scrutiny by MPs.\n“The Government must accept this policy is unworkable as well as immoral. With just days until nurses, doctors and social workers are expected to verify whether women had their third child as the result of rape, it’s clear there’s been no sexual violence training for those working with such vulnerable women. This is frankly astonishing, especially when you consider that the Government is trying to railroad this through using medieval parliamentary procedures.\n“This fight isn’t over yet.

She has also pointed out the Government’s poor preparations for implementing the policy, with no additional training offered for the thousands of healthcare professionals, police officers and social workers who will be tasked with carrying out assessments of vulnerable women and arbitrating on whether or not their circumstances are consistent with rape.\nCommenting prior to the Budget Statement, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“With under a month left until the two child policy and rape clause comes into force, it remains the case that this policy is immoral and unworkable. The public have had their say and they are clear – this policy stigmatises vulnerable women and must be consigned to the Downing Street dustbin.\n“Serious questions remain about the implementation of the policy, with hundreds of thousands of third party professionals left without the promised training in the policy, and growing opposition from civil servants’ unions. The UK Government is still to introduce the necessary legislation to allow the policy to proceed in 23 days’ time, which underlines my belief that Ministers are slowly realising that this policy is a cruel and unfeasible way to cut benefits.\n“With his upcoming budget, the Chancellor has a critical opportunity to save face for this heartless Government and ditch the two child policy and rape clause.

My Bill aims to give parents the access to the best quality information about formula milks so that they can make the right decisions when feeding their babies and young children.\nI was delighted that the Bill cleared its first parliamentary hurdle and its Second Reading will be taking place on 24th February 2017.\nUpdate – 9th January 2017\nMany thanks to all those who took part in my consultation on my draft proposals for the Feeding Products for Babies and Children (Advertising and Promotion) Bill. We received a fantastic number of responses, which we will consider carefully for inclusion in the Bill’s contents. An update on the outcome of the consultation will be published prior to the Bill’s Second Reading on 24th February 2017.\nUpdate – 29th January 2017\nI have now published an analysis of the responses to the consultation document. I received over 300 responses with people from across all walks of life and from across their world giving me their views on marketing of formula milk and I am grateful to all those who took their time to take part in the consultation. I will now be drafting the Bill prior to its Second Reading on Friday 24th February.\nUpdate – 22nd February 2017\nThe Bill has now been published, taking into account the suggestions provided by those that responded to my consultation. If passed into law, my bill will:\n- Introduce plain packaging for all formula milks;\n- Establish a body, totally independent of industry, to test all products and verify the claims of manufacturers prior to them being licensed for sale;\n- Ban the use of misleading terms such as “follow-on” or “growing-up” formula milks;\n- Stop companies from circumventing existing laws by introducing a ban on identical packaging for stage two and subsequent products;\n- Prohibit formula companies from advertising in health journals and magazines;\n- Bring forward tougher penalties for companies who flaunt the legislation, including greater financial fines and prison sentences for company CEOs;\n- Ban advertising of formula milks on TV, social media, the internet and through parenting clubs.\nYou can read the Bill online and follow its progress through the House of Commons. You can also watch my interview with BBC Breakfast explaining why the Bill is necessary and what it will do to provide parents with the right nutritional information for feeding their babies and clamp down on misleading claims by formula milk companies in packaging and advertising their products.",

Mr O’Donnell explained that he had been pursuing the PIP claim for several years but was yet to receive any answer on the matter.\nThe constituent asked for a Legal Entitlements and Administrative Practices (LEAP) review as he believed his mobility element may have been miscalculated due to having agoraphobia.\nA letter from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) was sent to confirm that the matter was being investigated and an update would be provided in due course.\nAfter years of patience, Mr O’Donnell was informed by the DWP that he would be given a payment of £9191.41. This payment was calculated using the PIP payments he received and those he is now entitled to for the period 23 March 2016 until 7 June 2022.\nCommenting on his delight at receiving this payment, Michael O’Donnell said:\n“I can’t thank Alison and her team enough for the support they have given me in this case. The patience and dedication shown by the team is something which I am extremely grateful for.\n“I have been trying for years to get this PIP payment but to get it after such a long period of waiting has been such a relief.\n“The amount of money I have received is truly life-changing and will help greatly in the lead up to Christmas.\n“Since getting this money, I have spoken with several friends to urge them to speak with Alison about any issue they have due to how helpful she has been in this process.\n“The process was much easier than I expected, and I will be forever grateful to the team for making sure that I was given this life-changing amount of money.”\nCommenting on this case, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“I am so happy that Michael was able to receive this payment. After approaching our office in June, it was clear he had been waiting a long time for this payment which he was owed.\n“While my team spoke with the DWP, Michael was so patient and understood the issues we faced in this case.\n“I also want to extend a thanks to the DWP, who were also very helpful in this issue and were in regular dialogue with my team about this case.\n“As Michael said, this amount of money will no doubt make a huge difference to his life, and it brings me such great pride to be able to help the constituent in this way.”\nThewliss supports Royal Life Saving Society UK’s Drowning Prevention Week\nLast week, the Royal Life Saving Society UK (RLSS UK), the national charity and leader in lifesaving and lifeguarding training across the UK and Ireland, brought its annual Drowning Prevention Week campaign to Westminster.\nAlison Thewliss came together with the RLSS UK CEO and Charity Director, lifeguards, Olympian Professor Greg Whyte OBE, Paralympian Ellie Robinson MBE, and over 50 other Parliamentarians to discuss the importance of spreading water safety awareness, as well as what practical steps could be taken in Glasgow Central to address the issue.\nAt the event, Thewliss had the chance to see this guidance first-hand, including how to use throw lines, how to respect bodies of water, among other resources and also check out the cutting-edge equipment that is now being used to keep our shorelines and lakes safer than ever.\nThe RLSS UK also showed MPs the charity’s brand-new animation aimed at educating parents and their children about water safety and starting conversations of how their family can enjoy the water safely this summer.\nOver 400 people die every year in the UK and Ireland from accidental drowning, yet every drowning is avoidable. Of those who drown, some 40% had no intention of entering the water in the first place. Yet people should still feel free to enjoy the water, as with the correct education and awareness, this can be done safely.\nDrowning Prevention Week, which began on 18th June and continues until 25th June, encourages the public to be ready to enjoy being in, on, or around water this summer by ensuring that they and their families have a good understanding of water safety.\nLee Heard, Charity Director at RLSS UK said:\n“With June, July, and August proving to be the months with the most fatalities, it is vitally important that everyone understands water safety, especially during the summer months.\n“We want to ensure that everyone can enjoy their summer break and enjoy being in or around water but be safe in the knowledge that they, and their children, have the skills and understanding about water safety, which could potentially save a life.”\n“It is fantastic to have Alison Thewliss supporting our Drowning Prevention Week campaign and highlighting the issues surrounding water safety education and helping to educate communities in Glasgow Central.”\nOlympian Professor Greg Whyte OBE, said:\n“I have been privileged to work with the Royal Life Saving Society UK for many years, as we strive to spread awareness around water safety and help people to enjoy water safely.\n“Every MP who came along to our event, and who helps us spread the message and awareness of this important campaign is helping us reach our ultimate goal of zero water deaths, and for that I am grateful.”\nParalympian Ellie Robinson MBE, said:\n“While swimming ability is of course crucial, far more worrying is the statistic that some 40% of people who drown had no intention of entering the water in the first place. Only by spreading greater awareness of water safety can we help people to enjoy water safely and reduce fatalities.”\nThe event came quickly after the inaugural meeting of the All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) for Water Safety. This took place earlier this month and aims to establish more accessible water safety education across the UK to prevent future drownings.\nDamien Moore MP, Chair of the APPG on Water Safety, said:\n“Every drowning is a tragedy, and despite the RLSS UK’s excellent education campaign having reached an estimated 20 million people across the UK, these horrific accidents continue to happen.\n“It is my sincerest hope that by hosting this event in Parliament, we have helped to further spread awareness of how best to enjoy water safely, so that ultimately lives can be saved.\n“I want to thank the RLSS UK, along with every MP who came along to our event, for the vital work that they are doing in spreading awareness.”\nTHEWLISS DEMANDS IMMEDIATE ACTION ON FOOTBALL INDEX IN PARLIAMENTARY DEBATE\nAlison Thewliss, Shadow Chancellor for the SNP and MP for Glasgow Central, has demanded that the Government takes immediate action on collapsed betting company, Football Index.\nA debate was held today, Tuesday 6th June, on the impact of the collapse of the company, which took place in March of 2021. The company had its licence stripped by the Gambling Commission and was forced to enter administration.\nIt has been estimated that customers collectively have over £90 million in open stakes trapped in the platform following its collapse – leaving average losses of around £3,000 per customer.\nFollowing confirmation that a debate would be taking place on the company, Thewliss has demanded that the time is now to ensure the customers affected by the collapse are compensated for.\nAlison Thewliss MP said:\n“The Government have been tiptoeing around the issue of Football Index for over a year now. Constituents in Glasgow Central have contacted my office and explained the distress they felt, having invested significant money into the company. They now feel completely betrayed by the lack of support following the collapse, and frustrated by the lack of action by regulators.\n“A support package must be put in place for victims of the scandal, particularly given the precedent set by the UK Government on the London Capital and Finance failure. It is entirely unfair that those who continue to have money locked away in the accounts of the now-collapsed firm are being left in the dark.\n“There remains a real worry that scandals such as Football Index could be repeated unless action is taken by the Gambling Commission. The Government must acknowledge the recommendations made by Michael Sheehan QC and implement these as soon as possible.\n“I am deeply disappointed that the Minister didn’t recognise that the Football Index scandal isn’t about people being compensated for gambling losses – it is a clear failure in regulation. On that basis, compensation should be due to those that have lost their life savings to a government-regulated Ponzi scheme.”\nTHEWLISS PLEDGES SUPPORT FOR IMPROVING LIVER HEALTH IN SCOTLAND\nGlasgow Central MP Alison Thewliss demonstrated her support for improving liver health in Scotland by attending the Love Your Liver roadshow, hosted by the British Liver Trust, in Glasgow on Thursday 19th May 2022.\nMs Thewliss is an advocate for the British Liver Trust’s work and recognises the importance of improving early diagnosis of liver disease. She encouraged her constituents and the people of Glasgow to attend the roadshow and find out the steps they can take to improve their liver health.\n90% of liver disease is preventable and if caught at an early stage liver damage can be reversed. However, the alarming reality is that three-quarters of people with cirrhosis are diagnosed when it is too late for effective intervention or treatment.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said: “I am delighted to support the Love Your Liver campaign and the charity’s work to improve early detection. Liver disease is a public health crisis and thousands of Scots are at risk. The Love Your Liver roadshow is a really important campaign, which is helping people better understand the importance of looking after their liver.”\nMembers of the public were encouraged to pop along to the Love Your Liver mobile unit in Argyle street to take a free liver screener, which assesses the potential for liver damage against the three main risk factors of alcohol, obesity and viral hepatitis. A free FibroScan was offered to those who had a potential risk and those with high readings were recommended to speak to their GP.\nScotland has a significant liver disease crisis with around 900 deaths each year. In 2020, it was one of the leading causes of death in Scotland in those under the age of 75. Mortality rates are also four times higher in deprived areas compared to more affluent areas.\nPamela Healy OBE, Chief Executive of British Liver Trust, said: “One in five of us are at risk of liver disease and the numbers of people being diagnosed have been increasing at an alarming rate. Liver damage develops silently with no signs or symptoms and people often don’t realise they have a problem until it is too late. Although the liver is remarkably resilient, if left until symptoms appear, the damage is often irreversible.\n“Our Love Your Liver roadshows are a great opportunity for people to find out their risk of liver disease and receive a free liver scan to see if there is any early damage. Approximately one in five people that are scanned are advised to have further checks.”\nThe British Liver Trust’s Love Your Liver campaign focuses on three simple steps for liver health:\n1. Drink within recommended limits and have three consecutive days off alcohol every week\n2. Cut down on sugar, carbohydrates and fat, and take more exercise\n3. Know the risk factors for viral hepatitis and get tested or vaccinated if at risk\nYou can find out if you are at risk and check your liver health online by doing the online screening test at https://www.britishlivertrust.org.uk/screener\nFor more If you couldn’t attend the events you can still find out if you are at risk and check your liver information on our Roadshows, visit: Love Your Liver Roadshows\nTHEWLISS CALLS ON IMMEDIATE GOVERNMENT ACTION ON PASSPORT WAITING TIMES\nAlison Thewliss, MP for Glasgow Central, has called upon the Government to step in immediately to stop the rising waiting times for passport applications.\nHer Majesty’s Passport Office has warned that applicants for new passports should “be prepared” for significant delays to applications in the coming months.\nThe impact of the pandemic saw over five million people delaying their renewal of passports between 2020 and 2021. With travel returning back to normal, applications for new passports for travellers are now reaching record highs.\nSpeaking on the impact of these delays, Thewliss described how difficult it has been for Glasgow Central constituents to receive their passports after applying for them.\nAlison Thewliss said:\n“Glasgow Central constituents have been contacting me to express their concerns over lengthy delays from the Passport Office – despite applications going in months ago.\n“With a huge backlog of applications to deal with after the pandemic, I completely appreciate how difficult it must be for the workers in these offices to process the requests in a timely manner. I am hopeful that the UK Government will acknowledge the pressure being put on Passport Offices across the country and employ more people to deal with the backlog of cases.\n“I am deeply concerned, however, by accounts from my constituents of being let down and lied to about their applications during a time of stress and uncertainty for them. One constituent in particular, Scott came to me with a list of false information he was given in relation to his passport application.\n“This ranged from being told people could go to collect their passport, which he said was not possible, to being told he would only need to wait 10 weeks to receive his passport, despite eventually waiting 12 weeks to receive it.\n“It is clear that there is immense pressure being put on Passport Offices across the country, but it remains completely unacceptable that my constituents are being given a false sense of hope during a time where they will no doubt be extremely nervous about being able to receive their passport in time.\n“The Government must ensure that the information being provided by Passport Offices is honest and accurate.”",

These children have been through so much – fleeing conflict and persecution. I’m glad that the UK can help provide them with a safe home and a fresh start.”\n“As winter sets in I’m remain concerned about the plight of child refugees in Europe who are all alone and have no family with them.

The pain, fatigue and lack of mobility caused by arthritis affects every aspect of a person’s life, making everyday tasks such as making a cup of tea, travelling to work or getting out of bed extremely difficult.\nAs well as the personal impact, the cost to NHS Scotland for hip fractures alone exceeds £73 million per year, and these conditions are the cause of one in five working days lost in the UK.\nAlison Thewliss MP, pictured at Arthritis Research UK’s annual Parliamentary reception, has pledged to support Arthritis Research UK’s Prevent, Transform, Cure manifesto in Parliament as an Arthritis Champion, which calls for:\n- Making arthritis and musculoskeletal conditions a public health priority\n- Ensuring people have timely access to health and care services that enable them to improve their musculoskeletal health\n- Ensure people with arthritis and musculoskeletal conditions have fair and timely access to services that support them to be in work, including financial support\n- Protect the UK’s position as a global leader in science and sustain the benefits of the life-science sector to the economy\nSpeaking about becoming an Arthritis Champion, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“I’m proud to champion Arthritis Research UK’s policy calls to tackle the prevention, transformation and cure of arthritis.

A life threatening and relatively unknown condition, which claims the lives of 44,000 people – including 1,000 children – every year in the UK. The event, hosted by the APPG on Sepsis and the UK Sepsis Trust, was attend by over 40 MPs and Peers, along with a number of patients and their families who have been personally affected by sepsis.\nSepsis is a life-threatening condition that can affect anyone. It arises when the body’s response to an infection damages its own tissues and organs. It can lead to shock, multiple organ failure, and death, especially if it is not recognised early and treated promptly.\nIn a bid to reduce deaths like these, the UK Sepsis Trust (UKST) and the APPG on Sepsis are calling for both the public and healthcare professionals to be more aware of this ‘silent killer’. They are calling for the Department of Health to commit to a public awareness campaign, aimed at both adults and children solely on sepsis.\nThe UK Sepsis Trust, founded in 2010, brings together leading experts, grass roots health professionals, survivors and persons bereaved; to raise public and professional awareness of sepsis, and provide support for those affected by this terrible condition.\nDr Ron Daniels, Chief Executive of the UK Sepsis Trust, said:\n“We hope that the event will allow MPs to learn more about sepsis and take the message back to their colleagues and constituents.”\n“An awareness campaign is something we’ve been calling for a long time. It is an absolute necessity that this campaign is dedicated on sepsis and aimed at a both adults and children. A campaign of course is only a part of what is needed. We need to make sure that healthcare professional education is robust and is mandated. We need to have a better measure of outcomes and we have to have some resources available that reward excellent care.”\nAlison Thewliss MP stated:\n“While sepsis is a condition which may not hit the headlines, it is deadly. It is a little known life threatening illness that claims the lives of 44,000 people in the UK every year, including 1,000 children. If timely interventions proposed by the UK Sepsis Trust were adopted across the NHS it could save up to 12,500 lives a year and the NHS money.”\n“I was keen to show my support for efforts to tackle the disease and save lives. I want to see sepsis viewed as a medical emergency and have a higher profile among medical professionals and the public. The easiest and most of effective way of doing this is the government committing to a dedicated public awareness campaign for the general population.”\nI am still in recovery from\nSepsis and i can honestly say its the worst health scare i have had. Thankfully i knew my own body and knew by day 2 that i was really quite unwell but clueless as to what it was. I attended the out of hours and it all took off from there i was on IV antibiotics for 5 days in hospital, i had to go thru to lumbar punctures, a ct scan and a chest xray, numerous blood tests a day and bags of fluids for dehydration. I went to bed feeling a 100% healthy and woke up really ill thats how quickly it happened. I am just thankful that i went to hospital when i did if i had left it another day or so i might not be here writing this. It has left me fatigued and feeling quite vulnerable. I fully support this",
  "http_www_alisonthewliss_scot/https_www_alisonthewliss_scot_mp-raises-pensioner-winter-fuel-payment-debacle/content_134.html": "Alison Thewliss, SNP MP for Glasgow Central, is calling upon the UK Government to urgently review the computer system which allocates winter fuel payments to pensioners.\nA recent constituency case raised with Ms Thewliss suggests that pensioners living in properties, such as tenements and tower blocks, are losing out because the system is – wrongly – factoring in other people in the building when calculating the total winter fuel payment due.\nIn Ms Thewliss’ constituent’s case, this resulted in one pensioner only receiving half of his winter fuel payment because the system, wrongly, counted other residents in his close when, in fact, the constituent in question lives on his own. Rather than receiving the £200 payment, he only received half, which was eventually rectified following his MP’s intervention.\nThe Glasgow Central MP has written to Work & Pensions Secretary, Iain Duncan Smith, to ask for a full investigation into the system.\nAlison Thewliss, MP for Glasgow Central, said:\n“My constituent’s case highlights a serious anomaly within the UK Government’s winter fuel payment scheme, whereby potentially thousands of pensioners are being underpaid their winter fuel payments. All of this is because the Government’s system doesn’t always recognise buildings with multiple flats. I’ve written to Iain Duncan Smith to ask for a full investigation into this issue and to specifically ask for an urgent review of the payment system which seems to discriminate against buildings with more than one residence.\n“My own research shows that Glasgow alone has over 220,000 properties which comprise of flats, tenements and tower blocks. In my own constituency, over 45,000 properties are part of multi-dwelling properties. Now, of course, not all of those properties will be entitled to winter fuel payments but it does give you an idea of the scale of this problem in a city which is, after all, renowned for its red sandstone tenements.\n“Figures from Age UK show that an eye watering £3.7 billion in benefits already goes unclaimed by elderly people in the UK and I’m concerned that this is another example of older people not getting what they’re due.\n“As temperatures continue to plummet this January, we simply cannot continue on with the perverse scenario, whereby pensioners living in flats are possibly being undercut because of an anomaly in the DWP’s payment system.”\nRead with interest the winter fuel payments problems which affect pensioners who DWP hold incorrect details for In my case DWP started to correspond with me at my previous address when I became of state pension age despite having paid previous years payments correctly at my current address in November 2013/14/15 after being informed by letter when payment would be made\nMy main concern was that once they were made aware of the underpayment I was advised that no clerical action to pay the balance would even begin until at least Jan 2017\nAt the lifestyle and budgeting level this is more than inconvenient as the energy companies won’t want to hear of the circumstances that may put my account in arrears so like many people the heating will be have to be used sparingly………….\nMy comments are not for any action on my behalf but just to increase your knowledge bank……..\nI will get through… but wonder how others cope with a system that can make simple errors that have this level of consequence……\nHappy New year…..to you and yours\nUpdate as at 18/01/2017\nBy Clive\nAfter telephone contact with DWP no one is able to tell me a time scale for the payment to address my underpayment…..They confirm that they are now using the correct details and a payment will be made but will only say it will be before the end of March 2017!!!!!!!\nComment: As usual “Their error” but I suffer………\nExpedite sooner rather than later seem a concept that their system is incapable of……\nI don’t want special treatment I just want to be a bit warmer in winter rather than Spring time.\nAnother year same problem Despite checking and being assured verbally that my details that qualify me for this years winter were correct The DWP managed for the second year in a row to under pay me and actually paid funds into my bank account two weeks before I received a letter informing me of the payment at a previous address which is not my qualifing address. Last years underpayment took three and a half months to sort out, so enough is enough as their system cannot seem to cope to deliver a outcome that is expected by any right minded person in a timely manner I plan to raise a simple cause action and have a sherriff decide to impose a court order to recover the monies owed to me as a debt. I am loath to proceed in this manner but feel that the DWP flawed systems should not disadvantage anyone\nI will report my progress….",

She has hailed CCG’s house building techniques as being revolutionary and a model which others should look to.\nCCG has a well-developed model of building timber properties within its Glasgow factory.

CCG have worked hard to make house building more efficient, dramatically reducing the time taken to construct new homes.\n“CCG is a remarkable firm based in Glasgow with over 600 employees and a turnover of £120 million per year. I was particularly impressed with the strong emphasis they’ve put on training and apprenticeships, which will go some way to dealing with some of the skills shortages within the construction industry.\n“As the CLG committee continues to look at capacity in the housebuilding industry, I am very hopeful that we’ll be able to take a closer look at the impressive work CCG is doing in Scotland.”",

The Bill, presented by Geraint Davies MP, follows a report from the Royal Colleges that diesel fumes cause 40,000 premature deaths every year from lung cancer, strokes and heart disease. Diesel fumes also lead to underdevelopment in children and impact on foetuses, among other health effects.\nThe Air Quality Bill makes provisions for emissions testing to reflect on-road driving conditions, and assessment at the point of MOTs. The Bill also empowers local authorities to designate low emissions zones and pedestrianisation, and promotes cleaner public transport alternatives such as tram systems and LPG-powered vehicles.\nThe Environment Agency would be able to step in when a pollution cloud has hit an area, so that windows, doors and even roads can be closed, and if necessary local people evacuated until it is safe to return.\nAlison Thewliss MP said, “Diesel pollution causes 40,000 deaths a year, and costs £20bn according to the Royal College of Physicians. That is why I am supporting the Air Quality Bill, published today, which aims to save thousands of lives and billions of pounds. This is achieved through effective emissions testing, following the Volkswagen emissions scandal and promoting greener transport systems and vehicles.\n“Local residents in Glasgow are rightly concerned about their children coughing and wheezing, especially if children are already asthmatic. We now know that these health effects, and indeed thousands of deaths, are caused by toxic diesel fumes, which is why I am keen to support this important Bill.”\nGeraint Davies MP, who published the Bill, said “Our cities are pumping out diesel clouds which threaten the lives of families, in particular young children and unborn babies. The Bill will ensure reliable vehicle emissions testing, new powers for councils to clean up local air, and a focus in the Budget on sustainable transport. This will help save thousands of lives and billions of pounds lost to diesel pollution.”\nDr Penny Woods, Chief Executive of the British Lung Foundation, said: “Air pollution causes tens of thousands of early deaths every year, increases the risk of lung cancer and impairs child lung development. Geraint Davies’ Bill further highlights these unacceptable dangers to the nation’s lung health. Immediate action must be taken by the government.”",

Far from showing contrition, the Secretary of State instead posited that the policy offers “double support”.\nA demonstration against the two child policy – one year since its implementation – will be held on Thursday 19 April at 5.30pm, on The Mound, Edinburgh.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“I didn’t think the Tory government could sink any lower on this issue, but they have once again outdone themselves.\n“The Secretary of State is completely out of step with how damaging the two child limit is, and she demonstrated as much with her performance at yesterday’s committee hearing.\n“Charities and agencies are lining up to tell the government how reckless this policy is, that it will push 200,000 children below the poverty line, and that women claiming tax credits for a third child conceived due to rape will have to prove the point during an interview, yet no one wants to listen. This behaviour is inhumane, it is unforgivable.\n“Esther McVey is simply wrong about the rape clause. No woman should be forced to relive the experience of rape simply in order to qualify for tax credits. To endorse the existing process as in some way beneficial to the claimant is simply staggering.\n“The issue of rape is an incredibly sensitive one, and it is not being treated as such by this Tory government. The very fact that women’s aid organisations in Scotland are refusing to act as third-party referrers should be ringing serious alarm bells about the policy’s viability.\n“Unfortunately for the government, opposition to this pernicious policy continues to grow, and I look forward to joining with charities, agencies and demonstrators at the protest on Thursday.

They also facilitate more informal groups on gardening, music, creative writing and cookery.\nMs Thewliss had a chance to meet with some of the refugees who use the service and hear their experiences of interacting with the Home Office.\nSpeaking after her visit to the Adelphi Centre, where the project is based, Ms Thewliss said:\n“I was really grateful for the opportunity to visit Freedom from Torture this morning. The work they do to support some of the most vulnerable asylum seekers in our country is heart-warming and ensures refugees get the love and support they need after such awful ordeals.\n“The opportunity to listen to the experiences and testimony of the refugees was incredibly moving – particularly regarding some of the ill-treatment at the hands of the UK Home Office. I cannot help but conclude that traumatic situations are exacerbated by an uncaring and cold hearted Home Office, which is clearly ill equipped to deal with survivors of torture. It is so important that survivors of torture have their cases heard properly, particularly when Freedom from Torture have provided expert medico-legal evidence to support their claim. I’ll certainly be taking this up with the Home Office to ensure survivors of torture are treated with more respect, sensitivity and dignity.”",

The MPs were putting their case for lifting the ban on asylum seekers to work.\nDespite a number of attempts from MPs to intervene on the Minister, Sarah Newton, they were told that there was not enough time to take interventions or questions. The Minister then closed the debate early without addressing many of the points raised by MPs.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“Today I outlined the societal and economic benefits of lifting the ban on asylum seekers working. Valid points were raised by Conservative, Labour and SNP MPs, all of which were ducked by the Minister.\n“I am not sure whether the Minister responding didn’t know her brief or if she was genuinely trying to shut down legitimate questions about the fallacy of the current policy.\n“Frustratingly, the Government merely repeated the usual right wing rhetoric we’re so used to hearing when it comes to asylum and immigration policy.\n“Despite a contemptable performance from the Minister today, the SNP won’t be letting go of this issue. The case for lifting the ban on asylum seekers working is both morally and economically justified. Had the Minister allowed the debate to run for the full allotted time today, she might have started to understand that”.\nI couldn’t agree more Alison. Could it be that there are vested interests here in NOT doing anything that enables asylum seekers to demonstrate the undoubted skills, talent and expertise that very many of them possess? Let’s face it, that wouldn’t sit well alongside the attitude that the current government seems to embrace. Heaven forbid that certain sections of the British people start to see asylum seekers as able to contribute earlier to economic development and that they could so easily be able to be financially independent of state aid.",

Contrast this, for example, to the Scottish Government’s weighty white paper which was in place long before the Scottish independence referendum.\n“Leaving the EU was always, sadly, a possible outcome when the UK Government legislated for a referendum. The Prime Minister is only now, belatedly and hurriedly, setting up a new department in Whitehall to plan for Brexit. That’s just not good enough; a degree of certainty is crucial for all organisations to plan for the months and years ahead.\n“The Prime Minister must make it a top priority to get around the country, visit the businesses and organisations who’ll be affected by Brexit, and obtain answers about what this dreadful decision will mean for them”.\nA transcript of the exchange:\nAlison Thewliss MP: The Prime Minister said that we are entitled to all the benefits of EU membership up until the point at which we leave. Can I clarify if there has been any discussions about access to EU funding, such as Regional Selective Assistance which has created and safeguarded 10,000 jobs and been worth £83 million to Glasgow since 2010 and the terms and conditions of loans issued by the European Investment Bank, which also provided significant amounts of money and require some clarity for local authorities involved in the loans.\nPrime Minister: What I can say is that any contract entered into before Britain leaves the EU should be honoured in full in terms of EU funding for research or for regions of our country. The status we have with respect to the European Investment Bank will have to be determined as part of the negotiations and that is the sort of technical issue that the [dedicated] Whitehall unit can look at now and see what the options are so that we can discuss them in this House.",

Of those who drown, some 40% had no intention of entering the water in the first place. Yet people should still feel free to enjoy the water, as with the correct education and awareness, this can be done safely.\nDrowning Prevention Week, which began on 18th June and continues until 25th June, encourages the public to be ready to enjoy being in, on, or around water this summer by ensuring that they and their families have a good understanding of water safety.\nLee Heard, Charity Director at RLSS UK said:\n“With June, July, and August proving to be the months with the most fatalities, it is vitally important that everyone understands water safety, especially during the summer months.\n“We want to ensure that everyone can enjoy their summer break and enjoy being in or around water but be safe in the knowledge that they, and their children, have the skills and understanding about water safety, which could potentially save a life.”\n“It is fantastic to have Alison Thewliss supporting our Drowning Prevention Week campaign and highlighting the issues surrounding water safety education and helping to educate communities in Glasgow Central.”\nOlympian Professor Greg Whyte OBE, said:\n“I have been privileged to work with the Royal Life Saving Society UK for many years, as we strive to spread awareness around water safety and help people to enjoy water safely.\n“Every MP who came along to our event, and who helps us spread the message and awareness of this important campaign is helping us reach our ultimate goal of zero water deaths, and for that I am grateful.”\nParalympian Ellie Robinson MBE, said:\n“While swimming ability is of course crucial, far more worrying is the statistic that some 40% of people who drown had no intention of entering the water in the first place. Only by spreading greater awareness of water safety can we help people to enjoy water safely and reduce fatalities.”\nThe event came quickly after the inaugural meeting of the All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) for Water Safety.

It features 10 short chapters from 29 bereaved young people talking through their experience of coping with the gap their friend has left, trying to adapt their lives without them by their side and finding a ‘new normal’.\nThe booklet – which was launched during CRY’s annual Raising Awareness Week [19-26 November] – is part of a wider campaign #CRY4Friends, highlighting the grief felt by young people when they experience the death of a friend. www.cry4friends.org.uk\nAlison Cox says; “This powerful and deeply sensitive booklet articulating the thoughts and feelings of the sudden death of a fit and healthy special friend explains the ferocity of the impact of the loss.

Independence is the only way Scotland can escape austerity for good.“The fact that almost 335,000 deaths – almost 20,000 in Scotland – are likely to have been caused by UK government policies should serve as a wake up call to the UK government and shame every single Tory to their core, including Douglas Ross and the rest of the Scottish Tories.“The UK government had the opportunity to change course in its recent mini-budget by scrapping debt-inducing policies and bringing in meaningful, targeted support to help low and middle income families get through the cost-of-living crisis. Instead, it chose to confirm Tory austerity 2.0 with more cuts that will threaten our vital NHS and public services, scrap the cap on bankers bonuses and, before u-turning, cut tax for the wealthiest. “It is time for the Scottish Conservative Party to stand up for people in Scotland and help to save lives across the country by denouncing the Tory austerity agenda and calling on their boss to uprate benefits as promised, so people aren’t left cold or hungry.“Scotland hasn’t voted for a Tory government in almost 60 years, yet we have had cruel Tory policy after cruel Tory policy imposed on us – and now we see those same policies are likely causing excess deaths here. It is truly heartbreaking – but we can have a brighter, safer future with independence, which would give us all the powers needed to ensure people weren’t left to go cold and hungry.”",

Today we got more heat than light from the Government.\n“Despite spending a significant proportion of my speech laying out concerns about the principle and operation of the two child policy and the rape clause, the Minister made no attempt whatsoever to address these issues.\n“The Minister failed to take on board well founded and legitimate concerns about the Government’s third party reporting mechanism, and couldn’t give any guarantees how this would work. That is shocking when you consider the policy was announced over 400 days ago.\n“The other red herring today was this same tired line that the Government will be consulting with stakeholders, but this has been incredibly limited in scope so far. Charities such as Stepchange Debt Charity, Child Poverty Action Group and Scottish Women’s Aid have all criticised the policy.\n“In light of the fact that the Government is clearly unwilling to meaningfully engage – and do so publicly – on this deeply worrying policy, I will now be pushing ahead to organise a major event at Westminster which will bring together women’s welfare groups, rape crisis charities, faith communities and welfare charities.

Minister are now unleashing untold chaos and poverty for some of the most vulnerable women and families in this country – indeed, the very “just about managing” families Theresa May spoke about upon taking office as Prime Minister.\n“As of midnight last night, a two child limit on child tax credits and universal credit – which is tantamount to social engineering – came into force. It largely penalises families who are already in work, so this has very little to do with reducing the welfare bill but is, instead, an ideological attack on the lowest earning families in our society.\n“Independent analysis shows that the two child limit alone will mean a loss of up to £2,800 every year per child for hardworking families. If you had a third child at 11.59pm last night, over the next 18 years you could be £50,000 better off than a family whose third child was born a minute later.\n“Analysis also shows that well over 200,000 children will now move into relative poverty as a result of this deeply flawed two child limit. We should be reducing child poverty, not adding hundreds of thousands more to this miserable statistic.\n“What’s most horrifying is the rape clause, which is a vile policy in total chaos. Ministers are willing to give an exemption to those women whose third child was conceived as a result of rape, but they want them to prove this in a traumatic assessment from healthcare professionals and social workers. This is utterly appalling and will only seek to make rape survivors relive the trauma and brutality of the sexual violence they experienced at the hands of their perpetrator. It must be one of the most inhumane and barbaric policies ever to emanate from Whitehall.\n“The rape clause has been found, even today, as being totally unworkable, with wholly inadequate guidance sneaked out during the night. There has been no proper sexual violence awareness training for healthcare professionals and social workers who’ve been asked to arbitrate on whether a woman’s child was conceived as a result of rape.\n“Ministers have ducked and dived at every turn to try and avoid talking about this policy, presumably because they know it’s so unpalatable. The UK government railroaded this through Parliament using a statutory instrument which meant MPs couldn’t vote upon or debate it. It’s all well and good that the UK government has now conceded that this will need to be referred to a Delegated Legislation Committee when Parliament returns after the Easter recess. However, the fact remains, the policy is now live and will cause untold distress.

However, little is currently known about the exact numbers, location and needs of this significant group. Including new questions on the next census would provide public bodies, local authorities, and charities with valuable information to ensure they are able to deliver the best services they can for our Armed Forces community.\nMs Thewliss met with representatives of The Royal British Legion, veterans and Service personnel to discuss the campaign in Parliament on Monday 13 June.\nMs Thewliss said of the meeting: “It was a pleasure to meet with members of the Armed Forces community who, along with their families, make huge sacrifices in the service of our country. I also enjoyed meeting with staff from The Royal British Legion and hearing more about their Count Them In campaign.\nI was very disappointed to learn that we currently know more about the UK’s Jedi community than we do about our Armed Forces. It cannot be right that our Servicemen and women, veterans and their families are effectively hidden from official statistics, and that’s why I’m backing the call for new questions to be added to the next UK Census. We count on them – let’s count them in.”\nChris Simpkins, Director-General of The Royal British Legion, said: “As a nation we promise to provide lifelong care and support for those who serve our country. By adding questions to the 2021 UK Census, we can help public bodies and charities deliver the best services they can for our Armed Forces community, when and where it is needed most. We thank Alison for adding her support to our campaign: together I’m confident that we can make the next census count for our Armed Forces community”\nConstituents can find out more about the campaign by visiting the campaign website, www.britishlegion.org.uk/census, or by posting their own pledge of support on social media using the #CountThemIn hashtag.",

Instead however, the UK Government has actively chosen to restrict these benefits since 2015. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation has previously estimated that the measure will push half a million families over the poverty line by 2020.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“The callousness of this Tory government never ceases to shock me. It is truly appalling that they have presided over a freeze on working-age benefits for hundreds of thousands of people across the country, while living costs have increased.\n“It seems that the UK Government will pursue a budget surplus at any cost, and if that means forcing thousands of families below the poverty line, then so be it. This is purely ideological and cruel, and it must stop.\n“The Tories have rightfully received harsh scrutiny on their shambolic Universal Credit policy, but the benefit freeze could potentially be even more damaging to low-income families.\n“In September this year, inflation stood at 2.4%, meaning that everything is 2.4% more expensive than it was 12 months ago. The Institute of Fiscal Studies has estimated that this will translate to a £150 shortfall in household budgets over a 12 month period, leading to families being up to £800 a year worse off by 2020.\n“Theresa May has the audacity to say that austerity is over. It certainly isn’t in my constituency.\n“This government has form when it comes to balancing the books on the backs of low-earners, but to perpetuate a benefits freeze – particularly against the backdrop of the Brexit shambles – would be particularly malevolent. I urge the Chancellor to lift the freeze, and to give ordinary people a break”.",

More than four in 10 (42%) do not feel their overall care is well-managed and well-coordinated. This suggests people living with incurable breast cancer are not getting the care and support they need.\nIn addition, a report from the charity reveals that, despite it being mandatory since 2013, a fifth (19%) of Hospital Trusts are not collecting any data about the number of people diagnosed with incurable breast cancer. And almost half (47%) are not recording the numbers fully.\nBreast Cancer Care believes incomplete data for the number of people with incurable breast cancer is one of the major barriers to urgently needed improvements to poor care.\nAhead of Secondary Breast Cancer Awareness Day , attended Breast Cancer Care’s parliamentary event – hosted by Sharon Hodgson MP, co-chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Breast Cancer and new Shadow Public Health Minister – to meet women living with incurable breast cancer and call for an end to second-rate care.\nCommenting on the campaign, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“It is so important to show my support for women living with incurable secondary breast cancer.

  "http_www_alisonthewliss_scot/https_www_alisonthewliss_scot_page_21/content_759.html": "(This blog was published on the Heritage Lottery Fund’s website on 23/09/16)\nThe name of the city I am proud to represent, Glasgow, derives its meaning from the old Gaelic word Glasgu, meaning “dear green place”.\nGlasgow is home to over 90 parks (eight award winning) and gardens. That’s more than 1,900 acres of land – 25% of the Glasgow area as a whole.\nProtecting our parks and green spaces is of paramount importance to the health and wellbeing of the city of Glasgow, and many of these themes are picked up in the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) report State of UK Public Parks 2016.\nThe report notes that, even in challenging economic times, where funding for projects and services is being squeezed across all areas of government, regenerating parks enjoys widespread support, with 57% of adults using their local parks at least once a month or more.\nThe Communities and Local Government Committee, of which I am a member, wants to expand on this with our inquiry into public parks across the UK. We want to hear the views of everyone across the UK about the state of their public parks and how they can be improved. Write to us by Friday 30 September to ensure your voice is heard: contact details are on the Parliament website.\nHaving a say\nThe HLF report also notes that the management of parks will increasingly vary as local authorities seek to make savings through the disposal of land and other assets.\nI am clear that this disposal should not be done to satisfy the commercial interests of larger companies, but instead should involve communities at every stage of the parks management process.\nThe Scottish Government’s Community Empowerment Act gives communities powers to purchase surplus assets and request participation in the management and running of community assets. This means they can have the opportunity to exert greater control over their own neighbourhoods and green spaces.\nWith financial backing of the Scottish Land Fund, which supports bids for community purchase of assets, we can address some of the points made about the diversification of management in a bottom-up, community-led fashion.\nGlasgow Green\nCommunity budgeting can also play a role here and there are many successful pilot projects across Glasgow where communities have been able to decide spending priorities for services in their area, including on the creation and management of parks and green spaces.\nIn my own constituency of Glasgow Central I am delighted to have Glasgow Green, the oldest public park, containing the iconic Doulton Fountain, McLennan Arch, People’s Palace and Winter Garden. The park has benefited from over £8million of HLF support for restoration works, and from community groups who support the park’s heritage and development.\nAlongside HLF support, the Friends of Glasgow Green continue to come up with new and innovative uses for the space. In particular, I want to take this opportunity to congratulate Trisha Ingram, Chair of Friends of Glasgow Green and their members and supporters in taking the first steps to raise funds for an outdoor gym in Glasgow Green, which seeks to replace the original equipment which was donated to the park in 1860.\nThey have already raised £12,000 for the new facility and are hoping to double that amount through a crowdfunding campaign.\nMore generally, Glasgow Green benefits from being part of the MyParkScotland network, which helps people to find out what’s going on in their local park. This was one of Nesta’s HLF-supported 11 Rethinking Parks projects. Through the MyParkScotland network Glasgow Green benefits from the chance to donate securely to individual park projects. I would encourage local authorities and independent park trusts across the UK to adopt this feature when planning and managing the financial resources of green spaces.\nCitizen satisfaction\nIt’s clear from the conclusions of the report that, when local authorities and communities are both invested in protecting and maintaining our green spaces, the payoff in terms of citizen satisfaction with public parks and park quality is significant.\nIt’s also clear that, when parks are prioritised by local authorities, citizens and other stakeholders, cities become better and healthier places to live. If cities across the UK are to retain high quality public parks, then we must give communities the opportunity and autonomy to nurture and protect the green spaces they care about, and I pledge to be an “elected champion” for parks and green spaces in my constituency.\nWhile there is a lot of work to do to ensure that park maintenance and quality remains of a high standard, I am confident that Glasgow will continue to live up to its name of “dear green place” for many years to come.",

Indeed, working families with three children could be up to £2,780 worse off per year under the new rules.\n“In addition, the UK Government is putting women in Northern Ireland in an impossible position given that they, and third party professionals, risk criminalisation if they do not disclose rape to the Police Service of Northern Ireland. Women in Northern Ireland should not be forced to choose between struggling to put food on the table or going through the full process of the criminal justice system.\n“It is welcome that there is such strong agreement from charities and organisations on this issue.

The Prime Minister advanced that the UK Government has taken care to ensure the issue is dealt with sensitively, with Blackford countering that the clause is a disgrace.\nThe rape clause, or non-consensual sex exemption, has been in place for over a year, and forms part of the government’s wider policy to restrict Tax Credits and Universal Credit (child element) claims to the first two children in a family.\nEarlier this week, McVey defended the government’s record on welfare reform during an evidence hearing of the Social Security Committee at Holyrood.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“It really is repugnant to see the Prime Minister leaping to the Secretary of State’s defence on the issue of the rape clause.\n“Earlier this week Esther McVey described this vile policy as “extra help”, “an opportunity to talk” and “double support”. It is none of these things. By supporting it, the Prime Minister and her government are complicit in putting vulnerable women in harm’s way.\n“Experts in violence against women recognise that forced disclosure of abuse brings a significant risk of reliving that trauma. This should always be at a time of a woman’s choosing, not at the point where she has to make a choice about putting food on the table to feed her children.\n“Any defence of the two child limit and rape clause is truly reprehensible. The entire policy is ill-judged, cruel, and has nothing to do with supporting women.

Almost 40% of deaths from portable heaters were of people aged 80 and over during 2013-2014.

Even so, many people in Glasgow have not taken action to ensure their homes are winter-ready.\nDespite the autumn chill, a national survey* shows that more than a third of households (35%) in Scotland have not checked that their central heating is working and nearly four in ten have not prepared their home for winter by getting their boiler serviced. Having an annual boiler service carried out by a Gas Safe registered engineer is crucial as it detects problems with the boiler and controls, including whether it is leaking poisonous carbon monoxide.\nKeeping homes safe is an important part of winter preparation, yet only four in ten households in Scotland have checked that their carbon monoxide alarm is working. Carbon monoxide is known as the ‘silent killer’, because the gas has no odour or taste, and is invisible. Fitting an audible alarm is the second line of defence against carbon monoxide poisoning.\nBeing energy efficient is particularly important during the winter months, and technology can help with this. Whilst more than half of households in Scotland (51%) acknowledge that technology could help their home to run more smoothly during winter, less than a third (32%) have smart meters.\nHaving smart meters installed can help keep household energy in check, as they automatically send readings to the energy supplier. Smart meters also come with a display that shows you how much energy is being used, in pounds and pence, in near real-time, and identify where savings can be made.\nAlison Thewliss MP said: “It’s really important to keep a step ahead of winter. I want everyone in Glasgow to understand what help is available for them, and for their family and friends. Being energy efficient and keeping bills under control is really important, so I’d encourage people to get in touch with their energy supplier to find out what support is on offer.”\nScottish Gas engineer Stephen Cosgrove, who fixes and repairs boilers, said: “Winter can be a challenging time for households, but there are some practical steps that you can take, with our help, to make sure that you are prepared:\nGet the best deal\nWe have been working hard to ensure buying energy is simple, transparent and fair for customers – for every customer on a standard variable tariff they will get an Annual Energy Health Check to make sure they’re on the right tariff. This will highlight other ways we can help our customers save money like replacing old and inefficient boilers or insulating their homes for free.\nGet smart meters\nYour energy supplier will be able to install smart meters, which mean an end to estimated bills. A smart energy monitor shows how much energy you are using, and what you are spending. Scottish Gas customers are provided with online tools to help them manage their energy usage. Find out more by visiting www.britishgas.co.uk/smartmeters\nThe Scottish Gas Energy Trust\nThis independent trust gives face-to-face advice, financial support and grants to help clear energy and household debts.

To do this, turn the system off and when cool turn the radiator key until the air stops and water runs consistently. Once you have turned the system back on, the problem should be solved.\nb. Cold spots in the bottom or centre of the radiator may be an indication of sludge build up and the need for system flushing.\nc. Bleeding your radiator may result in pressure dropping. If you have a pressure gauge, make sure the boiler is at the right pressure and top up as necessary.\nBlock the breeze: Make sure all of your windows and doors seal properly to stop warm air escaping. For those that don’t, fitting draught excluders, which you can buy from most DIY stores, is a quick and cheap way to cut down on your energy bills.\nStay safe: It’s vital to have a carbon monoxide alarm fitted and that you test it regularly.\nLove your boiler: Check to make sure that your boiler is working properly before winter sets in. The older your boiler, the more inefficient it will be. If you have a pressure gauge, make sure the boiler is at the right pressure and top up as necessary.\nInsulate your pipes: Burst pipes are a huge issue during winter months. To help prevent burst pipes, ensure all pipes are properly insulated by using lagging, which can be bought cheaply from most DIY shops.\nMaintain your drains: If you’re trying to keep your drains outside well maintained, it’s a good idea to make sure they are clear of debris at the point at which they enter the ground. This involves checking your gullies for autumnal leaves and twigs in order to ensure that they don’t restrict water flow at any point.\nControl your heating remotely with Hive Active Heating: Using Hive Active Heating means you can control your heating and hot water remotely from your smartphone with the Hive app, so you can ensure your home is warm when you need it to be.

As a result, many have been sent correspondence stating that the Home Office believe them to be of questionable character and that they represent a threat to national security.\nDuring the exchange, Thewliss urged Ministers to take this matter up with their colleagues in the Home Office.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“The Treasury have confirmed to me today that it is entirely reasonable and sensible for people to make legitimate corrections and amendments to their tax returns. Yet, in the case of skilled migrants, these are the very actions being interpreted by the Home Office as somehow unacceptable.\n“From the Minister’s response today, it’s manifestly clear that there is a lack of joined up thinking across government. Many of the individuals affected by this merciless policy are working in highly skilled occupations, and have put down roots in this country and contributed greatly both to their communities and to the economy.\n“The UK Government should be doing its utmost to make the UK an attractive place for these people to stay, instead it is actively presiding over a hostile environment policy which is ruining people’s lives.\n“I urge the Treasury to bring what pressure it can to bear on the Home Office, to make clear that legitimately correcting a tax return should not later lead to a threat of removal from the UK”.",

This approach recognises that addiction is primarily a health issue and should be treated as such, rather than as a criminal matter.\n“Decades of evidence and international experiences have shown that punitive approaches to drug use have not been successful in reducing drug-related harms. Instead, they have perpetuated a cycle of criminalisation, stigmatisation, and marginalisation, leading to devastating consequences for individuals and communities.\n“By decriminalising drug use, we can shift the focus towards harm reduction, rehabilitation, and support services. This approach will enable individuals struggling with drug addiction to seek the help they need without fear of criminal repercussions. It opens up the possibility of treating addiction as a public health issue, offering individuals a chance to recover and reintegrate into society.\n“I commend the Scottish Government for their progressive stance and for prioritising the health and well-being of individuals affected by drug addiction. For too long, my constituents have been suffering at the hands of these restrictive policies for drug users. It is high time that this UK Tory Government take action to support people all across these Isles through a renewed approach to drug use.”",

A life threatening and relatively unknown condition, which claims the lives of 44,000 people – including 1,000 children – every year in the UK. The event, hosted by the APPG on Sepsis and the UK Sepsis Trust, was attend by over 40 MPs and Peers, along with a number of patients and their families who have been personally affected by sepsis.\nSepsis is a life-threatening condition that can affect anyone. It arises when the body’s response to an infection damages its own tissues and organs. It can lead to shock, multiple organ failure, and death, especially if it is not recognised early and treated promptly.\nIn a bid to reduce deaths like these, the UK Sepsis Trust (UKST) and the APPG on Sepsis are calling for both the public and healthcare professionals to be more aware of this ‘silent killer’. They are calling for the Department of Health to commit to a public awareness campaign, aimed at both adults and children solely on sepsis.\nThe UK Sepsis Trust, founded in 2010, brings together leading experts, grass roots health professionals, survivors and persons bereaved; to raise public and professional awareness of sepsis, and provide support for those affected by this terrible condition.\nDr Ron Daniels, Chief Executive of the UK Sepsis Trust, said:\n“We hope that the event will allow MPs to learn more about sepsis and take the message back to their colleagues and constituents.”\n“An awareness campaign is something we’ve been calling for a long time. It is an absolute necessity that this campaign is dedicated on sepsis and aimed at a both adults and children. A campaign of course is only a part of what is needed. We need to make sure that healthcare professional education is robust and is mandated. We need to have a better measure of outcomes and we have to have some resources available that reward excellent care.”\nAlison Thewliss MP stated:\n“While sepsis is a condition which may not hit the headlines, it is deadly. It is a little known life threatening illness that claims the lives of 44,000 people in the UK every year, including 1,000 children. If timely interventions proposed by the UK Sepsis Trust were adopted across the NHS it could save up to 12,500 lives a year and the NHS money.”\n“I was keen to show my support for efforts to tackle the disease and save lives. I want to see sepsis viewed as a medical emergency and have a higher profile among medical professionals and the public. The easiest and most of effective way of doing this is the government committing to a dedicated public awareness campaign for the general population.”",

They also facilitate more informal groups on gardening, music, creative writing and cookery.\nMs Thewliss had a chance to meet with some of the refugees who use the service and hear their experiences of interacting with the Home Office.\nSpeaking after her visit to the Adelphi Centre, where the project is based, Ms Thewliss said:\n“I was really grateful for the opportunity to visit Freedom from Torture this morning. The work they do to support some of the most vulnerable asylum seekers in our country is heart-warming and ensures refugees get the love and support they need after such awful ordeals.\n“The opportunity to listen to the experiences and testimony of the refugees was incredibly moving – particularly regarding some of the ill-treatment at the hands of the UK Home Office. I cannot help but conclude that traumatic situations are exacerbated by an uncaring and cold hearted Home Office, which is clearly ill equipped to deal with survivors of torture. It is so important that survivors of torture have their cases heard properly, particularly when Freedom from Torture have provided expert medico-legal evidence to support their claim. I’ll certainly be taking this up with the Home Office to ensure survivors of torture are treated with more respect, sensitivity and dignity.”",

The BHF estimates that 10,000 people die every year as rates of bystander CPR are very low.\nEvery minute without CPR or defibrillation can reduce a person’s chance of surviving a cardiac arrest by around ten per cent.\nAlison Thewliss, MP for Glasgow Central, said:\n“It is worrying to hear the number of lives being lost because rates of bystander CPR in the UK are too low. Every second counts, and CPR really is the difference between life and death.”\n“All young people should have the skills to save a life. I’m supporting first aid skills on the school curriculum as a vital part of the PSHE curriculum.”\nSimon Gillespie, Chief Executive of the British Heart Foundation, said:\n“It’s great to have the support of Alison Thewliss MP in incorporating this life saving skill into the secondary school curriculum. The chance of surviving is almost zero if people collapse and receive no bystander CPR until the emergency services arrive.\n“There is clearly a huge benefit to the public knowing life saving CPR skills, evidenced by the vastly better survival rates from cardiac arrests in countries where CPR is part of the curriculum. Thousands of deaths could be prevented if more people learn CPR.\nI encourage all secondary schools in Glasgow Central to apply for the BHF’s free training kits.”\nMel Fox, Director of Training at St John Ambulance, said:\n“Now’s the time for first aid education to be available to all our young people. Learning CPR and other life saving skills should be part of their passage into adulthood and with many free resources available for schools like our Big First Aid Lesson on 3rd November, there is plenty of opportunity for children to become life savers.”\nJoe Mulligan, head of first aid education at The British Red Cross said:\n“We want all young people to feel confident and willing to help when faced with a first aid emergency. Learning first aid helps to increase confidence levels and we believe it’s a life skill everyone should have.\n“Ultimately the British Red Cross would like everyone to have the opportunity to learn first aid throughout their lives, starting at school, so that a generation of people can be equipped with the skills they need to help in an emergency.\n“Our free teaching resources and workshops are designed to give young people the skills, confidence and willingness to act in an emergency.”",
  "http_www_alisonthewliss_scot/http_www_alisonthewliss_scot_glasgow-snp-budget-statement/content_393.html": "Glasgow’s team of SNP MPs have today (Wednesday 16th March) railed against Chancellor George Osborne’s budget, which they say will “condemn the city to a decade of austerity”.\nTeam Glasgow highlighted a number of cruel policy announcements in Osborne’s budget which will have a detrimental impact on Glaswegians.\nGlasgow Central MP, Alison Thewliss, said:\n“This is a bad budget for Glasgow and reminds us that nothing and no-one is safe from the Tory axe. The SNP advocates a more balanced approach to the budget which would return the UK’s finances to a sustainable path whilst, crucially, still investing in public services. Today’s Tory cuts will only heap further unnecessary pressure on the public sector. The Chancellor has confirmed a decade of austerity. It is austerity through choice, not necessity.”\nGlasgow North West MP, Carol Monaghan – a Physics Teacher at Hyndland Secondary School before becoming an MP – warned that the Chancellor’s budget is devastating for Glasgow’s young people. She said:\n“In his 2015 Summer Budget, the Chancellor announced he would be slashing student maintenance grants for some of the poorest students, and converting them into loans. Today the Chancellor also scrapped automatic entitlement to housing benefit for unemployed 18-21 year olds, which the homeless charity Crisis condemned and said would result in an increase in homelessness.”\nChris Stephens, MP for Glasgow South West, said:\n“The Tories have already cut Scotland’s budget by £2.4 billion and plan to make a further £1.3 billion of cuts by 2019/20. Welfare cuts in particular mean that 100,000 additional Scottish children will move into relative poverty by 2020. In announcing today’s budget, the Chancellor has just condemned this city and the rest of Scotland to a decade of austerity.”\nStewart McDonald, MP for Glasgow South, said:\n“This harsh Tory budget means that the Scottish Government will see a real terms reduction of £1.5 billion in the funding for day to day public services over the next four years – that is bad news for public sector workers in Glasgow”.\nGlasgow North East MP, Anne McLaughlin, said:\n“The Chancellor is cutting benefits for the disabled, the sick and the vulnerable to fund a tax cut for high earners. Just last week, the DWP announced major changes to Personal Independence Payments. It is estimated that these changes will adversely impact 640,000 people, a large number of whom are Glaswegians. However, we know from today’s budget that this has allowed the Chancellor to give a tax cut to top earners and pull hundreds of thousands of people out of the higher rate of income tax.\n“Put simply, the Chancellor is taking from the disabled to give to his pals in the city of London. The only people who are “better together” are the Chancellor’s cronies because it certainly doesn’t feel like we’re better together for my constituents.”\nPatrick Grady, SNP MP, for Glasgow North, concluded by saying the only way to firmly reject Tory austerity was to send a clear message at May’s Holyrood election by using both votes for the SNP. He said: “Today’s Tory budget reminds us why – now more than ever – we need a strong SNP Scottish Government to stand up to Westminster.\n“The best way to send a clear message to the Tories that we won’t take another decade of austerity is to vote SNP. Whether you live in Summerston, Shettleston or Shawlands, it’s got to be both votes SNP in May.”",

This problem has persisted throughout the cost of energy crisis and UK Government support has not successfully addressed this matter, repeatedly failing the residents of Riverside Dalmarnock.\n“To that effect, I would be interested in hearing from you as to what steps the UK Government is taking to tackle this problem, in light of its commitment to shield all households from spiralling energy costs, and what particular support it may offer to my constituents on communal heat networks. I would be happy to meet with you to discuss this subject in greater detail if that were of any interest.”\nIn their response, the Department for Net Zero and Energy Security said:\n“The Energy Act 2023 has now passed into law and will provide us with powers to regulate the heat networks sector and appoint Ofgem as regulator. The Act gives ministers powers to introduce consumer protection rules and carbon emissions limits on heat networks.\n“The legislation will give Ofgem powers to investigate and intervene on networks where prices for consumers appear to be unfair, or if prices are significantly higher than comparable heating systems. Our ambition is that consumer protections will start to be regulated from Spring 2025 with price regulation beginning Spring 2026.”\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“It is completely unacceptable that my constituents need to wait until Spring of 2026 before any action is taken to halt the soaring cost of energy bills. A number of constituents in Dalmarnock served by an unregulated communal heat network have been in touch, experiencing severe financial worry, yet it seems that the UK Government and the powerless energy regulator Ofgem are just standing back and letting it happen.\n“I asked the Prime Minister today whether it was the Government’s incompetency or Ofgem’s lack of powers that have caused these rising bills. His inability to provide an answer highlights the blatant disregard the UK Government has shown to these vulnerable constituents.\n“In energy-rich Scotland, nobody should be forced to choose between heating their own home or putting food on the table. We must have full control over energy to ensure our people are not left in the cold this winter.”",

Alison used 3.6 pence worth of energy to make her 3 pancakes.\nAvailable at no extra cost from your energy supplier, a smart meter will show you exactly how much you are spending on energy in near real time, helping you to manage your energy at home, reduce waste and bring bills down.\nAlison Thewliss MP said:\n“Taking on the Westminster Pancake Challenge was great fun and helped me with my preparations for Pancake Day! It also demonstrated how much energy can be consumed when preparing food and how costs of using energy can mount up very quickly.\n“Many constituents will find that smart meters can help with budgeting and bringing down energy bills and they should be offered the option of a smart meter by their energy provider. I and my staff are also on hand to provide advice to reduce energy bills – get in touch and we would be more than happy to offer energy saving tips and direct constituents to organisations that can help with the cost of living.”\nGreat British Bake-Off star Ian Cumming said:\n“Pancakes can be tricky to flip at the best of times, but the politicians did an excellent job with nothing dropped on the floor or stuck to the ceiling.\n“During the challenge, I kept an eye on how much energy Alison Thewliss MP was using, with the help of a smart meter in-home display. Being able to see the cost of the energy you use when you’re cooking, is key to bringing bills down.\n“With so many gadgets, hobs and ovens, the kitchen can be a real draw on energy, but I think everyone was impressed by how a smart meter can help you save in the kitchen”\nRobert Cheesewright, Director of Policy and Communications at Smart Energy GB said:\n“The pancake challenge was great fun and I’m really pleased that so many MPs from across the country have come together to demonstrate how smart meters can help households reduce their energy bills.”",

The government cannot sit on its hands, as the UK heads for the biggest increase in inequality since the Thatcher years.”",

The new Glasgow Central MP will lead an adjournment debate on the subject of breast feeding to coincide with World Breastfeeding Week 2015.\nMs Thewliss was successful in this week’s ballot of MPs to apply for debate time in the UK Parliament. An adjournment debate allows MPs to debate a motion without a vote being put and usually lasts for up to an hour. A UK Minister is also required to respond to the MPs on behalf of the Government.\nSpeaking in advance of next week’s Westminster Hall debate, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“I’ve been a great supporter of breastfeeding since having my son five years ago. I know how difficult it can be, and wanted to take this opportunity both to highlight the benefits of breastfeeding and what role wider society can play in raising awareness.\n“Evidence tells us that breastfed infants are likely to have a reduced risk of infection, particularly those affecting the ear, respiratory tract and gastro-intestinal tract. This protective effect is particularly marked in low birth weight infants.\n“Other probable benefits include improved cognitive and psychological development, and a reduced risk of childhood obesity. There is also evidence that women who breastfed have lower risks of breast cancer, epithelial ovarian cancer and hip fracture later in life.\n“I am looking forward to next week’s debate which I hope to be constructive and will allow me to push this important issue further up the agenda.”",

Now the MP is asking interested parties to submit thoughts and proposals for consideration before 9am on Monday 9th January 2017. After that she will move to drafting the Bill, which will be published early in the new year.\nThe Bill seeks to make provision for the control of advertising and promotion of feeding products for babies and children. The MP intends for the Bill to establish a body – completely independent of industry – which would regularly safety test formula milks and other infant feeding products, and potentially adjudicate on the veracity of claims made by companies as to the ingredients and nutritional value of such products. The Bill aims also to include provision for stiffer financial penalties for formula companies which publish scientifically inaccurate and misleading claims.\nThose interested in responding to the consultation are asked to fill out a short consultation form.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“I have been overwhelmed by the support and good wishes of so many people who have a wealth of knowledge around infant feeding. I would encourage as many people as possible to visit my website, fill out the consultation form, and let me know their thoughts as to what might potentially be helpful to include in the Bill.\n“Taking a Ten Minute Rule Bill all the way through to being put on the statute books is a tall order, so I am keen to give the Bill the best possible chance of success. I am conscious that if the Bill is drafted sensibly and pragmatic enough, then there’s every chance that the Government might consider adopting it.”",

There are approximately 500 people actively injecting drugs in Glasgow city centre, and recent reports describe the unprecedented HIV outbreak in the city as out of control. What’s more, I am greatly concerned for the safety of my constituents as a result of needles left in bin sheds, closes and back lanes.\n“Recent debates in the Scottish Parliament and Glasgow City Council have demonstrated a clear desire for the introduction of a safe drug consumption facility, with support from all parties, including members of the Conservative Party. My Bill will take new steps to enable drug addiction to be treated as a public health issue, whilst ensuring that criminal activity from illegal drugs continues to be robustly tackled by the police.\n“People are dying on the streets of my constituency, and the risk to the general public from discarded needles and transmission of blood-borne diseases is very real. The only remaining barrier to doing something different is the Home Office’s unwillingness to grant an exemption.\n“Perhaps if the Home Secretary visited my constituency, and witnessed the perilousness of the situation for her herself, she could be more easily persuaded.

Ms Thewliss will host a public meeting, where she will be joined by residents, local MPs and breastfeeding support groups.\nThe peer support service paired new mums with mums who had experience with breastfeeding their babies. The service covered the first few weeks and months of the baby’s life, with scheduled visits before, and up to 6 weeks after, the baby is born. As well as providing reliable and informative advice to new mums, regular visits to the new mums by peer support volunteers helped the new mums to monitor babies’ progress and identify any problems that may arise at an early stage.\nThe closure of the Star Buddies peer support service has been met with serious concern by campaigners and health professionals in the NHS. Figures released by Public Health England reveal that Blackpool has below average breastfeeding rates, with 61.6% of mothers initiating breastfeeding within 48 hours of their babies being born, compared with 74.3% for England as a whole.\nCommenting prior to her visit, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“The closure of peer support services for breastfeeding in Blackpool has left many people understandably concerned about the quality and level of support available for new mums who are taking their first steps into parenthood.\n“Mums need access to reliable sources of information in order to make the best decisions for feeding their babies and understanding what works for them for feeding their babies. Drawing on the knowledge of mums who have breastfed their babies within the first few weeks of a baby’s life provides valuable guidance and support at what can be a daunting and stressful period for new mums.\n“The APPG has heard evidence of the positive impact that peer support services like Star Buddies can have on the lives of new mums. I am keen to recognise the efforts of those volunteers who have dedicated their time to run the service in Blackpool and challenge the decision of the Council to close an effective, integrated service which made an important contribution to improving breastfeeding rates.”",

Thewliss has called this move a ‘tactic in the ongoing pay dispute with postal workers’ and has accused Royal Mail of ‘acting in bad faith’.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“Postal workers across Glasgow Central are struggling to make ends meet in the face of the cost-of-living crisis while Royal Mail shareholders benefited from bumper profits in the millions.\n“It is understandable that postal workers find the argument that there isn’t money for them to have a fair wage unpalatable when there are millions of pounds of profit for shareholders, who should share the burden – when hard working postal staff are struggling to put food on their table this winter.\n“Royal Mail staff in Glasgow Central and their families need financial security. The decision to strike will not have been easy for any of them, but this is about more than pay; it is also about protecting the universal mail service we all expect and value.\n“Royal Mail need to get back to the negotiating table – in a meaningful way – and put our communities at the heart of discussions.”",

In Northern Ireland, third party referrers are obliged under law to report instances of rape, even if doing so means that women are placed in further danger of violence.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“This is as good a time as any for the UK Government to drop the vile and medieval rape clause, and stigmatising two child policy which lies behind it.\n“Esther McVey is now the fifth Secretary of State for the DWP since I was elected in 2015, and the first woman in that time. I want to know from her whether she is comfortable in making a woman who has suffered the trauma of rape, domestic violence and coercive control go through the shame of proving her child was conceived as a result of that sexual abuse.\n“Similarly, I am keen to understand Karen Bradley’s views on the ongoing legal uncertainty in Northern Ireland with respect to this policy. The current system places third party referrers in an impossible position and arguably puts women off claiming an exemption at all. If cases are referred to the police, this potentially places women who are already vulnerable in even more danger at the hands of their abusive partners.\n“So far, the UK Government has failed to listen on this issue. I am hopeful that the Prime Minister’s reshuffle presents an opportunity for the right thing to be done by women and families, and for this abhorrent policy to be rescinded once and for all”.",

The move is expected to take effect from June 2018. People in the other postcode areas served by Victoria Road delivery office will be unaffected.\nWhilst Royal Mail have stated that the changes will not affect deliveries made to customers, those picking up letters and parcels which were unable to be delivered will have to travel around 2.5 miles over the Clyde and across the city centre to retrieve items.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“I am hugely disappointed at this decision by Royal Mail, which will cause a massive amount of inconvenience for residents in the G5 postcode area of my constituency.\n“I first became aware that Royal Mail were considering this move at the tail end of last year, and wrote to every resident in the G5 area to gauge opinion about the proposals. Unsurprisingly, the weight of objection was staggering, with over 96% of respondents stating they were against it.\n“More worrying still was the comments made by several residents who are infirm, or unable to travel. Many explained to me in their responses that they would simply be unable to make a trip to Baird Street, be it due to ill-health or for financial reasons. Whilst I welcome the promise of extended opening hours, and I appreciate that Royal Mail say they can arrange for items to be redelivered, this will not always be suitable. These measures cannot adequately replace the convenience of a local, accessible delivery office.\n“The fact that Royal Mail, in spite of the evidence presented, have pressed ahead with this plan is frankly appalling, and strikes a further blow against consumers whose essential, local services are slowly being eroded”.",

Every year over 41,000 people (one every 15 minutes) are diagnosed with bowel cancer and 16,200 people die of the disease.\nBowel cancer screening can save lives but at the moment in some areas of the UK only a third of those who receive a test complete it. Thousands of people are missing out on the chance to detect bowel cancer early when it is easier to treat.\nAlison Thewliss MP said:\n“As the MP for Glasgow Central, I am committed to improving uptake rates for bowel cancer screening, both locally and nationally.”\n“I would urge my constituents who are sent a bowel screening test to use it. Taking part in bowel cancer screening is the best way to get diagnosed early. If you are over 50, take the test when you receive it in the post. If you are younger, tell the people over 50 in your life to take the test. Early diagnosis really can save lives.”\nDeborah Alsina, Chief Executive of Bowel Cancer UK, said,\n“I’d like to thank Alison Thewliss for supporting our campaign during Bowel Cancer Awareness Month to raise participation levels for bowel cancer screening. One in 14 men and one in 19 women will be diagnosed with bowel cancer during their lifetime but it is treatable and curable, especially if diagnosed early.”\nThe Scottish Bowel Screening Programme can detect bowel cancer at an early stage in people with no symptoms when it is easier to treat. Since its launch, it has been proven to save lives. If you’re registered with a GP and aged 50-74, you will receive a test in the post every two years. You carry out the simple test at home in private and it comes with step by step instructions. The test looks for hidden blood in your poo, which could be an early sign of bowel cancer.\nVisit Bowel Cancer UK’s website to find out how you can get involved in their campaign for Bowel Cancer Awareness Month.",

That they wanted this callous policy to be buried speaks volumes in itself.\n“Women across the world have been marching this weekend in solidarity with America, whilst here in the UK, the Westminster Government ploughs ahead to undermine women’s rights.\n“Obviously I am pleased that the UK Government has made a number of concessions, which will go some way to reducing some of the cruellest aspects associated with this pernicious proposal.\n“I particularly welcome the u-turn on multiple births and that there will be no time limit on the reporting of rape. What is also encouraging is the decision to remove frontline DWP and HMRC staff from gatekeeping on this incredibly sensitive process. However, there are still fundamental problems with this pernicious two-child policy, not least concerning those of faith and ethnic minority backgrounds.\n“The UK Government’s own response clearly identifies that the most controversial aspect of the policy was the rape clause. Ministers even go on to concede that most respondents felt it was unacceptable for the UK Government to ask women to re-live the ordeal of a rape just in order to make a claim for benefit. Despite receiving that loud and overwhelming message, this appalling and crass Tory Government refuse to listen.\n“The fact remains that this policy, however diluted, is still anti-women, anti-family and fundamentally wicked.\n“There are still a number of very serious unanswered questions about the practicalities of a policy due to be implemented in just a few months’ time.

This is a real inspiration to many young people.\n“It’s also great to see the Scottish Government doing its bit to support basketball at a grassroots level. The CashBack for communities programme recently awarded £492,800 to Basketball Scotland, allowing them to deliver 16 basketball school projects over a three-year period in some of the most deprived areas of Scotland. This speaks to the broad appeal that the sport is continuing to develop – something that I’m desperate to see continue.\n“Like many others, I’ve been extremely concerned by recent reports that basketball in the UK is facing a funding shortfall of almost £1m. With the Commonwealth Games due to start in only a matter of weeks, it’s crucial that the UK Government do the right thing to secure not only the future funding for the sport, but the places of the Scottish and England teams who have done so well to qualify”.",
  "http_www_alisonthewliss_scot/https_www_alisonthewliss_scot_budget-missed-opportunity-to-scrap-rape-clause/content_113.html": "Alison Thewliss, SNP MP for Glasgow Central, has expressed her “sheer desolation” following the Chancellor’s budget statement today (Wednesday). Despite making his budget statement to Parliament on International Women’s Day, Phillip Hammond MP did not use the budget as an opportunity to scrap the Government’s controversial rape clause and two child policy. The Glasgow MP said today’s “missed opportunity” was an insult to women all across the UK who were celebrating International Women’s Day.\nIn the George Osborne’s budget of July 2015 – and buried within the small print – the UK Government announced plans to restrict tax credit payments to two children per family and force women to provide evidence of exceptional circumstances, such as rape, to claim tax credits for a third child from April 2017.\nCommenting from Westminster after the Chancellor delivered his budget speech to Parliament, Ms Thewliss said:\n“Today’s budget was a real missed opportunity for Phillip Hammond and Theresa May to do the honourable thing and scrap the UK Government’s pernicious two child policy and medieval rape clause.\n“I cannot begin to describe the sheer desolation I felt when I looked at the UK Government’s Red Book today of all days – International Women’s Day – and saw that this callous Chancellor is still intending to make women prove they’ve been raped in order to receive tax credits.\n“I’ve spent over a year and a half campaigning against this appalling policy, and I still cannot believe that any Government would think it’s acceptable to put women and their families through such incredible pain and misery.\n“Although they’ve not yet laid the necessary statutory instrument before Parliament, it’s looking increasingly likely that the UK Government is planning to implement the rape clause on the April 6th. I urge the Tories, even at this late stage, to reconsider their cruel, anti-women policy.”",

The event, which takes place during October’s Breast Cancer Awareness Month, is in its 16th year and has raised over £30 million to date for Breast Cancer Now’s life-saving research.\nMs Thewliss joined fellow parliamentarians in Westminster earlier this month to show her support for the thousands of women and men affected by breast cancer each year, encouraging people across the UK to take part on wear it pink day.\nAnyone can take part in wear it pink, which brings together schools, workplaces and communities. All you need to do is wear something pink, or hold a pink event at home, work or school, and make a donation to Breast Cancer Now. Whatever you do, you’re helping the charity achieve its aim that, if we all act now, by 2050 everyone who develops breast cancer will live.\nCommenting on the campaign, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“Breast cancer is the most common cancer in the UK. One in eight women will face it in their lifetime, and every year around 11,500 women and 80 men lose their lives to the disease. This is why I’m urging everyone in Glasgow Central to take part in wear it pink on Friday 20 October. It’s such a fun and easy way to support Breast Cancer Now’s vital research, and help stop breast cancer taking the lives of those we love.\nAlso in attendance was Sky News presenter and former Olympic gymnast Jacquie Beltrao. Jacquie, who was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2013, is lending her support to wear it pink in the hope that thousands of people across the country will take part in the event.\nJacquie Beltrao said:\n“I’m very proud to support wear it pink; it’s a great excuse to dress up in pink and have some fun while raising money for a really important cause. I have had breast cancer myself and following my diagnosis and treatment have become incredibly passionate about raising awareness and funds for research.\n“Wear it pink has raised over £30 million to date for Breast Cancer Now, which is incredible. The event raises funds for the charity’s world-class research, which will hopefully one day put a stop to this dreadful disease. That is why I’m asking people across the country join me, and the MPs who took part in Westminster, by adding a splash of pink to their outfits on wear it pink day and donating to Breast Cancer Now. I hope lots of people across the UK take part!”\nTo take part in wear it pink this October, please visit Wear it Pink for further details, fundraising ideas and how to register for your free fundraising pack.",

I hope the UK Government will adopt similarly proportionate and sensible measures to protect animal welfare across the UK.\nThe charity’s Advocacy Manager Jacqui Cuff said:\n“Cats are one of the nation’s favourite pets so it was wonderful to welcome so many politicians to discuss how we can improve feline welfare in the UK.\n“Sadly, despite their popularity, we see huge numbers of cats and kittens coming into our care every year. Cats Protection works tirelessly to tackle the root of the problem, by promoting neutering and offering advice and information on responsible cat ownership.\n“This year we have also launched our True Cost of Kittens campaign to highlight a growing kitten breeding industry which frequently puts profit before welfare. As part of this campaign, we’ve been calling for a change in the law to better protect kittens and cats from poor breeding practices that frequently lead to serious health issues.\n“Throughout the year, we have been asking MPs for their help in pushing forward these changes which will greatly improve the welfare of cats in the UK. So this Christmas, we thought we’d ask them to get involved in one of the more creative and fun areas of our work – coming up with names for the cats in our care.\n“There’s been some lovely suggestions and we’ll be choosing our seven favourites – one for every day of the week – which will be used for cats that come into our care during the New Year.”",
  "http_www_alisonthewliss_scot/https_www_alisonthewliss_scot_category_breastfeeding/content_63.html": "Alison Thewliss, MP for Glasgow Central, and chair of the APPG on Infant Feeding and Inequalities, has commended the results of a recent Scottish Government survey into breastfeeding rates and infant nutrition.\nThe Scottish Maternal and Infant Nutrition Survey was conducted in the first half of 2017 and invited responses from hundreds of women, including expectant mothers, those whose babies were between 8-12 weeks old, and those whose babies were 8-12 months old. The questionnaire focussed on maternal nutrition, breastfeeding, infant feeding and related health behaviours.\nThe survey pointed to progress being made in many areas, with 43% of mothers now continuing to breastfeed up to six months after birth, compared with 32% in 2010. In addition, it spoke to an increase in the overall duration of breastfeeding.\nCommenting, Alison Thewliss MP said:\n“It is greatly encouraging to see an uplift in the number of mothers who are breastfeeding for longer, and I am delighted that this increase is a significant one. It’s important to recognise the work going on in hospitals and local areas by both health professionals and volunteer peer supporters, as this couldn’t be achieved without their incredible efforts.\n“The Unicef UK Baby Friendly Initiative standards recommend that, in order to maximise health outcomes for children, breastfeeding should be promoted exclusively for the first six months. In that sense, it’s terrific to see so many women in Scotland maximising breastmilk and introducing solid foods later.\n“I know there is still a lot of work to be done in this area. Whilst help and information is given to mothers to promote and assist with breastfeeding, the survey results show the main reasons for breastfeeding ceasing early is due to concerns around feeding problems, and also finding feeding too difficult. It’s therefore crucial that health professionals continue to provide and develop ongoing support.\n“Studies such as this are fundamental, as they provide an evidence base on which more informed policy decisions can be made, in this case to help design and implement better advice and support for families. It’s crucial that the UK Government do the same, in order to improve health outcomes across the country”.",

Today we got more heat than light from the Government.\n“Despite spending a significant proportion of my speech laying out concerns about the principle and operation of the two child policy and the rape clause, the Minister made no attempt whatsoever to address these issues.\n“The Minister failed to take on board well founded and legitimate concerns about the Government’s third party reporting mechanism, and couldn’t give any guarantees how this would work. That is shocking when you consider the policy was announced over 400 days ago.\n“The other red herring today was this same tired line that the Government will be consulting with stakeholders, but this has been incredibly limited in scope so far. Charities such as Stepchange Debt Charity, Child Poverty Action Group and Scottish Women’s Aid have all criticised the policy.\n“In light of the fact that the Government is clearly unwilling to meaningfully engage – and do so publicly – on this deeply worrying policy, I will now be pushing ahead to organise a major event at Westminster which will bring together women’s welfare groups, rape crisis charities, faith communities and welfare charities. I will, of course, be inviting the Minister to address the event and listen to the very genuine concerns which still exist and could have been resolved today”.",
