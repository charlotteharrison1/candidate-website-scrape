This is despite the NHS recommending that under-18s see a dentist at least once a year because their teeth can decay faster, compared to two years for adults. Tooth decay is also the leading cause of hospital admissions for children aged 6–10.\nThe Liberal Democrats are calling for an emergency rescue plan for NHS dentistry, including spending any funding that has gone unspent in recent years to boost the number of appointments as well as the removal of VAT on children’s toothbrushes and toothpaste.\nLisa Smart, the MP for Hazel Grove, said: “I wrote to the former Conservative Health Secretary late last year when the final dentist in Romiley stopped seeing NHS patients. While Labour made all the right noises ahead of forming the new Government, we have yet to see any action.\n“Imagine just not being able to find a dentist for your child, and knowing that this could impact them for the rest of their lives? For far too many people in our area, that’s just a reality.\nTom Morrison, MP for Cheadle, added: “The Conservative party’s disastrous legacy on the NHS cannot be understated. The new Government must make fixing dentistry here a top priority after the Conservatives ran them into the ground.\"\n“The only way we will rescue dentistry in our area is by the Government investing in local health services at the Budget and bringing an end to dental deserts so that every child across Stockport can see a dentist when they need to.”",

The new rules published just before Christmas make it clear that we no longer need to include Green Belt sites and our decision to pause has saved council tax payers some £200,000 in what would have been a worthless consultation.\n“The council has already sought legal advice over the best way to proceed and work continues to ensure the policies drafted under the old rules are compliant with the new ones. Briefings have already happened for Group Leaders, a Local Development Scheme has been published allowing for consultation to commence as soon as possible without compromising the pre-election period, and a formal working meeting is happening today to take the necessary next steps.\n“Our Local Development Scheme sets out the precise timings for delivery of an ambitious Local Plan that will deliver housing across the borough. In the meantime we continue to deliver new housing of mixed tenure, with significant developments well underway including 4,000 new homes within the Mayoral Development Corporation area and beyond.\n“Labour in Stockport seem hell-bent on concreting over the Green Belt, putting more profitable plots of land in the hands of developers and thereby stalling any efforts to redevelop our urban core and other, previously developed sites. We will not allow this to happen on our watch.”\nSaving our green spaces is vital\nWe believe in preserving our green spaces – that means building the right houses in the right places (and the schools and hospitals to go with them).

The recent period under Tory rule has seen all public services run into the ground, with wild and unfunded spending commitments made with no plan of how to actually deliver them.\n“We welcome the more grown up approach Rachel Reeves has brought and I join our party leader, Ed Davey, in congratulating her on being the first female Chancellor of the Exchequer and the first woman to deliver the government’s budget. Make no mistake, however – the huge mess left by the previous Tory governments is clearly going to take years to fix. Local government cannot wait years and we look to the Spending Review planned for next Spring to rebalance our funding and enable us to continue to deliver the local services that residents value so much.\n“Whilst it is very welcome, the additional funding for social care is a drop in the ocean and investment in Special Educational Needs and Disabilities will certainly help. But these are the areas that are crippling council budgets up and down the country and longer term, sustainable funding solutions need to be found.”\nCllr Jilly Julian, Cabinet Member for Finance and Resources and who will deliver the Council’s budget next February, added: “Whilst we are told we will only get a one year settlement this year, we welcome the promise of multi-year settlements following the Spending Review. This will help us to plan service delivery and even to achieve cost savings in some areas.\n“The extension to the Household Support Fund and Discretionary Housing Payments are most welcome. These will help us to continue to support our most vulnerable residents in a period where they are still experiencing a cost of living crisis. The additional funding for other services really isn’t enough but it is clearly better than the further cuts we had feared and it will all help.\n“To make meaningful impact on Stockport Council’s budget position in the next few years we need significant reform to statutory service provision, adequate funding to deliver local services and a growing, multi-year settlement that enables us to plan and improve. The alternative for all councils is managed decline and the threat of insolvency hanging over them.”",

This is due to the robustness of our approach and the way all councillors work together on the council’s budget to deliver the best outcomes for the whole of Stockport.\n“Some 70% of the council’s budget is now devoted to demand-led services, such as adult and children’s social care. We await the government’s long-promised solution to funding social care and we agree wholeheartedly with the Local Government Association that far more funds need to be provided to help us cope with rising costs and demand. In the absence of that extra money, we will do what is needed to deliver a balanced budget and ensure our continued financial robustness.”",

Lisa should be proud of leading the fight back for local people in tackling this environmental crime.”\nLiberal Democrat Candidate for Hazel Grove, Lisa Smart said: “This is a national crisis, and the Conservative Government is looking the other way.

It means that the major infrastructure project that was meant to connect Northern communities and close the North-South divide will not go ahead, whilst also ending any possibility for the much-needed Northern Powerhouse Rail.\nThe Conservative Party’s commitment to their ‘Levelling Up’ agenda has come under fire as Northern communities will once again be subjected to worse transport links than the South.

Regional and local railway lines are also expected to suffer.\nLiberal Democrat candidate for the Cheadle constituency, Tom Morrison, said “This decision amounts to nothing less than a complete betrayal. Our communities can never again trust a Conservative MP to ensure that our cities, towns and villages get the transport links that they deserve.\n“Conservative MPs in Greater Manchester and the North have utterly failed to stand up for our region.

According to the Environment Agency, sewage discharge from the water industry is one of the sources of the phosphates in the Goyt. One particular sewage out flow near Otterspool Road was open for 1362 hours - eight weeks in total - in 2021, discharging directly into the River Goyt.\nLiberal Democrat Campaigner Lisa Smart organised volunteers to take phosphate samples of the River Goyt at Chadkirk and Brabyns Park near areas where dogs and people swim, play, fish and paddle.\nLisa said:\n\"We know that raw sewage is being discharged in rivers by water companies. The Conservatives allowed this by refusing for time after time to impose controls on these companies dumping sewage and for making cuts to environmental protection. We will have to wait 13 years - until 2035 - for the Government's weak targets to come into force. This isn't good enough. I want to see tougher rules on water companies now. They're making huge profits, and they need to be made to step up and sort out this problem. The whole thing stinks.\"\nThe recommended level of phosphates in a healthy river should be 0.1 mg per litre. The tests by volunteers gave results of 1 mg per litre, around 10 times the recommended limit.\nSamples were also taken at Poise Brook, which runs through Torkington Park in Hazel Grove and Offerton. The results showed Poise Brook had around 5 times the recommended limit for phosphates.\nCouncillor Mark Roberts, who is Cabinet Member for Climate Change and the Environment, said: “I was shocked to learn of the levels of pollution in our rivers and streams that is permitted by the Conservative government. There was an opportunity to take real action and they have failed us all. I've been contacted by local people asking if it is safe in our waterways for children to paddle, dogs to play, or go wild swimming. Given what I have seen I certainly couldn’t recommend it. This is heart-breaking, I loved rock pooling as a child and it helped foster my interest in nature and our environment, a new generation will grow up being unable to enjoy our beautiful rivers unless the national Government takes action. Sewage in our rivers in this day and age is a national scandal.\"\nLisa has shared the results with the Mersey Rivers Trust, who work to promote healthy rivers. Lisa is also encouraging concerned local residents to volunteer for the River Guardian scheme organised by the Mersey Rivers Trust or the Angling Trust's 'Anglers Against Pollution' monitoring campaign.",

When that has happened, it is already too late.”\nThe response from the Minister also states that local bodies, such as Safer Roads Greater Manchester can institute their own guidance for when to install speed cameras. However, the local bodies are understandably wary of adopting local standards which conflict with the national guidance.\nLisa continued: “The Department of Transport is trying to shift the blame on to local bodies such as Safer Roads Greater Manchester, and they are in turn putting the blame back on the DfT.\n“What is clear is that if the Department of Transport weren’t three years late in revising this advice, this could all be resolved, and it could be much easier for us to have speed cameras installed where the local community knows they are needed – saving lives before it is too late.",

This would have removed much-needed support at stations at a time when we should be striving to improve public transport.\n“This shows that people can stand up and stop poor decisions from being taken. We need MPs who stand up for people with disabilities, who make it easier for people to use public transport, and who choose fairness instead of cutting costs.”\nHowever, reports also quote railway company bosses saying: “All of these plans were approved by officials and ministers at the DfT.” Sadly this means that these plans are likely to re-emerge from the current Conservative Government.

It concerns me that instead of being able to tell us what funds are available for repairs – and let’s not forget that we keep seeing pictures of flooding and collapsing buildings – they are instead abandoning targets.”\nTom Morrison MP added: “Scrapping these targets is admitting defeat. We have had years of the previous Conservative government running our NHS into the ground. We want change, we want competence, and we want people getting to grip with the problems, not closing their eyes to them.\n“Ministers must urgently rethink this approach, reinstate the pledge and take steps to winterproof the NHS to make this the last winter crisis the health service and patients ever have to experience.”",

In the first four months of this Government, what we have seen is far too much ‘more of the same’.\n“We can all see the impact of the years of underfunding by the last Conservative Government with our own eyes – the flooded corridors, failing fittings and collapsing ceilings. We need change.”\nThere was no mention of additional funding in the budget in the letter from the Department of Health, and pre-budget briefings have so far focused on saving money, rather than allocating it to urgently needed hospital funding.\nTom Morrison MP added: “I want to see the Chancellor stand up next week and prioritise social care and the NHS. The Labour Government has held back – we called for an emergency budget immediately after the election.\n“They have taken their time on this – the residents of Stockport deserve to see the results, and that is a clear plan for immediate repairs at Stepping Hill, and a long-term solution with a new additional hospital site in the town centre.

It also affects responses as far afield as Poynton and Macclesfield – with Offerton fire crews regularly responding over the Cheshire border, despite this not being included in the data that the proposal has been based upon.\nLisa Smart, Liberal Democrat Parliamentary Candidate and Councillor for Bredbury Green and Romiley – one of the affected areas, said: “The fire and rescue service is a vital emergency service. Crews based at Offerton Fire Station perform an heroic task keeping our community safe. Local people are understandably worried that a reduction in cover and the resulting increase in response times will make local people less safe. We are calling on the Labour Mayor and Deputy Mayor to make the right decision and reject these proposals.\n“We look forward to questioning the plans - and the data they are based upon - at the upcoming Extraordinary Scrutiny meeting called for next week.\"\nThe consultation on the changes is open to local residents to respond until July 5, and the Liberal Democrats are seeking to ensure as many people are aware of the consultation and respond to it as possible, as many residents in Marple, Bredbury, Romiley and Hazel Grove may be unaware of the impact the ending of 24/7 cover in Offerton will have on them.\nLisa continued: “If this is a justified decision, decision-makers should be able to easily respond to our questions. If they can’t, then we don’t know that this decision is being taken for the right reasons. People’s lives are at risk if the wrong decisions are taken about where to station fire crews. Surely the Labour Mayor and his deputy must see that that is too important a decision to be made without listening properly to the people on the ground – the fire crews and the people whose lives are in their hands.”",

We’ve seen years of problems with crumbling buildings at Stepping Hill Hospital with the final straw being the closure of the Outpatients B department late last year, following a “significant deterioration” in the building.\n“That’s why I am calling for a new, central hospital for Stockport to provide crucial services that Stepping Hill is struggling to provide.”\nUnder the proposals, critical services would be moved to a central site at a town centre site – for example, the outpatients services which have been scattered across the current facility after the Outpatients B closure.\nThe target is to then add key services to this site in the centre of Stockport, next to the new transport interchange – and ideally next to a new Metrolink line that Stockport also been campaigning for – and then rebuild higher quality buildings for specialist services at the current Stepping Hill site.\nLisa continued: “For years the Conservative Government has been promising ‘40 new hospitals’, and not even pretending to deliver them.\n“Well I’m demanding that Stockport gets the new hospital that it needs, and that you deserve. High quality, accessible and central.\n“This will not only be the fastest possible solution to the closure of the Outpatients B department, it will be a long-term approach which will allow us to renovate what the NHS admit is the ‘ageing estate’ at Stepping Hill.”\nSign below to add your name to the petition to the Secretary of State for Health for a new hospital\nUrgent repairs are needed for Stepping Hill Hospital, with buildings being condemned, corridors flooded, and light fittings falling out of ceilings.

Along with her work to tackle upskirting she has made a real, genuine legislative difference in this Parliament, and that is why we get Liberal Democrats elected.”\nCheadle candidate Tom Morrison said: “Across our communities, people are struggling after years and years of neglect by this Conservative Government.\n“On the doorsteps, you speak to people who are living in areas where you wouldn’t expect them to struggle, but they are. I particularly remember one woman, who worked full time and made sensible choices, she saved, she paid into a pension. But due to the rise in energy prices, in food costs, and the doubling of her mortgage, she was now struggling. She had done everything right to keep her family secure and safe, but through no fault of her own, it was not enough.\n“The Conservatives have tanked the economy, they have stretched our NHS to breaking point and have left millions of people struggling to live day by day. MPs like Mary Robinson and William Wragg supported every decision the Government has made, and they need to be stopped.\n“We can be the people who stop them.”",
  "https_www_lisasmart_org_uk_/https_www_lisasmart_org_uk_news_article_dft-speed-camera-guidance-desperately-overdue/content_142.html": "DfT speed camera guidance desperately overdue\nThe Department for Transport is over three years late in revising a crucial piece of safety information for local councils on the use of speed cameras, in what Liberal Democrat parliamentary candidate Lisa Smart has called the Government’s “apparent disregard for road safety measures”.\nCouncillor Smart, the parliamentary candidate for Hazel Grove constituency, has written to Minister Richard Holden MP, demanding transparency and clarity on why the information – DfT circular 01/2007 – has not been updated, and calling for local communities to be able to determine the best location for speed cameras.\nShe said: “The outdated guidance not only hinders our ability to address modern road safety issues, but also undermines the confidence of the public in the government’s commitment to safeguarding the lives of road users.\n“Time and again when I talk to people in our area, they raise speeding traffic and road safety as the most important issue. The current guidance limits the use of fixed speed cameras to locations where there have been at least three serious injuries or deaths. To many local people, this makes no sense whatsoever.”\nOver a thousand people signed a petition in Hazel Grove to get Safer Roads Greater Manchester to update their guidance on the location of speed cameras, but they have refused to make changes – citing the out-of-date advice from the DfT as their reason.\nLisa said: “People’s lives are at stake. If this Government really was the motorists’ friend, it would be putting effective safety measures in place so that there were fewer tragic incidents involving drivers.\n“That the Government has failed to meet its own deadlines, by such a long way, without providing any reason for doing so, really does show where their priorities are, and they aren’t with people in our area who want common sense to hold sway on speed cameras.”",

However, if there are no surgeries in the area doing that, it seems likely to drive those dentists to work elsewhere, making the situation worse, not better.\n“Tooth decay is consistently the number one reason for hospital admissions among children.

Environmental campaigners have warned that sewage discharges in 2022 – which went on for an eye-watering 2.4 million hours – were still lower than they could have been due to low rainfall levels, and that this year’s higher rainfall levels are likely to mean substantial increases.\nLisa Smart, the Liberal Democrat parliamentary candidate for Hazel Grove constituency, said: “We know that United Utilities dumped sewage into the River Goyt for nearly 1,000 hours in 2022. In the north west, we have now had well above average rainfall in January, March, June and July, which is likely to mean that we have had even greater levels of sewage dumping.\n“It is outrageous that companies are being allowed to get away with this.”\nWhile Thames Water has started providing real time data on sewage dumping, United Utilities are among the many companies who have refused to do so, meaning that people will not be able to find out the condition of local rivers right now until March next year.\nLisa continued: “We know that this data could be provided; we also know that United Utilities needs to invest heavily into its measuring equipment so that it can properly assess the damage being done – but they haven’t done it yet.\n“It is galling to see United Utilities paying out bumper dividends to shareholders again and again – another £300 million was paid out this year – and yet they can’t even tell us how much sewage they are putting into local rivers.\n“The Liberal Democrats have managed to change legislation to hold the water companies to account, but this failing Tory government seems determined to ignore the problems and let them carry on destroying our rivers.

Government guidance from 2018 encourages local authorities to implement schemes in residential streets and village centres; but later that year they said they had no plans to implement it nationally. In 2020 they committed to introducing it as the default, but have since refused to introduce any legislation to do so – despite Wales and Scotland doing so.\nLisa Smart, Liberal Democrat Parliamentary Candidate for Hazel Grove constituency, said: “This Government needs to listen to everyone – and I hear time and time again on the doorstep that road safety is a top concern in our area.\n“These endless u-turns are just throwing money away. The Government drove the introduction of low-traffic neighbourhoods for years, spending £200 million on pushing them through in 2021 – now they are blocking their introduction.”\nAt the same time that the Government is throwing away road safety schemes, there are huge proposed cuts to the public transport system in the form of ticket office closures across the rail network and the removal of the Northern Powerhouse rail line through Bradford, and they are dragging their feet bringing in up-to-date guidance on speed cameras. People are being forced onto the roads because they have no choice, while attempts to make them safer are being cut.\nLisa continued: “We just want road safety measures that work. We’d be in a much better place if Rishi Sunak’s Government spent more time on making sure local communities can introduce 20mph zones safely and effectively. 20mph schemes are safer, make driving cheaper, and reduce environmental damage.\n“They should be win–win, but this Tory policy roundabout just means a clown show on our roads.”",

A proper opposition in Westminster will champion the people’s priorities – and that is what we will provide.”\nLeader of the Liberal Democrats, Ed Davey said: “My new frontbench will champion the people’s priorities, ensuring we hold the new government to account as a responsible opposition.\n“I am humbled by the result of the General Election and the millions of voters who put their trust in the Liberal Democrats, including many for the first time.

Let’s look to places like Tallinn or Zlin; let’s look at the 49 Euro ticketing across Germany, to see what happens when either free or very low cost one-off ticket options are offered to passengers in cities across the world.

The Government must realise how urgent this is. This is a measure that would help millions in this country overnight, there is also no clear evidence that the cap has any positive effect on productivity in this country. The Stockport Liberal Democrats are clear that Sir Keir Starmer must change his mind and end this policy immediately .\nThe call is consistent with the Liberal Democrats manifesto in the 2024 General Election, but the new Labour Government have resisted against prioritising this measure, on the basis of “tough choices”.\nCllr Jilly Julian, Cabinet Member for Finance said: “For us the choice is very simple- the quickest and most cost-effective way of reducing child poverty is if the Government were to remove the cap. 8% of children in Stockport are impacted by the limit, to make it worse, any families that are affected missed out on £3,235 per child in 2023/24.

So bad in fact that the all-party Local Government Association immediately convened an emergency special conference - which took place on Tuesday of this week - to discuss a unified response from local government in the face of such chronic underfunding.\n“It's worth noting that the LGA's own assessment of the funding shortfall is that councils in England face a funding gap of £4billion next year, presenting a serious challenge for every authority in setting a balanced budget.”\nCllr Hunter outlined some of the key challenges Stockport Council faces, including:\n- The energy bills for the property estate have more than doubled between 2019/20 and 2023/24;\n- The cost of bin collections has risen by 35% from 2019/20 to 2023/25 costing an additional £2.5m per year;\n- Meeting Real Living Wage obligations to the social care market and the council’s supply chain will cost an additional £5.8m next year;\n- The cost of transporting children with special education needs has nearly tripled between 2019/20 and 2023/24 with an increase of over £4m and expected to rise significantly further next year;\n- The cost of supporting children looked after in external placements and foster care has nearly doubled between 2019/20 and 2023/24 costing over £11m more.\nSeconding the motion, Cllr Jilly Julian, Cabinet Member with responsibility for Finance said: “The Minister for Local Government, Director for Local Government & DLUHC, Shadow Minister, Local Govt Association – are all in agreement that multi-year settlements are vital. And yet we have been given yet another one year settlement.\n“Multi-year settlements would enable so much. Think of the intrinsic and extrinsic value that could be driven by being able to forecast with certainty over a longer period. The continuity. The economies of scale. Think of the difference that could be made to lives in our borough by leveraging that additional value.\n“Funding pots to be applied for ad-hoc, being encouraged to plug gaps with reserves, advice being given to sell assets – these are all the minister’s suggested ways to resolve challenges in revenue budgets. Once more for those at the back – that’s one-off money, it is not there to cover recurring spend. If this doesn’t demonstrate that government are simply kicking the issue of financial sustainability for critical, locally delivered services down the road to be a future parliament’s problem, I don’t know what would.”",

We knew that a new Labour government was likely to mean changes to planning and housebuilding would be coming down the track, but we faced a deadline of June 2025 to have submitted a Local Plan for inspection by the Planning Inspectorate and therefore had to press on immediately after the General Election.\n“The plan we had ready was a Local Plan for Stockport that would have delivered the right homes in the right places and the right planning policies to protect our environment and the local character of our borough whilst delivering sustainable growth. It took account of local residents’ concerns about developing on our precious Green Belt, damaging our local environment and the very things that makes Stockport such a lovely place to live. Seven of the nine other authorities in Greater Manchester who continued with the GM Spatial Framework/Places for Everyone face a similar increase in housing targets despite claims made by Labour locally.\n“It is now clear that, both locally and nationally, Labour doesn’t care about these concerns or the impact the colossal increase in mandatory housing targets will have.\n“Nationally, Labour are saying “we know what’s best for you”, whilst locally they are saying “don’t build in our back yard”, creating nonsensical scare stories about filling the town centre with skyscrapers. It is really disappointing to see their local leadership turning their backs on the collaborative, cross party approach to the much-needed regeneration and investment in our town and district centres and which brought a Mayoral Development Corporation to Stockport.”\nCouncillor Mark Hunter, Leader of the Council and of the Lib Dems at Stockport Town Hall added: “We absolutely accept the urgent need for the right mix of homes, including affordable and social housing, but there is no easy solution to this. Labour seem to be making the same mistake as their Conservative predecessors in giving the power and profits to developers ahead of allowing local people to shape the place we live in. Their plans to ignore residents’ wishes and concrete over the green spaces that they hold dear was not mentioned in any of the leaflets they delivered across the borough in the recent local or national elections.\n“We will continue to work towards delivering a Local Plan which protects the character of the borough and which delivers the right homes in the right places, taking a ‘brownfield first’ approach, using previously developed land, but it seems clear the Government will force us to build on the Green Belt to meet their centrally-imposed housing target. I firmly believe that central government targets, however well intended, should never trump local decision making.”",

Instead, people across our area are faced with a stark choice between expensive private care and no care at all. This has to change.\nWe believe urgent reform of the NHS contract is required to ensure that the dentists that we already have deliver NHS services.\nIn summer 2023, the last dentist supplying NHS services in Romiley withdrew them. Many other dentists across the whole of the constituency have already withdrawn from supplying NHS services.

The Plan, a statutory requirement, will be subject to full public consultation and detailed examination through the Council’s all-party scrutiny process.\nConsultation on the Local Plan was paused last year when the then Conservative Secretary of State decided to update the National Policy Planning Framework and fundamentally change some of the requirements, this took a year to do.\nWith the Labour governments election last week, there could be more changes to planning policy on the horizon, with continued uncertainty but with a fast-approaching hard deadline for submission, Stockport Liberal Democrats are ensuring that any local plan is rooted with the backing of the local public.\nDeputy Leader of the Council and lead on the Local Plan, Cllr Mark Roberts, said: “The local plan is an enormous piece of work and an opportunity for local people to have their say. It is about us all taking the reins and having Stockport’s future in our own hands.\n“The Liberal Democrats know our residents want us to protect the greenbelt, tackle climate change and deliver the much-needed right homes in the right places. This is done by delivering a true brownfield first approach (previously developed land) focusing on predeveloped land, bringing neglected and underused sites back into use. Land that is now derelict can be transformed into homes, businesses, and community hubs, all whilst avoiding unnecessarily getting rid of greenbelt land, land that will be gone forever once developed on.\n“The local plan we’re putting forward provides the good quality homes that the people of Stockport want for their families, whilst still protecting the green spaces that make our borough so special. Furthermore, it is our strongest policy tool to tackle the climate crisis that impacts us all and ensures that the houses being built are modern, energy efficient homes fit for the future.\n“In the coming weeks and months, residents will be able to have their say on our plan, it’s their chance to be able to help shape what our borough will look like in the coming decades. We want local people to have their say loud and clear to make sure the wishes of people living in Stockport get heard.”",

The call for investment comes as the Council has said it is looking for sources of investment to improve ageing facilities.\nThe successful motion was submitted to the council meeting last evening, while Stockport Labour tabled an amendment that would remove the direct call for a “new government to provide funds”. Labours amendment was unsuccessful, and all councillors subsequently supported the Liberal Democrat motion.\nCllr Jilly Julian, Cabinet Member for Finance said: “There is clear consensus across the chamber that we need more support from the Government. All parties supported our motion in calling for this support, and we look forward to working with members from across the borough to ensure that our leisure facilities are given the support they need.”\nThe debate was raised as Labour reported the fact that the aging leisure estate would need investment as a “bombshell”, despite Stockport Labour leading the council for 6 of the last 8 years.\n“The most effective way for local government to recover from year-on-year cuts and be in a position where they can offer the facilities residents deserve is through a proper plan, ambition, and support from the Government. Inadequate funding for our leisure estate has been an issue for the last decade, we’re looking to tackle the issue head on and get the funding it needs.”"
