  "https_www_felicitybuchan_com_/https_www_felicitybuchan_com_campaigns_stop-tfls-proposed-holland-park-roundabout-cycle-lane/content_24.html": "TfL is running a consultation on whether to introduce a new cycle lane on Holland Park Roundabout. The consultation closes on March 3rd and you can email TfL at [email protected]k or respond to the consultation here. I encourage you to email TfL.\nI am calling on residents to join my campaign to stop TfL's proposed cycle lane on Holland Park Roundabout. My campaign is supported by RBKC, Tony Devenish AM and Action Disability Kensington and Chelsea. In addition, local Residents’ Associations have renewed their longstanding campaign against TfL’s plans to create segregated cycleways on Holland Park Avenue, Notting Hill Gate and now Holland Park Roundabout.\nSign my petition now! LINK: www.felicitybuchan.com/tell-tfl-your-views\nMap shows new bike crossings (white dotted lines) and new two-way cycle lane (beige pathway). Left to right: Holland Park Avenue, Holland Road, Shepherd’s Bush Green.\nThe changes TfL would like to make include (view detailed slides here):\n- Reducing Traffic lanes on Holland Park Avenue heading Westbound from three to two lanes on approach to the junction.\n- Removing the innermost traffic lane from the Holland Park Avenue Junction to the Holland Road Junction on the Roundabout itself.\n- Removing a lane of traffic heading Westbound on Shepherd’s Bush Green.\n- Introducing a two-way cycle lane from Holland Park Avenue along the southern side of Holland Park Roundabout to the eastern side of Shepherd’s Bush Green.\n- Introducing a priority bus lane heading Westbound on Shepherd’s Bush Green.\n- Introducing bike crossings with separate cycle signals at existing traffic lights at junctions.\nTfL proposes to keep the existing cycling infrastructure along the pavement on the south side of the roundabout and in the north side underpass. This new scheme is in addition.\nWhile we all want to see more active travel in Kensington, including walking and cycling, new cycling schemes must balance the needs of all stakeholders, including pedestrians, bus users, local businesses, local residents and other road users.\nI want to ensure the safety of cyclists, and I am supportive of measures to improve cycling safety but I do not believe this scheme gets that balance right.\nI am opposing TfL’s proposals for the following primary reasons:\n1. Impact on traffic flows – this scheme will increase congestion on Holland Park Avenue, Notting Hill Gate, Holland Road, Holland Park Roundabout, Shepherd’s Bush Green and West Cross Route and have a knock-on effect on traffic across the Borough.\n2. Increased air pollution - increased congestion will lead to increases in air pollution.\n3. Damage to local businesses - heavy traffic on Holland Park Avenue will discourage residents and non-residents from shopping on Holland Park Avenue and Notting Hill Gate, risking the viability of some of the businesses.\n4. Traffic displacement onto side streets - heavy traffic on main roads will encourage motorists to use residential side streets on either side of Holland Park Avenue, Notting Hill Gate and Holland Road, creating additional risk to pedestrians using these roads.\n5. Bus and emergency vehicle journey times - increased congestion will lead to longer journey times for bus users and emergency vehicles, disproportionately affecting elderly and disabled people as well as those in need of medical attention.\n6. Existing cycling facilities - there is already cycling infrastructure on the roundabout to support cycling which made up 4.5% of London journeys in 2022.\n7. Precursor to extension - if approved, we believe this scheme will be used as a precursor to reignite controversial plans to extend the cycle highway up Holland Park Avenue and Notting Hill Gate.\nQuotes:\nFelicity Buchan MP: “While I am supportive of cycling and improving cycling safety, this scheme is ill-thought through. It will lead to increased traffic congestion, increased pollution, and traffic displacement to residential side streets. I am therefore opposing the scheme.”\nCllr Cem Kemahli: “This scheme works for TFL but fails for the residents of RBKC - we cannot support more restrictions on the efficient flow of traffic on our network.”\nTony Devenish AM: “TfL’s latest proposals to remove lanes of traffic to make way for a new cycle lane on Holland Park Roundabout will lead to more congestion, not less. With existing cycling infrastructure already in place on the roundabout, I have to oppose these plans which will lead to more tailbacks on our roads.”\nAction Disability Kensington and Chelsea: \"We appreciate TfL’s aims to encourage cycling but we believe this scheme will lead to more traffic congestion while disadvantaging disabled and visually impaired people who disproportionately rely on public transport and safe pathways for pedestrians.\"",

Lawful basis for processing\nAll processing is carried out by consent or either under the legitimate interest of Felicity Buchan, or public interest. These cover processing to conduct casework, campaigning and communication. Where processed under the lawful basis of a task carried out in the public interest, it is to support or promote democratic engagement. This includes fundraising activity in order to support democratic engagement.\n4. Data sources\nData held is that provided by you when you contact us and correspondence with third parties in response to cases taken up on your behalf. We may also hold data that you provide when we contact you – for instance, if we ask you to participate in a survey or petition. If you do not wish for us to contact you by telephone please do not provide this information. We perform a database lookup automatically upon any form submission to include electoral boundary data.

Review of the data held will occur in each election cycle to determine whether it should be maintained or put beyond use. We also comply with the ICO's expectation guidelines relating to petitions.\n9. Subject Access Requests\nWe will request verification of the identity of any individual making a request, ask for further clarification and details if needed and respond within one calendar month once we have confirmed it is a legitimate request. In accordance with ICO guidelines, we keep a log of Subject Access Requests that contains details of the request, including that which can identify you personally, indefinitely.\nData subjects have the right to the following:\n• To be told whether any personal data is being processed\n• To be given a description of the personal data, the reasons it is being processed and whether it will be given to another organisations or people.\n• To be given a copy of the information comprising the data, and given details of the source of the data where this is available.\n10.

Any third parties that we may share your data with are obliged to keep your details securely, and to use them only for the basis upon which they were originally intended.\nWe may need to share your data with a third party, such as the police, if required to do so by law.\nUnless otherwise specified, data may also be shared with entities of Political Party associations, federations, branches, groups and affiliates in order to assist you or maintain contact with you in support of democratic engagement.\nCasework and other submissions from the Contact form are sent directly to their destination. The nature of casework and other enquiries are not retained on the website, but this information is available for a limited period on the Bluetree servers in the UK for access only in the event of a police investigation. Your name and contact details submitted via the Contact form are only retained on the website if you grant consent to join the email subscriptions list. Anonymised data from the Contact form is retained for benchmarking purposes.\nYour personal data is only used as outlined here and within your reasonable expectations based on the nature of the communication, and recognising the need of politically related engagement in wider support of democratic engagement.\n11.

If you haven’t already done so, please send an email to TfL stating your objection, and sign and share my petition!\nClick here to send the template email to TfL\nClick here to sign and share the petition\nNew Traffic Data\nTfL did not carry out any local traffic assessment modelling on Holland Park Roundabout. That’s why the Holland Park Avenue Traders Association commissioned an independent agency to conduct a traffic modelling study which shows that the proposed scheme will lead to substantial traffic delays.\n- A typical queue in peak morning hours (8-9am) would increase\n- On Holland Park Avenue, from 19 vehicles to 170 vehicles (795% increase) creating an average 12-minute wait time.\n- On Holland Road, from 24 vehicles to 78 vehicles (225% increase) creating an average 5-minute wait time.\n- A typical queue in peak afternoon hours (6-7pm) would increase\n- On Holland Park Avenue, from 49 vehicles to 127 vehicles (159% increase) creating an average 11-minute wait time.\n- On Holland Road, from 52 vehicles to 206 vehicles (296% increase) creating an average of 7-minute wait time.\nThis will lead to:\n- Increased traffic displacement to local residential streets\n- Increased risk of accidents due to ‘stop/start’ nature of queues\n- Significant bus delays\n- Less pass-by trade for the shops along Holland Park Avenue\nYou can read the full report HERE.\nMisleading Collision Data\nIn addition, the analysis of the accident data TfL used over the same 3-year period shows that TfL’s reference to 54 accidents is highly misleading. We have only identified 1 cycle accident (classified as slight) and no pedestrian accidents on the roundabout.\nThese 2 analyses call into serious question the main justifications used by TfL to implement this scheme – namely, that the scheme will increase cycle safety on the roundabout and will not negatively impact other modes of transport, including much needed buses and emergency vehicles.\nSo if you haven’t already done so, please send an email to TfL stating your objection, and sign and share my petition!\nClick here to send the template email to TfL\nClick here to sign and share the petition\nThank you for your continued support on this campaign.",

She attended a local comprehensive school before studying law at Christ Church, Oxford.\nShe began her career working for JPMorgan in 1991. Over 10 years at JPMorgan she worked in both London and New York, in M&A, fixed income trading, syndicate and capital markets.\nShe left JPMorgan in 2001 to join Bank of America as a managing director, running its European corporate debt capital markets division.\nLiving in Kensington & Chelsea for more than 25 years, she has been an involved member of our community both before and after becoming the local MP at the 2019 General Election. She has volunteered at a North Kensington children’s charity and was the Chair of Governors of Bousfield Primary School. She believes it is the honour of her life to represent her local community.\nOn the 8th of September 2022, she was appointed as Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury before becoming Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Housing and Homeless, a position she has held since the 30th of October 2022.\nIn her ministerial role, she is responsible for tackling rough sleeping and homelessness as well as Ukrainian, Hong Kong and Afghan resettlement. The UK has the third lowest rough sleeping rate in the World behind South Korea and Japan with around 3,000 rough sleepers across England. However, every rough sleeper is one too many. That’s why the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC) has a budget of over £2bn over 3 years to end rough sleeping for good and reduce homelessness.\nAs part of her resettlement portfolio, she is responsible for Homes for Ukraine. The UK has welcomed almost 200,000 Ukrainians to the UK since Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and many Kensington families have welcomed Ukrainians into their homes and communities. Similarly, the UK has welcomed 192,000 Hong Kongers, and almost 25,000 Afghans – she is responsible for their integration.\nWhen she gets time away from politics, she enjoys travelling and meeting friends and family in Kensington’s excellent restaurants, museums and galleries.\nLots Done\nSince becoming the MP for Kensington in 2019, we've achieved a lot for our area.\nHere are some of the highlights:\n-\nCampaigned for and secured £20m from Government for a carbon-neutral overhaul of Lancaster West Estate\n-\nCampaigned for and secured £32m of Government investment for Morley College to support jobs and skills\n-\nIntroduced a private members bill, adopted by Government, to compel new builds to provide electric vehicle charging points\n-\nCampaigned successfully to save local buses including the 14, 31, 74, N74, C3, 19, 27, 49, 414 and the 430 from Sadiq Khan's cuts\n-\nCampaigned for and worked closely with Kensington and Chelsea Council to implement a Public Spaces Protection Order in Earl's Court to tackle anti-social behaviour\n-\nSecured support for local museums during Covid\n-\nPut pressure on Thames Water to install over 140 flooding protection devices in Kensington homes since the 2021 floods to keep residents safe\n-\nCampaigned for and secured hundreds of new TfL staff across the network to stop the disruptive closures of our local tube stations\n-\nDelivered the Homes for Ukraine program as a Minister and helped over 100 Ukrainians find a new home in Kensington as a local MP\n-\nCampaigned successfully for Government to extend the £400 Energy relief payment to residents in mansion blocks\n-\nHandled over 30,000 pieces of casework and correspondence\n-\nDelivered an additional police officer to every neighbourhood in Kensington\n-\nProactively engaged with residents and the council to green and plant more trees on High Street Kensington and local streets like Bracewell Road\n-\nCampaigned for and secured £10m from Government to green and retrofit local schools, reducing our carbon footprint locally\nMore To Do\nWe've achieved a lot, but we can always do more to make Kensington and Bayswater an ever better place to live.\nIf re-elected, I want to achieve the following in the next Parliament:\n-\nDeliver even more police on our streets\n-\nSave Notting Hill Police Station put putting pressure on the Mayor to reopen it or sell it to Kensington and Chelsea Council\n-\nElectrify our local bus routes by 2030\n-\nGet construction underway to completely rebuild St Mary's Hospital\n-\nDeliver more flooding protection devices to Kensington and Bayswater properties at risk of flooding\n-\nImplement a Public Spaces Protection Order in Bayswater and Lancaster Gate to crack down on crime and antisocial behaviour\n-\nEnsure patients retain access to their GP surgery on demand\n-\nCampaign for further decarbonisation of council properties across Kensington and Bayswater\n-\nWork with local councils to install more electric vehicle charging points\n-\nSupport the findings and recommendations of the Grenfell Tower Inquiry\n-\nWork with residents to ensure major developments in Earl's Court and Kensal Canalside deliver affordable housing in keeping with our area\n-\nCampaign against proposals to introduce VAT on independent schools",

Other patients’ calls will be directed to these hubs where they will be assigned to a pharmacist, physiotherapist or a GP (but not necessarily their own GP).\nI believe that we need to retain the link between patients and their GP surgeries. I am very concerned by the lack of consultation on these far-reaching proposals.\nI am calling on residents to join my campaign to ensure that there is a full consultation with patients and GPs before any changes are implemented and that we keep the link between patients and their GP surgeries.\nSign my petition NOW!\nWatch my video with a local GP here: https://youtube.com/shorts/4R2PINz_u18\nI have concerns with the proposals for the following primary reasons:\n- GPs and patients have not been consulted on these proposals.\n- Patients will lose continuity of care with their local GP practices.\n- The person doing the triage at the area hub may not be a doctor but someone with lower qualifications.\n- Patients may have to travel further to a different practice or other medical provider to receive treatment.\n- This is likely to put more pressure on A&E as patients not offered a GP appointment may present at A&E.\nQuotes:\nFelicity Buchan MP: ‘We need to retain the link between patients and their GP surgeries. The local NHS need to consult doctors and patients on these far-reaching proposals to ensure we continue to deliver high quality primary care here in Kensington.’\nWest London GP: ‘Triage by receptionists in hubs away from our own doctors’ surgeries breaks continuity of care and we need to simplify our access in the NHS, not add further confusion and replace doctors with call centres’.\nGolborne Medical Centre GP: ‘Same day access hubs threaten the quality and safety of primary care by replacing your GP with a non-doctor who does not know you, in a separate location from your general practice and who is not professionally accountable’.\nCllr Josh Rendall, RBKC Lead Member for Health and Adult Social Care: ‘This proposal by the local NHS is confusing and unclear. It’s causing great concern for GPs, patients, and other service users. I’m supporting Felicity’s campaign to ensure the local NHS is clear what it wants to achieve and to urge them to publicly meet with residents so they can put their proposals forward for open consultation’.\nCllr Lucy Knight: ‘I am very glad that ICS leaders have listened to the voices of residents, GPs and patients and pressed pause on their same-day access plans that were due to be rolled out. They must now take the time to properly engage and listen, so we can ensure this new model of care is one that is co-produced by those that know primary care best.’\nOther Background Information\nThe plans were announced by North West London NHS in February and were originally intended to come into effect in April. After pressure from GPs, local patients and me that has been delayed by a year making it no longer mandatory for primary care networks to implement the proposals. However, the local NHS has not committed to a proper consultation and has not rolled back their plans.\nThe local NHS has said there is a national imperative driving their decision to move towards same day access hubs. I wrote to the Department for Health and Social Care seeking clarification on this point. I received a reply from Andrea Leadsom MP.\nIn that reply the Minister states:\n‘The Department and NHSE do not encourage ICBs to implement any particular model and our position remains that these decisions must be made by clinical staff locally, taking into consideration patient choice and incorporating stakeholder feedback gathered when testing new models.’\nTimeline\nPulse Today reveal local plans for same day access hubs – February 7th\nLINK: https://www.pulsetoday.co.uk/news/workload/gp-practices-to-stop-same-da…\nNHS officially announce plans on their website – February 22nd\nLINK: https://www.nwlondonicb.nhs.uk/news/news/improving-same-day-access-prim…\nNHS issue update to their initial announcement outlining adjustments and clarification – March 6th\nLINK: https://www.nwlondonicb.nhs.uk/news/news/update-gp-same-day-access-planning-response-feedback\nPulse Today releases update on the plans including local NHS claims of a national imperative – March 21st\nAndrea Leadsom MP writes to Felicity Buchan MP – March 27th\nLINK: Minister Writes to Felicity Buchan MP on GP Same Day Access | Felicity Buchan",
