She submitted this petition to the Mayor of London, TfL and Barnet Council.\nWelcoming the news that the bus lane plans have been dropped, the former MP for Chipping Barnet said, “I fought strongly against these damaging and disruptive proposals from Barnet Council and TfL.”\n“They would have caused huge amounts of unnecessary congestion. High street shops and businesses would have been badly hit and many many thousands of journeys would have been disrupted. So many people told me how strongly opposed they were to these bus lanes, including local traders.”\n“During my 19 years as MP, I don’t remember anyone getting in touch with me to ask for new bus lanes in either of these locations. They were just another example of Labour’s ideological anti-car approach. At last, residents in Barnet have been heard on this and I am pleased to have ensured they could get their views across, loud and clear.”\n“But Labour have not yet cancelled their proposal for an unnecessary bus lane in Barnet High Street. I am encouraging people to respond to the consultation which has opened on this, so we can kill off this misguided measure as we did the plans for Whetstone and Cat Hill.”\nResidents can respond to the Barnet Council consultation on Barnet High Street bus lanes here.\nDigital imprint: Promoted by Theresa Villiers of 163 High Street, Barnet, Herts, EN5 5SU.",

  "http_www_theresavilliers_co_uk_/http_www_theresavilliers_co_uk_news_villiers-will-be-indian-century/content_14.html": "The following article was recently published on the website of educational consultants, Finito World, in which Theresa highlights to increasingly important role on the world stage that India is likely to play over the decades to come. Theresa has a longstanding interest in India and raised matters relevant to the country in Parliament during her time as MP for Chipping Barnet:\n\"I believe this will be an Indian century and if the UK is going to seize the opportunities that presents, we need to step up our engagement with India.\nIn my former role as MP for Barnet, I was privileged to represent a significant British Indian community. This has left me with an enduring enthusiasm for India.\nThe country has made phenomenal economic progress over recent years, with growth accelerated by reforms delivered by the Prime Minister Modi’s Government. It is already an economic superpower. It recently became the fifth largest economy in the world, and analysts predict it could overtake Germany and Japan to hit the third place spot by 2027.\nIndia is well-positioned to take advantage of the growing realization in the west that over-dependence on China poses serious risks our prosperity and security. The Covid pandemic starkly demonstrated the pressing need to diversify global supply chains and reduce reliance on China. That makes India a more important partner than ever before.\nOur two countries clearly have much in common. English continues to be one of India’s most important official languages. The principle of rule of law is accepted, and the common law system in operation when India gained its independence remains in use.\nDespite these positive legacies of empire, we should not be naïve about the colonial era. In their near 200 year involvement with India, the British authorities frequently adopted approaches which would be unacceptable in the modern era. Tragedies such as the 1919 killings at Jallianwala Bagh, when soldiers opened fire on a crowd of unarmed protesters, still cause pain and grievance even today.\nBut 77 years on from the departure of the British from India, the contested aspects of our shared past should not prevent us from capitalizing on the huge amount that we have in common.\nWe should also remember that influence has never been a one way street between our two countries. We may have left India a rail network and a legal system, but they gave us the numerals we use today, including the crucial concept of zero.\nWithout Indian maths we might never have emerged from the Middle Ages in Europe. India’s massive cultural, mathematic and scientific influence on the world dates from as far back as the Greek and Roman era. There should be a much greater awareness of this, and I welcome William Dalrymple’s effort to put that right in his recent book “The Golden Road”.\nA great asset in enabling us to connect with the subcontinent is the Indian diaspora community. Often described as our ‘living bridge’, this community is one of the most successful minorities in Britain. Numbering just under two million according to the 2021 Census, it has strikingly high rates of professional qualifications and employment, and has made a huge contribution to the UK’s culture, economy and public services. Not only did the community give us our first non-white Prime Minister, the NHS would probably collapse without its British Indian doctors!\nBritish Indians have achieved an exemplary balance of integrating enthusiastically into UK society, whilst retaining a vibrant cultural and religious identity. This achievement is too often under-rated and overlooked.\nThere are risks to be managed and hurdles to surmount when doing business in India. Despite the improvements delivered by “Modinomics”, bureaucratic processes can still be cumbersome.\nEven so, India-UK bilateral trade stood at £36.3 billion during the year 2022/23, an increase of 34.2% or £9.2 billion compared the previous year. Moreover, our universities have benefited from a rapid increase in overseas students from India.\nA striking example of the two countries working together successfully was the partnership between Oxford University, AstraZeneca, and Serum Institute of India, which delivered a Covid vaccine in record time.\nIn conclusion, in a world which is becoming increasingly polarized and insecure, strengthening our ties with the planet’s biggest democracy should be a top foreign and trade policy priority.\nIf the UK wants to benefit from Indian prospects and potential over the coming years we need our Government to devote real effort to this. If we don’t put in that work, other western countries will be only too happy to get ahead of us in the queue.\nWe should to deploy the networks of our Indian diaspora community as part of our outreach. We also need a pragmatic approach to visas, so our world class universities can continue to recruit talented Indian students.\nAnd we should actively promote India’s place at the top table of world affairs. Chairing the G20 summit in 2023 was a pivotal moment when India stepped up and assumed a new leadership role in relation to the Global South. As a democratic country that shares so many of our values, far better that India, not China, takes on that mantle.\"",
  "http_www_theresavilliers_co_uk_/http_www_theresavilliers_co_uk_news_speech-parliament-covid-19-crisis/content_23.html": "In the debate in Parliament on emergency legislation on Coronavirus, Theresa Villiers MP highlighted the vital importance of providing the best personal protection equipment for NHS workers...\n\"There can be no doubt that this is an extraordinary Bill for extraordinary times. As others have said this afternoon, when we put our names forward to stand for election to this House none of us must have contemplated the day when we would be asked to back legislation of this kind, but back it we must, and we must do so today.\nIt is hard to find the words to comment intelligently on a situation that has been so exhaustively analysed and debated by the media and in every household and workplace the length and breadth of this country and of much of the rest of the world. Let me provide some reassurance: my slightly hoarse tone relates to a condition that I have had in my vocal cords since August, so it is nothing to do with Covid-19. If it were, I would be back at home self-isolating.\nLet me express my sympathy and support to everyone across the country who is grappling with this disease, who has had their lives turned upside down by this disease, or who have lost loved ones. I have not experienced anything like this in my 15 years in this place, nor, indeed, in my whole lifetime. It is difficult to point to any crisis as severe as this since the flu epidemic of 100 years ago. Of course there have been many political upheavals, especially in the past four years, but there has been nothing that has had such a direct and dramatic impact on the daily lives of every single occupant of these islands, and there is nothing that has come close to matching the potentially devastating impact on our economy.\nIt is welcome that the Government have announced a wholly unprecedented package of support for jobs, wages, businesses and benefits. The plan to stave off economic disaster is a bigger injection of support into our economy than anything that any Government have carried out in our peacetime history. The consequences will be far reaching. We and future generations will be paying off these debts for many years to come, but as a great Prime Minister once said, “There is no alternative.”\nI urge the Chancellor and the Government to ensure that the grants, the loans and the other measures get out to the people who need them as soon as possible—not in three months, not in three weeks, but now. We also do need to find more to help the self-employed and the freelance workers.\nOf course, it is vital that we do all we can to protect the NHS and social care workers. It is at times such as this that we really appreciate how incredibly lucky we are that the NHS is there for us, and how incredibly lucky we are to live in a country that has one of the best healthcare systems in the world, staffed by professionals of outstanding skill and expertise. I want to express my gratitude to every single one of them. If we are to get through this crisis without a massive loss of life, we need to ensure that our NHS staff and our social care staff have the best, most comprehensive personal protection equipment. That means masks that fit properly and equipment that is compliant with World Health Organisation standards.\nWe also need to be testing thousands and thousands of our NHS staff so that we can keep them healthy and keep them on the frontline. The commitment to stepping up testing to 25,000 a day is welcome, and I urge Ministers to ensure that NHS staff are first in the queue.\nI have been contacted by care homes who are crying out for a complete ban on care home visits to help them ensure that they can say no to visitors. For the safety of our elderly relatives and the people who look after them, care home visits must stop.\nIn conclusion, the next few months will test us in a way that none of us, except for the World War Two generation, have ever been tested before. It will be difficult. It will be disruptive. It will be exasperating. It will be, at times, alarming and distressing, but we must as a nation rise to the challenge, and this legislation is part of that. We need a collective effort to keep our loved ones safe from this terrible disease. We must rise to the challenge as previous generations did when they too faced periods of great adversity and hardship. My advice to everyone, and to my constituents in Chipping Barnet is to stay home, stay safe to protect the NHS and save lives.\"",
  "http_www_theresavilliers_co_uk_/http_www_theresavilliers_co_uk_news_conservatives-should-stick-net-zero-targets/content_10.html": "This article by former Environment Secretary, Theresa Villiers, was published in The Spectator on 2nd April 2025:\n\"Giorgia Meloni had it right. ‘There is nothing,’ the Italian prime minister said in 2022, ‘more right-wing than ecology. The right loves the environment because it loves the land, the identity, the homeland.’ Like centre-right parties across Europe, Meloni’s Brothers of Italy party is committed to net zero. While Kemi Badenoch was correct in her recent speech to challenge the way we forge a path to clean energy, I hope that the policy commission she has launched will recommend keeping the goal of ending the UK’s contribution to harmful planet warming.\nThroughout the long history of the Conservative party, we have stood for the principle of protecting the institutions and ways of life that we value for future generations to enjoy. We have championed farming and the countryside, and we introduced the Protection of Birds Act of 1954 and the Clean Air Act of 1956. In the late 1980s, Margaret Thatcher was ahead of her time in warning that water pollution and greenhouse gases could cause ‘irretrievable damage’ to the earth.\nRecent Conservative governments worked hard to protect Britain’s natural environment. Who would have thought in 2010, when renewables made up just 6.8 per cent of our energy generation, that the grid would be getting nearly half its power from renewable and low carbon sources by the time we left office 14 years later?\nThanks to Brexit, new farm payment schemes have replaced the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy, funding space for nature and delivering one of the most important environmental reforms for decades. Restoring domestic control over our fisheries has led to tougher protection for the marine environment, and the Blue Belt safeguards an area of ocean larger than India. Under Boris Johnson, the Conservatives were the first government in the world to make a legally binding commit to halt species decline by 2030. A future Conservative government should build upon these successes.\nKemi’s policy commission should consider the cost of climate change, not just the cost of net zero. Her speech expressed understandable concern about the cost of decarbonisation, but this needs to be weighed against the huge financial damage that will be caused if global heating continues unchecked. Flooding, for example, already costs the UK £2.2 billion a year. The Labour government strained in the Spring Statement to increase the defence budget this exact amount. Growing crops in the Global South will become more difficult in many areas as a result of desertification. Britain should expect increased flows of illegal migration.\nMeanwhile, the shift to net zero also provides genuine opportunities, with the net zero economy growing three times faster than the overall economy last year.\nThe Conservatives can provide a distinctive centre-right alternative to Ed Miliband’s big state, big spending approach to net zero. We can offer pragmatic policies which work with the grain of the way people live their lives; which deploy the incentives, market mechanisms, and technological advances that are at the heart of a centre-right outlook. For example, rather than Labour’s anti-driver ideology, punishing those who need a car or van to get around, we should seek innovative ways to reduce the cost of ultra-low emission vehicles, supporting people to make greener choices.\nKemi was right to highlight concerns about high energy costs, but we don’t need to abandon our commitment to net zero to tackle this. In the longer term, renewables will deliver lower prices than fossil fuels controlled by petro-states and dictators. For more immediate help keeping prices down, green levies inherited from the Blair era could be reduced. Market-based incremental reforms to remove distortions and expose generators to more revenue risk could be made to modernise the ‘contracts for difference’ system. There is also a case for carefully thought through changes to the marginal pricing mechanism which currently means high gas prices often dictate the cost of other forms of energy in the UK.\nPolls repeatedly show support for green policies. Whatever might be the case across the Atlantic, there remains in this country a strong backing for action to protect nature and the climate. Moreover, our approach to environmental questions often influences how people view the Conservatives – a litmus test to judge us and our credibility. An ambitious green offer could provide an important means to reconnect with the so-called ‘Boden belt’ voters lost to Labour and the Lib Dems.\nMaking policies to safeguard our natural environment a prominent part our work to renew our party would help put us back on the path to power.\"",

  "http_www_theresavilliers_co_uk_/http_www_theresavilliers_co_uk_news_save-green-belt-barnet/content_15.html": "Theresa Villiers, Barnet resident and former MP, has submitted strong objections to the consultation on proposed changes to planning rules to allow development on the green belt. That consultation has been running since July and closes today.\nA long-time campaigner to protect the green belt, Theresa said “Labour’s plan to allow housing to be built on land placed a new ‘grey belt’ category will drastically weaken rules which protect the green belt.”\n“Green belt principles have safeguarded open spaces around our major towns and cities for decades. If these are weakened in the way proposed in the Government’s consultation, then outer suburbs like Barnet will be profoundly changed. They will no longer be places where the countryside meets the city and will become simply part of ever expanding urban sprawl.”\n“Labour’s plan will also encourage landowners to run down their land and make it derelict and unsightly in the hope that this leads to be it being judged to be ‘grey belt’.”\n“And it’s not just housing that Labour want to build on green belt land. They are also proposing that commercial premises and traveller sites could be constructed over our precious green spaces.”\n“This is a major threat to our local environment in Barnet. I encourage people to send in objections to the consultation to make their voice heard. The deadline is today for making your views heard and playing your part in saving the green belt.”\nAs well as eroding green belt protection, the proposed changes to the National Planning Policy Framework will dismantle reforms put in place by Michael Gove last December to give local councils more control over the targets they set for house building and ensure homes do not have to be built at densities which are excessive and out of character with the surrounding neighbourhood. Theresa was one of the back bench MPs that secured those Gove reforms to safeguard local decision-making in planning.\nThe consultation can be found here and responses can be emailed to [email protected].\nThis is an extract from Theresa’s objection:\n“I am strongly against the plans in the consultation document to weaken protection for the green belt. These safeguards have provided vital protection of the open spaces around our major towns and cities for decades.\nWithout the green belt, we would have seen unrestricted urban sprawl, with London stretching out and swallowing up what are now distinctive communities across the south and east of England.\nSuburban areas on the edge of London (such as Barnet) will be permanently damaged if the green belt is eroded. They would no longer be outer suburbs, on the edge of the countryside. Instead they will become ever more urbanised with little to distinguish them from inner London boroughs.\nGreen belt rules provide crucial protection for agricultural land and for nature and conservation. The focus in the consultation on building on so-called “poor quality” land ignores the fact that sites may provide important sanctuaries for nature and wildlife even if they have been previously developed or look rundown rather than picturesque. The purpose of the green belt was always much broader than protection of scenically pleasing areas.\nAllowing green belt development would harm the ability to deliver meaningful Nature Recovery Strategies, as required by the Environment Act. Green belt land, whether previously developed or not, plays a crucial part in wildlife corridors, linking habitats. The goal of the Government should be to enhance that, not undermine it.\nMoreover, if sites deemed to be ‘poor quality’ are excluded from green belt protection, that provides an incentive for landowners to cause disruption, damage and flytipping in order to make their land look unattractive, with the aim of getting it released for development. This is already a problem, and the proposals in this consultation would make it far worse. A fundamental flaw in the Government’s approach is that it would incentivise and reward bad behaviour, by encouraging the degrading of open spaces valued by communities.”\nOn the Labour plan to reverse the December 2023 reforms, Theresa's objection states:\n\"The proposal to reverse the reforms introduced by Michael Gove is wrong. Mr Gove’s changes to the NPPF gave planning authorities additional flexibility to depart from centrally set housing targets. They did not abolish targets but they gave locally elected councils a greater say over target-setting and the weight to be given to targets. They gave stronger protection for the green belt. And they made it clear that significant uplifts in density did not need to be applied where this would conflict with the suburban or rural character of the neighbourhood.\nThese changes delivered a more balanced planning system, safeguarding local democratically accountable decision-making, whilst also providing clear incentives for councils to get a valid plan in place. I believe that providing that incentive is the best way to deliver more homes. Experience with neighbourhood planning shows that if local communities are involved and empowered in the planning process, they can be ambitious in the number of new homes they deliver.\nThe increased targets which are proposed in the consultation would be impossible to meet without extensive high density high rise development in areas such as Barnet for which such buildings are entirely unsuited. These new targets should not be pursued. Going ahead with them risks urbanising the suburbs and creating poor quality tower block homes.\nThe better approach is to concentrate dense development in the urban centres of our big cities, as set out by Michael Gove in his speech on 24th July 2023: “Our ambition in London is a Docklands 2.0 – an eastward extension along the Thames of the original Heseltine vision. Taking in the regeneration of Charlton Riverside and Thamesmead in the south, and the area around Beckton and Silvertown to the north.”\nDigital imprint: Promoted by Theresa Villiers of 163 High Street, Barnet, EN5 5SU.",
  "http_www_theresavilliers_co_uk_/http_www_theresavilliers_co_uk_news_reflections-influence-academics-public-policy/content_12.html": "This week, Theresa Villiers joined a Martlets's Society discussion in University College, Oxford, to consider how academics can maximise their influence on public policy-making. She was speaking alongside Professor Gideon Henderson who is Chief Scientific Adviser at the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. Theresa's contribution to the discussion drew on some of her experiences as former Secretary of State and her introduction to the discussion covered the following:\n\"The linkage between great science and research and economic success are becoming clearer and clearer in the modern era.\nPerhaps the most extreme example of this is Stanford which has helped create companies whose combined value now runs into trillions of dollars. bigger than the GDP of a medium-sized western economy.\nIn the UK, we’re lucky enough to be home to some of the best universities in the world.\nThey are truly our some of our greatest economic and cultural assets.\nThat includes this University of Oxford which has been responsible for around 900 years of scholarship.\nIn that time it has made a massive contribution to human progress, from Hobbs and Locke on philosophy, to Dorothy Hodgkin on DNA.\nMost recently, the development of the Oxford vaccine in record time is estimated to have saved six million lives.\nIn my stints around the Cabinet table, universities were regularly on the agenda, and how we maximise the economic and regeneration potential our higher education institutions offer.\nMuch public attention is currently focused on AI, and academic input will be crucial as we grapple with the issues thrown up by this technology which will change our world in ways we cannot yet comprehend.\nBut we need academic insight across the policy spectrum. And I believe that it is highly influential.\nThat was at its most obvious during the pandemic. That crisis is being examined at length in the public enquiry, and no doubt there will be many lessons to be learned, including on the way in which Ministers acted on the scientific advice they were given. But there can be no doubt of the centrality of scientists to the Government’s pandemic response.\nClimate change provides another example of scientific experts having secured a fundamental change of approach across the whole political system.\nThat stretches from the scientists who persuaded Mrs Thatcher to highlight this issue back in the 1980s, to the 2006 Stern Review which had a worldwide impact in bringing home to people the financial cost of global warming.\nThe more recent review of the “Economics of Biodiversity” by Professor Partha Dasgupta may ultimately have an equivalent role on the debate on nature depletion by illustrating how critically dependent our prosperity is on our relationship with the natural world. I’d also highlight the exemplary work of Deiter Helm and the Natural Capital Committee.\nBoth of these initiatives have been crucial to securing the ground-breaking government commitment to end species decline by 2030.\nAnother area where academic research has really opened the eyes of Ministers and policy-makers is early years development.\nJust one of many influential studies was the EPPSE project led by Iram Siraj and Brenda Taggart at the Institute of Education. The Effective Pre-School, Primary and Secondary Education project produced convincing evidence that high-quality early education results in better cognitive and social outcomes, particularly for children from disadvantaged backgrounds.\nThe effects of early years care and education were shown to persist into secondary school, improving academic performance and reducing later-life inequality.\nThe research provided solid evidence that early intervention can reduce social inequality and improve life chances. I’d also commend the work of Oxford’s Professor Jane Barlow on the role early years parenting can play in mental health issues and evaluating ways to improve parenting practices in the pregnancy and post-natal period.\nStarting with Tony Blair this area of academic research has had a major impact on the policy of every Government of the 21st century.\nCrucially, it was used to make a convincing case to the Treasury that investment in early years education would generate tangible benefits and by reducing the incidence of costly social problems, such as substance abuse, anti-social behaviour, and crime.\nThat illustrates a key function of academic research in relation to government policy - to provide an evidence base for devoting resources to projects which will only pay back in the longer term and in ways which might not be obvious to Treasury officials.\nAnother important role for academic research in the public policy sphere is to ensure that governments properly manage risks which have very severe consequences. But which aren’t perceived as urgent …and hence can be crowded out by the hubbub of the 24 hour news cycle and whatever crisis a Minister happens to be facing that day.\nThe risks associated with zoonotic novel coronaviruses were a fairly obscure topic which wasn’t exactly at the top of the paperwork in Ministerial red boxes, until people started getting ill and the world economy rapidly began to shut down.\nThere is a important role for scientists in making governments pay proper attention to such risks.\nA further example is anti-microbial resistance. The increasing number of bacterial infections which are resistant to antibiotic treatment is something we’ve known about for many years. But it was during the years of the Coalition Government that the problem shot up the government’s agenda.\nI recall from my time in his government that David Cameron took a personal interest in this topic. He was determined to take action, and he set up the O’Neill Review in 2014 to work out the best way forward. He also ensured that the UK raised it in global health fora and pressed for the international action that is vital. This helped secure the Global Action Plan on AMR published in 2015.\nAnd I don’t believe that would have happened if Dame Sally Davies hadn’t been utterly determined to ensure Ministers gripped this problem.\nShe did that firstly by establishing a rigorous science base, and then by putting the case to Ministers in a way which was convincing and impossible to disregard. Jeremy Hunt told me that she was able to win over successive health secretaries with a combination of being both forthright and loyal.\nHer book “The Drugs Don’t Work” coupled with her hard-hitting pithy soundbites really hit home.\nThat included pointing out that drug-resistant superbugs were already killing thousands around the world; that if we did not act, we could see a return to the era in which 40% of the population die for prematurely from infections we cannot treat; that minor operations and childbirth could routinely lead to death.\nIn short, AMR could involve “the end of modern medicine” and trigger a “post-anti-biotic apocalypse”.\nClearly not every policy area lends itself to such dramatic assertions (thankfully!).\nBut a key task for any academic wanting to make their voice heard (and one Dame Sally did so well) is to translate their knowledge and research into a form that a non-expert can understand.\nOf course It’s not always possible to boil complex science down to simple concepts. But inevitably, the less accessible your material is, the harder it will be to persuade people to act on it.\nI believe that the machinery of government in the UK does take academic/scientific input very seriously. For example our system of Chief Scientific Advisers provides vital expertise to Ministers and civil servants. It is also a great channel of communication to enable scientists to connect with policy-makers. Our scientists are amongst the best in the world and it’s important that we enable their perspective to be heard loud and clear in Whitehall.\"\nThe Martlets' Society has existed for several decades in Oxford and regularly hosts discussions of literary works and other academic topics.

In her speech she said:\n\"Thank you for inviting me to this important gathering as we approach International Women’s Day.\nI would like to put on record my thanks for the support I received from the British Iranian community during my 19 years in the UK Parliament. I am hugely grateful to all of my Iranian friends. They inspired me to speak out on Iran many times. And I share their anger about the crimes of the Iranian regime and the tyranny it imposes.\nAs we celebrate International Women’s Day …we must not forget that there are still countries where women are treated as second class citizens.\nIt is disgraceful that women in Iran are denied so many basic rights …rights relating to marriage, divorce, child custody, employment, inheritance, political office - the list is a long one.\nIt’s appalling that punishments for domestic violence are wholly inadequate.\nAnd it’s utterly repellant that the legal age of marriage for girls is 13, and that men can obtain judicial permission to force their daughters into marriage at an even younger age than that.\nIn the UK we’ve realized in recent years that there is much more that we need to do to ensure women’s rights are fully respected, and International Women’s Day has become a time to acknowledge that.\nThe demand for more effective ways to combat male violence against women and girls has become louder and louder in Britain recent years. Our new understanding and awareness that the battle for true equality of opportunity is not yet won even in our own country should make us more outraged than ever before about the plight of women in Iran.\nWe should view with horror the situation that women face there.\nNot only are they subject to bullying and arrest if they defy the laws on Islamic dress, some never re-emerge from custody. That of course was the tragic fate of Mahsa Amini whose death at the hands of the so-called Morality Police provoked such massive protests.\nI want to pay tribute to all the brave women who took part in those protests and who continue to defy the regime and call for a free and democratic future for Iran. They have my support.\n“Women, life, freedom” was their rallying cry, and it was met by a brutal crackdown by the Mullahs.\nThe whole human rights situation in Iran is intolerable. As reported by Amnesty, people continue to be subjected to enforced disappearances, torture, and other cruel treatment.\nThe death penalty is used as a tool of political control and oppression. The BBC have reported that over 900 people were executed in 2024.\nAnd systemic immunity prevails for ongoing and past crimes against humanity. The perpetrators of the mass killings of 1988 have never been held to account. Some even hold high office.\nThis is an insult to the memory of those who lost their lives, and to the families bereaved by this horror. It is an outrage that these terrible crimes have gone unpunished for so long.\nBut let us not despair. Let us remember that Tehran’s allies and proxies have been heavily defeated on the battlefield. These evil men cannot prevail forever. They are on the wrong side of history.\nI truly believe that one day the goals of the “Women Life Freedom” movement will be fulfilled. One day we will see an independent judiciary and the rule of law. We will see the transition to free and fair elections. And we will see justice and equality for women.\nThese crucial aspirations are set out in the NCRI’s Ten Point Plan for a democratic, secular, non-nuclear Iran.\nSo let us once again give a big cheer for the brave dissidents and protesters who have kept the flame of hope and freedom alive in Iran, and for everyone working for a free and democratic future for the Iranian people.\"\nTheresa was part of a UK delegation led by Baroness O'Loan, and which also included former MPs, Anna Firth and Helen Goodman.",
  "http_www_theresavilliers_co_uk_/http_www_theresavilliers_co_uk_about-theresa/content_18.html": "Theresa lives in Arkley in Barnet. She grew up in St John’s Wood before studying at the University of Bristol, where she achieved a first in law and was ranked second in her year. She went on to Oxford, where she attained a BCL graduate degree. A former barrister, she was a lecturer at King’s College London when the London Conservatives chose her to top the list of their candidates for the European Election in 1999.\nRepresenting the capital for six years as an MEP, Theresa was Deputy Leader of the Conservatives in the European Parliament from 2001 to 2002. Throughout her time in the European Parliament Theresa was an opponent of Britain’s entry into the Euro and other attempts to expand the powers of the EU. She was also responsible for steering the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MIFID) through the European Parliament and was a leading figure in efforts to increase cross border trade in financial services.\nBetween 2005 and 2024, Theresa served in the House of Commons as MP for Chipping Barnet. In December 2005, after just seven months in parliament, David Cameron appointed Theresa to his Shadow Cabinet as Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury. As well as working with George Osborne on Conservative economic policy, Theresa led the Opposition scrutiny of the Finance Bills in 2006 and 2007 – this process is a notoriously complex and difficult task but Theresa gained vital concessions from Gordon Brown who was then the Chancellor. At David Cameron’s first reshuffle in July 2007, she gained further promotion and was appointed Shadow Secretary of State for Transport.\nWhen the Coalition took office on May 2010, Theresa was appointed to the Privy Council and became Minister of State for Transport. Her role included overseeing the transport needed to support the hugely successful London 2012 Olympics and helping to secure the funding for major investment in our railways, including upgrades to the London Underground network.\nTheresa was appointed to the Cabinet as Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in September 2012, a role she held until July 2016. She was only the 35th woman ever appointed to the UK Cabinet. In her role as Northern Ireland Secretary, she was responsible for delivering the successful G8 summit which took place in County Fermanagh in June 2013. That meeting delivered an international agreement aimed at ensuring that big multinational businesses pay their fair share of tax.\nIn 2014 Theresa chaired 11 weeks of cross party talks in Belfast resulting in the Stormont House Agreement which set out a way forward on resolving a number of crucial issues threatening the stability of the political settlement in Northern Ireland. After problems with implementation, Theresa stepped in again, chairing a further 10 weeks of talks in 2015 which delivered the Fresh Start Agreement. Without a successful conclusion to these talks, it is highly likely that Northern Ireland's devolved institutions would have collapsed.\nTheresa was part of the campaign to leave the EU and in 2019, she was one of just 27 Eurosceptic Conservative MPs to vote against Theresa May's EU Withdrawal Agreement three times because it would have kept the UK indefinitely subject to EU rules without any say over them.\nFrom 2019 to 2020, Theresa served in Boris Johnson's first Cabinet as Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, presenting ground-breaking legislation to Parliament. That included an Environment Bill to set demanding new targets on cleaning up air quality and protecting nature and biodiversity, as well as legislation on farming and fishing enable the UK to leave the EU's CAP and CFP and replace those programmes with a better greener alternative. She also announced plans to end the export of live animals for slaughter.\nTheresa was re-elected four times as Barnet's MP, in 2010, 2015, 2017 and 2019. Throughout her 19 years representing Chipping Barnet, she kept up busy schedule of campaigning and engagements in her constituency. Some of her key local campaigns included:\n- Securing upgraded facilities for Barnet Market and supporting our local high streets.\n- Delivering local neighbourhood police teams for every ward in Chipping Barnet (2005) and then getting them expanded.\n- Re-opening the health centres in Brunswick Park and East Barnet (2013 and 2015 respectively).\n- Expanding maternity and A&E services at Barnet Hospital (2015), and securing a major rebuild of Chase Farm Hospital (2019).\n- Saved Barnet Council breastfeeding support services from closure (2018).\n- Saving East Barnet Post Office from the closure.\n- Pressing BT to deliver high speed broadband to more homes in the constituency, and pushing them to fill gaps in provision.\n- Campaigned against antisemitism and in support of Israel and its right to defend itself.\n- Worked with the local Tamil community to highlight human rights abuses in Sri Lanka.\n- Supported efforts to find a just, lasting and balanced settlement to reunite Cyprus.\n- Backed the creation of the first ever Greek Orthodox secondary school, and the first cross-community Jewish secondary school (opened in 2013 and 2011 respectively). Supported local secondary schools to become academies, such as the Totteridge Academy.\n- Worked with local residents to prevent the building of an Asda superstore in New Barnet to save the site for new family homes (2015).\n- Defeating plans to build a waste disposal centre at Pinkham Way.\n- Stopped a cemetery being built on the green belt at Arkley (2016) and preventing a caravan park from being constructed over a field in Mays Lane (2024).\n- Strongly opposed overdevelopment, particularly where it impacts on the green belt, back gardens or other green spaces, such as Whalebones, Cat Hill in Cockfosters, and Hemington Avenue in Friern Barnet. She also fought for many years against new high rise blocks of flats at North London Business Park and the redevelopment of Barnet House.\n- Persuaded the then Transport Secretary, Grant Shapps, to veto plans by the Mayor of London to build over Cockfosters station car park. She also led a successful campaign to stop the Mayor from building over High Barnet station car park.\n- Whilst Transport Minister, secured funding for the tube upgrade, improving reliability and frequency on the Northern Line (2010). Stopped plans to split the Northern Line which would deny Barnet residents direct access to the Charing Cross branch.\n- Secured a further expansion of Barnet Hospital A&E (due to open by the end of 2024); and a significant increase in the number of GP appointments in our area.\n- Campaigned strongly against the Mayor of London’s plans to sell off Barnet police station.\n- Persuaded the previous Conservative Government to deliver 20,000 additional police, meaning the Met has more officers than ever before (2024).\n- Successfully lobbied for additional funding to protect the Jewish community (2023).\n- Part of the successful cross-party campaign to get 84B bus route from Potters Bar to Barnet restored (2023). Persuaded TfL to step in and save the 107 bus when Herts CC withdrew funding (2016).\n- Pushed GTR to restore peak time rail services at Oakleigh Park and New Southgate stations (2019).\n- Helped obtain a £6.6 billion rescue package for Transport for London after the Covid emergency (2022).\n- Secured £368,000 potholes funding for Barnet out of the money released from cancelling the northern leg of HS2 (2024). London had been denied a share of previous pothole money.\n- Campaigned successfully for more money for Barnet schools. Led a successful five year cross-party campaign to save maintained nursery schools threatened with closure. Lobbied for new buildings and facilities for local schools such as Alma Primary, East Barnet and Cromer Road.\n- Lobbied the Chancellor successfully for an expansion of free childcare (2023).\n- Twice persuaded the Chancellor to introduce business rate reductions for high street businesses.\n- Defeated plans by Barnet’s Labour council to impose new bus lanes in Cat Hill in East Barnet and on the A1000 in Whetstone High Road (2024).\n- Campaigned vigorously against other anti-driver measures such as Ulez expansion in the suburbs.",
  "http_www_theresavilliers_co_uk_/http_www_theresavilliers_co_uk_news_making-fresh-and-optimistic-case-northern-ireland-staying-uk-family-nations/content_3.html": "This speech by former Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Theresa Villiers was given in Belfast on 4th April at an event hosted for the business community by Together UK which is a group working to increase participation in the democratic process:\n“It is great to see business leaders coming together who share an ambition to see society progress through engagement, trade, and active participation in democracy.\nToday I want to reflect on how we might reframe the debate on the Union; so we give greater emphasis to the positive case for staying, and focus less on negative arguments. And I really welcome Together UK’s contribution to that important task.\nI appreciate that views from London aren’t always seen as helpful. But I hope the nearly four years I spent as Secretary of State has given me sufficient understanding of Northern Ireland to make it worthwhile for me to offer some thoughts on this.\nI want to be clear that I do not see that a referendum is likely to happen any time soon and it is also clear that the preconditions set out in the Belfast Good Friday Agreement, which require such a poll, are not met. But we need to make a case for the Union on a continuous basis, to maintain the strong public support there currently is for it.\nAs we all know, political debates in general, and referendums in particular, tend often to focus on negative issues. I have the highest regard for Northern Ireland’s elected leaders, but I have to say they are not always very cheerful in their outlook.\nIn emphasising positive themes, I do not wish to give the impression that I’m naïve about the real problems people face here: with the economy, with poverty, with public services, with NHS delays etc.\nBut the presence of these very real challenges should not mean there is no space for starting a different kind of discourse on the Union - a fresh approach to help us persuade those who are undecided or open-minded, help us persuade young people, help us persuade minority communities who may not identify with either of Northern Ireland’s two longstanding cultural traditions.\nIf there were to be a border poll, these swing voters would be crucial. To win we will need to persuade these groups that Northern Ireland is a success: that it is a great place to live; a great place to bring up a family; a great place to do business.\nLet’s take the last point. I appreciate that this is a tough time for businesses right across the UK, with the increase in Employer National Insurance, and the uncertainty caused by incoming US tariffs. I also accept that whilst the Windsor Framework may have mitigated the problems caused by the EU Protocol, frictions and costs remain.\nBut the economic benefits Northern Ireland has to offer to inward investors are immense. These include competitive costs; a highly educated and skilled workforce, particularly in areas such as fintech, cyber security and advanced manufacturing where NI is truly world leading; successful universities with a strong focus on research and skills needed by businesses; a stable and trusted legal system; taxes which, while higher than we would like, are still competitive compared to many jurisdictions.\nAnd of course a key attraction for overseas companies is the quality of life which Northern Ireland can offer their workers.\nIts housing is considerably more affordable than much of the rest of the UK, with access to the property ladder a viable prospect for a far greater proportion of the population. NI’s great schools deliver excellent results year after year. The country is home to some of the most beautiful landscapes in the world.\nIt has a rich cultural heritage from C S Lewis and Seamus Heaney to Van Morrison and Two Door Cinema Club. Its arts, music and culture scene is flourishing, with great galleries, museums and theatres. Its success in the film and TV industry has enabled millions of people around the world to glimpse its iconic scenery, not least through the world’s most successful television series, “Game of Thrones”.\nNorthern Ireland is most definitely not a cultural or economic backwater. It has so much to offer.\nAnd for all its challenges, the NHS as one of the UK’s greatest assets. I fully appreciate the frustration felt about waiting times, but the security of knowing that the NHS is there for you, free at the point of need, is something few countries can equal. In the event of a united Ireland, it’s hard to see how people Northern Ireland would escape the charges which routinely apply to health care south of the border.\nAnd while the Republic of Ireland has enjoyed real economic success over recent years, it also experienced the deeply painful Eurozone crash. It is not immune from vicissitudes of the global economic cycle. Significant numbers of families there experience hardship and cost of living problems. Housing affordability is clearly a very big issue. Put simply, there’s no economic nirvana in the south.\nBut perhaps the most important argument to win concerns community and society in Northern Ireland. Sadly there are still sectarian divisions, but a core part of the positive case for the union is to remind people of how far Northern Ireland has come.\nThe achievement of a durable and lasting settlement that has enabled people who were once deadly enemies to co-exist and work peacefully together for the good of the whole community is a genuinely inspirational story. It is a beacon for divided places around the world, giving them hope that they too can aspire to a better future, that workable compromises can be found, even where there are deeply entrenched views on different sides.\nThe fact that the devolved institutions have been out of action for much of the past few years has of course caused understandable exasperation. But we have seen a continued determination by elected leaders to find a way back.\nAnd it is a sign that the foundations of these institutions are becoming more firmly rooted that not only is the Executive up and running again, but the election of a Sinn Fein First Minister has passed off without triggering major controversy.\nThe Belfast Agreement is a success. It has created a political system which, for all its stops and starts, genuinely works, despite political divisions which date back centuries.\nThe question to put to undecided voters is why throw that all up in the air? When stability was so hard won, why vote for constitutional upheaval with all the uncertainty we know that involves? The endless rows, the entry negotiations with Dublin, the exit negotiations with London, the crunch votes, the absorption of the whole political system on this issue to the exclusion of everything else, probably for years and years and years.\nNo one can deny that there have been many painful episodes in the history of the relationship between Britain and Ireland, but our 21st century United Kingdom is a modern, inclusive, compassionate democracy which cherishes all its different nations, traditions and identities.\nIt is a truly successful political partnership, one which gives Northern Ireland the freedom to make its own decisions within the most wide-ranging devolution settlement in the country. But at the same time ensures the weight of the UK economy as a whole is there to act as a safety net when the global headwinds hit, as they did with the banking crash, Covid, and the Ukraine war energy price shock.\nIn conclusion, support for Northern Ireland’s place in the union continues to be strong, but referendum outcomes can be swayed in a way no one expects, and for reasons no one anticipated. So it’s more important than ever before that we put the case for UK unity a in a way which is modern, appealing, and optimistic.\"",
