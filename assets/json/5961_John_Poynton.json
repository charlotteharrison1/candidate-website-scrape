Nigel Farage has committed £3bn of this to the NHS, which leaves plenty for other things, including tax cuts. He has also reiterated that we want a publicly owned, publicly funded and in-house managed NHS. I fully endorse both of those statements.\nHowever I want to take a longer term look at the options available with a view to attaining the highest standards of health care in this country, free at the point of delivery for all, whilst at the same time reducing the burden on the taxpayer. UKIP stands for small government and low taxation, so any improvements in management and funding efficiency are a step in the right direction. I shall address issues to do with the way we manage our public services in a future article. In this article I shall concentrate on funding.\nThe main efficiency problem with all our public services is that they are monopolies. No monopoly has any incentive to be efficient unless it is underfunded, in which case shortages develop. These can take the form of prolonged waiting times, hasty attention or, in our schools, large class sizes. You can only achieve both sufficiency and efficiency at the same time in an open competitive market. That is an economic truism. A quick look at supermarkets will illustrate what I mean. Whilst not everyone likes the impersonal nature of supermarkets, I don’t think many will dispute their high standards or value for money. When you go to a supermarket you don’t have to make an appointment, book or stand in a queue (except at the checkout perhaps); you can drive straight in and park, find what you want already waiting for you on the shelves, and on the odd occasion where this is not so you can drive a few miles down the road to another one where it will be.\nIt is important to understand that such a situation would drive a Treasury mandarin mad, because of course in the public sector he would regard it as over-provision and thus a waste of taxpayers’ money. Competition only really kicks in when supply exceeds demand, because that is when customers truly have a choice. It’s no good trying to reproduce this in the public sector because you could never produce a wide enough range of customer choice. In the private sector, when a new product market develops, such as for mobile phones for example, the first supplier into that market makes huge profits. However those profits attract other entrants until the level of supply rises to and overtakes the level of demand. From then on weaker suppliers are likely to find the going much tougher and may not survive.\nPrivatisation only works where whole new marketplaces are created, involving multiple suppliers and multiple customers all interacting with each other. That is what happened with the public utilities in the 1980’s with huge improvements in efficiency, as anyone who can remember previously having to wait weeks for a new phone line from the old GPO can confirm. Whereas if you try to outsource a service from a monopoly you will just end up with an outsourced monopoly, which will be as tempted to profiteer as any other monopoly. Just look at what happened to the court interpreters for example. The Ministry of Justice outsourced the provision of interpreters to a single private agency, presumably thinking that the cheap price they achieved was a reflection of their purchasing power. In practice the new agency simply reduced the fees it paid to the interpreters, until eventually the interpreters decided it was no longer worth the candle and simply stopped working. As a result the supply of interpreters dried up and the courts were left in chaos. Much the same sort of thing happened with security at the Olympic Games, where eventually the Army had to step in to fill the gap.\nOutsourcing is used effectively in the private sector, as for example where a company outsources its IT department, but this only works because the person purchasing the service is also the person receiving it. They can then see immediately if quality of service is failing and react to it, ultimately if necessary by cancelling the contract for breach of its provisions. In the public sector this does not work because the person receiving the service, you and me, has no relationship with the person commissioning it. The feedback loop is entirely missing. Not only that, workers tend to have much greater loyalty and are much more likely to go the extra mile where they feel they are part of an organisation that people respect and need.\nSo where does this leave health, education, legal aid, care and support for the elderly, child care and a host of other such services? Are we doomed to having to put up with inefficient monopolies for ever?\nI don’t think so. An open competitive market inevitably will produce higher standards and better value for money, and people are often prepared to pay for that. You only have to look at the survival of independent schools to see it. The question is can we likewise encourage the private sector to compete and grow alongside public services such as the NHS without directly impinging on them, but do so in a way where the private sector alternative is also free at the point of delivery?\nFurther, can we do this so that the patient or other user can make an affordable choice, available to all without exception, between the sectors without requiring bureaucratic approval? The pitfalls were clearly demonstrated in the case recently of little Aisha King and his brain tumour, where his parents could only find the treatment he needed in the private sector. Yet it took a huge amount of political pushing and shoving to get the NHS to pay for it.\nI believe the answer to this is yes. I envisage the issue to everyone of a national credit card which can be used to pay for ‘public’ services from the private sector. The use of a credit card effectively makes the service free at the point of delivery. These services would be approved in principle, and suppliers would most likely most easily be accessible through a comparison website, which would check credentials and assess reputations on an ongoing basis. It would preferably act on a ‘blacklist’ basis so as to minimise barriers to entry, unlike the ‘whitelist’ approach, requiring expensive prequalification, favoured by New Labour and the European Union, which has quite the opposite effect and encourages profiteering.\nSo you slap all your purchases onto your credit card, without limit, and the government, as the credit card agency, pays them without question. However, come the end of the tax year, when hopefully you are back home fully recovered, the taxman will look at how much you have spent on your credit card, will do your tax assessment in the normal way, put the two together, apply a means test and then charge your affordable share of the cost back to you through the tax system, which for most people would mean an adjustment to their PAYE code. This is in fact just an adaptation of the old voucher system which has been mooted since the 1950’s, updated to use modern technology.\nSo everyone would pay something. Even people on benefits would pay a pound or two, because this is necessary to ensure a proper ‘value-for-money’ purchase decision. Benefits would be treated as income for the purposes of the means test and the charges deducted from future benefit payments as necessary. It is this decision which drives efficiency and quality, and prevents waste and over-usage. Past attempts at giving users choice have concentrated on quality only, which doesn’t work because you cannot all use the ‘best’ supplier! The system would not of course work for security and other establishment services as they have to be imposed rather than chosen.\nAlongside this I envisage the setting up of a dedicated wealth fund for the NHS and wider health service, perhaps to the tune of £30bn or so and perhaps called the National Health Fund (NHF), by issuing 30 year gilt-edged securities, currently costing less than 3% pa. The more astute of you will have noticed the heavy working capital requirement of the credit card system, but in addition to that the NHS itself and many hospitals within it are desperately in need of recapitalisation, there are new medical schools and nursing colleges to build and PFI contracts to buy out. I envisage investing about half this sum with a range of City asset managers so that over 30 years it is likely to produce a surplus sufficient to repay the loan in full and all the interest thereon, leaving the other half to spend.\nIt may take some time for confidence and supply to build up, and the means-test rates could start quite high initially to ensure an orderly introduction. This would encourage users to take out insurance against the retrospective charges, which means both that insurers cannot interfere in the treatment and that the premiums themselves are in effect means-tested. By about year fifteen the charges should be producing additional income well in excess of £10bn a year. As users migrate voluntarily across from the NHS its budget could be reduced, and not all of that money need be transferred to the fund since the fund will be receiving the charges via HMRC as well. The excess can be used to fund other public services and reduce taxes.\nI envisage that the NHF will be managed by the Department of Health subject to the restriction that any shortfall in the funds required for redemption must be made up progressively after year fifteen from the additional income. I also envisage that similar funds be set up for other public services such as education, care and support for the elderly, child care and legal aid. Once education is put onto the credit card system it would bring to an end finally the toxic social divide that still exists between state and independent schools. Although the most famous schools might decide not to accept the card, I am sure the majority of independent schools would do so as it would both secure the collection of fees and bring greater stability to the pupil population, since if a parent were to fall on hard times mid school career no one would know except the taxman. All parents no matter how poor could thence choose an independent school for their child if they so wished.\nThose on the left may be worried that this will produce a two-tier system, or that the profit motive will undermine quality of service and accessibility. I believe these worries are unfounded. A two-tier system is only a problem where demand exceeds supply, whereas the whole point of this system is that we get away from shortages and restrictions on access, promoting a free choice for all between the two sectors. Furthermore there is a difference between profiting (good) and profiteering (bad). Profit can only be made in an open competitive market if you satisfy your customers. Why does it matter if a supplier makes a profit if they are providing better value for money? Whereas profiteering occurs where supply is restricted. Indeed the Treasury is profiteering all the time by cutting expenditure which in turn undermines quality of service. It is time to bring that to an end.",
  "https_jepoynton_com_/https_jepoynton_com_2016_10_23_ukip-and-grammar-schools/content_39.html": "UKIP comes to the issue of grammar schools not from a position of ideology but from a belief in local democracy. In general where a decision can be made at a local level which will not adversely affect citizens living outside its boundaries then it should be. You don’t need uniformity across the land on such issues, which generally speaking are value-judgemental rather than technical. Let there be a multiplicity of choices and the comparison in outcomes will help to inform everyone. Other examples are fox hunting and the slaughter of halal meat. The geographical area will depend on how a community defines itself for the purpose, and can range from national (within the UK) to sub post-code. In addition we should perhaps think of allowing those outside such a boundary to challenge a decision in the courts if they think they themselves would be significantly adversely affected. If such an opt-out system had been in place in the EU then perhaps it might not have got itself into such a mess!\nThis however does not address the problem of the 11 plus. I myself failed my 11 plus all those years ago, yet went on to gain an honours degree in physics from Edinburgh University and to qualify as a Chartered Accountant with one of the big city firms. I am therefore among the foremost to say that you cannot judge a child’s potential at the age of eleven. Many otherwise bright children are at that age distracted by problems at home or other emotional issues which they then go on to solve or simply grow out of. I was lucky in having an independent school education, so it didn’t matter.\nBut the system was never designed to be like that. In theory you could move up to grammar school through the 13 plus or at O level or GCSE. The fact that this rarely happened was that the secondary modern schools were rubbish. They were not properly funded, managed or monitored, and made no effort to prepare the children for those exams. It need not be like that.\nI propose that where a county or other community chooses a two tier system, then the lower tier schools should be given larger budgets per child. Maybe as much as 10% or even more. It is much more challenging to teach a slower child than a bright one. The latter pretty much teach themselves once you point them in the right direction, whereas less able or distracted children need more discipline in smaller class sizes, more one-to-one support, more pastoral care, different teaching methods and above all teachers with a much greater spread and depth of ability. These things are expensive and must be provided.\nAh, you will say, so where is the money coming from? Here I refer you to my proposal for a National Credit Card which would enable any citizen to access essential services from the private sector on a means-tested basis if they so wish. Using this, I propose charging the parents of grammar school children a proportion, perhaps 50%, of the school’s actual budget for their child. As most such parents are quite well off this will bring in a substantial income whilst not penalising the poorer parents. It will also sharpen up some of our grammar schools which are not perhaps quite as sharp as they should be!\nOf course we must also guard against the type of mismanagement that occurred in the past. All state schools must be managed through a national schools agency along the lines set out in my earlier post entitled The Management of our Public Services.\nBright children will by and large end up on their feet one way or another. The less able children will not. They will end up as ‘NEET’s and a burden to both themselves and to society as a whole. It is worth making the effort to give them the attention they need through schools specially designed for the purpose, and better for them than comprehensives, for all our sakes.",
  "https_jepoynton_com_/https_jepoynton_com_2024_10_31_my-alternative-budget-speech-october-2024/content_27.html": "Mr. Speaker, it is an honour and a privilege for me to have this opportunity to present to the House the government’s budget for the coming year.\nAs the House will already know, our economy and government finances are in a desperate and sorry state. Over the past nearly 25 years we have suffered a series of setbacks that have enveloped us in a perfect storm, starting with our membership of the European Union Single Market which has seen our trade balance with those countries plummet from having been broadly in balance to a deficit at the time of the Brexit Referendum of £109 billion; that’s 6% of GDP at that time. This has presented British business with a contracting market. Generally speaking business will not invest into a contracting market, with the result that productivity growth has suffered.\nThen we had the banking crisis, triggered by an oil price spike in 2007 which led to the default of many sub-prime mortgages in the USA and which our banks had invested into. But there were also collapses on this side of the pond such as Northern Rock and HBOS which were simply due to over-trading, and that can only be due to a failure of regulation here. One bright spot then arises as the banks were quickly recapitalised through the use of quantitative easing, which did not on that occasion produce inflation as it was merely replacing credit which had been destroyed in the crisis. Unfortunately later on the QE was restarted with inevitable inflationary consequences.\nOn top of all that we had austerity and the failure to start a Sovereign Wealth Fund when interest rates hit the floor. Mr. Speaker, I am sure that most members are aware that 5% compounded will quadruple your money within 30 years, and 7% double it within ten. Over the past thirty years returns on many foreign shares have been far greater than the cost of government borrowing here. That is because the rate of growth in many other countries has been far faster than it has been here and is likely to continue that way for some time to come. It must make sense for us to benefit from their success in this way. A golden opportunity completely missed.\nThen we come to Brexit which some today are blaming for all our financial woes. Mr. Speaker, I do not accept that analysis but instead that the Trade and Co-operation Agreement has locked us into the catastrophic trade deficit we inherited from the Single Market. It is not enough to secure no tariffs in either direction when there are a host of other regulations creating the imbalance, and we need the use of tariffs to counter that effect. That will almost certainly mean scrapping the TCA, and whilst trade volumes may fall, the much greater effect of import substitution will present British business at home with the expanding market they crave to invest and create productivity growth and jobs.\nFollowing that we had Covid and the energy crisis caused by the war in Ukraine, thankfully temporarily as Russia has found other outlets into the international oil markets, and all of the panic over climate change. And if that weren’t enough mass immigration, quite apart from increasing cultural conflict within the country, has condemned wages to minimum levels, undermined working conditions and caused record levels of unemployment and homelessness. And to cap it all, we have an ageing population pushing the cost of pensions and health care through the roof. Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear!\nNow, Mr. Speaker, it is not my intention to spend time trying to apportion blame for this situation. Many of these circumstances were beyond our control, and for others it is easy to be wise after the event. My purpose is to identify the causes so we can take appropriate action to remedy them and to quantify the task itself. Our National Debt is now close to 100% of GDP after having been nearly paid off a quarter of a century ago, and the cost of interest on that debt is now over £100 billion a year, nearly 4% GDP in itself, and rising. The total fiscal deficit is around £170 billion and that is adding to the Debt all the time. It is imperative, Mr. Speaker, that we get our nose ahead of the game so that we can reverse the whole process.\nMy strategy is based on three key objectives necessary to provide a tripod of stability for our recovery. First I aim to achieve a fiscal surplus of 1% GDP within five years. Second I want a trade surplus of 1% GDP by that time, and third we must achieve net zero immigration as well. Add to that some essential tax cuts to motivate growth and expenditure increases to avoid imminent collapse of some public services and we are looking at an annual fiscal turnaround of £300 billion by the end of our first five years.\nOn average I must save £60 billion in each of the next five years, but that is only on average. There are couple of policies which can raise substantial funds in excess of this amount up front, while others such as revived economic growth will be weighted towards the end. The good news is that over the following five years those trends should lead to a much greater turnaround of around £450 billion or more, with much greater scope for both tax cuts and expenditure increases, which I shall aim broadly to keep equal. I shall also aim to cut the total level of taxation down to 30% GDP, whereas currently it is around 37%, all the while maintaining fiscal and trade surpluses of 1% GDP. History shows that all the economies with the highest rates of economic growth have run Balance of Payments surpluses and I am determined the UK should be in that group.\nSo, Mr. Speaker, let me make a start.\nMy first port of call is multinational corporations, which have long had a habit of shifting their profits into tax havens, or semi tax havens such as the Republic of Ireland, to avoid corporation tax in this country. Now I accept that at 25% our rate of corporation tax is too high, and I shall return to that later, but for now may I completely reject the argument that this country must somehow engage in a race to bottom just to remain competitive. There are other ways we can regulate our trade balance, and in any case if were able to collect what is morally due to us, profits made out purchases by the good citizens of this country, that would provide the funds to reduce it.\nOver ten years ago now, the G8 at its summit in Enniskillen tasked the OECD with ending this practice. They have completely failed to do so and show no signs of any significant progress as they just kick the can further on down the road. Clearly the multinationals have got to them! We cannot afford to wait any longer.\nThe good news is that this is very easy to rectify. Henceforth multinationals, which we shall define as any company that has more than 10% of its turnover in more than one country, shall be taxed on the basis of their global profits, as declared to their shareholders and in the public domain, and apportioned to this country by turnover, including non-domestic intercompany sales. They may be able to shift their head offices and their intellectual property rights, but they cannot shift their customers! It is difficult to forecast accurately without an established database exactly how much additional revenue this will raise, but our best estimates suggest it could be within the range of £40 to 50 billion if not more.\nSecond, Mr. Speaker, I am abolishing Inheritance Tax. It is a very inefficient tax, raising only about a third of 1% GDP; is double taxation in the hands of the deceased; uses up a disproportionate amount of tax legislation and consequently distracts the attention of thousands of lawyers and accountants who should be more constructively engaged.\nHowever I recognise that a society in which around 2% of the population own 80% of its assets is not a healthy one. I want to reduce this wealth gap but not eliminate it. It remains important that those with energy, ability and enterprise can profit from them for the benefit of us all. In practice however much of this accumulated wealth is passive asset appreciation.\nI therefore aim to raise about 2% GDP by charging legacies to capital gains tax in the hands of beneficiaries. This would require a 50% withholding tax to counter avoidance, but which would be repaid, with interest, when the gains are presented for assessment. I do not propose to introduce a wealth tax, which would also be double taxation in the hands of the taxpayer as well as very difficult to collect as much of it would disappear into overseas trusts and corporate structures.\nCapital gains will be assessed to income tax at the taxpayer’s marginal rate with no additional allowances. However I am allowing it to be spread over ten years so that poorer beneficiaries can use up more of their allowances and lower rate bands. This reflects the rule-of-thumb PE ratio of 10 often used to value small companies.\nExisting roll-over reliefs from inheritance tax such as for farms and businesses will be maintained and I am adding relief for the repayment of any student loans, not necessarily those of the taxpayer. Tax on occupied primary residences, again not necessarily by the taxpayer or his family, such as a sitting tenant, may be deferred until that occupant leaves.\nI am also abolishing Non-Dom status, but replacing it with a flat cap on income tax, including capital gains, of £250,000 in any one year.\nThese two changes alone should raise around £80 billion a year. I am not seeking to raise any other taxes. I am however reintroducing marginal relief from corporation tax for small businesses with a zero rate allowance of one million and a lower rate band of two million. The lower rate will be half the full rate which remains at 25%. In the longer term I aim to reduce taxation to 30% GDP and increase the personal tax allowance to match the typical minimum wage at £20,000, and reduce the top rate to 40%. I may also introduce an intermediate rate at 30%.\nMr. Speaker I now come to a series of changes focused on reducing the burden on the taxpayer without endangering essential public services by focusing on efficiency and alternative sources of finance.\nBetter late than never I am introducing a Sovereign Wealth Fund which will be funded by borrowing at an interest rate not greater than 5% and at an amount, if available in the gilts markets, of 1% GDP a year. The asset will offset the liability and therefore have no effect on net debt. This will be farmed out to multiple professional fund managers with after time the more successful attracting greater contributions.\nIn addition I am starting the funding of a new state pension. This necessarily must be a gradual and prolonged process which will not have any significant effect on the public finances for many years. It will be available only to those under the age of 25 on 6th April next year and will be optional. Modelling suggests it will primarily benefit those on above average salaries, thereby halving in due course the number in the existing state pension. This in turn may allow us to improve the existing state pension significantly. For those who opt in, the existing employee national insurance contribution of 8% becomes a national pension contribution and is placed in an account in their name to which a guaranteed 4% interest as added annually. Of the three parameters of contribution rate, retirement age and pension amount, they will have the flexibility to fix any two and get a quote for the third. They may opt in or change these parameters at a later date, subject to not reducing the pension to an annuity equivalent below the level that would trigger entitlement to pension credits, and their remaining entitlement to the existing state pension will be determined by the number of years’ contributions in the existing way. This will create a fully flexible and transferable pension scheme which is currently unavailable to many, including those who switch employment between the public and private sectors. The money will physically go into the Sovereign Wealth Fund, which should get a better return for carrying risk, and will be part of its 1% GDP per annum funding target.\nMr. Speaker I am also introducing a National Credit Card. The purpose of the card is to give all citizens access to the private sector for essential services such as health and education on a means-tested basis. Just taking the health and schools budgets alone costs the taxpayer around £250 billion a year. If 50% used the private sector instead, and the average means-tested support for fees was also 50%, then the saving to the taxpayer would be over £60 billion a year.\nWe shall have to introduce this gradually to enable the supply side to meet increasing demand and it will be optional. Users pay for services in the normal way but do not have to settle the card at the end of the month. Instead after the end of the year when the taxman assesses your tax he will also review how much you have spent on your card, put the two together and recharge your share of the cost to your tax bill for the following year. Working capital will come from the Sovereign Wealth Fund at 5% which will be added to your costs from the date of purchase, but users will be able to pay on account to avoid it. The means test rate will be a simple percentage set at the beginning of each fiscal year for each user set in due course to encourage 50% usage. Much of these savings will then be available to improve the state services, and the fact that the private sector is accessible to all will remove any stain of privilege that some attribute to it at present.\nMr. Speaker, with the help of my RH colleagues I am taking a number of measures to improve efficiency within our public services. First we shall be splitting the civil service clean in two so that the advisory side, which advises ministers on current problems and future legislation, becomes completely separate and independent from the executive side, which delivers services mandated by Parliament. Two completely separate functions requiring separate organisational structures. This way the advisory side can assist ministers in holding the executive side to account.\nSecond we shall be appointing a national chief executive with the power to hire and fire local chief executives for every national public service. It is an extraordinary fact that currently few if any of our public services actually have any top management at all. No wonder they are all running around like headless chickens being hopelessly inefficient.\nThese chief executives will be mandated to ensure that sufficient trained British staff are recruited into each service, that they are paid the rate for the job so that staff turnover rates are minimised, and that agency and support staff are reduced to less than 25% of payroll each. I am also allowing staff bonuses to be paid out of 10% of any local budget savings or collected charges.\nThird, I am abolishing national wage bargaining in the tax funded public sector. Henceforth all such staff will be paid a full inflationary increase on 1st April each year. I reject the argument that this will create an inflationary wage spiral on the grounds both that there are no prices in this sector and that inflation increases the tax base anyway. But it is also important for staffing stability that all staff are paid the rate for the job, which will vary by skill and location across the country with additional increases awarded locally and which therefore cannot be addressed on a national basis.\nThese measures taken together could save another £30 billion a year as well as ensure they are no longer dependent on immigration for staff.\nSpeaking of immigration, my RH friend the Home Secretary will be scrapping the current points-based system and replacing it with an auctioned reducing quota system so that total immigration is reduced to below emigration rates within five years. It is therefore vital that we are able to reduce unemployment at the same or faster rate. Indeed we currently have over 3% job vacancies across our economy which is roughly double historical norms and only serves to suck in yet more immigrants. I shall therefore be instructing the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee henceforth to use a composite 4% target when setting interest rates; that is 2% inflation plus 2% job vacancies. I anticipate this will mean interest rates will remain at around the 5% mark for the foreseeable future, which is necessary anyway to encourage savings and fund investment, and will also probably be needed to contain the inflationary impact of wage rises in a tighter labour market. I shall be addressing the housing market separately in a few moments.\nIn addition I have a new regional policy designed to reduce the regional pay and unemployment gaps. It must make sense to focus stimulation to where unemployment is highest post code by post code across the country leading eventually to an even level of percentage employment across the land. This will increase income tax revenues and reduce welfare claims so it is likely to be fiscally neutral in the longer term.\nTo do so I shall cease funding new free tax and enterprise zones, which have a very chequered and uneven history, and instead introduce discounts for income tax, business rates and employers national insurance where the discount is proportionate to the local level of unemployment. For the coming year this discount will be 5% for every 1% that unemployment, measured on the claimant basis, is above 5%. We will review this algorithm annually to ensure a steady reduction in the regional gap.\nI also have a number of measures to free up the labour market to reduce structural unemployment. First I am repealing all IR35 legislation, which was designed to prevent employers avoiding the cost of national insurance contributions on permanent staff, by the simple measure of charging the invoices of self-employed and agency staff to NICs also. Professional fees will be exempt. The increased revenues will be used to reduce employers NICs for all so that the measure is fiscally neutral.\nIn any case I am immediately reducing employers NICs to 12% and increasing the minimum wage and universal credits in line with the triple lock on the state pension. I am also introducing marginal relief for employers NI with a zero alowance of £1000 per week of payroll, and a lower band of £2000 at a rate of half the full rate.\nSecond my RH friend the Work and Pensions Secretary will be undertaking a full post-implementation review of the introduction of Universal Credits with a view to making it simpler and more streamlined and efficient. In particular he will ensure that the thresholds for and rates of clawback are also universal, and that once vetted claimants do not have to reapply every time they get a gap between jobs. This is particularly important for self-employed people who currently often decline short term or low paid assignments because of the hassle and delays in reapplying.\nWithin this context I am increasing the threshold, or earnings disregard, for clawback of universal credits to £50 per week. This will create a much greater incentive for unemployed people to make that first leap back into employment, and will also allow low paid workers in the taper to keep more of what they themselves have earned. This will both reduce the poverty trap and the pressure on food banks many of which are struggling to obtain sufficient supplies.\nMr. Speaker, I now turn to support for farmers and care homes. At first sight they do not have much in common but they are both essential to our wellbeing, are competitive within the private sector and yet need financial support if they are to produce both food and care at affordable levels and remain profitable. Furthermore farmers are in competition with foreign imports which are heavily subsidised.\nFor both industries I am introducing a public subsidy at 10% on turnover. This will be subject to a profit cap at 5% before tax to prevent profiteering by larger businesses at the expense of both taxpayer and customer. The subsidy is designed to promote sales, and the profit cap will encourage competitive pricing and support greater expenditure. Qualifying directors remuneration will be restricted. In future years the rate of subsidy will be adjusted so that no more than 5% of businesses liquidate each year.\nMany businesses in a variety of industries receive public subsidies and there has been much concern at their profits. I am therefore extending the profit cap to all entities in receipt of public subsidy, though the cap may vary according to their capital investment requirements. I am also extending it proportionately to all companies with contracts with the public sector worth annually over 10% of their turnover.\nFinally Mr. Speaker I come to the housing market. I shall be reducing house prices from now on by between 1 and 2% a year on average. This is easily done by giving the Bank of England that target and by tightening criteria such as mortgage to value and income to mortgage used by commercial lenders.\nNow you may at first sight think that would make it more difficult for prospective purchasers to find and buy a new house, but in fact that is not so. For one thing the number of available houses out there does not change, and for another the supply is likely to increase because sellers will hurry to sell before prices reduce further. More importantly developers will no longer be able to make capital gains on their land banks and so can only build houses on them and sell them. In monetary terms the reduction in demand will be matched by a reduction is prices until all available houses are sold.\nThe misconstrued Help to Buy policy has just made matters worse, so I am in effect reversing it. Last year fewer new houses were built than before the policy was introduced over ten years ago and it has just pushed house prices even higher. Irrespective of whether we can balance supply and demand, the amount of credit tied up in the housing market means that house prices are likely to remain high. Yet house prices must come down if younger people are to buy when they get married and start a family and others to escape the parental nest and develop as independent adults.\nCurrently it takes on average over five years to build out a granted planning consent whereas no so long ago it was only two. It has been reported that there are hundreds of thousands of such consents gathering dust in the pending trays of property developers because they can make more money from capital gains. But it is important to understand also that they have themselves been squeezed by increasing land prices. As a result they have endeavoured to recoup their margins by resorting to dodgy practices such as denying buyers adequate snagging periods and tying them up into leaseholds with uncontrollable ground rent increases, and generally cutting costs and building to very low standards. Many such properties are now unsaleable. Mr. Speaker I am giving Help to Buy purchasers a new six month snagging period, with a survey at taxpayer’s expense to ensure objectivity, and with all restitution costs at the sellers expense.\nMy RH friend the Secretary of State for Housing, will be carrying out a full review of planning and related procedures including the possible repeal of the 1961 Land Compensation Act which gives 100% of all planning gain to landowners. We believe it may be more appropriate to divide planning gain equally between landowners, a national development corporation with powers of compulsory purchase to focus new development in the North where there are plentiful brownfield sites available, supported by regional policy which will encourage both people and jobs to move there, and local development corporations who can use the money for local infrastructure thereby creating balanced communities. The South East is overcrowded and current development priorities just make that worse. They are levelling down not levelling up. We will protect and maintain the green belt.\nOn social housing I am restoring the full housing benefit which will become affordable again as immigration falls. This will allow housing associations access to the City for development finance, and I shall be adding a government guarantee to help reduce borrowing costs. We will continue to support Right to Buy as it does not reduce total housing available but I am halving the discounts.\nFollowing the Grenfell Tower Tragedy many leaseholders have become trapped with spiralling service charges which they cannot pay. I am therefore limiting service charge increases to inflation backdated to the date of the tragedy, and will refund landlords forced into loss by this, subject to reasonable limits on insurance premiums and other costs.\nIn summary Mr. Speaker I anticipate that for the coming year tax increases and expenditure savings with bring in around £80 billion and tax reductions and expenditure increases cost around £20 billion, giving my target net saving of £60 billion. I am also placing a five and ten year Source and Application of Funds Statement in the library and online. So now it just remains for me to I thank the House for their patience and attention during this speech. It is a budget for working people and small businesses combined with a strategy to save Britain, and I commend it to the House.",

  "https_jepoynton_com_/http_jepoynton_com/content_67.html": "Mr. Speaker, it is an honour and a privilege for me to have this opportunity to present to the House the government’s budget for the coming year.\nAs the House will already know, our economy and government finances are in a desperate and sorry state. Over the past nearly 25 years we have suffered a series of setbacks that have enveloped us in a perfect storm, starting with our membership of the European Union Single Market which has seen our trade balance with those countries plummet from having been broadly in balance to a deficit at the time of the Brexit Referendum of £109 billion; that’s 6% of GDP at that time. This has presented British business with a contracting market. Generally speaking business will not invest into a contracting market, with the result that productivity growth has suffered.\nThen we had the banking crisis, triggered by an oil price spike in 2007 which led to the default of many sub-prime mortgages in the USA and which our banks had invested into. But there were also collapses on this side of the pond such as Northern Rock and HBOS which were simply due to over-trading, and that can only be due to a failure of regulation here. One bright spot then arises as the banks were quickly recapitalised through the use of quantitative easing, which did not on that occasion produce inflation as it was merely replacing credit which had been destroyed in the crisis. Unfortunately later on the QE was restarted with inevitable inflationary consequences.\nOn top of all that we had austerity and the failure to start a Sovereign Wealth Fund when interest rates hit the floor. Mr. Speaker, I am sure that most members are aware that 5% compounded will quadruple your money within 30 years, and 7% double it within ten. Over the past thirty years returns on many foreign shares have been far greater than the cost of government borrowing here. That is because the rate of growth in many other countries has been far faster than it has been here and is likely to continue that way for some time to come. It must make sense for us to benefit from their success in this way. A golden opportunity completely missed.\nThen we come to Brexit which some today are blaming for all our financial woes. Mr. Speaker, I do not accept that analysis but instead that the Trade and Co-operation Agreement has locked us into the catastrophic trade deficit we inherited from the Single Market. It is not enough to secure no tariffs in either direction when there are a host of other regulations creating the imbalance, and we need the use of tariffs to counter that effect. That will almost certainly mean scrapping the TCA, and whilst trade volumes may fall, the much greater effect of import substitution will present British business at home with the expanding market they crave to invest and create productivity growth and jobs.\nFollowing that we had Covid and the energy crisis caused by the war in Ukraine, thankfully temporarily as Russia has found other outlets into the international oil markets, and all of the panic over climate change. And if that weren’t enough mass immigration, quite apart from increasing cultural conflict within the country, has condemned wages to minimum levels, undermined working conditions and caused record levels of unemployment and homelessness. And to cap it all, we have an ageing population pushing the cost of pensions and health care through the roof. Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear!\nNow, Mr. Speaker, it is not my intention to spend time trying to apportion blame for this situation. Many of these circumstances were beyond our control, and for others it is easy to be wise after the event. My purpose is to identify the causes so we can take appropriate action to remedy them and to quantify the task itself. Our National Debt is now close to 100% of GDP after having been nearly paid off a quarter of a century ago, and the cost of interest on that debt is now over £100 billion a year, nearly 4% GDP in itself, and rising. The total fiscal deficit is around £170 billion and that is adding to the Debt all the time. It is imperative, Mr. Speaker, that we get our nose ahead of the game so that we can reverse the whole process.\nMy strategy is based on three key objectives necessary to provide a tripod of stability for our recovery. First I aim to achieve a fiscal surplus of 1% GDP within five years. Second I want a trade surplus of 1% GDP by that time, and third we must achieve net zero immigration as well. Add to that some essential tax cuts to motivate growth and expenditure increases to avoid imminent collapse of some public services and we are looking at an annual fiscal turnaround of £300 billion by the end of our first five years.\nOn average I must save £60 billion in each of the next five years, but that is only on average. There are couple of policies which can raise substantial funds in excess of this amount up front, while others such as revived economic growth will be weighted towards the end. The good news is that over the following five years those trends should lead to a much greater turnaround of around £450 billion or more, with much greater scope for both tax cuts and expenditure increases, which I shall aim broadly to keep equal. I shall also aim to cut the total level of taxation down to 30% GDP, whereas currently it is around 37%, all the while maintaining fiscal and trade surpluses of 1% GDP. History shows that all the economies with the highest rates of economic growth have run Balance of Payments surpluses and I am determined the UK should be in that group.\nSo, Mr. Speaker, let me make a start.\nMy first port of call is multinational corporations, which have long had a habit of shifting their profits into tax havens, or semi tax havens such as the Republic of Ireland, to avoid corporation tax in this country. Now I accept that at 25% our rate of corporation tax is too high, and I shall return to that later, but for now may I completely reject the argument that this country must somehow engage in a race to bottom just to remain competitive. There are other ways we can regulate our trade balance, and in any case if were able to collect what is morally due to us, profits made out purchases by the good citizens of this country, that would provide the funds to reduce it.\nOver ten years ago now, the G8 at its summit in Enniskillen tasked the OECD with ending this practice. They have completely failed to do so and show no signs of any significant progress as they just kick the can further on down the road. Clearly the multinationals have got to them! We cannot afford to wait any longer.\nThe good news is that this is very easy to rectify. Henceforth multinationals, which we shall define as any company that has more than 10% of its turnover in more than one country, shall be taxed on the basis of their global profits, as declared to their shareholders and in the public domain, and apportioned to this country by turnover, including non-domestic intercompany sales. They may be able to shift their head offices and their intellectual property rights, but they cannot shift their customers! It is difficult to forecast accurately without an established database exactly how much additional revenue this will raise, but our best estimates suggest it could be within the range of £40 to 50 billion if not more.\nSecond, Mr. Speaker, I am abolishing Inheritance Tax. It is a very inefficient tax, raising only about a third of 1% GDP; is double taxation in the hands of the deceased; uses up a disproportionate amount of tax legislation and consequently distracts the attention of thousands of lawyers and accountants who should be more constructively engaged.\nHowever I recognise that a society in which around 2% of the population own 80% of its assets is not a healthy one. I want to reduce this wealth gap but not eliminate it. It remains important that those with energy, ability and enterprise can profit from them for the benefit of us all. In practice however much of this accumulated wealth is passive asset appreciation.\nI therefore aim to raise about 2% GDP by charging legacies to capital gains tax in the hands of beneficiaries. This would require a 50% withholding tax to counter avoidance, but which would be repaid, with interest, when the gains are presented for assessment. I do not propose to introduce a wealth tax, which would also be double taxation in the hands of the taxpayer as well as very difficult to collect as much of it would disappear into overseas trusts and corporate structures.\nCapital gains will be assessed to income tax at the taxpayer’s marginal rate with no additional allowances. However I am allowing it to be spread over ten years so that poorer beneficiaries can use up more of their allowances and lower rate bands. This reflects the rule-of-thumb PE ratio of 10 often used to value small companies.\nExisting roll-over reliefs from inheritance tax such as for farms and businesses will be maintained and I am adding relief for the repayment of any student loans, not necessarily those of the taxpayer. Tax on occupied primary residences, again not necessarily by the taxpayer or his family, such as a sitting tenant, may be deferred until that occupant leaves.\nI am also abolishing Non-Dom status, but replacing it with a flat cap on income tax, including capital gains, of £250,000 in any one year.\nThese two changes alone should raise around £80 billion a year. I am not seeking to raise any other taxes. I am however reintroducing marginal relief from corporation tax for small businesses with a zero rate allowance of one million and a lower rate band of two million. The lower rate will be half the full rate which remains at 25%. In the longer term I aim to reduce taxation to 30% GDP and increase the personal tax allowance to match the typical minimum wage at £20,000, and reduce the top rate to 40%. I may also introduce an intermediate rate at 30%.\nMr. Speaker I now come to a series of changes focused on reducing the burden on the taxpayer without endangering essential public services by focusing on efficiency and alternative sources of finance.\nBetter late than never I am introducing a Sovereign Wealth Fund which will be funded by borrowing at an interest rate not greater than 5% and at an amount, if available in the gilts markets, of 1% GDP a year. The asset will offset the liability and therefore have no effect on net debt. This will be farmed out to multiple professional fund managers with after time the more successful attracting greater contributions.\nIn addition I am starting the funding of a new state pension. This necessarily must be a gradual and prolonged process which will not have any significant effect on the public finances for many years. It will be available only to those under the age of 25 on 6th April next year and will be optional. Modelling suggests it will primarily benefit those on above average salaries, thereby halving in due course the number in the existing state pension. This in turn may allow us to improve the existing state pension significantly. For those who opt in, the existing employee national insurance contribution of 8% becomes a national pension contribution and is placed in an account in their name to which a guaranteed 4% interest as added annually. Of the three parameters of contribution rate, retirement age and pension amount, they will have the flexibility to fix any two and get a quote for the third. They may opt in or change these parameters at a later date, subject to not reducing the pension to an annuity equivalent below the level that would trigger entitlement to pension credits, and their remaining entitlement to the existing state pension will be determined by the number of years’ contributions in the existing way. This will create a fully flexible and transferable pension scheme which is currently unavailable to many, including those who switch employment between the public and private sectors. The money will physically go into the Sovereign Wealth Fund, which should get a better return for carrying risk, and will be part of its 1% GDP per annum funding target.\nMr. Speaker I am also introducing a National Credit Card. The purpose of the card is to give all citizens access to the private sector for essential services such as health and education on a means-tested basis. Just taking the health and schools budgets alone costs the taxpayer around £250 billion a year. If 50% used the private sector instead, and the average means-tested support for fees was also 50%, then the saving to the taxpayer would be over £60 billion a year.\nWe shall have to introduce this gradually to enable the supply side to meet increasing demand and it will be optional. Users pay for services in the normal way but do not have to settle the card at the end of the month. Instead after the end of the year when the taxman assesses your tax he will also review how much you have spent on your card, put the two together and recharge your share of the cost to your tax bill for the following year. Working capital will come from the Sovereign Wealth Fund at 5% which will be added to your costs from the date of purchase, but users will be able to pay on account to avoid it. The means test rate will be a simple percentage set at the beginning of each fiscal year for each user set in due course to encourage 50% usage. Much of these savings will then be available to improve the state services, and the fact that the private sector is accessible to all will remove any stain of privilege that some attribute to it at present.\nMr. Speaker, with the help of my RH colleagues I am taking a number of measures to improve efficiency within our public services. First we shall be splitting the civil service clean in two so that the advisory side, which advises ministers on current problems and future legislation, becomes completely separate and independent from the executive side, which delivers services mandated by Parliament. Two completely separate functions requiring separate organisational structures. This way the advisory side can assist ministers in holding the executive side to account.\nSecond we shall be appointing a national chief executive with the power to hire and fire local chief executives for every national public service. It is an extraordinary fact that currently few if any of our public services actually have any top management at all. No wonder they are all running around like headless chickens being hopelessly inefficient.\nThese chief executives will be mandated to ensure that sufficient trained British staff are recruited into each service, that they are paid the rate for the job so that staff turnover rates are minimised, and that agency and support staff are reduced to less than 25% of payroll each. I am also allowing staff bonuses to be paid out of 10% of any local budget savings or collected charges.\nThird, I am abolishing national wage bargaining in the tax funded public sector. Henceforth all such staff will be paid a full inflationary increase on 1st April each year. I reject the argument that this will create an inflationary wage spiral on the grounds both that there are no prices in this sector and that inflation increases the tax base anyway. But it is also important for staffing stability that all staff are paid the rate for the job, which will vary by skill and location across the country with additional increases awarded locally and which therefore cannot be addressed on a national basis.\nThese measures taken together could save another £30 billion a year as well as ensure they are no longer dependent on immigration for staff.\nSpeaking of immigration, my RH friend the Home Secretary will be scrapping the current points-based system and replacing it with an auctioned reducing quota system so that total immigration is reduced to below emigration rates within five years. It is therefore vital that we are able to reduce unemployment at the same or faster rate. Indeed we currently have over 3% job vacancies across our economy which is roughly double historical norms and only serves to suck in yet more immigrants. I shall therefore be instructing the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee henceforth to use a composite 4% target when setting interest rates; that is 2% inflation plus 2% job vacancies. I anticipate this will mean interest rates will remain at around the 5% mark for the foreseeable future, which is necessary anyway to encourage savings and fund investment, and will also probably be needed to contain the inflationary impact of wage rises in a tighter labour market. I shall be addressing the housing market separately in a few moments.\nIn addition I have a new regional policy designed to reduce the regional pay and unemployment gaps. It must make sense to focus stimulation to where unemployment is highest post code by post code across the country leading eventually to an even level of percentage employment across the land. This will increase income tax revenues and reduce welfare claims so it is likely to be fiscally neutral in the longer term.\nTo do so I shall cease funding new free tax and enterprise zones, which have a very chequered and uneven history, and instead introduce discounts for income tax, business rates and employers national insurance where the discount is proportionate to the local level of unemployment. For the coming year this discount will be 5% for every 1% that unemployment, measured on the claimant basis, is above 5%. We will review this algorithm annually to ensure a steady reduction in the regional gap.\nI also have a number of measures to free up the labour market to reduce structural unemployment. First I am repealing all IR35 legislation, which was designed to prevent employers avoiding the cost of national insurance contributions on permanent staff, by the simple measure of charging the invoices of self-employed and agency staff to NICs also. Professional fees will be exempt. The increased revenues will be used to reduce employers NICs for all so that the measure is fiscally neutral.\nIn any case I am immediately reducing employers NICs to 12% and increasing the minimum wage and universal credits in line with the triple lock on the state pension. I am also introducing marginal relief for employers NI with a zero alowance of £1000 per week of payroll, and a lower band of £2000 at a rate of half the full rate.\nSecond my RH friend the Work and Pensions Secretary will be undertaking a full post-implementation review of the introduction of Universal Credits with a view to making it simpler and more streamlined and efficient. In particular he will ensure that the thresholds for and rates of clawback are also universal, and that once vetted claimants do not have to reapply every time they get a gap between jobs. This is particularly important for self-employed people who currently often decline short term or low paid assignments because of the hassle and delays in reapplying.\nWithin this context I am increasing the threshold, or earnings disregard, for clawback of universal credits to £50 per week. This will create a much greater incentive for unemployed people to make that first leap back into employment, and will also allow low paid workers in the taper to keep more of what they themselves have earned. This will both reduce the poverty trap and the pressure on food banks many of which are struggling to obtain sufficient supplies.\nMr. Speaker, I now turn to support for farmers and care homes. At first sight they do not have much in common but they are both essential to our wellbeing, are competitive within the private sector and yet need financial support if they are to produce both food and care at affordable levels and remain profitable. Furthermore farmers are in competition with foreign imports which are heavily subsidised.\nFor both industries I am introducing a public subsidy at 10% on turnover. This will be subject to a profit cap at 5% before tax to prevent profiteering by larger businesses at the expense of both taxpayer and customer. The subsidy is designed to promote sales, and the profit cap will encourage competitive pricing and support greater expenditure. Qualifying directors remuneration will be restricted. In future years the rate of subsidy will be adjusted so that no more than 5% of businesses liquidate each year.\nMany businesses in a variety of industries receive public subsidies and there has been much concern at their profits. I am therefore extending the profit cap to all entities in receipt of public subsidy, though the cap may vary according to their capital investment requirements. I am also extending it proportionately to all companies with contracts with the public sector worth annually over 10% of their turnover.\nFinally Mr. Speaker I come to the housing market. I shall be reducing house prices from now on by between 1 and 2% a year on average. This is easily done by giving the Bank of England that target and by tightening criteria such as mortgage to value and income to mortgage used by commercial lenders.\nNow you may at first sight think that would make it more difficult for prospective purchasers to find and buy a new house, but in fact that is not so. For one thing the number of available houses out there does not change, and for another the supply is likely to increase because sellers will hurry to sell before prices reduce further. More importantly developers will no longer be able to make capital gains on their land banks and so can only build houses on them and sell them. In monetary terms the reduction in demand will be matched by a reduction is prices until all available houses are sold.\nThe misconstrued Help to Buy policy has just made matters worse, so I am in effect reversing it. Last year fewer new houses were built than before the policy was introduced over ten years ago and it has just pushed house prices even higher. Irrespective of whether we can balance supply and demand, the amount of credit tied up in the housing market means that house prices are likely to remain high. Yet house prices must come down if younger people are to buy when they get married and start a family and others to escape the parental nest and develop as independent adults.\nCurrently it takes on average over five years to build out a granted planning consent whereas no so long ago it was only two. It has been reported that there are hundreds of thousands of such consents gathering dust in the pending trays of property developers because they can make more money from capital gains. But it is important to understand also that they have themselves been squeezed by increasing land prices. As a result they have endeavoured to recoup their margins by resorting to dodgy practices such as denying buyers adequate snagging periods and tying them up into leaseholds with uncontrollable ground rent increases, and generally cutting costs and building to very low standards. Many such properties are now unsaleable. Mr. Speaker I am giving Help to Buy purchasers a new six month snagging period, with a survey at taxpayer’s expense to ensure objectivity, and with all restitution costs at the sellers expense.\nMy RH friend the Secretary of State for Housing, will be carrying out a full review of planning and related procedures including the possible repeal of the 1961 Land Compensation Act which gives 100% of all planning gain to landowners. We believe it may be more appropriate to divide planning gain equally between landowners, a national development corporation with powers of compulsory purchase to focus new development in the North where there are plentiful brownfield sites available, supported by regional policy which will encourage both people and jobs to move there, and local development corporations who can use the money for local infrastructure thereby creating balanced communities. The South East is overcrowded and current development priorities just make that worse. They are levelling down not levelling up. We will protect and maintain the green belt.\nOn social housing I am restoring the full housing benefit which will become affordable again as immigration falls. This will allow housing associations access to the City for development finance, and I shall be adding a government guarantee to help reduce borrowing costs. We will continue to support Right to Buy as it does not reduce total housing available but I am halving the discounts.\nFollowing the Grenfell Tower Tragedy many leaseholders have become trapped with spiralling service charges which they cannot pay. I am therefore limiting service charge increases to inflation backdated to the date of the tragedy, and will refund landlords forced into loss by this, subject to reasonable limits on insurance premiums and other costs.\nIn summary Mr. Speaker I anticipate that for the coming year tax increases and expenditure savings with bring in around £80 billion and tax reductions and expenditure increases cost around £20 billion, giving my target net saving of £60 billion. I am also placing a five and ten year Source and Application of Funds Statement in the library and online. So now it just remains for me to I thank the House for their patience and attention during this speech. It is a budget for working people and small businesses combined with a strategy to save Britain, and I commend it to the House.",
  "https_jepoynton_com_/https_jepoynton_com_2019_06_06_carillion/content_17.html": "The government is in the process of reviewing what needs to be done to prevent such corporate collapses happening again, and is in receipt of substantial petitions on the subject, so here is my two pen’orth.\nThe prime focus of the protests and review is on whether the auditors could and should have picked up the warning signs and issued a qualified audit report on the basis that Carillon was no longer a going concern. So the first point to make is that even if they had the damage may have already been done, and if so probably nothing would have been different. I don’t know if the warning signs were there at the time of the most recent audit anyway, but let us assume for this discussion that they were and they were missed. That would be a simple failure in practice that could always occur.\nOne proposal being pushed is that audit firms be split up with their tax and consultancy arms floated off separately. I qualified as a Chartered Accountant with one of the big firms in London in the early 1970s, and shortly after transferred to the management consultancy division. The first thing I noticed is that it was not a division at all. It was a completely separate practice trading at arms-length from the main firm. Indeed there were some audit partners who would not let us management consultants anywhere near their clients! The audit partners who did pass work to us saw their role as being able to offer a wide range of services to their clients which they could oversee on behalf of their client. There was nothing financial in it for them then, and I do not suppose that has changed since.\nSo is there a problem here, or are we just looking for scapegoats? I think there is.\nFor an auditor to qualify an audit report is a hugely damaging decision for both of them, and to do so on the basis that the client is no longer a going concern is incendiary. It takes a lot of courage. So the larger and more significant the client the more difficult the decision. Some people have proposed that the big firms be broken up into smaller practices, but that would just make the client significance problem even greater, and the question of ancillary services is not even relevant. The other suggestion being bandied about is for an audit watchdog, some sort of auditor’s auditor, or for auditing by state auditors. Neither of these suggestions it seems to me addresses the actual problem, and would just add complication and cost and almost certainly a deterioration of service. Yes, state auditors would be more independent, but the cost to the taxpayer would be huge and could not possibly be justified.\nHowever there is another possibility and that is the creation of shareholder supervisory boards (SSBs). I have recommended these separately in relation to fat-cat pay and over-ambitious mergers and acquisitions. Responsibility for appointing and reviewing the auditors is an obvious addition. It would change relationship between the Directors and Auditors completely, making it much more arms-length. The half dozen or so largest shareholders on the register at any time would comprise the board, together with the Chairman, MD, FD and one Non-exec, and where significant government contracts are involved a government representative could be included too. Key decisions have to be made much more quickly these days than can be deferred to all of the shareholders in general meeting, and in any case it is the Directors who get to draft the resolutions. An SSB could make quick interim decisions and approve the resolutions first.\nI would also change company law to make the shareholders supreme once again. Even today Directors can over-rule the shareholders on key decisions including resolutions about their own pay. This goes back to the 1890s when the Bank of Glasgow went bust and everyone asked why the shareholders had made such bad decisions. It turned out that most shareholders in those days were retired vicars and little old ladies and so on who had no professional training at all, so it made sense to give the Directors the final say. Today the situation is completely different with most shareholders being highly proficient asset and pension fund managers. Time to repeal this one!\nFinally there is the question of limited liability. I am extremely surprised that the risky contracts that brought Carillion down were not being conducted through subsidiaries with limited liability. The conglomerate structure that you will find in most large companies is designed to do this so that if one subsidiary goes bust the rest of the group is unaffected. Bad luck on the creditors of the subsidiary of course because they have no recourse to the holding company or the rest of the group, but it makes sense overall. If a subsidiary is considered to be taking on too much risk there are always insurance options available.",

I have designed a new leaflet which also has been accepted onto the Bruges Group website here, and which you can view in the original here. I am also in the process of sending a copy by post to ever single member of the House of Commons, so lets hope they get past their gatekeepers and find their recipients in open-minded mood.\nA further point has occurred to me and I have asked my own MP, Cheryl Gillan, to ask the following in the House:\n“firstly whether any of the UK companies who outsource component manufacture to the continent receive any subsidies from the European Union, and, secondly, whether or not they do, those companies donate to the Conservative Party? It strikes me as extremely odd that such companies would wish to manufacture on the continent which one of the most expensive places to do so in the world. It would surely require substantial subsidies to make that viable. This leads me to wonder whether we have a supply chain of corruption going on here, with the companies in the pocket of the EU, and the Conservative Party in the pocket of the companies. If this is the case then the British public and their representatives need to know before a vote on Chequers is taken.”",
  "https_jepoynton_com_/https_jepoynton_com_2022_10_27_was-john-maynard-keynes-considered-a-failure/content_19.html": "Herewith my answer to another question on Quora.\nYou don’t want to get too tied down by the General Theory. It’s complexity undermines its validity and he appears to have been transfixed by Einstein’s general theory of Relativity which genuinely did extend the boundaries of physics rendering what we now call Classical Physics as merely a special case. Go to the extremes of matter moving close to the speed of light or the interaction of sub-atomic particles (or waves – see Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle) and the classical laws of physics break down. But that does not mean that classical physics is redundant. It is still used for every day understanding and technology including rocket science! I suspect that Keynes wanted to be seen as having done something similar for economics, but he didn’t.\nHowever he did undoubtedly extend our understanding of fiscal macroeconomics beyond the received wisdom of Alfred Marshall and the Cambridge school, which were largely based on microeconomics, and those theories are as valid today as they were then.\nThere are three broad elements to macroeconomics: fiscal, monetary and international trade. The first two are now broadly understood, but I see little evidence of any understanding of the economics of international trade amongst our politicians and bureaucrats. Free trade is commonly regarded as a general panacea but in fact it breaks down in the case of substantial deficits. A good example of this is the EU Single Market. That is free trade, yet the UK’s experience of being in the single market has been a disaster, resulting in a trade deficit now of nearly 7% GDP, which undermines investment and growth. Clearly business will not invest into a contracting market, and UK GDP/capita growth has plummeted in parallel.",
  "https_jepoynton_com_/https_jepoynton_com_2015_09_24_why-the-single-market-is-a-bad-idea/content_50.html": "Many people who are prepared to consider changing our relationship with the EU still say that remaining a member of the Single Market is essential to our economic future. But why, exactly? Do they actually understand what it is? Let’s have a closer look.\nAs I see it there are three principle characteristics to the Single Market as follows:\n1). The harmonisation of commercial standards and procedures. Yes – all jolly good stuff. But it’s been done now and is water under the bridge. Nobody is suggesting we revert to the old arrangements, so it’s not an issue. In any case we can always voluntarily choose to adopt new standards at any time if we so wish.\n2). The removal of tariffs and other barriers to trade. Again all very useful, but done now and nobody is suggesting they be resurrected in the event of Brexit except as a mirror image on our side of what is now there [Also see PPS below]. It is certainly not in Brussels’ interests to do so as we import more from the continent than we export. Roger Helmer also has some interesting perspectives on this here. In any case if we had to go back after Brexit to trading under WTO rules both imports and exports would reduce so the deficit as a whole would reduce, which would help conserve employment within the UK! A blessing in disguise? Certainly we can handle it either way, so it’s not an issue.\n3). The creation of free movement of people between member states and of capital within the eurozone. This is the crux of the matter and has created massive instability within both the eurozone and the EU as a whole. It has been like removing the bulkheads from within an ocean-going oil tanker. As soon as the first big wave comes along all the oil slops down one end and the tanker up-ends and sinks.\nAsk any economist or businessman what they consider to be the single most important precondition for steady long-term economic growth, and almost certainly they will say ‘stability’, or something similar. So why do they contradict themselves when it comes to membership of the Single Market? Roger Helmer may again have the answer here, where he observes how Brussels will stop listening to any large organisation that does not toe its party line. The access that their size and wealth affords these organisations to lobby the EU creates a lumpy playing field to the detriment of all who have to compete with them. It is SME’s that create most jobs.\nIt is also noticeable how many will jump to unfounded conclusions. For example Labour claim that all EU laws now on our statute books, including employment protection legislation, will automatically be erased. It won’t. Academic institutions, who ought to to know better, assume that all international cooperation will come to a standstill. Nobody is suggesting that temporary residence will be a problem, and as for citizenship the aim is simply balance.\nI would say ‘balance and stability’ in all things. Balance in our fiscal accounts, our external trade, in monetary policy, regional policy, the balance between employment and inflation, between left and right (equality vs free enterprise and aspiration) and of course balanced migration. Indeed that is how I would describe UKIP’s position on the political spectrum as a Centre party.\nPS. 03 Feb 2016.

  "https_jepoynton_com_/https_jepoynton_com_2015_11_02_janet-daley-misfires-on-tax-credits/content_60.html": "Janet Daley is one of the Sunday Telegraph’s more robust commentators and often has interesting things to say, but yesterday she completely screwed up over the arguments for reforming tax credits. You can find her article here, but the most offending passage reads as follows:-\n“What was missing from the Osborne defence was a very persuasive moral argument against government topping up low wages and thus creating a low-pay trap. The economist Arthur Laffer has said: ‘If you pay people to be poor, you will get more and more poor people.’ He was referring specifically to the benefit-dependent underclass held in permanent poverty by the welfare system that created perverse disincentives to work. But the same principle applies to tax credits: if you pay people to be low-paid, you will get more and more low-paid people. Instead of low-wage jobs simply being an entry point to employment, or a temporary stop-gap at particular stages of life, they become the permanent condition of a whole tranche of the population. Because low rates of pay automatically trigger the government tax credit system – raising the total income to an acceptable level – there is no pressure on the employer to offer more or the worker to seek anything better.”\nNO, Janet, tax credits do NOT cause employers to pay low wages. Only one thing does that and that is the balance of supply and demand for labour. Wages are low partly because we are still in recession and partly because of high levels of immigration. Have you ever met anyone who does not wish to be better off? Even millionaires want to be billionaires! It depends on their negotiating position and on what employers can afford.\nWhere you are right is that there is indeed a strong moral case for reform. Reform to deal with structure and perverse incentives rather than to reduce the cost per se. The cost is cyclical and will come down as unemployment comes down. Unfortunately unemployment is now more likely to rise again due to a combination of austerity at the wrong phase of the economic cycle, high rates of immigration and the government’s interventionist intention to increase the minimum wage.\nTax credits are a duplicate welfare system which were originally introduced as a way of overcoming the poverty trap (‘making work pay’ in modern parlance). A much better, cheaper and more efficient way of doing that is to increase the earnings disregards under the old system, now aka Universal Credits. Yet Osborne has done precisely the opposite by reducing them. As so often with this government and the coalition before it the rhetoric says one thing and the action says completely the opposite. Work pays less now than it did before!\nOsborne is not an intellectual. He runs for the hills at the slightest challenge. We saw it in 2012 and we are seeing it again now. That is why he cannot make the case. For a more detailed review see my previous post here.\nPS. Since posting this on the Telegraph’s page I received there a couple of interesting comments concerning the Iron Law of Wages and the Speenhamland system. I responded as follows:-\n“I don’t know what the unemployment rate was in 1834, but I suspect it was quite high. Hence the downwards pressure on wages.\nOne point that does come out of this discussion though is how comparatively rare it is that governments manage to get unemployment down to the sorts of levels that would produce sustained wage increases. It seems to boil down to how we manage inflation.\nBack in the 70s and 80s any wage inflation quickly developed into a comparative wage-price spiral, forcing the government to slam on the economic brakes. With union reform that may no longer be the case, but now we have property price inflation instead.\nIt seems to me that there are at least four different types of inflation that require quite different policy responses: wage inflation, import inflation, property inflation and general inflation. I would welcome both wage and import inflation at a moderate and constant level; the latter because we need a much more competitive exchange rate to stop jobs being exported. These are both cost-push types of inflation and so not particularly volatile. That means measuring each separately and managing property inflation by restricting mortgage availability and only general inflation by increasing interest rates. Wage and import inflation could then be given much more leeway.\nI would also welcome a change in the way we determine public sector wages, which are invariably reduced to a political football much to the detriment of our public services. No successful private sector employer would underpay his staff because otherwise he would lose them, and all the investment he has made in recruitment, training, team and experience building would be written off. The general approach is to look at staff turnover rates and increase wages when they are getting too high. We should do the same in the public sector, permitting any local HR manager to appeal for an increase on the basis of auditable high staff turnover rates.\nI maintain that the rate for any job has nothing to do with comparatives but is determined by the balance of supply and demand for that particular skill in that particular location and at that particular level of seniority. And maybe some other factors as well. An appeals process would enable public sector wages to be increased when and where it became necessary.”",

  "https_jepoynton_com_/https_jepoynton_com_2019_05_31_labour-shortages/content_11.html": "The Government’s Migration Advisory Committee wants to increase the number of jobs on the list aimed at plugging gaps in the UK labour market. Jobs on the Shortage Occupation List are effectively allowed to jump the queue for workers from outside the European Economic Area. Their review said there should be a big expansion of jobs on the list. Under these proposals, the list would cover 9% of jobs in the labour market, compared with approximately 1% currently.\nWhat the government fails to realise is that the economy is over-heating. The alarm bells of inflation no longer ring because open borders mean that the labour market never tightens. The system introduced by Ken Clarke and Gordon Brown whereby the Bank of England can set interest rates to apply the brakes when this happens no longer works. Thus it has become a self-fulfilling prophesy that we are always going to be ‘short’ of labour and key skills however many people we let in.\nIt is perfectly possible for any government to achieve full employment (strictly speaking that level of employment before inflation takes off) with the right combination of fiscal, monetary and exchange-rate policy. Currently the economy is booming because of the devaluation that followed the referendum and the authorisation of a further £70bn of Quantitative Easing later in 2016. It is quite possible this was a misjudgement because they did not expect the boost from devaluation!\nIn fact immigrants do not ‘take our jobs’ as the government can simply increase consumer demand in this way to accommodate any level of population, though it may not seem that way during a recession. If immigration were restricted then conversely the level of consumer demand could be set to match that lower level of population and you would still have full employment.\nThere are many reasons why we do not want net immigration to this country which I am sure I do not need to rehearse. Personally I would prefer a Quota and Auction system to Nigel’s Australian points-based system, some loose version of which we now seem to have, because it would create a far less bureaucratic and more open competitive market for the skills we need as well as giving much more direct control over the actual numbers involved.\nEmployers wanting to import labour, and others wanting to come under their own steam, would have to buy a place in a monthly quota, which we can gradually tighten until they realise it would be cheaper to train up and employ British staff. We also need urgent reform of the welfare system to remove the poverty trap and reverse the sadistic implementation of Universal Credits this government is fixated about and which is having completely the opposite effect. I want to see self-assessment for benefits. We have it for tax, so why not for benefits, with payment by return on submission of an online timesheet? As Nigel doesn’t seem to understand, there is more to Brexit than Brexit. It needs a whole raft of additional policies if we are to avoid a C&D (crash and disaster).",
  "https_jepoynton_com_/https_jepoynton_com_2019_02_08_nissan-felixstowe-lettuces-and-whisky/content_47.html": "I am sure we all understand the situation Nissan and other companies which export a majority of their UK production to the Eurozone will find themselves in after Brexit. They will face 10% tariffs by the EU on these exports, and it stands to commercial reason they would then be better off re-locating their production into the Eurozone, where they would face 10% tariffs only on their re-exports into the UK – a lesser percentage of their total turnover. Neither we nor they want that.\nThe obvious solution is export subsidies. Payments would be made directly to the foreign importer on presentation of their receipt for import tariffs paid, with the exporter acting simply as agent. We could for example implement an export subsidy regime which is a mirror-image of our import tariff regime, with the latter funding the former. For as long as we run a deficit the Treasury would make a profit, but when we move into surplus it would make sense to negotiate trade deals wholly or partly removing both subsidies and tariffs together. Provided our import tariffs, and thus export subsidies, on cars are the same as the EU’s Nissan will not be affected by Brexit. Indeed the effect would be like unilateral free trade for exports only – no need to negotiate anything with anyone!\nThe question then arises as to whether this would contravene WTO rules. These are governed by the Anti-Dumping Regulations and the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, often referred to together as “AD-CVD”. Dumping and subsidies — together with anti-dumping (AD) measures and countervailing duties (CVD) — share a number of similarities. Many countries handle the two under a single law, apply a similar process to deal with them and give a single authority responsibility for investigations. Occasionally, the two WTO committees responsible for these issues meet jointly.\nI am not a lawyer but it seems clear to me that my proposal would neither be dumping – defined as the export of a product at a price lower than the price it normally charges on its own home market, nor would it contravene either of the two categories of subsidy –Prohibited subsidies: subsidies that require recipients to meet certain export targets, or to use domestic goods instead of imported goods, or Actionable subsidies: in this category the complaining country has to show that the subsidy has an adverse effect on its interests, otherwise the subsidy is permitted.\nArticle 2 of the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures defines a prohibited subsidy as being a payment to a specific entity within the jurisdiction of the granting authority. The payments I advocate here are payment to entities outside our own jurisdiction and are therefore perfectly legal.\nIn any case the most sensible course of action, which needless to say Theresa May’s government has not taken, is to negotiate a special transitional agreement with the WTO which could remain in force until we have eliminated our trade deficit. Such an agreement would be in the WTO’s interests as it has been unable to negotiate any further General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade (GATTs) since 1994, due to the massive international trade imbalances that have developed around the world since the onset of globalisation.\nWe need a new international regime which promotes equilibrium at balance. My proposal would not only do that from the UK’s perspective, it could also, with the proviso that only deficit countries may pay subsidies, be rolled out by the WTO as an international standard to everyone’s benefit, thereby recreating the conditions under which free-trade deals would be mutually beneficial. Otherwise there is always the option of not re-joining the WTO! For our economic survival our prime focus must be on eliminating our current account deficit as described in my last post. My proposal gives us for the first time the tools to manage our trade balance.\nLet’s also just think through what WTO Rules mean as far as import tariffs are concerned. There are two principal requirements. First the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) rules require us to charge the same tariffs to all countries for each product category, and second, once we have re-joined, we cannot increase our tariffs we can only reduce them.\nThis means we have quite a wide range of options on how we set these tariffs (strictly speaking after Brexit but before we rejoin). We can level up to the EU tariffs, or even beyond, or we can level down to zero, or we can cherry-pick somewhere in between. It would make most sense to charge tariffs on those goods where UK producers can substitute, but zero-rate those we cannot or where we don’t want a cliff-edge increase in prices such as lettuces. However we do want to encourage UK producers to substitute for imports. This means a gradualist and selective approach; the former would have to be agreed with the WTO. We also want to make sure we raise tariffs as much as we can to maximise revenues for the Treasury as well as reduce the deficit.\nImport tariffs are just another tax, but they are unique as a form of taxation that boosts the economy and creates jobs. Obviously (one would have thought) placing tariffs on both sides of the Channel will make foreign stuff more expensive than British stuff, which means people will buy more British stuff and less foreign stuff, thereby reducing the deficit, creating jobs, boosting the economy and providing additional income for the Treasury all at the same time! If we level up to EU tariff rates the additional income for the Treasury could be as much as £25bn. Of course the same is true on the other side of the Channel, but as we have a deficit the impact is less. All this talk of crashing out and disaster is pure Remainian fantasy.\nOf course there are always those Magic Money Tree growers who want zero tariffs now! Zero tariffs will have the opposite effect and just increase the deficit still further. But consider this. Given that the Treasury must fund public expenditure somehow, whatever level of expenditure we settle at, and that all other forms of taxation reduce consumer demand and employment, surely it makes sense to have import tariffs in the mix?\nIn recent days we have seen a resumption of Project Fear, but we must address the points that arise and show how we will deal with them otherwise uncertainty will continue. I have answered the Nissan and Lettuce issues above, so that leaves Felixstowe and Whisky unless I have missed something.\nThe Felixstowe issue involves bonded containers arriving from Asia with products for re-export all over Europe. The concern is that they will face double tariffs; once here and then again on re-export. Again the solution is obvious – zero-rate imports for re-export! We will be perfectly free to do that. Yes we would lose 20% of the tariff revenues (the other 80% is paid across to Brussels anyway at present), but that is peanuts compared to the revenues we will be getting after Brexit.\nThe Whisky issue is a classic government cock-up. This concerns those countries with which the EU has free-trade agreements, such as South Korea. On Brexit, if we haven’t agreed roll-over treaties with those countries, our exports will face their normal tariffs – 20% in the case of whisky to South Korea. Needless to say the Government could have started doing this two years ago but hasn’t. As a result there are now ships loaded to the gunnels with whisky for South Korea, for example, and they are not expected to arrive until after 29th March. As the Government is culpable it should bear the cost of these tariffs until the relevant roll-over treaty is in place so that trade can continue smoothly.",

  "https_jepoynton_com_/https_jepoynton_com_2018_03_22_the-economic-case-for-brexit/content_61.html": "Over the past couple of weeks I have been lobbying as many members of the House of Lords as I can with the following email as they debate the EU (Withdrawal) Bill. This is not an easy task as there are restrictions on bulk emails, but thankfully many members retain their own personal addresses, and there are ways round the central system to some extent anyway. So here is what I have sent.\nDear Lord or Baroness X\nTHE ECONOMIC CASE FOR BREXIT\nI should be grateful if you would spare a few moments of your time checking out the economic case for Brexit which I set out below. This has scarcely been examined in any detail in public and we face the terrifying prospect of members of both Houses taking momentous decisions about the future of our country without the benefit of a full and proper briefing. There is no need to depend on the type of bland assertions, lazy assumptions, dodgy forecasts and personal opinions with which the establishment has bombarded us. Hard facts and logic are available and compelling.\nDo we really want to carry on like this?\nI start with a couple of graphs using data I have downloaded from the Office for National Statistics’ website.\nThe first shows a deterioration in our trade deficit by almost 6% of GDP over the past twenty years, whilst the second shows how average incomes are growing at an ever slower and paltry rate. With widening income and regional gaps it is likely that many people are experiencing a real fall in their standard of living. This coincides with the onset of globalisation and our joining the EU Single Market. The EU been responsible for our trading affairs over this period of time and is thus guilty of monumental failure. That alone should be sufficient to sack them.\nThe link between trade and economic growth\nI am not talking here about the correlation between global growth and free trade, which is well supported by research. A closer look at that research however shows that it is only the surplus countries, like Germany, Japan and China, which benefit, while deficit countries like the UK and US have missed out and declined. There has in fact been a transfer of existing wealth from the deficit countries to the surplus countries as well as growth in the recipient ones.\nAt national level a deficit is like having a hole in the bottom of our economy. If nothing were done about it unemployment would go through the roof. Fortunately the Bank of England has been able to put its finger in the dyke using Quantitative Easing. This works by reducing interest rates thereby encouraging people to borrow more, save less and use up their existing savings. As Mervyn King put it in his recent book, The End of Alchemy, people are now spending their future earnings today. This, he goes on, cannot continue for long because sooner or later tomorrow becomes today and they cannot borrow any more. They will also have used up existing savings. The low interest rates also have the effect of limiting saving, which starves the banks of money to lend to business for investment in new technology and productivity growth. The productivity gap has been well documented as you know, though curiously the obvious cause ignored. This does lead me to suppose that the establishment is only showing us the side of the coin it wants us to see.\nIt is therefore imperative that we end QE to increase interest rates by balancing our trade before a new financial crisis hits us and to re-establish savings and growth. There are only two ways this can be achieved; though devaluation and by increasing our import tariffs. We have already had some benefit from devaluation following the referendum, but its size is determined by the markets. That just leaves import tariffs as a direct instrument of government.\nWhilst a no-deal Brexit will be a substantial step in the right direction, there is no guarantee it will be enough. We must retain the flexibility after Brexit to set our import tariffs at a level which will balance our trade. This may mean delaying re-joining the WTO. Conversely any attempt to do a trade deal with the EU, or anyone else for that matter, will limit that flexibility, whilst remaining in the Single Market will lock us into the £115bn trade deficit we currently have. We would then be completely stymied and helpless. Please note that the Government’s enthusiasm about the opportunities for doing trade deals around the world is misplaced, at least until we have established a balance. Indeed this is also the principal reason why the Doha round of global trade talks collapsed; the precondition of balance was not met.\nJobs\nWe all want to see the creation of more jobs, particularly in the manufacturing sector outside London and the South East, and I am not surprised the Labour Party have recently made this their priority. Their tragedy is that they have got the argument completely back-to-front, by concluding it requires us to remain in the EU customs union and single market when the very reverse is the case.\nEven though the above graphs show clearly what a disaster EU membership has been for trade and growth in the UK, the following logic demonstrates it further. We have this massive trade deficit with the EU. That means our imports are greater than our exports. Suppose now we place import tariffs on both sides of the channel, which is what a no-deal Brexit would involve. The result will obviously be a reduction in the volume of trade. Assuming the tariffs are at the same percentage level on both sides, the reduction in percentage trade volumes will be similar. But that means that the absolute reduction in imports will be greater than the absolute reduction in exports since we start with a deficit. This in turn means that the number of new jobs created from import substitution will be greater than the number lost to export substitution, ie a net increase. In short it is the balance of trade that matters, not the volume.\nInward Investment\nOne of the more amusing spectacles in recent weeks has been that of the Japanese ambassador claiming that Brexit would discourage investment into this country. Now that really is trying to have your cake and eat it! UK manufacturers have already had a competitive boost of about 12% from devaluation, so the 10% cost of EU vehicle import tariffs will still leave them better off. The two go together.\nThere has also been much talk about supply chains. These will chop and change as a matter of course anyway, but any disruption could be minimised by not charging tariffs on components and spare parts. This would have the added advantage of encouraging all vehicle manufacturers to do their final assembly here in the UK.\nThe Brexit Fiscal Dividend\nMuch has already been written about the savings from EU budget payments and I don’t propose to go over old ground here. I trust it is fair to say that a net saving of £10bn a year is not controversial. It is other savings that have been overlooked.\nFirst there is the matter of import tariff revenues on imports from outside the EU. These amount to about 60% of all imports of some £625bn a year, on which the EU customs union currently collects just over 4% as import tariffs, ie about £15bn. We pay 80% of these, £12bn, over to Brussels. Clearly after Brexit we will continue to collect this money. Nor will it cause any inflation to do so as it is already in force. All that will change is that we will keep the £12bn for ourselves! Funny how nobody ever mentions that. So that now gives a total dividend of £22bn.\nBut that is not all. We will of course also start to collect tariffs on our imports from the EU, another £10bn, total now £32bn. There will be some price increases from this, but spread over the whole economy they will contribute only about half a percent to inflation on a once off basis. Big deal.\nThere is more. A few months ago the Bruges Group produced a paper calculating savings from welfare and pension payments to immigrants and non-residents in the order of £35bn. You can find it at http://www.brugesgroup.com/blog/brexit-the-end-to-austerity. I have not been able to verify these figures myself, so to be safe let’s just accrue half, £18bn. That gives a total annual Brexit dividend of £50bn a year, FIVE TIMES the number that was bandied about during the referendum campaign.\nHow could any government in its right mind even think of throwing this sort of money away for nothing? Yet that is precisely what the Remainian camp are proposing to do. We need that money.\nThe Economic and Political cycles\nDo not be lulled by the latest indications of a fiscal surplus. This is just a cyclical anomaly caused by the combination of loose monetary policy and tight fiscal policy. Neither is sustainable, the former economically as I have explained above, and the latter politically. Before long politically irresistible calls for tax cuts from the Right and/or expenditure increases from the Left will destroy the balance just as the former did in the late 1980s resulting in the boom and bust. Let us not repeat the same mistake.\nBrexit offers us a way out by enabling us to tighten monetary policy to increase interest rates as the trade deficit is reduced, at the same time as loosening fiscal policy using the Brexit dividend to assuage political pressures, thereby keeping the two in balance. Carpe diem.\nYour support\nThe European Union (Withdrawal) Bill after completing the House of Commons is now progressing through the House of Lords. Your support for this will be greatly appreciated by millions of voters including myself. Whilst most voters will not understand the economic technicalities I have described above, they most certainly feel the results, and they are angry. The problem is exacerbated by the widening income and regional gaps so that Remainers on their massive metropolitan salaries are insulated from the consequences and do not feel them. This is not some right-wing xenophobic populist aberration; this is genuine democracy in action and a recipe for conflict if ignored and which will only increase without a no-deal Brexit.\nI ask you to conclude the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill’s passage through the House of Lords without opposing it or seeking to water down Brexit. And above all else without stipulating that there should be a further and thoroughly unnecessary second referendum. Nor should there be an opportunity for the decision to leave to be overturned. As a democrat I earnestly hope that in accordance with the referendum, the general election, and the EU (Notification of Withdrawal) Act, you will also approve the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill.\nPlease keep faith with the electorate and help restore our economy.\nYours sincerely,\nJohn Poynton FCA\n16th March 2018",
  "https_jepoynton_com_/https_jepoynton_com/content_1.html": "Mr. Speaker, it is an honour and a privilege for me to have this opportunity to present to the House the government’s budget for the coming year.\nAs the House will already know, our economy and government finances are in a desperate and sorry state. Over the past nearly 25 years we have suffered a series of setbacks that have enveloped us in a perfect storm, starting with our membership of the European Union Single Market which has seen our trade balance with those countries plummet from having been broadly in balance to a deficit at the time of the Brexit Referendum of £109 billion; that’s 6% of GDP at that time. This has presented British business with a contracting market. Generally speaking business will not invest into a contracting market, with the result that productivity growth has suffered.\nThen we had the banking crisis, triggered by an oil price spike in 2007 which led to the default of many sub-prime mortgages in the USA and which our banks had invested into. But there were also collapses on this side of the pond such as Northern Rock and HBOS which were simply due to over-trading, and that can only be due to a failure of regulation here. One bright spot then arises as the banks were quickly recapitalised through the use of quantitative easing, which did not on that occasion produce inflation as it was merely replacing credit which had been destroyed in the crisis. Unfortunately later on the QE was restarted with inevitable inflationary consequences.\nOn top of all that we had austerity and the failure to start a Sovereign Wealth Fund when interest rates hit the floor. Mr. Speaker, I am sure that most members are aware that 5% compounded will quadruple your money within 30 years, and 7% double it within ten. Over the past thirty years returns on many foreign shares have been far greater than the cost of government borrowing here. That is because the rate of growth in many other countries has been far faster than it has been here and is likely to continue that way for some time to come. It must make sense for us to benefit from their success in this way. A golden opportunity completely missed.\nThen we come to Brexit which some today are blaming for all our financial woes. Mr. Speaker, I do not accept that analysis but instead that the Trade and Co-operation Agreement has locked us into the catastrophic trade deficit we inherited from the Single Market. It is not enough to secure no tariffs in either direction when there are a host of other regulations creating the imbalance, and we need the use of tariffs to counter that effect. That will almost certainly mean scrapping the TCA, and whilst trade volumes may fall, the much greater effect of import substitution will present British business at home with the expanding market they crave to invest and create productivity growth and jobs.\nFollowing that we had Covid and the energy crisis caused by the war in Ukraine, thankfully temporarily as Russia has found other outlets into the international oil markets, and all of the panic over climate change. And if that weren’t enough mass immigration, quite apart from increasing cultural conflict within the country, has condemned wages to minimum levels, undermined working conditions and caused record levels of unemployment and homelessness. And to cap it all, we have an ageing population pushing the cost of pensions and health care through the roof. Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear!\nNow, Mr. Speaker, it is not my intention to spend time trying to apportion blame for this situation. Many of these circumstances were beyond our control, and for others it is easy to be wise after the event. My purpose is to identify the causes so we can take appropriate action to remedy them and to quantify the task itself. Our National Debt is now close to 100% of GDP after having been nearly paid off a quarter of a century ago, and the cost of interest on that debt is now over £100 billion a year, nearly 4% GDP in itself, and rising. The total fiscal deficit is around £170 billion and that is adding to the Debt all the time. It is imperative, Mr. Speaker, that we get our nose ahead of the game so that we can reverse the whole process.\nMy strategy is based on three key objectives necessary to provide a tripod of stability for our recovery. First I aim to achieve a fiscal surplus of 1% GDP within five years. Second I want a trade surplus of 1% GDP by that time, and third we must achieve net zero immigration as well. Add to that some essential tax cuts to motivate growth and expenditure increases to avoid imminent collapse of some public services and we are looking at an annual fiscal turnaround of £300 billion by the end of our first five years.\nOn average I must save £60 billion in each of the next five years, but that is only on average. There are couple of policies which can raise substantial funds in excess of this amount up front, while others such as revived economic growth will be weighted towards the end. The good news is that over the following five years those trends should lead to a much greater turnaround of around £450 billion or more, with much greater scope for both tax cuts and expenditure increases, which I shall aim broadly to keep equal. I shall also aim to cut the total level of taxation down to 30% GDP, whereas currently it is around 37%, all the while maintaining fiscal and trade surpluses of 1% GDP. History shows that all the economies with the highest rates of economic growth have run Balance of Payments surpluses and I am determined the UK should be in that group.\nSo, Mr. Speaker, let me make a start.\nMy first port of call is multinational corporations, which have long had a habit of shifting their profits into tax havens, or semi tax havens such as the Republic of Ireland, to avoid corporation tax in this country. Now I accept that at 25% our rate of corporation tax is too high, and I shall return to that later, but for now may I completely reject the argument that this country must somehow engage in a race to bottom just to remain competitive. There are other ways we can regulate our trade balance, and in any case if were able to collect what is morally due to us, profits made out purchases by the good citizens of this country, that would provide the funds to reduce it.\nOver ten years ago now, the G8 at its summit in Enniskillen tasked the OECD with ending this practice. They have completely failed to do so and show no signs of any significant progress as they just kick the can further on down the road. Clearly the multinationals have got to them! We cannot afford to wait any longer.\nThe good news is that this is very easy to rectify. Henceforth multinationals, which we shall define as any company that has more than 10% of its turnover in more than one country, shall be taxed on the basis of their global profits, as declared to their shareholders and in the public domain, and apportioned to this country by turnover, including non-domestic intercompany sales. They may be able to shift their head offices and their intellectual property rights, but they cannot shift their customers! It is difficult to forecast accurately without an established database exactly how much additional revenue this will raise, but our best estimates suggest it could be within the range of £40 to 50 billion if not more.\nSecond, Mr. Speaker, I am abolishing Inheritance Tax. It is a very inefficient tax, raising only about a third of 1% GDP; is double taxation in the hands of the deceased; uses up a disproportionate amount of tax legislation and consequently distracts the attention of thousands of lawyers and accountants who should be more constructively engaged.\nHowever I recognise that a society in which around 2% of the population own 80% of its assets is not a healthy one. I want to reduce this wealth gap but not eliminate it. It remains important that those with energy, ability and enterprise can profit from them for the benefit of us all. In practice however much of this accumulated wealth is passive asset appreciation.\nI therefore aim to raise about 2% GDP by charging legacies to capital gains tax in the hands of beneficiaries. This would require a 50% withholding tax to counter avoidance, but which would be repaid, with interest, when the gains are presented for assessment. I do not propose to introduce a wealth tax, which would also be double taxation in the hands of the taxpayer as well as very difficult to collect as much of it would disappear into overseas trusts and corporate structures.\nCapital gains will be assessed to income tax at the taxpayer’s marginal rate with no additional allowances. However I am allowing it to be spread over ten years so that poorer beneficiaries can use up more of their allowances and lower rate bands. This reflects the rule-of-thumb PE ratio of 10 often used to value small companies.\nExisting roll-over reliefs from inheritance tax such as for farms and businesses will be maintained and I am adding relief for the repayment of any student loans, not necessarily those of the taxpayer. Tax on occupied primary residences, again not necessarily by the taxpayer or his family, such as a sitting tenant, may be deferred until that occupant leaves.\nI am also abolishing Non-Dom status, but replacing it with a flat cap on income tax, including capital gains, of £250,000 in any one year.\nThese two changes alone should raise around £80 billion a year. I am not seeking to raise any other taxes. I am however reintroducing marginal relief from corporation tax for small businesses with a zero rate allowance of one million and a lower rate band of two million. The lower rate will be half the full rate which remains at 25%. In the longer term I aim to reduce taxation to 30% GDP and increase the personal tax allowance to match the typical minimum wage at £20,000, and reduce the top rate to 40%. I may also introduce an intermediate rate at 30%.\nMr. Speaker I now come to a series of changes focused on reducing the burden on the taxpayer without endangering essential public services by focusing on efficiency and alternative sources of finance.\nBetter late than never I am introducing a Sovereign Wealth Fund which will be funded by borrowing at an interest rate not greater than 5% and at an amount, if available in the gilts markets, of 1% GDP a year. The asset will offset the liability and therefore have no effect on net debt. This will be farmed out to multiple professional fund managers with after time the more successful attracting greater contributions.\nIn addition I am starting the funding of a new state pension. This necessarily must be a gradual and prolonged process which will not have any significant effect on the public finances for many years. It will be available only to those under the age of 25 on 6th April next year and will be optional. Modelling suggests it will primarily benefit those on above average salaries, thereby halving in due course the number in the existing state pension. This in turn may allow us to improve the existing state pension significantly. For those who opt in, the existing employee national insurance contribution of 8% becomes a national pension contribution and is placed in an account in their name to which a guaranteed 4% interest as added annually. Of the three parameters of contribution rate, retirement age and pension amount, they will have the flexibility to fix any two and get a quote for the third. They may opt in or change these parameters at a later date, subject to not reducing the pension to an annuity equivalent below the level that would trigger entitlement to pension credits, and their remaining entitlement to the existing state pension will be determined by the number of years’ contributions in the existing way. This will create a fully flexible and transferable pension scheme which is currently unavailable to many, including those who switch employment between the public and private sectors. The money will physically go into the Sovereign Wealth Fund, which should get a better return for carrying risk, and will be part of its 1% GDP per annum funding target.\nMr. Speaker I am also introducing a National Credit Card. The purpose of the card is to give all citizens access to the private sector for essential services such as health and education on a means-tested basis. Just taking the health and schools budgets alone costs the taxpayer around £250 billion a year. If 50% used the private sector instead, and the average means-tested support for fees was also 50%, then the saving to the taxpayer would be over £60 billion a year.\nWe shall have to introduce this gradually to enable the supply side to meet increasing demand and it will be optional. Users pay for services in the normal way but do not have to settle the card at the end of the month. Instead after the end of the year when the taxman assesses your tax he will also review how much you have spent on your card, put the two together and recharge your share of the cost to your tax bill for the following year. Working capital will come from the Sovereign Wealth Fund at 5% which will be added to your costs from the date of purchase, but users will be able to pay on account to avoid it. The means test rate will be a simple percentage set at the beginning of each fiscal year for each user set in due course to encourage 50% usage. Much of these savings will then be available to improve the state services, and the fact that the private sector is accessible to all will remove any stain of privilege that some attribute to it at present.\nMr. Speaker, with the help of my RH colleagues I am taking a number of measures to improve efficiency within our public services. First we shall be splitting the civil service clean in two so that the advisory side, which advises ministers on current problems and future legislation, becomes completely separate and independent from the executive side, which delivers services mandated by Parliament. Two completely separate functions requiring separate organisational structures. This way the advisory side can assist ministers in holding the executive side to account.\nSecond we shall be appointing a national chief executive with the power to hire and fire local chief executives for every national public service. It is an extraordinary fact that currently few if any of our public services actually have any top management at all. No wonder they are all running around like headless chickens being hopelessly inefficient.\nThese chief executives will be mandated to ensure that sufficient trained British staff are recruited into each service, that they are paid the rate for the job so that staff turnover rates are minimised, and that agency and support staff are reduced to less than 25% of payroll each. I am also allowing staff bonuses to be paid out of 10% of any local budget savings or collected charges.\nThird, I am abolishing national wage bargaining in the tax funded public sector. Henceforth all such staff will be paid a full inflationary increase on 1st April each year. I reject the argument that this will create an inflationary wage spiral on the grounds both that there are no prices in this sector and that inflation increases the tax base anyway. But it is also important for staffing stability that all staff are paid the rate for the job, which will vary by skill and location across the country with additional increases awarded locally and which therefore cannot be addressed on a national basis.\nThese measures taken together could save another £30 billion a year as well as ensure they are no longer dependent on immigration for staff.\nSpeaking of immigration, my RH friend the Home Secretary will be scrapping the current points-based system and replacing it with an auctioned reducing quota system so that total immigration is reduced to below emigration rates within five years. It is therefore vital that we are able to reduce unemployment at the same or faster rate. Indeed we currently have over 3% job vacancies across our economy which is roughly double historical norms and only serves to suck in yet more immigrants. I shall therefore be instructing the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee henceforth to use a composite 4% target when setting interest rates; that is 2% inflation plus 2% job vacancies. I anticipate this will mean interest rates will remain at around the 5% mark for the foreseeable future, which is necessary anyway to encourage savings and fund investment, and will also probably be needed to contain the inflationary impact of wage rises in a tighter labour market. I shall be addressing the housing market separately in a few moments.\nIn addition I have a new regional policy designed to reduce the regional pay and unemployment gaps. It must make sense to focus stimulation to where unemployment is highest post code by post code across the country leading eventually to an even level of percentage employment across the land. This will increase income tax revenues and reduce welfare claims so it is likely to be fiscally neutral in the longer term.\nTo do so I shall cease funding new free tax and enterprise zones, which have a very chequered and uneven history, and instead introduce discounts for income tax, business rates and employers national insurance where the discount is proportionate to the local level of unemployment. For the coming year this discount will be 5% for every 1% that unemployment, measured on the claimant basis, is above 5%. We will review this algorithm annually to ensure a steady reduction in the regional gap.\nI also have a number of measures to free up the labour market to reduce structural unemployment. First I am repealing all IR35 legislation, which was designed to prevent employers avoiding the cost of national insurance contributions on permanent staff, by the simple measure of charging the invoices of self-employed and agency staff to NICs also. Professional fees will be exempt. The increased revenues will be used to reduce employers NICs for all so that the measure is fiscally neutral.\nIn any case I am immediately reducing employers NICs to 12% and increasing the minimum wage and universal credits in line with the triple lock on the state pension. I am also introducing marginal relief for employers NI with a zero alowance of £1000 per week of payroll, and a lower band of £2000 at a rate of half the full rate.\nSecond my RH friend the Work and Pensions Secretary will be undertaking a full post-implementation review of the introduction of Universal Credits with a view to making it simpler and more streamlined and efficient. In particular he will ensure that the thresholds for and rates of clawback are also universal, and that once vetted claimants do not have to reapply every time they get a gap between jobs. This is particularly important for self-employed people who currently often decline short term or low paid assignments because of the hassle and delays in reapplying.\nWithin this context I am increasing the threshold, or earnings disregard, for clawback of universal credits to £50 per week. This will create a much greater incentive for unemployed people to make that first leap back into employment, and will also allow low paid workers in the taper to keep more of what they themselves have earned. This will both reduce the poverty trap and the pressure on food banks many of which are struggling to obtain sufficient supplies.\nMr. Speaker, I now turn to support for farmers and care homes. At first sight they do not have much in common but they are both essential to our wellbeing, are competitive within the private sector and yet need financial support if they are to produce both food and care at affordable levels and remain profitable. Furthermore farmers are in competition with foreign imports which are heavily subsidised.\nFor both industries I am introducing a public subsidy at 10% on turnover. This will be subject to a profit cap at 5% before tax to prevent profiteering by larger businesses at the expense of both taxpayer and customer. The subsidy is designed to promote sales, and the profit cap will encourage competitive pricing and support greater expenditure. Qualifying directors remuneration will be restricted. In future years the rate of subsidy will be adjusted so that no more than 5% of businesses liquidate each year.\nMany businesses in a variety of industries receive public subsidies and there has been much concern at their profits. I am therefore extending the profit cap to all entities in receipt of public subsidy, though the cap may vary according to their capital investment requirements. I am also extending it proportionately to all companies with contracts with the public sector worth annually over 10% of their turnover.\nFinally Mr. Speaker I come to the housing market. I shall be reducing house prices from now on by between 1 and 2% a year on average. This is easily done by giving the Bank of England that target and by tightening criteria such as mortgage to value and income to mortgage used by commercial lenders.\nNow you may at first sight think that would make it more difficult for prospective purchasers to find and buy a new house, but in fact that is not so. For one thing the number of available houses out there does not change, and for another the supply is likely to increase because sellers will hurry to sell before prices reduce further. More importantly developers will no longer be able to make capital gains on their land banks and so can only build houses on them and sell them. In monetary terms the reduction in demand will be matched by a reduction is prices until all available houses are sold.\nThe misconstrued Help to Buy policy has just made matters worse, so I am in effect reversing it. Last year fewer new houses were built than before the policy was introduced over ten years ago and it has just pushed house prices even higher. Irrespective of whether we can balance supply and demand, the amount of credit tied up in the housing market means that house prices are likely to remain high. Yet house prices must come down if younger people are to buy when they get married and start a family and others to escape the parental nest and develop as independent adults.\nCurrently it takes on average over five years to build out a granted planning consent whereas no so long ago it was only two. It has been reported that there are hundreds of thousands of such consents gathering dust in the pending trays of property developers because they can make more money from capital gains. But it is important to understand also that they have themselves been squeezed by increasing land prices. As a result they have endeavoured to recoup their margins by resorting to dodgy practices such as denying buyers adequate snagging periods and tying them up into leaseholds with uncontrollable ground rent increases, and generally cutting costs and building to very low standards. Many such properties are now unsaleable. Mr. Speaker I am giving Help to Buy purchasers a new six month snagging period, with a survey at taxpayer’s expense to ensure objectivity, and with all restitution costs at the sellers expense.\nMy RH friend the Secretary of State for Housing, will be carrying out a full review of planning and related procedures including the possible repeal of the 1961 Land Compensation Act which gives 100% of all planning gain to landowners. We believe it may be more appropriate to divide planning gain equally between landowners, a national development corporation with powers of compulsory purchase to focus new development in the North where there are plentiful brownfield sites available, supported by regional policy which will encourage both people and jobs to move there, and local development corporations who can use the money for local infrastructure thereby creating balanced communities. The South East is overcrowded and current development priorities just make that worse. They are levelling down not levelling up. We will protect and maintain the green belt.\nOn social housing I am restoring the full housing benefit which will become affordable again as immigration falls. This will allow housing associations access to the City for development finance, and I shall be adding a government guarantee to help reduce borrowing costs. We will continue to support Right to Buy as it does not reduce total housing available but I am halving the discounts.\nFollowing the Grenfell Tower Tragedy many leaseholders have become trapped with spiralling service charges which they cannot pay. I am therefore limiting service charge increases to inflation backdated to the date of the tragedy, and will refund landlords forced into loss by this, subject to reasonable limits on insurance premiums and other costs.\nIn summary Mr. Speaker I anticipate that for the coming year tax increases and expenditure savings with bring in around £80 billion and tax reductions and expenditure increases cost around £20 billion, giving my target net saving of £60 billion. I am also placing a five and ten year Source and Application of Funds Statement in the library and online. So now it just remains for me to I thank the House for their patience and attention during this speech. It is a budget for working people and small businesses combined with a strategy to save Britain, and I commend it to the House.",
  "https_jepoynton_com_/https_jepoynton_com_2019_01_08_supply-chains-of-corruption/content_10.html": "Since I postulated in my last post that British companies with component manufacturing supply chains on the continent may be in the pocket of Brussels, and that in turn the Conservative Party may be the recipient of donations from those companies, I have received the following list of companies, which is just a selection apparently, that have moved their manufacturing to Europe with the help of EU subsidies. I have not been able to verify this list for myself but as you will see it is very specific, and so I challenge the Prime Minister to say whether or not it is accurate.\n– Cadbury moved to Poland 2011 with an EU grant.\n– Ford Transit moved to Turkey 2013 with an EU grant.\n– Jaguar Land Rover (now a wholly owned subsidiary of Tata who mis-sold and decimated British Steel pension funds) recently agreed to build a new plant in Slovakia with an EU grant.\n– Peugeot closed its Ryton (was Rootes Group) plant and moved production to Slovakia with an EU grant.\n– The British Army’s new Ajax combat vehicles are to be built in Spain using Swedish steel, at the request of the EU, to support jobs in Spain with an EU grant, rather than Wales.\n– Crown Closures (formerly Metal Box) has been relocated to Poland with an EU grant.\n– Gillette has been relocated to Eastern Europe with an EU grant.\n– Texas Instruments, Greenock has been relocated to Germany with EU grant.\n– Sekisui Alveo’s production at its Merthyr Tydfil Industrial Park foam plant has been relocated to the Netherlands, with EU funding.\n– The Hoover Merthyr factory has been relocated to the Czech Republic and the Far East with EU backing.\n– Boots was sold to Italian Stefano Pessina who is based in Switzerland to avoid tax, using an EU loan for the purchase.\n– The Mini cars which David Cameron stood in front of to showcase British engineering, are built by BMW mostly in Holland and Austria. His campaign bus was made in Germany even though we have Plaxton, Optare, Bluebird, Dennis etc., in the UK.\nAnyone who believes the EU is good for British industry or any other business simply hasn’t paid attention to what has been systematically asset-stripped from the UK.\nI have checked this list of companies with the Conservative Party’s returns of donors on the Electoral Commission’s website. Unfortunately those results do not show anything before 1st January 2017 (why?) and there were no matches since then, but that does not mean donations could not have been laundered through some other institution. So again I challenge the Prime Minister to deny there is any connection between these two lists.\nEither way this situation is clearly appalling and unacceptable, so once again I call for the ending of all donations from institutions to registered political parties and for the introduction of modest state proportional funding as well as proportional representation. Only registered voters should be allowed to donate to registered political parties in this country.",
  "https_jepoynton_com_/https_jepoynton_com_tag_news/content_7.html": "Mr. Speaker, it is an honour and a privilege for me to have this opportunity to present to the House the government’s budget for the coming year.\nAs the House will already know, our economy and government finances are in a desperate and sorry state. Over the past nearly 25 years we have suffered a series of setbacks that have enveloped us in a perfect storm, starting with our membership of the European Union Single Market which has seen our trade balance with those countries plummet from having been broadly in balance to a deficit at the time of the Brexit Referendum of £109 billion; that’s 6% of GDP at that time. This has presented British business with a contracting market. Generally speaking business will not invest into a contracting market, with the result that productivity growth has suffered.\nThen we had the banking crisis, triggered by an oil price spike in 2007 which led to the default of many sub-prime mortgages in the USA and which our banks had invested into. But there were also collapses on this side of the pond such as Northern Rock and HBOS which were simply due to over-trading, and that can only be due to a failure of regulation here. One bright spot then arises as the banks were quickly recapitalised through the use of quantitative easing, which did not on that occasion produce inflation as it was merely replacing credit which had been destroyed in the crisis. Unfortunately later on the QE was restarted with inevitable inflationary consequences.\nOn top of all that we had austerity and the failure to start a Sovereign Wealth Fund when interest rates hit the floor. Mr. Speaker, I am sure that most members are aware that 5% compounded will quadruple your money within 30 years, and 7% double it within ten. Over the past thirty years returns on many foreign shares have been far greater than the cost of government borrowing here. That is because the rate of growth in many other countries has been far faster than it has been here and is likely to continue that way for some time to come. It must make sense for us to benefit from their success in this way. A golden opportunity completely missed.\nThen we come to Brexit which some today are blaming for all our financial woes. Mr. Speaker, I do not accept that analysis but instead that the Trade and Co-operation Agreement has locked us into the catastrophic trade deficit we inherited from the Single Market. It is not enough to secure no tariffs in either direction when there are a host of other regulations creating the imbalance, and we need the use of tariffs to counter that effect. That will almost certainly mean scrapping the TCA, and whilst trade volumes may fall, the much greater effect of import substitution will present British business at home with the expanding market they crave to invest and create productivity growth and jobs.\nFollowing that we had Covid and the energy crisis caused by the war in Ukraine, thankfully temporarily as Russia has found other outlets into the international oil markets, and all of the panic over climate change. And if that weren’t enough mass immigration, quite apart from increasing cultural conflict within the country, has condemned wages to minimum levels, undermined working conditions and caused record levels of unemployment and homelessness. And to cap it all, we have an ageing population pushing the cost of pensions and health care through the roof. Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear!\nNow, Mr. Speaker, it is not my intention to spend time trying to apportion blame for this situation. Many of these circumstances were beyond our control, and for others it is easy to be wise after the event. My purpose is to identify the causes so we can take appropriate action to remedy them and to quantify the task itself. Our National Debt is now close to 100% of GDP after having been nearly paid off a quarter of a century ago, and the cost of interest on that debt is now over £100 billion a year, nearly 4% GDP in itself, and rising. The total fiscal deficit is around £170 billion and that is adding to the Debt all the time. It is imperative, Mr. Speaker, that we get our nose ahead of the game so that we can reverse the whole process.\nMy strategy is based on three key objectives necessary to provide a tripod of stability for our recovery. First I aim to achieve a fiscal surplus of 1% GDP within five years. Second I want a trade surplus of 1% GDP by that time, and third we must achieve net zero immigration as well. Add to that some essential tax cuts to motivate growth and expenditure increases to avoid imminent collapse of some public services and we are looking at an annual fiscal turnaround of £300 billion by the end of our first five years.\nOn average I must save £60 billion in each of the next five years, but that is only on average. There are couple of policies which can raise substantial funds in excess of this amount up front, while others such as revived economic growth will be weighted towards the end. The good news is that over the following five years those trends should lead to a much greater turnaround of around £450 billion or more, with much greater scope for both tax cuts and expenditure increases, which I shall aim broadly to keep equal. I shall also aim to cut the total level of taxation down to 30% GDP, whereas currently it is around 37%, all the while maintaining fiscal and trade surpluses of 1% GDP. History shows that all the economies with the highest rates of economic growth have run Balance of Payments surpluses and I am determined the UK should be in that group.\nSo, Mr. Speaker, let me make a start.\nMy first port of call is multinational corporations, which have long had a habit of shifting their profits into tax havens, or semi tax havens such as the Republic of Ireland, to avoid corporation tax in this country. Now I accept that at 25% our rate of corporation tax is too high, and I shall return to that later, but for now may I completely reject the argument that this country must somehow engage in a race to bottom just to remain competitive. There are other ways we can regulate our trade balance, and in any case if were able to collect what is morally due to us, profits made out purchases by the good citizens of this country, that would provide the funds to reduce it.\nOver ten years ago now, the G8 at its summit in Enniskillen tasked the OECD with ending this practice.

They may be able to shift their head offices and their intellectual property rights, but they cannot shift their customers! It is difficult to forecast accurately without an established database exactly how much additional revenue this will raise, but our best estimates suggest it could be within the range of £40 to 50 billion if not more.\nSecond, Mr. Speaker, I am abolishing Inheritance Tax. It is a very inefficient tax, raising only about a third of 1% GDP; is double taxation in the hands of the deceased; uses up a disproportionate amount of tax legislation and consequently distracts the attention of thousands of lawyers and accountants who should be more constructively engaged.\nHowever I recognise that a society in which around 2% of the population own 80% of its assets is not a healthy one.

I shall therefore be instructing the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee henceforth to use a composite 4% target when setting interest rates; that is 2% inflation plus 2% job vacancies. I anticipate this will mean interest rates will remain at around the 5% mark for the foreseeable future, which is necessary anyway to encourage savings and fund investment, and will also probably be needed to contain the inflationary impact of wage rises in a tighter labour market. I shall be addressing the housing market separately in a few moments.\nIn addition I have a new regional policy designed to reduce the regional pay and unemployment gaps. It must make sense to focus stimulation to where unemployment is highest post code by post code across the country leading eventually to an even level of percentage employment across the land. This will increase income tax revenues and reduce welfare claims so it is likely to be fiscally neutral in the longer term.\nTo do so I shall cease funding new free tax and enterprise zones, which have a very chequered and uneven history, and instead introduce discounts for income tax, business rates and employers national insurance where the discount is proportionate to the local level of unemployment. For the coming year this discount will be 5% for every 1% that unemployment, measured on the claimant basis, is above 5%. We will review this algorithm annually to ensure a steady reduction in the regional gap.\nI also have a number of measures to free up the labour market to reduce structural unemployment. First I am repealing all IR35 legislation, which was designed to prevent employers avoiding the cost of national insurance contributions on permanent staff, by the simple measure of charging the invoices of self-employed and agency staff to NICs also. Professional fees will be exempt. The increased revenues will be used to reduce employers NICs for all so that the measure is fiscally neutral.\nIn any case I am immediately reducing employers NICs to 12% and increasing the minimum wage and universal credits in line with the triple lock on the state pension. I am also introducing marginal relief for employers NI with a zero alowance of £1000 per week of payroll, and a lower band of £2000 at a rate of half the full rate.\nSecond my RH friend the Work and Pensions Secretary will be undertaking a full post-implementation review of the introduction of Universal Credits with a view to making it simpler and more streamlined and efficient. In particular he will ensure that the thresholds for and rates of clawback are also universal, and that once vetted claimants do not have to reapply every time they get a gap between jobs. This is particularly important for self-employed people who currently often decline short term or low paid assignments because of the hassle and delays in reapplying.\nWithin this context I am increasing the threshold, or earnings disregard, for clawback of universal credits to £50 per week. This will create a much greater incentive for unemployed people to make that first leap back into employment, and will also allow low paid workers in the taper to keep more of what they themselves have earned. This will both reduce the poverty trap and the pressure on food banks many of which are struggling to obtain sufficient supplies.\nMr. Speaker, I now turn to support for farmers and care homes. At first sight they do not have much in common but they are both essential to our wellbeing, are competitive within the private sector and yet need financial support if they are to produce both food and care at affordable levels and remain profitable. Furthermore farmers are in competition with foreign imports which are heavily subsidised.\nFor both industries I am introducing a public subsidy at 10% on turnover. This will be subject to a profit cap at 5% before tax to prevent profiteering by larger businesses at the expense of both taxpayer and customer. The subsidy is designed to promote sales, and the profit cap will encourage competitive pricing and support greater expenditure. Qualifying directors remuneration will be restricted. In future years the rate of subsidy will be adjusted so that no more than 5% of businesses liquidate each year.\nMany businesses in a variety of industries receive public subsidies and there has been much concern at their profits. I am therefore extending the profit cap to all entities in receipt of public subsidy, though the cap may vary according to their capital investment requirements. I am also extending it proportionately to all companies with contracts with the public sector worth annually over 10% of their turnover.\nFinally Mr. Speaker I come to the housing market. I shall be reducing house prices from now on by between 1 and 2% a year on average. This is easily done by giving the Bank of England that target and by tightening criteria such as mortgage to value and income to mortgage used by commercial lenders.\nNow you may at first sight think that would make it more difficult for prospective purchasers to find and buy a new house, but in fact that is not so. For one thing the number of available houses out there does not change, and for another the supply is likely to increase because sellers will hurry to sell before prices reduce further. More importantly developers will no longer be able to make capital gains on their land banks and so can only build houses on them and sell them. In monetary terms the reduction in demand will be matched by a reduction is prices until all available houses are sold.\nThe misconstrued Help to Buy policy has just made matters worse, so I am in effect reversing it. Last year fewer new houses were built than before the policy was introduced over ten years ago and it has just pushed house prices even higher. Irrespective of whether we can balance supply and demand, the amount of credit tied up in the housing market means that house prices are likely to remain high. Yet house prices must come down if younger people are to buy when they get married and start a family and others to escape the parental nest and develop as independent adults.\nCurrently it takes on average over five years to build out a granted planning consent whereas no so long ago it was only two. It has been reported that there are hundreds of thousands of such consents gathering dust in the pending trays of property developers because they can make more money from capital gains. But it is important to understand also that they have themselves been squeezed by increasing land prices. As a result they have endeavoured to recoup their margins by resorting to dodgy practices such as denying buyers adequate snagging periods and tying them up into leaseholds with uncontrollable ground rent increases, and generally cutting costs and building to very low standards. Many such properties are now unsaleable. Mr. Speaker I am giving Help to Buy purchasers a new six month snagging period, with a survey at taxpayer’s expense to ensure objectivity, and with all restitution costs at the sellers expense.\nMy RH friend the Secretary of State for Housing, will be carrying out a full review of planning and related procedures including the possible repeal of the 1961 Land Compensation Act which gives 100% of all planning gain to landowners. We believe it may be more appropriate to divide planning gain equally between landowners, a national development corporation with powers of compulsory purchase to focus new development in the North where there are plentiful brownfield sites available, supported by regional policy which will encourage both people and jobs to move there, and local development corporations who can use the money for local infrastructure thereby creating balanced communities. The South East is overcrowded and current development priorities just make that worse. They are levelling down not levelling up. We will protect and maintain the green belt.\nOn social housing I am restoring the full housing benefit which will become affordable again as immigration falls. This will allow housing associations access to the City for development finance, and I shall be adding a government guarantee to help reduce borrowing costs. We will continue to support Right to Buy as it does not reduce total housing available but I am halving the discounts.\nFollowing the Grenfell Tower Tragedy many leaseholders have become trapped with spiralling service charges which they cannot pay. I am therefore limiting service charge increases to inflation backdated to the date of the tragedy, and will refund landlords forced into loss by this, subject to reasonable limits on insurance premiums and other costs.\nIn summary Mr. Speaker I anticipate that for the coming year tax increases and expenditure savings with bring in around £80 billion and tax reductions and expenditure increases cost around £20 billion, giving my target net saving of £60 billion. I am also placing a five and ten year Source and Application of Funds Statement in the library and online. So now it just remains for me to I thank the House for their patience and attention during this speech. It is a budget for working people and small businesses combined with a strategy to save Britain, and I commend it to the House.",

What he did say was that the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has forecast the creation of 1 million new jobs over the next five years. What neither he nor the OBR added however is that, on the basis of current trends, we will by then have 2 million more new immigrants. Simply deducting one figure from the other shows how net unemployment will increase.

What we are not told is how the rich are once again surging ahead at the expense of the poor.\nFor a fuller analysis of the budget please see my blog article here, and on Welfare reform here.\nWheelie Bins\nHot topic in Ealing just at the moment. But how many of you realise that in fact you don’t have any choice in the matter anyway? It is the result of an EU Directive (No. 2008/98, which you can read here if you are a masochist) which requires every council to recycle at least 50% of your waste. This can only be achieved with wheelie bins, so that you can sort your ex-stuff out for them. You might get some influence over the time of collection, or even the size of the bins, but what you can’t avoid is having to sort your waste. And that requires multiple bins. Thought you lived in a democracy? You don’t. You just have to do as you’re told.\nSo if you want to go back to living in a democracy there is only one action that should achieve this – voting OUT in the forthcoming referendum.\nExecutive Pay: A closed market.\nThe perennial problem of excessive executive pay is raising its ugly head again, this time as regards the BBC and NHS.\nNow I am a capitalist in the mould of Adam Smith, who observed that capitalism is only of benefit to society if it is contained within a strong framework of law, both to control fraud and prevent deceit, and to ensure open competitive markets. It is open competition which ensures profits not profiteering, and these are the constraints which make capitalism a form of socialism.\nYet these days executive recruitment is entirely conducted behind closed doors by head-hunters. It is a closed shop. We don’t tolerate closed shops from the Unions, so why should we do so from head-hunters? You can find a broader discussion of the situation on my blog here. In essence I am proposing the introduction of a procedure I call Cheapest Competent Candidate. At it’s simplest it would require all recruiters for positions above a certain pay level, in the public sector at first but ultimately in Company Law for public companies as well, to produce a short-list of at least five names, and then to require each of them to bid for the job just as you would do with a contractor, appointing the lowest bidder.\nObvious, isn’t it?\nGreece: The Dance of the Dunces.\nWe all of us I am sure have the greatest sympathy for the Greeks in their current predicament. So it has been with considerable frustration that I have watched the negotiators on each side make such a pig’s ear of sorting it out.\nOf course Nigel Farage is absolutely right to say that the best solution for Greece is to abandon the euro and leave the European Union. However we have to accept that, for the present at least, the democratic wish of the vast majority of Greeks is to keep both. So the question arises: was there any other way they could have agreed a constructive way forward? I believe there was and still could be, and I described it more fully on my blog here.\nThose of you who read my election address will recall how I castigated the Coalition for not setting up a Sovereign Wealth Fund to hedge our own national debt. Here we have an even more critical situation where one side wants to write off the debt and the other doesn’t. Hedging it could satisfy both.\nClearly this was a case for Economic Superman. Trouble was, nobody beamed me up! Ok I know that sounds a bit superior but honestly, when you are forced to watch a fiasco such as this, how else can you feel?\nCalais: Global Migration into Europe and the UK.\nThey can’t come here. And they can’t go back. So simple logic tells us they must be provided for somewhere else in a secure and decently run refugee camp. So what have our glorious politicians done about it? Absolutely nothing.\nNow I have never visited the Falklands so I could be mistaken, but at first sight they would appear to make an ideal location for such a refugee camp. The west or south islands in particular. A long way from the UK. Because they are secure and under British sovereignty we could make sure the camp is properly set up and run. Of course it will be expensive, but not half as expensive as any acceptable alternative, and it could be paid for, pro-tem at least, out of our overseas aid budget. Nor do we have to wait for the EU to sort itself out. We can get on with it unilaterally and immediately. Both genuine refugees and economic migrants to the UK could go there straight from Calais or wherever they are found, with the paperwork and appeals sorted out after they arrive. They could be given a small allowance to enable a local in-camp economy to develop which would, through trade, be of benefit to the islanders as well. They would eventually be taken back directly to their home countries, with new passports obtained for them where necessary, when they themselves decided they wanted to go.\nSo what are we waiting for?\nThe coming Referendum Campaign.\nIt is now clear that the OUT campaign will involve many disparate and well funded groups, of which UKIP is but one. You can read how our effort is coming along here. Do please consider making a contribution. This is YOUR future we are talking about. Watch out for future newsletters tackling in detail the issues involved.\nUKIP is onto a winner either way. If the referendum is successful then our raison d’etre is fulfilled and we can all go home. If not it will leave UKIP as the ONLY remaining route out of the EU and our support will rocket. There would then be a real chance of UKIP filling the vacuum left by Labour and the LibDems as the only competent left-of-centre alternative to the Tories.\nOur Values: Reflections on my 2015 General Election campaign.\nI have a confession to make. I was over-confident. And as a result lost my deposit. Not what I expected at all. Even so, everyone else thought 4.1% was good going. My mistake was to get distracted for a few days by family matters; not to send an article to the Ealing Gazette like the other candidates; and missing one important hustings. Also if I had canvassed the Southall Green ward, which I hardly touched, as thoroughly as Southall Broadway, where I personally delivered a leaflet to every house and had many street conversations, and where most of my votes came from, I would probably have reached 8 or even 10%. Ah well, as my mother never ceased to tell me, pride comes before a fall. Whether having had some helpers and a budget of more than £1500 would have made any difference I am not so sure. Personal contact was everything.\nI was also disappointed not to be offered a closing speech at the declaration. So for the record here is what I would have said:\n“Well, it was not to be. Even so it has been a pleasure and a privilege for me these last few weeks to meet so many of you as I have canvassed around, and I can only regret that I managed to cover so little, about a quarter, of the constituency in all. Most of you I found to be open-minded and genuinely interested to discover for yourselves what UKIP stands for, and on the odd occasion where that was not so I was glad of the opportunity to correct some of the misconceptions that appear to have arisen about us.\nWe are of course a multi-ethnic, multi-class one-nation libertarian party. We believe that all races, all colours, all creeds and all faiths should be treated equally. We do not condone discrimination of any kind, positive or negative, and believe that selection should always be based on merit alone. We see ourselves as a left-of-centre progressive party with an agenda not only to create greater fairness and equality of opportunity in society, but also with a passion to re-establish Britain’s independence, her freedom to create her own laws, and to have a government that is accountable only to the British people and to no-one else.\nListening to the television coverage as it has unfolded this evening, it now seems that we shall have a small majority Conservative government. And whilst I share with you many reservations about that, I do rejoice that now, almost certainly, we shall get a referendum on Britain’s future independence from the European Union. I look forward to that campaign, and in particular to the opportunity to have a debate about the future of our country free I hope from the divisive party loyalties and prejudices that so often disfigure political discourse in this country.\nLet us now come together as one nation, and as one society, to make this momentous constitutional decision. I am confident that the British people, including of course all of us here in Ealing Southall, will have the courage to stand up for our country, for her freedom and for her independence, as valiantly as any previous generation. Of course there will be the nay-sayers, and the appeasers, including much of big business, too timid to countenance any change at all. But we shall expose their bland assertions, and their lazy assumptions, and establish beyond all reasonable doubt the case for leaving the European Union.\nSo until then it only leaves me now to thank all of you who have made this election today run as smoothly as it has, to congratulate Mr. Sharma on his emphatic victory, and to wish all of you good night, such as is left of it, and god bless.”\nIncidentally, you may be wondering where I am in this photo of the declaration platform published by the Ealing Gazette? So am I! As I recall Mrs. Sharma was standing close by her husband’s left shoulder, and I was close next to her. We both appear to have been airbrushed out! Ve-ry in-ter-est-ing! I shall leave you to draw your own conclusions.\nNew UKIP Ealing Website\nOur local party covers the three constituencies Ealing Southall, Ealing North and Ealing Central and Acton, and our joint website is being updated in advance of the referendum campaign.

  "https_jepoynton_com_/https_jepoynton_com_2015_08_04_breeding-for-benefits-and-welfare-reform/content_66.html": "Just as Iain Duncan-Smith jumped for joy when he heard during the budget speech that the minimum wage, now aka the living wage, is to be increased, so also I jumped for joy to hear that child tax credits were being cut back. Until, that is, I realised Osborne was going to do it in one go rather than phase it in so that no-one would be worse off overnight. He could have done that by applying the cuts only to new-borns. However his actions did make me wonder if he had seen copies of an exchange of letters I had had with IDS, via my MP Cheryl Gillan, a couple of years ago when I asked for details of the breeding rates for families claiming benefits compared to those not doing so.\nIn that exchange IDS drew my attention to some DWP statistics released in response to an FOI request. They are available on the DWP website here. They show that for all families on benefits 23% have three or more children. Separately in his covering letter he stated that on average for all families only 14% have three or more children. If you then pro-rate the figures you can calculate that for all families not on benefits only 11.5% have three or more children. In other words families on benefits are breeding at double the rate of families not on benefits. However he had not analysed the numbers in this way and had therefore missed their significance and message. I wrote back to say so.\nHigh breeding rates, particularly amongst the poor, are as much a burden to this country as high immigration rates, and it is not difficult to see why this has occurred. Child poverty is an emotive subject, and weak politicians are always prone to buying a few votes by increasing child benefits, allowances or tax credits, allowing the provision to become bloated and disproportionate. Further, the definition of child poverty adopted by New Labour, which was set as a percentage of average family incomes, included a built in escalator as standards of living rose. Paradoxically the recession has reversed this process, so that apparently fewer children are now in poverty by this measure as a result, which is absurd. I noted that George Osborne could not resist saying that child poverty had fallen in recent years – without saying how he was measuring that!\nThe government’s separately announced intention to review the basis on which child poverty is measured is welcome, but we must be careful what we are looking at. Clearly some parents are simply creaming off some of these benefits for themselves, leaving their children no better off, else why would we get these results? Parents are primarily responsible for their children, and the state should only intervene where there is clear evidence of deprivation or danger. A much more targeted, evidence-based and non-financial approach is required. Indeed, the emergence of food banks is an admirable example of the ‘big society’ in action, and their use should be encouraged for families who insist on having more children while they are claiming benefits.\nOsborne has now acted to remove this perverse incentive, though in my opinion, as mentioned above, he should have withdrawn the benefits only for children not yet born. He could also have attenuated the benefits for each subsequent child after the first to reflect the fact that it is cheaper to live in a large family than a small one, and he could have offset the cost to working families by increasing the earnings disregards for Universal Credit clawback. Indeed welfare payments are a key component of consumer demand which should be maintained during a recession to help reduce unemployment. His actions may well cause unemployment to rise, as well as create a political backlash, and thereby cause the deficit actually to increase. Only after unemployment has fallen, which in itself will help to reduce welfare costs, should structural reductions be undertaken, and a focus on children not yet born would be consistent with this. In addition he has not acted to make work pay, despite the rhetoric to the contrary, and he is also completely at sea on housing.\nMaking work pay is all about sticks and carrots. You need both, but with the carrots being generally available and the sticks only being used where there is wilful non-cooperation. This government seems to think that it is simply about starving people into work. It is not. There will always be some unemployment. There has to be or else the economy will seize up and inflation go through the roof. So what are those unemployed people to live on? I am a strong supporter of the welfare system and believe it to be as much an icon of our civilized way of life as the NHS. However if the structure of it is not right then the incentive effects are perverse. As far as making work pay is concerned this means a big increase in the earnings disregards before clawback is calculated. That way you can say to people that the first £75 per week, say, that they earn will not be subject to any deductions at all. To someone on benefits that is worth getting out of bed for, even if they are only making a few pounds in a part-time or low-paid job. Whereas Osborne has done precisely the opposite and reduced the disregards. Even the Institute for Fiscal Studies was flummoxed by that one, and said so.\nAnd then came this. “Mr Deputy Speaker, we are also going to end the ratchet of ever higher housing benefit chasing up ever higher rents in the social housing sector. These rents have increased by a staggering 20% since 2010. So rents paid in the social housing sector will not be frozen, but reduced by 1% a year for the next four years.” My mouth fell open. As an intervention into the workings of the free market this was every bit as economically illiterate as Ed Miliband’s frozen energy prices! He knows perfectly well why rents have gone through the roof. It is due to a combination of unlimited immigration and failure to build the new homes required. Supply and demand. Reducing rents by intervention is only going to reduce the supply still further.\nAnd if that wasn’t bad enough he then went on to say “I’m confident that Housing Associations and other landlords in the social sector will be able to play their part and deliver the efficiency savings needed.” If that isn’t ostrich behaviour I don’t know what is. As Finance Director of one of London’s largest housing associations back in the 1980’s I can tell you exactly what is going to happen. Small and relatively inexpensive maintenance jobs will be botched or ignored. The property will then deteriorate further until it becomes an expensive major repair. The tenants will be decanted because the property is no longer habitable, but the property will remain empty, deteriorating at an accelerated rate, because the funds aren’t available to do anything about it. Finally it will be sold off at auction at a fraction of its original value. Brilliant!\nSo what I would have liked to have seen is the savings from fully phasing out the tax credits system, which is an unnecessary duplication, some £30bn a year, split and used three ways: to reduce the deficit in due course, to increase the disregards, and to increase the provision for housing benefit.\nGiven the massive shortage of social housing I also propose the introduction of a flat-rate cash allowance of perhaps £100 pw for people who qualify for housing benefit but cannot claim it because there is no social housing available. This would give them the opportunity to escape the dependency culture and make their own arrangements pro-tem – lodgings, hostels, tents, caravans, whatever – on an either/or basis with universal credits.\nMore thought should be given to the transition from benefits to tax. They are of course two completely different systems, not least in that benefits are family based whereas tax is not. That cannot easily be changed, but at least for single adults if the UC living allowance is set at a quarter of the personal tax allowance, the same amount for the disregard, and the clawback rate at 33.3%, then the top of the clawback taper would exactly coincide with the personal tax allowance, giving a completely smooth transition from 33.3% to 20% deductions. So for example for a personal tax allowance of £15,600pa, ie £300pw, you would get a living allowance and disregard both of £75, which is broadly the same as the current JSA allowance. This would optimize incentives to find work and progress up the income ladder whilst at the same time providing reasonable income support, sufficient for healthy survival, for the completely unemployed and underemployed.\nTwo further problems are apparent – the disproportionate rate of tax paid by the poorest (mainly through VAT), and the difficulty of ensuring adequate and progressive provision for the self-employed.\nIncreasing the personal tax allowance to £15,600 would represent an increase of £4,600, which would be very expensive. However it could be brought in with a corresponding increase in the basic rate of tax to 25%. This is not as drastic as it may sound. The break-even point is £34,000 on these assumptions – anyone earning less than this would be better off. One could then introduce an intermediate rate of 35% starting at £45,000 (currently 40% starts at £43,000 – you would be paying an extra £450 in tax at that point), and a top rate of 45% from say £75,000 (currently £150,000), eliminating the 40% rate altogether and creating a much more progressive burden.\nIn recent years increasing numbers have become self-employed, either by choice or as a result of welfare sanctions, yet we have no idea whether they are working the number of hours that want or earning a decent living. My solution is a self-assessed living allowance, the same as JSA at £75 per week for a single person, but automatically payable for two months (£324 per month) if claimed by someone registered as self-employed. At the end of the first month an online return of hours worked and income earned would have to be submitted to release the allowance for the third month, and so on. Further the benefit would automatically be adjusted on the basis of the income reported so that it can be reduced as appropriate on a cumulative basis throughout the year. At the year-end a final assessment would take place and any adjustment paid. There returns would then give us the information we need to determine accurately the actual level of underemployment for the purposes of fiscal policy. It would also allow small business owners to manage their drawings so as not to put their cash-flow at risk.\nIn summary therefore I recommend the following 6 point plan:\n- Phase out the tax credit system, thereby saving over £30bn a year; working tax credits immediately (see below for replacement) and child tax credits phased out over 18 years by not registering any additional children.\n- Attenuate the Universal Credit child allowances by 10% for each additional child after the first.\n- Increase the UC earnings disregard to £75 per earner and reduce the clawback rate to 33.33%.\n- Increase the personal tax allowance to £15,600, and the basic rate to 25%\n- Introduce a homeless allowance for anyone qualifying for housing benefit but who cannot claim it.\n- Introduce an online self-assessed living allowance for the self-employed.",

It is the result of an EU Directive (No. 2008/98, which you can read here if you are a masochist) which requires every council to recycle at least 50% of your waste. This can only be achieved with wheelie bins, so that you can sort your ex-stuff out for them. You might get some influence over the time of collection, or even the size of the bins, but what you can’t avoid is having to sort your waste. And that requires multiple bins. Thought you lived in a democracy? You don’t. You just have to do as you’re told.\nSo if you want to go back to living in a democracy there is only one action that should achieve this – voting OUT in the forthcoming referendum.\nExecutive Pay: A closed market.\nThe perennial problem of excessive executive pay is raising its ugly head again, this time as regards the BBC and NHS.\nNow I am a capitalist in the mould of Adam Smith, who observed that capitalism is only of benefit to society if it is contained within a strong framework of law, both to control fraud and prevent deceit, and to ensure open competitive markets. It is open competition which ensures profits not profiteering, and these are the constraints which make capitalism a form of socialism.\nYet these days executive recruitment is entirely conducted behind closed doors by head-hunters. It is a closed shop. We don’t tolerate closed shops from the Unions, so why should we do so from head-hunters? You can find a broader discussion of the situation on my blog here. In essence I am proposing the introduction of a procedure I call Cheapest Competent Candidate. At it’s simplest it would require all recruiters for positions above a certain pay level, in the public sector at first but ultimately in Company Law for public companies as well, to produce a short-list of at least five names, and then to require each of them to bid for the job just as you would do with a contractor, appointing the lowest bidder.\nObvious, isn’t it?\nGreece: The Dance of the Dunces.\nWe all of us I am sure have the greatest sympathy for the Greeks in their current predicament. So it has been with considerable frustration that I have watched the negotiators on each side make such a pig’s ear of sorting it out.\nOf course Nigel Farage is absolutely right to say that the best solution for Greece is to abandon the euro and leave the European Union. However we have to accept that, for the present at least, the democratic wish of the vast majority of Greeks is to keep both. So the question arises: was there any other way they could have agreed a constructive way forward? I believe there was and still could be, and I described it more fully on my blog here.\nThose of you who read my election address will recall how I castigated the Coalition for not setting up a Sovereign Wealth Fund to hedge our own national debt. Here we have an even more critical situation where one side wants to write off the debt and the other doesn’t. Hedging it could satisfy both.\nClearly this was a case for Economic Superman. Trouble was, nobody beamed me up! Ok I know that sounds a bit superior but honestly, when you are forced to watch a fiasco such as this, how else can you feel?\nCalais: Global Migration into Europe and the UK.\nThey can’t come here. And they can’t go back. So simple logic tells us they must be provided for somewhere else in a secure and decently run refugee camp. So what have our glorious politicians done about it? Absolutely nothing.\nNow I have never visited the Falklands so I could be mistaken, but at first sight they would appear to make an ideal location for such a refugee camp. The west or south islands in particular. A long way from the UK. Because they are secure and under British sovereignty we could make sure the camp is properly set up and run. Of course it will be expensive, but not half as expensive as any acceptable alternative, and it could be paid for, pro-tem at least, out of our overseas aid budget. Nor do we have to wait for the EU to sort itself out. We can get on with it unilaterally and immediately. Both genuine refugees and economic migrants to the UK could go there straight from Calais or wherever they are found, with the paperwork and appeals sorted out after they arrive. They could be given a small allowance to enable a local in-camp economy to develop which would, through trade, be of benefit to the islanders as well. They would eventually be taken back directly to their home countries, with new passports obtained for them where necessary, when they themselves decided they wanted to go.\nSo what are we waiting for?\nThe coming Referendum Campaign.\nIt is now clear that the OUT campaign will involve many disparate and well funded groups, of which UKIP is but one. You can read how our effort is coming along here. Do please consider making a contribution. This is YOUR future we are talking about. Watch out for future newsletters tackling in detail the issues involved.\nUKIP is onto a winner either way. If the referendum is successful then our raison d’etre is fulfilled and we can all go home. If not it will leave UKIP as the ONLY remaining route out of the EU and our support will rocket. There would then be a real chance of UKIP filling the vacuum left by Labour and the LibDems as the only competent left-of-centre alternative to the Tories.\nOur Values: Reflections on my 2015 General Election campaign.\nI have a confession to make. I was over-confident. And as a result lost my deposit. Not what I expected at all. Even so, everyone else thought 4.1% was good going. My mistake was to get distracted for a few days by family matters; not to send an article to the Ealing Gazette like the other candidates; and missing one important hustings. Also if I had canvassed the Southall Green ward, which I hardly touched, as thoroughly as Southall Broadway, where I personally delivered a leaflet to every house and had many street conversations, and where most of my votes came from, I would probably have reached 8 or even 10%. Ah well, as my mother never ceased to tell me, pride comes before a fall. Whether having had some helpers and a budget of more than £1500 would have made any difference I am not so sure. Personal contact was everything.\nI was also disappointed not to be offered a closing speech at the declaration. So for the record here is what I would have said:\n“Well, it was not to be. Even so it has been a pleasure and a privilege for me these last few weeks to meet so many of you as I have canvassed around, and I can only regret that I managed to cover so little, about a quarter, of the constituency in all. Most of you I found to be open-minded and genuinely interested to discover for yourselves what UKIP stands for, and on the odd occasion where that was not so I was glad of the opportunity to correct some of the misconceptions that appear to have arisen about us.\nWe are of course a multi-ethnic, multi-class one-nation libertarian party. We believe that all races, all colours, all creeds and all faiths should be treated equally. We do not condone discrimination of any kind, positive or negative, and believe that selection should always be based on merit alone. We see ourselves as a left-of-centre progressive party with an agenda not only to create greater fairness and equality of opportunity in society, but also with a passion to re-establish Britain’s independence, her freedom to create her own laws, and to have a government that is accountable only to the British people and to no-one else.\nListening to the television coverage as it has unfolded this evening, it now seems that we shall have a small majority Conservative government. And whilst I share with you many reservations about that, I do rejoice that now, almost certainly, we shall get a referendum on Britain’s future independence from the European Union. I look forward to that campaign, and in particular to the opportunity to have a debate about the future of our country free I hope from the divisive party loyalties and prejudices that so often disfigure political discourse in this country.\nLet us now come together as one nation, and as one society, to make this momentous constitutional decision. I am confident that the British people, including of course all of us here in Ealing Southall, will have the courage to stand up for our country, for her freedom and for her independence, as valiantly as any previous generation. Of course there will be the nay-sayers, and the appeasers, including much of big business, too timid to countenance any change at all. But we shall expose their bland assertions, and their lazy assumptions, and establish beyond all reasonable doubt the case for leaving the European Union.\nSo until then it only leaves me now to thank all of you who have made this election today run as smoothly as it has, to congratulate Mr. Sharma on his emphatic victory, and to wish all of you good night, such as is left of it, and god bless.”\nIncidentally, you may be wondering where I am in this photo of the declaration platform published by the Ealing Gazette? So am I! As I recall Mrs. Sharma was standing close by her husband’s left shoulder, and I was close next to her. We both appear to have been airbrushed out! Ve-ry in-ter-est-ing! I shall leave you to draw your own conclusions.\nNew UKIP Ealing Website\nOur local party covers the three constituencies Ealing Southall, Ealing North and Ealing Central and Acton, and our joint website is being updated in advance of the referendum campaign. You can find it here.\nWith best wishes to you all\nJohn Poynton BSc. FCA FIMC\nUKIP Parliamentary Candidate for Ealing Southall 2015\nhttp://jepoynton.com",
  "https_jepoynton_com_/https_jepoynton_com_2015_02_07_threats-to-and-nature-of-our-free-society/content_48.html": "Several events recently have caused me to reflect upon the nature of our free society and the way it is under threat from various quarters, including of course from our membership of the European Union. For example Lord Freud’s attempts to address the serious issue of finding work for the disabled, the assassinations at Charlie Hebdo, the phenomenon of internet trolling, the private members bill to make permanent a commitment to spend 0.7% of taxpayers’ money on overseas aid; and there is also Lord Leveson’s recommendations on privacy to consider.\nThe French have now suffered for over two centuries from Napoleonic Law, a highly proscriptive form of law which says in effect that you cannot do anything unless the law explicitly permits it. It is a form of law that has spread widely across the continent and which now forms the principle mind-set pervading the European Union. Different nationalities react to it in different ways, so for example the Germans meekly do whatever they are told, whereas the French invariably try to do the opposite.\nEither way it is now being imposed on us through European Law. It’s effect is to treat adults like children which, as we all remember from the old adage, means that sooner or later they all start behaving like children. Even the most fleeting glance across the Channel will confirm what I mean, whether it be at the sight of farmers tipping lorry-loads of tomatoes on motorways, or the nature of the cartoons in Charlie Hebdo. I base the latter observation on Christopher Booker’s recent article in the Sunday Telegraph in which he reports that most cartoons the magazine publishes contain little or no satirical content whatsoever. Instead they use ‘freedom of speech’ to justify the publication of purely gratuitous provocation at any passing figure of authority, like teenagers pushing their boundaries to see what they can get away with.\nEnglish and Scottish law on the other hand approaches matters from the other end of the spectrum, saying that you are trusted to exercise adult moral responsibility except in regard to certain activities which must be proscribed in the interests of maintaining public order. As a result we have been brought up to exercise moral responsibility voluntarily using our own individual discretion, and because most of us do so it works.\nEuropean Law is toxic to our British concept of a free society. If we become infected with it our culture will perish and we will all end up behaving like the French. Once gone it will be almost impossible to revive, as it is was accumulated over generations. It is one of the most powerful reasons to leave the European Union.\nI suggest that the core principle here is not ‘freedom of speech’ but the ‘pursuit of truth’. As a result we expect our cartoons to make a serious point, albeit at the expense of passing figures of authority. Of course freedom of speech is essential to enable us to pursue the truth, but unfortunately it doesn’t follow that the reverse is true. Freedom of speech does not necessarily require the pursuit of truth. Freedom of speech is therefore a means to an end rather that an end in itself. It lies very much in that part of the domain of morality which we in UKIP, as British libertarians, leave to the discretion of the individual.\nTo us ‘small government’ means not only a small fiscal public sector and consequent low taxation but also restricting the scope of the law to what is necessary to maintain public order and to provide essential public services. I would myself say that the law is there to protect us from harm or loss at the hands of third parties and in our dealings with second parties, but it is not there to protect us from our own choices in life, provided of course we do not cause harm or loss to others in the process, and nor is it there to coerce us into patterns of behaviour which are purely of convenience to the state.\nThe value judgements of the majority often conflict. If you ask everyone if they want lower taxes they will say yes. But if at the same time you ask whether more should be spent on public services they will again say yes! I call these value judgement conflicts ‘technical issues’, the technicality here being that you cannot vote for two and two to equal five. It is theoretically the role of representative government, our MPs in Parliament, to sort out these technicalities on our behalf, though it is a moot point whether many of them are up to the task. What it does do is make the case for a written constitution in which the scope of the law is limited, as well as support UKIP’s commitment to greater use of referenda.\nAnyway, how do we deal with the subject of causing offence when cartoons, or remarks such as Lord Freud’s, do have a serious content? I suggest that in such cases the pursuit of truth should always prevail, since that is the core value upon which our entire civilisation is based. If anyone is offended in the process then tough. We all get offended at times. It is not fatal and we should just deal with it as and when it occurs.\nWe thus end up with three types of offence, the first being where it incites criminal behaviour, and should therefore itself be a criminal offence; the second being purely gratuitous provocation which although it does not in itself cause any harm or loss to others I unhesitatingly condemn as immoral; and the third the by-product of the pursuit of truth, which I defend.\nSo where do internet trolls fit into this picture? Of course if they cause actual harm or loss to those they bully, including self-harm or worse, then that is a crime in itself and the question of causing offence is superseded. But suppose the same abuse is directed at another and did not have those results, is that immoral but lying outside the scope of the law? I would suggest so. The disincentive lies in the fact that the troller cannot tell how his target will react. Repetitive abuse could be prosecuted as harassment. It follows that all trolls must be identifiable so that they can be held to account.\nAs an atheist I am free to base my moral values on the assessment of consequences, whereas all religions, so far as I know, take a predetermined approach, saying that it is always right to do this and always wrong to do that, which of course has the advantages of clarity and enforceability. In theory this should result in conflict, but strangely in practice it rarely does. This is probably because those who drew up the original religious codes did exactly the same thing, and were acting in an environment where the rule of law for the protection of the people was virtually unknown. Clarity and enforceability were central to success. The same situation prevails today in poorer parts of the world, which must be one of the main strengths of Islam.\nIn this country however our modern systems of justice take over the tasks of providing clarity and enforceability. This highlights the role of uncertainty in the pursuit of moral truth, just as Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle highlights the role of uncertainty in the pursuit of natural truth. The individual facing a moral decision will usually be in a far better position to assess the likely consequences of their action, which will depend as much on circumstance as on the nature of the act itself. The future is always inherently uncertain, and a generalised law cannot possible predict or take into account all the possible sets of circumstances that can arise.\nIn other words the law can ‘get it wrong’. The true value of our free society therefore lies in the opportunity it gives us as individuals to ‘get it right’ more often. Moreover, even when the results of our actions have become apparent, we will still never know what the results of any alternative courses of action open to us would have been. Think of the SAS in Gibraltar for example; whether to take out the IRA terrorists who might be about to set off a bomb in a crowded place, or definitely avoid causing the deaths of those terrorists. Both results are morally wrong, but it is impossible to know what they are at the time of decision, or indeed both of them ever. On the spot judgement is crucial to reducing the risks involved.\nA further dimension arises in a multicultural society where many different moral codes are used. This situation likewise argues for the law to be kept to the lowest common denominator consistent with maintaining public order.\nIn examining the nature of the pursuit of truth, can we learn anything from the transition from ‘classical physics’ to ‘modern physics’. Modern physics does not replace classical physics; it merely says that when you go beyond a certain boundary of experience, such as matter moving close to the speed of light or the interaction of subatomic particles/waves, then the classical laws break down and you have to think again and find a deeper, more general theory. Might not we be facing a similar transition in morality where modern life throws up situations which lie well beyond the limits of classical experience?\nThis all argues for as much flexibility as possible; not a virtue of the European Union. I was delighted to see that Parliament has now approved the use of genetic modification to combat mitochondrial disease. Critics pointed to the risks involved, but you can never eliminate risk altogether. Life is about managing risk, not eliminating it, and clearly in this case the risks of not intervening greatly outweigh those of doing so.\nThe management of risk also affects the use of preventive law. Strictly speaking any intervention to prevent a crime is an act of prejudice and we therefore have to be very careful how we allow it. The principal role of the police is to bring to justice those who have committed crimes, not to prevent them in the first place. If you gave the police carte blanche to prevent crime you would end up with a police state, as well as intolerable pressure on and impossible expectations of the police themselves. We appear to have such a situation already with social workers and child adoption. It’s not fair on our public servants apart from anything else. What I do expect from the police is that they maintain a high degree of vigilance; that they intervene where they have clear evidence that a crime is imminent or in progress; and that they bring criminals to justice as efficiently as possible.\nDoes deterrence work? This is impossible to measure as you cannot count the number of crimes that have been deterred. Common sense and personal experience tells us that it does work for the vast majority of law abiding citizens, but may have less effect on those who have already crossed the Rubicon into criminality. What we do with criminal offenders is a whole new subject, but much depends on the wealth of the country. A poor society has little option but to administer capital or corporal punishment, whereas a richer one can afford more rehabilitation. It is necessary also to distinguish between the verdict and the sentence. Thus with drug use I would advise it remains a criminal offence (the verdict) but that sentencing should be directed at rehabilitation. The apparent confluence of verdict and sentence under Sharia Law is I am sure one of the chief sources of confusion between the communities.\nIn some cases there is a clear statistical relationship between harm and preventive laws, such as with speed limits and drink driving regulations for example or with crowd control. So I can accept them in such circumstances. The situation becomes more confused though when you consider that there is a much wider range of possible causes for any crash, such as the inexperience, medical condition or emotional state of the driver, and that speeding and drink-driving are commonplace without incident. Harsher sentencing for actually causing harm or loss can be an alternative to regulation.\nLikewise we must always remember that the law of diminishing returns applies. You can no more eliminate risk than achieve the speed of light. The cost or energy required to do so is infinite, so we must accept that a line must be drawn somewhere short of it. I feel much more comfortable with a line that respects the judgement of the individual, even though occasionally mistakes will be made. The same sort of thing happens with food sell-by dates. The level of waste resulting from over-tight labelling is mind-boggling across all income levels. At our house we hardly ever throw out food, making good use of the freezer both before and after meals. I wonder if any research has been done on the sensitivity of food poisoning to sell-by date?\nAs I write, reports are coming in (as yet unchecked) of a UKIP NEC decision to impose stunning in abattoirs, thereby contravening the religious beliefs certainly of the Jewish community and possibly of the Muslim community as well. This seems to me to contradict both our philosophy on the nature of a free society and UKIP’s own manifesto commitment to allow greater use of local referenda. Such referenda will only work if they add to existing law on a local bye-law basis, as clearly we cannot allow them to overturn the law of the land or we would end up with anarchy. So it follows that national law should remain restricted and silent on issues of social and religious conscience. Local referenda could then be used in those parts of the country that do wish to require stunning, without thereby creating any conflict with national law. There is no need for uniformity across the land on such matters. Surely the whole point of local government is that it allows different communities to be different. The NEC have got this one the wrong way round.\nWe have also approached the issue of overseas aid on this basis, so this new policy is inconsistent with that as well. By no stretch of the imagination could overseas aid be described as essential to the maintenance of public order within the UK! It is virtually a contradiction in terms; a ‘reductio ad absurdum’. A further reason to leave overseas aid to the charitable sector is that there is very little national interest in it; it is almost entirely a matter of social conscience. Thus UKIP’s objection to spending public money on overseas aid is based on principle as well as being a matter of sound public housekeeping. John Stuart Mill must be turning in his grave at the sight of the LibDems proposing a permanent commitment to 0.7% of GDP spent from public funds on overseas aid. Such a policy is neither Liberal nor is it Democratic!\nEither way it now leaves UKIP as the only valid inheritor of the Whig political tradition in this country. We are certainly not ‘right-wing’. This term comes from the French Revolution to describe the Bourgeoisie, who sat on the right side of the new National Assembly and who believed that inequality was part of the natural order of things and should be left alone. UKIP on the other hand supports the minimum wage and the provision of decent public services and of a reliable welfare system based on the safety net principle. One could argue in fact that UKIP now lies to the left of both the Conservatives, on account of their failure to protect those in greatest need, and Labour, on account of its continued support of the European Union, and hence of immigration, thereby undermining both our living standards and employment prospects and pushing up our rents.\nSo the question of where you draw the line between the law and individual freedom, including freedom of speech, is a tricky one, but I do conclude that it is a matter of maintaining public order rather than one of free speech. After all other freedoms are restricted in the name of public order, so why not self-expression? The question must arise therefore “Should we re-introduce laws against blasphemy”, applied equally to all faiths of course, and perhaps extended to internet trolling, if a strong statistical correlation between blasphemy and public disorder can be established? A true libertarian would surely say “yes”, though the exact wording would be critical. The defining words ‘gratuitous’, ‘derogatory’ and ‘provocative’ spring to mind. However at present it would be difficult to show that there is sufficient frequency of blasphemy in the UK to establish the necessary strong statistical correlation here. Almost all the instances to date have been perpetrated on the continent, which perhaps only goes to show that our own responsibility-inducing free society so far is standing up well to the Napoleonic onslaught.\nFinally, what about Leveson? Applying my principle that the pursuit of truth takes precedence over freedom of speech, surely the obvious thing is to ‘do the experiment’. In other words enact his recommendations on a temporary basis by including a provision that the Act will automatically dissolve after say fifteen years. At that point we can then take a much better informed decision on whether to extend them.\nIf you are going for best contents like me, only pay a quick visit this web\npage everyday because it presents quality contents, thanks\nLikeLike\nHi there!

  "https_jepoynton_com_/https_jepoynton_com_2020_08_31_libertarian-or-democratic-libertarian/content_32.html": "One of the joys of our new Whats App sites is that you can have a jolly good debate over important issues and, as long as it doesn’t get personal, which all good debaters avoid, make substantial progress in developing them.\nInevitably in the aftermath of Brexit the debate has turned to the position of the party on the political spectrum. Before it really didn’t matter too much as we were all united behind the common objective of getting Britain out of the European Union. We have members from all walks of life and background, but once the tide goes out you can see what’s below!\nOur constitution, clause 2.5, says we are a democratic libertarian party. Small ‘d’ and small ‘l’. It does not say, as some have claimed, that we are a Libertarian party, with a capital ‘L’. I don’t know how much thought went into the original wording? Perhaps not very much and they were just looking for something vaguely neutral. However it says what it says, so what does it mean and do we want to change it? I discovered a general reluctance to change the constitution, but I don’t think many realise quite what a Mad Dictator’s Charter we have been lumbered with. However I am not going to go into that here as I have covered it in a previous post.\nMy immediate reaction is that the words ‘democratic’ and ‘libertarian’ qualify each other. Traditional libertarian theory pretty much means no taxes and no government, at least in its American incarnation, where all taxation is regarded as theft and only those paying into the pot should be entitled to a vote. This was the position espoused by John Stuart Mill writing in the 1860s and based on the theories of classical economics. Since then of course John Maynard Keynes has produced his General Theory in which he introduced the concept of involuntary unemployment and observed that economic equilibrium can occur at less than full employment. Keynes’ view is now mainstream. More recently we have become familiar with the notion of dysfunctional markets where the imbalance of supply and demand is so great that the price mechanism no longer works, such as in housing or steel, and government intervention is required.\nMills’ theories are not redundant however, particularly in the realm of social justice, and Keynes himself was careful to stress that the classical laws of economics remain valid in normal conditions. As with Einstein’s general theory in physics, the classical laws only break down in extreme circumstances such as for matter approaching the speed of light or the interaction between subatomic particles. In fact I think Keynes was being a tad pompous in comparing himself with Einstein because by the time he was writing he was analysing a different ‘nature’ whereas Einstein was explaining more deeply the original nature. That is because during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries the introduction of a full franchise and the advent of trades unions meant that a resistance to the downward movement of wages had developed which was not there before.\nThe principle tenet of JS Mill’s philosophy that I adhere to is that of the ‘Tyranny of the Majority’. If the majority decides everything then nothing is left to the discretion of the individual or to minority rights. Classic examples were Labour’s disbandment of catholic adoption agencies and their insistence on single-stream comprehensive schools and persecution of independent schools. In neither case is there any overriding national interest involved; no need for uniformity across the land. The Socialist view is totalitarian ideology in which Big Sister knows best.\nA free society might be defined as one in which the domain of morality is greater than the scope of the law. A bit like concentric circles it is the size of the gap in between them. A free society requires respect for the law, and that will only occur if everyone is equal under it. The law is there to protect us from harm or loss by third parties, and to enable us to deal with confidence with second parties. It is not there to protect us from ourselves nor to coerce us into patterns of behaviour which are simply of convenience to the state. A free society requires a strong sense of moral responsibility and history shows that it not only requires one, it also breeds one. By comparison in the EU, where most laws are based on Napoleonic law, you can only do what the law permits you to do. Here it is the other way around. That is now threatened by incoming alien cultures to replace the threat posed by the EU.\nAll libertarians reject the tyranny of socialism, but how far to the right do you have to go to escape it? This depends on whether the majority of voters are socialist or libertarian, and I am quite sure the majority in this country are libertarian. Indeed I maintain that the word ‘democratic’ in ‘democratic libertarian’ places us firmly at the centre of the political spectrum pretty much by definition. That is where the votes are, and there is no point in taking an extremist position where there aren’t any. Activists in all parties like the simple clarity of extremist positions, but activists are not typical of the general population.\nSo we need a simple yardstick to say what government should be about and what it should leave to the discretion of the individual. I suggest that yardstick should be the concept of ‘national interest’ as assessed objectively by its very nature. For example there is clearly a national, or common interest in defence and equality under the law. That means we must raise sufficient taxes to pay for these things as a common good. It also introduces the concept of a transfer of wealth from rich to poor as our tax systems are progressive. The money could not be raised otherwise.\nOther areas of policy are more debatable, but I argue that there is no national interest in allowing an unemployable underclass to develop. Not only do you have to be educated but you also have to be fit and healthy to pursue and hold down a job, and you have to be free of such structural unemployment factors such as the poverty trap and skill and regional imbalances. So education, health, welfare and regional policy also qualify, and so on. Those who argue that all taxes are theft should try earning a living on a desert island. They only reason they can do so is because they are part of a society that provides them with the economic opportunities and framework of law in which to do so, so some recompense is surely only just. I also pointed out that I do not myself now pay tax! Every year I use savings to make additional pension contributions so as to keep my taxable income to within the personal allowance. I would be pretty pissed off if I lost my right to vote as a result!\nAt the start of our discussions I tried to quantify such a centre position by saying we should limit central government expenditure to 35% of GDP. After all we have just been through a general election where Labour wanted to increase it to over 40% yet at the same time we are struggling to balance the books with a pre-Covid deficit of around £40bn, or 2% GDP, when the OECD says central government is currently spending 33.5% GDP and many public services are clearly struggling. This drew some sharp intakes of breath in certain quarters. OK the constitution in Clause 2.5 does go on to say that we will “seek to diminish the role of the State and lower the burden of taxation on individuals and businesses”. I can go along with that provided we remember that the majority of people in this country clearly want decent public services and a reliable welfare state.

He has no plan of where physically to put them! Rwanda could only take a few hundred and, while he recognises the need for other ‘safe places’ he cannot tell us where, how or when. He even thinks he can send them back to the EU, who are in fact absorbing even more than we are, by negotiating some sort of returns agreement. But why should they give us that? In return for what?\nI have repeatedly advocated purchasing a substantial tract of habitable land somewhere OUTSIDE Europe, perhaps Central Asia, to be run in perpetuity as British Sovereign Territory. Yes they would want a high price for this but it would be a gold mine of foreign currency for them as well as an effective local regional policy. As the old saying goes, you cannot win a war on a budget. In any event as the colony develops it own economy the burden on the British taxpayer would reduce. The colony would have open borders so that they can self-segregate between genuine asylum seekers, who would stay, and economic migrants who would leave.\nInterestingly I learnt over the weekend that recent polls in Sweden have shown that 79% who have been granted asylum do go home for holidays periodically. And in Germany it is 60%. Switzerland cancels their refugee status if they do.\nFinally let us never forget that a far greater problem is legal immigration. Around 70,000 a month compared to ‘just’ 5000 illegals. A tiny minority, probably around 1000 a month, have skills we cannot source in this country, but the remainder are just cheap labour who are taking out more than they are putting in. We must scrap the points-based system which allows Big Business to bring in as many as they want, and substitute an auctioned quota system where the quota is set a fewer than the number who emigrate each previous year. Only then can we start to reverse the immense damage open borders have caused this country in so many ways.\nThis includes our environment. I am looking forward to David Attenborough’s new series on the British Isles. We have a record rate of extinctions going on. I wonder if he will acknowledge that open borders are the cause?!\nWe also have record amounts of crap in our rivers from overflowing sewage works. Yes that’s right. CRAP. Don’t let them tell you it is agricultural runoff. That has been going on for decades. There is nothing new about that. The fact of the matter is that immigrants crap. OK, so do we, and my political opponents through both ends, but our sewage facilities were previously adequate for purpose. Now they are not. So who’s going to pay for all that new investment. We are!",
  "https_jepoynton_com_/https_jepoynton_com_2015_02_16_greece-the-eurozone-and-world-trade/content_43.html": "It would be easy and tempting for UKIP’ers to look smugly at the renewed chaos unfolding in Greece and say ‘I told you so’. Easy but unhelpful. Although small, Greece is still an export market for us, and if Greece crashes out of the Eurozone that would create massive contagion which would badly affect the whole of Europe including the UK. In any case I am sure we all wish the Greeks greater success for the future.\nSo what would we do in their situation? To answer that we must first remind ourselves of why all the Mediterranean Eurozone countries are so determined to keep using the euro. It’s not just the War and history of invasion, it is also that all of these countries are incorrigibly corrupt. Their citizens no longer trust their own politicians and so turn to the European Union as a mechanism to counter this. So it’s no use telling them to ditch the euro. They might still do that, but only out of sheer desperation.\nThere are two quite separate parts to the Greek, and other Mediterranean country, economic crises: they have a fiscal deficit on government taxes and expenditure, and they have a balance of payments deficit on external trade . The former causes the more immediate challenge, and hence gets the attention of the EU, ECB and IMF ‘troika’, but the external trade deficit is just as, if not more, debilitating in the long run. It is the external deficit I want to examine in this article, as we have a very similar problem.\nThe UK’s balance of external payments is now running at a deficit of over 5% GDP and getting worse. And that during a recession! You would normally expect your external payments to move into surplus during a recession as imports fall. In theory if you have a deficit the need to fund that deficit creates a need to purchase foreign currency, which in turn devalues sterling. That in turn makes our currency more competitive and so help to boost exports and reduce imports, thereby re-balancing our external trade automatically. In theory. In practice capital flows have grown and overwhelmed trading flows, and as the French economist, Thomas Piketty, pointed out recently, capital to GDP ratios continue to increase across the world.\nGreece of course can’t do this anyway as they have in effect a fixed exchange rate by using the euro. Part of the idea behind austerity was that costs would fall thereby achieving an ‘internal devaluation’, but whilst costs in Greece have fallen substantially over the past five years it has not led to any regeneration in the economy. In fact perversely it has simply led to Greece’s debts becoming a higher proportion of GDP as GDP has fallen, whilst unemployment has continued to rise.\nIt was Adam Smith who originally observed that the wealth of a nation is the product of its labour. So if you want your country to get richer (and generate higher tax revenues) you must get unemployment down as low as possible without triggering inflation. Yanis Varoufakis, the new Greek finance minister seems to have remembered this whereas the troika have not, and is now coming up against the sort of block-headed intransigence from the European Union we in the UK know so well. Even under the most primitive of jurisdictions, if new evidence comes to light you reopen the case. The failure of austerity clearly constitutes new evidence, yet Wolfgang Schrauble, Germany’s finance minister has simply said that the new Syriza government is bound by the contractual terms of Greece’s E245bn bail-in, and that “Elections change nothing. There are rules”. We can only wish Mr. Varoufakis the best of luck with that one.\nBut even suppose Greece does manage to secure terms for a debt restructuring and recovery, that is not going to change their external imbalance. Indeed it will make it worse as more imports are sucked in. So we need to look for a new solution to the problem of trade imbalances both for within the Eurozone and across the rest of the world as well. There are now massive trade imbalances around the whole world, not least between China and the United States. Further the old GATT/WTO rounds of trade talks aimed at reducing trading tariffs so as to promote world trade generally have ground to a halt for some time now, since such talks have little chance of success if they start from a position of imbalance.\nThe Bretton Woods conference, master-minded by John Maynard Keynes after the second world war, aimed at creating stability in world trade through a system of fixed exchange rates. It held for a couple of decades before collapsing because different countries experienced different rates of inflation. Britain in particular, due to a succession of weak Labour governments and the Heath government pursuing inflationary policies for political reasons, experienced a whole series of ‘runs on the pound’, and made the collapse of manufacturing in this country inevitable. Eventually we floated the pound in 1971 and a new international regime of floating exchange rates followed, with mixed success. However it can undoubtedly be said that Britain’s exit from the ERM in 1992, coinciding as it did with a time of high unemployment, which meant that the inflationary effects of devaluation were absorbed, laid the foundation for ten years of solid economic growth. So strong in fact that it took Gordon Brown quite a while to ruin it!\nThomas Piketty’s research is very relevant here, and while in my opinion he rather loses the plot when drawing conclusions from it, the value of his book, Capital in the 21st Century, lies in that research. The continued increase in capital to GDP ratios means that we cannot allow things to continue unchanged. The imbalances will only get worse as international capital flows increase. The irony is that the solution lies in precisely the very thing that successive rounds of GATT/WTO talks have been trying to reduce; import tariffs.\nIt has always been recognised that the danger of import tariffs lies in the fact that they can become competitive and create trade wars. However if you set up a successor Bretton Woods regime under which only deficit countries were allowed to set import tariffs, and the IMF were to set limits for each country according to the size of their deficit, then that would not happen. It could be applied separately to Greece as the new regime would be currency-independent. That would create a partial devaluation for Greece in that it would promote import substitution, though of course it would do nothing for exports. But it would also provide an additional fiscal revenue stream which can be used to stimulate the economy and reduce unemployment.\nIn a world where the environment is under threat, the continued expansion of world trade in itself must be questioned. I would venture that it is the balance of trade that matters far more than the volume of it. Of course world trade gives consumers much greater choice, and it allows small countries with limited resources of their own to join in. But ultimately Adam Smith was right. It is the product of your labour that makes you rich, what today we call ‘adding value’, and a country that only exports natural resources will return to poverty when those resources run out.\nIn Britain however there is a further way we can improve our competitiveness. By setting up a Sovereign Wealth Fund to hedge the National Debt. As you may have seen in my election address, I have castigated the Coalition for overlooking this. But what I did not say there is that funds nowadays are invested globally. It follows that a substantial proportion of the wealth fund would be invested overseas, which would involve the selling of sterling, which in turn would make it more competitive. The Chinese have always had a high propensity to save, and it was by investing in US Treasury bonds that their export boom and consequent high rate of economic growth was created. We can do the same.\nHello blogger, do you monetize your website ? There\nis easy way to earn extra money every day, just\nsearch on youtube – How to earn with wordai 4\nLikeLike",
  "https_jepoynton_com_/https_jepoynton_com_2019_03_11_export-subsidies-vs-refunds-of-foreign-import-tariffs/content_23.html": "This article is a follow up to my previous post entitled ‘Nissan, Felixstowe, Lettuces and Whisky’ in which I proposed a system of refunding foreign importers of British exports for the import tariffs they will pay to their own governments after Brexit, thereby allowing our exports to continue unaffected. If nothing is done about this our exports will suffer. Even though the economy overall will get a net boost from a No Deal Brexit, because the effect of import substitution will be so much greater than that of export substitution simply on account of the massive trade deficit we have with the other EU countries, and the Treasury will benefit from another £25 billion in revenues from the import tariffs, it is still a fly in the ointment and better to remove if we can.\nThe impact on our exports is the only logical element of Project Fear left that has any substance, given that all the remaining issues are being quietly dealt with through side agreements with those concerned. If we can deal with the export issue as well, that leaves the anti-No Deal brigade completely naked.\nSo I thought it prudent to check my interpretation of the WTO Rules with a leading QC. His reply was instant, unequivocal and offered no discussion of the rules themselves. He said my scheme is clearly prohibited! When I pressed him in reply I have not received any response. The good news was that he confirmed by default there is no other aspect of the Rules, other than than the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures to which I referred in my previous post, that affect the decision, so I have not missed anything. The nature of his response left me suspicious that these lawyers will just play safe and protect their own backsides, especially if they are not being paid! So is he right?\nYou will find the critical articles at https://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/24-scm.pdf. Let’s look more closely at them:\nArticle 1 defines a subsidy in various ways none of which include payments to foreign importers. Indeed it specifically refers to payments or discounts within the territory of the Member government. It goes on to say that such subsidies will only be prohibited if they are ‘specific’ in accordance with Article 2.\nArticle 2 defines specificity as payments (etc. as above) to ‘an enterprise or industry or group of enterprises or industries within the jurisdiction of the granting authority’. My scheme is therefore clear on both counts, namely that it is general to all exports and countries, and that the recipients are not within the jurisdiction of the granting authority (UK government).\nArticle 3 deals with prohibition directly which it defines in three ways, namely (1)subsidies contingent on export performance, (2) subsidies contingent on the use of domestic over imported goods, as well as (3) the provisions of Articles 1 and 2 above. Quite clearly my scheme clears all of these hurdles.\nArticle 4 is even more fascinating. It deals with remedies for complaining members. It sets out procedures for complaint, arbitration and appeal, all of which are dealt with within the WTO itself. So suppose, despite all the above, a decision went against us; what is the worst that can happen? There are no provisions for fines or exclusion, only that the offended member can take its own countervailing measures against us, and then only if the WTO thinks they are appropriate.\nSo what countervailing measures could the EU take against us? The most obvious one is that they could do the same and start paying our importers for tariffs paid to us. But hang on a sec, isn’t that just a reversion to free trade anyway? Exactly what the numpties in Parliament want in the first place! We would still be faced with taking our own countervailing measures against all the barriers the EU has mounted against us over the past twenty years (the WTO may even support our own complaint against them!), but at least our exports would be protected and our consumers would be delirious.\nAlternatively the EU could do something like double its own tariffs. In which case we do exactly the same to them. It would be a trade war (partly sanctioned by the WTO – we would then be contravening the most-favoured nation principle, but so what if the EU is allowed to do so), but one we would win easily on account the massive trade deficit we have with them.\nSo whichever way it goes there is nothing to fear. It’s win-win. So let’s just get on with it – leave the EU unilaterally and protect our exporters in this way at the same time. Publish and be damned!\nFinally two further thoughts: 1). If I can be given wrong advice by a lawyer, what have government minsters and business leaders been getting?, and (2) the SCM Agreement is actually very cleverly written to give remedy to deficit countries but not to surplus ones, thereby creating an automatic stability mechanism. Unfortunately it is routinely misunderstood. The WTO should clarify and promote it to address the massive international trade imbalances that currently threaten the global economy.",
  "https_jepoynton_com_/https_jepoynton_com_2018_02_01_an-epistle-to-the-germans/content_30.html": "One of the papers I get a regular email summary from is Handelsblatt Global. Last Friday, 26th January 2018, they did a piece on Germans’ attitude to money. I reproduce it at the bottom. I decided to reply to the editor, Andreas Kluth, as follows.\nDear Sir,\nThank you for this opportunity to provide some feedback. I had not noticed it before. I am a Kipper (member of UKIP) and retired Chartered Accountant, and was fascinated by your article about Germans’ attitude to money. I had some experience of doing business in Germany in the early 90’s (your tax system is far more logical than ours, and I enjoyed the opportunity to write off goodwill against tax!) but recall the difficulties of paying bills by credit card. Now I know why!\nI am concerned that there is so little understanding of Brexit on the continent. UKIP (and the AfD) are routinely and lazily dismissed as racist and right-wing, whereas in fact we are nothing of the sort. I was fascinated recently by a television documentary here from Freital. When people feel insecure, threatened, ignored and shat upon from on high they get angry, and when they get angry they get confrontational and even violent and abusive. It’s regrettable but it’s the only way they can get attention, and it’s perfectly normal human behaviour. No amount of sanctimonious lecturing is going to change that. The only solution is to address the underlying problems, and that means listening to the message rather than shooting the messenger. I am assuming of course that democracy prevails. You can suppress the few, but you cannot suppress the many. Even Machiavelli understood that.\nPeople look to their own kind for support (hence all the flag waving and putting their country first – all of which I don’t personally chime with) and I see exactly the same thing in my prospective constituency of Southall in West London where there is a majority black and Asian community. We have the largest Sikh community outside India, yet we also have many other ethnic groups as well. The interesting thing is that they all self-segregate into their own streets and around their own places of worship. They feel safer that way and I don’t blame them or have a problem with it, yet when the indigenous community does exactly the same thing they are called racist! There is surely a difference between diversity (good) and cultural displacement (bad)? Many immigrants are in fact white. The immigration debate is about numbers, not race.\nI can tell you that my Asian constituents understand Brexit perfectly. It’s the white metropolitan lefties who are the problem. We had a 40% vote in favour of Leave in the referendum (London generally voted to remain). The housing crisis, deteriorating public services and environmental pollution are all major concerns. On average Britons today are 25% worse off than they were 30 years ago (download the numbers for GDP, population and prices and you can see for yourself), and the effect is magnified by widening pay and regional employment gaps partly caused by wage compression from immigration. The metropolitan elite have managed to insulate themselves financially in this way, which probably explains their arrogance and their ignorance.\nAs I am sure you know, historically the term right-wing derives from the National Assembly in France during the French Revolution when the bourgeoisie, who were better off and better educated, sat to the right of the speaker. Not only were they richer but they also believed in a restricted franchise. Fascism also has its roots in belief in rule by the elite. If anything therefore it is Remainers who are right-wing in Britain, not Brexiteers.\nI don’t know how hot you are on English history, but I see this political divide today as similar to that between Catholics and Protestants in the 16th and 17th centuries. Nigel Farage is Martin Luther (ok, he was German!) with his protestations against the indulgences of the Catholic Church (the EU). David Cameron was Mary, Queen of Scots, whose fateful letter to Anthony Babington (Nick Clegg) led to her execution (the referendum result). The Spanish Armada (Article 50) continues to advance. Let’s hope David Davis (Sir Francis Drake) has enough balls (non-canon variety) to win the Battle of Gravelines, though the weather (Theresa May) is decidedly changeable! In fact it took another hundred years until the accession of William of Orange and the Glorious Revolution of 1689 for the matter finally to be settled. Since then of course we have enjoyed great success with our German monarchy (many thanks – a big improvement on the Normans). UKIP may be suffering an attack of hiccups at the moment, but if Theresa May screws up Brexit, which is now looking very likely, I can but quote Arnold Schwarzenegger in The Terminator – “We’ll be back”!\nUKIP is still seen as a single issue party, despite two very comprehensive manifestos for the last two general elections in 2015 and 2017. We stand as a centre radical libertarian alternative to the failed ideologies of socialism and conservatism (big brothers and dead sheep) who are only interested in keeping each other out. Our national political and economic situation reminds me of that of the victim in Edgar Allan Poe’s novel The Pendulum. In it the victim is strapped onto a table and cannot move. Just above him a huge pendulum is swinging from side to side with a huge knife on its underside. Tick, tock, Left, Right it goes on and, with every tick and every tock it descends another notch. Our fate is predictable if we cannot escape our bonds (the EU) and smash the pendulum (proportional representation). Why, for example, do we have to take our essential services from hopelessly inefficient public sector monopolies? Why should we not have the option to purchase them from the private sector on a means-tested basis, perhaps by using a national credit card managed through the tax system? Why do we have to send our children to single-stream comprehensive schools when it is perfectly obvious that many children, particularly those from poorer groups, are struggling to keep up and it is clear they need preferential support and perhaps a more focused curriculum? And why cannot we have a cash alternative to housing benefit when the public sector cannot supply sufficient social housing? It’s all about freedom of choice. I could go on.\nHowever it is trade and the economy that worry me most. Over the past 30 years, since the onset of globalisation and the transfer of responsibility for our trading affairs to the EU, we have built up a massive trade deficit amounting to around 5% of GDP. The EU deserves the sack for that alone! A trade deficit is like having a hole in the bottom of our economy, and is the single most obvious reason for the decline in our standard of living. Jobs, wealth and consumer demand are pouring out of it all the time, and if nothing were done about it unemployment would go through the roof.\nFortunately the Bank of England came up with a cunning wheeze called Quantitative Easing. This works by reducing interest rates thereby persuading people to borrow their future income to spend today. Unfortunately it also has the effect both of building up a personal debt mountain (all bubbles burst eventually) and of reducing savings, thereby starving the banks of money to lend to business for investment and productivity growth. And the media wonder why we have a productivity gap?!\nAs Mervyn King (Governor of the Bank of England between 2003 and 2013) points out in his recent book, QE can only be a temporary fix. Sooner or later tomorrow becomes today and everyone has already spent all their income and cannot borrow any more. Thus the only permanent solution is to eliminate our trade deficit. If we fail to do that interest rates will remain on the floor and not only will our standard of living continue to decline but people will remain unable to save for their retirement and we will have an even greater financial crisis when the debt bubble bursts.\nAny attempt to do a trade deal with the EU as part of the Article 50 negotiations will have the effect of locking us into our £70bn trade deficit, as well as denying us some £25bn or so of import tariff revenues. There are only two ways a country to manage its trade balance – devaluation and import tariffs – both of which are only available through Brexit. It is surely imperative for us to maintain sufficient flexibility to increase our import tariffs to a level that will balance our trade, but nobody seems to have spotted this. Theresa May is clearly out of her depth and doesn’t understand the economics of it, and gets poor advice from a civil service that is no longer fit for purpose, possibly due to having been subject to years of subservience to Brussels and decades of politically-correct social engineering as well as being institutionally biased in favour of Remain. A future UKIP government would have no hesitation in tearing up anything she has signed.\nThere was never any need to enter into the Article 50 negotiations at all. I am not surprised that M. Barnier cannot decipher what we want from them. The real answer is nothing! Non-tariff barriers can be overcome by the use of online predeclarations and ANPR cameras, and trackers fitted to lorries would remove the need for inspections at borders; a simple bilateral treaty with Ireland to run joint external border controls would remove the need for a hard internal border; and a two-tier immigration system (balanced migration for citizenship on a first-come first served basis following fifteen years of self-sufficient residency under a points system set to keep the citizenship queue to a reasonable length) would surely preclude the need for special arrangements for EU citizens, which we see as discriminatory anyway. Even the City is now relaxed about banking passports. What is there to negotiate? If you do not throw stones at us we will not throw them at you. Never cast the first stone. Isn’t that all we need to agree?\nI shall never understand the continental fixation with free movement of people; presumably some sort of hangover from the war? My view is that removing borders between countries is a bit like removing the bulkheads from within an ocean-going oil tanker. It just creates instability. Balanced trade and balanced migration must surely be a precondition for peace and prosperity. Just as the human body is composed of cells, the family composed of individuals and the nation state is composed of families, so the global community is composed of nation states. If the cell structure breaks down the result is cancer and death. If democracy is extinguished in one part of the world it can continue to shine like a beacon elsewhere. That is why I am a strong nationalist, as well as a strong believer in the benefits of competition both economically and culturally (ok, we might let you win a football match sometime!)\nAlso I shall never forgive our Treasury mandarins for failing to advise George Osborne to start a Sovereign Wealth Fund when interest rates first hit the floor nearly ten years ago (I accept he would never have thought of it for himself). We now have a national debt approaching £2trn plus another £4trn or so of unfunded pension liabilities which will hit us later this century. If taxpayers can’t even fund our fiscal deficit now they will have no chance of producing surpluses of this order later. Yet the solution is staring us in the face. Any decent fund manager will get returns of between 7 and 10% on average long term from global equities, yet government 30 year money costs less than 3% simple interest at present. Even just a 5% return compounded would quadruple our money over 30 years – enough to repay the loans and all the interest on them and leave a substantial unencumbered fund thereafter. They can’t even be proper Anglo-Saxons when we want them to be! Where are the non-conformists? Where are the original thinkers? Where are the problem-solvers? Our establishment today represents the lowest common denominator from our paranoid quest for equality. UKIP stands fore-square against all forms of discrimination, including positive discrimination, but with the single exception of ability-ism. I don’t mind where they come from, and it is great to see so many women and people of colour becoming prominent and successful, but we must always chose the best.\nI think Germans are very fortunate to have a distaste for debt. It has kept your trade in surplus and your economy stable. Even so your psychology is not in fact that different to ours. You may suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) on account of your recent history, but our barmy establishment suffers one from our imperialistic past too, which is hardly taught in schools any more. I enjoy reminding them that the British Empire was the first Single Market! You cannot judge the past by today’s values. The glorious irony is that history programmes on the telly have never been more popular, even those going back to Roman and Norman times.\nDon’t be put off by our programmes on WW2, which I see your retiring Ambassador to London is so exercised about. It’s nothing personal. We are saddened by your apparent desire to lose your national identity in Europe, which we think distorts your assessment of the EU. As a nation you have much to be proud of. Let us all remember the teaching of the Bible which exhorts us to “visit not on the sons the sins of the fathers” (to which I always like to add “and neither credit to the sons the claims of the fathers”!). I am quite sure few Brits today blame Germans today for WW2, and as generational renewal, which has always been the ultimate cure for accumulated traumas, proceeds those with direct family memories will die out. Life goes on. It’s just history, from which we learn about human psychology generally.\nWell, I hope you liked my little bit of feedback,\nWith very best wishes,\nJohn Poynton\n******************\n|",
  "https_jepoynton_com_/https_jepoynton_com_tag_economy/content_12.html": "Mr. Speaker, it is an honour and a privilege for me to have this opportunity to present to the House the government’s budget for the coming year.\nAs the House will already know, our economy and government finances are in a desperate and sorry state. Over the past nearly 25 years we have suffered a series of setbacks that have enveloped us in a perfect storm, starting with our membership of the European Union Single Market which has seen our trade balance with those countries plummet from having been broadly in balance to a deficit at the time of the Brexit Referendum of £109 billion; that’s 6% of GDP at that time. This has presented British business with a contracting market. Generally speaking business will not invest into a contracting market, with the result that productivity growth has suffered.\nThen we had the banking crisis, triggered by an oil price spike in 2007 which led to the default of many sub-prime mortgages in the USA and which our banks had invested into. But there were also collapses on this side of the pond such as Northern Rock and HBOS which were simply due to over-trading, and that can only be due to a failure of regulation here. One bright spot then arises as the banks were quickly recapitalised through the use of quantitative easing, which did not on that occasion produce inflation as it was merely replacing credit which had been destroyed in the crisis. Unfortunately later on the QE was restarted with inevitable inflationary consequences.\nOn top of all that we had austerity and the failure to start a Sovereign Wealth Fund when interest rates hit the floor. Mr. Speaker, I am sure that most members are aware that 5% compounded will quadruple your money within 30 years, and 7% double it within ten. Over the past thirty years returns on many foreign shares have been far greater than the cost of government borrowing here. That is because the rate of growth in many other countries has been far faster than it has been here and is likely to continue that way for some time to come. It must make sense for us to benefit from their success in this way. A golden opportunity completely missed.\nThen we come to Brexit which some today are blaming for all our financial woes. Mr. Speaker, I do not accept that analysis but instead that the Trade and Co-operation Agreement has locked us into the catastrophic trade deficit we inherited from the Single Market. It is not enough to secure no tariffs in either direction when there are a host of other regulations creating the imbalance, and we need the use of tariffs to counter that effect. That will almost certainly mean scrapping the TCA, and whilst trade volumes may fall, the much greater effect of import substitution will present British business at home with the expanding market they crave to invest and create productivity growth and jobs.\nFollowing that we had Covid and the energy crisis caused by the war in Ukraine, thankfully temporarily as Russia has found other outlets into the international oil markets, and all of the panic over climate change. And if that weren’t enough mass immigration, quite apart from increasing cultural conflict within the country, has condemned wages to minimum levels, undermined working conditions and caused record levels of unemployment and homelessness. And to cap it all, we have an ageing population pushing the cost of pensions and health care through the roof. Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear!\nNow, Mr. Speaker, it is not my intention to spend time trying to apportion blame for this situation. Many of these circumstances were beyond our control, and for others it is easy to be wise after the event. My purpose is to identify the causes so we can take appropriate action to remedy them and to quantify the task itself. Our National Debt is now close to 100% of GDP after having been nearly paid off a quarter of a century ago, and the cost of interest on that debt is now over £100 billion a year, nearly 4% GDP in itself, and rising. The total fiscal deficit is around £170 billion and that is adding to the Debt all the time. It is imperative, Mr. Speaker, that we get our nose ahead of the game so that we can reverse the whole process.\nMy strategy is based on three key objectives necessary to provide a tripod of stability for our recovery. First I aim to achieve a fiscal surplus of 1% GDP within five years. Second I want a trade surplus of 1% GDP by that time, and third we must achieve net zero immigration as well. Add to that some essential tax cuts to motivate growth and expenditure increases to avoid imminent collapse of some public services and we are looking at an annual fiscal turnaround of £300 billion by the end of our first five years.\nOn average I must save £60 billion in each of the next five years, but that is only on average. There are couple of policies which can raise substantial funds in excess of this amount up front, while others such as revived economic growth will be weighted towards the end. The good news is that over the following five years those trends should lead to a much greater turnaround of around £450 billion or more, with much greater scope for both tax cuts and expenditure increases, which I shall aim broadly to keep equal. I shall also aim to cut the total level of taxation down to 30% GDP, whereas currently it is around 37%, all the while maintaining fiscal and trade surpluses of 1% GDP. History shows that all the economies with the highest rates of economic growth have run Balance of Payments surpluses and I am determined the UK should be in that group.\nSo, Mr. Speaker, let me make a start.\nMy first port of call is multinational corporations, which have long had a habit of shifting their profits into tax havens, or semi tax havens such as the Republic of Ireland, to avoid corporation tax in this country. Now I accept that at 25% our rate of corporation tax is too high, and I shall return to that later, but for now may I completely reject the argument that this country must somehow engage in a race to bottom just to remain competitive. There are other ways we can regulate our trade balance, and in any case if were able to collect what is morally due to us, profits made out purchases by the good citizens of this country, that would provide the funds to reduce it.\nOver ten years ago now, the G8 at its summit in Enniskillen tasked the OECD with ending this practice. They have completely failed to do so and show no signs of any significant progress as they just kick the can further on down the road. Clearly the multinationals have got to them! We cannot afford to wait any longer.\nThe good news is that this is very easy to rectify. Henceforth multinationals, which we shall define as any company that has more than 10% of its turnover in more than one country, shall be taxed on the basis of their global profits, as declared to their shareholders and in the public domain, and apportioned to this country by turnover, including non-domestic intercompany sales. They may be able to shift their head offices and their intellectual property rights, but they cannot shift their customers! It is difficult to forecast accurately without an established database exactly how much additional revenue this will raise, but our best estimates suggest it could be within the range of £40 to 50 billion if not more.\nSecond, Mr. Speaker, I am abolishing Inheritance Tax. It is a very inefficient tax, raising only about a third of 1% GDP; is double taxation in the hands of the deceased; uses up a disproportionate amount of tax legislation and consequently distracts the attention of thousands of lawyers and accountants who should be more constructively engaged.\nHowever I recognise that a society in which around 2% of the population own 80% of its assets is not a healthy one. I want to reduce this wealth gap but not eliminate it. It remains important that those with energy, ability and enterprise can profit from them for the benefit of us all. In practice however much of this accumulated wealth is passive asset appreciation.\nI therefore aim to raise about 2% GDP by charging legacies to capital gains tax in the hands of beneficiaries. This would require a 50% withholding tax to counter avoidance, but which would be repaid, with interest, when the gains are presented for assessment. I do not propose to introduce a wealth tax, which would also be double taxation in the hands of the taxpayer as well as very difficult to collect as much of it would disappear into overseas trusts and corporate structures.\nCapital gains will be assessed to income tax at the taxpayer’s marginal rate with no additional allowances. However I am allowing it to be spread over ten years so that poorer beneficiaries can use up more of their allowances and lower rate bands. This reflects the rule-of-thumb PE ratio of 10 often used to value small companies.\nExisting roll-over reliefs from inheritance tax such as for farms and businesses will be maintained and I am adding relief for the repayment of any student loans, not necessarily those of the taxpayer. Tax on occupied primary residences, again not necessarily by the taxpayer or his family, such as a sitting tenant, may be deferred until that occupant leaves.\nI am also abolishing Non-Dom status, but replacing it with a flat cap on income tax, including capital gains, of £250,000 in any one year.\nThese two changes alone should raise around £80 billion a year. I am not seeking to raise any other taxes. I am however reintroducing marginal relief from corporation tax for small businesses with a zero rate allowance of one million and a lower rate band of two million. The lower rate will be half the full rate which remains at 25%. In the longer term I aim to reduce taxation to 30% GDP and increase the personal tax allowance to match the typical minimum wage at £20,000, and reduce the top rate to 40%. I may also introduce an intermediate rate at 30%.\nMr. Speaker I now come to a series of changes focused on reducing the burden on the taxpayer without endangering essential public services by focusing on efficiency and alternative sources of finance.\nBetter late than never I am introducing a Sovereign Wealth Fund which will be funded by borrowing at an interest rate not greater than 5% and at an amount, if available in the gilts markets, of 1% GDP a year. The asset will offset the liability and therefore have no effect on net debt. This will be farmed out to multiple professional fund managers with after time the more successful attracting greater contributions.\nIn addition I am starting the funding of a new state pension. This necessarily must be a gradual and prolonged process which will not have any significant effect on the public finances for many years. It will be available only to those under the age of 25 on 6th April next year and will be optional. Modelling suggests it will primarily benefit those on above average salaries, thereby halving in due course the number in the existing state pension. This in turn may allow us to improve the existing state pension significantly. For those who opt in, the existing employee national insurance contribution of 8% becomes a national pension contribution and is placed in an account in their name to which a guaranteed 4% interest as added annually. Of the three parameters of contribution rate, retirement age and pension amount, they will have the flexibility to fix any two and get a quote for the third. They may opt in or change these parameters at a later date, subject to not reducing the pension to an annuity equivalent below the level that would trigger entitlement to pension credits, and their remaining entitlement to the existing state pension will be determined by the number of years’ contributions in the existing way. This will create a fully flexible and transferable pension scheme which is currently unavailable to many, including those who switch employment between the public and private sectors. The money will physically go into the Sovereign Wealth Fund, which should get a better return for carrying risk, and will be part of its 1% GDP per annum funding target.\nMr. Speaker I am also introducing a National Credit Card. The purpose of the card is to give all citizens access to the private sector for essential services such as health and education on a means-tested basis. Just taking the health and schools budgets alone costs the taxpayer around £250 billion a year. If 50% used the private sector instead, and the average means-tested support for fees was also 50%, then the saving to the taxpayer would be over £60 billion a year.\nWe shall have to introduce this gradually to enable the supply side to meet increasing demand and it will be optional. Users pay for services in the normal way but do not have to settle the card at the end of the month. Instead after the end of the year when the taxman assesses your tax he will also review how much you have spent on your card, put the two together and recharge your share of the cost to your tax bill for the following year. Working capital will come from the Sovereign Wealth Fund at 5% which will be added to your costs from the date of purchase, but users will be able to pay on account to avoid it. The means test rate will be a simple percentage set at the beginning of each fiscal year for each user set in due course to encourage 50% usage. Much of these savings will then be available to improve the state services, and the fact that the private sector is accessible to all will remove any stain of privilege that some attribute to it at present.\nMr. Speaker, with the help of my RH colleagues I am taking a number of measures to improve efficiency within our public services. First we shall be splitting the civil service clean in two so that the advisory side, which advises ministers on current problems and future legislation, becomes completely separate and independent from the executive side, which delivers services mandated by Parliament. Two completely separate functions requiring separate organisational structures. This way the advisory side can assist ministers in holding the executive side to account.\nSecond we shall be appointing a national chief executive with the power to hire and fire local chief executives for every national public service. It is an extraordinary fact that currently few if any of our public services actually have any top management at all. No wonder they are all running around like headless chickens being hopelessly inefficient.\nThese chief executives will be mandated to ensure that sufficient trained British staff are recruited into each service, that they are paid the rate for the job so that staff turnover rates are minimised, and that agency and support staff are reduced to less than 25% of payroll each. I am also allowing staff bonuses to be paid out of 10% of any local budget savings or collected charges.\nThird, I am abolishing national wage bargaining in the tax funded public sector. Henceforth all such staff will be paid a full inflationary increase on 1st April each year. I reject the argument that this will create an inflationary wage spiral on the grounds both that there are no prices in this sector and that inflation increases the tax base anyway. But it is also important for staffing stability that all staff are paid the rate for the job, which will vary by skill and location across the country with additional increases awarded locally and which therefore cannot be addressed on a national basis.\nThese measures taken together could save another £30 billion a year as well as ensure they are no longer dependent on immigration for staff.\nSpeaking of immigration, my RH friend the Home Secretary will be scrapping the current points-based system and replacing it with an auctioned reducing quota system so that total immigration is reduced to below emigration rates within five years. It is therefore vital that we are able to reduce unemployment at the same or faster rate. Indeed we currently have over 3% job vacancies across our economy which is roughly double historical norms and only serves to suck in yet more immigrants. I shall therefore be instructing the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee henceforth to use a composite 4% target when setting interest rates; that is 2% inflation plus 2% job vacancies. I anticipate this will mean interest rates will remain at around the 5% mark for the foreseeable future, which is necessary anyway to encourage savings and fund investment, and will also probably be needed to contain the inflationary impact of wage rises in a tighter labour market. I shall be addressing the housing market separately in a few moments.\nIn addition I have a new regional policy designed to reduce the regional pay and unemployment gaps. It must make sense to focus stimulation to where unemployment is highest post code by post code across the country leading eventually to an even level of percentage employment across the land. This will increase income tax revenues and reduce welfare claims so it is likely to be fiscally neutral in the longer term.\nTo do so I shall cease funding new free tax and enterprise zones, which have a very chequered and uneven history, and instead introduce discounts for income tax, business rates and employers national insurance where the discount is proportionate to the local level of unemployment. For the coming year this discount will be 5% for every 1% that unemployment, measured on the claimant basis, is above 5%. We will review this algorithm annually to ensure a steady reduction in the regional gap.\nI also have a number of measures to free up the labour market to reduce structural unemployment. First I am repealing all IR35 legislation, which was designed to prevent employers avoiding the cost of national insurance contributions on permanent staff, by the simple measure of charging the invoices of self-employed and agency staff to NICs also. Professional fees will be exempt. The increased revenues will be used to reduce employers NICs for all so that the measure is fiscally neutral.\nIn any case I am immediately reducing employers NICs to 12% and increasing the minimum wage and universal credits in line with the triple lock on the state pension. I am also introducing marginal relief for employers NI with a zero alowance of £1000 per week of payroll, and a lower band of £2000 at a rate of half the full rate.\nSecond my RH friend the Work and Pensions Secretary will be undertaking a full post-implementation review of the introduction of Universal Credits with a view to making it simpler and more streamlined and efficient. In particular he will ensure that the thresholds for and rates of clawback are also universal, and that once vetted claimants do not have to reapply every time they get a gap between jobs. This is particularly important for self-employed people who currently often decline short term or low paid assignments because of the hassle and delays in reapplying.\nWithin this context I am increasing the threshold, or earnings disregard, for clawback of universal credits to £50 per week. This will create a much greater incentive for unemployed people to make that first leap back into employment, and will also allow low paid workers in the taper to keep more of what they themselves have earned. This will both reduce the poverty trap and the pressure on food banks many of which are struggling to obtain sufficient supplies.\nMr. Speaker, I now turn to support for farmers and care homes. At first sight they do not have much in common but they are both essential to our wellbeing, are competitive within the private sector and yet need financial support if they are to produce both food and care at affordable levels and remain profitable. Furthermore farmers are in competition with foreign imports which are heavily subsidised.\nFor both industries I am introducing a public subsidy at 10% on turnover. This will be subject to a profit cap at 5% before tax to prevent profiteering by larger businesses at the expense of both taxpayer and customer. The subsidy is designed to promote sales, and the profit cap will encourage competitive pricing and support greater expenditure. Qualifying directors remuneration will be restricted. In future years the rate of subsidy will be adjusted so that no more than 5% of businesses liquidate each year.\nMany businesses in a variety of industries receive public subsidies and there has been much concern at their profits. I am therefore extending the profit cap to all entities in receipt of public subsidy, though the cap may vary according to their capital investment requirements. I am also extending it proportionately to all companies with contracts with the public sector worth annually over 10% of their turnover.\nFinally Mr. Speaker I come to the housing market. I shall be reducing house prices from now on by between 1 and 2% a year on average. This is easily done by giving the Bank of England that target and by tightening criteria such as mortgage to value and income to mortgage used by commercial lenders.\nNow you may at first sight think that would make it more difficult for prospective purchasers to find and buy a new house, but in fact that is not so. For one thing the number of available houses out there does not change, and for another the supply is likely to increase because sellers will hurry to sell before prices reduce further. More importantly developers will no longer be able to make capital gains on their land banks and so can only build houses on them and sell them. In monetary terms the reduction in demand will be matched by a reduction is prices until all available houses are sold.\nThe misconstrued Help to Buy policy has just made matters worse, so I am in effect reversing it. Last year fewer new houses were built than before the policy was introduced over ten years ago and it has just pushed house prices even higher. Irrespective of whether we can balance supply and demand, the amount of credit tied up in the housing market means that house prices are likely to remain high. Yet house prices must come down if younger people are to buy when they get married and start a family and others to escape the parental nest and develop as independent adults.\nCurrently it takes on average over five years to build out a granted planning consent whereas no so long ago it was only two. It has been reported that there are hundreds of thousands of such consents gathering dust in the pending trays of property developers because they can make more money from capital gains. But it is important to understand also that they have themselves been squeezed by increasing land prices. As a result they have endeavoured to recoup their margins by resorting to dodgy practices such as denying buyers adequate snagging periods and tying them up into leaseholds with uncontrollable ground rent increases, and generally cutting costs and building to very low standards. Many such properties are now unsaleable. Mr. Speaker I am giving Help to Buy purchasers a new six month snagging period, with a survey at taxpayer’s expense to ensure objectivity, and with all restitution costs at the sellers expense.\nMy RH friend the Secretary of State for Housing, will be carrying out a full review of planning and related procedures including the possible repeal of the 1961 Land Compensation Act which gives 100% of all planning gain to landowners. We believe it may be more appropriate to divide planning gain equally between landowners, a national development corporation with powers of compulsory purchase to focus new development in the North where there are plentiful brownfield sites available, supported by regional policy which will encourage both people and jobs to move there, and local development corporations who can use the money for local infrastructure thereby creating balanced communities. The South East is overcrowded and current development priorities just make that worse. They are levelling down not levelling up. We will protect and maintain the green belt.\nOn social housing I am restoring the full housing benefit which will become affordable again as immigration falls. This will allow housing associations access to the City for development finance, and I shall be adding a government guarantee to help reduce borrowing costs. We will continue to support Right to Buy as it does not reduce total housing available but I am halving the discounts.\nFollowing the Grenfell Tower Tragedy many leaseholders have become trapped with spiralling service charges which they cannot pay. I am therefore limiting service charge increases to inflation backdated to the date of the tragedy, and will refund landlords forced into loss by this, subject to reasonable limits on insurance premiums and other costs.\nIn summary Mr. Speaker I anticipate that for the coming year tax increases and expenditure savings with bring in around £80 billion and tax reductions and expenditure increases cost around £20 billion, giving my target net saving of £60 billion. I am also placing a five and ten year Source and Application of Funds Statement in the library and online. So now it just remains for me to I thank the House for their patience and attention during this speech. It is a budget for working people and small businesses combined with a strategy to save Britain, and I commend it to the House.",
  "https_jepoynton_com_/https_jepoynton_com_2015_11_11_simon-heffer-gets-it-wrong-on-devaluation/content_46.html": "I seem to have found a new hobby – taking issue with Sunday Telegraph columnists! Last week it was Janet Daley and this week it is Simon Heffer, another redoubtable writer who often has interesting things to say but yesterday talked complete rubbish about devaluation. It was just a short piece so here’s what he said in full.\n“The latest thinking aloud by Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, tells us that he believes interest rates should not rise until 2017. He’s wrong: but he’s changed his mind several times before, and will doubtless do so again. His remarks cheer those who believe sterling should be devalued to help our competitiveness. But that would also be helped if we improved our productivity, surely a much better idea. Those demanding a weaker currency need to be asked how weak they’d like it to be. Would like the Weimar Republic be enough? Or do they want the full Zimbabwe?”\nNO, Simon, you cannot force the pace of productivity growth! In a free market economy it is simply the result of myriad decisions made by private individuals and companies. The best you can do is set optimum conditions for investment. To do that you have to stimulate consumer demand so companies have an expanding market to invest into, otherwise they won’t take the risk. But guess what? Even if we achieve this, our competitors are likely to be investing just as fast as we are. So we never catch up! Getting rid of an ingrained massive Balance of Payments deficit such as we have, which has the dire effect of exporting jobs, can only be achieved by devaluation.\nOf course that is not easy, and you are right to point out the possible inflationary consequences. Inflation simply undoes all the good work and sets you back to square one. But it is not inevitable. Remember the Exit From The ERM? That was one of the most effective devaluations on record because it came when unemployment was very high so the inflationary impact was completely absorbed. As a result we got ten years of solid export-led economic growth.\nThe lesson here is that the best time to devalue is during a recession. Once again Osborne has failed to fix the roof while the sun has been shining (from that perspective), just as he has done by failing to set up a Sovereign Wealth Fund. However the global recession now developing may give us a second chance. Osborne should ask Mr. Carney and Treasury officials to put together a plan of action to get our BoP back into a small surplus within five years. To answer your question, that’s how weak (I prefer the term ‘competitive’) it needs to be.\nWhich leads us to consider what options may be open for this. What after all has caused the over-valuation in the first place? As you may have seen in my earlier post on Greece, the Eurozone and World Trade, a large part of the problem arises from the fact that capital flows through the foreign exchanges now swamp trading flows, so that the natural effect of having to finance a deficit no longer has a stabilising effect on our exchange rate. Thomas Piketty, in his recent book, observed that capital to GDP ratios have now risen to about seven, having been only around two at the end of WW2. It is a problem that affects the entire globe, and is the main reason why the Doha round disintegrated.\nBut it also gives us a clue as to the solution – to act on those capital flows directly. A bonus from setting up a Sovereign Wealth Fund would be that much of it would be invested overseas, thereby selling Sterling and making it more competitive. We also have at present very high levels of inward investment, which has the opposite and counter-productive effect. Partly this is due to Russian oligarchs and far eastern millionaires using the UK as a safe haven for their money (I have elsewhere advocated a big increase in stamp duty on foreign buyers of UK domestic property), but it is also due to the encouragement by successive governments of inward investment for infrastructure and industry. I say that is counter-productive and should stop. We will gain far more jobs from a competitive exchange rate that we do from mountains of inward investment.\nAnd here’s a further twist. A failure to agree a new trade deal with the EU after exit could be a blessing in disguise. Just suppose that, in a fit of pique, Brussels chose to cut off their nose to spite their face and refuse a deal. What would happen? Well they would raise tariffs on their imports from the UK, reducing our exports. But of course we would give as good as we got, reducing our imports from them, which are far greater. What we would lose on the export swings we would more than gain on the import-substitution roundabouts. The deficit would be scaled back, and fewer jobs would be lost. Not only that, the import tariffs would provide useful extra fiscal revenue. A little bit of protectionism could be just what the doctor ordered!",
  "https_jepoynton_com_/https_jepoynton_com_2016_04_21_economic-consequesnces-of-brexit/content_59.html": "Herewith another letter to the editor of the Sunday Telegraph. He didn’t print the last one, so lets hope for better luck with this one!\nDear Sir,\nStephen Crabb’s piece last week in which he predicted economic Armageddon if we left the EU is typical of the genre. He uncritically and selectively quotes reports by alleged experts without reproducing or testing any underlying arguments. There is no such thing as an infallible expert, and these people may well be more interested in covering their backsides than in pursuing the truth.\nOne thing that is near certain is that we will gain a devaluation on Brexit, just like the exit from the ERM in 1992. That delivered about 10% additional competitiveness and laid the foundations for twelve years of strong economic growth, culminating in our economy becoming the fourth largest in the world. You also reported last week that we have already gained 4% since the referendum announcement, and that the CBI is reporting an upturn in exports (although how that squares with the government’s latest report that unemployment is rising I will leave to your readers’ imagination; a useful opportunity to correct the figures?).\nA 10% or more gain on devaluation is greater than on average any amount of tariffs the EU could throw at us. In other words we cannot lose, which means we do not need any new deal with the EU and that therefore the EU cannot prevent us from controlling our borders. The only uncertainty lies between gaining a little and gaining a lot.\nWe desperately need such an economic boost. It will not come from anywhere else. The export and import-substitution led recovery will increase demand, which will stimulate investment, which will introduce new technology, which will improve productivity, which will create economic growth, which will increase living standards. As in the 1990s it is a domino growth effect in which the first tile is now Brexit.\nThe truth is we cannot afford not to leave the European Union. He who dares wins.\nYours faithfully.\nPS. Although the editor has again failed to publish this letter, Charles Moore, a Telegraph columnist, makes the interesting point that the US has never had a free trade agreement with either the UK or the EU. Doesn’t seem to have held them back! So I repeat, we do not need any new agreement with the EU.\nPPS. I also like the cartoon from London University which I have shared on my facebook page showing a minister of George III telling the Americans they will BE STRONGER IN THE EMPIRE! Obama’s visit, clearly scripted by Downing Street (note use of the word ‘queue’), has not gone down well.",
  "https_jepoynton_com_/https_jepoynton_com_2023_03_16_the-budget-yawn/content_26.html": "Facing massive problems funding the budget deficit, record levels of structural unemployment, public sector wage claims, energy prices and national debt, a fragile bond market, an imminent recession and negative growth, the Chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, simply froze in the headlights.\nA budget for growth it was not, given the forecast recession, but just possibly it might have eased that recession a fraction, so I am not going to carp over some pretty minor spending increases. It’s his strategy, or lack of it, I worry about.\nTake the issue of childcare support for working mothers. He chooses to spend an additional £4bn on professional child carers. Leaving aside the age-old concerns about separating mothers from their new-born children, surely a much better and cheaper solution is Single Parent Circles. In this a social worker organises five single parents to form a group in which one looks after the children while the others go out to work and pay across a fifth of their earning to the first. Apart from the social worker it doesn’t cost the taxpayer a penny. You could even take it a step further and rehouse all five of them in a single large house where they will also get the mutual emotional support they need.\nObtusely Hunt has picked up on the problem of record unemployment (only about 10% of those of working age unemployed are benefit claimants), of which about 17% claim it is due to lack of affordable child care, but he has completely ignored the root cause of it all which is open borders. The points-based immigration system is supposed to exclude anyone who cannot earn a living in this country, but because Big Business prefers younger, cheaper, trained workers these are simply displacing older or untrained British workers and the result is the same. Only a switch to an auctioned quota system for total immigration will solve this. If we can reduce unemployment by 5% (8% to 3%) that in itself would save the Treasury over £100bn.\nAnd just a point on immigration whilst I am on it. Total gross immigration is now around 75,000 a month. Of these ‘only’ around 5000 are illegals and refugees, and another 5000 could generously be attributed to people with rare skills and experience we cannot generate here. The rest, 65,000 of them, are simply cheap labour. They are undermining our economy, not benefitting it. Indeed, look at the GDP per capita growth rates over the past 22 years. They show a steady and persistent decline. No benefit whatsoever showing up as a result of massive immigration!\nBut back to the budget. No further relief for business from energy costs – that could cause havoc during a recession. But the main argument is over growth, with the Tories still stubbornly insisting that massive tax cuts are required to create economic growth. Wrong – it is investment that does that. Investment in productivity is uniquely being undermined in this country by three factors – the still ever-increasing trade deficit with the EU, open borders as above, and what I call ‘impotent’ investment, in other words the amount of available investment funding going into pushing up house prices rather than productivity. The Bank of England must be instructed to manage house price inflation separately from general inflation so as to squeeze available funding back towards industry. No need for tax cuts – and in any case there has been no shortage of funds in the City recently desperately searching for yield.\nBut what I found particularly amusing on Newsnight last night was Jacob Rees-Mogg pointing out that the Irish raise more in corporation tax (presumably % of GDP) than we do despite have a rate of only 12.5%, which he used to present a sort of Laffer-curve argument for cutting taxes. Presumably a logical extrapolation of this would lead to the conclusion that zero tax rates would result in infinite tax revenues? A reductio in absurdum, methinks!\nBut the real point Jacob has missed is that the Irish are taxing profits generated in the UK but booked in the Republic via transfer pricing. This is just another example of how the Bond Villains of Davos have their sticky mits in our till. Until we tax multinationals on the basis on their global profits apportioned by turnover they will continue to get away with it.",
  "https_jepoynton_com_/https_jepoynton_com_2015_08_20_constitutional-reform/content_68.html": "Am I the only person in the country to think that an elected House of Lords is a thoroughly bad idea? I suppose I am coming at this with my professional management consultancy hat on, under which I advise that it would destroy single-point accountability by Parliament as a whole. The House of Commons and the House of Lords are essentially doing the same job; creating our laws and managing the statute book. What happens when something goes wrong? Who would you blame? For as sure as eggs is eggs each of your two elected members would blame the other! It is recipe for buck passing and unresolvable chaos.\nNor is it necessary. As Confucius once say, it only takes one link in a chain to break and the whole chain is broken. In other words it only takes one House to be democratically accountable and Parliament as a whole is democratically accountable. Making the House of Lords elected as well adds nothing. Except chaos. I would rather abolish the House of Lords altogether than make it elected.\nBut then the House of Lords does have an important role to play as a revising chamber. It is a bit like the quality control stage at the end of the production line. To do that job effectively you need people with talent and experience. Unfortunately talent and experience are seldom high priorities in an election, and indeed there is rightly no requirement for a representative to have them. People generally go for someone local or with a similar background to themselves. To acquire people with talent and experience you need an appointment system.\nThe only question is: who does the appointing? The problem we have at present is that the House of Lords is the private fiefdom of the Prime Minister of the day. He can, and does, stuff it with as many of his own party cronies as he can get away with. Even then we seldom get people with talent and experience! I don’t actually have a problem with the size of the membership, as members tend to attend only when they feel they have something to contribute. Given the almost infinitely wide range of subjects involved, a wide range of members and interests is a benefit if not indeed essential.\nI accept that the person or group doing the appointing must themselves be democratically accountable; all that is necessary is that they are independent from Parliament. I also observe that in fact there are a number of functions and issues in which Parliament itself has too much of a vested interest. How about these for starters?\n• The Judiciary\n• The Armed Forces\n• Granting of the Royal Assent (as a purely constitutional compliance matter)\n• The Honours system\n• MPs’ pay and conditions\n• The Boundaries Commission\n• The Parliamentary Commissioner\n• The National Audit Office\n• The Office for National Statistics\n• The Office for Budget Responsibility\n• In fact all constitutional matters and matters that should be kept independent from politicians generally.\nMy proposal is that we elect a quite separate Constitutional Council – it needn’t be large – perhaps just a dozen or so regional members with a minority of co-opted law lords as well, and perhaps chaired by the Lord Chancellor, who would be elected from within their own number – to take responsibility for a written constitution as well as for the above responsibilities.\nIn my book a sovereign constitution is about the institutions and procedures necessary to uphold democracy. It would not incorporate anything such as a bill of rights as that properly belongs on the statute book. Thus Parliament would be responsible for the Statute Book, and the Constitutional Council for the Constitution. Two quite separate tasks and documents which do not overlap.\nNone of this would adversely affect the monarchy, of which I am a strong supporter. An elected president could never provide the continuity and experience that all the Queen’s prime ministers, on both sides of the political divide, say they valued so much from their weekly audiences with the Queen. Nor does the monarch have any absolute powers. She has the right to be informed, and the right to advise, and that’s it. Everything else she does she does on the advice of her ministers. As a result democratic accountability is simply not relevant.\nHowever, regrettably, we have so undermined the authority of the monarch over the past century that she can no longer act in any proactive way as custodian of the constitution. This profound weakness in our current arrangements was notoriously brought into focus by the adoption of the Lisbon Treaty. If a Constitutional Council had been in place it could have advised HM not to grant the Royal Assent to that Bill, at least pending a referendum in accordance with a written constitution, and no-one would have thought that undemocratic. Changes to the constitution itself could also require a referendum. They should not need to be frequent.\nFinally I would advise that a written constitution should require all foreign treaties to contain a five-year break clause. These could default to a continuation, but the point here is that it should not be possible for one Parliament to bind its successors. I would also personally favour a clause prohibiting the courts from awarding financial compensation for non-financial loss. After all, life and limb are priceless.",
  "https_jepoynton_com_/https_jepoynton_com_2019_05_26_steel/content_15.html": "It is disingenuous of Greybull, the owners of British Steel, to blame Brexit for their losses. They had already lost £19m in the year to March 2018 long before delays to Brexit were even announced. The company had been profitable as recently as 2017.\nThe real reasons are firstly the EU’s refusal to grant the company its proper quota of emissions trading licenses until Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement has been passed, and secondly China’s increased dumping of inefficiently produced steel onto world markets following Donald Trump’s imposition of tariffs.\nOnce we are out of the EU (properly – without any sort of ‘free-trade’ deal either before or after – that would just increase our deficit as any mathematician could tell you) we can either ditch the emissions trading scheme or ensure that British Steel uses a green energy supplier. The green taxes can be removed because green energy is now cheaper than fossil fuel energy. Panic over. That will reduce British Steel’s costs significantly.\nSecondly we can impose our own import tariffs after Brexit. We have a massive trade deficit with the other EU countries which we must turn around and eliminate if we are to recover economic growth. That requires import tariffs which a No Deal Brexit will enable to prevent dumping as well as manage our trade balance.\nSteel is not a dying industry. There is huge demand for it both in this country and potentially as exports. Investment in it makes a lot of sense. New technology is currently available and continues to develop alongside artificial intelligence. Yes, that will lead to a gradual loss of jobs, but there is no need for a cliff-edge collapse now. We can nationalise or part-nationalise the company just as we did with the banks. That was in fact very successful with the benefit of hindsight. The capital came from QE and the taxpayer profited from the rise in the share price.\nI am not suggesting that the taxpayer or QE fork out for the new investment required. That way lies inflation, as they have discovered most recently in Venezuela. It worked for the banks because it was offsetting a fall in the money supply due to the writing off of bad debts (and also, it is now apparent, the financing of our rapidly increasing trade deficit with the EU). A new share issue can be raised for that if the investment is genuinely viable, and the City is in the best position to judge that. Either way new management is needed.\nFinally Brexit will enable us to put in place a proper regional policy aimed at achieving an even level of percentage employment across the land. Those released from work as technology raises living standards generally can then find new jobs much more easily. It just needs to be given time.\nThe only reason green energy is cheaper than fossil fuel is because of carbon taxing. Also green energy is nonsense because it is unreliable. The UK is now at risk of electricity shortages because we have turned our backs on reliable on-demand sources of energy, coal, gas, and nuclear. Renewables can only ever be additional because you need continuous rated base load.\nIf you cannot support the use of fossil fuels I cannot support you in the leadership contest.\nLikeLike\nHave a look at the reply I have just given to Richard Lark. I agree with what you say about costs and risks and will certainly commit to not decommissioning fossil fuel generation until we know economic green generation is available. We must not shoot ourselves in the foot in a panic. Our little contribution to greenhouse gasses (and I am not going to get into the science of all this as different sets of scientists are saying different things – my instinct is that the truth lies somewhere in between – we have just been told by another scientist that the Great Barrier Reef has record levels of coral cover!) is insignificant in global terms, so my approach is to make progress towards Net Zero where we can in a reasonable manner, and if that means missing the 2050 target so be it.\nLikeLike",
  "https_jepoynton_com_/https_jepoynton_com_2018_08_24_has-jeremy-warner-seen-the-light/content_31.html": "I started to think so last weekend as I read his column in the Sunday Telegraph business section. Each week Warner provides a Remainer view while on the same page Liam Halligan gives a Leave perspective. I always read both as I enjoy the challenge of debunking Warner’s arguments, but this week I found him saying some things which are undoubtedly correct.\nFirst he acknowledged that we have a massive and increasing current account (trade) deficit. He also saw that this is being funded, in foreign currency, by massive capital inflows, causing an increase in the value of the pound making it less competitive. He noted the devaluation since the referendum and the consequent small reversal in the deficit, but was inclined to attribute the reduction in the deficit more to the buoyant international economy than to devaluation. He then observed that many manufacturers had scaled back investment since the referendum, and even acknowledged this may simply due to uncertainty and concluded by admitting to a degree of uncertainty himself. None-the-less, he stuck to his Remainian position!\nWhat he failed to point out of course was that all and more of our current account deficit is entirely and solely due to our trade with the other EU countries, as shown in this graph. Our trade with the Rest of the World is actually in surplus. So why the divergence?\nHe is probably right to observe that our exchange rate is not hugely over-valued, otherwise why would our trade outside the EU be so successful? Nor can it due to tariffs as there aren’t any within the Single Market. He also failed to point out that under-investment and the consequent ‘productivity gap’ goes back to the banking crisis and the start of QE, rather than just to the referendum.\nI covered this point in my recent facebook post in response to an IEA podcast, and concluded that the only possible cause of the EU deficit is that over the past twenty years Brussels has methodically and surreptitiously been piling up a great stack of regulations and other non-tariff barriers against us. Whether this has been by design or by accident I leave you to ponder! Either way it means that we must recover control over our terms of trade if we are to have any chance of reversing the deficit and thereby avoiding a massive recession when people can’t borrow any more. That is only possible through a No-Deal (WTO terms) Brexit. Any sort of deal with the EU will lock us into this disastrous trend. Even so, it will take many years of painstaking work to unravel these non-tariff barriers. In the meantime tariffs on both sides of the Channel will help to reduce the deficit and create jobs as people revert to buying British rather than foreign, and the Treasury will have a further £25bn or so of import tariff revenues to help with the fiscal position. Exports are likely still to thrive as devaluation at around 12% is far greater than the average tariffs we will face. We would also have the money to subsidise any exports facing tariffs in excess of 10% if we wish. See also my facebook page for a description of how the max-fac import system could work – it does not require any software investment by industry at all!\nIt is the re-starting of QE together with consequent record levels of personal debt which gives the game away. The Treasury don’t want you to know this as they were facing a big problem in financing the trade deficit domestically before the referendum. They were under pressure to increase interest rates and restart savings and growth. It is not just about paying import bills in foreign currency; it is also the fact that if both we and foreigners are buying more foreign stuff instead of British then unemployment will rise.\nIf it really is the case, which traditionalists will argue, that the capital inflows will convert into job-creating investment by industry then why restart QE? The reality is that most of those inflows are simply going into the property market and inflating other assets.\nSo the Treasury were delighted when they could blame the referendum for the restart of QE, when in reality it had nothing to do with the referendum and everything to do with financing our EU trade deficit. They could even wave their arms about and point to a reduction in unemployment and record job numbers when in fact all they had done was puff up the economy using QE. But in truth it is a con as such a policy is unsustainable. Who will be around when these chickens come home to roost?\nFinally a comment on the position of the other parties. Labour, entirely in keeping with their historic and somewhat tenuous relationship with the science of economics, say, as we do, that they want to protect jobs; and then get the technical argument completely back-to-front! It is the No-Deal Brexit which will create and protect jobs, not any deal with the EU as they favour. Neither should we fall into the arms of Jacob Rees-Mogg, who looks forward to eliminating import tariffs on food, clothing and shoes. This is Jacob’s very own magic money tree! Yes of course we would all like lower import prices, but as everyone then buys more foreign than British unemployment will rise. It is the balance of trade that matters, not the volume or the level of import tariffs.\nAs with the ERM and the Euro, once again only UKIP gets it right!",
  "https_jepoynton_com_/https_jepoynton_com_author_jepoynton_page_6/content_28.html": "Probably the most frequent questions I was asked during the recent campaign concerned the NHS. And it wasn’t just about funding, an issue I addressed in an earlier article. People were concerned about the way it is being managed, its inefficiency, and about the outsourcing of NHS services to the private sector.\nAs it happens, early on in the campaign I attended a seminar addressed by Simon Stevens, the Chief Executive of NHS England, and I asked him for the staff turnover figures for doctors and nurses across the NHS, and for the percentage of staff who were on temporary contracts. He avoided giving me any figures. Whether this was because he did not want to, or because he did not know them I am not sure, so I went on to ask why his board did not include any resource-specialist directors such a Human Resources Director, Finance Director (although there is someone they rather begrudgingly call their chief financial officer), IT Director or Facilities Director. How, I asked, could he be held responsible for the performance of the NHS without such a board. He immediately replied that he could not!\nNow I have no reason to suppose he was just being flippant in giving this reply. I suspect the real reason is that his brief is not one of chief executive that we in the private sector would recognise. Which in turn means that there is no one properly in charge. It is rather like a manufacturing company where the MD has five production directors and a bookkeeper! Clearly it is impossible for such a board to keep tabs on all the resources within the organisation, of which its staff are its most important. No wonder we end up with a health service where the supply of doctors and nurses cannot keep up with demand, where staff turnover has gone through the roof, where a high proportion are expensive agency staff, and where half of those cannot speak English anyway. It came as no surprise therefore when a debate erupted after the election about the shortage of doctors and nurses in the NHS!\nAnother concern frequently expressed was how difficult it is to find anyone in the NHS capable of taking the initiative and making decisions. It would appear that the top-down prescriptive, target-orientated management methodology introduced by Tony Blair’s New Labour government is still in place. The whole thing is upside down. You want your doctors and nurses at the sharp end dealing with the patients and doing the research. They are then in a position to propose the changes and budgets necessary drive their own local units forward in response to the needs of their patients. The role of the board is three-fold: to assess these initiatives, to provide the resources they require, and to monitor the use of all resources across the NHS so as to maximise utilisation and efficiency. That just not appears to be happening at present. I accept that there may also be a need for some central initiatives as well, but not at the expense of the reactive ones.\nAlmost all of our public services are conglomerate in nature; that is they comprise groups of units operating at specialist or local level and accountable through central management to their ultimate owners, Parliament. The most successful method of managing conglomerates is technique perfected by Arnold Weinstock at GEC during the 60s, 70s and 80s which I call comparative management by results. Weinstock famously used just seven key financial indicators (they would of course be different and more diverse in the public sector, but the principle is the same) to compare the performance of all the subsidiaries in the group, and then started kicking arse from the bottom of the list upwards. These numbers aren’t good enough, he would bellow down the line. You are in the bottom half of the list. What are you going to do about it? I want your proposals on my desk by Friday lunchtime” or whatever. If they could improve well and good, but if they could not they were replaced. It was as simple as that.\nCompare this approach to that taken by New Labour, which I call ‘top down prescriptive methodology’. “Tick these boxes. Follow these procedures. Meet these targets. Do it this way and stick your head in the sand while you’re at it”! Weinstock never told his MDs how to do their job; these were expensive, experience people who should already know that; it was what he was paying them for. He was only interested in results. His only other major role was to accumulate and allocate capital funds for investment, and if he could get a better return elsewhere he did so. His ‘cash mountain’ became famous.\nThe difference between the two approaches is striking, but what is also telling is that Weinstock seldom if ever got involved directly with his customers or even with what they were actually buying from GEC. That was all delegated; in other words ‘localised’. Even more so is the role and importance of central management. Weinstock’s head office was tiny. I went there once, just a five story terraced building in Stanhope Gate, but it was only by having a central team that he was able to manage the company in this way.\nIt is also worth noting that New Labour’s approach was to set absolute targets. This may have been politically convenient, but has the drawback that any target will have a resourcing implication, and if that implication is not addressed then the result will be chaos, which of course is precisely what happened. Weinstock’s approach on the other hand was comparative. He knew what was possible by looking at the companies at the top of the list, and simply expected the others to do as well. And when you think about it, this is precisely how an open competitive market works; the choices available to consumers are comparative both in price (efficiency) and quality.\nNow look at what is actually happening out there! We keep hearing of schools and hospitals being ‘put into special measures’, which involves drafting in a whole raft of interim managers, none of whom know anything about the organisation they going in to manage, none of whom will be there in a year’s time or have any permanent commitment to it, and all of whom are being paid massive fees. I saw one case recently where ten such managers had been drafted into a hospital, all of whom were being paid in excess of £100k pa, and the chief honcho at a rate in excess of £500k pa! OMG! What a total and utter waste of time and public money. All you have to do is change the guy in charge and then support him.\nBut if you thought that was bad enough, look at Social Services. They don’t have anyone in charge at all. They are quite literally running around like headless chickens. It’s all very well to say that such services are run by local authorities, but the money comes from central government and when things go wrong we expect ministers to take responsibility. Local authorities are simply not physically in a position to make the comparative assessments required or allocate resources according to demand.\nI suspect the source of the problem lies in the structure of the spending departments themselves. How many of them have a clear structural separation between their advisory side, with its responsibility to advise ministers of current problems and future needs, and their executive side, with its responsibility to deliver a mandate approved by Parliament? Taking it from the top therefore, I would expect to see:-\n– A National Director General / Chief Executive (DG) for each and every public service reporting directly to the relevant Secretary of State and his Permanent Secretary. There could be several within a given department depending on the breadth of that department’s responsibilities.\n– The advisory side of the department organized on a pool basis, such as you would find in a firm of accountants or solicitors, managed through the use of timesheets, project budgets and activity percentages, and run by an Under-Secretary.\n– Each DG having a board of directors covering the full range of functional responsibilities, including HR, Finance, IT, Facilities, internal audit and inspection, and others as may be appropriate, with the Executive side structured on a traditional hierarchical basis.\n– Every level of management under the DG having the power to hire and fire the next level down. This is essential for both authority and accountability.\n– A comprehensive quarterly Management Information System (MIS) covering all key performance and efficiency indicators across the service, including management accounts, enabling comparisons to be made and follow-up action taken where necessary. It is important to emphasise that these indicators are not targets, simply monitoring procedures. It is often said that a good MIS only poses questions; it does not provide answers.\n– Each DG having full and complete autonomy over the allocation of his budget, with no ring-fencing or other restrictions. To the extent that Parliament has decreed certain levels of provision within the service, these should simply be monitored through the MIS.\n– The Board including a non-exec Customer Representative, to whom local governors and customer representatives can report on a functional basis. Each local board would have a similar position, possibly elected locally. Our manifesto commitment for elected county representatives fitted this requirement neatly.",

  "https_jepoynton_com_/https_jepoynton_com_tag_finance/content_4.html": "Mr. Speaker, it is an honour and a privilege for me to have this opportunity to present to the House the government’s budget for the coming year.\nAs the House will already know, our economy and government finances are in a desperate and sorry state. Over the past nearly 25 years we have suffered a series of setbacks that have enveloped us in a perfect storm, starting with our membership of the European Union Single Market which has seen our trade balance with those countries plummet from having been broadly in balance to a deficit at the time of the Brexit Referendum of £109 billion; that’s 6% of GDP at that time. This has presented British business with a contracting market. Generally speaking business will not invest into a contracting market, with the result that productivity growth has suffered.\nThen we had the banking crisis, triggered by an oil price spike in 2007 which led to the default of many sub-prime mortgages in the USA and which our banks had invested into. But there were also collapses on this side of the pond such as Northern Rock and HBOS which were simply due to over-trading, and that can only be due to a failure of regulation here. One bright spot then arises as the banks were quickly recapitalised through the use of quantitative easing, which did not on that occasion produce inflation as it was merely replacing credit which had been destroyed in the crisis. Unfortunately later on the QE was restarted with inevitable inflationary consequences.\nOn top of all that we had austerity and the failure to start a Sovereign Wealth Fund when interest rates hit the floor. Mr. Speaker, I am sure that most members are aware that 5% compounded will quadruple your money within 30 years, and 7% double it within ten. Over the past thirty years returns on many foreign shares have been far greater than the cost of government borrowing here. That is because the rate of growth in many other countries has been far faster than it has been here and is likely to continue that way for some time to come. It must make sense for us to benefit from their success in this way. A golden opportunity completely missed.\nThen we come to Brexit which some today are blaming for all our financial woes. Mr. Speaker, I do not accept that analysis but instead that the Trade and Co-operation Agreement has locked us into the catastrophic trade deficit we inherited from the Single Market. It is not enough to secure no tariffs in either direction when there are a host of other regulations creating the imbalance, and we need the use of tariffs to counter that effect. That will almost certainly mean scrapping the TCA, and whilst trade volumes may fall, the much greater effect of import substitution will present British business at home with the expanding market they crave to invest and create productivity growth and jobs.\nFollowing that we had Covid and the energy crisis caused by the war in Ukraine, thankfully temporarily as Russia has found other outlets into the international oil markets, and all of the panic over climate change. And if that weren’t enough mass immigration, quite apart from increasing cultural conflict within the country, has condemned wages to minimum levels, undermined working conditions and caused record levels of unemployment and homelessness. And to cap it all, we have an ageing population pushing the cost of pensions and health care through the roof. Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear!\nNow, Mr. Speaker, it is not my intention to spend time trying to apportion blame for this situation. Many of these circumstances were beyond our control, and for others it is easy to be wise after the event. My purpose is to identify the causes so we can take appropriate action to remedy them and to quantify the task itself. Our National Debt is now close to 100% of GDP after having been nearly paid off a quarter of a century ago, and the cost of interest on that debt is now over £100 billion a year, nearly 4% GDP in itself, and rising. The total fiscal deficit is around £170 billion and that is adding to the Debt all the time. It is imperative, Mr. Speaker, that we get our nose ahead of the game so that we can reverse the whole process.\nMy strategy is based on three key objectives necessary to provide a tripod of stability for our recovery. First I aim to achieve a fiscal surplus of 1% GDP within five years. Second I want a trade surplus of 1% GDP by that time, and third we must achieve net zero immigration as well. Add to that some essential tax cuts to motivate growth and expenditure increases to avoid imminent collapse of some public services and we are looking at an annual fiscal turnaround of £300 billion by the end of our first five years.\nOn average I must save £60 billion in each of the next five years, but that is only on average. There are couple of policies which can raise substantial funds in excess of this amount up front, while others such as revived economic growth will be weighted towards the end. The good news is that over the following five years those trends should lead to a much greater turnaround of around £450 billion or more, with much greater scope for both tax cuts and expenditure increases, which I shall aim broadly to keep equal. I shall also aim to cut the total level of taxation down to 30% GDP, whereas currently it is around 37%, all the while maintaining fiscal and trade surpluses of 1% GDP. History shows that all the economies with the highest rates of economic growth have run Balance of Payments surpluses and I am determined the UK should be in that group.\nSo, Mr. Speaker, let me make a start.\nMy first port of call is multinational corporations, which have long had a habit of shifting their profits into tax havens, or semi tax havens such as the Republic of Ireland, to avoid corporation tax in this country. Now I accept that at 25% our rate of corporation tax is too high, and I shall return to that later, but for now may I completely reject the argument that this country must somehow engage in a race to bottom just to remain competitive. There are other ways we can regulate our trade balance, and in any case if were able to collect what is morally due to us, profits made out purchases by the good citizens of this country, that would provide the funds to reduce it.\nOver ten years ago now, the G8 at its summit in Enniskillen tasked the OECD with ending this practice. They have completely failed to do so and show no signs of any significant progress as they just kick the can further on down the road. Clearly the multinationals have got to them! We cannot afford to wait any longer.\nThe good news is that this is very easy to rectify. Henceforth multinationals, which we shall define as any company that has more than 10% of its turnover in more than one country, shall be taxed on the basis of their global profits, as declared to their shareholders and in the public domain, and apportioned to this country by turnover, including non-domestic intercompany sales. They may be able to shift their head offices and their intellectual property rights, but they cannot shift their customers! It is difficult to forecast accurately without an established database exactly how much additional revenue this will raise, but our best estimates suggest it could be within the range of £40 to 50 billion if not more.\nSecond, Mr. Speaker, I am abolishing Inheritance Tax. It is a very inefficient tax, raising only about a third of 1% GDP; is double taxation in the hands of the deceased; uses up a disproportionate amount of tax legislation and consequently distracts the attention of thousands of lawyers and accountants who should be more constructively engaged.\nHowever I recognise that a society in which around 2% of the population own 80% of its assets is not a healthy one. I want to reduce this wealth gap but not eliminate it. It remains important that those with energy, ability and enterprise can profit from them for the benefit of us all. In practice however much of this accumulated wealth is passive asset appreciation.\nI therefore aim to raise about 2% GDP by charging legacies to capital gains tax in the hands of beneficiaries. This would require a 50% withholding tax to counter avoidance, but which would be repaid, with interest, when the gains are presented for assessment. I do not propose to introduce a wealth tax, which would also be double taxation in the hands of the taxpayer as well as very difficult to collect as much of it would disappear into overseas trusts and corporate structures.\nCapital gains will be assessed to income tax at the taxpayer’s marginal rate with no additional allowances. However I am allowing it to be spread over ten years so that poorer beneficiaries can use up more of their allowances and lower rate bands. This reflects the rule-of-thumb PE ratio of 10 often used to value small companies.\nExisting roll-over reliefs from inheritance tax such as for farms and businesses will be maintained and I am adding relief for the repayment of any student loans, not necessarily those of the taxpayer. Tax on occupied primary residences, again not necessarily by the taxpayer or his family, such as a sitting tenant, may be deferred until that occupant leaves.\nI am also abolishing Non-Dom status, but replacing it with a flat cap on income tax, including capital gains, of £250,000 in any one year.\nThese two changes alone should raise around £80 billion a year. I am not seeking to raise any other taxes. I am however reintroducing marginal relief from corporation tax for small businesses with a zero rate allowance of one million and a lower rate band of two million. The lower rate will be half the full rate which remains at 25%. In the longer term I aim to reduce taxation to 30% GDP and increase the personal tax allowance to match the typical minimum wage at £20,000, and reduce the top rate to 40%. I may also introduce an intermediate rate at 30%.\nMr. Speaker I now come to a series of changes focused on reducing the burden on the taxpayer without endangering essential public services by focusing on efficiency and alternative sources of finance.\nBetter late than never I am introducing a Sovereign Wealth Fund which will be funded by borrowing at an interest rate not greater than 5% and at an amount, if available in the gilts markets, of 1% GDP a year. The asset will offset the liability and therefore have no effect on net debt. This will be farmed out to multiple professional fund managers with after time the more successful attracting greater contributions.\nIn addition I am starting the funding of a new state pension. This necessarily must be a gradual and prolonged process which will not have any significant effect on the public finances for many years. It will be available only to those under the age of 25 on 6th April next year and will be optional. Modelling suggests it will primarily benefit those on above average salaries, thereby halving in due course the number in the existing state pension. This in turn may allow us to improve the existing state pension significantly. For those who opt in, the existing employee national insurance contribution of 8% becomes a national pension contribution and is placed in an account in their name to which a guaranteed 4% interest as added annually. Of the three parameters of contribution rate, retirement age and pension amount, they will have the flexibility to fix any two and get a quote for the third. They may opt in or change these parameters at a later date, subject to not reducing the pension to an annuity equivalent below the level that would trigger entitlement to pension credits, and their remaining entitlement to the existing state pension will be determined by the number of years’ contributions in the existing way. This will create a fully flexible and transferable pension scheme which is currently unavailable to many, including those who switch employment between the public and private sectors. The money will physically go into the Sovereign Wealth Fund, which should get a better return for carrying risk, and will be part of its 1% GDP per annum funding target.\nMr. Speaker I am also introducing a National Credit Card. The purpose of the card is to give all citizens access to the private sector for essential services such as health and education on a means-tested basis. Just taking the health and schools budgets alone costs the taxpayer around £250 billion a year. If 50% used the private sector instead, and the average means-tested support for fees was also 50%, then the saving to the taxpayer would be over £60 billion a year.\nWe shall have to introduce this gradually to enable the supply side to meet increasing demand and it will be optional. Users pay for services in the normal way but do not have to settle the card at the end of the month. Instead after the end of the year when the taxman assesses your tax he will also review how much you have spent on your card, put the two together and recharge your share of the cost to your tax bill for the following year. Working capital will come from the Sovereign Wealth Fund at 5% which will be added to your costs from the date of purchase, but users will be able to pay on account to avoid it. The means test rate will be a simple percentage set at the beginning of each fiscal year for each user set in due course to encourage 50% usage. Much of these savings will then be available to improve the state services, and the fact that the private sector is accessible to all will remove any stain of privilege that some attribute to it at present.\nMr. Speaker, with the help of my RH colleagues I am taking a number of measures to improve efficiency within our public services. First we shall be splitting the civil service clean in two so that the advisory side, which advises ministers on current problems and future legislation, becomes completely separate and independent from the executive side, which delivers services mandated by Parliament. Two completely separate functions requiring separate organisational structures. This way the advisory side can assist ministers in holding the executive side to account.\nSecond we shall be appointing a national chief executive with the power to hire and fire local chief executives for every national public service. It is an extraordinary fact that currently few if any of our public services actually have any top management at all. No wonder they are all running around like headless chickens being hopelessly inefficient.\nThese chief executives will be mandated to ensure that sufficient trained British staff are recruited into each service, that they are paid the rate for the job so that staff turnover rates are minimised, and that agency and support staff are reduced to less than 25% of payroll each. I am also allowing staff bonuses to be paid out of 10% of any local budget savings or collected charges.\nThird, I am abolishing national wage bargaining in the tax funded public sector. Henceforth all such staff will be paid a full inflationary increase on 1st April each year. I reject the argument that this will create an inflationary wage spiral on the grounds both that there are no prices in this sector and that inflation increases the tax base anyway. But it is also important for staffing stability that all staff are paid the rate for the job, which will vary by skill and location across the country with additional increases awarded locally and which therefore cannot be addressed on a national basis.\nThese measures taken together could save another £30 billion a year as well as ensure they are no longer dependent on immigration for staff.\nSpeaking of immigration, my RH friend the Home Secretary will be scrapping the current points-based system and replacing it with an auctioned reducing quota system so that total immigration is reduced to below emigration rates within five years. It is therefore vital that we are able to reduce unemployment at the same or faster rate. Indeed we currently have over 3% job vacancies across our economy which is roughly double historical norms and only serves to suck in yet more immigrants. I shall therefore be instructing the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee henceforth to use a composite 4% target when setting interest rates; that is 2% inflation plus 2% job vacancies. I anticipate this will mean interest rates will remain at around the 5% mark for the foreseeable future, which is necessary anyway to encourage savings and fund investment, and will also probably be needed to contain the inflationary impact of wage rises in a tighter labour market. I shall be addressing the housing market separately in a few moments.\nIn addition I have a new regional policy designed to reduce the regional pay and unemployment gaps. It must make sense to focus stimulation to where unemployment is highest post code by post code across the country leading eventually to an even level of percentage employment across the land. This will increase income tax revenues and reduce welfare claims so it is likely to be fiscally neutral in the longer term.\nTo do so I shall cease funding new free tax and enterprise zones, which have a very chequered and uneven history, and instead introduce discounts for income tax, business rates and employers national insurance where the discount is proportionate to the local level of unemployment. For the coming year this discount will be 5% for every 1% that unemployment, measured on the claimant basis, is above 5%. We will review this algorithm annually to ensure a steady reduction in the regional gap.\nI also have a number of measures to free up the labour market to reduce structural unemployment. First I am repealing all IR35 legislation, which was designed to prevent employers avoiding the cost of national insurance contributions on permanent staff, by the simple measure of charging the invoices of self-employed and agency staff to NICs also. Professional fees will be exempt. The increased revenues will be used to reduce employers NICs for all so that the measure is fiscally neutral.\nIn any case I am immediately reducing employers NICs to 12% and increasing the minimum wage and universal credits in line with the triple lock on the state pension. I am also introducing marginal relief for employers NI with a zero alowance of £1000 per week of payroll, and a lower band of £2000 at a rate of half the full rate.\nSecond my RH friend the Work and Pensions Secretary will be undertaking a full post-implementation review of the introduction of Universal Credits with a view to making it simpler and more streamlined and efficient. In particular he will ensure that the thresholds for and rates of clawback are also universal, and that once vetted claimants do not have to reapply every time they get a gap between jobs. This is particularly important for self-employed people who currently often decline short term or low paid assignments because of the hassle and delays in reapplying.\nWithin this context I am increasing the threshold, or earnings disregard, for clawback of universal credits to £50 per week. This will create a much greater incentive for unemployed people to make that first leap back into employment, and will also allow low paid workers in the taper to keep more of what they themselves have earned. This will both reduce the poverty trap and the pressure on food banks many of which are struggling to obtain sufficient supplies.\nMr. Speaker, I now turn to support for farmers and care homes. At first sight they do not have much in common but they are both essential to our wellbeing, are competitive within the private sector and yet need financial support if they are to produce both food and care at affordable levels and remain profitable. Furthermore farmers are in competition with foreign imports which are heavily subsidised.\nFor both industries I am introducing a public subsidy at 10% on turnover. This will be subject to a profit cap at 5% before tax to prevent profiteering by larger businesses at the expense of both taxpayer and customer. The subsidy is designed to promote sales, and the profit cap will encourage competitive pricing and support greater expenditure. Qualifying directors remuneration will be restricted. In future years the rate of subsidy will be adjusted so that no more than 5% of businesses liquidate each year.\nMany businesses in a variety of industries receive public subsidies and there has been much concern at their profits. I am therefore extending the profit cap to all entities in receipt of public subsidy, though the cap may vary according to their capital investment requirements. I am also extending it proportionately to all companies with contracts with the public sector worth annually over 10% of their turnover.\nFinally Mr. Speaker I come to the housing market. I shall be reducing house prices from now on by between 1 and 2% a year on average. This is easily done by giving the Bank of England that target and by tightening criteria such as mortgage to value and income to mortgage used by commercial lenders.\nNow you may at first sight think that would make it more difficult for prospective purchasers to find and buy a new house, but in fact that is not so. For one thing the number of available houses out there does not change, and for another the supply is likely to increase because sellers will hurry to sell before prices reduce further. More importantly developers will no longer be able to make capital gains on their land banks and so can only build houses on them and sell them. In monetary terms the reduction in demand will be matched by a reduction is prices until all available houses are sold.\nThe misconstrued Help to Buy policy has just made matters worse, so I am in effect reversing it. Last year fewer new houses were built than before the policy was introduced over ten years ago and it has just pushed house prices even higher. Irrespective of whether we can balance supply and demand, the amount of credit tied up in the housing market means that house prices are likely to remain high. Yet house prices must come down if younger people are to buy when they get married and start a family and others to escape the parental nest and develop as independent adults.\nCurrently it takes on average over five years to build out a granted planning consent whereas no so long ago it was only two. It has been reported that there are hundreds of thousands of such consents gathering dust in the pending trays of property developers because they can make more money from capital gains. But it is important to understand also that they have themselves been squeezed by increasing land prices. As a result they have endeavoured to recoup their margins by resorting to dodgy practices such as denying buyers adequate snagging periods and tying them up into leaseholds with uncontrollable ground rent increases, and generally cutting costs and building to very low standards. Many such properties are now unsaleable. Mr. Speaker I am giving Help to Buy purchasers a new six month snagging period, with a survey at taxpayer’s expense to ensure objectivity, and with all restitution costs at the sellers expense.\nMy RH friend the Secretary of State for Housing, will be carrying out a full review of planning and related procedures including the possible repeal of the 1961 Land Compensation Act which gives 100% of all planning gain to landowners. We believe it may be more appropriate to divide planning gain equally between landowners, a national development corporation with powers of compulsory purchase to focus new development in the North where there are plentiful brownfield sites available, supported by regional policy which will encourage both people and jobs to move there, and local development corporations who can use the money for local infrastructure thereby creating balanced communities. The South East is overcrowded and current development priorities just make that worse. They are levelling down not levelling up. We will protect and maintain the green belt.\nOn social housing I am restoring the full housing benefit which will become affordable again as immigration falls. This will allow housing associations access to the City for development finance, and I shall be adding a government guarantee to help reduce borrowing costs. We will continue to support Right to Buy as it does not reduce total housing available but I am halving the discounts.\nFollowing the Grenfell Tower Tragedy many leaseholders have become trapped with spiralling service charges which they cannot pay. I am therefore limiting service charge increases to inflation backdated to the date of the tragedy, and will refund landlords forced into loss by this, subject to reasonable limits on insurance premiums and other costs.\nIn summary Mr. Speaker I anticipate that for the coming year tax increases and expenditure savings with bring in around £80 billion and tax reductions and expenditure increases cost around £20 billion, giving my target net saving of £60 billion. I am also placing a five and ten year Source and Application of Funds Statement in the library and online. So now it just remains for me to I thank the House for their patience and attention during this speech. It is a budget for working people and small businesses combined with a strategy to save Britain, and I commend it to the House.",
  "https_jepoynton_com_/https_jepoynton_com_page_2/content_9.html": "One of the joys of our new Whats App sites is that you can have a jolly good debate over important issues and, as long as it doesn’t get personal, which all good debaters avoid, make substantial progress in developing them.\nInevitably in the aftermath of Brexit the debate has turned to the position of the party on the political spectrum. Before it really didn’t matter too much as we were all united behind the common objective of getting Britain out of the European Union. We have members from all walks of life and background, but once the tide goes out you can see what’s below!\nOur constitution, clause 2.5, says we are a democratic libertarian party. Small ‘d’ and small ‘l’. It does not say, as some have claimed, that we are a Libertarian party, with a capital ‘L’. I don’t know how much thought went into the original wording? Perhaps not very much and they were just looking for something vaguely neutral. However it says what it says, so what does it mean and do we want to change it? I discovered a general reluctance to change the constitution, but I don’t think many realise quite what a Mad Dictator’s Charter we have been lumbered with. However I am not going to go into that here as I have covered it in a previous post.\nMy immediate reaction is that the words ‘democratic’ and ‘libertarian’ qualify each other. Traditional libertarian theory pretty much means no taxes and no government, at least in its American incarnation, where all taxation is regarded as theft and only those paying into the pot should be entitled to a vote. This was the position espoused by John Stuart Mill writing in the 1860s and based on the theories of classical economics. Since then of course John Maynard Keynes has produced his General Theory in which he introduced the concept of involuntary unemployment and observed that economic equilibrium can occur at less than full employment. Keynes’ view is now mainstream. More recently we have become familiar with the notion of dysfunctional markets where the imbalance of supply and demand is so great that the price mechanism no longer works, such as in housing or steel, and government intervention is required.\nMills’ theories are not redundant however, particularly in the realm of social justice, and Keynes himself was careful to stress that the classical laws of economics remain valid in normal conditions. As with Einstein’s general theory in physics, the classical laws only break down in extreme circumstances such as for matter approaching the speed of light or the interaction between subatomic particles. In fact I think Keynes was being a tad pompous in comparing himself with Einstein because by the time he was writing he was analysing a different ‘nature’ whereas Einstein was explaining more deeply the original nature. That is because during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries the introduction of a full franchise and the advent of trades unions meant that a resistance to the downward movement of wages had developed which was not there before.\nThe principle tenet of JS Mill’s philosophy that I adhere to is that of the ‘Tyranny of the Majority’. If the majority decides everything then nothing is left to the discretion of the individual or to minority rights. Classic examples were Labour’s disbandment of catholic adoption agencies and their insistence on single-stream comprehensive schools and persecution of independent schools. In neither case is there any overriding national interest involved; no need for uniformity across the land. The Socialist view is totalitarian ideology in which Big Sister knows best.\nA free society might be defined as one in which the domain of morality is greater than the scope of the law. A bit like concentric circles it is the size of the gap in between them. A free society requires respect for the law, and that will only occur if everyone is equal under it. The law is there to protect us from harm or loss by third parties, and to enable us to deal with confidence with second parties. It is not there to protect us from ourselves nor to coerce us into patterns of behaviour which are simply of convenience to the state. A free society requires a strong sense of moral responsibility and history shows that it not only requires one, it also breeds one. By comparison in the EU, where most laws are based on Napoleonic law, you can only do what the law permits you to do. Here it is the other way around. That is now threatened by incoming alien cultures to replace the threat posed by the EU.\nAll libertarians reject the tyranny of socialism, but how far to the right do you have to go to escape it? This depends on whether the majority of voters are socialist or libertarian, and I am quite sure the majority in this country are libertarian. Indeed I maintain that the word ‘democratic’ in ‘democratic libertarian’ places us firmly at the centre of the political spectrum pretty much by definition. That is where the votes are, and there is no point in taking an extremist position where there aren’t any. Activists in all parties like the simple clarity of extremist positions, but activists are not typical of the general population.\nSo we need a simple yardstick to say what government should be about and what it should leave to the discretion of the individual. I suggest that yardstick should be the concept of ‘national interest’ as assessed objectively by its very nature. For example there is clearly a national, or common interest in defence and equality under the law. That means we must raise sufficient taxes to pay for these things as a common good. It also introduces the concept of a transfer of wealth from rich to poor as our tax systems are progressive. The money could not be raised otherwise.\nOther areas of policy are more debatable, but I argue that there is no national interest in allowing an unemployable underclass to develop. Not only do you have to be educated but you also have to be fit and healthy to pursue and hold down a job, and you have to be free of such structural unemployment factors such as the poverty trap and skill and regional imbalances. So education, health, welfare and regional policy also qualify, and so on. Those who argue that all taxes are theft should try earning a living on a desert island. They only reason they can do so is because they are part of a society that provides them with the economic opportunities and framework of law in which to do so, so some recompense is surely only just. I also pointed out that I do not myself now pay tax! Every year I use savings to make additional pension contributions so as to keep my taxable income to within the personal allowance. I would be pretty pissed off if I lost my right to vote as a result!\nAt the start of our discussions I tried to quantify such a centre position by saying we should limit central government expenditure to 35% of GDP. After all we have just been through a general election where Labour wanted to increase it to over 40% yet at the same time we are struggling to balance the books with a pre-Covid deficit of around £40bn, or 2% GDP, when the OECD says central government is currently spending 33.5% GDP and many public services are clearly struggling. This drew some sharp intakes of breath in certain quarters. OK the constitution in Clause 2.5 does go on to say that we will “seek to diminish the role of the State and lower the burden of taxation on individuals and businesses”. I can go along with that provided we remember that the majority of people in this country clearly want decent public services and a reliable welfare state. That means focusing on efficiency and possibly also on alternative sources of finance. There are plenty of opportunities to do so as my policy contributions demonstrate.",
  "https_jepoynton_com_/https_jepoynton_com_2015_07_08_the-management-of-our-public-services/content_24.html": "Probably the most frequent questions I was asked during the recent campaign concerned the NHS. And it wasn’t just about funding, an issue I addressed in an earlier article. People were concerned about the way it is being managed, its inefficiency, and about the outsourcing of NHS services to the private sector.\nAs it happens, early on in the campaign I attended a seminar addressed by Simon Stevens, the Chief Executive of NHS England, and I asked him for the staff turnover figures for doctors and nurses across the NHS, and for the percentage of staff who were on temporary contracts. He avoided giving me any figures. Whether this was because he did not want to, or because he did not know them I am not sure, so I went on to ask why his board did not include any resource-specialist directors such a Human Resources Director, Finance Director (although there is someone they rather begrudgingly call their chief financial officer), IT Director or Facilities Director. How, I asked, could he be held responsible for the performance of the NHS without such a board. He immediately replied that he could not!\nNow I have no reason to suppose he was just being flippant in giving this reply. I suspect the real reason is that his brief is not one of chief executive that we in the private sector would recognise. Which in turn means that there is no one properly in charge. It is rather like a manufacturing company where the MD has five production directors and a bookkeeper! Clearly it is impossible for such a board to keep tabs on all the resources within the organisation, of which its staff are its most important. No wonder we end up with a health service where the supply of doctors and nurses cannot keep up with demand, where staff turnover has gone through the roof, where a high proportion are expensive agency staff, and where half of those cannot speak English anyway. It came as no surprise therefore when a debate erupted after the election about the shortage of doctors and nurses in the NHS!\nAnother concern frequently expressed was how difficult it is to find anyone in the NHS capable of taking the initiative and making decisions. It would appear that the top-down prescriptive, target-orientated management methodology introduced by Tony Blair’s New Labour government is still in place. The whole thing is upside down. You want your doctors and nurses at the sharp end dealing with the patients and doing the research. They are then in a position to propose the changes and budgets necessary drive their own local units forward in response to the needs of their patients. The role of the board is three-fold: to assess these initiatives, to provide the resources they require, and to monitor the use of all resources across the NHS so as to maximise utilisation and efficiency. That just not appears to be happening at present. I accept that there may also be a need for some central initiatives as well, but not at the expense of the reactive ones.\nAlmost all of our public services are conglomerate in nature; that is they comprise groups of units operating at specialist or local level and accountable through central management to their ultimate owners, Parliament. The most successful method of managing conglomerates is technique perfected by Arnold Weinstock at GEC during the 60s, 70s and 80s which I call comparative management by results. Weinstock famously used just seven key financial indicators (they would of course be different and more diverse in the public sector, but the principle is the same) to compare the performance of all the subsidiaries in the group, and then started kicking arse from the bottom of the list upwards. These numbers aren’t good enough, he would bellow down the line. You are in the bottom half of the list. What are you going to do about it? I want your proposals on my desk by Friday lunchtime” or whatever. If they could improve well and good, but if they could not they were replaced. It was as simple as that.\nCompare this approach to that taken by New Labour, which I call ‘top down prescriptive methodology’. “Tick these boxes. Follow these procedures. Meet these targets. Do it this way and stick your head in the sand while you’re at it”! Weinstock never told his MDs how to do their job; these were expensive, experience people who should already know that; it was what he was paying them for. He was only interested in results. His only other major role was to accumulate and allocate capital funds for investment, and if he could get a better return elsewhere he did so. His ‘cash mountain’ became famous.\nThe difference between the two approaches is striking, but what is also telling is that Weinstock seldom if ever got involved directly with his customers or even with what they were actually buying from GEC. That was all delegated; in other words ‘localised’. Even more so is the role and importance of central management. Weinstock’s head office was tiny. I went there once, just a five story terraced building in Stanhope Gate, but it was only by having a central team that he was able to manage the company in this way.\nIt is also worth noting that New Labour’s approach was to set absolute targets. This may have been politically convenient, but has the drawback that any target will have a resourcing implication, and if that implication is not addressed then the result will be chaos, which of course is precisely what happened. Weinstock’s approach on the other hand was comparative. He knew what was possible by looking at the companies at the top of the list, and simply expected the others to do as well. And when you think about it, this is precisely how an open competitive market works; the choices available to consumers are comparative both in price (efficiency) and quality.\nNow look at what is actually happening out there! We keep hearing of schools and hospitals being ‘put into special measures’, which involves drafting in a whole raft of interim managers, none of whom know anything about the organisation they going in to manage, none of whom will be there in a year’s time or have any permanent commitment to it, and all of whom are being paid massive fees. I saw one case recently where ten such managers had been drafted into a hospital, all of whom were being paid in excess of £100k pa, and the chief honcho at a rate in excess of £500k pa! OMG! What a total and utter waste of time and public money. All you have to do is change the guy in charge and then support him.\nBut if you thought that was bad enough, look at Social Services. They don’t have anyone in charge at all. They are quite literally running around like headless chickens. It’s all very well to say that such services are run by local authorities, but the money comes from central government and when things go wrong we expect ministers to take responsibility. Local authorities are simply not physically in a position to make the comparative assessments required or allocate resources according to demand.\nI suspect the source of the problem lies in the structure of the spending departments themselves. How many of them have a clear structural separation between their advisory side, with its responsibility to advise ministers of current problems and future needs, and their executive side, with its responsibility to deliver a mandate approved by Parliament? Taking it from the top therefore, I would expect to see:-\n– A National Director General / Chief Executive (DG) for each and every public service reporting directly to the relevant Secretary of State and his Permanent Secretary. There could be several within a given department depending on the breadth of that department’s responsibilities.\n– The advisory side of the department organized on a pool basis, such as you would find in a firm of accountants or solicitors, managed through the use of timesheets, project budgets and activity percentages, and run by an Under-Secretary.\n– Each DG having a board of directors covering the full range of functional responsibilities, including HR, Finance, IT, Facilities, internal audit and inspection, and others as may be appropriate, with the Executive side structured on a traditional hierarchical basis.\n– Every level of management under the DG having the power to hire and fire the next level down. This is essential for both authority and accountability.\n– A comprehensive quarterly Management Information System (MIS) covering all key performance and efficiency indicators across the service, including management accounts, enabling comparisons to be made and follow-up action taken where necessary. It is important to emphasise that these indicators are not targets, simply monitoring procedures. It is often said that a good MIS only poses questions; it does not provide answers.\n– Each DG having full and complete autonomy over the allocation of his budget, with no ring-fencing or other restrictions. To the extent that Parliament has decreed certain levels of provision within the service, these should simply be monitored through the MIS.\n– The Board including a non-exec Customer Representative, to whom local governors and customer representatives can report on a functional basis. Each local board would have a similar position, possibly elected locally. Our manifesto commitment for elected county representatives fitted this requirement neatly.",
  "https_jepoynton_com_/https_jepoynton_com_author_jepoynton_page_3/content_63.html": "Delighted to have been reselected to fight the Ealing Southall constituency for UKIP, and have already received warm greetings on many a doorstep. You can download here both my election leaflet and postal election address. The former was really designed in anticipation of the 2018 local elections and was just about to go for printing when the election was announced, so I just added a banner at the top. The latter only gives me a few words to add to a central office designed template, but I hope I have got the essence of the situation across.\nHere though is a much fuller Election Address. In addition there is a shorter hustings address thereafter.\n“I should like to talk about two issues this evening. First there is the absolute Horlicks of a start Theresa May has made to her Brexit negotiations. At this rate she will end up with a bummer of a deal with the EU, claim it is the best thing since sliced bread, and then ram it through Parliament on the back of her temporary blip majority. We could then be stuck with it, which would be an absolute betrayal of all those who voted to LEAVE in the referendum. So what can we do about it, if anything?\nSecond I want to talk about funding so we can end austerity and at the same time resuscitate our public services to the standard we all want and expect. I will show you how UKIP, using our libertarian principles, could raise £150 billion pounds of new money without frightening the horses.\nBut first of all, why am I here at all? Why is UKIP still here? After all we won the referendum so surely that is job done for UKIP and we can now all quietly retire?\nUnfortunately it is much more complicated than that. As I have already mentioned, Brexit in an acceptable form is still far from certain. For us this election is about votes, not seats. Last time we chalked up over 4 million votes and that made an impact. If we can do better this time, which will be a tall order as we are standing down in a number of seats for strategic reasons, putting country before party, we can make an even bigger impact. UKIP is the only pro-Brexit party that can mount a constructive Opposition. The others will of course mount destructive ones, but that is not what we want. So your vote for UKIP will count. A vote for any other candidate in this safe seat will not make a jot of difference. It will be a wasted vote.\nSo what about Theresa May? One of the biggest differences between the Tory version of Brexit and UKIP’s relates to trade. The Tory’s want a trade deal with the EU whereas we have always said we do not. There are three good reasons for this. First, if you plonk a trade deal on top of an existing deficit, you are only going to increase that deficit. That’s just simple mathematics. If imports and exports both rise by roughly the same percentage, which is after all the object of the exercise, then the deficit will rise by the same percentage. What on earth is the point of doing that? It will only increase unemployment.\nSecond, it is critical we eliminate our deficit if we want to avoid a new financial crisis. At present we depend on Quantitative Easing to make good the loss of consumer demand from the deficit. However QE not only undermines our ability to save, it also cannot carry on for much longer. QE works by reducing interest rates, thereby encouraging people to borrow their future earnings to spend today. But inevitably tomorrow will soon become today and, oh dear; we have already spent our income. Not only that, we still have a hole in our economic barrel and we now have to start repaying the money we borrowed yesterday. It just won’t add up. The only way we can avoid Armageddon is to eliminate the deficit, and the only way of doing that is by devaluation and import tariffs, policies which are only available from a no-deal Brexit.\nThird, if we leave without a trade deal then of course we will put in place an import tariff regime of our own; probably a mirror image of the one we are leaving, the EU one. I don’t know why nobody ever talks about this – it’s weird! Maybe it is because I am an accountant that I pick up on it, but if we did that it would be worth an extra £25bn a year to the Treasury. That’s huge. Yet by pursuing a trade deal, egged on by all those free trade fanatics baying in the background, she is proposing to throw that money away for nothing. How crazy is that? Surely no one in their right minds would do that? But no, that is the way she is going. At this rate she is set to drop us all in the biggest pile of poo ever produced by Woman.\nDisastrously Theresa May started her negotiations by declaring openly that she wanted a trade deal. Michel Barnier must have smacked his lips with glee. “She wants something, so let’s make her pay!” he will have said to himself. And so he did, slamming on a €100bn ransom demand. That’s a ludicrous sum of money and he knows it, but probably thought of it as a negotiating anchor to be given back in stages for other goodies along the way. Unfortunately he is instead stuck with it because the other 27 countries have smelt the money and they are not now going to give it up. Barnier is a professional negotiator, whereas Theresa May clearly hasn’t a clue what she is doing. It’s no good being ‘tough and difficult’ if you don’t know what you are doing. That just makes her ‘stubborn and stupid’. We MUST divert her from this course, and that’s why a big vote for UKIP nationally is so important. I am even coming round to the LibDems idea of a second referendum. Not on membership but on the “Deal or No Deal” decision. We have trusted the people once, we can do so again. It may be the only way we can pull the plug on a disastrous deal.\nOK. Let’s move on to funding. If we are to end austerity we have to find £70bn just to do that. Then to rebuild our public services we would need at least another £30bn, making a total of £100bn, or more safely let’s say £80bn, ie a total of £150bn. Is that possible? Well, consider this.\nAs I have just noted, the immediate fiscal benefit of leaving the EU is not just the £10bn saving on budget payments but also the import tariff revenues, giving a total benefit of £35bn. That’s about 2% of GDP. A lot of money and far more than any of the other parties can produce, but unfortunately not as much as the deficit. So what’s next?\nCorporation Tax on multinationals. You may remember that at the Enniskillen G8 Summit a few years ago it was agreed that multinationals should declare their global profits. This would enable us to tax them on those profits so they could not squirrel them away in tax havens. The WTO was supposed to be working on a system whereby they would centrally assess the taxable profit of these multinationals and then apportion them to each nation in proportion to turnover so that those countries could then apply their own tax rates to them. It’s all gone a bit quiet, but if the WTO does deliver this system it could be worth about another £15bn of tax to the UK. Even if they don’t we can still do it unilaterally. There may be a few double tax issues, but we can just direct those to the WTO! So let’s add it on, total £50bn so far.\nNow let’s get philosophical. UKIP is a libertarian party. Freedom of Conscience, Freedom of Expression, Freedom of Choice and Freedom for Britain are the four founding principles upon which the party is built. In this context that means giving people the opportunity to buy their ‘public’ services from the private sector if they want to on a means-tested basis rather than from the public sector. Roughly £400bn is spent on such services, ie health, education, care for the elderly and so on, so if about a quarter of people chose to do this, and on average contributed about a quarter of the cost as their means-tested payments, that would save a further £25bn. So now we are up to £75bn and ahead of the deficit!\nI think it quite likely a significant number of people would do this, depending on the exact means-test gradient which we can alter as need be. After all private sector services are likely to be much more efficient, much more accessible and be provided to a much higher standard. That is because they are in an open competitive market, whereas the public sector is a monopoly and all monopolies profiteer. What is austerity after all but a form of profiteering? People will be prepared to pay for that.\nFurthermore we could end the privilege tag that burdens our independent schools by simply means-testing their fees. That way any parent no matter how poor could consider an independent school education for their child. Our independent schools are among the best in the world, so much so that now around 25% of their pupils come from overseas, which is a huge export earner. But isn’t it a tragedy that more British children cannot benefit from them. Labour’s vindictive, pernicious and envious attacks on them have backfired making them even more privileged than before. It’s time we cherished and championed our independent schools and removed these burdens in return for a means-tested fee regime.\nUKIP also supports grammar schools and free schools, and rightly so if that’s what parents want. Let us never forget that in a free society parents are ultimately responsible for their children, not the state. The state is there to support parents, not to replace them. However we also have a major problem in educating our least able and least focused children. These children need much more attention, smaller class sizes, better trained teachers, more pastoral care etc. etc. which all costs money. We should therefore be aiming to allocate more money per child to these children than to the brighter ones else we will be generating an underclass to the detriment of us all. Streaming allows you to charge means-tested fees for the faster streams and use that money for the slower ones without undermining social mobility.\nWhat’s next? Privatising infrastructure projects, that’s what. HS2, Crossrail, power stations, bridges, tunnels etc are all costing the taxpayer a fortune. Furthermore many of them are probably uneconomic thereby undermining our economic growth rate rather than adding to it. You will never get an objective viability assessment from politicians or civil servants; there are too many hidden agendas in the background, whereas someone who is putting their own money in a competitive bid will surely do so. The long term or monopoly ones can be protected by cap and collar profit regulation to the benefit of both investor and taxpayer. So let’s put these projects up for auction, after the spec has been approved by Parliament, and award them to the higher bidder to build, run and own them. Let the City pay for them if they are viable, and if they are not: don’t do them! It’s a bit finger in the air, but I think we are reasonably safe putting in £25bn a year for this, giving a total now of £100bn.\nResource Management in our public services is next. There isn’t any. I know we all complain about the number of middle managers in the NHS and so on, but there is nothing at the top. For example if you look at the board of NHS England (yes I know it is a separate quango employing about 4000 staff, but it’s the nearest thing the NHS can manage) it is full of medics and civil servants. There is no Human Resources director, no Finance director, no IT director, no Facilities director and so on. In fact there are none of the resource focused directorships that you would see on the board of a private sector conglomerate. No wonder we are not training sufficient doctors and nurses and have to import so many from overseas. No wonder staff turnover rates are so high. What we need is the technique Arnold Weinstock perfected at GEC during the 60s, 70s and 80s. It’s not top-down management. In fact is localism management. I call it ‘Comparative Management by Results’. If we could just get a 5% improvement in efficiency on the £400bn we spend that would be worth another £20bn.\nAnd finally – a Sovereign Wealth Fund. Now I don’t wish to speak ill of the politically dead, but surely George Osborne must count as one of the deadest of dead sheep ever to have inhabited the Treasury (if that isn’t a contradiction in terms!). I always got the impression he wasn’t even interested in his subject. I know Gordon Brown was a disaster, but at least he tried and came up with initiatives. Whereas as Osborne missed an absolute sitter right under his nose; using the fact that interest rates were on the floor to set up a Sovereign Wealth Fund to hedge our National Debt and un-funded pension liabilities, as well as in the long term to fund our public services out of investment income rather than taxes. Work though the figures and you will see it is money for old rope! Furthermore we can to some extent discount the future revenue stream to fund a current ongoing deficit. I am going to put in £30bn for that, and there’s my £150bn! I rest my case. Thank you very much.”\nAnd now for the hustings address:\n“Good evening L&G, and first may I say how pleased I am to be here at last. In 2015 I had to miss this hustings due to a prior engagement, so I hope you didn’t think I was avoiding you! Far from it, because may I also say how much I have enjoyed canvassing around Southall. You have been friendly, open-minded, curious, receptive and engaging, and that surely is all we candidates can ask of you. So thank you also for that.\nNow I don’t want to spend the whole evening banging on about Brexit, but if you are interested in the technical arguments, about trade in particular, you can find them in my full Election Address, which is on our branch website at ukipealing.com. It is also on the Democracy Club website and on my own website at jepoynton.com.\nI thought however it would be interesting just to reflect for a moment on the sudden fall in the expected Tory majority, and why that has happened. Some say it is because of Theresa May’s U-turns on social care and winter fuel payments, but I doubt it. They only affected the rich, and Labour are all in favour of taxing the rich, so where’s the difference?\nNo, I think it is because the British public have sensed she has already made a complete car-crash of these Brexit negotiations. By demanding a trade deal with the EU, up front, she has played straight into Michel Barnier’s hands. He has responded by demanding an enormous ransom of €100 billion – an impossible sum. She didn’t have to do that, and is now trying to wriggle out of it by saying that no deal is better than a bad deal. But we could have had a deal on non-trade issues anyway, because the EU wanted to deal with those first, and that would have suited us just fine because we could then simply have left at half-time. Now not even that option is available.\nThe odd thing though is that people have rushed to the opposite extreme, like lemmings over a cliff, straight into the lap of Labour. Do people really think Jeremy Corbyn could do better? Honestly, this is a man who cannot even add up, let alone negotiate. It would be a case of out the frying pan and into the fire. UKIP invented Brexit, we fought for it, we secured the referendum, we understand it. It’s our baby. So please, I beg of you, for everyone’s sake, let us deliver it.\nBut enough of Brexit already! What I really want to concentrate on this evening is “Beyond Brexit”. UKIP is a Libertarian party. Indeed so far as I can see it is the only libertarian party on the British political stage. The two main parties, Tories and Labour, are partisan and confrontational; still busily fighting the class wars of the early twentieth century, like a couple of Don Quixote’s tilting at windmills.\nSo what exactly do I mean by Libertarian? I could talk about Freedom of Conscience. I could talk about Freedom of Expression, or Freedom of Choice, and of course of Freedom for Britain. But as is so often the case the best definition comes from considering the opposite, and for that I can do no better than John Stuart Mill’s famous dictum about the Tyranny of the Majority. That simply means that in a democratic society it is not acceptable for the majority to decide everything, because that leaves no room for minority rights or individual responsibility – for true diversity if you like.\nWe had a classic example of the Tyranny of the Majority a few years ago when a Labour government closed down Catholic adoption agencies. They were doing a great job and harming no one, but because they were serving only the Catholic community they had to go. They simply did not fit with Labour’s socialist totalitarian straight-jacket ideology. Here in Southall you have a number of Free Schools. They likewise would not survive a Labour Government. Labour hates diversity and freedom of choice. All schools have to be comprehensive schools, so Grammar Schools, Free Schools and Independent schools are all in their firing line. To us, parents are ultimately responsible for their children, not the State. The State is there to support parents, not to replace them.\nThey talk about abolishing privilege, and I get that. But you know there is a much simpler way of doing it. Simply means-test independent school fees. That way any parent, no matter how poor, could consider an independent or grammar school education for their child and at the same time the cost to the Treasury is reduced so more can be spent on the slower stream schools, which is where it is really needed. Our independent schools are amongst the best in the world. 25% of their pupils now come from overseas. And UKIP’s immigration policies would not affect that at all. We are not concerned about temporary comings and goings. It is permanent settlement and citizenship which is the problem. But what a tragedy that more British children cannot now attend these schools. Labour’s vindictive, pernicious, jealous and small-minded policies have actually increased the privilege rather than reduce it! And now they want to add VAT as well.\nBut let me broaden the picture. Why shouldn’t all our non-security public services be available from the private sector on a means-tested basis? That would be real freedom of choice. It would not only ensure that the supply of services, such as care for the elderly, kept up with demand in an efficient manner, it would also reduce the pressure on our existing publicly owned services, thereby enabling them to do a better job. It is after all the purchase decision in an open competitive market that drives efficiency and drives quality of service, and that is why I believe a significant proportion of the population would chose the private sector even thought they would have to pay something affordable for it. That could save the state some £25bn a year whilst at the same time improving services. People talk about the private sector profiteering, but it is monopolies that profiteer, whoever owns them. After all, what is austerity if not profiteering? The public sector is by far the worst offender.\nIn summary I am asking you to vote UKIP at this election not only to rescue Brexit but also to share with me my vision for a truly libertarian future for our country. For us this election about votes, not seats. Last time we polled over 4 million votes. That had an impact. If we can repeat that or improve on it this time it will again have an impact. So a vote for UKIP will count and be significant.”",
  "https_jepoynton_com_/https_jepoynton_com_2017_05_16_general-election-2017/content_52.html": "Delighted to have been reselected to fight the Ealing Southall constituency for UKIP, and have already received warm greetings on many a doorstep. You can download here both my election leaflet and postal election address. The former was really designed in anticipation of the 2018 local elections and was just about to go for printing when the election was announced, so I just added a banner at the top. The latter only gives me a few words to add to a central office designed template, but I hope I have got the essence of the situation across.\nHere though is a much fuller Election Address. In addition there is a shorter hustings address thereafter.\n“I should like to talk about two issues this evening. First there is the absolute Horlicks of a start Theresa May has made to her Brexit negotiations. At this rate she will end up with a bummer of a deal with the EU, claim it is the best thing since sliced bread, and then ram it through Parliament on the back of her temporary blip majority. We could then be stuck with it, which would be an absolute betrayal of all those who voted to LEAVE in the referendum. So what can we do about it, if anything?\nSecond I want to talk about funding so we can end austerity and at the same time resuscitate our public services to the standard we all want and expect. I will show you how UKIP, using our libertarian principles, could raise £150 billion pounds of new money without frightening the horses.\nBut first of all, why am I here at all? Why is UKIP still here? After all we won the referendum so surely that is job done for UKIP and we can now all quietly retire?\nUnfortunately it is much more complicated than that. As I have already mentioned, Brexit in an acceptable form is still far from certain. For us this election is about votes, not seats. Last time we chalked up over 4 million votes and that made an impact. If we can do better this time, which will be a tall order as we are standing down in a number of seats for strategic reasons, putting country before party, we can make an even bigger impact. UKIP is the only pro-Brexit party that can mount a constructive Opposition. The others will of course mount destructive ones, but that is not what we want. So your vote for UKIP will count. A vote for any other candidate in this safe seat will not make a jot of difference. It will be a wasted vote.\nSo what about Theresa May? One of the biggest differences between the Tory version of Brexit and UKIP’s relates to trade. The Tory’s want a trade deal with the EU whereas we have always said we do not. There are three good reasons for this. First, if you plonk a trade deal on top of an existing deficit, you are only going to increase that deficit. That’s just simple mathematics. If imports and exports both rise by roughly the same percentage, which is after all the object of the exercise, then the deficit will rise by the same percentage. What on earth is the point of doing that? It will only increase unemployment.\nSecond, it is critical we eliminate our deficit if we want to avoid a new financial crisis. At present we depend on Quantitative Easing to make good the loss of consumer demand from the deficit. However QE not only undermines our ability to save, it also cannot carry on for much longer. QE works by reducing interest rates, thereby encouraging people to borrow their future earnings to spend today. But inevitably tomorrow will soon become today and, oh dear; we have already spent our income. Not only that, we still have a hole in our economic barrel and we now have to start repaying the money we borrowed yesterday. It just won’t add up. The only way we can avoid Armageddon is to eliminate the deficit, and the only way of doing that is by devaluation and import tariffs, policies which are only available from a no-deal Brexit.\nThird, if we leave without a trade deal then of course we will put in place an import tariff regime of our own; probably a mirror image of the one we are leaving, the EU one. I don’t know why nobody ever talks about this – it’s weird! Maybe it is because I am an accountant that I pick up on it, but if we did that it would be worth an extra £25bn a year to the Treasury. That’s huge. Yet by pursuing a trade deal, egged on by all those free trade fanatics baying in the background, she is proposing to throw that money away for nothing. How crazy is that? Surely no one in their right minds would do that? But no, that is the way she is going. At this rate she is set to drop us all in the biggest pile of poo ever produced by Woman.\nDisastrously Theresa May started her negotiations by declaring openly that she wanted a trade deal. Michel Barnier must have smacked his lips with glee. “She wants something, so let’s make her pay!” he will have said to himself. And so he did, slamming on a €100bn ransom demand. That’s a ludicrous sum of money and he knows it, but probably thought of it as a negotiating anchor to be given back in stages for other goodies along the way. Unfortunately he is instead stuck with it because the other 27 countries have smelt the money and they are not now going to give it up. Barnier is a professional negotiator, whereas Theresa May clearly hasn’t a clue what she is doing. It’s no good being ‘tough and difficult’ if you don’t know what you are doing. That just makes her ‘stubborn and stupid’. We MUST divert her from this course, and that’s why a big vote for UKIP nationally is so important. I am even coming round to the LibDems idea of a second referendum. Not on membership but on the “Deal or No Deal” decision. We have trusted the people once, we can do so again. It may be the only way we can pull the plug on a disastrous deal.\nOK. Let’s move on to funding. If we are to end austerity we have to find £70bn just to do that. Then to rebuild our public services we would need at least another £30bn, making a total of £100bn, or more safely let’s say £80bn, ie a total of £150bn. Is that possible? Well, consider this.\nAs I have just noted, the immediate fiscal benefit of leaving the EU is not just the £10bn saving on budget payments but also the import tariff revenues, giving a total benefit of £35bn. That’s about 2% of GDP. A lot of money and far more than any of the other parties can produce, but unfortunately not as much as the deficit. So what’s next?\nCorporation Tax on multinationals. You may remember that at the Enniskillen G8 Summit a few years ago it was agreed that multinationals should declare their global profits. This would enable us to tax them on those profits so they could not squirrel them away in tax havens. The WTO was supposed to be working on a system whereby they would centrally assess the taxable profit of these multinationals and then apportion them to each nation in proportion to turnover so that those countries could then apply their own tax rates to them. It’s all gone a bit quiet, but if the WTO does deliver this system it could be worth about another £15bn of tax to the UK. Even if they don’t we can still do it unilaterally. There may be a few double tax issues, but we can just direct those to the WTO! So let’s add it on, total £50bn so far.\nNow let’s get philosophical. UKIP is a libertarian party. Freedom of Conscience, Freedom of Expression, Freedom of Choice and Freedom for Britain are the four founding principles upon which the party is built. In this context that means giving people the opportunity to buy their ‘public’ services from the private sector if they want to on a means-tested basis rather than from the public sector. Roughly £400bn is spent on such services, ie health, education, care for the elderly and so on, so if about a quarter of people chose to do this, and on average contributed about a quarter of the cost as their means-tested payments, that would save a further £25bn. So now we are up to £75bn and ahead of the deficit!\nI think it quite likely a significant number of people would do this, depending on the exact means-test gradient which we can alter as need be. After all private sector services are likely to be much more efficient, much more accessible and be provided to a much higher standard. That is because they are in an open competitive market, whereas the public sector is a monopoly and all monopolies profiteer. What is austerity after all but a form of profiteering? People will be prepared to pay for that.\nFurthermore we could end the privilege tag that burdens our independent schools by simply means-testing their fees. That way any parent no matter how poor could consider an independent school education for their child. Our independent schools are among the best in the world, so much so that now around 25% of their pupils come from overseas, which is a huge export earner. But isn’t it a tragedy that more British children cannot benefit from them. Labour’s vindictive, pernicious and envious attacks on them have backfired making them even more privileged than before. It’s time we cherished and championed our independent schools and removed these burdens in return for a means-tested fee regime.\nUKIP also supports grammar schools and free schools, and rightly so if that’s what parents want. Let us never forget that in a free society parents are ultimately responsible for their children, not the state. The state is there to support parents, not to replace them. However we also have a major problem in educating our least able and least focused children. These children need much more attention, smaller class sizes, better trained teachers, more pastoral care etc. etc. which all costs money. We should therefore be aiming to allocate more money per child to these children than to the brighter ones else we will be generating an underclass to the detriment of us all. Streaming allows you to charge means-tested fees for the faster streams and use that money for the slower ones without undermining social mobility.\nWhat’s next? Privatising infrastructure projects, that’s what. HS2, Crossrail, power stations, bridges, tunnels etc are all costing the taxpayer a fortune. Furthermore many of them are probably uneconomic thereby undermining our economic growth rate rather than adding to it. You will never get an objective viability assessment from politicians or civil servants; there are too many hidden agendas in the background, whereas someone who is putting their own money in a competitive bid will surely do so. The long term or monopoly ones can be protected by cap and collar profit regulation to the benefit of both investor and taxpayer. So let’s put these projects up for auction, after the spec has been approved by Parliament, and award them to the higher bidder to build, run and own them. Let the City pay for them if they are viable, and if they are not: don’t do them! It’s a bit finger in the air, but I think we are reasonably safe putting in £25bn a year for this, giving a total now of £100bn.\nResource Management in our public services is next. There isn’t any. I know we all complain about the number of middle managers in the NHS and so on, but there is nothing at the top. For example if you look at the board of NHS England (yes I know it is a separate quango employing about 4000 staff, but it’s the nearest thing the NHS can manage) it is full of medics and civil servants. There is no Human Resources director, no Finance director, no IT director, no Facilities director and so on. In fact there are none of the resource focused directorships that you would see on the board of a private sector conglomerate. No wonder we are not training sufficient doctors and nurses and have to import so many from overseas. No wonder staff turnover rates are so high. What we need is the technique Arnold Weinstock perfected at GEC during the 60s, 70s and 80s. It’s not top-down management. In fact is localism management. I call it ‘Comparative Management by Results’. If we could just get a 5% improvement in efficiency on the £400bn we spend that would be worth another £20bn.\nAnd finally – a Sovereign Wealth Fund. Now I don’t wish to speak ill of the politically dead, but surely George Osborne must count as one of the deadest of dead sheep ever to have inhabited the Treasury (if that isn’t a contradiction in terms!). I always got the impression he wasn’t even interested in his subject. I know Gordon Brown was a disaster, but at least he tried and came up with initiatives. Whereas as Osborne missed an absolute sitter right under his nose; using the fact that interest rates were on the floor to set up a Sovereign Wealth Fund to hedge our National Debt and un-funded pension liabilities, as well as in the long term to fund our public services out of investment income rather than taxes. Work though the figures and you will see it is money for old rope! Furthermore we can to some extent discount the future revenue stream to fund a current ongoing deficit. I am going to put in £30bn for that, and there’s my £150bn! I rest my case. Thank you very much.”\nAnd now for the hustings address:\n“Good evening L&G, and first may I say how pleased I am to be here at last.

  "https_jepoynton_com_/https_jepoynton_com_page_4/content_56.html": "The almost universally held and unquestioned belief in free trade, that is trade unhindered by either blockade or tariffs, is generally attributed to the classical economist David Ricardo, who included a chapter on Foreign Trade in his famous book The Principles of Political Economy and Taxation published in 1817. The modern mantra holds that free trade drives investment, productivity and economic growth through increased competition from imports.\nAllowing for the fact that Ricardo was writing before modern terms such as ‘value added’, ‘productivity’, ‘money supply’ or ‘GDP’ were introduced, he in fact makes no mention of this effect at all! His only mention of productivity comes when he is examining the effect on the economies of two countries engaged in balanced trade when one finds a more efficient method of production. The result is a trade surplus by that country resulting in an increased money supply, which in turn creates inflation, which in turn rebalances the trade by attracting more imports. In his argument the productivity increase is the cause of increased competition, not the result of it. He also notes the benefits of specialisation, where different countries have different natural advantages in the production of certain goods, but makes no suggestion that these advantages are anything other than fixed. That is all.\nRicardo wrote at a time when most money was fixed in the form of precious metals and thus before the advent of floating exchange rates and mega currency capital flows. His arguments preclude the possibility of the sort of structural trade imbalances we see today.\nOf course there are numerous papers to be found on the internet and elsewhere arguing that free trade enhances economic growth. Invariably the writer will point to periods of economic growth, such as the post-war decades or the decade following the exit from the ERM, and notes the coincidence with an expansion in free trade. Closer inspection however reveals plenty of alternative possible causes, such as peace, reconstruction, stability and devaluation. So the logic is by no means conclusive.\nI am well aware also of the classical arguments around specialisation and economies of scale. However these have now been superseded by globalisation and the advent of off-shoring. Richard Baldwin, author of “The Great Convergence: Information Technology and the New Globalisation”, gives the example of the Canadian company Bombardier that transferred the production of aircraft tails from Quebec to Mexico. He says “The ICT revolution made it feasible for rich-nation firms to leverage their knowledge with low-wage workers abroad. Bombardier can now use its know-how to make aircraft tails with Mexican manufacturing engineers who only get $60 a day instead of Canadian engineers on $35 an hour. The ability of, for example, Canadian firms to take their knowledge elsewhere means that what is good for Bombardier may not be good for Canada.” He could have added that these multinational companies also off-shore their profits, so their host nations no longer even get a share of those profits though tax.\nA related perspective comes from Mariana Mazzucato, author of “The Entrepreneurial State”, who gives a detailed account of how almost all the significant technological breakthroughs of the last seventy years, including the internet, Microsoft’s Windows, Apple’s smart-phones and Google’s search algorithm to name but a few, have their genesis in state-funded research. The private sector only became involved when the uncertainties were considerably reduced, and venture capitalists when the product was almost ready to bring to market. They then made billions for themselves from IPO’s and share buy-backs, all off-shored or reduced by favourable capital gains tax regimes negotiated on the bogus claim that they are taking the enormous risks necessary to promote innovation. The result has been that none of those profits were either returned to the state or reinvested in new research.\nWhat we are seeing now is not so much the creation of new wealth but a massive transfer of existing wealth to third world countries as a result of globalisation and unbalanced free trade. Of course it is wonderful that we can now anticipate the ending of global food poverty by 2030, but let us not kid ourselves that most of this is not at the expense of the first-world working classes. The “I’m all right, Jack” Remainian middle-class establishment has of course protected itself with a widening pay gap, leaving the burden to be carried just by the lower income groups, and they are now fed up with both the burden and the injustice of it.\nNow it is not my purpose to offer conclusive evidence or the results of research but, like the established view, rely on logic and what stands to reason. The disadvantage is that logic alone does not give any measure of the factors examined. For example, it would be logical to suppose that the law of diminishing returns applies to the competitive benefits of each 1% marginal increase in imports. With UK imports running at close on 35% of GDP it would be reasonable to assume that any competitive effect comes from the established 35% rather than from any marginal increase. It might also be reasonable to conclude that the effects of specialisation are also much diminished anyway given that most countries are now industrialising and that even England can produce wine! Any given new free trade agreement is likely to have only a one-off step benefit rather than provide the ongoing growth such as we get from innovation.\nSo my purpose rather is to examine whether such benefits are greater or less than the damage caused by structural trade deficits, and consequently our policy towards the use of import tariffs. This issue is of critical importance at present for three reasons:\n(1) it affects our approach to negotiating our disengagement from the EU, and\n(2) it affects how we tackle the outstanding imbalances which still threaten world economic and banking stability.\n(3) it highlights the damage that free-trade fanaticism can cause.\nBrexit has given us the benefit of a 10% devaluation, which should go some way toward reducing our record trade deficit, now in excess of 5% of GDP. But devaluation will almost certainly not do the whole job. The danger is that Mrs. May’s government will not now impose the maximum trade tariffs on the EU’s exports to us. We will still have to pay around 4.3% on average in tariffs on our exports to them, which we can easily afford following the devaluation, so a balanced position maintaining the status quo demands we should charge the same to them. Failure to do so will not only worsen our deficit, it will also throw away some £25bn of potential import tariff revenues; money we desperately need to plug our fiscal deficit.\nEven suppose some free trade deal were to be agreed with the EU prior to the completion of the Article 50 transition period, and even suppose this were balanced in each sides’ interests, the result would be higher imports and exports but no reduction in the deficit and the loss of the tariff revenues. Indeed the deficit would increase in proportion. As we start with a deficit, any FTA will only make it worse – the very opposite of what we want. And of course in the short term any increase in imports destroys jobs just as rapidly as exports create them, so we would have thrown away the import tariff revenues for nothing.\nThe only way we could get any advantage out of an agreement with the EU would be if it were unbalanced in our favour. That’s most unlikely to happen, particularly in view of the EU’s desire to maintain free movement of peoples. In other words they want to skew it in their favour! Forget it, we will be better off without- the WTO option is the best option. And of course there is no prospect of any sort of new Napoleonic blockade. That would be illegal under WTO rules. All we are talking about here is tariffs. Interesting how the Remain camp use the term ‘access’ to the single market to imply a blockade! Much the same applies to the term ‘free movement of people’. The vast majority will be able to come and go with just a visa, probably obtainable online! The problem only arises if they overstay that visa, and with online identification of over-stayers that should be manageable too. The important line must be drawn at citizenship and permanent leave to remain.\nAt present the rest of the world pays these tariffs to Brussels, but after Brexit the danger is they would receive the benefit of a reduction in tariffs they pay with no counterbalancing advantage to the UK. That would be a disaster. If we charge the same tariffs and then simply divert them from Brussels to London the rest of the world will not notice any difference and we will gain the revenues. There is no sign that Mrs. May’s government understands this.\nBut this debate must considered in the light of the importance of eliminating our trade deficit; something we have given almost no priority to in the past. Lord King (previously Mervyn King, Governor of the Bank of England from 2003 to 2013) has just published a fascinating and very readable book entitled “The End of Alchemy“, in which he not only proposes a new approach to bank regulation but also traces the cause of both the banking crisis and our deterioration standards of living back to the massive global trade imbalances that developed after the fall of the Berlin Wall. He makes it very clear that we must take trade deficits far more seriously than we have done in the past. Here is an extract:\n“Since the early 1990’s, long-term interest rates have fallen sharply, and this has had enormous implications for all our economies. Countries such as the United States, United Kingdom and some others in Europe were faced with what were in effect structural trade deficits. Those deficits – an excess of imports over exports – amounted to a continuing drag on demand. So in order to ensure that total demand – domestic demand minus the trade deficit – matched the capacity of their economies to produce, central banks in the deficit countries cut their official interest rates in order to boost domestic demand. That created an imbalance within those countries with spending too high relative to current and prospective incomes. In countries with trade surpluses such as China and Germany, spending was too low relative to likely future incomes [so they did the same – Ed.]. And the imbalance between countries – large trade surpluses and deficits – continued.\nAll this reinforced the determination of central banks to maintain extraordinarily low interest rates. Monetary stimulus via low interest rates works largely by giving incentives to bring forward spending from the future to the present. But this is a short-term effect. After a time tomorrow becomes today. Then we have to repeat the exercise and bring forward spending from the new tomorrow to the new today. As time passes we will be digging larger and larger holes in future demand. The result is a self-reinforcing path of weak growth in the economy. What started as an intentional savings glut has become a major disequilibrium in the world economy. This creates an enormous challenge for monetary policy. Central banks are, in effect, like cyclists pedalling up an ever steeper hill. They have to inject more and more monetary stimulus in order to maintain the same rate of growth of aggregate spending.\nBefore the crisis, many thought that the Great Stability could continue indefinitely and failed to understand that it could not. Their credulity was understandable. After all, GDP as a whole was evolving on a steady path, with growth around historical average rates, and low and stable inflation. But the imbalance in the pattern of spending and saving was far from sustainable, and was leading to the build-up of large stocks of debts. Bad investments were made, encouraged by low real interest rates. The crisis revealed that much of that misplaced investment – residential housing in the United States, Ireland and Spain; commercial property in Britain- was unprofitable, producing losses for borrowers and lenders alike. The impact of the crisis was to make debtors and creditors – households, companies and governments – uncomfortably aware that their previous spending paths had been based on unrealistic assessments of future long-term incomes. So they reduced spending. And central banks then had to cut interest rates yet again to bring more spending forward from the future to the present, and to create more money by purchasing large quantities of assets from the private sector – the practice known as unconventional monetary policy or quantitative easing (QE). There is in fact nothing unconventional about such a practice – so-called QE was long regarded as a standard tool of monetary policy – but the scale on which it has been implemented is unprecedented. Even so, it has become more and more difficult to persuade households and businesses to bring forward once again from an even bleaker future. After a point, monetary policy confronts diminishing returns. We have reached that point.”\nIn other words the imbalances have not gone away. He could have added that we will see a massive increase in unemployment if we cannot eliminate the trade deficit, and that Brexit provides the only opportunity to do so. Indeed we are not just talking about trade imbalances but also about fiscal deficits and unrepayable national debts, as well as the low interest rate, low growth scenario itself. An increase in interest rates would encourage savings which would flow into investments and new technology, thereby increasing productivity and economic growth, but this won’t happen until the imbalances are eradicated. It’s not that the new technology is not there; just that it is not being used. In addition there are also severe imbalances in some particular markets within the UK, such as housing, steel and executive salaries, which also pose a threat to future growth and stability.\nAfter reading such an interesting account of the problems we face, including Lord King’s ideas on the future of bank regulation – an approach he calls the “Pawnbroker for All Seasons”, being a continuous replacement for the crisis-driven “Lender of Last Resort” policy first described by Walter Bagehot – I have to say I came down with a bump during his last chapter, entitled “The Audacity of Pessimism”. It is here he gives his prescription for dealing with these outstanding economic challenges. He has three recommendations, and I add my comments against each one as follows:-\n(1) To enhance productivity in all ways possible. Comment: All in favour of course, but surely all countries around the world will be doing exactly the same thing, so the chances of the UK or other deficit countries stealing a permanent structural march on all the others seem most unlikely to me.\n(2) To extend free trade wherever possible, including TTIP. Comment: See above – surely a series of balanced trade deals will leave the opening imbalances unchanged or even magnified. This after all is why the Doha round collapsed.\n(3) Return to freely floating exchange rates. Comment: I assume he is referring to an end to the eurozone here. And the best of luck with that one M’Lud! Can’t see it happening myself, and anyway it is not within our gift, though I appreciate he is stressing the need for action at international level to avoid what he calls the prisoner’s dilemma.\nSo what is my prescription then? I offer the following ten recommendations, many of which the UK can pursue unilaterally:-\n(1) To set up a UK Sovereign Wealth Fund while interest rates are still on the floor to hedge our national debt, future unfunded pension liabilities and urgent infrastructure improvements. Regular readers will know I have recommended this idea on numerous occasions, for example under my post on Pensions, but the particular relevance here is that\n(a) The investment of a large part of this fund overseas will make the pound more competitive,\n(b) The building up of the fund will increase the national savings rate, and hence investment and economic growth,\n(c) The knowledge that the debt is ultimately covered means we can take a much more flexible and cyclical approach to the fiscal deficit today, concentrating on recovery now and leaving austerity until the recovery has accelerated too far.\n(2) To take advantage of Brexit to set up maximum import tariffs for the UK to minimise our own trade deficit thereby enabling us the start raising interest rates and economic growth, and to help finance our fiscal deficit (again, see above).\n(3) To pursue internationally a global import tariff regime designed to counter global trade imbalances (see my earlier post on Greece, the Eurozone and World Trade). The maximum tariff rates would be set for each country by the WTO in relation both to the size of their trade deficits and to the size of any defaulted sovereign foreign currency debt (see next). Also encourage a global corporation tax regime whereby tax is levied on global profits apportioned to national/global turnover. Only the profits would be reallocated centrally, leaving each country to apply it’s own rate of tax. Start in the UK anyway!\n(4) To allow internationally insolvent countries to carry forward their defaulted debt on an interest-free basis. To haircut capital balances on the other hand would surely lead to contagion across the whole banking system. Such debts would have priory for repayment if and when the country returned to trade surplus.\n(5) Rigorously control our borders so that businesses can no longer take the easy way out by importing cheap staff instead of training up our school leavers or investing in new technology. It will also end wage compression which was such a significant factor in the vote to leave the EU. Our objective must be balanced migration and well as balanced trade. Both are only available through Brexit. Richard Baldwin (see above) opines that controlling our borders will not stop firms from off-shoring, and that is probably true. But unless we do so we cannot stimulate demand and reduce unemployment through traditional Keynesian fiscal and monetary policies, as instead they will only suck in more immigrants. This is indeed is very apparent from current statistics; the indigenous unemployed are not benefiting. Keynes tells us that a balanced economy will create exactly the right number of jobs to meet the requirements of new entrants to the labour market. The fact that we are apparently now dependent on immigration is simply a reflection of these imbalances, including skills and regional imbalances, and over-stimulation of the economy as a result of political pressures.\n(6) Set up a portfolio of Local Community Banks across the UK, either in the ownership of the Bank of England or allow independently, along the lines of the “Bank of Dave” in Bolton and those in Germany, to engage purely in taking in local medium to long-term deposits and lending to local businesses. It seems to me such banks could easily meet Lord King’s “Pawnbroker for All Seasons” test whereby effective liquid assets must always exceed effective liquid liabilities, and the effect, particularly in areas of higher unemployment, would help to reduce the regional disparities which were also a significant factor in the vote the leave the EU.\n(7) Complete welfare reform along the lines set out in my earlier post here in order really to make work pay. The previous government introduced all sorts of sticks but no carrots. We need both, including a big increase in the UC earnings disregards in place of the duplicate tax credits system. Also introduce a separate self-assessed benefit for the self-employed which would only be continued on receipt of a monthly return of hours worked and income. Over-claims would attract a high rate of interest. This will give us a better indication of underemployment in this growing sector of the labour market and therefore a better indication of where we are in the economic cycle.\n(8) Quarantine those UK markets which are themselves in disequilibrium, ie\n(a) The housing market. Introduce macro prudential measures to limit the availability of mortgage finance so as to hold house prices level, or even slightly declining, post-code by post-code across the country. As well as creating stability this would\n(i) provide an additional string to the bow of regional policy,\n(ii) remove the expectation of property gains whereby the rich get richer by doing nothing,\n(iii) reduce the danger of repossessions,\n(iv) encourage property developers to build on and sell their land banks.\n(b) The steel industry. Set tariff levels so that imports are no greater than the excess of domestic demand over 90% of domestic supply. Promote competition within the UK steel industry but limit profits with a cap, and restrict pay increases to those necessary to prevent a rise in staff turnover rates.\n(c) Executive and professional employee pay. Introduce Cheapest Competent Candidate procedures, starting with the public sector and then by inclusion into company law. Also consider the introduction of Supervisory Boards for all public companies, comprising perhaps the six largest shareholders, three executives and the chairman, to ensure a shareholder veto over this and other strategic decisions. See this earlier post.\n(9) Regional policy. Introduce a second personal allowance into the income tax system so that those living in areas of higher unemployment pay less tax on any given income that those living in areas of low unemployment. Adjust as you go along to achieve an even and stable level of percentage employment across the country. See this earlier post.\n(10) Introduce a National Credit Card so that all citizens can choose between the public and private sectors for their ‘public’ services, both effectively free at the point of delivery, but with the latter on a means test applied after the event via the tax system. This can be introduced gradually by varying the means test gradient as supply rises to meet demand in the private sector, and will consequently both reduce the burden on the taxpayer and improve the efficiency and quality of the services provided in both sectors though competition. Working capital at 5% can be provided by the Sovereign Wealth Fund. See this earlier post.\nIn many respects a successful hard Brexit is very like victory at El Alamein, of which Churchill famously said “This is not the end of the war. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it may just be the end of the beginning”. Brexit merely provides the opportunity to avoid Armageddon. There will follow several years of hard graft before we can secure balanced trade and migration, during which we shall have to hold back on growth to prevent inflation. Let us never forget that the establishment almost entirely backed Halifax for Prime Minister in 1940. The Remainians won’t go quietly, but we shall fight them at the polls, we shall fight them in the press and in the media. We shall never give up!",
  "https_jepoynton_com_/https_jepoynton_com_2015_09_23_pensions/content_69.html": "In this post I argue the case for the following changes to the state and public sector pension schemes, as I believe the recommendations from Lord Hutton’s report in 2011 fell far short of what is both required and possible.\n1). Funding the state and public sector pension schemes, thereby saving in excess of £20bn a year in employer (taxpayer) contributions, and hedging future demographic risks,\n2). Removing employers from public sector pension schemes altogether thereby creating a purely bilateral relationship between members and administrators. This can be achieved simply by adding employers’ contributions to salary and treating them subsequently as employees’ contributions. This would then :-\na). enable members to tailor their schemes to their individual requirements. They would be able to set two of the three parameters – contribution level, retirement age and pension level – and obtain a quote for the third,\nb). amalgamate all of the many thousands of public sector schemes into one, thereby saving millions on administration costs as well as addressing Hutton’s concerns over local accountability and scheme variation. Hutton actually doubled the number of schemes required, each with its own board of trustees and administrators,\nc). allow members to move between the public and private sectors without suffering a break in their pension arrangements,\nd). enable the defined-benefit arrangement to be retained by presuming an underlying growth rate of 4% (Piketty’s 5% unmanaged average – see below – less 1% risk premium). The taxpayer would still bear the risk of any shortfall, but would benefit from fund growth in excess of 4% (more likely). It is the 4% fund growth allocated to the scheme that enables the contribution rates to be reduced. However during the transition from the pay-as-you-go to the funded basis the cash-flow shortfall would be made up from additional government borrowing as for the Sovereign Wealth Fund. Borrow twice what is required for cash flow and the extra will grow sufficiently over 30 years to pay off the full amount on redemption plus interest. If funds are not available at 3% or less the transition is simply extended until they are once more.\n3). If necessary introduce clawback to state pensions to balance the books. This is in any case in line with the insurance principle indicated by the name NIC’s. These measures give the lie to those Ponzi-scheme artists who propose ever greater immigration to fund future pensions.\n4). Limiting the amount of cash lump sum withdrawals from any pension, public or private, so that the member could not end up back on benefits later on.\nFunding\nIt is around this time of year that my pension schemes send me their annual statements showing whether my funds have grown or not. I have a couple of defined contribution (money-purchase) schemes, and it is twenty years now since I stopped paying into them. They are both now invested fully in global managed funds of one sort or another, though in the early years there were some fixed interest and with-profits funds as well. Each year I calculate the net growth after charges and before income draw-down. So this year I thought I would calculate also the average net growth over twenty years. You can do this in two ways. You can either calculate the annual rates first or then average them, which give you a compounded rate, or you can take the growth on the opening value and divide by twenty, which gives you the simple rate. On the first basis the results are 6.2% and 7.4%, and on the second 10.4% and 13.2%. I also looked up the performance of one of the leading investment trusts, the Alliance Trust, and found a corresponding growth in share price of 5.4% and 7.4% respectively. That of course is ex-dividend, so you can add another two or three percent to get the full return.\nThese all compare favourably with Thomas Piketty’s 5% long term compounded rate of return on capital. Clearly his is an unmanaged average. Any half-competent fund manager should be able to beat it. I mention this also in the light of my previous recommendation to hedge the National Debt with a Sovereign Wealth Fund.\nWhen I read Lord Hutton’s report on the reform of public sector pensions four years ago I scoured it for his conclusions about funding. In fact there is only one short sentence in the entire report about it in which he states that the “benefits of funding are not clear”. I have to say I suffered something of a Victor Meldrew moment when I read that! Not clear? Try going to Specsavers, m’lord! And then the penny dropped. To anyone with experience of corresponding with HM Treasury and its Ministers, this phrase “the benefits are not clear” is standard mandarin-speak for “over our dead bodies”. What is clear is that poor old Lord Hutton had been squished by the Treasury long before he had even sat down to write his report! I can quite see that he would want to continue on a defined-benefit basis, but that doesn’t rule out funding. I can also see that there would have to be some form of interim funding to cover the cash-flow switch from using contributions to pay current pensions in payment to investing them, but with 30-years bonds currently only costing 3% pa the same conclusion applies.\nHutton provides tables which show the level of contributions typically paid into public sector schemes. There are in fact thousands of them, one for each employer, including local authorities, and a few of them are funded or semi-funded. Some, where early retirement is normal, such as the Fire and Armed Services have combined contribution levels over 30%, but most work out at about 20%. Of these typically 30% of the totals are employee contributions.\nIn the late 80’s I was involved with the setting up of two employer money-purchase (defined contribution) schemes. I cannot recall exactly what contribution levels we settled on, but I am pretty sure the combined contributions were less than 10% of salary. This indicates that at least half of the public sector contribution levels could be replaced by fund growth. According to Hutton the cost of the public sector employer contributions (70% of the combined total) is around £30bn, so half the combined total would be in excess of £20bn.\nEmployer Participation\nEmployer participation is rooted in the days when employers adopted a patrician attitude, and when jobs were for life. For me this simply does not fit with a libertarian approach or with the flexibility people now require for careers involving many different employers and for varying life-styles. The employer’s pension contributions are all part of the salary package and in my opinion the employee should have maximum flexibility on how that is deployed.\nThe simplest way of doing this is to set the reduced total contribution rate, 10%, as the employee’s contribution by adding the amount transferred from the employer’s contribution onto gross salary. That would on average represent an increase in gross salary of 4%. The resulting benefits in terms of transportability, flexibility and administrative cost were set out above and are I trust self-explanatory. In the early years the employers’ contributions would still be required for cash-flow purposes, but would phase out later as the fund builds up, though as these would boil down to borrowing either way there is no need to retain the link.\nThe next question is should this be a compulsory employee contribution, or could employees opt to receive some or all of it in pay now? The national interest surely does not extend beyond ensuring that as many people as possible are not dependent on the state for non-pension benefits in retirement, so we have to look at the overall position.\nThe role of the State Pension\nMany people have noted the absurdity of the National Insurance system when there is no separate insurance fund to pay for those services. In fact almost all the NIC contributions go towards paying for the state pension on a pay-as-you-go basis. Total NIC receipts in 2014/5 were £110bn whereas the total cost of both state pensions and pension credits came to just over £95bn. However ONS forecasts suggest this cost will have risen to over £435bn by 2062/63, or nearly £500bn if you add in other benefits paid to pensioners such as housing benefit and disability benefit. Clearly this is unsustainable unless massive changes are introduced.\nPossible ways of meeting this cost could include:\n• Increasing the statutory retirement age (already increased to 68 by then)\n• Funding\n• Increasing employee NIC’s\n• Introducing clawback where pensioners have other income over a certain threshold, say £25k. A clawback rate of 50% would then give a taper up to around £40k. This would also be in line with the insurance description of the contributions.\n• Allowing Inheritance Tax relief (or CGT relief in the hands of the beneficiary if IHT is abolished but replaced by CGT) for legacies paid into a pension fund (or to pay off student loans for that matter!)\n• Allowing members to switch state pension funds into other pension schemes for a reduction in qualifying years.\nThe answer probably lies in a combination of all of these, but I do also suggest that when an individual’s total pension provision, taking state, employer, private schemes and SIPPs all added together, at any age exceeds the annuity cost of providing a pension from that age at the top of the benefit tapers, then they should no longer be required to pay NPCs. The same test could be applied to reducing public sector contribution rates.\nHi John, this is quite interesting but for many ordinary people who have worked all their lives have been left far short of a Living Pension, many time there has been meetings between Government and Age Concern for a decent Pension, both Political Parties always claim there is not enough money to pay Pensioners a decent Pension, so of recent time shall we look at what they have been spending, firstly on their own Increases, a Back Bencher who was on £64.000 received £7000 increase, this was more than a Pensioner receives for one whole year to live on being £6504, a Cabinet Minister received £14.500 on top of their Salary, what Cameron received is not known to me, by their own figures used at the DWP the lowest amount to live on is £155 per week, what Pensioners receive is £127 and the rest if they are lucky enough to get it is made up from Pension Credit which is means tested, so now tell me where is the shortage of money when ever it comes down to their own increases, they speak of Bankers giving themselves huge Bonuses even though they have made a Loss, so what is the difference when the Government fouls up and they also receive a huge increase for doing so, what is above is fine if you have Money but for many Pensioners are dying every Winter because they cannot afford to heat their Homes and feed themselves, Pensioner John need real help as many are in difficulty, help with my Petition and lets get some respecr back to those who have worked hard all their lives and for what, a smack in the face from whatever Government is in Power, take care Graham Booth in Nottingham.\nhttps://www.change.org/p/rt-hon-theresa-may-mp-rt-hon-david-cameron-mp-save-our-pensioners-and-give-them-some-dignity-in-old-age?recruiter=265758476&utm_source=share_petition&utm_medium=copylink\nLikeLike",

  "https_jepoynton_com_/https_jepoynton_com_2017_05_07_reducing-the-income-and-regional-gaps/content_62.html": "Many people voted to LEAVE the EU in the referendum because they felt impoverished and left behind. A more technical way of expressing this is that the income and regional gaps have widened considerably since globalisation, the single market and the opening of our borders. Whilst most of the electorate may not understand the technicalities, it is important we can answer the question “How” if we say we will tackle this problem. So here are six critical policies designed to achieve a reduction in both the income and regional gaps thereby directly addressing the referendum result. There was little about this in our 2015 manifesto so we do now need to address it more clearly.\n1. Measure them!\nSpeaking as an experienced management consultant, if you want everyone to focus on a problem produce regular statistics on it. In this case we should get the ONS to produce statistical series calculating the Standard Deviation of Incomes around the Mean, and also the Standard Deviation of Unemployment Rates by Post Code around the Mean. People will soon understand that if the numbers go up the gaps are getting wider and vice-versa. That’s all they need to know.\n2. Establish Reliable Unemployment statistics.\nTo the best of my knowledge the current unemployment statistics exclude under-employed self-employed people, part-time employment and zero-hours contracts, and people sanctioned off benefits. Partly this is because these details are difficult to collect. I therefore advocate setting up an Online Self-reporting of Employment Status system in combination with Welfare Self-assessment for the Self-employed, payable weekly or monthly on receipt of the online employment returns. These could be cross-checked on a sample basis. Not only would this ensure that self-employed people are not overlooked by the benefits system, but also we would get much more detailed information on under-employment levels. It would bring the welfare system into line with modern employment patterns, and these statistics could then be fed into regional policy (see below).\n3. Controlling our borders.\nI put this in here for completeness. We all understand wage compression.\n4. Shareholder Supervisory Boards.\nReducing the income gap means we must tackle the issue of executive pay just as much as the issue of low pay. This is not about the politics of envy; it is simply to ensure that an open competitive market is operating for the executive labour market. At present it is not for two reasons, the first being that shareholders are not in control.\nOnly the other day the shareholders of a company, Crest Nicholson, voted 70% to 30% to reject a proposal from their directors for a pay increase. Yet the directors simple ignored it on the grounds that such votes are only advisory. This is not acceptable.\nFurther, during the banking crisis, it was the directors who were playing “Masters of the Universe” not the shareholders who indeed lost their money. If the shareholders had been in control the more extreme practices and takeovers could have been averted.\nNowadays shareholders are not little old ladies and retired vicars as in Victorian days, which was when their powers were limited, but highly trained and expert fund managers such as those at your pension fund and mine. These fund managers are more than capable of making these decisions on our behalf.\nI therefore advocate that Shareholder Supervisory Boards be required for all publicly quoted companies. These could comprise the six largest shareholders on the register at the time a meeting is called plus the Chairman, Chief Executive and one Non-Exec. They would determine what motions would be put to the AGM regarding executive pay, takeovers and mergers, capital reconstructions and the appointment of the auditors. And of course henceforth AGM decisions must be binding on the directors.\n5. Cheapest Competent Candidate.\nBoth for publicly listed companies and throughout the public sector this procedure should be mandatory for the appointment of senior executives and professional staff.\nWhat is needed for executive pay is not a cap (crude, interventionist and redolent of envy) but an open competitive market.\nAt present senior executives are recruited by head-hunters behind closed doors and pay increases likewise by remuneration committees. Invariably the head-hunters cover their backsides by finding just one candidate who has done virtually the same job at the same level before. This person then realises he is the only one in the frame and demands the earth. Yet large organisations are no different to the armed forces where we have all heard the adage that you end up with more admirals than ships and more generals than tanks. They recruit well, train well and promote well so you get a great tsunami of talent surging up into the little pinnacle at the top with nowhere to go. Their claim that there are only a few people who can do these jobs is demonstrably false.\nThere is no shortage of talent at all, so we must force head-hunters and recruiters to dip their toes much deeper into the pool of talent by a legal requirement to put at least five names on each short-list. You then simply ask the short-listed candidates to bid for the job, just as you would with a contractor.\nI would allow Shareholder Supervisory Boards to choose any resulting candidate since the process itself will have moderated demands, but the pure public sector should always appoint the lowest bidding candidate.\n6. Regional discounts on Income Tax and Business Rates.\nPrevious governments have tried to address regional policy though a range of expenditure programmes. These invariably have been either ineffective or soon forgotten and discontinued. We need a permanent structural solution, and the most potent approach would be through the tax system.\nI therefore advocate discounts for both income tax and business rates proportional to local rates of unemployment post code by post code across the country (see above). These will allow residents to retain more of their earnings, much of which they will spend locally thereby reducing unemployment. The cost will be largely cyclical, but the £25bn of import tariff revenues a clean Brexit will produce will underwrite it. A strong regional policy will also leave the SNP dead in the water as well as replacing the Barnet Formula.",
  "https_jepoynton_com_/https_jepoynton_com_2017_12_01_helpful-advice-for-henry-following-question-time-on-3oth-november/content_36.html": "Thought you might be interested in the email I have sent Henry Bolton following his appearance on Question time last night, as follows:\nDear Henry,\nFirst of all, congratulations on a very solid performance on Question Time last night. You have my full support. I am sorry I missed you on 25th November but we were in France. I have set up a monthly standing order in favour of Make Brexit Happen.\nIn the light of this I hope you will take the following contribution in the constructive and positive manner in which it is intended. I felt you missed a couple of crucial points.\nWith regard to the Brexit negotiations, the core reason why Theresa May is making such a pig’s ear of them is that she wants a trade deal. It is this that has completely undermined her negotiating position and allowed Michel Barnier to take her to the cleaners. But a trade deal with the EU would be an economic catastrophe for this country in any event.\nThis is because any balanced deal would increase both imports and exports by roughly the same percentage. So if you start with a deficit, as we have, it will only increase that deficit because everything will go up in proportion. It’s just primary school mathematics, yet nobody seems capable of understanding it least of all our inept Prime Minister.\nOur trade deficit is the root cause both of our increasing debt bubble and of the low investment and productivity growth paradigm we have been stuck in for the past thirty years, and which accelerated with the banking crisis ten years ago. We are blindly careering headlong towards another financial crisis, except that this time it will be ordinary people who go bankrupt and not just the banks. And now we also have an industrial strategy white paper which aims to touch the taxpayer for enormous sums for investment which should instead be coming from the City.\nA trade deficit is like having a hole in the bottom of our economic barrel. Wealth, jobs and consumer demand are pouring out of it all the time. If nothing were done unemployment would go through the roof. However the Bank of England came up with a cunning wheeze called Quantitative Easing – basically printing more money. This has the effect of reducing interest rates thereby encouraging people to borrow their future income to spend today to plug the hole in the barrel. But as Mervyn King himself pointed out very succinctly in his recent book, The End of Alchemy, this can only be a temporary fix. Sooner or later tomorrow becomes today and everyone has run out of income and cannot borrow any more. Even if they can manage in the short term on existing levels of debt, as soon as interest rates start to rise they will be caught out, just as the rise in oil prices caught out Americans with sub-prime mortgages last time.\nLow interest rates also reduce the level of savings. This starves the banks of money to lend for investment, and low investment leads to low productivity growth. Today our average real standard of living is around 25% lower than it was in the late 1980s, which is when unbalanced globalisation kicked in. You can find a graph of this on my website at jepoynton.com/2016/05/08/the-economic-consequensces-of-immigration. Remainians as well as some Brexiteers talk blandly about free trade as though it were some sort of general panacea for all our ills. It is not. Yes there are many studies which show a strong correlation between free trade and economic growth, but what everyone misses is that there is also a strong correlation between that growth and those countries which run trade surpluses. Think of all the countries which have done well since WW2 – Germany, Japan and China for example; all have run massive trade surpluses. In other words the surplus countries get all the benefits, leaving the deficit countries with nothing. Indeed worse than that, there is also a transfer of existing wealth between them. That is why we and the Americans, both of whom run huge trade deficits, have suffered such a catastrophic fall in our standards of living. And to make matters even worse, there has been a big increase in both the pay and regional gaps on both sides of the pond so that wealthy Remainians can afford to close their ears and claim “I’m all right Jack so let’s just carry on indulging our middle-class guilt complexes”.\nFor all these reasons eliminating our trade deficit must be our primary national economic objective (together with setting up a Sovereign Wealth Fund to hedge our National Debt and which ironically the low interest rates make eminently feasible), yet here we have a Prime Minister busily engaged in doing precisely the opposite. It’s time she was called out. We must balance our trade first before we can afford to increase its volume. Not only that, we cannot afford to forego the £25 billion or so that trading under WTO rules would bring in import tariffs. We would presumably simply put in place a mirror image of the EU tariffs, which would then both reduce our fiscal deficit and reduce our imports by creating import substitution. In other words people would find British products and services better value and that in turn would create thousands of extra jobs; more in fact than those created by extra exports under a trade deal. Exporters obviously want a trade deal and subscribe to Conservative Party coffers accordingly, but they are only looking at one side of the coin. The other side is bigger!\nThere are only two ways you can manage a trade deficit; devaluation and import tariffs, both of which are only available through Brexit. The markets determine the level of our currency, so that just leaves import tariffs as a direct policy instrument. I know some will accuse me of protectionism for this, but surely balancing our trade is more important. I don’t advocate big unilateral increases in import tariffs as obviously these run the risk of starting trade wars, but a negotiated approach is still an option and failing that a gradual increase aimed at those imports where we can substitute must make sense. Our policy should be to establish a surplus of between zero and 1% of GDP.\nAs regards the Irish border, I am sure a system of self-declaration by importers backed up by spot checks would be sufficient. We would need ANPR and CCTV cameras at the crossing points so that spot checks could be carried out elsewhere within Northern Ireland and at crossings into mainland Britain, but nothing solid at the border itself. As far as people are concerned we do need full information on who is arriving into the Republic, including bio identification data, so we can look out for them if they don’t leave the Republic when they should or if they show in up Northern Ireland or at a crossings into mainland Britain or beyond. This simply requires a bilateral deal with the Irish government and should not involve the EU at all. I see no reason why the Republic should refuse such a joint project, especially if we contribute to our share of it, but if they do then a hard border is unavoidable. We must make clear that the ball is firmly in their court over this.\nNor do I see why EU citizens should be given preferential treatment within the UK compared to citizens of, say, Outer Mongolia. That surely is exactly the type of discrimination we argue so strongly against. Of course we must expect the EU to treat our citizens (including myself with our house in France!) on the same basis as we do theirs, but an immigration system on a two-tier basis as I set out on my website at jepoynton.com/2017/01/14/balanced-migration would surely be acceptable all round whilst also achieving our objective of balanced migration.\nOn a completely separate issue I was uncomfortable with the way most of your co-panellists immediately jumped onto the populist race-hatred bandwagon over Donald Trump’s re-tweets of Britain First’s videos, when in fact those videos simply reported factually and without comment Muslim aggression towards whites and disrespect for the catholic faith. Through your co-panellists’ preoccupation with platforming and value signalling they overlooked the facts and ended up contradicting themselves, blaming the messenger rather than the message and in effect condoning the violence! It was an opportunity to call them out for it.\nAs you rightly said there is a serious debate to be had regarding Islamic imperialism and cultural displacement within the UK. The point must be made that this is not race hatred but a genuine concern arising from high levels of immigration. It’s about numbers not cultural diversity. Multiculturalism is a natural extension of libertarianism which UKIP strongly supports. Live and let live.\nIf they think Britain First is guilty of hate crime in this instance then prosecute them for it, as they have been in the past. A guilty verdict could then give some basis for rescinding Trump’s invitation, though I personally would still not support it. An acquittal would call them out! That is how we should do justice in this country. As it is Theresa May’s tetchy reaction leaves her looking foolish and diplomatically inept.\nAmericans do not see or understand the asymmetric imperialist guilt-complex that afflicts so much of the British establishment these days. They take things straight and will see these videos for what they are; no different to the reports we see nightly on the BBC News about atrocities committed by ISIL and the Taliban. So should we. Whilst Donald Trump may be more a perpetrator of fake news than the recipient of it, in this instance at least he appears to have hit the nail on the head. Let us unambiguously applaud him for doing so and welcome him to this country.\nI hope you will find the ideas on my website useful – they are almost all on economic policy – and that we can meet up sometime soon to discuss them.\nWith best wishes,\nJohn Poynton FCA",
  "https_jepoynton_com_/https_jepoynton_com_2022_12_05_misinterpretation-is-not-racism/content_3.html": "It is extremely unlikely that Lady Sarah Hussey meant any offence when she asked Ndozi Fulani where she came from at a Buckingham Palace reception last week. She was helping the Queen Consort entertain her guests; a role she has been playing for decades having been Lady in Waiting to the late Queen, and was simply taking an interest in her guest by way of conversation. It is perfectly normal to ask someone about their background in such situations. The late Queen did so constantly and indeed liked to be briefed in advance about whom she was going to meet.\nIf someone asks me where I come from I simply say Croydon. If I want to extend the conversation I say my mother was Welsh and father born and bred in Oxford. Still further back my ancestors were a mixture of immigrant Vikings, Normans and Saxons. To be able to say my parents came to this country from Barbados but that I was born here and am now a British citizen, as Fulani (born Mary Headley) could have done, would be much more interesting. Why couldn’t she have just said so nicely and politely? Ancestry is a very popular subject. The BBC has a whole series devoted to it. Nobody accuses them of racism.\nMuch has been made of how Lady Hussey pressed the point after an initial hostile reaction, but she would naturally have wanted to clarify the situation after being taken aback. Unfortunately it only made the situation worse, but how was she to know that? More likely Fulani was deliberately milking the situation as she appears to be making something of a career for herself insulting the Royal Family. According to returns to the Charities Commission her charity was set up in 2018 and has received £350,000 since then, but has not made any significant disbursements to anyone other than Ms. Fulani herself. The Palace should strengthen its due diligence procedures. Then she really would have been excluded!\nMost of us do now know that black British citizens are peculiarly sensitive on this point. I myself have had the same experience and we learn that way. We are not mind-readers. I now avoid asking that question of black people, but that is my choice as a matter of individual moral sensitivity. Racism is defined in the dictionary as the belief that some races are inherently superior to others. Absolutely nothing in what Lady Hussey said indicated she ascribed to such a belief. Fulani simply misinterpreted the conversation – quite possibly deliberately.\nWe had the same situation arise in The Duchess of Sussex’s interview with Oprah Winfrey where she revealed that “questions had be asked about Archie’s skin colour”. Note, she did not say that “concerns had been raised …..”, which is what the media invariably reported. It is perfectly normal for prospective relatives to speculate about an unborn child’s characteristics and, for example, which parent they might more resemble. In the case of mixed-race parents skin colour is an obvious interest.\nIt is highly regrettable now that the Palace has caved in to the criticism and thrown Lady Hussey to the wolves. If anything Ms. Fulani owes Lady Hussey an abject apology for the distress she has caused. The late Queen would am I sure have shown much more backbone. She might have issued a statement along the following lines:\n“It is with deep regret that we have learned of a substantial misunderstanding last week between a member of the royal household and a black guest at a reception here at Buckingham Palace. The guest is claiming she had been subjected to racist questioning. Opinions on this may vary but may I take the opportunity to reassure our black community that no offence was intended and that we value highly the involvement of black people in British life today.\nMisunderstandings are commonplace in life, particularly where people of different backgrounds come together. Let us all learn from such experiences and always try to understand the other person’s point of view. I am sure we can overcome such differences and see the good in others, as well as the shortcomings in ourselves, and that way develop peace and understanding amongst us all.”",
  "https_jepoynton_com_/https_jepoynton_com_page_6/content_21.html": "Probably the most frequent questions I was asked during the recent campaign concerned the NHS. And it wasn’t just about funding, an issue I addressed in an earlier article. People were concerned about the way it is being managed, its inefficiency, and about the outsourcing of NHS services to the private sector.\nAs it happens, early on in the campaign I attended a seminar addressed by Simon Stevens, the Chief Executive of NHS England, and I asked him for the staff turnover figures for doctors and nurses across the NHS, and for the percentage of staff who were on temporary contracts. He avoided giving me any figures. Whether this was because he did not want to, or because he did not know them I am not sure, so I went on to ask why his board did not include any resource-specialist directors such a Human Resources Director, Finance Director (although there is someone they rather begrudgingly call their chief financial officer), IT Director or Facilities Director. How, I asked, could he be held responsible for the performance of the NHS without such a board. He immediately replied that he could not!\nNow I have no reason to suppose he was just being flippant in giving this reply. I suspect the real reason is that his brief is not one of chief executive that we in the private sector would recognise. Which in turn means that there is no one properly in charge. It is rather like a manufacturing company where the MD has five production directors and a bookkeeper! Clearly it is impossible for such a board to keep tabs on all the resources within the organisation, of which its staff are its most important. No wonder we end up with a health service where the supply of doctors and nurses cannot keep up with demand, where staff turnover has gone through the roof, where a high proportion are expensive agency staff, and where half of those cannot speak English anyway. It came as no surprise therefore when a debate erupted after the election about the shortage of doctors and nurses in the NHS!\nAnother concern frequently expressed was how difficult it is to find anyone in the NHS capable of taking the initiative and making decisions. It would appear that the top-down prescriptive, target-orientated management methodology introduced by Tony Blair’s New Labour government is still in place. The whole thing is upside down. You want your doctors and nurses at the sharp end dealing with the patients and doing the research. They are then in a position to propose the changes and budgets necessary drive their own local units forward in response to the needs of their patients. The role of the board is three-fold: to assess these initiatives, to provide the resources they require, and to monitor the use of all resources across the NHS so as to maximise utilisation and efficiency. That just not appears to be happening at present. I accept that there may also be a need for some central initiatives as well, but not at the expense of the reactive ones.\nAlmost all of our public services are conglomerate in nature; that is they comprise groups of units operating at specialist or local level and accountable through central management to their ultimate owners, Parliament. The most successful method of managing conglomerates is technique perfected by Arnold Weinstock at GEC during the 60s, 70s and 80s which I call comparative management by results. Weinstock famously used just seven key financial indicators (they would of course be different and more diverse in the public sector, but the principle is the same) to compare the performance of all the subsidiaries in the group, and then started kicking arse from the bottom of the list upwards. These numbers aren’t good enough, he would bellow down the line. You are in the bottom half of the list. What are you going to do about it? I want your proposals on my desk by Friday lunchtime” or whatever. If they could improve well and good, but if they could not they were replaced. It was as simple as that.\nCompare this approach to that taken by New Labour, which I call ‘top down prescriptive methodology’. “Tick these boxes. Follow these procedures. Meet these targets. Do it this way and stick your head in the sand while you’re at it”! Weinstock never told his MDs how to do their job; these were expensive, experience people who should already know that; it was what he was paying them for. He was only interested in results. His only other major role was to accumulate and allocate capital funds for investment, and if he could get a better return elsewhere he did so. His ‘cash mountain’ became famous.\nThe difference between the two approaches is striking, but what is also telling is that Weinstock seldom if ever got involved directly with his customers or even with what they were actually buying from GEC. That was all delegated; in other words ‘localised’. Even more so is the role and importance of central management. Weinstock’s head office was tiny. I went there once, just a five story terraced building in Stanhope Gate, but it was only by having a central team that he was able to manage the company in this way.\nIt is also worth noting that New Labour’s approach was to set absolute targets. This may have been politically convenient, but has the drawback that any target will have a resourcing implication, and if that implication is not addressed then the result will be chaos, which of course is precisely what happened. Weinstock’s approach on the other hand was comparative. He knew what was possible by looking at the companies at the top of the list, and simply expected the others to do as well. And when you think about it, this is precisely how an open competitive market works; the choices available to consumers are comparative both in price (efficiency) and quality.\nNow look at what is actually happening out there! We keep hearing of schools and hospitals being ‘put into special measures’, which involves drafting in a whole raft of interim managers, none of whom know anything about the organisation they going in to manage, none of whom will be there in a year’s time or have any permanent commitment to it, and all of whom are being paid massive fees. I saw one case recently where ten such managers had been drafted into a hospital, all of whom were being paid in excess of £100k pa, and the chief honcho at a rate in excess of £500k pa! OMG! What a total and utter waste of time and public money. All you have to do is change the guy in charge and then support him.\nBut if you thought that was bad enough, look at Social Services. They don’t have anyone in charge at all. They are quite literally running around like headless chickens. It’s all very well to say that such services are run by local authorities, but the money comes from central government and when things go wrong we expect ministers to take responsibility. Local authorities are simply not physically in a position to make the comparative assessments required or allocate resources according to demand.\nI suspect the source of the problem lies in the structure of the spending departments themselves. How many of them have a clear structural separation between their advisory side, with its responsibility to advise ministers of current problems and future needs, and their executive side, with its responsibility to deliver a mandate approved by Parliament? Taking it from the top therefore, I would expect to see:-\n– A National Director General / Chief Executive (DG) for each and every public service reporting directly to the relevant Secretary of State and his Permanent Secretary. There could be several within a given department depending on the breadth of that department’s responsibilities.\n– The advisory side of the department organized on a pool basis, such as you would find in a firm of accountants or solicitors, managed through the use of timesheets, project budgets and activity percentages, and run by an Under-Secretary.\n– Each DG having a board of directors covering the full range of functional responsibilities, including HR, Finance, IT, Facilities, internal audit and inspection, and others as may be appropriate, with the Executive side structured on a traditional hierarchical basis.\n– Every level of management under the DG having the power to hire and fire the next level down. This is essential for both authority and accountability.\n– A comprehensive quarterly Management Information System (MIS) covering all key performance and efficiency indicators across the service, including management accounts, enabling comparisons to be made and follow-up action taken where necessary. It is important to emphasise that these indicators are not targets, simply monitoring procedures. It is often said that a good MIS only poses questions; it does not provide answers.\n– Each DG having full and complete autonomy over the allocation of his budget, with no ring-fencing or other restrictions. To the extent that Parliament has decreed certain levels of provision within the service, these should simply be monitored through the MIS.\n– The Board including a non-exec Customer Representative, to whom local governors and customer representatives can report on a functional basis. Each local board would have a similar position, possibly elected locally. Our manifesto commitment for elected county representatives fitted this requirement neatly.",
  "https_jepoynton_com_/https_jepoynton_com_2022_08_09_how-does-cutting-taxes-help-combat-a-recession/content_44.html": "This is a question recently posed on Quora where I frequently post. Here is my answer.\nDepends how it is funded. If that is by corresponding cuts in government expenditure then the net effect will be zero. However if it is by increasing borrowing then net demand in the economy is increased. That is what we have seen since the banking crisis and to combat the ever-increasing trade deficit with the EU over the past twenty years which has destroyed jobs. The result is record levels of both national and personal debt. Indeed they have over-done it which is one of several reasons why we now have a shortage of labour.\nIt is worth noting at this point that increasing demand in the economy to reduce unemployment, sometimes referred to as Keynesian economics after the way the famous economist John Maynard Keynes advocated ending the depression of the 1930’s, is not at all the same thing as economic growth in our standard of living (GDP per capita). “Treasury Orthodoxy”, now being blamed by the Tory leadership candidates for the lack of growth, is to balance the books over the course of the economic cycle, not year by year. That allows for borrowing during a recession to reduce unemployment provided it is paid back during a boom so that debt as a percentage of GDP remains constant or falling. Whilst it has nothing directly to do with growth it does lead to a disposition in favour of inflation to reduce the debt rather than balancing the books with tax increases or expenditure reductions. Inflation reduces real interest rates and hence savings and investment thereby undermining growth.\nInternationally there is much evidence to suggest that smaller government produces higher rates of economic growth, the logic being that high levels of government expenditure uses up finance available for investment and therefore ‘crowds out’ the private sector which produces most of that growth because it is subject to competition. In the UK however the electorate demands expensive public services (eg the NHS) and a reliable welfare state making that difficult to achieve. That means separate policies are required to make public services much more efficient (the potential is huge, not least from introducing some proper accountable top management for each service) as well as finding other sources of finance, such as a Sovereign Wealth Fund or optional means-tested access to the private sector for services, if we are to reduce tax levels permanently. This is the essence of a centrist, radical economic strategy.\nOver the past twenty years we have seen very little growth in our standard of living, This “productivity gap” is in fact a direct result of our increasing trade deficit with the EU, which presents British business with a contracting market and thereby little incentive to invest, and of open borders causing increasing levels of structural unemployment (the mismatch between people and jobs by skills and location. Square pegs will not go into round holes). Interestingly record levels of immigration have not provided any boost to growth. Only a quota system for legal immigration will solve that. The points-based system, which Tony Blair introduced in 2006, is too easily gerrymandered in favour of Big Business, thereby creating a self-perpetuating immigration spiral. Unless business is forced to train up British workers by a quota system the levels of structural unemployment will just get higher. A Tory government will never do this as their donors in business will not allow it.\nThe main condition for growth is investment by British business which carries more efficient means of production (productivity). For that you need both an expanding market and available additional labour resources. If you try to increase demand when there is a shortage of labour the result will be a combination of increased inflation, immigration and imports, the last giving all the investment benefit to foreign business. Open borders also imports wage compression which offsets the inflation and so masks the alarm bells at the Bank of England, which uses inflation as an indicator of an over-heated economy and the need to increase interest rates to control it. Hence the immigration spiral.\nMany of us remember the Boom and Bust at the end of the 1980’s when Nigel Lawson’s 1987 budget cut income taxes substantially just when the economy was expanding as a result of Geoffrey Howe’s earlier cuts in credit controls. The result was that people used the extra money in their pockets to jack up their mortgages and chase up house prices.\nThe only way now to present British business with a sustainable expanding market is to reduce and eventually eliminate that trade deficit with the EU. This has grown steadily over the past 22 years to over 6% GDP while our trade with the rest of the world has moved from deficit to a steady 1% surplus. This divergence demonstrates clearly how the EU acts surreptitiously and maliciously to block our exports, (probably in revenge for us not joining the Euro), and the Tory deal has just allowed them to keep on doing that. Only a full No Deal Brexit will give us legal protection from such practices under the WTO’s ‘most favoured nation’ principle which applies where no bilateral trade agreement is in place. Furthermore it would enable us to use tariffs to offset the EU non-tariff barriers and take back control of our economic sovereignty as well as our legal sovereignty. Free trade on top of a deficit only increases that deficit and makes matters worse – simple mathematics!\nFurthermore recovering £120 billion of trade deficit improves total GDP by that amount which in turn improves the tax base which produces about one-third of GDP as tax revenues. That means an extra £40 billion of tax revenues without increasing tax rates one iota.\nIt is interesting that neither of the Tory leadership candidates has drawn a distinction between the cost-push inflation that is now being imported on oil and gas wholesale prices, and over which no amount of increased interest rates will have any effect at all, and the monetary inflation resulting from government mismanagement and over-heating of the internal economy. We have to address both types separately with separate policies.\nCutting direct fuel and energy taxes makes a lot of sense to offset the imported inflation and keep domestic fuel and energy prices stable, thereby cutting off a wage/price spiral at the knees. Means-testing energy bills will also reduce the cost of this and ensure the poorest get the most help, at least pro-tem until the danger has passed. This will probably prevent most of the forecast recession. This can be done by enabling householders to direct their energy suppliers to send their bills direct to the taxman, who will pay them. The taxmen then applies the means-test to the increase since the start of the Ukraine War and recharges the householder through their PAYE code or deduction from benefits. Similarly for business, the taxman can agree to pay a percentage of the increase in return for a profit cap. For example if 100% of the increase is accepted the profit cap would be 1%, whereas for 25% it could be 4%, or some such gradient.\nThere has been the usual nonsense from Labour about imposing price caps, but this would inevitably lead to blackouts and supply shortages. There has also been talk of windfall taxes on suppliers without any consideration of what level of profits is normal and necessary for investment. Energy company profits comprise a significant parts of most pension fund portfolios. However a profit cap set at say 5% before tax does make sense as a general policy which should also include wind and solar farms.\nThen we all the nonsense about converting to electric cars. These are now actually more expensive to run than petrol cars! Not only that, but the electricity that comes out of your socket is hybrid! If it is generated that way, as it is because of the proportion that comes from gas, then what comes out will be hybrid as there is no way of separating them in the grid. Indeed many of the blackouts now predicted for this winter will be due to electric cars. It would take massive investment to expand the National Grid to cope with everyone plugging in their electric cars at the same time, and supplying electricity in this way involves substantial transmission losses. Far better to go for hydrogen-hybrid and carry your fuel around with you just like petrol.\nHowever in parallel with all this the Bank of England must get its act together on interest rates to get some flexibility back into the labour market. I should also like to see them given a quite separate target to stabilize house prices using credit controls, as house price inflation often leads general inflation. The former will be difficult as there are a number of other factors which have glued up the labour market. Incredibly we now have a record 8% of the working-age population who are classified as economically inactive. Whilst much of this is the result of many years of open borders, it is also due to the botched implementation of Universal Credits, IR35, the traditional poverty trap as well as hangover from the Covid restrictions.\nPerhaps the silver lining is that 10% inflation on top of a £2 trillion national debt releases an extra £200 billion for government expenditure if the aim is to keep the debt at a constant percentage of GDP in line with treasury orthodoxy. My suggestion would be to save half and spend half, and allocate half the spending to tax cuts and half to budget increases. That should be sufficient to knee-cap energy prices and provide some protection from inflation for public-sector workers and those in need as well as fund essential public services acceptably.",
  "https_jepoynton_com_/https_jepoynton_com_2015_11_23_unaffordable-housing/content_55.html": "Continuing my new series taking issue with Sunday Telegraph columnists, this week it is the turn of Jeremy Warner, who yesterday wrote some very strange things under the heading ‘Unaffordable housing’.\nNow to be fair his diagnosis was spot on. He reported that average real house prices in London have soared by almost 40% since the beginning of 2013, and concluded that the three primary causes of this are under-supply, intense overseas buying and virtually unbridled immigration. So far so good.\nIt is with his prescription that he goes belly up, writing “I’m all in favour of free movement of labour, and on high levels of inward investment, but if you are to have these things it is incumbent on the Government to ensure adequate supply and the infrastructure to service it.”\nLet’s take these factors in order. Since 2004, when the immigration floodgates opened, our average real standard of living has fallen by over 20% (see ONS statistics). Indeed if you factor out an annual one percent for productivity growth, that is a fall of over 30%. Of course some of this is due to the banking crisis, but on another page Liam Halligan helpfully tells us that “our economy endured a 7.2% peak-to-trough drop after the banking crisis”. He doesn’t tell us where he got this figure from, and I suspect it is a tad understated, but let us accept it for the time being. That means that a fall of over 20% was due entirely to immigration (unless you can think of any other possible factor commencing in 2004?).\nNow at first sight this conclusion might seem counter-intuitive. After all most immigrants do work hard and pay their taxes, and we are constantly being told that the NHS would collapse without them. But you know you can argue the whys and wherefores until the cows come home. I was always taught to judge by results. And those results, particularly in the week following the Paris atrocities, are unequivocal. Immigration is hugely damaging to our standard of living as well as to our security, our environment, our infrastructure and our housing provision. At these levels it also results in cultural swamping. I have no difficulty with cultural diversity, nor with our historic commitment to taking in refugees from persecution, but when the numbers and population density reach these levels we are in a completely different ball game.\nThen there is the question of inward investment. For decades successive governments have preached the benefits of inward investment and have done all they can to encourage it. But again I say judge by results. Where are all these benefits? I don’t see any. What I do see is a record balance of payments deficit in excess of 5% GDP, which of course exports jobs and undermines employment. Inward investment has the effect of pushing up our exchange rate and making our currency uncompetitive.\nWe should stop encouraging it forthwith. I have no difficulty with foreign ownership as all who invest here must obey our laws, but there is plenty of money sloshing around the money markets, especially post QE, and corporate savings are at high levels. Domestically sourced investment will naturally follow an increase in consumer demand.\nFinally there is Jeremy’s frustration at our planning laws. Jeremy, those planning laws are there for a reason. They are there to protect our heritage, our habitat and our environment. Once these things are destroyed they cannot be recovered. I do accept that there may be insufficient brown field sites to provide the housing necessary to make good the current shortfall, particularly if mixed development is provided as of course it should be. I would also favour the creation of a new planning category for what I would call, for want of a better name, scrub land, ie undeveloped land of no particular alternative merit. I would certainly favour a big increase in stamp duty for foreign buyers of UK domestic property.\nBut even if we do all these things we have no chance of keeping up with ‘virtually unbridled immigration’. Balanced migration has to be the starting point, and of course that can only be achieved by leaving the EU.",
  "https_jepoynton_com_/https_jepoynton_com_2016_09_01_do-i-believe-in-free-trade/content_54.html": "The almost universally held and unquestioned belief in free trade, that is trade unhindered by either blockade or tariffs, is generally attributed to the classical economist David Ricardo, who included a chapter on Foreign Trade in his famous book The Principles of Political Economy and Taxation published in 1817. The modern mantra holds that free trade drives investment, productivity and economic growth through increased competition from imports.\nAllowing for the fact that Ricardo was writing before modern terms such as ‘value added’, ‘productivity’, ‘money supply’ or ‘GDP’ were introduced, he in fact makes no mention of this effect at all! His only mention of productivity comes when he is examining the effect on the economies of two countries engaged in balanced trade when one finds a more efficient method of production. The result is a trade surplus by that country resulting in an increased money supply, which in turn creates inflation, which in turn rebalances the trade by attracting more imports. In his argument the productivity increase is the cause of increased competition, not the result of it. He also notes the benefits of specialisation, where different countries have different natural advantages in the production of certain goods, but makes no suggestion that these advantages are anything other than fixed. That is all.\nRicardo wrote at a time when most money was fixed in the form of precious metals and thus before the advent of floating exchange rates and mega currency capital flows. His arguments preclude the possibility of the sort of structural trade imbalances we see today.\nOf course there are numerous papers to be found on the internet and elsewhere arguing that free trade enhances economic growth. Invariably the writer will point to periods of economic growth, such as the post-war decades or the decade following the exit from the ERM, and notes the coincidence with an expansion in free trade. Closer inspection however reveals plenty of alternative possible causes, such as peace, reconstruction, stability and devaluation. So the logic is by no means conclusive.\nI am well aware also of the classical arguments around specialisation and economies of scale. However these have now been superseded by globalisation and the advent of off-shoring. Richard Baldwin, author of “The Great Convergence: Information Technology and the New Globalisation”, gives the example of the Canadian company Bombardier that transferred the production of aircraft tails from Quebec to Mexico. He says “The ICT revolution made it feasible for rich-nation firms to leverage their knowledge with low-wage workers abroad. Bombardier can now use its know-how to make aircraft tails with Mexican manufacturing engineers who only get $60 a day instead of Canadian engineers on $35 an hour. The ability of, for example, Canadian firms to take their knowledge elsewhere means that what is good for Bombardier may not be good for Canada.” He could have added that these multinational companies also off-shore their profits, so their host nations no longer even get a share of those profits though tax.\nA related perspective comes from Mariana Mazzucato, author of “The Entrepreneurial State”, who gives a detailed account of how almost all the significant technological breakthroughs of the last seventy years, including the internet, Microsoft’s Windows, Apple’s smart-phones and Google’s search algorithm to name but a few, have their genesis in state-funded research. The private sector only became involved when the uncertainties were considerably reduced, and venture capitalists when the product was almost ready to bring to market. They then made billions for themselves from IPO’s and share buy-backs, all off-shored or reduced by favourable capital gains tax regimes negotiated on the bogus claim that they are taking the enormous risks necessary to promote innovation. The result has been that none of those profits were either returned to the state or reinvested in new research.\nWhat we are seeing now is not so much the creation of new wealth but a massive transfer of existing wealth to third world countries as a result of globalisation and unbalanced free trade. Of course it is wonderful that we can now anticipate the ending of global food poverty by 2030, but let us not kid ourselves that most of this is not at the expense of the first-world working classes. The “I’m all right, Jack” Remainian middle-class establishment has of course protected itself with a widening pay gap, leaving the burden to be carried just by the lower income groups, and they are now fed up with both the burden and the injustice of it.\nNow it is not my purpose to offer conclusive evidence or the results of research but, like the established view, rely on logic and what stands to reason. The disadvantage is that logic alone does not give any measure of the factors examined. For example, it would be logical to suppose that the law of diminishing returns applies to the competitive benefits of each 1% marginal increase in imports. With UK imports running at close on 35% of GDP it would be reasonable to assume that any competitive effect comes from the established 35% rather than from any marginal increase. It might also be reasonable to conclude that the effects of specialisation are also much diminished anyway given that most countries are now industrialising and that even England can produce wine! Any given new free trade agreement is likely to have only a one-off step benefit rather than provide the ongoing growth such as we get from innovation.\nSo my purpose rather is to examine whether such benefits are greater or less than the damage caused by structural trade deficits, and consequently our policy towards the use of import tariffs. This issue is of critical importance at present for three reasons:\n(1) it affects our approach to negotiating our disengagement from the EU, and\n(2) it affects how we tackle the outstanding imbalances which still threaten world economic and banking stability.\n(3) it highlights the damage that free-trade fanaticism can cause.\nBrexit has given us the benefit of a 10% devaluation, which should go some way toward reducing our record trade deficit, now in excess of 5% of GDP. But devaluation will almost certainly not do the whole job. The danger is that Mrs. May’s government will not now impose the maximum trade tariffs on the EU’s exports to us. We will still have to pay around 4.3% on average in tariffs on our exports to them, which we can easily afford following the devaluation, so a balanced position maintaining the status quo demands we should charge the same to them. Failure to do so will not only worsen our deficit, it will also throw away some £25bn of potential import tariff revenues; money we desperately need to plug our fiscal deficit.\nEven suppose some free trade deal were to be agreed with the EU prior to the completion of the Article 50 transition period, and even suppose this were balanced in each sides’ interests, the result would be higher imports and exports but no reduction in the deficit and the loss of the tariff revenues. Indeed the deficit would increase in proportion. As we start with a deficit, any FTA will only make it worse – the very opposite of what we want. And of course in the short term any increase in imports destroys jobs just as rapidly as exports create them, so we would have thrown away the import tariff revenues for nothing.\nThe only way we could get any advantage out of an agreement with the EU would be if it were unbalanced in our favour. That’s most unlikely to happen, particularly in view of the EU’s desire to maintain free movement of peoples. In other words they want to skew it in their favour! Forget it, we will be better off without- the WTO option is the best option. And of course there is no prospect of any sort of new Napoleonic blockade. That would be illegal under WTO rules. All we are talking about here is tariffs. Interesting how the Remain camp use the term ‘access’ to the single market to imply a blockade! Much the same applies to the term ‘free movement of people’. The vast majority will be able to come and go with just a visa, probably obtainable online! The problem only arises if they overstay that visa, and with online identification of over-stayers that should be manageable too. The important line must be drawn at citizenship and permanent leave to remain.\nAt present the rest of the world pays these tariffs to Brussels, but after Brexit the danger is they would receive the benefit of a reduction in tariffs they pay with no counterbalancing advantage to the UK. That would be a disaster. If we charge the same tariffs and then simply divert them from Brussels to London the rest of the world will not notice any difference and we will gain the revenues. There is no sign that Mrs. May’s government understands this.\nBut this debate must considered in the light of the importance of eliminating our trade deficit; something we have given almost no priority to in the past. Lord King (previously Mervyn King, Governor of the Bank of England from 2003 to 2013) has just published a fascinating and very readable book entitled “The End of Alchemy“, in which he not only proposes a new approach to bank regulation but also traces the cause of both the banking crisis and our deterioration standards of living back to the massive global trade imbalances that developed after the fall of the Berlin Wall. He makes it very clear that we must take trade deficits far more seriously than we have done in the past. Here is an extract:\n“Since the early 1990’s, long-term interest rates have fallen sharply, and this has had enormous implications for all our economies. Countries such as the United States, United Kingdom and some others in Europe were faced with what were in effect structural trade deficits. Those deficits – an excess of imports over exports – amounted to a continuing drag on demand. So in order to ensure that total demand – domestic demand minus the trade deficit – matched the capacity of their economies to produce, central banks in the deficit countries cut their official interest rates in order to boost domestic demand. That created an imbalance within those countries with spending too high relative to current and prospective incomes. In countries with trade surpluses such as China and Germany, spending was too low relative to likely future incomes [so they did the same – Ed.]. And the imbalance between countries – large trade surpluses and deficits – continued.\nAll this reinforced the determination of central banks to maintain extraordinarily low interest rates. Monetary stimulus via low interest rates works largely by giving incentives to bring forward spending from the future to the present. But this is a short-term effect. After a time tomorrow becomes today. Then we have to repeat the exercise and bring forward spending from the new tomorrow to the new today. As time passes we will be digging larger and larger holes in future demand. The result is a self-reinforcing path of weak growth in the economy. What started as an intentional savings glut has become a major disequilibrium in the world economy. This creates an enormous challenge for monetary policy. Central banks are, in effect, like cyclists pedalling up an ever steeper hill. They have to inject more and more monetary stimulus in order to maintain the same rate of growth of aggregate spending.\nBefore the crisis, many thought that the Great Stability could continue indefinitely and failed to understand that it could not. Their credulity was understandable. After all, GDP as a whole was evolving on a steady path, with growth around historical average rates, and low and stable inflation. But the imbalance in the pattern of spending and saving was far from sustainable, and was leading to the build-up of large stocks of debts. Bad investments were made, encouraged by low real interest rates. The crisis revealed that much of that misplaced investment – residential housing in the United States, Ireland and Spain; commercial property in Britain- was unprofitable, producing losses for borrowers and lenders alike. The impact of the crisis was to make debtors and creditors – households, companies and governments – uncomfortably aware that their previous spending paths had been based on unrealistic assessments of future long-term incomes. So they reduced spending. And central banks then had to cut interest rates yet again to bring more spending forward from the future to the present, and to create more money by purchasing large quantities of assets from the private sector – the practice known as unconventional monetary policy or quantitative easing (QE). There is in fact nothing unconventional about such a practice – so-called QE was long regarded as a standard tool of monetary policy – but the scale on which it has been implemented is unprecedented. Even so, it has become more and more difficult to persuade households and businesses to bring forward once again from an even bleaker future. After a point, monetary policy confronts diminishing returns. We have reached that point.”\nIn other words the imbalances have not gone away. He could have added that we will see a massive increase in unemployment if we cannot eliminate the trade deficit, and that Brexit provides the only opportunity to do so. Indeed we are not just talking about trade imbalances but also about fiscal deficits and unrepayable national debts, as well as the low interest rate, low growth scenario itself. An increase in interest rates would encourage savings which would flow into investments and new technology, thereby increasing productivity and economic growth, but this won’t happen until the imbalances are eradicated. It’s not that the new technology is not there; just that it is not being used. In addition there are also severe imbalances in some particular markets within the UK, such as housing, steel and executive salaries, which also pose a threat to future growth and stability.\nAfter reading such an interesting account of the problems we face, including Lord King’s ideas on the future of bank regulation – an approach he calls the “Pawnbroker for All Seasons”, being a continuous replacement for the crisis-driven “Lender of Last Resort” policy first described by Walter Bagehot – I have to say I came down with a bump during his last chapter, entitled “The Audacity of Pessimism”. It is here he gives his prescription for dealing with these outstanding economic challenges. He has three recommendations, and I add my comments against each one as follows:-\n(1) To enhance productivity in all ways possible. Comment: All in favour of course, but surely all countries around the world will be doing exactly the same thing, so the chances of the UK or other deficit countries stealing a permanent structural march on all the others seem most unlikely to me.\n(2) To extend free trade wherever possible, including TTIP. Comment: See above – surely a series of balanced trade deals will leave the opening imbalances unchanged or even magnified. This after all is why the Doha round collapsed.\n(3) Return to freely floating exchange rates. Comment: I assume he is referring to an end to the eurozone here. And the best of luck with that one M’Lud! Can’t see it happening myself, and anyway it is not within our gift, though I appreciate he is stressing the need for action at international level to avoid what he calls the prisoner’s dilemma.\nSo what is my prescription then? I offer the following ten recommendations, many of which the UK can pursue unilaterally:-\n(1) To set up a UK Sovereign Wealth Fund while interest rates are still on the floor to hedge our national debt, future unfunded pension liabilities and urgent infrastructure improvements. Regular readers will know I have recommended this idea on numerous occasions, for example under my post on Pensions, but the particular relevance here is that\n(a) The investment of a large part of this fund overseas will make the pound more competitive,\n(b) The building up of the fund will increase the national savings rate, and hence investment and economic growth,\n(c) The knowledge that the debt is ultimately covered means we can take a much more flexible and cyclical approach to the fiscal deficit today, concentrating on recovery now and leaving austerity until the recovery has accelerated too far.\n(2) To take advantage of Brexit to set up maximum import tariffs for the UK to minimise our own trade deficit thereby enabling us the start raising interest rates and economic growth, and to help finance our fiscal deficit (again, see above).\n(3) To pursue internationally a global import tariff regime designed to counter global trade imbalances (see my earlier post on Greece, the Eurozone and World Trade). The maximum tariff rates would be set for each country by the WTO in relation both to the size of their trade deficits and to the size of any defaulted sovereign foreign currency debt (see next). Also encourage a global corporation tax regime whereby tax is levied on global profits apportioned to national/global turnover. Only the profits would be reallocated centrally, leaving each country to apply it’s own rate of tax. Start in the UK anyway!\n(4) To allow internationally insolvent countries to carry forward their defaulted debt on an interest-free basis. To haircut capital balances on the other hand would surely lead to contagion across the whole banking system. Such debts would have priory for repayment if and when the country returned to trade surplus.\n(5) Rigorously control our borders so that businesses can no longer take the easy way out by importing cheap staff instead of training up our school leavers or investing in new technology. It will also end wage compression which was such a significant factor in the vote to leave the EU. Our objective must be balanced migration and well as balanced trade. Both are only available through Brexit. Richard Baldwin (see above) opines that controlling our borders will not stop firms from off-shoring, and that is probably true. But unless we do so we cannot stimulate demand and reduce unemployment through traditional Keynesian fiscal and monetary policies, as instead they will only suck in more immigrants. This is indeed is very apparent from current statistics; the indigenous unemployed are not benefiting. Keynes tells us that a balanced economy will create exactly the right number of jobs to meet the requirements of new entrants to the labour market. The fact that we are apparently now dependent on immigration is simply a reflection of these imbalances, including skills and regional imbalances, and over-stimulation of the economy as a result of political pressures.\n(6) Set up a portfolio of Local Community Banks across the UK, either in the ownership of the Bank of England or allow independently, along the lines of the “Bank of Dave” in Bolton and those in Germany, to engage purely in taking in local medium to long-term deposits and lending to local businesses. It seems to me such banks could easily meet Lord King’s “Pawnbroker for All Seasons” test whereby effective liquid assets must always exceed effective liquid liabilities, and the effect, particularly in areas of higher unemployment, would help to reduce the regional disparities which were also a significant factor in the vote the leave the EU.\n(7) Complete welfare reform along the lines set out in my earlier post here in order really to make work pay. The previous government introduced all sorts of sticks but no carrots. We need both, including a big increase in the UC earnings disregards in place of the duplicate tax credits system. Also introduce a separate self-assessed benefit for the self-employed which would only be continued on receipt of a monthly return of hours worked and income. Over-claims would attract a high rate of interest. This will give us a better indication of underemployment in this growing sector of the labour market and therefore a better indication of where we are in the economic cycle.\n(8) Quarantine those UK markets which are themselves in disequilibrium, ie\n(a) The housing market. Introduce macro prudential measures to limit the availability of mortgage finance so as to hold house prices level, or even slightly declining, post-code by post-code across the country. As well as creating stability this would\n(i) provide an additional string to the bow of regional policy,\n(ii) remove the expectation of property gains whereby the rich get richer by doing nothing,\n(iii) reduce the danger of repossessions,\n(iv) encourage property developers to build on and sell their land banks.\n(b) The steel industry. Set tariff levels so that imports are no greater than the excess of domestic demand over 90% of domestic supply. Promote competition within the UK steel industry but limit profits with a cap, and restrict pay increases to those necessary to prevent a rise in staff turnover rates.\n(c) Executive and professional employee pay. Introduce Cheapest Competent Candidate procedures, starting with the public sector and then by inclusion into company law. Also consider the introduction of Supervisory Boards for all public companies, comprising perhaps the six largest shareholders, three executives and the chairman, to ensure a shareholder veto over this and other strategic decisions. See this earlier post.\n(9) Regional policy. Introduce a second personal allowance into the income tax system so that those living in areas of higher unemployment pay less tax on any given income that those living in areas of low unemployment. Adjust as you go along to achieve an even and stable level of percentage employment across the country. See this earlier post.\n(10) Introduce a National Credit Card so that all citizens can choose between the public and private sectors for their ‘public’ services, both effectively free at the point of delivery, but with the latter on a means test applied after the event via the tax system. This can be introduced gradually by varying the means test gradient as supply rises to meet demand in the private sector, and will consequently both reduce the burden on the taxpayer and improve the efficiency and quality of the services provided in both sectors though competition. Working capital at 5% can be provided by the Sovereign Wealth Fund. See this earlier post.\nIn many respects a successful hard Brexit is very like victory at El Alamein, of which Churchill famously said “This is not the end of the war. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it may just be the end of the beginning”. Brexit merely provides the opportunity to avoid Armageddon. There will follow several years of hard graft before we can secure balanced trade and migration, during which we shall have to hold back on growth to prevent inflation. Let us never forget that the establishment almost entirely backed Halifax for Prime Minister in 1940. The Remainians won’t go quietly, but we shall fight them at the polls, we shall fight them in the press and in the media. We shall never give up!",
  "https_jepoynton_com_/https_jepoynton_com_2022_12_08_2021-bop-update-graphs/content_5.html": "On 31st October the ONS published a breakdown by country of our balance of payments for 2021 so I have updated the graphs I do each year to show how our trade with the EU is developing.\nWe are now facing opinion polls showing a majority in favour of re-joining the European Union. How could this have happened?\nSome Labour MPs, LibDems and Rejoiners think it is to do with labour shortages. They mistakenly associate tighter immigration with Brexit. But Brexit merely allows us to determine our own immigration policy, and that can be for more immigration if we so wish. So immigration now has nothing to do with Brexit. That shouldn’t be too difficult to get across but we have to make the point.\nMore seriously they associate Britain’s economic decline to Brexit. This is also nonsense as the above graphs illustrate.\nThe first graph shows our Balance of Payments (mostly trade) from the years 2000 to 2021, split between the EU (red line plummeting down through the floor) and the rest of the world (which I have split into three to show the US and China separately for comparison). Note that those other three lines taken together show a movement over that period into surplus. So at least until 2018 we have a divergence between the two areas – the EU and the Rest of the World.\nHow come? It can’t be us because we are common to both. It has to be Brussels. My theory (in the absence of any other explanation) is that since 2000 Brussels has be deliberately though surreptitiously blocking our exports in revenge for our not joining the Euro. The thieving bastards have been stealing our trade, and our dozy officials in Whitehall haven’t even noticed (or didn’t want to, which is even worse).\nIs this important? Well yes it is because an increasing deficit presents British business with a contracting market, and business will not invest into a contracting market. No investment, no growth. It is the greater efficiency of production resulting from investment that creates economic growth. Tax cuts may help, but the opportunities to invest must be there in the first place.\nThis analysis is confirmed by the second graph which shows our growth rate plummeting alongside the EU trade deficit. The productivity gap is no mystery. It is a direct consequence of the increasing trade deficit with the EU, and explains why other countries are not experiencing it.\nSO THE ONLY WAY WE CAN GET GROWTH GOING AGAIN IS BY RIPPING UP THE TORY DEAL AND USING TARIFFS TO OFFSET THE EU BARRIERS AND BRING THE BALANCE BACK INTO SURPLUS. ONLY UKIP IS SAYING THIS SO ONLY UKIP CAN GET THE ECONOMY GOING AGAIN.\nOf course exporters will squeal if they have to face EU tariffs, but the uncomfortable fact for them is that our domestic market is far larger than our trade with the EU. Tariffs will reduce the volume of trade in each direction across the channel, but because we have a deficit the deficit will reduce as well. This means people in the UK will be buying more British stuff and less EU stuff. That presents British business with an expanding market to invest into thus generating investment and economic growth. So whilst those in exporting might struggle, those supplying the domestic market will have a bonanza – an import-substution led expansion.\nEven better we can in fact protect our exports to the EU from tariffs, though not against the non-tariff barriers already there. This is because the new UK import tariff revenues will be much greater than the cost of the EU tariffs on our smaller volume of exports, so we can cross-fund them. It would be interesting in fact to start right now promising our EU customers a refund on any excess charges they are paying on British imports so we can confront Brussels with them. Doing so is entirely legal under WTO rules.\nLooking at the past two years however we see that the deficit has reversed and it is tempting to say that is the Brexit Dividend! However It is much more likely to be due to Covid, but we will have to wait and see over the next couple of years. At least we can say it shows the current mess is NOT due to Brexit.\nJohn Poynton.

  "https_jepoynton_com_/https_jepoynton_com_2020_08_29_addressing-islam-and-racism/content_14.html": "UKIP’s constitution under Clause 2.4 says clearly that we uphold the principles of Equality under the Law and oppose all forms of discrimination. It follows from this that it would be wrong to mention Islam specifically in any manifesto, at least as far as proposed changes to the law are concerned, because if the law identifies any person or group then automatically that person or group is no longer equal under the law. A number of members who have left us have found that difficult to reconcile.\nThe issues we face are those of criminality and cultural displacement, not Islam as such. I see no reason to enquire into the nature of Islam. I have never read the Koran as it is not my religion. I am a libertarian believing in freedom of conscience and worship. A problem only arises if the law is broken. The law is binary. Either you are Guilty or you are Not Guilty. There is nothing in between. Motivation is irrelevant as far as the verdict is concerned. It may be taken into account in the sentencing, but that is another matter. The fact that some individuals do not respect the law and want to substitute their own need not concern us at the level of an individual crime. It does concern us however if such individuals attain political power and influence in large numbers. It also concerns us if the indigenous population start to feel pushed aside and ignored either physically or politically. That is what I call cultural displacement. Nobody minds a bit of diversity and I support those who say it enriches our own civilisation, but when the numbers become as large as they are now it ceases to be diversity and becomes displacement.\nThose who protest at this are often accused of Islamophobia. It seems to be an exclusively Islamic problem. We don’t have the same problem with Judaism of Sikhism for example as they make an effort to fit in and adopt our values, and we have benefited greatly from their contributions.\nPhobia simply means fear. Machiavelli noted that if you hurt a man he will hate you for it, and all the others will fear you for it. He was of course advocating fear as an instrument of policy, whereas we want exactly the opposite. But his understanding of human nature was spot on. Of course if someone comes along and tries to kill us or rape our daughters we are going to hate them for it. And everyone else will fear them for it. What else did they expect! Fear is irrational and will not draw nice distinctions between good moslems and bad. Aggression is always and only a sign of insecurity. Insecure people will lash out indiscriminately, and that will then create fear on the other side, and before you know it a viscous circle has flared up and you have a civil war on your hands.\nIf you want to reduce an effect then you must reduce the cause, and the principle causes of racism and Islamophobia in this country today are perceived inequality under the law and cultural displacement. To paraphrase Tony Blair’s famous dictum about crime, we must not only be tough on racism, we must also be tough on the causes of racism.\nCanvassing around Southall now during two general elections, a majority black and Asian community with a large number of different ethnic groups and the largest Sikh community outside India, I was struck by how almost all of them said it was natural for each to self-segregate. I don’t have a problem with this, provided always that no group becomes disproportionately dependent on the state. I certainly don’t agree with those who want to whiz everyone up into some sort of homogeneous, mono-cultural mulligatawny soup. On that basis we should object to the Welsh speaking Welsh! We all want to preserve and celebrate our own cultures, and that is the glory of multiculturalism. Long may it survive. It only becomes a problem if one group becomes over-assertive and insists on shoving their own identity up the noses of others. Gay Pride marches routed through Muslim neighbourhoods provide an entertaining example! Muslim ethnic cleansing and grooming gangs a much more serious one.\nHowever the result is the formation of something akin to geological tectonic plates. When one plate expands and starts to overlap another you get earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, in this case in the form of conflict and racism. I understand the dilemma that local authorities find themselves in when faced with the need to accommodate increasing and changing numbers like this, but their attempts to mix everyone up simply does not work. The result is the ethnic cleansing gangs that we have seen in Luton and elsewhere which intimidate all others out of the areas they themselves want to live in, and the police, under orders from the local authority, simply stand by and do nothing.\nThe only real answer is to control the ethnic balance and numbers with strict control over immigration and by ending breeding for benefits. I address those policies elsewhere. In addition we must review the lines of accountability of the police so that enforcement of national laws are not overlooked. The appointment of a national Chief of Police to provide a clear line of accountability and responsibility between local constabularies and Parliament would be a start. It would also help ensure the police get the resources they need, and that the performance of each constabulary is reviewed in comparison with its peers. And it would enable a secondary line for public complaint to a national review team for instances where local constabularies fail to follow up on local complaints or, even worse, start to persecute those who complain, as has been witnessed now on several occasions.",
  "https_jepoynton_com_/https_jepoynton_com_page_3/content_18.html": "Delighted to have been reselected to fight the Ealing Southall constituency for UKIP, and have already received warm greetings on many a doorstep. You can download here both my election leaflet and postal election address. The former was really designed in anticipation of the 2018 local elections and was just about to go for printing when the election was announced, so I just added a banner at the top. The latter only gives me a few words to add to a central office designed template, but I hope I have got the essence of the situation across.\nHere though is a much fuller Election Address. In addition there is a shorter hustings address thereafter.\n“I should like to talk about two issues this evening. First there is the absolute Horlicks of a start Theresa May has made to her Brexit negotiations. At this rate she will end up with a bummer of a deal with the EU, claim it is the best thing since sliced bread, and then ram it through Parliament on the back of her temporary blip majority. We could then be stuck with it, which would be an absolute betrayal of all those who voted to LEAVE in the referendum. So what can we do about it, if anything?\nSecond I want to talk about funding so we can end austerity and at the same time resuscitate our public services to the standard we all want and expect. I will show you how UKIP, using our libertarian principles, could raise £150 billion pounds of new money without frightening the horses.\nBut first of all, why am I here at all? Why is UKIP still here? After all we won the referendum so surely that is job done for UKIP and we can now all quietly retire?\nUnfortunately it is much more complicated than that. As I have already mentioned, Brexit in an acceptable form is still far from certain. For us this election is about votes, not seats. Last time we chalked up over 4 million votes and that made an impact. If we can do better this time, which will be a tall order as we are standing down in a number of seats for strategic reasons, putting country before party, we can make an even bigger impact. UKIP is the only pro-Brexit party that can mount a constructive Opposition. The others will of course mount destructive ones, but that is not what we want. So your vote for UKIP will count. A vote for any other candidate in this safe seat will not make a jot of difference. It will be a wasted vote.\nSo what about Theresa May? One of the biggest differences between the Tory version of Brexit and UKIP’s relates to trade. The Tory’s want a trade deal with the EU whereas we have always said we do not. There are three good reasons for this. First, if you plonk a trade deal on top of an existing deficit, you are only going to increase that deficit. That’s just simple mathematics. If imports and exports both rise by roughly the same percentage, which is after all the object of the exercise, then the deficit will rise by the same percentage. What on earth is the point of doing that? It will only increase unemployment.\nSecond, it is critical we eliminate our deficit if we want to avoid a new financial crisis. At present we depend on Quantitative Easing to make good the loss of consumer demand from the deficit. However QE not only undermines our ability to save, it also cannot carry on for much longer. QE works by reducing interest rates, thereby encouraging people to borrow their future earnings to spend today. But inevitably tomorrow will soon become today and, oh dear; we have already spent our income. Not only that, we still have a hole in our economic barrel and we now have to start repaying the money we borrowed yesterday. It just won’t add up. The only way we can avoid Armageddon is to eliminate the deficit, and the only way of doing that is by devaluation and import tariffs, policies which are only available from a no-deal Brexit.\nThird, if we leave without a trade deal then of course we will put in place an import tariff regime of our own; probably a mirror image of the one we are leaving, the EU one. I don’t know why nobody ever talks about this – it’s weird! Maybe it is because I am an accountant that I pick up on it, but if we did that it would be worth an extra £25bn a year to the Treasury. That’s huge. Yet by pursuing a trade deal, egged on by all those free trade fanatics baying in the background, she is proposing to throw that money away for nothing. How crazy is that? Surely no one in their right minds would do that? But no, that is the way she is going. At this rate she is set to drop us all in the biggest pile of poo ever produced by Woman.\nDisastrously Theresa May started her negotiations by declaring openly that she wanted a trade deal. Michel Barnier must have smacked his lips with glee. “She wants something, so let’s make her pay!” he will have said to himself. And so he did, slamming on a €100bn ransom demand. That’s a ludicrous sum of money and he knows it, but probably thought of it as a negotiating anchor to be given back in stages for other goodies along the way. Unfortunately he is instead stuck with it because the other 27 countries have smelt the money and they are not now going to give it up. Barnier is a professional negotiator, whereas Theresa May clearly hasn’t a clue what she is doing. It’s no good being ‘tough and difficult’ if you don’t know what you are doing. That just makes her ‘stubborn and stupid’. We MUST divert her from this course, and that’s why a big vote for UKIP nationally is so important. I am even coming round to the LibDems idea of a second referendum. Not on membership but on the “Deal or No Deal” decision. We have trusted the people once, we can do so again. It may be the only way we can pull the plug on a disastrous deal.\nOK. Let’s move on to funding. If we are to end austerity we have to find £70bn just to do that. Then to rebuild our public services we would need at least another £30bn, making a total of £100bn, or more safely let’s say £80bn, ie a total of £150bn. Is that possible? Well, consider this.\nAs I have just noted, the immediate fiscal benefit of leaving the EU is not just the £10bn saving on budget payments but also the import tariff revenues, giving a total benefit of £35bn. That’s about 2% of GDP. A lot of money and far more than any of the other parties can produce, but unfortunately not as much as the deficit. So what’s next?\nCorporation Tax on multinationals. You may remember that at the Enniskillen G8 Summit a few years ago it was agreed that multinationals should declare their global profits. This would enable us to tax them on those profits so they could not squirrel them away in tax havens. The WTO was supposed to be working on a system whereby they would centrally assess the taxable profit of these multinationals and then apportion them to each nation in proportion to turnover so that those countries could then apply their own tax rates to them. It’s all gone a bit quiet, but if the WTO does deliver this system it could be worth about another £15bn of tax to the UK. Even if they don’t we can still do it unilaterally. There may be a few double tax issues, but we can just direct those to the WTO! So let’s add it on, total £50bn so far.\nNow let’s get philosophical. UKIP is a libertarian party. Freedom of Conscience, Freedom of Expression, Freedom of Choice and Freedom for Britain are the four founding principles upon which the party is built. In this context that means giving people the opportunity to buy their ‘public’ services from the private sector if they want to on a means-tested basis rather than from the public sector. Roughly £400bn is spent on such services, ie health, education, care for the elderly and so on, so if about a quarter of people chose to do this, and on average contributed about a quarter of the cost as their means-tested payments, that would save a further £25bn. So now we are up to £75bn and ahead of the deficit!\nI think it quite likely a significant number of people would do this, depending on the exact means-test gradient which we can alter as need be. After all private sector services are likely to be much more efficient, much more accessible and be provided to a much higher standard. That is because they are in an open competitive market, whereas the public sector is a monopoly and all monopolies profiteer. What is austerity after all but a form of profiteering? People will be prepared to pay for that.\nFurthermore we could end the privilege tag that burdens our independent schools by simply means-testing their fees. That way any parent no matter how poor could consider an independent school education for their child. Our independent schools are among the best in the world, so much so that now around 25% of their pupils come from overseas, which is a huge export earner. But isn’t it a tragedy that more British children cannot benefit from them. Labour’s vindictive, pernicious and envious attacks on them have backfired making them even more privileged than before. It’s time we cherished and championed our independent schools and removed these burdens in return for a means-tested fee regime.\nUKIP also supports grammar schools and free schools, and rightly so if that’s what parents want. Let us never forget that in a free society parents are ultimately responsible for their children, not the state. The state is there to support parents, not to replace them. However we also have a major problem in educating our least able and least focused children. These children need much more attention, smaller class sizes, better trained teachers, more pastoral care etc. etc. which all costs money. We should therefore be aiming to allocate more money per child to these children than to the brighter ones else we will be generating an underclass to the detriment of us all. Streaming allows you to charge means-tested fees for the faster streams and use that money for the slower ones without undermining social mobility.\nWhat’s next? Privatising infrastructure projects, that’s what. HS2, Crossrail, power stations, bridges, tunnels etc are all costing the taxpayer a fortune. Furthermore many of them are probably uneconomic thereby undermining our economic growth rate rather than adding to it. You will never get an objective viability assessment from politicians or civil servants; there are too many hidden agendas in the background, whereas someone who is putting their own money in a competitive bid will surely do so. The long term or monopoly ones can be protected by cap and collar profit regulation to the benefit of both investor and taxpayer. So let’s put these projects up for auction, after the spec has been approved by Parliament, and award them to the higher bidder to build, run and own them. Let the City pay for them if they are viable, and if they are not: don’t do them! It’s a bit finger in the air, but I think we are reasonably safe putting in £25bn a year for this, giving a total now of £100bn.\nResource Management in our public services is next. There isn’t any. I know we all complain about the number of middle managers in the NHS and so on, but there is nothing at the top. For example if you look at the board of NHS England (yes I know it is a separate quango employing about 4000 staff, but it’s the nearest thing the NHS can manage) it is full of medics and civil servants. There is no Human Resources director, no Finance director, no IT director, no Facilities director and so on. In fact there are none of the resource focused directorships that you would see on the board of a private sector conglomerate. No wonder we are not training sufficient doctors and nurses and have to import so many from overseas. No wonder staff turnover rates are so high. What we need is the technique Arnold Weinstock perfected at GEC during the 60s, 70s and 80s. It’s not top-down management. In fact is localism management. I call it ‘Comparative Management by Results’. If we could just get a 5% improvement in efficiency on the £400bn we spend that would be worth another £20bn.\nAnd finally – a Sovereign Wealth Fund. Now I don’t wish to speak ill of the politically dead, but surely George Osborne must count as one of the deadest of dead sheep ever to have inhabited the Treasury (if that isn’t a contradiction in terms!). I always got the impression he wasn’t even interested in his subject. I know Gordon Brown was a disaster, but at least he tried and came up with initiatives. Whereas as Osborne missed an absolute sitter right under his nose; using the fact that interest rates were on the floor to set up a Sovereign Wealth Fund to hedge our National Debt and un-funded pension liabilities, as well as in the long term to fund our public services out of investment income rather than taxes. Work though the figures and you will see it is money for old rope! Furthermore we can to some extent discount the future revenue stream to fund a current ongoing deficit. I am going to put in £30bn for that, and there’s my £150bn! I rest my case. Thank you very much.”\nAnd now for the hustings address:\n“Good evening L&G, and first may I say how pleased I am to be here at last. In 2015 I had to miss this hustings due to a prior engagement, so I hope you didn’t think I was avoiding you! Far from it, because may I also say how much I have enjoyed canvassing around Southall. You have been friendly, open-minded, curious, receptive and engaging, and that surely is all we candidates can ask of you. So thank you also for that.\nNow I don’t want to spend the whole evening banging on about Brexit, but if you are interested in the technical arguments, about trade in particular, you can find them in my full Election Address, which is on our branch website at ukipealing.com. It is also on the Democracy Club website and on my own website at jepoynton.com.\nI thought however it would be interesting just to reflect for a moment on the sudden fall in the expected Tory majority, and why that has happened. Some say it is because of Theresa May’s U-turns on social care and winter fuel payments, but I doubt it. They only affected the rich, and Labour are all in favour of taxing the rich, so where’s the difference?\nNo, I think it is because the British public have sensed she has already made a complete car-crash of these Brexit negotiations. By demanding a trade deal with the EU, up front, she has played straight into Michel Barnier’s hands. He has responded by demanding an enormous ransom of €100 billion – an impossible sum. She didn’t have to do that, and is now trying to wriggle out of it by saying that no deal is better than a bad deal. But we could have had a deal on non-trade issues anyway, because the EU wanted to deal with those first, and that would have suited us just fine because we could then simply have left at half-time. Now not even that option is available.\nThe odd thing though is that people have rushed to the opposite extreme, like lemmings over a cliff, straight into the lap of Labour. Do people really think Jeremy Corbyn could do better? Honestly, this is a man who cannot even add up, let alone negotiate. It would be a case of out the frying pan and into the fire. UKIP invented Brexit, we fought for it, we secured the referendum, we understand it. It’s our baby. So please, I beg of you, for everyone’s sake, let us deliver it.\nBut enough of Brexit already! What I really want to concentrate on this evening is “Beyond Brexit”. UKIP is a Libertarian party. Indeed so far as I can see it is the only libertarian party on the British political stage. The two main parties, Tories and Labour, are partisan and confrontational; still busily fighting the class wars of the early twentieth century, like a couple of Don Quixote’s tilting at windmills.\nSo what exactly do I mean by Libertarian? I could talk about Freedom of Conscience. I could talk about Freedom of Expression, or Freedom of Choice, and of course of Freedom for Britain. But as is so often the case the best definition comes from considering the opposite, and for that I can do no better than John Stuart Mill’s famous dictum about the Tyranny of the Majority. That simply means that in a democratic society it is not acceptable for the majority to decide everything, because that leaves no room for minority rights or individual responsibility – for true diversity if you like.\nWe had a classic example of the Tyranny of the Majority a few years ago when a Labour government closed down Catholic adoption agencies. They were doing a great job and harming no one, but because they were serving only the Catholic community they had to go. They simply did not fit with Labour’s socialist totalitarian straight-jacket ideology. Here in Southall you have a number of Free Schools. They likewise would not survive a Labour Government. Labour hates diversity and freedom of choice. All schools have to be comprehensive schools, so Grammar Schools, Free Schools and Independent schools are all in their firing line. To us, parents are ultimately responsible for their children, not the State. The State is there to support parents, not to replace them.\nThey talk about abolishing privilege, and I get that. But you know there is a much simpler way of doing it. Simply means-test independent school fees. That way any parent, no matter how poor, could consider an independent or grammar school education for their child and at the same time the cost to the Treasury is reduced so more can be spent on the slower stream schools, which is where it is really needed. Our independent schools are amongst the best in the world. 25% of their pupils now come from overseas. And UKIP’s immigration policies would not affect that at all. We are not concerned about temporary comings and goings. It is permanent settlement and citizenship which is the problem. But what a tragedy that more British children cannot now attend these schools. Labour’s vindictive, pernicious, jealous and small-minded policies have actually increased the privilege rather than reduce it! And now they want to add VAT as well.\nBut let me broaden the picture. Why shouldn’t all our non-security public services be available from the private sector on a means-tested basis? That would be real freedom of choice. It would not only ensure that the supply of services, such as care for the elderly, kept up with demand in an efficient manner, it would also reduce the pressure on our existing publicly owned services, thereby enabling them to do a better job. It is after all the purchase decision in an open competitive market that drives efficiency and drives quality of service, and that is why I believe a significant proportion of the population would chose the private sector even thought they would have to pay something affordable for it. That could save the state some £25bn a year whilst at the same time improving services. People talk about the private sector profiteering, but it is monopolies that profiteer, whoever owns them. After all, what is austerity if not profiteering? The public sector is by far the worst offender.\nIn summary I am asking you to vote UKIP at this election not only to rescue Brexit but also to share with me my vision for a truly libertarian future for our country. For us this election about votes, not seats. Last time we polled over 4 million votes. That had an impact. If we can repeat that or improve on it this time it will again have an impact. So a vote for UKIP will count and be significant.”",
  "https_jepoynton_com_/https_jepoynton_com_2015_07_31_the-banking-crisis-and-executive-pay/content_53.html": "Four separate factors came together to create the perfect storm that was the banking crisis. Two of these, the subprime housing collapse in the US and the haircutting of Greek sovereign debt (another catastrophic EU decision), both of which caused contagion to spread across the global banking system, were factors beyond the control of any British government. The other two, namely the failure of UK banking regulation and the build up of national debt, were. Strictly speaking the size of the national debt and deficit did not cause the recession, but it meant that the Coalition had to spend two years reducing the deficit before they could start reducing unemployment.\nThere has, I think, been a lot of very muddled thinking over the banking crisis. It’s not the bail-outs that were the problem. The taxpayer will come out of these with nice fat profits (which would have been even bigger at RBS if Gordon Brown had taken convertible loan stock in the first instance, until he knew the full extent of the losses, rather than equity), and both depositors and creditors were protected as well. Only shareholders, which of course include you and me through our pension funds, lost out. The recession was caused by a combination of contagion and regulation failure (as the banks in retrospect pulled in their horns). Many of the measures taken by the Coalition, such as the bail-in procedures and the ‘electrified’ ring fence, appear to be designed to make it easier for banks to go bust rather than less, which means that any future recession will be even greater! Increasing bank equity ratio requirements in the middle of a recession can only make that recession deeper. It is also worth remembering that some of the bank failures, such as Northern Rock and HBoS, had nothing to do with sub-prime; they were just simple cases of over-trading, ie. regulation failure.\nOne small and rather technical point we could look at however would be to remove limited-liability status from retail bank subsidiaries. As I am sure you know, under company law the creditors of a bankrupt subsidiary company have no recourse to the holding company for restitution. Normally this encourages investment and economic growth, but in the case of retail banks security is more important. Such a change would place the group at first port of call for any bail out instead of the tax-payer, and create a more arms-length relationship preventing the group from treating its retail subsidiary as a cash cow for its rather more dodgy ‘casino’ activities.\nBut the real problem is the relationship between shareholders and directors, with the former losing money whilst the latter swan about playing ‘masters of the universe’ and paying themselves the earth to boot. The Coalition proposed yet more red tape to hold directors more directly responsible, but I suggest that such an interventionist approach may well backfire and undermine the status of the City. Instead I propose the introduction of Supervisory Boards for all publicly quoted companies (not just the banks), not to put Unions on them like the Germans do, but to comprise the five or six largest shareholders on the register when the meeting is called, together with perhaps a couple of non-execs and the Chairman and Chief Executive, so that the shareholders have the majority. Company law would give these boards authority over capital reconstructions, takeovers and mergers, and over the appointment and remuneration of the directors. Such an approach would enable the principal shareholders to be involved in these key decisions well before resolutions for general meetings are formulated, whereas the Coalition has merely given shareholders a slightly larger rubber stamp than they had before. Such a structural change would reflect the ownership of the company rather than have the government intervening with yet another raft of red tape.\nAll of which brings us to the subject of executive pay. What I see here is a closed shop, even more so today when everything is done behind closed doors by headhunters. As a capitalist I expect to see an open competitive market. We do not tolerate closed shops from the Unions, so why should we do so from company executives? It is not in the public interest, nor is it conducive to economic growth. Headhunters and directors like to say that there are only a few people who can run these large companies, yet a moment’s observation shows that they are no different to our armed forces, where it has become a cliché to say that you end up with more admirals than there are ships and generals that there are tanks. These large pyramidal organisations all recruit well, train well and promote well, so that you end up with a great tsunami of talent surging up into the little pinnacle at the top with nowhere to go. They also like to say that there would be an exodus of executive talent abroad, but I just don’t buy this in view of the numbers available. Even if we do lose a few bed-blockers abroad, I welcome the emigration!\nI realise that recruitment is a risky business, and it is natural for headhunters to want to cover their backsides by limiting their shortlists only to people who have done exactly the same job in exactly the same industry somewhere else before and then just moving them sideways. Obviously you will find only a few who fit that gold-plated requirement, who can and then do ask for any salary they want, setting off a chain of catch-up increases across the industry, but it is a false analysis. Some years ago research in the US compared the performance of CEOs who were doing the job for the first time with those who had been moved sideways by headhunters, and found that almost invariably the first timers did a better job.\nThe solution is a procedure I call Cheapest Competent Candidate. Recruiters would be forced to dip their toes rather deeper into the pool of talent and produce a minimum shortlist of five names. It could be included into company law as a default that the supervisory board could overturn on a temporary basis if they really wished, and could also provide for the award of discretionary discounts to candidates of up to say 10%. Essentially however the process is then simply to ask the candidates to bid for the job, and to appoint the lowest net bidder, just as you would do with a contractor.",
  "https_jepoynton_com_/https_jepoynton_com_author_jepoynton_page_4/content_72.html": "The almost universally held and unquestioned belief in free trade, that is trade unhindered by either blockade or tariffs, is generally attributed to the classical economist David Ricardo, who included a chapter on Foreign Trade in his famous book The Principles of Political Economy and Taxation published in 1817. The modern mantra holds that free trade drives investment, productivity and economic growth through increased competition from imports.\nAllowing for the fact that Ricardo was writing before modern terms such as ‘value added’, ‘productivity’, ‘money supply’ or ‘GDP’ were introduced, he in fact makes no mention of this effect at all! His only mention of productivity comes when he is examining the effect on the economies of two countries engaged in balanced trade when one finds a more efficient method of production. The result is a trade surplus by that country resulting in an increased money supply, which in turn creates inflation, which in turn rebalances the trade by attracting more imports. In his argument the productivity increase is the cause of increased competition, not the result of it. He also notes the benefits of specialisation, where different countries have different natural advantages in the production of certain goods, but makes no suggestion that these advantages are anything other than fixed. That is all.\nRicardo wrote at a time when most money was fixed in the form of precious metals and thus before the advent of floating exchange rates and mega currency capital flows. His arguments preclude the possibility of the sort of structural trade imbalances we see today.\nOf course there are numerous papers to be found on the internet and elsewhere arguing that free trade enhances economic growth. Invariably the writer will point to periods of economic growth, such as the post-war decades or the decade following the exit from the ERM, and notes the coincidence with an expansion in free trade. Closer inspection however reveals plenty of alternative possible causes, such as peace, reconstruction, stability and devaluation. So the logic is by no means conclusive.\nI am well aware also of the classical arguments around specialisation and economies of scale. However these have now been superseded by globalisation and the advent of off-shoring. Richard Baldwin, author of “The Great Convergence: Information Technology and the New Globalisation”, gives the example of the Canadian company Bombardier that transferred the production of aircraft tails from Quebec to Mexico. He says “The ICT revolution made it feasible for rich-nation firms to leverage their knowledge with low-wage workers abroad. Bombardier can now use its know-how to make aircraft tails with Mexican manufacturing engineers who only get $60 a day instead of Canadian engineers on $35 an hour. The ability of, for example, Canadian firms to take their knowledge elsewhere means that what is good for Bombardier may not be good for Canada.” He could have added that these multinational companies also off-shore their profits, so their host nations no longer even get a share of those profits though tax.\nA related perspective comes from Mariana Mazzucato, author of “The Entrepreneurial State”, who gives a detailed account of how almost all the significant technological breakthroughs of the last seventy years, including the internet, Microsoft’s Windows, Apple’s smart-phones and Google’s search algorithm to name but a few, have their genesis in state-funded research. The private sector only became involved when the uncertainties were considerably reduced, and venture capitalists when the product was almost ready to bring to market. They then made billions for themselves from IPO’s and share buy-backs, all off-shored or reduced by favourable capital gains tax regimes negotiated on the bogus claim that they are taking the enormous risks necessary to promote innovation. The result has been that none of those profits were either returned to the state or reinvested in new research.\nWhat we are seeing now is not so much the creation of new wealth but a massive transfer of existing wealth to third world countries as a result of globalisation and unbalanced free trade. Of course it is wonderful that we can now anticipate the ending of global food poverty by 2030, but let us not kid ourselves that most of this is not at the expense of the first-world working classes. The “I’m all right, Jack” Remainian middle-class establishment has of course protected itself with a widening pay gap, leaving the burden to be carried just by the lower income groups, and they are now fed up with both the burden and the injustice of it.\nNow it is not my purpose to offer conclusive evidence or the results of research but, like the established view, rely on logic and what stands to reason. The disadvantage is that logic alone does not give any measure of the factors examined. For example, it would be logical to suppose that the law of diminishing returns applies to the competitive benefits of each 1% marginal increase in imports. With UK imports running at close on 35% of GDP it would be reasonable to assume that any competitive effect comes from the established 35% rather than from any marginal increase. It might also be reasonable to conclude that the effects of specialisation are also much diminished anyway given that most countries are now industrialising and that even England can produce wine! Any given new free trade agreement is likely to have only a one-off step benefit rather than provide the ongoing growth such as we get from innovation.\nSo my purpose rather is to examine whether such benefits are greater or less than the damage caused by structural trade deficits, and consequently our policy towards the use of import tariffs. This issue is of critical importance at present for three reasons:\n(1) it affects our approach to negotiating our disengagement from the EU, and\n(2) it affects how we tackle the outstanding imbalances which still threaten world economic and banking stability.\n(3) it highlights the damage that free-trade fanaticism can cause.\nBrexit has given us the benefit of a 10% devaluation, which should go some way toward reducing our record trade deficit, now in excess of 5% of GDP. But devaluation will almost certainly not do the whole job. The danger is that Mrs. May’s government will not now impose the maximum trade tariffs on the EU’s exports to us. We will still have to pay around 4.3% on average in tariffs on our exports to them, which we can easily afford following the devaluation, so a balanced position maintaining the status quo demands we should charge the same to them. Failure to do so will not only worsen our deficit, it will also throw away some £25bn of potential import tariff revenues; money we desperately need to plug our fiscal deficit.\nEven suppose some free trade deal were to be agreed with the EU prior to the completion of the Article 50 transition period, and even suppose this were balanced in each sides’ interests, the result would be higher imports and exports but no reduction in the deficit and the loss of the tariff revenues. Indeed the deficit would increase in proportion. As we start with a deficit, any FTA will only make it worse – the very opposite of what we want. And of course in the short term any increase in imports destroys jobs just as rapidly as exports create them, so we would have thrown away the import tariff revenues for nothing.\nThe only way we could get any advantage out of an agreement with the EU would be if it were unbalanced in our favour. That’s most unlikely to happen, particularly in view of the EU’s desire to maintain free movement of peoples. In other words they want to skew it in their favour! Forget it, we will be better off without- the WTO option is the best option. And of course there is no prospect of any sort of new Napoleonic blockade. That would be illegal under WTO rules. All we are talking about here is tariffs. Interesting how the Remain camp use the term ‘access’ to the single market to imply a blockade! Much the same applies to the term ‘free movement of people’. The vast majority will be able to come and go with just a visa, probably obtainable online! The problem only arises if they overstay that visa, and with online identification of over-stayers that should be manageable too. The important line must be drawn at citizenship and permanent leave to remain.\nAt present the rest of the world pays these tariffs to Brussels, but after Brexit the danger is they would receive the benefit of a reduction in tariffs they pay with no counterbalancing advantage to the UK. That would be a disaster. If we charge the same tariffs and then simply divert them from Brussels to London the rest of the world will not notice any difference and we will gain the revenues. There is no sign that Mrs. May’s government understands this.\nBut this debate must considered in the light of the importance of eliminating our trade deficit; something we have given almost no priority to in the past. Lord King (previously Mervyn King, Governor of the Bank of England from 2003 to 2013) has just published a fascinating and very readable book entitled “The End of Alchemy“, in which he not only proposes a new approach to bank regulation but also traces the cause of both the banking crisis and our deterioration standards of living back to the massive global trade imbalances that developed after the fall of the Berlin Wall. He makes it very clear that we must take trade deficits far more seriously than we have done in the past. Here is an extract:\n“Since the early 1990’s, long-term interest rates have fallen sharply, and this has had enormous implications for all our economies. Countries such as the United States, United Kingdom and some others in Europe were faced with what were in effect structural trade deficits. Those deficits – an excess of imports over exports – amounted to a continuing drag on demand. So in order to ensure that total demand – domestic demand minus the trade deficit – matched the capacity of their economies to produce, central banks in the deficit countries cut their official interest rates in order to boost domestic demand. That created an imbalance within those countries with spending too high relative to current and prospective incomes. In countries with trade surpluses such as China and Germany, spending was too low relative to likely future incomes [so they did the same – Ed.]. And the imbalance between countries – large trade surpluses and deficits – continued.\nAll this reinforced the determination of central banks to maintain extraordinarily low interest rates. Monetary stimulus via low interest rates works largely by giving incentives to bring forward spending from the future to the present. But this is a short-term effect. After a time tomorrow becomes today. Then we have to repeat the exercise and bring forward spending from the new tomorrow to the new today. As time passes we will be digging larger and larger holes in future demand. The result is a self-reinforcing path of weak growth in the economy. What started as an intentional savings glut has become a major disequilibrium in the world economy. This creates an enormous challenge for monetary policy. Central banks are, in effect, like cyclists pedalling up an ever steeper hill. They have to inject more and more monetary stimulus in order to maintain the same rate of growth of aggregate spending.\nBefore the crisis, many thought that the Great Stability could continue indefinitely and failed to understand that it could not. Their credulity was understandable. After all, GDP as a whole was evolving on a steady path, with growth around historical average rates, and low and stable inflation. But the imbalance in the pattern of spending and saving was far from sustainable, and was leading to the build-up of large stocks of debts. Bad investments were made, encouraged by low real interest rates. The crisis revealed that much of that misplaced investment – residential housing in the United States, Ireland and Spain; commercial property in Britain- was unprofitable, producing losses for borrowers and lenders alike. The impact of the crisis was to make debtors and creditors – households, companies and governments – uncomfortably aware that their previous spending paths had been based on unrealistic assessments of future long-term incomes. So they reduced spending. And central banks then had to cut interest rates yet again to bring more spending forward from the future to the present, and to create more money by purchasing large quantities of assets from the private sector – the practice known as unconventional monetary policy or quantitative easing (QE). There is in fact nothing unconventional about such a practice – so-called QE was long regarded as a standard tool of monetary policy – but the scale on which it has been implemented is unprecedented. Even so, it has become more and more difficult to persuade households and businesses to bring forward once again from an even bleaker future. After a point, monetary policy confronts diminishing returns. We have reached that point.”\nIn other words the imbalances have not gone away. He could have added that we will see a massive increase in unemployment if we cannot eliminate the trade deficit, and that Brexit provides the only opportunity to do so. Indeed we are not just talking about trade imbalances but also about fiscal deficits and unrepayable national debts, as well as the low interest rate, low growth scenario itself. An increase in interest rates would encourage savings which would flow into investments and new technology, thereby increasing productivity and economic growth, but this won’t happen until the imbalances are eradicated. It’s not that the new technology is not there; just that it is not being used. In addition there are also severe imbalances in some particular markets within the UK, such as housing, steel and executive salaries, which also pose a threat to future growth and stability.\nAfter reading such an interesting account of the problems we face, including Lord King’s ideas on the future of bank regulation – an approach he calls the “Pawnbroker for All Seasons”, being a continuous replacement for the crisis-driven “Lender of Last Resort” policy first described by Walter Bagehot – I have to say I came down with a bump during his last chapter, entitled “The Audacity of Pessimism”. It is here he gives his prescription for dealing with these outstanding economic challenges. He has three recommendations, and I add my comments against each one as follows:-\n(1) To enhance productivity in all ways possible. Comment: All in favour of course, but surely all countries around the world will be doing exactly the same thing, so the chances of the UK or other deficit countries stealing a permanent structural march on all the others seem most unlikely to me.\n(2) To extend free trade wherever possible, including TTIP. Comment: See above – surely a series of balanced trade deals will leave the opening imbalances unchanged or even magnified. This after all is why the Doha round collapsed.\n(3) Return to freely floating exchange rates. Comment: I assume he is referring to an end to the eurozone here. And the best of luck with that one M’Lud! Can’t see it happening myself, and anyway it is not within our gift, though I appreciate he is stressing the need for action at international level to avoid what he calls the prisoner’s dilemma.\nSo what is my prescription then? I offer the following ten recommendations, many of which the UK can pursue unilaterally:-\n(1) To set up a UK Sovereign Wealth Fund while interest rates are still on the floor to hedge our national debt, future unfunded pension liabilities and urgent infrastructure improvements. Regular readers will know I have recommended this idea on numerous occasions, for example under my post on Pensions, but the particular relevance here is that\n(a) The investment of a large part of this fund overseas will make the pound more competitive,\n(b) The building up of the fund will increase the national savings rate, and hence investment and economic growth,\n(c) The knowledge that the debt is ultimately covered means we can take a much more flexible and cyclical approach to the fiscal deficit today, concentrating on recovery now and leaving austerity until the recovery has accelerated too far.\n(2) To take advantage of Brexit to set up maximum import tariffs for the UK to minimise our own trade deficit thereby enabling us the start raising interest rates and economic growth, and to help finance our fiscal deficit (again, see above).\n(3) To pursue internationally a global import tariff regime designed to counter global trade imbalances (see my earlier post on Greece, the Eurozone and World Trade). The maximum tariff rates would be set for each country by the WTO in relation both to the size of their trade deficits and to the size of any defaulted sovereign foreign currency debt (see next). Also encourage a global corporation tax regime whereby tax is levied on global profits apportioned to national/global turnover. Only the profits would be reallocated centrally, leaving each country to apply it’s own rate of tax. Start in the UK anyway!\n(4) To allow internationally insolvent countries to carry forward their defaulted debt on an interest-free basis. To haircut capital balances on the other hand would surely lead to contagion across the whole banking system. Such debts would have priory for repayment if and when the country returned to trade surplus.\n(5) Rigorously control our borders so that businesses can no longer take the easy way out by importing cheap staff instead of training up our school leavers or investing in new technology. It will also end wage compression which was such a significant factor in the vote to leave the EU. Our objective must be balanced migration and well as balanced trade. Both are only available through Brexit. Richard Baldwin (see above) opines that controlling our borders will not stop firms from off-shoring, and that is probably true. But unless we do so we cannot stimulate demand and reduce unemployment through traditional Keynesian fiscal and monetary policies, as instead they will only suck in more immigrants. This is indeed is very apparent from current statistics; the indigenous unemployed are not benefiting. Keynes tells us that a balanced economy will create exactly the right number of jobs to meet the requirements of new entrants to the labour market. The fact that we are apparently now dependent on immigration is simply a reflection of these imbalances, including skills and regional imbalances, and over-stimulation of the economy as a result of political pressures.\n(6) Set up a portfolio of Local Community Banks across the UK, either in the ownership of the Bank of England or allow independently, along the lines of the “Bank of Dave” in Bolton and those in Germany, to engage purely in taking in local medium to long-term deposits and lending to local businesses. It seems to me such banks could easily meet Lord King’s “Pawnbroker for All Seasons” test whereby effective liquid assets must always exceed effective liquid liabilities, and the effect, particularly in areas of higher unemployment, would help to reduce the regional disparities which were also a significant factor in the vote the leave the EU.\n(7) Complete welfare reform along the lines set out in my earlier post here in order really to make work pay. The previous government introduced all sorts of sticks but no carrots. We need both, including a big increase in the UC earnings disregards in place of the duplicate tax credits system. Also introduce a separate self-assessed benefit for the self-employed which would only be continued on receipt of a monthly return of hours worked and income. Over-claims would attract a high rate of interest. This will give us a better indication of underemployment in this growing sector of the labour market and therefore a better indication of where we are in the economic cycle.\n(8) Quarantine those UK markets which are themselves in disequilibrium, ie\n(a) The housing market. Introduce macro prudential measures to limit the availability of mortgage finance so as to hold house prices level, or even slightly declining, post-code by post-code across the country. As well as creating stability this would\n(i) provide an additional string to the bow of regional policy,\n(ii) remove the expectation of property gains whereby the rich get richer by doing nothing,\n(iii) reduce the danger of repossessions,\n(iv) encourage property developers to build on and sell their land banks.\n(b) The steel industry. Set tariff levels so that imports are no greater than the excess of domestic demand over 90% of domestic supply. Promote competition within the UK steel industry but limit profits with a cap, and restrict pay increases to those necessary to prevent a rise in staff turnover rates.\n(c) Executive and professional employee pay. Introduce Cheapest Competent Candidate procedures, starting with the public sector and then by inclusion into company law. Also consider the introduction of Supervisory Boards for all public companies, comprising perhaps the six largest shareholders, three executives and the chairman, to ensure a shareholder veto over this and other strategic decisions. See this earlier post.\n(9) Regional policy. Introduce a second personal allowance into the income tax system so that those living in areas of higher unemployment pay less tax on any given income that those living in areas of low unemployment. Adjust as you go along to achieve an even and stable level of percentage employment across the country. See this earlier post.\n(10) Introduce a National Credit Card so that all citizens can choose between the public and private sectors for their ‘public’ services, both effectively free at the point of delivery, but with the latter on a means test applied after the event via the tax system. This can be introduced gradually by varying the means test gradient as supply rises to meet demand in the private sector, and will consequently both reduce the burden on the taxpayer and improve the efficiency and quality of the services provided in both sectors though competition. Working capital at 5% can be provided by the Sovereign Wealth Fund. See this earlier post.\nIn many respects a successful hard Brexit is very like victory at El Alamein, of which Churchill famously said “This is not the end of the war. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it may just be the end of the beginning”. Brexit merely provides the opportunity to avoid Armageddon. There will follow several years of hard graft before we can secure balanced trade and migration, during which we shall have to hold back on growth to prevent inflation. Let us never forget that the establishment almost entirely backed Halifax for Prime Minister in 1940. The Remainians won’t go quietly, but we shall fight them at the polls, we shall fight them in the press and in the media. We shall never give up!",
  "https_jepoynton_com_/https_jepoynton_com_2016_05_08_the-economic-consequesces-of-immigration/content_34.html": "Do we really want to carry on like this?\nThis graph shows how the average real standard of living in the UK has changed over the last 25 years (GDP ÷ population and inflation). The figures are discounted by 0.5%pa for average technological productivity growth. You can see a peak in 2004, which was when the immigration floodgates opened. Many people argue that immigration is good for our economy, but that just doesn’t show up in the figures. Judge by results. Of course the banking crisis in 2008 made the fall greater, but that has now largely washed through, and anyway the index is down to below 100 by 2008. Yet we are still 22.5% worse off than in 2004 (excluding productivity growth).\nThe index is set at 100 for 1991. If I had included 1990 the starting point would have been higher than 2004! The benefits of the 1992 ERM exit devaluation do show up quite clearly though.\nThere are clearly four principle factors involved here: productivity, immigration, the trade deficit with the EU (which exports jobs) and the banking crisis. I have tried to isolate the effect of immigration and the EU trade deficit by removing productivity by the admittedly rather crude expedient of assuming a constant rate of 0.5% per annum. It would in fact have been likely to have been higher before 2004 when investment was buoyant, and lower thereafter. I have not however so far found a way of removing the effect of the banking crisis, so the graph still shows the two effects combined. I shall have a look at levels of perhaps consumer borrowing as an indicator of the latter and edit this post shortly accordingly.",
  "https_jepoynton_com_/https_jepoynton_com_author_jepoynton_page_2/content_42.html": "One of the joys of our new Whats App sites is that you can have a jolly good debate over important issues and, as long as it doesn’t get personal, which all good debaters avoid, make substantial progress in developing them.\nInevitably in the aftermath of Brexit the debate has turned to the position of the party on the political spectrum. Before it really didn’t matter too much as we were all united behind the common objective of getting Britain out of the European Union. We have members from all walks of life and background, but once the tide goes out you can see what’s below!\nOur constitution, clause 2.5, says we are a democratic libertarian party. Small ‘d’ and small ‘l’. It does not say, as some have claimed, that we are a Libertarian party, with a capital ‘L’. I don’t know how much thought went into the original wording? Perhaps not very much and they were just looking for something vaguely neutral. However it says what it says, so what does it mean and do we want to change it? I discovered a general reluctance to change the constitution, but I don’t think many realise quite what a Mad Dictator’s Charter we have been lumbered with. However I am not going to go into that here as I have covered it in a previous post.\nMy immediate reaction is that the words ‘democratic’ and ‘libertarian’ qualify each other. Traditional libertarian theory pretty much means no taxes and no government, at least in its American incarnation, where all taxation is regarded as theft and only those paying into the pot should be entitled to a vote. This was the position espoused by John Stuart Mill writing in the 1860s and based on the theories of classical economics. Since then of course John Maynard Keynes has produced his General Theory in which he introduced the concept of involuntary unemployment and observed that economic equilibrium can occur at less than full employment. Keynes’ view is now mainstream. More recently we have become familiar with the notion of dysfunctional markets where the imbalance of supply and demand is so great that the price mechanism no longer works, such as in housing or steel, and government intervention is required.\nMills’ theories are not redundant however, particularly in the realm of social justice, and Keynes himself was careful to stress that the classical laws of economics remain valid in normal conditions. As with Einstein’s general theory in physics, the classical laws only break down in extreme circumstances such as for matter approaching the speed of light or the interaction between subatomic particles. In fact I think Keynes was being a tad pompous in comparing himself with Einstein because by the time he was writing he was analysing a different ‘nature’ whereas Einstein was explaining more deeply the original nature. That is because during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries the introduction of a full franchise and the advent of trades unions meant that a resistance to the downward movement of wages had developed which was not there before.\nThe principle tenet of JS Mill’s philosophy that I adhere to is that of the ‘Tyranny of the Majority’. If the majority decides everything then nothing is left to the discretion of the individual or to minority rights. Classic examples were Labour’s disbandment of catholic adoption agencies and their insistence on single-stream comprehensive schools and persecution of independent schools. In neither case is there any overriding national interest involved; no need for uniformity across the land. The Socialist view is totalitarian ideology in which Big Sister knows best.\nA free society might be defined as one in which the domain of morality is greater than the scope of the law. A bit like concentric circles it is the size of the gap in between them. A free society requires respect for the law, and that will only occur if everyone is equal under it. The law is there to protect us from harm or loss by third parties, and to enable us to deal with confidence with second parties. It is not there to protect us from ourselves nor to coerce us into patterns of behaviour which are simply of convenience to the state. A free society requires a strong sense of moral responsibility and history shows that it not only requires one, it also breeds one. By comparison in the EU, where most laws are based on Napoleonic law, you can only do what the law permits you to do. Here it is the other way around. That is now threatened by incoming alien cultures to replace the threat posed by the EU.\nAll libertarians reject the tyranny of socialism, but how far to the right do you have to go to escape it? This depends on whether the majority of voters are socialist or libertarian, and I am quite sure the majority in this country are libertarian. Indeed I maintain that the word ‘democratic’ in ‘democratic libertarian’ places us firmly at the centre of the political spectrum pretty much by definition. That is where the votes are, and there is no point in taking an extremist position where there aren’t any. Activists in all parties like the simple clarity of extremist positions, but activists are not typical of the general population.\nSo we need a simple yardstick to say what government should be about and what it should leave to the discretion of the individual. I suggest that yardstick should be the concept of ‘national interest’ as assessed objectively by its very nature. For example there is clearly a national, or common interest in defence and equality under the law. That means we must raise sufficient taxes to pay for these things as a common good. It also introduces the concept of a transfer of wealth from rich to poor as our tax systems are progressive. The money could not be raised otherwise.\nOther areas of policy are more debatable, but I argue that there is no national interest in allowing an unemployable underclass to develop. Not only do you have to be educated but you also have to be fit and healthy to pursue and hold down a job, and you have to be free of such structural unemployment factors such as the poverty trap and skill and regional imbalances. So education, health, welfare and regional policy also qualify, and so on. Those who argue that all taxes are theft should try earning a living on a desert island. They only reason they can do so is because they are part of a society that provides them with the economic opportunities and framework of law in which to do so, so some recompense is surely only just. I also pointed out that I do not myself now pay tax! Every year I use savings to make additional pension contributions so as to keep my taxable income to within the personal allowance. I would be pretty pissed off if I lost my right to vote as a result!\nAt the start of our discussions I tried to quantify such a centre position by saying we should limit central government expenditure to 35% of GDP. After all we have just been through a general election where Labour wanted to increase it to over 40% yet at the same time we are struggling to balance the books with a pre-Covid deficit of around £40bn, or 2% GDP, when the OECD says central government is currently spending 33.5% GDP and many public services are clearly struggling. This drew some sharp intakes of breath in certain quarters. OK the constitution in Clause 2.5 does go on to say that we will “seek to diminish the role of the State and lower the burden of taxation on individuals and businesses”. I can go along with that provided we remember that the majority of people in this country clearly want decent public services and a reliable welfare state. That means focusing on efficiency and possibly also on alternative sources of finance. There are plenty of opportunities to do so as my policy contributions demonstrate.",
  "https_jepoynton_com_/https_jepoynton_com_2016_02_12_rupa-huq-and-the-ealing-gazette/content_70.html": "Early in February the Ealing Gazette carried an article by Rupa Huq, MP for Ealing Central and Acton, supporting Britain’s continued membership of the European Union. My colleague and our GLA candidate, Alex Nieora, responded with a letter, which was edited down, and I with a fuller article, for which, predictably, space could not be found. So here is the full story, starting with Rupa Huq’s original article. I reproduce them without comment as each speaks for itself.\nRupa Huq’s Article.\n“The word ‘crisis’ tends to be much over used in politics. Every year we have an NHS winter crisis and I have even raised the spectre of a curry crisis in the House of Commons before Christmas last year to George Osborne. But on the fate of our European membership it is no exaggeration to say that it would be nothing short of a crisis if we were to exit. To leave behind our biggest trading partner would put jobs and growth at serious risk.\nEurope has also been a source of social reforming legislation, like maternity and paternity leave for new parents. EU competition agreements have brought down airline ticket prices. It is by working together with our European partners that we can catch criminals who do not operate within national borders through mechanisms such as the European arrest warrant. Our island is much stronger with the combined might of 28 nation states rather than the fanciful idea that we could ever go it alone.\nImplications are wide-ranging – the universities’ science research budget that is working on cures to fatal diseases only functions due to European funding. David Cameron does not really want to leave but he is managed to have his tail wagged by a dangerous minority of extremists and Euro obsessives in the Conservative party. He is now boxed into a corner with his renegotiations, which are only being conducted to appease the Eurosceptic headbanger wing of his party – a rash promise made when he saw support ebbing away to UKIP. It is a sad day when government policy appears to be written by Nigel Farage.\nIn an age of globalisation we are part of numerous international alliances – NATO and the UN are others. It has been claimed that our historical ties to the Commonwealth act as an impediment to our playing a full part the EU. This is far from the case – it is not a mutually exclusive relationship. We can have the best of all worlds by participating in both Commonwealth on the one hand, with the Queen as figurehead and countries that once formed the empire, and on the other the European Union, which has so crucially kept the peace post World War Two in a continent previously ravaged by two world wars in a short space of time”\nAlex then responded as follows:\n“I write in response to Rupa Huq MP’s opinion piece in the Ealing Gazette last week. Contrary to what Dr. Huq’s asserts most of UK trade is not concluded with the EU. UK businesses now trade more with the rest of the world than with the EU, although the EU prevents the UK from signing trade agreements with other countries. This means that exports to the UK from developing world nations such as, for example, the Congo are forced to pay tariffs as they cross the EU Common Customs Border putting Congolese exporters at a competitive disadvantage. Moreover EU regulations act as a hindrance to the 80% of UK small and medium sized businesses that do not trade with the EU, while protecting corporate interests.\nDr. Huq mentions ‘European funding’ for science research without realising perhaps that the UK now pays the EU a staggering £12 billion more per year than the paltry 49p in the £ which it gets back from the EU. There is no ‘EU funding’ Dr. Huq – it is British taxpayers’ money.\nDr. Huq talks about EU ‘’competition agreements’’ but overlooks the impact that the 30,000 strong permanent corporate lobby in Brussels has on legislation that imposes restrictions and obstacles for would be competitors and smaller businesses. I doubt she has heard of gallium arsenide. It’s a compound semi-conductor used in microelectronics to make smart phones, integrated circuits, solar panels etc. Great you would think. Well French corporate interests have succeeded in getting the EU to ban gallium arsenide across the EU commencing from this year because it is a threat to their silicon based manufacturing interests. And the worst part is the UK’s MEPs who make up barely 8% of the European Parliament are powerless to do anything about this, or indeed anything else.\nPerhaps Dr. Huq has heard of TTIP, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership deal between the EU and the US which threatens the NHS, by opening up public services to competition from the private sector and allowing corporates to sue governments who enact policies that negatively impact their profits. Both UKIP, Labour and other MEPs voted against these terms in the European Parliament but were outvoted no thanks to the small and ever decreasing British influence in the EU. While in the EU the UK can do absolutely nothing to prevent the implementation of TTIP, or indeed to renationalise the railways if it so wanted (due to the First Railways Directive) or a whole raft of other policy areas.\nDr. Huq disingenuously says the word ‘crisis’ is overused before writing ‘every year we have an NHS winter crisis’. Perhaps I might remind her that the NHS is indeed in crisis, and the last Labour government is largely to blame. The NHS is riddled with extortionate debt from decades of misguided PFI contacts. The NHS owes £80bn in PFI loan unitary charges. Next year alone trusts will make some £2bn in repayments. While PFI contracts were started by the Conservative government under John Major under the Labour government between 1997 and 2008 90% of all hospital construction funding was under PFI agreements.\nPerhaps she is further aware but conveniently overlooks that each week politicians send £350 million to the EU net – that’s enough to build a new hospital every week. Dr. Huq mentions social reform legislation from the EU but omits to mention that most social reform and welfare state legislation was introduced by the UK Parliament a long time before the UK joined the EEC as it then was. As Tony Benn would have been the first to tell her the British government can just as easily pass social reform legislation as the EU but at a far less national debt accumulating cost.\nThe only crisis will happen if British voters listen – to use your own terms, Dr. Huq – to ‘dangerous extremist’ pro EU politicians”\nAnd my contribution was\n“Rupa Huq’s article last week claiming that Britain would be stronger in Europe is profoundly mistaken on so many fronts. Her case is purely negative and concentrates on what she perceives to be the risks of leaving, not mentioning a single one of the many far greater risks of staying in.\nShe starts by claiming that it is necessary for Britain to stay in the Single Market. Others have similarly accused UKIP for failing to give a clear picture of what it would be like outside. WRONG on both counts! We have always said that we would take up again our vacant seat at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and trade with the EU on exactly the same basis that the US, China, Japan and many others do so successfully at present. That automatically would be the situation immediately after Brexit.\nQuite separately there is the proposition that we could negotiate a new treaty with the EU effectively giving us zero-tariff access to the Single Market as at present. That of course remains to be seen, but don’t forget we trade at a huge deficit with the EU. So the betting is not only on the EU being the more desperate to continue with the current arrangements, but also that without a deal a bit of old-fashioned protectionism would in fact be to our advantage. Yes, trade volumes in both directions would be lower, but so would the trade deficit. And trade deficits export jobs. Any loss of jobs from a reduction in exports would be more than offset by job creation from import substitution. The import tariffs would help fund our public services and reduce our fiscal deficit, and the reduction in international trade volumes would save energy. Further the SM is highly unstable, like removing the bulkheads from an ocean-going oil tanker, thereby undermining economic growth. Thus four strong positive reasons for not re-joining the Single Market. Whilst we would not be the first to raise tariffs, we would of course respond in equal measure if tariffs were raised against us. So please, do not lose any sleep over this issue. We can handle it either way.\nDr. Huq then claims we would lose all the beneficial employment and other legislation we have derived from the EU. WRONG again! The day after Brexit the statute book would remain exactly the same as now. We can then decide for ourselves whether we keep those laws, change them or ditch them.\nNext she claims our security would be at risk without solidarity within the EU. Still WRONG! There will be nothing to prevent us from co-operating fully with Europol or any other institution on the continent where we have a mutual interest in so doing. She claims that peace in Europe since WW2 has been kept by the EU, whereas most commentators attribute this success to NATO. Even today the EU has no significant military capability, though of course Brussels is itching to spend yet more money on what inevitably will be a fractious and ineffective force.\nThen she claims we are safer with mechanisms like the European Arrest Warrant. This is a bit like saying we would be safer under a dictatorship. What about human rights? In this country a person is innocent until proven guilty. Not so on the continent where, under the Napoleonic Code, it is the other way around. She talks of the ‘combined might’ of the 28 states. Excuse me? What combined might? Not been very apparent during the refugee crisis, has it? And of course our influence as one of 28 countries is next to nothing, as David Cameron is currently demonstrating.\nNext comes the assertion that our universities and other current recipients of EU funding would lose that funding. Also WRONG! Because we pay into the EU more than we get out we shall save not only the net deficit on funding, now some £12 billion a year, but also the value of all the funds we currently receive. We can, if we wish, guarantee that all current EU payments into the UK will continue £ for £ from those savings instead.\nAt least Dr. Huq has not repeated the hoary old canard that Britain would lose jobs if we left the EU. I assume simple logic has now informed her that once we control our borders, only possible outside the EU, the labour market will tighten because of the fall in the supply of workers. Leaving the EU will be good for both jobs and wages – an end to wage compression and a start to reducing the income spread and all the adverse effects of overcrowding such as the housing crisis.\nDr. Huq’s letter is full of emotive words such as ‘fanciful’, ‘headbanger’, ‘extremist’ and ‘obsessive’. She even claims that ‘it is a sad day when government policy appears to be written by Nigel Farage’! This is sure sign of a politician on the back foot. Let’s have fewer personal insults and more well-researched argument. I see UKIP as a libertarian centrist party committed to getting Britain out of the European Union. We always have been. We believe strongly in fairness and human rights as well as creating a freer society for those who want to be creative and enterprising. We call time on Labour’s deceitful propaganda.”",
  "https_jepoynton_com_/https_jepoynton_com_2016_03_21_reply-to-sir-john-major-in-the-sunday-telgraph-of-20th-march-2016/content_71.html": "Dear Sir,\nIt is Sir John Major who is suffering from fantasies over the EU, and I can see why. He wants to blank out that it was our exit from the ERM in 1992 that set up twelve years of strong economic growth; not EU membership as he claims. In fact since 2004 our living standards have fallen and never recovered.\nDoes he think we have any hope of resolving the housing crisis unless we can control our borders by leaving the EU? Does he imagine it will be possible to maintain a cohesive society by ending wage compression and reducing the pay gap without doing so? How are our SMEs going to provide the jobs we need without removing the tourniquet that EU regulations impose upon them? And how does he think we are going to protect ourselves once the EU has absorbed GCHQ, MI5 and MI6 into some new central incompetence? Indeed Brexit may well set up a new devaluation with all the consequent benefits we enjoyed after the exit from the ERM.\nSir John is disingenuous in comparing 45% of our exports that go to the EU with 7% of theirs coming here; apples and pears. It is irrelevant how much they export to the rest of the world; we are looking at the bilateral position here. And that shows a goods deficit of £89 bn last year; over 5% of GDP just with the EU alone! They are bleeding us dry; a veritable haemorrhage of jobs. Even in the worst, worst case scenario where they raise the maximum WTO tariffs against us and we do not retaliate, the percentage barriers are small compared to the likely benefit of devaluation. Britain will still be attractive to inwards investment, and the small increase in import prices is a small investment to make for the subsequent growth. Food prices in fact are likely to fall as we come out of the CAP and CFP. If we do raise import tariffs in retaliation they will provide much-needed additional fiscal revenues as well as promote import substitution.\nThere is no leap into the dark here. We know exactly what life will be like after we leave. On Brexit all our trading arrangements, security deals and laws will remain unaltered by default. They won’t change unless somebody changes them, and the EU cannot risk the consequences of trying. The only change is that we will save a net £12 bn or so from our membership fees, and that is after replacing all of the payments that Scotland and others receive. The point is that we do not need any new deal with the EU. We will not be dependent on the EU in any way. We can simply walk away if we do not like anything Brussels may propose.\nSir John is however right on one point; that we have a choice between Great Britain and Little Britain. He has just got it the wrong way round!\nYours faithfully,\nAnd here’s a further reflection which I did not include in the letter. The devaluation from the ERM exit in 1992 was worth about 8 or 9%. As I write we already have a 4% devaluation consequent on the announcement of the referendum, so we should certainly get 8% or so after it, and if the maximum tariffs the EU can apply on average are 5%, we are bound to gain either way, even with a 10% maximum for motor vehicles and agricultural produce. But we could go further. Suppose we raised 10% tariffs against against motor vehicles ourselves. We may have to apply those globally, but we import very few vehicle from outside the EU. Most Japanese cars are made here anyway, so it would probably only affect the Koreans. Suppose we then said to both the Koreans and the continental manufacturers that we will not raise any tariffs on spare parts and components worth less than 10% of the value of the whole. They would then have a strong incentive to set up final assembly plants here, creating lots of new jobs in the UK as well as enabling them to continue tariff-free trade to us!\nAs for the rest we could be very selective (not forgetting steel, of course). We produce lots of good cheese in this country so that would be a good target, but not much wine which would not.\nAs regards steel, this is clearly a special case as a result of Chinese dumping. The global steel market will not ‘get back to normal’ until there have been significant reductions in capacity. Most commentators agree that a global economic recovery will not be sufficient. But whose capacity should be up for the chop? Why should it be ours? Even the Chinese themselves are now restricting imports, along with the Americans and many others, but we are not allowed to do so by EU rules.\nLogic would suggest that the least efficient plants should go first. But that does not take account of ongoing investment and technological change. So I am bound to conclude that the ideal solution for the UK is to create a temporary closed market in steel – neither imports nor exports being allowed until the global market stabilises and UK capacity being set to supply UK demand. Whether the existing capacity is nationalised or nationally recapitalised, like the banks, it should be allowed to set prices within the market to enable it to be profitable overall. That market would of course have to be regulated, and the best basis for that would be a cap-and-collar profit regulation regime combined with quality inspections. By that I mean setting a range for profitability, perhaps 5% =/- 2.5%, so that if average profits went outside that range national prices would have to be adjusted according, other factors being equal. Such a regime would have to be applied on an industry wide basis of course so that new entrants with more efficient processes could still have an incentive to replace older suppliers who could not keep up.\nNice letter but you have accepted the lie that John-boy and Remain have published that only 7% of EU exports come to UK – in fact the UK accounts for 16% of the EU’s good exports according to the European Commission’s own figures (NIESR, November 2015, link).\nCheers\nLikeLike\nI am sure you are right! My focus is on the size and direction of the current account deficit which presents British business with a contracting market. This both destroys jobs and undermines investment and hence economic growth, which has fallen from 2.8% in 1999 to 0.7 % in 2019, as well as being a loss in its own right, now running at about £120bn a year. If you take the tax burden as being a third of GDP that also represents a loss of revenue to the exchequer of £40bn. My analysis has probably developed bit further since I wrote that letter!\nLikeLike",
  "https_jepoynton_com_/https_jepoynton_com_2015_10_01_the-story-of-the-economist-three-fishermen-and-a-politician/content_49.html": "Just back from Conference, where the atmosphere was upbeat and united in prospect of success in the OUT campaign (despite as usual what the press had claimed!). I was also intrigued by a fringe group called FreeKip, run by Councillors Bill Etheridge MEP and Paul Brothwood and by Phil Henrick, which is putting together ideas on economic policy and which, as you will know, is very much my own core interest. They have produced a document called The Mount Charles Charter, and I shall be responding to it fully shortly. You can find it here.\nAt dinner that evening I was at first sitting next to a spare place when a delightful young lady came and sat beside me. We fell into conversation and it transpired that she had recently joined UKIP from Labour. I asked what areas of policy she was most interested in and she soon said that she knew little about the private sector.\nNow this should have been a red rag to a bull, but I found myself waffling somewhat and afterwards felt I had not done justice to the subject. So here, with the benefit of hindsight, and in case I see her again, is my Story of the Economist, Three Fishermen and a Politician.\n“Once upon a time there was an Economist. Now this was in the days before fishing and politics, whereas of course there have always been economists with us. Our economist liked nothing better than to sit upon the beach looking out to sea and to ponder the ways of the world.\nAnd it came to pass one day as he sat there that he spotted a large shoal of cod swimming about freely in the sea. So he said to himself “Hm. Those fish look good to eat and the people are starving. I wonder how much they are worth?” So he thought, and he thought, and he thought, but eventually he concluded that they weren’t worth anything at all. After all anyone could go out and catch them, but also there were no buyers out there in the sea. So if demand is zero, value must also be zero. Indeed he concluded this principle applies to all natural resources in situ; it is only when Man extracts them that value is added to them.\nNow as he sat there, savouring his new-found wisdom, a young man came along and sat and entered into conversation with him. And when he learnt of the fish in the sea he said “Wow. I wonder how much money I could make if I caught those fish and sold them to the people, who are starving”. And the Economist encouraged him, saying that barriers to entry to this industry are low. And so he did.\nSo it came to pass that in due course the young fisherman landed his first catch upon the quayside. And as he did so the Economist called out to him and asked “How are you going to price your fish? If you price them too high you won’t sell them all, but if you price them too low you won’t make as much money as you might have done.” But the young fisherman was canny and replied “I shall adjust my price as I go along so that I just attract enough customers to buy all my fish.” And so he did.\nAt the end of the day the young fisherman was ecstatic. “Look at all this money I have made. Let us go to the pub and celebrate”. But the Economist was cautious, saying “That is not your profit, that is only your income. By moving the fish from the sea to the quayside you have added value to the fish because the balance of supply and demand on the quayside is more favourable than it was in the sea. And by finding the marginal price you have maximised your income. But you will not know if you have made a profit until you have deducted your costs.”\nIt was only at this point that it dawned upon the young man that his costs, which were not inconsiderable, were an entirely separate and unrelated figure to the value he had added to the fish. Only if his income was greater than his costs would he have made a profit, but it might just as easily be the other way around, making him a loss. So he hastily totted up his costs and, to his great relief, discovered that he had indeed made a large profit.\nAs he and the Economist sat drinking in the pub a second young man came and sat and entered into conversation with them. And when he learnt how much money the first young man had made he exclaimed “Wow. I could do that too, and become as rich as you are”. And the Economist encouraged him saying that barriers to entry to this industry are low. The first young man was also at first pleased at the prospect of having a friend in the industry. And so he did.\nBut when in due course the second fisherman landed his catch beside that of the first upon the quayside, the first fisherman quickly realised that something was wrong. Although he was doing nothing different, and although the level of demand on the quayside remained unaltered, the supply had doubled, which meant that the marginal price had fallen. He was furious and remonstrated with the Economist, but the Economist reminded him that the law required open competition and that there was nothing he could do. So the two fishermen continued to fish and both made reasonable but not excessive profits.\nAnd it was not long before a third young man came and saw the two fishermen making a reasonable but not excessive profit. So he said to himself “I could do that too.” And so he did. But when he landed his third catch beside the first two, the marginal price fell still further and thence all three fishermen made a meagre profit just above the breadline.\nIndeed a fourth young man also came and considered becoming a fisherman. But when he saw the meagre profits the first three were making he decided there was not enough money in it. And so he didn’t. But the people were delighted at the plentiful supply of cheap fish in the shops and considered themselves much better off. As the Economist observed, they were better off because they could now satisfy a greater proportion of their needs.\nIt was at this juncture that the Politician arrived on the scene. He was under pressure from his voters who were demanding better public services and a more reliable welfare state, and wanted protection from many nasty foreigners who wanted to enslave them in volumes of red tape and regulations, and to chop their heads off. The Politician replied saying “You can have all these services but you must pay taxes for them as they do not grow on trees.” But the people were angry and protested violently saying “These are our Human Rights. They must be freely available to all. If you want to tax anyone, go and tax those fat fishermen over there. Do not tax us as that is not fair.” And so he did.\nBut the Politician, not being of the UKIP variety, had not done his homework and when he did as the people demanded and imposed a profits tax on the fishermen he discovered it produced very little revenue. So he went back to the people and said again they must pay taxes for the services they wanted. But the people grew even angrier, shouting ‘conspiracy’ and ‘tax evasion’ and ‘fraud’, so the Politician had to find other ways of taxing the fishermen.\nSo he imposed business rates, and employers’ national insurance, and insisted the fishermen take expensive training courses to obtain qualifications they did not need. And lo his friends in local government joined in too, imposing parking charges and other restrictions, and painting yellow lines all around.\nBut the fishermen were sore afraid because they knew their costs would now exceed their income. And so they did, and they all went bust.\nAnd the people were by now indignant also, asking “What has happened to that plentiful supply of cheap fish which was in the shops and which is no more, for we are starving once again.” And they blamed the Politician for mismanaging the economy, even though he had simply done as they had demanded.\nSo they all lived miserably ever after. Indeed quite a lot of them died.”",

If you would prefer not to receive further newsletters please let me know and I will remove you from the circulation list.\nIf you have your own list of local contacts please feels free to forward this on to them.\nThe views expressed in this newsletter are my own and may not therefore correspond exactly with UKIP official policy. However I am not aware of any conflicts.\nJuly 2015 Budget: Osborne announces a 1 million increase in unemployment.\nWell, he did not put it quite like that of course. What he did say was that the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has forecast the creation of 1 million new jobs over the next five years. What neither he nor the OBR added however is that, on the basis of current trends, we will by then have 2 million more new immigrants. Simply deducting one figure from the other shows how net unemployment will increase. And it won’t be the immigrants who are unemployed, though many will be working for scant wages as part of some board and lodging scam, thereby adding to wage compression for the rest of us. The young, the old and the disabled are all set to find jobs more difficult to find.\nHe also tells us that unemployment is down to 5.5%, but omits to include the thousands of people now classified as self-employed but who are not earning a penny, the thousands more sanctioned off benefits, and the many thousands in part time jobs who want full-time employment. It’s pure window-dressing. The real danger is that he believes his own propaganda, which in turn will lead to further mismanagement of the economy.\nBecause the other big mistake he makes is to treat welfare expenditure as fixed. It’s not. It’s cyclical. It goes up and down with unemployment. He tells us that “Britain is home to 1% of the world’s population; generates 4% of the world’s income; and yet pays out 7% of the world’s welfare spending”. Frankly that is precisely what I would expect in the middle of a recession. Historically the surplus/deficit changes by about £25 bn for every 1% change in unemployment. And he knows this because he is only trying to save £37 bn over the next five years when the deficit is over £75 bn, and yet predicts a surplus at the end of it. Either that, or he can’t add up – you can take your pick!\nNot that I hold any candle for tax credits, nor for the effect they have on breeding for benefits. There is certainly scope for savings there, and that is the big thing he got right. Credit where credit is due.\nAnd then there is the news that average weekly earnings are rising by 3.3% per annum. What we are not told is how the rich are once again surging ahead at the expense of the poor.\nFor a fuller analysis of the budget please see my blog article here, and on Welfare reform here.\nWheelie Bins\nHot topic in Ealing just at the moment. But how many of you realise that in fact you don’t have any choice in the matter anyway? It is the result of an EU Directive (No. 2008/98, which you can read here if you are a masochist) which requires every council to recycle at least 50% of your waste. This can only be achieved with wheelie bins, so that you can sort your ex-stuff out for them. You might get some influence over the time of collection, or even the size of the bins, but what you can’t avoid is having to sort your waste. And that requires multiple bins. Thought you lived in a democracy? You don’t. You just have to do as you’re told.\nSo if you want to go back to living in a democracy there is only one action that should achieve this – voting OUT in the forthcoming referendum.\nExecutive Pay: A closed market.\nThe perennial problem of excessive executive pay is raising its ugly head again, this time as regards the BBC and NHS.\nNow I am a capitalist in the mould of Adam Smith, who observed that capitalism is only of benefit to society if it is contained within a strong framework of law, both to control fraud and prevent deceit, and to ensure open competitive markets. It is open competition which ensures profits not profiteering, and these are the constraints which make capitalism a form of socialism.\nYet these days executive recruitment is entirely conducted behind closed doors by head-hunters. It is a closed shop. We don’t tolerate closed shops from the Unions, so why should we do so from head-hunters? You can find a broader discussion of the situation on my blog here. In essence I am proposing the introduction of a procedure I call Cheapest Competent Candidate. At it’s simplest it would require all recruiters for positions above a certain pay level, in the public sector at first but ultimately in Company Law for public companies as well, to produce a short-list of at least five names, and then to require each of them to bid for the job just as you would do with a contractor, appointing the lowest bidder.\nObvious, isn’t it?\nGreece: The Dance of the Dunces.\nWe all of us I am sure have the greatest sympathy for the Greeks in their current predicament. So it has been with considerable frustration that I have watched the negotiators on each side make such a pig’s ear of sorting it out.\nOf course Nigel Farage is absolutely right to say that the best solution for Greece is to abandon the euro and leave the European Union. However we have to accept that, for the present at least, the democratic wish of the vast majority of Greeks is to keep both. So the question arises: was there any other way they could have agreed a constructive way forward? I believe there was and still could be, and I described it more fully on my blog here.\nThose of you who read my election address will recall how I castigated the Coalition for not setting up a Sovereign Wealth Fund to hedge our own national debt. Here we have an even more critical situation where one side wants to write off the debt and the other doesn’t. Hedging it could satisfy both.\nClearly this was a case for Economic Superman. Trouble was, nobody beamed me up! Ok I know that sounds a bit superior but honestly, when you are forced to watch a fiasco such as this, how else can you feel?\nCalais: Global Migration into Europe and the UK.\nThey can’t come here. And they can’t go back. So simple logic tells us they must be provided for somewhere else in a secure and decently run refugee camp. So what have our glorious politicians done about it? Absolutely nothing.\nNow I have never visited the Falklands so I could be mistaken, but at first sight they would appear to make an ideal location for such a refugee camp. The west or south islands in particular. A long way from the UK. Because they are secure and under British sovereignty we could make sure the camp is properly set up and run. Of course it will be expensive, but not half as expensive as any acceptable alternative, and it could be paid for, pro-tem at least, out of our overseas aid budget. Nor do we have to wait for the EU to sort itself out. We can get on with it unilaterally and immediately. Both genuine refugees and economic migrants to the UK could go there straight from Calais or wherever they are found, with the paperwork and appeals sorted out after they arrive. They could be given a small allowance to enable a local in-camp economy to develop which would, through trade, be of benefit to the islanders as well. They would eventually be taken back directly to their home countries, with new passports obtained for them where necessary, when they themselves decided they wanted to go.\nSo what are we waiting for?\nThe coming Referendum Campaign.\nIt is now clear that the OUT campaign will involve many disparate and well funded groups, of which UKIP is but one. You can read how our effort is coming along here. Do please consider making a contribution. This is YOUR future we are talking about. Watch out for future newsletters tackling in detail the issues involved.\nUKIP is onto a winner either way. If the referendum is successful then our raison d’etre is fulfilled and we can all go home. If not it will leave UKIP as the ONLY remaining route out of the EU and our support will rocket. There would then be a real chance of UKIP filling the vacuum left by Labour and the LibDems as the only competent left-of-centre alternative to the Tories.\nOur Values: Reflections on my 2015 General Election campaign.\nI have a confession to make. I was over-confident. And as a result lost my deposit. Not what I expected at all. Even so, everyone else thought 4.1% was good going. My mistake was to get distracted for a few days by family matters; not to send an article to the Ealing Gazette like the other candidates; and missing one important hustings. Also if I had canvassed the Southall Green ward, which I hardly touched, as thoroughly as Southall Broadway, where I personally delivered a leaflet to every house and had many street conversations, and where most of my votes came from, I would probably have reached 8 or even 10%. Ah well, as my mother never ceased to tell me, pride comes before a fall. Whether having had some helpers and a budget of more than £1500 would have made any difference I am not so sure. Personal contact was everything.\nI was also disappointed not to be offered a closing speech at the declaration. So for the record here is what I would have said:\n“Well, it was not to be. Even so it has been a pleasure and a privilege for me these last few weeks to meet so many of you as I have canvassed around, and I can only regret that I managed to cover so little, about a quarter, of the constituency in all. Most of you I found to be open-minded and genuinely interested to discover for yourselves what UKIP stands for, and on the odd occasion where that was not so I was glad of the opportunity to correct some of the misconceptions that appear to have arisen about us.\nWe are of course a multi-ethnic, multi-class one-nation libertarian party. We believe that all races, all colours, all creeds and all faiths should be treated equally. We do not condone discrimination of any kind, positive or negative, and believe that selection should always be based on merit alone. We see ourselves as a left-of-centre progressive party with an agenda not only to create greater fairness and equality of opportunity in society, but also with a passion to re-establish Britain’s independence, her freedom to create her own laws, and to have a government that is accountable only to the British people and to no-one else.\nListening to the television coverage as it has unfolded this evening, it now seems that we shall have a small majority Conservative government. And whilst I share with you many reservations about that, I do rejoice that now, almost certainly, we shall get a referendum on Britain’s future independence from the European Union. I look forward to that campaign, and in particular to the opportunity to have a debate about the future of our country free I hope from the divisive party loyalties and prejudices that so often disfigure political discourse in this country.\nLet us now come together as one nation, and as one society, to make this momentous constitutional decision. I am confident that the British people, including of course all of us here in Ealing Southall, will have the courage to stand up for our country, for her freedom and for her independence, as valiantly as any previous generation. Of course there will be the nay-sayers, and the appeasers, including much of big business, too timid to countenance any change at all. But we shall expose their bland assertions, and their lazy assumptions, and establish beyond all reasonable doubt the case for leaving the European Union.\nSo until then it only leaves me now to thank all of you who have made this election today run as smoothly as it has, to congratulate Mr. Sharma on his emphatic victory, and to wish all of you good night, such as is left of it, and god bless.”\nIncidentally, you may be wondering where I am in this photo of the declaration platform published by the Ealing Gazette? So am I! As I recall Mrs. Sharma was standing close by her husband’s left shoulder, and I was close next to her. We both appear to have been airbrushed out! Ve-ry in-ter-est-ing! I shall leave you to draw your own conclusions.\nNew UKIP Ealing Website\nOur local party covers the three constituencies Ealing Southall, Ealing North and Ealing Central and Acton, and our joint website is being updated in advance of the referendum campaign. You can find it here.\nWith best wishes to you all\nJohn Poynton BSc. FCA FIMC\nUKIP Parliamentary Candidate for Ealing Southall 2015\nhttp://jepoynton.com",
  "https_jepoynton_com_/https_jepoynton_com_2017_01_14_balanced-migration/content_57.html": "As argued previously, both globalisation and the EU Single Market have created huge instability in both trade and migration. The majority of the British people now understand that it is not racist to want to bring uncontrolled immigration back into balance, but what would the necessary immigration controls actually look like, and would they be both fair and firm as well as both effective and civilized?\nIn fact our existing controls are far from being either effective or civilized. Border officials are often faced with having to make ad hoc decisions which inevitably are prejudiced and subjective. That is no more fair on them than it is on the unfortunate visitor, and it paints an embarrassing picture of this country. For example not so long ago a Jamaican woman turned up at Southampton wanting to donate a kidney to her brother who was waiting for it on dialysis in hospital. The border official did not believe her story and turned her away. Leaving aside the fact that a better trained official could easily have confirmed the story by a phone call to the hospital, the possibility of such a situation should never have arisen in the first place. Then there is the case of the young man who came to this country with his parents from Germany when he was a toddler. His parents opted for him to keep a German passport as a connection with his roots, but despite the fact that he has spent all the rest of his life here he was recently told to leave. There must be a better way.\nSo here are a set of proposals which I believe would do the job. I have loaded them as a pdf file which you can download here. They go beyond the banner of “an Australian style points based system” and put some flesh on the bones. They are only a ‘catalytic’ proposal in that I am sure they can be improved further under peer review, but they are I hope a start.",
  "https_jepoynton_com_/https_jepoynton_com_tag_politics/content_16.html": "Mr. Speaker, it is an honour and a privilege for me to have this opportunity to present to the House the government’s budget for the coming year.\nAs the House will already know, our economy and government finances are in a desperate and sorry state. Over the past nearly 25 years we have suffered a series of setbacks that have enveloped us in a perfect storm, starting with our membership of the European Union Single Market which has seen our trade balance with those countries plummet from having been broadly in balance to a deficit at the time of the Brexit Referendum of £109 billion; that’s 6% of GDP at that time. This has presented British business with a contracting market. Generally speaking business will not invest into a contracting market, with the result that productivity growth has suffered.\nThen we had the banking crisis, triggered by an oil price spike in 2007 which led to the default of many sub-prime mortgages in the USA and which our banks had invested into. But there were also collapses on this side of the pond such as Northern Rock and HBOS which were simply due to over-trading, and that can only be due to a failure of regulation here. One bright spot then arises as the banks were quickly recapitalised through the use of quantitative easing, which did not on that occasion produce inflation as it was merely replacing credit which had been destroyed in the crisis. Unfortunately later on the QE was restarted with inevitable inflationary consequences.\nOn top of all that we had austerity and the failure to start a Sovereign Wealth Fund when interest rates hit the floor. Mr. Speaker, I am sure that most members are aware that 5% compounded will quadruple your money within 30 years, and 7% double it within ten. Over the past thirty years returns on many foreign shares have been far greater than the cost of government borrowing here. That is because the rate of growth in many other countries has been far faster than it has been here and is likely to continue that way for some time to come. It must make sense for us to benefit from their success in this way. A golden opportunity completely missed.\nThen we come to Brexit which some today are blaming for all our financial woes. Mr. Speaker, I do not accept that analysis but instead that the Trade and Co-operation Agreement has locked us into the catastrophic trade deficit we inherited from the Single Market. It is not enough to secure no tariffs in either direction when there are a host of other regulations creating the imbalance, and we need the use of tariffs to counter that effect. That will almost certainly mean scrapping the TCA, and whilst trade volumes may fall, the much greater effect of import substitution will present British business at home with the expanding market they crave to invest and create productivity growth and jobs.\nFollowing that we had Covid and the energy crisis caused by the war in Ukraine, thankfully temporarily as Russia has found other outlets into the international oil markets, and all of the panic over climate change. And if that weren’t enough mass immigration, quite apart from increasing cultural conflict within the country, has condemned wages to minimum levels, undermined working conditions and caused record levels of unemployment and homelessness. And to cap it all, we have an ageing population pushing the cost of pensions and health care through the roof. Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear!\nNow, Mr. Speaker, it is not my intention to spend time trying to apportion blame for this situation. Many of these circumstances were beyond our control, and for others it is easy to be wise after the event. My purpose is to identify the causes so we can take appropriate action to remedy them and to quantify the task itself. Our National Debt is now close to 100% of GDP after having been nearly paid off a quarter of a century ago, and the cost of interest on that debt is now over £100 billion a year, nearly 4% GDP in itself, and rising. The total fiscal deficit is around £170 billion and that is adding to the Debt all the time. It is imperative, Mr. Speaker, that we get our nose ahead of the game so that we can reverse the whole process.\nMy strategy is based on three key objectives necessary to provide a tripod of stability for our recovery. First I aim to achieve a fiscal surplus of 1% GDP within five years. Second I want a trade surplus of 1% GDP by that time, and third we must achieve net zero immigration as well. Add to that some essential tax cuts to motivate growth and expenditure increases to avoid imminent collapse of some public services and we are looking at an annual fiscal turnaround of £300 billion by the end of our first five years.\nOn average I must save £60 billion in each of the next five years, but that is only on average. There are couple of policies which can raise substantial funds in excess of this amount up front, while others such as revived economic growth will be weighted towards the end. The good news is that over the following five years those trends should lead to a much greater turnaround of around £450 billion or more, with much greater scope for both tax cuts and expenditure increases, which I shall aim broadly to keep equal. I shall also aim to cut the total level of taxation down to 30% GDP, whereas currently it is around 37%, all the while maintaining fiscal and trade surpluses of 1% GDP. History shows that all the economies with the highest rates of economic growth have run Balance of Payments surpluses and I am determined the UK should be in that group.\nSo, Mr. Speaker, let me make a start.\nMy first port of call is multinational corporations, which have long had a habit of shifting their profits into tax havens, or semi tax havens such as the Republic of Ireland, to avoid corporation tax in this country. Now I accept that at 25% our rate of corporation tax is too high, and I shall return to that later, but for now may I completely reject the argument that this country must somehow engage in a race to bottom just to remain competitive. There are other ways we can regulate our trade balance, and in any case if were able to collect what is morally due to us, profits made out purchases by the good citizens of this country, that would provide the funds to reduce it.\nOver ten years ago now, the G8 at its summit in Enniskillen tasked the OECD with ending this practice. They have completely failed to do so and show no signs of any significant progress as they just kick the can further on down the road. Clearly the multinationals have got to them! We cannot afford to wait any longer.\nThe good news is that this is very easy to rectify. Henceforth multinationals, which we shall define as any company that has more than 10% of its turnover in more than one country, shall be taxed on the basis of their global profits, as declared to their shareholders and in the public domain, and apportioned to this country by turnover, including non-domestic intercompany sales. They may be able to shift their head offices and their intellectual property rights, but they cannot shift their customers! It is difficult to forecast accurately without an established database exactly how much additional revenue this will raise, but our best estimates suggest it could be within the range of £40 to 50 billion if not more.\nSecond, Mr. Speaker, I am abolishing Inheritance Tax. It is a very inefficient tax, raising only about a third of 1% GDP; is double taxation in the hands of the deceased; uses up a disproportionate amount of tax legislation and consequently distracts the attention of thousands of lawyers and accountants who should be more constructively engaged.\nHowever I recognise that a society in which around 2% of the population own 80% of its assets is not a healthy one. I want to reduce this wealth gap but not eliminate it. It remains important that those with energy, ability and enterprise can profit from them for the benefit of us all. In practice however much of this accumulated wealth is passive asset appreciation.\nI therefore aim to raise about 2% GDP by charging legacies to capital gains tax in the hands of beneficiaries. This would require a 50% withholding tax to counter avoidance, but which would be repaid, with interest, when the gains are presented for assessment. I do not propose to introduce a wealth tax, which would also be double taxation in the hands of the taxpayer as well as very difficult to collect as much of it would disappear into overseas trusts and corporate structures.\nCapital gains will be assessed to income tax at the taxpayer’s marginal rate with no additional allowances. However I am allowing it to be spread over ten years so that poorer beneficiaries can use up more of their allowances and lower rate bands. This reflects the rule-of-thumb PE ratio of 10 often used to value small companies.\nExisting roll-over reliefs from inheritance tax such as for farms and businesses will be maintained and I am adding relief for the repayment of any student loans, not necessarily those of the taxpayer. Tax on occupied primary residences, again not necessarily by the taxpayer or his family, such as a sitting tenant, may be deferred until that occupant leaves.\nI am also abolishing Non-Dom status, but replacing it with a flat cap on income tax, including capital gains, of £250,000 in any one year.\nThese two changes alone should raise around £80 billion a year. I am not seeking to raise any other taxes. I am however reintroducing marginal relief from corporation tax for small businesses with a zero rate allowance of one million and a lower rate band of two million. The lower rate will be half the full rate which remains at 25%. In the longer term I aim to reduce taxation to 30% GDP and increase the personal tax allowance to match the typical minimum wage at £20,000, and reduce the top rate to 40%. I may also introduce an intermediate rate at 30%.\nMr. Speaker I now come to a series of changes focused on reducing the burden on the taxpayer without endangering essential public services by focusing on efficiency and alternative sources of finance.\nBetter late than never I am introducing a Sovereign Wealth Fund which will be funded by borrowing at an interest rate not greater than 5% and at an amount, if available in the gilts markets, of 1% GDP a year. The asset will offset the liability and therefore have no effect on net debt. This will be farmed out to multiple professional fund managers with after time the more successful attracting greater contributions.\nIn addition I am starting the funding of a new state pension. This necessarily must be a gradual and prolonged process which will not have any significant effect on the public finances for many years. It will be available only to those under the age of 25 on 6th April next year and will be optional. Modelling suggests it will primarily benefit those on above average salaries, thereby halving in due course the number in the existing state pension. This in turn may allow us to improve the existing state pension significantly. For those who opt in, the existing employee national insurance contribution of 8% becomes a national pension contribution and is placed in an account in their name to which a guaranteed 4% interest as added annually. Of the three parameters of contribution rate, retirement age and pension amount, they will have the flexibility to fix any two and get a quote for the third. They may opt in or change these parameters at a later date, subject to not reducing the pension to an annuity equivalent below the level that would trigger entitlement to pension credits, and their remaining entitlement to the existing state pension will be determined by the number of years’ contributions in the existing way. This will create a fully flexible and transferable pension scheme which is currently unavailable to many, including those who switch employment between the public and private sectors. The money will physically go into the Sovereign Wealth Fund, which should get a better return for carrying risk, and will be part of its 1% GDP per annum funding target.\nMr. Speaker I am also introducing a National Credit Card. The purpose of the card is to give all citizens access to the private sector for essential services such as health and education on a means-tested basis. Just taking the health and schools budgets alone costs the taxpayer around £250 billion a year. If 50% used the private sector instead, and the average means-tested support for fees was also 50%, then the saving to the taxpayer would be over £60 billion a year.\nWe shall have to introduce this gradually to enable the supply side to meet increasing demand and it will be optional. Users pay for services in the normal way but do not have to settle the card at the end of the month. Instead after the end of the year when the taxman assesses your tax he will also review how much you have spent on your card, put the two together and recharge your share of the cost to your tax bill for the following year. Working capital will come from the Sovereign Wealth Fund at 5% which will be added to your costs from the date of purchase, but users will be able to pay on account to avoid it. The means test rate will be a simple percentage set at the beginning of each fiscal year for each user set in due course to encourage 50% usage. Much of these savings will then be available to improve the state services, and the fact that the private sector is accessible to all will remove any stain of privilege that some attribute to it at present.\nMr. Speaker, with the help of my RH colleagues I am taking a number of measures to improve efficiency within our public services. First we shall be splitting the civil service clean in two so that the advisory side, which advises ministers on current problems and future legislation, becomes completely separate and independent from the executive side, which delivers services mandated by Parliament. Two completely separate functions requiring separate organisational structures. This way the advisory side can assist ministers in holding the executive side to account.\nSecond we shall be appointing a national chief executive with the power to hire and fire local chief executives for every national public service. It is an extraordinary fact that currently few if any of our public services actually have any top management at all. No wonder they are all running around like headless chickens being hopelessly inefficient.\nThese chief executives will be mandated to ensure that sufficient trained British staff are recruited into each service, that they are paid the rate for the job so that staff turnover rates are minimised, and that agency and support staff are reduced to less than 25% of payroll each. I am also allowing staff bonuses to be paid out of 10% of any local budget savings or collected charges.\nThird, I am abolishing national wage bargaining in the tax funded public sector. Henceforth all such staff will be paid a full inflationary increase on 1st April each year. I reject the argument that this will create an inflationary wage spiral on the grounds both that there are no prices in this sector and that inflation increases the tax base anyway. But it is also important for staffing stability that all staff are paid the rate for the job, which will vary by skill and location across the country with additional increases awarded locally and which therefore cannot be addressed on a national basis.\nThese measures taken together could save another £30 billion a year as well as ensure they are no longer dependent on immigration for staff.\nSpeaking of immigration, my RH friend the Home Secretary will be scrapping the current points-based system and replacing it with an auctioned reducing quota system so that total immigration is reduced to below emigration rates within five years. It is therefore vital that we are able to reduce unemployment at the same or faster rate. Indeed we currently have over 3% job vacancies across our economy which is roughly double historical norms and only serves to suck in yet more immigrants. I shall therefore be instructing the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee henceforth to use a composite 4% target when setting interest rates; that is 2% inflation plus 2% job vacancies. I anticipate this will mean interest rates will remain at around the 5% mark for the foreseeable future, which is necessary anyway to encourage savings and fund investment, and will also probably be needed to contain the inflationary impact of wage rises in a tighter labour market. I shall be addressing the housing market separately in a few moments.\nIn addition I have a new regional policy designed to reduce the regional pay and unemployment gaps. It must make sense to focus stimulation to where unemployment is highest post code by post code across the country leading eventually to an even level of percentage employment across the land. This will increase income tax revenues and reduce welfare claims so it is likely to be fiscally neutral in the longer term.\nTo do so I shall cease funding new free tax and enterprise zones, which have a very chequered and uneven history, and instead introduce discounts for income tax, business rates and employers national insurance where the discount is proportionate to the local level of unemployment. For the coming year this discount will be 5% for every 1% that unemployment, measured on the claimant basis, is above 5%. We will review this algorithm annually to ensure a steady reduction in the regional gap.\nI also have a number of measures to free up the labour market to reduce structural unemployment. First I am repealing all IR35 legislation, which was designed to prevent employers avoiding the cost of national insurance contributions on permanent staff, by the simple measure of charging the invoices of self-employed and agency staff to NICs also. Professional fees will be exempt. The increased revenues will be used to reduce employers NICs for all so that the measure is fiscally neutral.\nIn any case I am immediately reducing employers NICs to 12% and increasing the minimum wage and universal credits in line with the triple lock on the state pension. I am also introducing marginal relief for employers NI with a zero alowance of £1000 per week of payroll, and a lower band of £2000 at a rate of half the full rate.\nSecond my RH friend the Work and Pensions Secretary will be undertaking a full post-implementation review of the introduction of Universal Credits with a view to making it simpler and more streamlined and efficient. In particular he will ensure that the thresholds for and rates of clawback are also universal, and that once vetted claimants do not have to reapply every time they get a gap between jobs. This is particularly important for self-employed people who currently often decline short term or low paid assignments because of the hassle and delays in reapplying.\nWithin this context I am increasing the threshold, or earnings disregard, for clawback of universal credits to £50 per week. This will create a much greater incentive for unemployed people to make that first leap back into employment, and will also allow low paid workers in the taper to keep more of what they themselves have earned. This will both reduce the poverty trap and the pressure on food banks many of which are struggling to obtain sufficient supplies.\nMr. Speaker, I now turn to support for farmers and care homes. At first sight they do not have much in common but they are both essential to our wellbeing, are competitive within the private sector and yet need financial support if they are to produce both food and care at affordable levels and remain profitable. Furthermore farmers are in competition with foreign imports which are heavily subsidised.\nFor both industries I am introducing a public subsidy at 10% on turnover. This will be subject to a profit cap at 5% before tax to prevent profiteering by larger businesses at the expense of both taxpayer and customer. The subsidy is designed to promote sales, and the profit cap will encourage competitive pricing and support greater expenditure. Qualifying directors remuneration will be restricted. In future years the rate of subsidy will be adjusted so that no more than 5% of businesses liquidate each year.\nMany businesses in a variety of industries receive public subsidies and there has been much concern at their profits. I am therefore extending the profit cap to all entities in receipt of public subsidy, though the cap may vary according to their capital investment requirements. I am also extending it proportionately to all companies with contracts with the public sector worth annually over 10% of their turnover.\nFinally Mr. Speaker I come to the housing market. I shall be reducing house prices from now on by between 1 and 2% a year on average. This is easily done by giving the Bank of England that target and by tightening criteria such as mortgage to value and income to mortgage used by commercial lenders.\nNow you may at first sight think that would make it more difficult for prospective purchasers to find and buy a new house, but in fact that is not so. For one thing the number of available houses out there does not change, and for another the supply is likely to increase because sellers will hurry to sell before prices reduce further. More importantly developers will no longer be able to make capital gains on their land banks and so can only build houses on them and sell them. In monetary terms the reduction in demand will be matched by a reduction is prices until all available houses are sold.\nThe misconstrued Help to Buy policy has just made matters worse, so I am in effect reversing it. Last year fewer new houses were built than before the policy was introduced over ten years ago and it has just pushed house prices even higher. Irrespective of whether we can balance supply and demand, the amount of credit tied up in the housing market means that house prices are likely to remain high. Yet house prices must come down if younger people are to buy when they get married and start a family and others to escape the parental nest and develop as independent adults.\nCurrently it takes on average over five years to build out a granted planning consent whereas no so long ago it was only two. It has been reported that there are hundreds of thousands of such consents gathering dust in the pending trays of property developers because they can make more money from capital gains. But it is important to understand also that they have themselves been squeezed by increasing land prices. As a result they have endeavoured to recoup their margins by resorting to dodgy practices such as denying buyers adequate snagging periods and tying them up into leaseholds with uncontrollable ground rent increases, and generally cutting costs and building to very low standards. Many such properties are now unsaleable. Mr. Speaker I am giving Help to Buy purchasers a new six month snagging period, with a survey at taxpayer’s expense to ensure objectivity, and with all restitution costs at the sellers expense.\nMy RH friend the Secretary of State for Housing, will be carrying out a full review of planning and related procedures including the possible repeal of the 1961 Land Compensation Act which gives 100% of all planning gain to landowners. We believe it may be more appropriate to divide planning gain equally between landowners, a national development corporation with powers of compulsory purchase to focus new development in the North where there are plentiful brownfield sites available, supported by regional policy which will encourage both people and jobs to move there, and local development corporations who can use the money for local infrastructure thereby creating balanced communities. The South East is overcrowded and current development priorities just make that worse. They are levelling down not levelling up. We will protect and maintain the green belt.\nOn social housing I am restoring the full housing benefit which will become affordable again as immigration falls. This will allow housing associations access to the City for development finance, and I shall be adding a government guarantee to help reduce borrowing costs. We will continue to support Right to Buy as it does not reduce total housing available but I am halving the discounts.\nFollowing the Grenfell Tower Tragedy many leaseholders have become trapped with spiralling service charges which they cannot pay. I am therefore limiting service charge increases to inflation backdated to the date of the tragedy, and will refund landlords forced into loss by this, subject to reasonable limits on insurance premiums and other costs.\nIn summary Mr. Speaker I anticipate that for the coming year tax increases and expenditure savings with bring in around £80 billion and tax reductions and expenditure increases cost around £20 billion, giving my target net saving of £60 billion. I am also placing a five and ten year Source and Application of Funds Statement in the library and online. So now it just remains for me to I thank the House for their patience and attention during this speech. It is a budget for working people and small businesses combined with a strategy to save Britain, and I commend it to the House.",
  "https_jepoynton_com_/https_jepoynton_com_2015_07_29_the-july-2015-budget-what-osborne-got-right-what-he-got-wrong-and-what-he-should-have-done-but-didnt/content_38.html": "Well, he did not put it quite like that of course. What he did say was that the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has forecast the creation of 1 million new jobs over the next five years. What neither he nor the OBR added however is that, on the basis of current trends, we will by then have 2 million more new immigrants. Simply deducting one figure from the other shows how net unemployment will increase. And it won’t be the immigrants who are unemployed, though many will be working for scant wages as part of some board and lodging scam, thereby adding to wage compression for the rest of us. The young, the old and the disabled are all set to find jobs more difficult to find.\nHe also tells us that unemployment is down to 5.5%, but omits to include the thousands of people now classified as self-employed but who are not earning a penny, the thousands more sanctioned off benefits, and the many thousands in part time jobs who want full-time employment. It’s pure window-dressing. The real danger is that he believes his own propaganda, which in turn will lead to further mismanagement of the economy.\nBecause the other big mistake he makes is to treat welfare expenditure as fixed. It’s not. It’s cyclical. It goes up and down with unemployment. He tells us that “Britain is home to 1% of the world’s population; generates 4% of the world’s income; and yet pays out 7% of the world’s welfare spending”. Frankly that is precisely what I would expect in the middle of a recession.\nIn fact these figures simply don’t add up. If unemployment is really down to 5.5% then that is more than half-way through the cycle. Unemployment peaked at around 9%, and the lowest it has been historically was 3%, so that sets the middle at 6%; the point at which the cyclical deficit/surplus is nil and any remaining deficit is purely structural.\nHistorically the factor linking cyclical deficit to unemployment is around £25bn per percent of unemployment. I suspect this is now lower due to changes in the structure of income tax and benefits, so let’s take the factor as £20bn. 5.5% unemployment therefore means we now have a cyclical surplus of £10bn and a structural deficit of £85bn. That means £85bn of more austerity, yet he has announced only £37bn over the next five years and still predicts a balanced budget at the end of it. As I say, these figures simply don’t add up. What about the remaining £38bn?\nOf course my strong suspicion as noted above is that the unemployment figures are wrong. Let’s work it out the other way round. The £38bn must be cyclical deficit, which means unemployment must be just short of 8%. That sounds much more likely in the light of high levels of under-employment, both of employed and self-employed people, and of immigration. But of course it also means that unemployment has only fallen by one percent over the past five years, which is a terrible performance. No wonder he wants to cook the books!\nAnd then there is the news that average weekly earnings are rising by 3.3% per annum. What we are not told is how the rich are once again surging ahead at the expense of the poor.\nI shall write separately on welfare reform shortly, and in particular on the problems of breeding for benefits and in making work pay, but addressing the former is undoubtedly the main thing he has got right. With Tax Credits now costing some £30bn a year, and families on benefits breeding at roughly double the rate of families not on benefits, it was a matter of urgency to remove this perverse incentive. The benefits cap was a crude first attempt at it, but reducing entitlement to child benefits for new claimants is a more structural and focused approach. I still have problems both with the caps (which in my opinion should not impinge on market social rents or housing benefit) and in their impact on larger families who expanded before they started claiming, but the top priority here was to remove the perverse incentive to breed for benefits. Refinements can come later.\nSo in summary let’s make some lists:\n1) What he got right:-\na) Cutting tax credits, but only for new-born children.\nb) Reducing the benefits cap; but see reservations above and below,\nc) Introducing the Apprenticeship Levy,\nd) Stabilising business first-year capital allowances,\ne) Phasing out the bank levy: bashing the banks in the middle of a recession has only made it worse!\nf) Earn or learn,\ng) Transferring university maintenance grants to the loans system,\nh) Increasing the Minimum Wage – but he has not left business with enough to pay for it,\ni) Increase in Employers’ NI allowance – will go some way towards it, but not enough,\nj) Reductions in Inheritance Tax,\nk) Scrapping permanent non-dom status,\nl) Various measures against tax evasion\nm) Aligning the ESA WRAG allowance with JSA\nn) Committing to spending 2% of GDP on defence,\no) Funding for the Defence Medical Welfare Service and the Royal Commonwealth Ex-Services League.\n2) What he got wrong:-\na) Balance: the overall impact will be a reduction in consumer demand just when we need to keep unemployment falling. He cannot continue to rely solely on monetary policy to stimulate the economy (the Bank of England is already warning of the consequent financial instability) or house prices will distort still further and be subject to a major downwards correction when eventually we do build sufficient new houses and limit immigration. His cuts to tax credits should have been matched by tax cuts elsewhere (see note on regional policy below) which, because they would reduce unemployment still further, would be self-financing and thus still enable him to meet his deficit targets.\nb) Reducing the benefit clawback earnings disregards: this makes it even less likely that work will pay\nc) Reducing social rents and limiting housing benefit and LHA in various ways: this will undermine the supply of social housing just when we need much more, and squeeze lower paid workers out of more prosperous areas where their work is most needed. The idea he expressed that higher rents are fuelled by housing benefit is just plain false; the market rent is determined ultimately by supply and demand. Housing benefit is certainly a component of that demand, but unless you are just going to make people homeless it is an unavoidable one. I must say I was distinctly reminded of Ed Miliband and energy prices when I heard this! All tenants should pay rents at the market rate (the Rent Officer used to set the HB limits at around one third of the way up the rental range in each area – I don’t know if that is still the case but it makes sense to me) and the clawback tapers then ensure richer tenants pay what they can afford to pay. No need for complications such as his ‘pay to stay’ idea.\nd) Dividends: there was no need to muck about and make the taxation of these even more complicated. Dividends should simply be taxed at the shareholder’s marginal rate with no extra personal allowance, and a withholding tax credit of 25%. With corporation tax now below 20% the double taxation argument has less force. In any case it should be addressed by reducing business taxation, not shareholder taxation, since businesses themselves do not have votes. Business taxation is taxation without representation and undermines incentives to invest and improve productivity.\ne) Limiting public sector pay to 1%: pay should be determined by local staff turnover rates otherwise we could end up with severe staff shortages. Likewise there will be some areas where even 1% isn’t justified as staff turnover continues to be low.\nf) Building more roads to improve (allegedly) productivity. This will damage the environment and increase taxes. The correct answer is to reduce demand by limiting immigration.\ng) Introducing Help-to-Buy ISAs and removing higher rate interest allowability for Buy-to-Let landlords. These will only push up house prices still further. He should give the Bank of England the power to restrict mortgage availability on a local basis to keep house price inflation under control, to assuage the Bank’s fears for financial stability, and as an additional dimension to regional policy.\nh) Withdrawal of tax relief on pension contributions and the additional cost of government contributions into pension ISAs. He’s got it the wrong way round. Your pension is taxed when you receive it, so if you have to pay into it out of taxed income that amounts to double taxation. It also reduces the base level of investment upon which the fund can grow. I look forward to contributing to his Green Paper on this, and also as the Coalition made a right pig’s ear of reforming public sector pensions as well (see future post).\ni) Abolition of entitlement to housing benefit for 18 to 21 year olds. Many youngsters are desperate to escape dysfunctional or violent family homes before they can concentrate sensibly on their futures.\n3) What he should have done but didn’t:-\na) Start to hedge the National Debt (see my Election Address (para 5) and post on Pensions).\nb) Introduce post-code regional policy and reform of the Barnett Formula (ditto). This is by far the most efficient way of reducing unemployment, and with it the deficit, as it concentrates stimulation where unemployment is highest and therefore most responsive. It will also I believe prove far more effective in regionally balancing the economy than any of the supply-side measures he did announce. I have elsewhere proposed a supplementary personal allowance of £500 per 1% of local unemployment above a threshold of say 5%, though of course both factors can be adjusted to taste as you go along. The policy presupposes availability of some honest un- and under- employment figures, though estimates would be better than nothing.\nc) Cut business rates – see comments above about business taxes and funding the minimum wage, as well as funding the higher levels of training and supervision required by many youngsters entering work. Otherwise employers will simply go on recruiting immigrants instead (in fact they will anyway until immigration is restricted).\nd) Introduce the National Credit Card for private sector public services (post 25th February 2015),\ne) Relate the Universal Credit single adult living allowance, earnings disregards and clawback rates to the tax personal allowance in terms of fixed percentages, so as to produce a smooth transition from benefits to tax, at least for single adults, and to keep the living allowance at realistic levels, funded by a complete phasing out of the tax credits system. I also cannot see any reason why we have different clawback taper rates for different benefits. Make them all 50%.\nf) Fund the building of social housing required through 30-year borrowing. The mortgage repayments will fund the bond redemptions and interest payments, so it won’t add to the unfunded national debt. It’s what I call ‘clean debt’, ie debt which ‘washes its own face’; though there may be some upwards impact on housing benefit until house prices and unemployment fall.\ng) Introduce in law, both for the public sector and for publicly quoted companies, the Cheapest Competent Candidate procedure for executive recruitment and promotions (see future post shortly). This will create a much more open competitive market for executive talent, and probably much lower remuneration, thereby reducing the income range as well as costs.\nh) Build more medical schools and nursing colleges to eliminate the NHS’s dependence on immigrants.",
  "https_jepoynton_com_/https_jepoynton_com_2016_12_20_christmas-greetings-from-southall/content_65.html": "AN OCCASIONAL NEWSLETTER\nNo. 2 : December 2016\nDear Ealing Southall resident (and quite a number of others!),\nFestive greetings to you all. As before you are receiving this newsletter because we were in contact during the general election, possibly through the 38 Degrees organisation, or on some other occasion. If you would like to be removed from this circulation list please let me know.\nThe EU Referendum\n2016 has been an historic year with victory in the EU Referendum and a fabulous 40% result in favour of Leave for the London Borough of Ealing, for which I am happy to share credit with our comrades at the Bruges Group and Vote Leave as well as the sound common sense of the voters. All the more frustrating then to discover that surreptitiously the Cameron government deliberately set it up to be only advisory and discretionary. Thankfully his successor, Theresa May, has now secured a vote in Parliament which would appear to commit it to supporting the result, so the verdict of the Supreme Court could turn out to be irrelevant. We wait with baited breath.\nGerard Batten, UKIP’s Mr. Brexit and MEP for London, has put together a full briefing here. And if you haven’t already read his renowned FAQ’s on Brexit you can get them here. I have also put up some ideas on constitutional reform on our branch website here. Happy festive reading.\nProject Fear has nothing on reality\nOne of the more significant publications during the year was a book by Mervyn King, now Lord King and formerly Governor of the Bank of England from 2003 to 2013, entitled “The End of Alchemy” in which he traces the origins of both the banking crisis and the fall in growth to the massive international trade imbalances that have developed as a result of globalisation and free trade since the early 1990s. He makes it crystal clear that we must take trade deficits far more seriously than we have done in the past and ensure we eliminate our own.\nA trade deficit is rather like a gaping hole in the bottom of our economic barrel. Jobs and consumer demand are constantly flowing out of it. So far the Bank of England has been able to top up the barrel again with quantitative easing. This works by reducing interest rates and thereby persuading people to borrow their future earnings to spend today. But as Lord King points out, sooner or later tomorrow becomes today and further borrowing becomes impossible as people have to start repaying the money they borrowed yesterday. As he puts it, diminishing returns are setting in.\nRather more vividly, it surely does not require a degree in economics to see that if jobs continue to pour out through the trade deficit, and as QE becomes progressively ineffective, the result will be a massive increase in unemployment. The only solution is to eliminate our trade deficit, but the policies required to do that – devaluation, import tariffs, balanced migration and possibly even selective protectionism – are only available through Brexit. Of course I am only talking about protectionism here if it can be negotiated (after Brexit), like a sort of inverted free trade agreement (FTA), and it may not be necessary anyway, but we are in a strong position to do so.\nI include balanced migration in this list not for the usual argument that it is necessary to force employers to train up our youngsters and other vulnerable groups into employment, or to encourage them to invest in modern technology, valid though those points are, but that Keynesian management of demand, which has served us reasonably well since the war, becomes impossible without tight control of our borders. Right now the economy is overheating, but with the result that we are just sucking in yet more immigrants and imports rather than reducing levels of indigenous unemployment. The presumed indicator, inflation, is submerged in wage compression and therefore ineffective. Back in the 70’s we had stagflation, where any attempt to stimulate the economy just produced inflation. Margaret Thatcher’s union reforms put an end to that. Today we have staggration, where any attempt to stimulate the economy just sucks in yet more immigrants.\nYes I know the government are claiming unemployment is at its lowest levels for years, but they deceitfully and conveniently omit under-employment, including the many thousands who have been reclassified as self-employed, those in part-time employment who want full time jobs, and those who have been sanctioned off benefits for the flimsiest of reasons as part of austerity. The number of people on zero hours contracts has increased by 20% over the past year, indicating an expanding economy with a labour market so loose that employers can employ whoever they like however they like. Intervention and legislation will only push unemployment back up again. Employers have become so used to ministers pandering like prostitutes to them that their expectations have become totally unrealistic, and still they complain about shortages of skills. It will require a tough government committed to balanced migration to address these issues effectively.\nSofties are caught in a trap. If they stimulate the economy all that happens in that immigration goes up. If they restrain the economy all that happens is that unemployment goes up. Just like stagflation in the seventies, except with inflation replaced by immigration. In my last newsletter I indicated that George Osborne had brought in a budget that would mean a million more unemployed. I had assumed he and Theresa May would act to control immigration and that he would make further progress in reducing the fiscal deficit as he had forecast. I was wrong. So we are seeing a massive increase in immigration and no progress on the deficit instead.\nIf economic meltdown does occur then it could lead to social and political meltdown as well. Armageddon. UKIP stands as a bulwark for moderate, practical and balanced policies in the face of a possible rise in right-wing extremism. The British temperament has so far stood firm, but who is to say it will continue to do so if we don’t get a clean Brexit before 2020. Hopefully in that event we will just get a re-run of the referendum, but we must not be complacent that we can continue to hold the tide against a rise of the sort of fascist parties we now see coming to the fore on the continent. Societies under pressure polarise. Frustrated people get angry.\nOne point on which Remainians are right, albeit accidentally, is that economic conditions will continue to be difficult in the immediate aftermath of Brexit. We will have to absorb inflation caused by devaluation, import tariffs and wage rises in order to achieve balanced trade and balanced migration, reducing living standards a bit more and perhaps also requiring some rise in unemployment, before we can confidently put our foot back on the accelerator. I see Brexit in the same light as El Alamein, of which Churchill famously said “This not the end of the war. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it may just be the end of the beginning”. Not exactly “blood, sweat and tears”, but similarly requiring true British patience and grit to see us through. Never forget that the bulk of the establishment in 1940 wanted Halifax as Prime Minister. Halifax wanted ‘to get the best deal’ with Hitler, a sort of ‘soft’ Third Reich you could say. Thankfully we never found out how that would have played out. And no, I am not equating the EU with the Third Reich!\nYou can find more in my article “There is no such thing as a soft Brexit” on our branch website.\nThe Free Trade fanatics are out in force – on both sides!\nValuable as Lord King’s book is as an historical narrative and analysis, he comes off the rails with his prognosis in which he recommends yet more free trade. I have dealt with this issue more fully in my personal blog article entitled “Do I believe in Free Trade?” which I hope you will read.\nEssentially the classical arguments in favour of free trade, which revolve around increased competition, economies of scale and specialisation, no longer hold true. The practice of offshoring has undermined them. Not only are multinational corporations now offshoring production (farewell economies of scale) but they are also offshoring know-how in the form of R&D and design (farewell specialisation). And if that weren’t bad enough they are offshoring their profits as well, leaving their host nations with nothing.\nWhat we are seeing now is not so much the creation of new wealth but a massive transfer of existing wealth to third world countries as a result of globalisation and unbalanced free trade. Of course it is wonderful that we can now anticipate the ending of global food poverty by 2030, and that millions have been lifted out of poverty in China and elsewhere, or that global population is now expected to peak at under 11 billion before the end of the century. Anybody who predicted these things 30 years ago would have been carted off by the men in white coats. But let us not kid ourselves that most of this is not at the expense of the western working classes. The real twist of the knife though comes because the Remainian (“I’m all right, Jack”) middle-class establishment has protected itself with a widening pay gap, leaving the burden to be carried just by the lower income groups. No wonder they are now fed up with both the burden and the injustice of it.\nThere is no harm at all in putting in place a mirror image of the EU’s customs tariffs for ourselves. The rest of the world already pays these tariffs (to Brussels) whilst we desperately need the EU countries to start paying them to reduce our trade deficit with them. They can hardly complain when they are charging the same to us. The £25bn or so of tariff income will be a bonus.\nWe must also beware the queue of other countries lining up to secure trade deals with us. They will get the benefit of no longer paying these tariffs, but what do we get? The danger is that our deficit will get even bigger. Brexit first, put our own tariffs in place with it, and only then consider deals. It could be done within weeks – no more uncertainty and a much clearer negotiating position. I have nothing against free trade per se, but balance must come first.\nIt is interesting that Donald Trump appears to have a much better understanding of this than we do over here. But then he is a businessman. Successful businessmen know they have to be honest else their customers do not return and their suppliers become unreliable. Politicians are not subject to such discipline.\nI first wrote about this under the heading “Greece, the Eurozone and World Trade” early last year. You might also like “Why the Single Market is a Bad Idea”.\nThe IFS contradicts itself.\nOn a lighter note I was delighted to see the experts have managed to get their knickers in a twist over productivity and standards of living. But have a look first at my chart which I drew up before the referendum and which is based directly on ONS figures. It shows that our average real standard of living is now 30% lower than it was at the end of the eighties.\nBack in July the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) published a report entitled “Living standards, poverty and inequality in the UK: 2016” which nobody took much notice of. It concluded that “median income had risen to above the previous peak reached in 2009-10, and is 2.2% above the pre-recession level in 2007-08.” But just as the Autumn Statement was being delivered last month, they published another report (not that I have been able to find it on their website – it may just have been a quote from their director Paul Johnson, and other commentators have attributed it to the IMF or the Resolution Foundation – but let’s just take it as it was reported in the press and on Question Time on 24th November) saying “This has, for sure, been the worst decade for living standards certainly since the last war and probably since the 1920s”.\nClearly one of these two reports must be wrong. No prizes for guessing which! The latter report also referred to the period since 2008, thereby implying the cause as being the banking crisis. That is wrong too. As explained above the cause is globalisation and unbalanced free trade.\nThere is no need for austerity\nTalking of the Autumn Statement, Philip Hammond is clearly just as terrified of the fiscal deficit as George Osborne was, and has embarked on a programme of austerity to match that of his predecessor. He did not put it that way of course. He quoted the Office for Budget Responsibility’s forecasts that the deficit would reduce to £17.2bn by 2021/2, from £68.2bn now, which would represent 0.7% GDP, which he trumpeted would be the lowest in two decades. But not only did he fail to spell out exactly how this would be achieved, he also noted that the OBR itself says the forecasts involve a high degree of uncertainty, and goes on to anticipate a falling rate of economic growth. There is only one way those figures can be made consistent with each other, and that is through massive austerity.\nBut you know, there is no need. Here is how we can avoid it while still balancing the books.\nLocal Issues\nMy colleagues keep telling me to write more on local issues. Of course I could give you a long list of Labour’s failings in Ealing, but that would not be in the Christmas spirit. A more serious point though is that there is only a very limited amount any party can do at the local level while austerity is being imposed from Westminster. So the best news for Ealing would be a UKIP government in Westminster.\nWell I hope your definition of festive will extend to all of the above!\nWishing you a Happy Christmas and Prosperous Clean Brexit,\nJohn Poynton\nUKIP Ealing (a notch or two above Lower Slaughter!?)\nUKIP Ealing Southall PPC.\nukipealing.com and jepoynton.com",
  "https_jepoynton_com_/https_jepoynton_com_2019_05_24_abortion/content_29.html": "During the euro election campaign, as a candidate I have received over 400 identical emails asking whether I would support EU spending or other influences to persuade either EU member states or other countries to legalise abortion. I sent out a response saying that as a libertarian I am pro-choice but that does not mean I would support any EU spending or policies to interfere with the internal democracies of such countries.\nInterestingly I did not receive any emails on any other subject. Perhaps others realised that at number seven on the London list there was no hope of me becoming an MEP! However I did get around a dozen responses to mine which to my surprise represented a wide range of views, and certainly not all of them based on religious beliefs. One of the latest read as follows:\nThanks for your response which I appreciate. Whilst I suspect you have thought this through, your response seems to indicate you think pro-choice is the only position consistent with libertarianism? I would also consider myself such, but think the exact opposite. If you do have the time, I would be interested to know why you think this.\nBest wishes\nA****\nso I thought I would share my response to him with you which was as follows:\nDear A****\nThanks so much for your reply. I have received over 400 identical emails on this, but it is only when someone replies to one of my admittedly identical responses that it comes alive and we can have an interesting discussion.\nThe first point I would make, as I am sure you will have realised but just to be sure, pro-choice does not mean pro-abortion. Abortion must be a horrible experience for any woman and I would not wish it on anyone. I have been told that some children survive abortion with horrible consequences, that the foetus can experience pain at earlier than 24 weeks, and that many women, especially children, are hounded into a decision without the benefit of full and independent advice, though whether these things happen at professional clinics was not made clear. Clearly the law needs to be tightened up if they do, but that is surely more easily done if abortion is legal.\nNo, my first question is to ask if there is any over-riding national interest in establishing uniformity across the land. I do not see one, and therefore believe a free society should allow the matter to be left to individual discretion either way. After all, the individual facing such a decision can have a far better understanding of the circumstances and consequences involved than a general and remote law can possibly do. What do you say to the woman who is both well informed and clear that she does want an abortion? Why should others have any right to impose views on her she does not share if they are not themselves involved?\nWhich brings us to religion. Many of my correspondents have had strong religious views which I fully respect but do not share. That of course puts me at a disadvantage, but I do still want to address the question of rights of the unborn child. It seems clear to me that rights are a man-made legal construct, determined for all of us by Parliament, and therefore cannot pre-exist. Of course we can choose the give the foetus rights, but that is a decision for the majority who then face a question of priorities over maintaining a free society. I would ask how far back do you go? What about the unfertilized egg? It all gets very subjective and impractical. I am therefore happy to stick to the current practical and , I think, reasonably balanced arrangements. Ultimately it is a matter for a free vote in Parliament.\nWith best wishes,\nJohn.",
  "https_jepoynton_com_/https_jepoynton_com_tag_economics/content_2.html": "Mr. Speaker, it is an honour and a privilege for me to have this opportunity to present to the House the government’s budget for the coming year.\nAs the House will already know, our economy and government finances are in a desperate and sorry state. Over the past nearly 25 years we have suffered a series of setbacks that have enveloped us in a perfect storm, starting with our membership of the European Union Single Market which has seen our trade balance with those countries plummet from having been broadly in balance to a deficit at the time of the Brexit Referendum of £109 billion; that’s 6% of GDP at that time. This has presented British business with a contracting market. Generally speaking business will not invest into a contracting market, with the result that productivity growth has suffered.\nThen we had the banking crisis, triggered by an oil price spike in 2007 which led to the default of many sub-prime mortgages in the USA and which our banks had invested into. But there were also collapses on this side of the pond such as Northern Rock and HBOS which were simply due to over-trading, and that can only be due to a failure of regulation here. One bright spot then arises as the banks were quickly recapitalised through the use of quantitative easing, which did not on that occasion produce inflation as it was merely replacing credit which had been destroyed in the crisis. Unfortunately later on the QE was restarted with inevitable inflationary consequences.\nOn top of all that we had austerity and the failure to start a Sovereign Wealth Fund when interest rates hit the floor. Mr. Speaker, I am sure that most members are aware that 5% compounded will quadruple your money within 30 years, and 7% double it within ten. Over the past thirty years returns on many foreign shares have been far greater than the cost of government borrowing here. That is because the rate of growth in many other countries has been far faster than it has been here and is likely to continue that way for some time to come. It must make sense for us to benefit from their success in this way. A golden opportunity completely missed.\nThen we come to Brexit which some today are blaming for all our financial woes. Mr. Speaker, I do not accept that analysis but instead that the Trade and Co-operation Agreement has locked us into the catastrophic trade deficit we inherited from the Single Market. It is not enough to secure no tariffs in either direction when there are a host of other regulations creating the imbalance, and we need the use of tariffs to counter that effect. That will almost certainly mean scrapping the TCA, and whilst trade volumes may fall, the much greater effect of import substitution will present British business at home with the expanding market they crave to invest and create productivity growth and jobs.\nFollowing that we had Covid and the energy crisis caused by the war in Ukraine, thankfully temporarily as Russia has found other outlets into the international oil markets, and all of the panic over climate change. And if that weren’t enough mass immigration, quite apart from increasing cultural conflict within the country, has condemned wages to minimum levels, undermined working conditions and caused record levels of unemployment and homelessness. And to cap it all, we have an ageing population pushing the cost of pensions and health care through the roof. Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear!\nNow, Mr. Speaker, it is not my intention to spend time trying to apportion blame for this situation. Many of these circumstances were beyond our control, and for others it is easy to be wise after the event. My purpose is to identify the causes so we can take appropriate action to remedy them and to quantify the task itself. Our National Debt is now close to 100% of GDP after having been nearly paid off a quarter of a century ago, and the cost of interest on that debt is now over £100 billion a year, nearly 4% GDP in itself, and rising. The total fiscal deficit is around £170 billion and that is adding to the Debt all the time. It is imperative, Mr. Speaker, that we get our nose ahead of the game so that we can reverse the whole process.\nMy strategy is based on three key objectives necessary to provide a tripod of stability for our recovery. First I aim to achieve a fiscal surplus of 1% GDP within five years. Second I want a trade surplus of 1% GDP by that time, and third we must achieve net zero immigration as well. Add to that some essential tax cuts to motivate growth and expenditure increases to avoid imminent collapse of some public services and we are looking at an annual fiscal turnaround of £300 billion by the end of our first five years.\nOn average I must save £60 billion in each of the next five years, but that is only on average. There are couple of policies which can raise substantial funds in excess of this amount up front, while others such as revived economic growth will be weighted towards the end. The good news is that over the following five years those trends should lead to a much greater turnaround of around £450 billion or more, with much greater scope for both tax cuts and expenditure increases, which I shall aim broadly to keep equal. I shall also aim to cut the total level of taxation down to 30% GDP, whereas currently it is around 37%, all the while maintaining fiscal and trade surpluses of 1% GDP. History shows that all the economies with the highest rates of economic growth have run Balance of Payments surpluses and I am determined the UK should be in that group.\nSo, Mr. Speaker, let me make a start.\nMy first port of call is multinational corporations, which have long had a habit of shifting their profits into tax havens, or semi tax havens such as the Republic of Ireland, to avoid corporation tax in this country. Now I accept that at 25% our rate of corporation tax is too high, and I shall return to that later, but for now may I completely reject the argument that this country must somehow engage in a race to bottom just to remain competitive. There are other ways we can regulate our trade balance, and in any case if were able to collect what is morally due to us, profits made out purchases by the good citizens of this country, that would provide the funds to reduce it.\nOver ten years ago now, the G8 at its summit in Enniskillen tasked the OECD with ending this practice. They have completely failed to do so and show no signs of any significant progress as they just kick the can further on down the road. Clearly the multinationals have got to them! We cannot afford to wait any longer.\nThe good news is that this is very easy to rectify. Henceforth multinationals, which we shall define as any company that has more than 10% of its turnover in more than one country, shall be taxed on the basis of their global profits, as declared to their shareholders and in the public domain, and apportioned to this country by turnover, including non-domestic intercompany sales. They may be able to shift their head offices and their intellectual property rights, but they cannot shift their customers! It is difficult to forecast accurately without an established database exactly how much additional revenue this will raise, but our best estimates suggest it could be within the range of £40 to 50 billion if not more.\nSecond, Mr. Speaker, I am abolishing Inheritance Tax. It is a very inefficient tax, raising only about a third of 1% GDP; is double taxation in the hands of the deceased; uses up a disproportionate amount of tax legislation and consequently distracts the attention of thousands of lawyers and accountants who should be more constructively engaged.\nHowever I recognise that a society in which around 2% of the population own 80% of its assets is not a healthy one. I want to reduce this wealth gap but not eliminate it. It remains important that those with energy, ability and enterprise can profit from them for the benefit of us all. In practice however much of this accumulated wealth is passive asset appreciation.\nI therefore aim to raise about 2% GDP by charging legacies to capital gains tax in the hands of beneficiaries. This would require a 50% withholding tax to counter avoidance, but which would be repaid, with interest, when the gains are presented for assessment. I do not propose to introduce a wealth tax, which would also be double taxation in the hands of the taxpayer as well as very difficult to collect as much of it would disappear into overseas trusts and corporate structures.\nCapital gains will be assessed to income tax at the taxpayer’s marginal rate with no additional allowances. However I am allowing it to be spread over ten years so that poorer beneficiaries can use up more of their allowances and lower rate bands. This reflects the rule-of-thumb PE ratio of 10 often used to value small companies.\nExisting roll-over reliefs from inheritance tax such as for farms and businesses will be maintained and I am adding relief for the repayment of any student loans, not necessarily those of the taxpayer. Tax on occupied primary residences, again not necessarily by the taxpayer or his family, such as a sitting tenant, may be deferred until that occupant leaves.\nI am also abolishing Non-Dom status, but replacing it with a flat cap on income tax, including capital gains, of £250,000 in any one year.\nThese two changes alone should raise around £80 billion a year. I am not seeking to raise any other taxes. I am however reintroducing marginal relief from corporation tax for small businesses with a zero rate allowance of one million and a lower rate band of two million. The lower rate will be half the full rate which remains at 25%. In the longer term I aim to reduce taxation to 30% GDP and increase the personal tax allowance to match the typical minimum wage at £20,000, and reduce the top rate to 40%. I may also introduce an intermediate rate at 30%.\nMr. Speaker I now come to a series of changes focused on reducing the burden on the taxpayer without endangering essential public services by focusing on efficiency and alternative sources of finance.\nBetter late than never I am introducing a Sovereign Wealth Fund which will be funded by borrowing at an interest rate not greater than 5% and at an amount, if available in the gilts markets, of 1% GDP a year. The asset will offset the liability and therefore have no effect on net debt. This will be farmed out to multiple professional fund managers with after time the more successful attracting greater contributions.\nIn addition I am starting the funding of a new state pension. This necessarily must be a gradual and prolonged process which will not have any significant effect on the public finances for many years. It will be available only to those under the age of 25 on 6th April next year and will be optional. Modelling suggests it will primarily benefit those on above average salaries, thereby halving in due course the number in the existing state pension. This in turn may allow us to improve the existing state pension significantly. For those who opt in, the existing employee national insurance contribution of 8% becomes a national pension contribution and is placed in an account in their name to which a guaranteed 4% interest as added annually. Of the three parameters of contribution rate, retirement age and pension amount, they will have the flexibility to fix any two and get a quote for the third. They may opt in or change these parameters at a later date, subject to not reducing the pension to an annuity equivalent below the level that would trigger entitlement to pension credits, and their remaining entitlement to the existing state pension will be determined by the number of years’ contributions in the existing way. This will create a fully flexible and transferable pension scheme which is currently unavailable to many, including those who switch employment between the public and private sectors. The money will physically go into the Sovereign Wealth Fund, which should get a better return for carrying risk, and will be part of its 1% GDP per annum funding target.\nMr. Speaker I am also introducing a National Credit Card. The purpose of the card is to give all citizens access to the private sector for essential services such as health and education on a means-tested basis. Just taking the health and schools budgets alone costs the taxpayer around £250 billion a year. If 50% used the private sector instead, and the average means-tested support for fees was also 50%, then the saving to the taxpayer would be over £60 billion a year.\nWe shall have to introduce this gradually to enable the supply side to meet increasing demand and it will be optional. Users pay for services in the normal way but do not have to settle the card at the end of the month. Instead after the end of the year when the taxman assesses your tax he will also review how much you have spent on your card, put the two together and recharge your share of the cost to your tax bill for the following year. Working capital will come from the Sovereign Wealth Fund at 5% which will be added to your costs from the date of purchase, but users will be able to pay on account to avoid it. The means test rate will be a simple percentage set at the beginning of each fiscal year for each user set in due course to encourage 50% usage. Much of these savings will then be available to improve the state services, and the fact that the private sector is accessible to all will remove any stain of privilege that some attribute to it at present.\nMr. Speaker, with the help of my RH colleagues I am taking a number of measures to improve efficiency within our public services. First we shall be splitting the civil service clean in two so that the advisory side, which advises ministers on current problems and future legislation, becomes completely separate and independent from the executive side, which delivers services mandated by Parliament. Two completely separate functions requiring separate organisational structures. This way the advisory side can assist ministers in holding the executive side to account.\nSecond we shall be appointing a national chief executive with the power to hire and fire local chief executives for every national public service. It is an extraordinary fact that currently few if any of our public services actually have any top management at all. No wonder they are all running around like headless chickens being hopelessly inefficient.\nThese chief executives will be mandated to ensure that sufficient trained British staff are recruited into each service, that they are paid the rate for the job so that staff turnover rates are minimised, and that agency and support staff are reduced to less than 25% of payroll each. I am also allowing staff bonuses to be paid out of 10% of any local budget savings or collected charges.\nThird, I am abolishing national wage bargaining in the tax funded public sector. Henceforth all such staff will be paid a full inflationary increase on 1st April each year. I reject the argument that this will create an inflationary wage spiral on the grounds both that there are no prices in this sector and that inflation increases the tax base anyway. But it is also important for staffing stability that all staff are paid the rate for the job, which will vary by skill and location across the country with additional increases awarded locally and which therefore cannot be addressed on a national basis.\nThese measures taken together could save another £30 billion a year as well as ensure they are no longer dependent on immigration for staff.\nSpeaking of immigration, my RH friend the Home Secretary will be scrapping the current points-based system and replacing it with an auctioned reducing quota system so that total immigration is reduced to below emigration rates within five years. It is therefore vital that we are able to reduce unemployment at the same or faster rate. Indeed we currently have over 3% job vacancies across our economy which is roughly double historical norms and only serves to suck in yet more immigrants. I shall therefore be instructing the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee henceforth to use a composite 4% target when setting interest rates; that is 2% inflation plus 2% job vacancies. I anticipate this will mean interest rates will remain at around the 5% mark for the foreseeable future, which is necessary anyway to encourage savings and fund investment, and will also probably be needed to contain the inflationary impact of wage rises in a tighter labour market. I shall be addressing the housing market separately in a few moments.\nIn addition I have a new regional policy designed to reduce the regional pay and unemployment gaps. It must make sense to focus stimulation to where unemployment is highest post code by post code across the country leading eventually to an even level of percentage employment across the land. This will increase income tax revenues and reduce welfare claims so it is likely to be fiscally neutral in the longer term.\nTo do so I shall cease funding new free tax and enterprise zones, which have a very chequered and uneven history, and instead introduce discounts for income tax, business rates and employers national insurance where the discount is proportionate to the local level of unemployment. For the coming year this discount will be 5% for every 1% that unemployment, measured on the claimant basis, is above 5%. We will review this algorithm annually to ensure a steady reduction in the regional gap.\nI also have a number of measures to free up the labour market to reduce structural unemployment. First I am repealing all IR35 legislation, which was designed to prevent employers avoiding the cost of national insurance contributions on permanent staff, by the simple measure of charging the invoices of self-employed and agency staff to NICs also. Professional fees will be exempt. The increased revenues will be used to reduce employers NICs for all so that the measure is fiscally neutral.\nIn any case I am immediately reducing employers NICs to 12% and increasing the minimum wage and universal credits in line with the triple lock on the state pension. I am also introducing marginal relief for employers NI with a zero alowance of £1000 per week of payroll, and a lower band of £2000 at a rate of half the full rate.\nSecond my RH friend the Work and Pensions Secretary will be undertaking a full post-implementation review of the introduction of Universal Credits with a view to making it simpler and more streamlined and efficient. In particular he will ensure that the thresholds for and rates of clawback are also universal, and that once vetted claimants do not have to reapply every time they get a gap between jobs. This is particularly important for self-employed people who currently often decline short term or low paid assignments because of the hassle and delays in reapplying.\nWithin this context I am increasing the threshold, or earnings disregard, for clawback of universal credits to £50 per week. This will create a much greater incentive for unemployed people to make that first leap back into employment, and will also allow low paid workers in the taper to keep more of what they themselves have earned. This will both reduce the poverty trap and the pressure on food banks many of which are struggling to obtain sufficient supplies.\nMr. Speaker, I now turn to support for farmers and care homes. At first sight they do not have much in common but they are both essential to our wellbeing, are competitive within the private sector and yet need financial support if they are to produce both food and care at affordable levels and remain profitable. Furthermore farmers are in competition with foreign imports which are heavily subsidised.\nFor both industries I am introducing a public subsidy at 10% on turnover. This will be subject to a profit cap at 5% before tax to prevent profiteering by larger businesses at the expense of both taxpayer and customer. The subsidy is designed to promote sales, and the profit cap will encourage competitive pricing and support greater expenditure. Qualifying directors remuneration will be restricted. In future years the rate of subsidy will be adjusted so that no more than 5% of businesses liquidate each year.\nMany businesses in a variety of industries receive public subsidies and there has been much concern at their profits. I am therefore extending the profit cap to all entities in receipt of public subsidy, though the cap may vary according to their capital investment requirements. I am also extending it proportionately to all companies with contracts with the public sector worth annually over 10% of their turnover.\nFinally Mr. Speaker I come to the housing market. I shall be reducing house prices from now on by between 1 and 2% a year on average. This is easily done by giving the Bank of England that target and by tightening criteria such as mortgage to value and income to mortgage used by commercial lenders.\nNow you may at first sight think that would make it more difficult for prospective purchasers to find and buy a new house, but in fact that is not so. For one thing the number of available houses out there does not change, and for another the supply is likely to increase because sellers will hurry to sell before prices reduce further. More importantly developers will no longer be able to make capital gains on their land banks and so can only build houses on them and sell them. In monetary terms the reduction in demand will be matched by a reduction is prices until all available houses are sold.\nThe misconstrued Help to Buy policy has just made matters worse, so I am in effect reversing it. Last year fewer new houses were built than before the policy was introduced over ten years ago and it has just pushed house prices even higher. Irrespective of whether we can balance supply and demand, the amount of credit tied up in the housing market means that house prices are likely to remain high. Yet house prices must come down if younger people are to buy when they get married and start a family and others to escape the parental nest and develop as independent adults.\nCurrently it takes on average over five years to build out a granted planning consent whereas no so long ago it was only two. It has been reported that there are hundreds of thousands of such consents gathering dust in the pending trays of property developers because they can make more money from capital gains. But it is important to understand also that they have themselves been squeezed by increasing land prices. As a result they have endeavoured to recoup their margins by resorting to dodgy practices such as denying buyers adequate snagging periods and tying them up into leaseholds with uncontrollable ground rent increases, and generally cutting costs and building to very low standards. Many such properties are now unsaleable. Mr. Speaker I am giving Help to Buy purchasers a new six month snagging period, with a survey at taxpayer’s expense to ensure objectivity, and with all restitution costs at the sellers expense.\nMy RH friend the Secretary of State for Housing, will be carrying out a full review of planning and related procedures including the possible repeal of the 1961 Land Compensation Act which gives 100% of all planning gain to landowners. We believe it may be more appropriate to divide planning gain equally between landowners, a national development corporation with powers of compulsory purchase to focus new development in the North where there are plentiful brownfield sites available, supported by regional policy which will encourage both people and jobs to move there, and local development corporations who can use the money for local infrastructure thereby creating balanced communities. The South East is overcrowded and current development priorities just make that worse. They are levelling down not levelling up. We will protect and maintain the green belt.\nOn social housing I am restoring the full housing benefit which will become affordable again as immigration falls. This will allow housing associations access to the City for development finance, and I shall be adding a government guarantee to help reduce borrowing costs. We will continue to support Right to Buy as it does not reduce total housing available but I am halving the discounts.\nFollowing the Grenfell Tower Tragedy many leaseholders have become trapped with spiralling service charges which they cannot pay. I am therefore limiting service charge increases to inflation backdated to the date of the tragedy, and will refund landlords forced into loss by this, subject to reasonable limits on insurance premiums and other costs.\nIn summary Mr. Speaker I anticipate that for the coming year tax increases and expenditure savings with bring in around £80 billion and tax reductions and expenditure increases cost around £20 billion, giving my target net saving of £60 billion. I am also placing a five and ten year Source and Application of Funds Statement in the library and online. So now it just remains for me to I thank the House for their patience and attention during this speech. It is a budget for working people and small businesses combined with a strategy to save Britain, and I commend it to the House.",
  "https_jepoynton_com_/https_jepoynton_com_2015_03_06_housing-regional-policy-and-the-dis-economies-of-devolution/content_25.html": "The one thing we shouldn’t be worrying about over the provision of social housing is funding. With interest rates on the floor it is a simple matter to raise the funds required through the issue of 30 year gilts, currently costing less than 3% pa, and transfer those funds on to the Housing Corporation in the form of 30 year mortgages. The Housing Corporation in turn would pass the funds on again over perhaps 25 years to housing associations, local authorities or indeed anyone else wanting to build and rent social housing. This way the capital is fully repaid by the time the gilts mature, and the quarterly repayments can be used partly to pay the interest and partly to invest in a repayment wealth fund. With rents at the levels they currently are it should be easy to make the finance work, and of course any strain would be taken by housing benefit. That in turn will reduce as unemployment falls. Important of course that rents are set at market levels for this to work.\nEncouraging private landlords into social housing is just as important. Historically private landlords have avoided social housing like the plague, as they regard the whole system as hopelessly unreliable. I remember once ringing round six different estate agents in Oxford to find private social housing for someone, and every single one of them said ‘no’. Three said it was a matter of company policy, and the others admitted they did not trust the system. And I can see why. Benefits officials tend to shoot first and ask questions later, leaving the claimant unexpectedly stranded, even though there may be nothing wrong with their claim. On top of that we now have the Coalition proposing an end to direct payments. One of the things I remember from my time as Finance Director at PCHA is how much time our housing officers had to spend with tenants just helping them with simple domestic budgeting. Direct payments were often key to getting the rent paid on time.\nTo overcome this, and hugely to increase private sector investment into social housing, I propose the setting up of a Landlords’ Guarantees Agency. In return for a small commission off the rent, sufficient to fund the agency’s costs, the agency would offer landlords charging a social rent guaranteed payment of that rent, less commission, on the nail in advance every month. The agency would then collect the rent from the tenant which, with all the powers of the state behind it, it would be in a much stronger position to do. The arrangement could also benefit the tenants since if necessary the agency could press the landlord to fulfill his own obligations under the tenancy agreement, such as for maintenance for example. It would provide protection from rogue operators on both sides of the fence.\nI also propose the introduction of a flat rate benefit for the homeless. Perhaps at a rate of £100 pw or thereabouts, this would allow people who are entitled to housing benefit but who cannot actually claim it, because there is insufficient social housing available and who therefore quite literally end up on the streets, to take the initiative to sort themselves out. Their ‘demand’ would encourage the charitable or private sector provision of hostels or they could find lodgings, though what they actually do with the money would be entirely up to them. This way the most vulnerable of all in our society would no longer be caught up in the dependency culture the current system creates through having to wait for some bureaucrat to fall out of bed the right side that morning. They can get on with it themselves. The cost would be nothing, as the money is already mandated in the form of housing benefit.\nUKIP have quite rightly said that all new housing must be built on brown-field sites, and that the starting point will be to set up a register of where they all are. I was relieved to hear that about one third of these are thought to be in the South East, where presumably most of the homeless are, but it is not something to leave to chance. Essentially the aim must be to build the houses where the brownfield sites are, and then to create the jobs where the houses are. This requires an effective and structural regional policy.\nThis is not the only reason we need such a policy. Regional imbalance is also an impediment to reducing unemployment, as well as a factor in dealing with devolution and the Barnett formula.\nRegional policy has never been successful in this country, and the reason I believe is that it has always been applied to the supply side of the economy. Stimulating the economy, which is essentially a matter of increasing consumer demand, given that investment follows demand, is like trying to move a piece of string lengthways. If you push it (supply side) it will just crumple. To get the whole thing to move you have to pull it (demand side). This became obvious in the late 1980’s. The relatively rapid recovery of the economy in the early eighties was caused by the removal of credit restrictions so that people started to chase up house prices by increasing their mortgage borrowing. When on top of this Nigel Lawson then cut taxes in his 1987 budget people used the extra money to jack up their mortgages even further and the boom just took off. I suspect this memory inspired George Osborne’s Help-to-Buy policy, which indeed has had some success. So it works at the national level; it just remains to apply the same principles at the regional level. It also chimes with UKIP’s policy of lower taxation.\nI propose therefore that a second personal allowance be introduced into the income tax system, applied on a local post-code basis and related to local levels of unemployment, and perhaps also to housing availability, by an appropriate formula, so that people living in areas of higher unemployment would pay less tax for a given income than those living in areas of lower unemployment. I am sure this would go down very well in places such as Clacton, Rochester and Margate! It would regenerate local communities from within, which is by far the best way to do it.\nI also advocate the setting up of a chain of Local Community Banks, on the German model but owned by the Bank of England, to take in deposits and lend them on to local small and medium-sized businesses (SME’s). They would not get involved in payment clearing or mortgages in any way and would not therefore replace the clearing banks. But they would allow lending criteria to be skewed in favour of areas of higher unemployment, a sort of localised quantitative easing (QE) if you like, whilst keeping its overall lending book balanced.\nThese policies would have the effect of creating a much more even level of percentage employment across the land, which in turn would enable average unemployment to be reduced much further before London and the South East trigger inflation. This is essential not only to deal with housing mismatch but also to reduce the deficit. As I have said elsewhere, UKIP can eliminate the deficit entirely by reducing unemployment by between 4 and 5% because for every one percent reduction in unemployment the deficit reduces by between 20 and £25bn. However there are a number of impediments to reducing unemployment this much. The first of course is immigration, but regional policy comes a close second. Both are required, and I would argue also for a big increase in the welfare earnings disregards in order to ‘make work pay’, something Universal Credits does not appear designed to achieve, but that is really a separate subject.\nA separate regional policy will enable us to lift regional considerations out of issues such as HS2 and devolution. UKIP has of course committed to abolishing HS2 anyway, but the argument that regional policy is dealt with separately adds further grist to the mill. Devolution is a more interesting matter.\nMany of you may remember the old rating system that used to exist in London whereby it was always the poorest boroughs that charged the highest rates. Margaret Thatcher always argued that this was due to their profligate loony-left policies and there may well have been an element of that, but the principle reason surely must have been that they had fewer taxpayers and higher costs. Although there was supposed to have been a redistributive balancing formula, it never seemed to work.\nAll public expenditure, with the possible exception of transport which is largely user financed, involves a transfer of wealth from rich to poor. Our progressive tax system is based on this principle, as is the principle of allocating expenditure according to need. A moment’s reflection will indicate that this will only work if both taxpayers and recipients are all in the same pot. If you compartmentalise the pot then you are likely to end up with most of the rich in one compartment and most of the poor in another, and the transfer mechanism is broken.\nThere is also the question of where you locate expensive and scarce facilities. You may not be able to afford to supply one for each pot, or there may be insufficient demand to justify one for each smaller pot. In the case of Aisha King’s cancer treatment the NHS could not afford the required machine at all and he had to go Prague, which was of course private sector and therefore available to anyone across the globe. This is what I call the Dis-economies of Devolution.\nMuch of the upsurge in popularity for the SNP is I am sure due to the recession; what the medical profession calls a ‘referred pain’. It is illogical to suppose that if you are independent then that somehow gives you access to more funds or that you could use them more efficiently. Almost certainly that is not the case for Scotland, both because I suspect that a disproportionate number of higher-rate taxpayers live south of the border (not an issue that was discussed at all during the referendum campaign as I recall) and because the referendum has now highlighted the fact that Scots receive more public funding per head, about £1,500pa as I recall, than the English.\nDevolution means we can no longer allocate expenditure according to need (the management mechanisms necessary to do this are now entirely missing anyway) and it follows we must go for a ‘fair’ equal allocation of funds per head instead. Of course the Scottish government can always add their own layer of taxation to make up the shortfall (which probably will be less than popular!), but what they can’t do is subtract from UK taxation. UKIP is committed to revising the Barnett formula onto this basis, though my proposed tax-based regional policy would go some way towards redressing the balance on an equally fair basis.",
  "https_jepoynton_com_/https_jepoynton_com_2015_03_18_why-the-tories-are-wrong-on-the-economy/content_58.html": "Recent History\nGordon Brown notoriously claimed that he had ended boom and bust – just before the banking crisis inflicted the deepest recession on us since the Great Depression. But I am not going to sit here just to take pot shots at him, because I too was beginning to develop some confidence that we had cracked the challenge of macroeconomic management. What caught us both out was the emergence of a separate global economic cycle triggered by spikes and troughs in the oil price, which proved to be, and still is, out of phase with our domestic cycle. I am of course overlooking here the additional regulatory failures on both sides of the pond.\nThat was Keynes’s view too, though as it turned out matters were not so simple in the 1930s either. Keynes’s solution was public works, and it did indeed have some success at first because to ‘dig a hole’ in those days required huge teams of navvies all wielding picks and shovels. They had to be paid of course, and it was the spending of those wages that increased local consumer demand and helped to regenerate the local economy. Nowadays such a project would be carried out by one man and a JCB, so the effect is not the same. As Jim Callaghan succinctly put it in 1979, you cannot spend your way out of a recession.\nKeynes has also been criticised for the assumptions behind his famous book The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money. Classical theory held that supply would create its own demand; in other words if you had a given supply of a commodity, be it fish on the quayside or hours of labour, then if you price it correctly you will just be able to sell it all. He expected to see unemployed workers offering their labour for lower wages. But he didn’t. So he assumed there must be something wrong with the classical laws of economics and, having just witnessed the transition from classical to modern physics, he may have thought something similar was required in the field of economics.\nIn fact, as we now know, the reason why workers were unable to find work at lower wages during the 1930s was because of the Unions’ closed shop. Even after the war the closed shop continued to undermine our economic performance, eventually manifesting itself in the form of stagflation. Milton Friedman first made the analysis of this in his Nobel lecture of June 1977 when he attributed stagflation to what he called “unanticipated increases in aggregate demand”. In plain English this becomes “Union extorted wage increases above the natural level that balances supply and demand for labour”.\nProof of Friedman’s theory came later with Margaret Thatcher’s reform of the Unions, because since then we have not seen the slightest whiff of stagflation. Indeed the term has practically dropped out of the dictionary, and now we are instead experiencing concerns about deflation. Also the phenomenon of zero-hours contracts indicates that workers are now able to price themselves back into work once again, which is supply creating its own demand as the classical laws predicted. Of course we all want proper full-time employment, but this will depend on the economic recovery. In the meantime surely it is better to have half a job rather than no job. At any given time in the economic cycle there is only so much money in circulation available for wages, so sharing it out this way is surely better than making higher unemployment carry the full burden of the shortfall.\nIt was the boom and bust of the late 1980’s which fully demonstrated the effects of demand mismanagement. One of the first things Geoffrey Howe did as Chancellor in 1979 was to remove all remaining exchange and credit controls. This led to people taking out ever greater mortgages to chase up house prices, due to the chronic shortage of housing we have always had in this country. By the mid 1980’s the economy was booming and the yuppy phenomenon was upon us. That would have been the time to take your foot off the accelerator and start moderating demand. Instead Howe’s successor, Nigel Lawson, not only failed to reintroduce credit management but also introduced some of the biggest tax cuts in recorded history (just before an election, of course!). The basic rate of tax came down to 25% from 27% (and 29% the year before) and the top rate to 40% from somewhere up in the stratosphere. Immediately people used the extra money in their pockets to jack up their mortgages still further and the whole thing just blew up in their faces. I am all in favour of tax cuts of course, but timing is crucial!\nIt does however demonstrate the potency of demand-side management. Whilst Jim Callaghan was absolutely right in saying you cannot spend your way out of recession (supply side), that does not mean you cannot cut taxes (or increase benefits) your way out of recession (demand side and increasing the deficit). This is a point the Tories appear to have missed. As I see it stimulating the economy is like trying to move a piece of string lengthways. If you push it, either by fiscal spending or by excessive quantitative easing (QE) the string will just crumple. You have to pull it from the front end. Of course if there is insufficient QE that will pin the trailing end of the string down, so you have to get it just right. The Bank of England (BoE) appear to have been using the FTSE 100 as their indicator since that has been moving sideways for the past fifteen years, but increases in other asset prices, including house prices and the FTSE 250, would suggest they have overdone it.\nWhich brings us to the introduction of monetary policy in the late 80’s and early 90s, and the exit from the ERM. The big advantage of monetary policy is that it acts directly on consumer demand. Also because it is reviewed on a monthly cycle it provides much finer tuning that the annual fiscal cycle. It could be argued that fiscal policy was always too late to have any counter-cyclical effect, though that said Harold Macmillan’s government seemed to manage it pretty well in the late 50’s and early 60’s. Perhaps the housing market wasn’t so critical then.\nWith the benefit of hindsight I would say that John Major was wrong to rely solely on interest rate rises to bring inflation back under control. He needed something much stronger than that, and something which would not undermine the rest of the economy as well. I suspect that the reintroduction of credit controls and mortgage limits would have had a more positive and immediate effect. I do see why he was determined to remain within the ERM, as this stopped any devaluation causing further inflation, but what is interesting is that when we did eventually tumble out of the system in September 1992, no inflation resulted. This demonstrates that, contrary to Ken Clarke’s recent remarks, devaluation can be a very useful tool in the right circumstances. In other words if you have high unemployment and a recession, then that is the time to do it if you need to, because the increase in import prices is simply absorbed. The exit from the ERM set us up for the following ten years of solid economic growth, and it was at this time that I started to form the view that we had it sorted. But I had reckoned without New Labour, Gordon Brown and the development of the global economic cycle! Also without his undermining of the Bank of England’s role as City regulator, thankfully now restored.\nThis piece would not be complete without some reflections on the banking crisis. Four separate factors came together to create the perfect storm that was the banking crisis. Two of these, the subprime housing collapse in the US and the haircutting of Greek sovereign debt (another catastrophic EU decision), both of which caused contagion to spread across the global banking system, were factors beyond the control of any British government. The other two, namely the failure of UK banking regulation and the buildup of national debt, were. Strictly speaking the size of the national debt and deficit did not cause the recession, but it meant that the Coalition had to spend two years reducing the deficit before they could start reducing unemployment.\nThere has, I think, been a lot of very muddled thinking over the banking crisis. It’s not the bail-outs that were the problem. The taxpayer will come out of these with nice fat profits (which would have been even bigger at RBS if Gordon Brown had taken convertible loan stock in the first instance, until he knew the full extent of the losses, rather than equity), and both depositors and creditors were protected as well. Only shareholders, which of course include you and me through our pension funds, lost out. The recession was caused by a combination of contagion and regulation failure (as the banks in retrospect pulled in their horns). Many of the measures taken by the Coalition, such as the bail-in procedures and the ‘electrified’ ring fence, appear to be designed to make it easier for banks to go bust rather than less, which means that any future recession will be even greater! And the decision to increase equity ratios in the middle of a recession is crazy. Surely it would have been better to leave decisions to raise or lower equity ratios to the discretion and timing of the Bank of England?\nOne small and rather technical point we could look at however would be to remove limited-liability status from retail bank subsidiaries. As I am sure you know, under company law the creditors of a bankrupt subsidiary company have no recourse to the holding company for restitution. Normally this encourages investment and economic growth, but in the case of retail banks security is more important. Such a change would place the group at first port of call for any bail out instead of the tax-payer, and create a more arms-length relationship preventing the group from treating its retail subsidiary as a cash cow for its rather more dodgy ‘casino’ activities.\nBut the real problem is the relationship between shareholders and directors. It was the former who lost money whilst the latter were swanning about playing ‘masters of the universe’, and paying themselves the earth to boot. The Coalition is proposing yet more red tape to hold directors more directly responsible, but I suggest that such an interventionist approach may well backfire and undermine the status of the City. Instead I am proposing the introduction of Supervisory Boards for all publicly quoted companies (not just the banks), not to put Unions on them like the Germans do, but to comprise the five or six largest shareholders on the register when the meeting is called, together with perhaps a couple of non-execs and the Chairman and Chief Executive, so that the shareholders have the majority. Company law would give these boards authority over capital reconstructions, takeovers and mergers, and over the appointment and remuneration of the directors. Such an approach would enable the principal shareholders to be involved in these key decisions well before resolutions for general meetings are formulated, whereas the Coalition has merely given shareholders a slightly larger rubber stamp than they had before. Such a structural change would reflect the ownership of the company rather than have the government intervening with yet another raft of red tape.\nFuture Policy\nSo where are we now? What are the challenges facing the first UKIP Chancellor? I suggest these can broadly be considered under following four headings:-\n1). Wage compression and the cost of living,\n2). Employment, the output gap and eliminating the deficit,\n3). Funding our public services to an acceptable standard,\n4). Paying down the National Debt.\nWage compression is simply dealt with by coming out of the European Union combined with imposing consequently a complete moratorium on the immigration of unskilled labour. That’s the only way to do it. Simples – it’s just old-fashioned supply and demand, the price mechanism as it applies to wages. General inflation is the least of our problems at present, and that in turn suggests that an increase in the minimum wage might not only help people struggling with the cost of living but also provide some protection against deflation. I accept that increases in the minimum wage can make reducing unemployment more difficult, but there are other ways we can do that, again not least by limiting immigration. At present a third of all new jobs are going to new immigrants. Ending the green deal will also help.\nIt is over the output gap that the Tories are really going wrong. Last week the TaxPayers’ Alliance published a massive tome designed to cut public expenditure by £77bn, the element of the total deficit of £90bn they claim to be structural. Now I am not against cutting expenditure where it should properly be transferred to the private or charitable sectors, e.g. overseas aid, or where it is identifiable waste. I dare say the TPA have come up with all sorts of excellent ideas on that score. What I am concerned about here is the assumption that most of the deficit is structural, and cannot therefore be reduced by reducing unemployment. The TPA offer no support for that figure.\nHistorically the output gap has been defined as the percentage of unutilised industrial capacity. Once all your productive assets are being fully utilised you cannot increase real GDP any further. That means unemployment cannot be reduced any further, which in turn means tax revenues cannot be increased and welfare payment reduced; what is known as the cyclical element of the deficit. However two points arise. The first is that industrial capacity is not the only resource that is involved, labour including relevant skills are also critical as are energy supplies and other resources. The question is which lie on the critical path. The second point is that few of these resources are inelastic in the longer term. Indeed the more slowly you approach them, the less inelastic they will be. It all depends on what timescales you are looking at, but if we cap immigration as we intend then labour will in due course be the critical factor once full employment is achieved, not industrial capacity.\nAt present British industry is generally profitable and has accumulated substantial savings which it is holding back from investing. That suggests to me that industrial capacity should be viewed at least over the medium term as non-critical. Energy I will leave for another discussion. Labour is the interesting one. It all depends on whether you believe the government’s employment figures. Given the high incidence of part-time working and zero-hours contracts, the level of self-underemployment and the number of people sanctioned off benefits even though they are still fully unemployed, frankly I don’t. It’s all smoke and mirrors designed to win an election. This assumption is backed by reports from HMRC that income tax revenues are below expectations. One of the first things a UKIP Chancellor will have to do is get himself some decent employment statistics.\nSo if at present neither industrial capacity nor employment are critical, the deficit is not structural. For every one percent reduction in unemployment, the deficit reduces by between 20 and £25bn. So a further reduction in unemployment of between 4 and 5% is possible and would wipe out the deficit entirely without either cutting essential expenditure, like the Conservatives, nor increasing taxes, like Labour. But you can only reduce unemployment by this amount by limiting immigration, and you can only do that by leaving the European Union. QED.\nIn the longer term of course UKIP wants deliberately to restrict the availability of unskilled labour, other than on a temporary basis. You therefore eventually come up against a choice between full employment and crude GDP growth. I say crude because of course GDP is a nominal figure which includes both inflation and population growth. We should instead be concerned with real average standards of living, and these have plummeted over the past ten years. Two years ago I downloaded some statistics from the ONS website and constructed an index for real average standards of living which I set at 100 for the year 2000. It rose to 105.3 in 2005, dipped to 105.2 in 2006, up to 105.6 in 2007 and then plummeted to 83.4 in 2012. Obviously the fall after 2007 is principally caused by the recession, but it is the very slow growth before that and the dip in 2006 which are interesting. If one allows 1% pa for normal productivity growth, modest when you consider the phase of the cycle, there is no reflection of the growth in personal credit and the fact that we were living ‘beyond our means’ by 2007. Both strongly indicate an adverse effect from immigration. Also the sheer size of the fall afterwards surely cannot be attributed solely to the recession? This is logical when you consider that standard of living is real GDP divided by population. So if population rises faster than real GDP our standard of living falls. It’s just mathematics. That is the evidence.\nMany people overlook the fact that anyone living here is consuming as much as they are producing. You have to be a higher rate taxpayer or net saver to be contributing more than you take out, and at the other end of the scale those on benefits, living on increasing credit or sending money overseas are taking out more than they are putting in. Everyone else in the middle is neutral, except that any increase in population spreads our available resources more thinly leaving less for each. This is as true for an increase in the birth rate as it is for immigration, but that is another story.\nThere are other impediments to reducing unemployment of course, and our strategy must include them. Principally these are:\n1). A regional policy designed to achieve an even level of percentage employment across the land (see my previous post),\n2). Effective welfare reforms designed to provide a better balance of carrots and sticks to entice the unemployed back into work. I advocate a big increase in the earnings disregards to really ‘make work pay’, and\n3). Better education for the least able or most distracted children. We must introduce procedures to identify these children much earlier, perhaps by introducing GCPEs, so that we can then tailor their education directly to their needs.\nAs listed elsewhere UKIP’s policies are likely to make over £40bn of extra money available both for funding public services and for cutting taxes. It is money the other parties simply won’t have. Leaving the European Union is central to achieving it.\nFinally there is the question of how we deal with the National Debt itself. As I set out in my election address, the answer is obviously to set up a Sovereign Wealth Fund to hedge it. With interest rates on the floor we have had a golden opportunity to do this, yet Osborne has completely flunked it.

  "https_jepoynton_com_/https_jepoynton_com_2015_12_19_reflections-on-question-time-17th-december-2015/content_73.html": "Now that the debate over leaving the European Union is well under way it is becoming more interesting to respond to the arguments being put forward by the Stay-In Brigade rather than go over yet again the well-worn reasons for leaving.\nLast Thursday’s episode of Question Time gave a perfect opportunity to do this. It came from Slough and the panel comprised Piers Morgan, Hannah Bardell from the SNP, Jacob Rees-Mogg (Con), Emily Thornberry (Lab), and Mark Reckless. It was also encouraging to see how sympathetic the QT audience now are to the Leave point of view, and even David Dimbleby showed a much more open-minded position than perhaps has always been the case in the past.\nThe first point that arose was from Hannah Bardell who claimed that Brexit would mean that Scotland would lose all the funding she currently receives from the EU. This of course is complete rubbish as Westminster would be in a position to replace that funding £ for £, if not better, due to the saving of £11 billion or so that Brexit would generate. I have heard the same argument from a number of institutions, including Universities who ought to know better. To emphasis the point the Leave/UKIP campaign should perhaps guarantee that for the first two years after Brexit all funding currently received by UK institutions from the EU will be replaced £ for £. After that ongoing review could alter matters in either direction.\nThe next point came from Emily Thornberry who picked up on Sir John Major’s recent comments about Britain opting for ‘splendid isolation’ in international affairs which he thought would leave us powerless to promote or protect our essential interests. But have they not noticed how powerless we already are? What could be more debilitating than belonging to an organisation, the EU, that insists on sole representation of our interests internationally but then pays absolutely no attention to our point of view? The fact is we are already in splendid isolation, and Brexit will re-establish our ability to reach out and engage in the world around us. We will be able to do so through all sorts of alternative relationships as and when the need arises. Britain is one of the most talented nations on earth and will thrive once let free.\nAnother point that Labour and LibDem politicians often raise, though not on this occasion, is a fear than they may lose employment protection and other laws which have originated from the EU and are now on our statute book. Again this is scaremongering, because the day after Brexit those laws will still be there. By regaining our sovereignty we can chose, one by one, whether we wish to keep them or ditch them. It’s a red herring.\nAnd then came the whole issue of trade. I have argued elsewhere why I think the Single Market is destabilising and counter-productive, and how leaving the EU without a new trade treaty could be just what the doctor ordered. The question came in the light of recent research by Lord Rose, who we are told is leading the Stay campaign, that Brexit would cost around £11bn in increased trade tariffs raised by the EU on our exports to them if we had to revert to trading under WTO rules.\nNow I have no argument with that figure, as I have not been able to check it, so let’s accept it for the purpose of the argument. The point he has completely overlooked is that the same will apply to their exports to us. And because we import far more from the continent than we export to it, the result would be a net benefit! I accept that both imports and exports would be lower, and that there would be a period of adjustment during the transition as companies orientated towards exports would struggle and those aimed at the domestic market would expand, but it is ultimately the balance between them that matters.\nI do normally advocate free trade, but such a position does assume we pursue policies which keep our trade in balance. We have not done that, and have ended up now with a deficit in excess of £5bn. A trade deficit exports jobs and undermines employment, so anything that reduces a trade deficit is a good thing, even if that means lower volumes. Employment within the UK can then be adjusted by stimulating or moderating consumer demand through fiscal and monetary policies, and of course the ability to control our borders will mean the focus transfers to a shortage of labour rather than remaining on a shortage of jobs.\nThis means that if the EU were to throw a tantrum after Brexit, always possible, and refuse to negotiate a new trade deal, despite that being in their own best interests, we can always just walk away at no loss to the UK. Whichever way it goes, we can handle it. So please, do not lose any sleep over trade.\nFinally, and this is another point that did not in fact arise on this occasion, there is the whole question of why big business and leading UK institutions such as our universities are so uniformly in favour of staying in. The answer is that they can afford to spend a lot of time and money lobbying politicians both in Brussels and at Westminster. This gives them an advantage over smaller businesses that cannot afford to do this. So the question is, does the nation as a whole benefit from it? Almost certainly not, as most of our employment creation and economic growth comes from all of those small and medium-sized businesses put together. Restricting access to politicians would reduce corruption and create a more level playing field to the benefit of the nation as a whole. So let’s take the EU out of the equation once and for all.\nJust to make sure people are aware that the European Union (political) and the EEA (single market/non-political) are different and separate bodies. We want to leave the politics and govern ourselves. The main problems with trade are the non-tariff barriers – see ‘Flexcit’ http://www.eureferendum.com/documents/flexcit.pdf\nIt is a detailed plan and there is a shorter version available.\nLikeLike\nThanks for the reference. Yes, non-tariff barriers are the way in which the EU has been blocking our exports.\nLikeLike",
  "https_jepoynton_com_/https_jepoynton_com_author_jepoynton/content_13.html": "Mr. Speaker, it is an honour and a privilege for me to have this opportunity to present to the House the government’s budget for the coming year.\nAs the House will already know, our economy and government finances are in a desperate and sorry state. Over the past nearly 25 years we have suffered a series of setbacks that have enveloped us in a perfect storm, starting with our membership of the European Union Single Market which has seen our trade balance with those countries plummet from having been broadly in balance to a deficit at the time of the Brexit Referendum of £109 billion; that’s 6% of GDP at that time. This has presented British business with a contracting market. Generally speaking business will not invest into a contracting market, with the result that productivity growth has suffered.\nThen we had the banking crisis, triggered by an oil price spike in 2007 which led to the default of many sub-prime mortgages in the USA and which our banks had invested into. But there were also collapses on this side of the pond such as Northern Rock and HBOS which were simply due to over-trading, and that can only be due to a failure of regulation here. One bright spot then arises as the banks were quickly recapitalised through the use of quantitative easing, which did not on that occasion produce inflation as it was merely replacing credit which had been destroyed in the crisis. Unfortunately later on the QE was restarted with inevitable inflationary consequences.\nOn top of all that we had austerity and the failure to start a Sovereign Wealth Fund when interest rates hit the floor. Mr. Speaker, I am sure that most members are aware that 5% compounded will quadruple your money within 30 years, and 7% double it within ten. Over the past thirty years returns on many foreign shares have been far greater than the cost of government borrowing here. That is because the rate of growth in many other countries has been far faster than it has been here and is likely to continue that way for some time to come. It must make sense for us to benefit from their success in this way. A golden opportunity completely missed.\nThen we come to Brexit which some today are blaming for all our financial woes. Mr. Speaker, I do not accept that analysis but instead that the Trade and Co-operation Agreement has locked us into the catastrophic trade deficit we inherited from the Single Market. It is not enough to secure no tariffs in either direction when there are a host of other regulations creating the imbalance, and we need the use of tariffs to counter that effect. That will almost certainly mean scrapping the TCA, and whilst trade volumes may fall, the much greater effect of import substitution will present British business at home with the expanding market they crave to invest and create productivity growth and jobs.\nFollowing that we had Covid and the energy crisis caused by the war in Ukraine, thankfully temporarily as Russia has found other outlets into the international oil markets, and all of the panic over climate change. And if that weren’t enough mass immigration, quite apart from increasing cultural conflict within the country, has condemned wages to minimum levels, undermined working conditions and caused record levels of unemployment and homelessness. And to cap it all, we have an ageing population pushing the cost of pensions and health care through the roof. Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear!\nNow, Mr. Speaker, it is not my intention to spend time trying to apportion blame for this situation. Many of these circumstances were beyond our control, and for others it is easy to be wise after the event. My purpose is to identify the causes so we can take appropriate action to remedy them and to quantify the task itself. Our National Debt is now close to 100% of GDP after having been nearly paid off a quarter of a century ago, and the cost of interest on that debt is now over £100 billion a year, nearly 4% GDP in itself, and rising. The total fiscal deficit is around £170 billion and that is adding to the Debt all the time. It is imperative, Mr. Speaker, that we get our nose ahead of the game so that we can reverse the whole process.\nMy strategy is based on three key objectives necessary to provide a tripod of stability for our recovery. First I aim to achieve a fiscal surplus of 1% GDP within five years. Second I want a trade surplus of 1% GDP by that time, and third we must achieve net zero immigration as well. Add to that some essential tax cuts to motivate growth and expenditure increases to avoid imminent collapse of some public services and we are looking at an annual fiscal turnaround of £300 billion by the end of our first five years.\nOn average I must save £60 billion in each of the next five years, but that is only on average. There are couple of policies which can raise substantial funds in excess of this amount up front, while others such as revived economic growth will be weighted towards the end. The good news is that over the following five years those trends should lead to a much greater turnaround of around £450 billion or more, with much greater scope for both tax cuts and expenditure increases, which I shall aim broadly to keep equal. I shall also aim to cut the total level of taxation down to 30% GDP, whereas currently it is around 37%, all the while maintaining fiscal and trade surpluses of 1% GDP. History shows that all the economies with the highest rates of economic growth have run Balance of Payments surpluses and I am determined the UK should be in that group.\nSo, Mr. Speaker, let me make a start.\nMy first port of call is multinational corporations, which have long had a habit of shifting their profits into tax havens, or semi tax havens such as the Republic of Ireland, to avoid corporation tax in this country. Now I accept that at 25% our rate of corporation tax is too high, and I shall return to that later, but for now may I completely reject the argument that this country must somehow engage in a race to bottom just to remain competitive. There are other ways we can regulate our trade balance, and in any case if were able to collect what is morally due to us, profits made out purchases by the good citizens of this country, that would provide the funds to reduce it.\nOver ten years ago now, the G8 at its summit in Enniskillen tasked the OECD with ending this practice. They have completely failed to do so and show no signs of any significant progress as they just kick the can further on down the road. Clearly the multinationals have got to them! We cannot afford to wait any longer.\nThe good news is that this is very easy to rectify. Henceforth multinationals, which we shall define as any company that has more than 10% of its turnover in more than one country, shall be taxed on the basis of their global profits, as declared to their shareholders and in the public domain, and apportioned to this country by turnover, including non-domestic intercompany sales. They may be able to shift their head offices and their intellectual property rights, but they cannot shift their customers! It is difficult to forecast accurately without an established database exactly how much additional revenue this will raise, but our best estimates suggest it could be within the range of £40 to 50 billion if not more.\nSecond, Mr. Speaker, I am abolishing Inheritance Tax. It is a very inefficient tax, raising only about a third of 1% GDP; is double taxation in the hands of the deceased; uses up a disproportionate amount of tax legislation and consequently distracts the attention of thousands of lawyers and accountants who should be more constructively engaged.\nHowever I recognise that a society in which around 2% of the population own 80% of its assets is not a healthy one. I want to reduce this wealth gap but not eliminate it. It remains important that those with energy, ability and enterprise can profit from them for the benefit of us all. In practice however much of this accumulated wealth is passive asset appreciation.\nI therefore aim to raise about 2% GDP by charging legacies to capital gains tax in the hands of beneficiaries. This would require a 50% withholding tax to counter avoidance, but which would be repaid, with interest, when the gains are presented for assessment. I do not propose to introduce a wealth tax, which would also be double taxation in the hands of the taxpayer as well as very difficult to collect as much of it would disappear into overseas trusts and corporate structures.\nCapital gains will be assessed to income tax at the taxpayer’s marginal rate with no additional allowances. However I am allowing it to be spread over ten years so that poorer beneficiaries can use up more of their allowances and lower rate bands. This reflects the rule-of-thumb PE ratio of 10 often used to value small companies.\nExisting roll-over reliefs from inheritance tax such as for farms and businesses will be maintained and I am adding relief for the repayment of any student loans, not necessarily those of the taxpayer. Tax on occupied primary residences, again not necessarily by the taxpayer or his family, such as a sitting tenant, may be deferred until that occupant leaves.\nI am also abolishing Non-Dom status, but replacing it with a flat cap on income tax, including capital gains, of £250,000 in any one year.\nThese two changes alone should raise around £80 billion a year. I am not seeking to raise any other taxes. I am however reintroducing marginal relief from corporation tax for small businesses with a zero rate allowance of one million and a lower rate band of two million. The lower rate will be half the full rate which remains at 25%. In the longer term I aim to reduce taxation to 30% GDP and increase the personal tax allowance to match the typical minimum wage at £20,000, and reduce the top rate to 40%. I may also introduce an intermediate rate at 30%.\nMr. Speaker I now come to a series of changes focused on reducing the burden on the taxpayer without endangering essential public services by focusing on efficiency and alternative sources of finance.\nBetter late than never I am introducing a Sovereign Wealth Fund which will be funded by borrowing at an interest rate not greater than 5% and at an amount, if available in the gilts markets, of 1% GDP a year. The asset will offset the liability and therefore have no effect on net debt. This will be farmed out to multiple professional fund managers with after time the more successful attracting greater contributions.\nIn addition I am starting the funding of a new state pension. This necessarily must be a gradual and prolonged process which will not have any significant effect on the public finances for many years. It will be available only to those under the age of 25 on 6th April next year and will be optional. Modelling suggests it will primarily benefit those on above average salaries, thereby halving in due course the number in the existing state pension. This in turn may allow us to improve the existing state pension significantly. For those who opt in, the existing employee national insurance contribution of 8% becomes a national pension contribution and is placed in an account in their name to which a guaranteed 4% interest as added annually. Of the three parameters of contribution rate, retirement age and pension amount, they will have the flexibility to fix any two and get a quote for the third. They may opt in or change these parameters at a later date, subject to not reducing the pension to an annuity equivalent below the level that would trigger entitlement to pension credits, and their remaining entitlement to the existing state pension will be determined by the number of years’ contributions in the existing way. This will create a fully flexible and transferable pension scheme which is currently unavailable to many, including those who switch employment between the public and private sectors. The money will physically go into the Sovereign Wealth Fund, which should get a better return for carrying risk, and will be part of its 1% GDP per annum funding target.\nMr. Speaker I am also introducing a National Credit Card. The purpose of the card is to give all citizens access to the private sector for essential services such as health and education on a means-tested basis. Just taking the health and schools budgets alone costs the taxpayer around £250 billion a year. If 50% used the private sector instead, and the average means-tested support for fees was also 50%, then the saving to the taxpayer would be over £60 billion a year.\nWe shall have to introduce this gradually to enable the supply side to meet increasing demand and it will be optional. Users pay for services in the normal way but do not have to settle the card at the end of the month. Instead after the end of the year when the taxman assesses your tax he will also review how much you have spent on your card, put the two together and recharge your share of the cost to your tax bill for the following year. Working capital will come from the Sovereign Wealth Fund at 5% which will be added to your costs from the date of purchase, but users will be able to pay on account to avoid it. The means test rate will be a simple percentage set at the beginning of each fiscal year for each user set in due course to encourage 50% usage. Much of these savings will then be available to improve the state services, and the fact that the private sector is accessible to all will remove any stain of privilege that some attribute to it at present.\nMr. Speaker, with the help of my RH colleagues I am taking a number of measures to improve efficiency within our public services. First we shall be splitting the civil service clean in two so that the advisory side, which advises ministers on current problems and future legislation, becomes completely separate and independent from the executive side, which delivers services mandated by Parliament. Two completely separate functions requiring separate organisational structures. This way the advisory side can assist ministers in holding the executive side to account.\nSecond we shall be appointing a national chief executive with the power to hire and fire local chief executives for every national public service. It is an extraordinary fact that currently few if any of our public services actually have any top management at all. No wonder they are all running around like headless chickens being hopelessly inefficient.\nThese chief executives will be mandated to ensure that sufficient trained British staff are recruited into each service, that they are paid the rate for the job so that staff turnover rates are minimised, and that agency and support staff are reduced to less than 25% of payroll each. I am also allowing staff bonuses to be paid out of 10% of any local budget savings or collected charges.\nThird, I am abolishing national wage bargaining in the tax funded public sector. Henceforth all such staff will be paid a full inflationary increase on 1st April each year. I reject the argument that this will create an inflationary wage spiral on the grounds both that there are no prices in this sector and that inflation increases the tax base anyway. But it is also important for staffing stability that all staff are paid the rate for the job, which will vary by skill and location across the country with additional increases awarded locally and which therefore cannot be addressed on a national basis.\nThese measures taken together could save another £30 billion a year as well as ensure they are no longer dependent on immigration for staff.\nSpeaking of immigration, my RH friend the Home Secretary will be scrapping the current points-based system and replacing it with an auctioned reducing quota system so that total immigration is reduced to below emigration rates within five years. It is therefore vital that we are able to reduce unemployment at the same or faster rate. Indeed we currently have over 3% job vacancies across our economy which is roughly double historical norms and only serves to suck in yet more immigrants. I shall therefore be instructing the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee henceforth to use a composite 4% target when setting interest rates; that is 2% inflation plus 2% job vacancies. I anticipate this will mean interest rates will remain at around the 5% mark for the foreseeable future, which is necessary anyway to encourage savings and fund investment, and will also probably be needed to contain the inflationary impact of wage rises in a tighter labour market. I shall be addressing the housing market separately in a few moments.\nIn addition I have a new regional policy designed to reduce the regional pay and unemployment gaps. It must make sense to focus stimulation to where unemployment is highest post code by post code across the country leading eventually to an even level of percentage employment across the land. This will increase income tax revenues and reduce welfare claims so it is likely to be fiscally neutral in the longer term.\nTo do so I shall cease funding new free tax and enterprise zones, which have a very chequered and uneven history, and instead introduce discounts for income tax, business rates and employers national insurance where the discount is proportionate to the local level of unemployment. For the coming year this discount will be 5% for every 1% that unemployment, measured on the claimant basis, is above 5%. We will review this algorithm annually to ensure a steady reduction in the regional gap.\nI also have a number of measures to free up the labour market to reduce structural unemployment. First I am repealing all IR35 legislation, which was designed to prevent employers avoiding the cost of national insurance contributions on permanent staff, by the simple measure of charging the invoices of self-employed and agency staff to NICs also. Professional fees will be exempt. The increased revenues will be used to reduce employers NICs for all so that the measure is fiscally neutral.\nIn any case I am immediately reducing employers NICs to 12% and increasing the minimum wage and universal credits in line with the triple lock on the state pension. I am also introducing marginal relief for employers NI with a zero alowance of £1000 per week of payroll, and a lower band of £2000 at a rate of half the full rate.\nSecond my RH friend the Work and Pensions Secretary will be undertaking a full post-implementation review of the introduction of Universal Credits with a view to making it simpler and more streamlined and efficient. In particular he will ensure that the thresholds for and rates of clawback are also universal, and that once vetted claimants do not have to reapply every time they get a gap between jobs. This is particularly important for self-employed people who currently often decline short term or low paid assignments because of the hassle and delays in reapplying.\nWithin this context I am increasing the threshold, or earnings disregard, for clawback of universal credits to £50 per week. This will create a much greater incentive for unemployed people to make that first leap back into employment, and will also allow low paid workers in the taper to keep more of what they themselves have earned. This will both reduce the poverty trap and the pressure on food banks many of which are struggling to obtain sufficient supplies.\nMr. Speaker, I now turn to support for farmers and care homes. At first sight they do not have much in common but they are both essential to our wellbeing, are competitive within the private sector and yet need financial support if they are to produce both food and care at affordable levels and remain profitable. Furthermore farmers are in competition with foreign imports which are heavily subsidised.\nFor both industries I am introducing a public subsidy at 10% on turnover. This will be subject to a profit cap at 5% before tax to prevent profiteering by larger businesses at the expense of both taxpayer and customer. The subsidy is designed to promote sales, and the profit cap will encourage competitive pricing and support greater expenditure. Qualifying directors remuneration will be restricted. In future years the rate of subsidy will be adjusted so that no more than 5% of businesses liquidate each year.\nMany businesses in a variety of industries receive public subsidies and there has been much concern at their profits. I am therefore extending the profit cap to all entities in receipt of public subsidy, though the cap may vary according to their capital investment requirements. I am also extending it proportionately to all companies with contracts with the public sector worth annually over 10% of their turnover.\nFinally Mr. Speaker I come to the housing market. I shall be reducing house prices from now on by between 1 and 2% a year on average. This is easily done by giving the Bank of England that target and by tightening criteria such as mortgage to value and income to mortgage used by commercial lenders.\nNow you may at first sight think that would make it more difficult for prospective purchasers to find and buy a new house, but in fact that is not so. For one thing the number of available houses out there does not change, and for another the supply is likely to increase because sellers will hurry to sell before prices reduce further. More importantly developers will no longer be able to make capital gains on their land banks and so can only build houses on them and sell them. In monetary terms the reduction in demand will be matched by a reduction is prices until all available houses are sold.\nThe misconstrued Help to Buy policy has just made matters worse, so I am in effect reversing it. Last year fewer new houses were built than before the policy was introduced over ten years ago and it has just pushed house prices even higher. Irrespective of whether we can balance supply and demand, the amount of credit tied up in the housing market means that house prices are likely to remain high. Yet house prices must come down if younger people are to buy when they get married and start a family and others to escape the parental nest and develop as independent adults.\nCurrently it takes on average over five years to build out a granted planning consent whereas no so long ago it was only two. It has been reported that there are hundreds of thousands of such consents gathering dust in the pending trays of property developers because they can make more money from capital gains. But it is important to understand also that they have themselves been squeezed by increasing land prices. As a result they have endeavoured to recoup their margins by resorting to dodgy practices such as denying buyers adequate snagging periods and tying them up into leaseholds with uncontrollable ground rent increases, and generally cutting costs and building to very low standards. Many such properties are now unsaleable. Mr. Speaker I am giving Help to Buy purchasers a new six month snagging period, with a survey at taxpayer’s expense to ensure objectivity, and with all restitution costs at the sellers expense.\nMy RH friend the Secretary of State for Housing, will be carrying out a full review of planning and related procedures including the possible repeal of the 1961 Land Compensation Act which gives 100% of all planning gain to landowners. We believe it may be more appropriate to divide planning gain equally between landowners, a national development corporation with powers of compulsory purchase to focus new development in the North where there are plentiful brownfield sites available, supported by regional policy which will encourage both people and jobs to move there, and local development corporations who can use the money for local infrastructure thereby creating balanced communities. The South East is overcrowded and current development priorities just make that worse. They are levelling down not levelling up. We will protect and maintain the green belt.\nOn social housing I am restoring the full housing benefit which will become affordable again as immigration falls. This will allow housing associations access to the City for development finance, and I shall be adding a government guarantee to help reduce borrowing costs. We will continue to support Right to Buy as it does not reduce total housing available but I am halving the discounts.\nFollowing the Grenfell Tower Tragedy many leaseholders have become trapped with spiralling service charges which they cannot pay. I am therefore limiting service charge increases to inflation backdated to the date of the tragedy, and will refund landlords forced into loss by this, subject to reasonable limits on insurance premiums and other costs.\nIn summary Mr. Speaker I anticipate that for the coming year tax increases and expenditure savings with bring in around £80 billion and tax reductions and expenditure increases cost around £20 billion, giving my target net saving of £60 billion. I am also placing a five and ten year Source and Application of Funds Statement in the library and online. So now it just remains for me to I thank the House for their patience and attention during this speech. It is a budget for working people and small businesses combined with a strategy to save Britain, and I commend it to the House."
