Our return to bus travel from recognised at last year’s UK Bus Awards as the city took gold in the Partnership for Excellence category.\nEncouraging more people to choose the bus not only reduces congestion but also contributes to better air quality and creating a healthier environment for all of us. Portsmouth’s Bus Service Improvement Plan (BSIP) is one of a range of initiatives your Lib Dem-run council has championed including fare free days, 24-hour bus routes, and more frequent buses.\nMaking bus travel accessible for everyone is a key part of our efforts to improve transport in our city. At a time when the Labour government are taxing jobs and slashing support to the most vulnerable, I’m proud that your Lib Dem council is continuing to invest in Portsmouth working towards our shared vision of a city that works for everyone. It’s part of our plan to keep Portsmouth moving forward.\nCllr Peter Candlish, Cabinet Member for Transport\nIf you’ve got any ideas on how bus stops can be improved in your community, the council’s BSIP is welcoming feedback until 5pm on Friday 11 April. You can get involved by emailing citytravel@portsmouthcc.gov.uk or by writing to BSIP Team, Floor 2, Portsmouth City Council, Civic Offices, Guildhall Square, Portsmouth, PO1 2AL.\nMore information about the proposed improvements can be found on the council website at http://travel.portsmouth.gov.uk/bsip-schemes/bus-stop-improvements/.",

I am standing because I am fed up with our city and country being taken for granted. With each of the crises we’ve seen over the past decade, local residents have been hit hard.\nI’m fed up of the mess that the Conservatives have created across the city and the whole country. The NHS is broken, and QA hospital is regularly overwhelmed - we need more nurses, doctors and dentists in the city. The botched Conservative Brexit deal is damaging our port and our relationship with Europe needs repairing. Rishi's recession and the ongoing cost-of-living is pushing hard-working people into poverty across the city. Raw sewage is regularly being pumped into the sea and local harbours thanks to the Conservative government's failure to act. And instead of acting, the Conservative government just fight amongst themselves.\nIt's time for a change, and it's time to throw the Conservatives out.\nAs an island city, we are uniquely exposed to the effects of climate change. Our country needs a clear plan to fight climate change, but the Conservatives are approving new oil and gas drilling, and Labour have already broken their promise on green investment.”\nFocusing in particular on the effects of climate change, Simon commented on the failure of both Labour and the Conservatives to properly focus on the environment and climate change:\n“We live in England's only island city, meaning we're on the front-line when facing the effects of climate change. However, the Conservatives are approving new oil and gas drilling, which will only speed up climate change, and will not address energy security concerns.\nAnd now, the Labour party have u-turned on their promise to properly invest in green energy and technology. This will mean we will fall even further behind the EU and US\nHowever, locally, our Liberal Democrat-run council are prioritising policies to address climate change - from introducing plug-in shore power for ships visiting the council-owned port, to investing in solar panels for council buildings.”\nCelebrating the Liberal Democrats’ record of delivery on Portsmouth City Council, Simon said:\n“Across our city, local residents have continued to elect hard-working Liberal Democrats to represent them. Despite the Conservative Government bankrupting councils across the country, Portsmouth Liberal Democrats have protected the city’s finances with responsible management, and continue to invest in our great city.\nThanks to the Liberal Democrats, Portsmouth now enjoys hugely improved bus services, new sports facilities, investment in our council-owned port, new household food waste recycling, and delivering new sea defences all around the city to protect from rising sea levels.\nIt's time to throw the Conservative government out, and only the Liberal Democrats can be trusted to deliver for Portsmouth residents. With our record of delivering locally, just think what we could achieve nationally.”",

If you've taken the bus recently, you may also have seen the newly completed bus gate near the Cascades.\nWe're also going to bid for new funding to unlock the nearby City Centre North plans that would revitalise the heart of the city.\nIn December, planning permission was approved for a new leisure centre and GP surgery at Bransbury Park which will be a state of the art new facility.\nIn the north of the city, Hilsea Lido opened after a major refurbishment in time for its 90th anniversary as a much-loved leisure facility for local residents.\nThese plans will be part of a greener future for Portsmouth, sitting comfortably alongside a major push to double tree canopy coverage across the city.\nBut this year hasn't been easy. For many people, life got harder in 2024. Winter fuel payments were withdrawn by the government and the cost of living is a real challenge.\nThe City Council has rolled out one-off fuel support to help people through this winter given the very short notice given by government for some of these changes. We are also continuing some ongoing cost of living support for city residents.\nFor the longer term, we are also increasing the city's stock of council housing so that everyone has an affordable place to call home. That is real action to solve Portsmouth's housing crisis.\nLooking ahead, 2025 will be the Year of Literature with Portsmouth Creates, which will be celebrating our city's rich literature heritage, future, and the challenges we face. This will be part of the city's bustling cultural scene next year.\nWe also have a summer packed full of events, including the prestigious international Sail Grand Prix (Sail GP) which will take place off Southsea beach in July.\nWhat a year 2024 has been!

On Sunday 6 April Stagecoach introduced a new number 19 service from the City Centre to Anchorage Park via Burfield Road and Ocean Retail Park, along with a more frequent and extended number 18 service running ever 20 minutes now running all the way to Clarence Pier - making trips to the seafront and connections to the Isle of Wight so much easier.\nThose are just two of the changes that have been possible because of the strong working relationship between your Lib Dem council and our local bus companies. This partnership has allowed us to unlock funding from the city’s Bus Service Improvement Plan to make services work better for you, including an expanded timetable for the number 20 service connecting the city and Leigh Park which will now run more frequently, later into the evening, and on Sundays for the first time.\nThese improvements are part of the public transport revolution we promised two years ago. We’re dedicated to building a city that works for everyone which includes a stronger public transport network, an environmentally responsible approach to developing our city, and an increase in opportunities to engage with sport and leisure - including the Great Britain Sail Grand Prix which Portsmouth is hosting in July, and which will be brilliantly served by the new extended number 18 route.\nCllr Peter Candlish, Cabinet Member for Transport\nDespite Labour’s bus tax increasing fares from £2 to £3, Portsmouth is continuing to lead in using public transport with over 12 million bus journeys in our city last year.\nEveryone benefits from a stronger bus network: bus riders get where they want to go faster and simpler, car drivers face less congestion and less competition for parking spaces, and pedestrians and cyclists get cleaner air to breath (especially as we continue to adopt electric busses).\nCllr Peter Candlish and the Portsmouth Lib Dem team are passionate about our city and proud to work for it every day - let’s keep Portsmouth moving forward.",

And 3,494 investigations were closed without even identifying a suspect - meaning 78% of burglaries went unsolved.\nThe Liberal Democrats have also uncovered shocking figures on police attendance of burglaries. Nationally, almost four in ten burglaries in the country did not result in a visit to the scene by a police officer. The figures were based on data provided by 19 police forces in England. Hampshire police force did not provide the data.\nThe Liberal Democrats are calling for a new “Burglary Response Guarantee,” which would create a guarantee that all domestic burglaries are attended by the police and properly investigated.\nThis will require a return to proper community policing - where officers are visible, trusted, and have the time and resources needed to focus on solving crime.\nSince 2015, the Conservatives have taken over 4,000 Police Community Support Officers off the streets, while they look set to have broken their key promise of having recruited an extra 20,000 police officers by the end of March 2023.\nCommenting, Liberal Democrat Cabinet Member for Saftey in the Community, Jason Fazackarley said:\n“It is shocking that so many burglaries in our community are going unsolved by the police. No family should be denied justice after suffering the distress and trauma of being burgled.\n“Many families now feel unsafe in their own homes, because this Conservative government has left our police forces overstretched and under-resourced. It means far too many victims are being denied justice and far too many criminals are getting away with it.\n“The Liberal Democrats would ensure that if people are burgled, they know the police will attend the scene and investigate properly. More and more people across Portsmouth are turning to the Liberal Democrats, because they know we work hard for our communities, we hear your concerns, and we never take you for granted.”",

We know that many of you are looking forward to this new facility, made possible by your Lib Dem-run council, which will include two modern swimming pools.\nNot only will this new facility provide a range of activities in Bransbury Park, but it will also allow us to move forward with our plan to create an Eastney Beach Sea Water Sports Centre, which we've been working towards for over a decade. We know that a lot of people have strong views about the future of our community, which is why we want you to get involved and let us know what's impotant to you. Portsmouth City Council's leisure team have launched a consultation, open from today until 9 May, to get residents' views on this fabulous redevelopment opportunity.\nBuilding on Portsmouth's successful hosting of the 2023 Formula Kite Championship in Eastney, our vision will create a nation-leading hub for sports like kiteboarding, kitesurfing, rowing, kayaking, stand-up paddleboarding, and sea swimming. The development also gives us the chance to add facilities that you want onto our seafront; from showering and changing facilities to a café, retail space and creative studios.\nI think a new sea sports centre in the heart of our community would be a marvellous addition to our seafront. The 'Windbreak' outdoor art gallery, the new Speaker's Corner plaza, and the 'Theatre of the Sea' behind Southsea Castle are fantastic examples of what an ambitious council - like our Lib Dem-led council here in Portsmouth - can achieve. A new watersports centre would lift the whole area and attract more world class events to Eastney like the Formula Kite European Championships in 2023 and 2025 Sailing GP.\nCllr Peter Candlish, Councillor for Eastney and Craneswater\nPortsmouth Lib Dems and Portsmouth City Council see the upcoming demolition of the old Eastney swimming pool as a chance to create better, more sustainable, and more accessible leaisure facilities for our city. The current building, which is 120 years old and has been closed permanently since 2020, is in a very poor condition with extensive structual issues with the walls and roof. The council's inspectors have shown that the condition of the old building is a danger to both staff and the public. The cost to make the existing building safe to use for another purpose would be extremely expensive.

It is our clear position that Portsmouth should not be forced to participate in Local Government Reorganisation\nPortsmouth should not be forced to reorganise because we are not a failing local authority. The Council was established 28 years ago and, since our creation, we have been a resounding success, acting as a tireless advocate for our communities and the city's unique identity. Portsmouth City Council is an excellent, financially stable local authority, which is highly regarded among our 210,000 residents, and a Council that is progressive and ambitious for the city’s future.\nAs a successful existing unitary, we have already integrated and embedded our services, maximising efficiencies through opportunities such as: enhanced planning and transport performance, closer alignment of adult social care and housing, closer collaboration between environmental health and trading standards, a more enhanced offer to care leavers, and our functions as a waste collection and disposal authority.\nPortsmouth City Council is a financially stable local authority. A forced merger with other Councils, particularly taking on Hampshire County Council's financial stresses, will be detrimental to the great services we provide our communities and businesses. Local Government Reorganisation will also paralyse our ambitious new transformation programme and will immediately expose our residents to financial risk and uncertainty.\nLike every Council, we have a great sense of pride in the services we provide for our residents and businesses, and we are determined to ensure that local government reorganisation does not destabilise this.\nWe are particularly concerned that the sound financial investments we have made to develop our International Port and our commercial property portfolio investments, both of which bring in significant income to support local services, will now be shared by neighbouring areas which were not party to these strategic decisions. These investments and purchases, which were made by and on behalf of the people of Portsmouth and currently benefit our city and protect essential services, will inevitably be diluted over a much larger area, threatening the loss of services here.\nWe are aware that the Government's aim is to create new unitary authorities by abolishing two-tier local government and to create new authorities that are financially viable, which can deliver growth, and which reflect community identity. In terms of financial viability, it is worth noting that Hampshire County Council has a budget deficit of at least £136m for 2026-27. Unless the Government deals with this deficit, and the underlying financial pressure on demand-led services causing this deficit, we believe that any new unitary authority will be in effective bankruptcy territory on day one. It cannot be right therefore that Portsmouth is forced into a situation that will reduce the financial viability of services delivered to its residents, communities and our workforce.\nThe Unions have expressed significant concern about employment uncertainty and the prospect of job losses that would be driven by the need to make cuts to local services to address the anticipated severe financial distress that any new Council which includes Portsmouth will face from the start. We share these concerns. The Unions have specifically asked that these concerns are conveyed directly to you and your department.\nNoting the Government’s desire to create new authorities that reflect community identity, we do not believe the expanded geography will reflect the strong community identity or pride in the city that currently exists in Portsmouth.\nIn terms of growth, we believe that our active and enthusiastic participation in the Hampshire & The Solent devolution proposal will help achieve growth across the area, without the need to force Portsmouth to participate in reorganisation.\nThe Government's aims will simply not be met by forcing Portsmouth to be included in Local Government Reorganisation. For this reason, we strongly request that in terms of reorganisation you leave Portsmouth alone and let us continue as a successful and viable unitary authority, highly regarded by its residents and businesses and with positive ratings for both adults' and children's services.\nWhile we do not agree with the inclusion of Portsmouth City Council in Local Government Reorganisation and we have set out a strong argument to be left out of the current reorganisation proposals, we fear the Government is committed to forcing this change on us. Rather than being evidence led, which would suggest that Portsmouth should not be part of the process at all, we are concerned the Government will press ahead with these proposed damaging changes.\nIf Local Government Reorganisation is being forced on the area by the Government, despite it not being referred to in your election manifesto, then the reorganisation process needs to balance the need for financial resilience with community identity. A repeated term you used when we met was how communities ‘anchor’ to an area, where they feel connected for their services and sense of place, and we agree with you.\nFinally, one of the areas that helps cement the identity of Portsmouth is that Portsmouth has a Lord Mayor and has city status, which will be celebrating its centenary in 2026. While the issues of what happens to our city status and the Lord Mayor role in any restructuring might appear small compared to other issues, our city status and civic ceremonial arrangements are very important to our residents and form an important part of the culture, heritage and identity of the city. It would be helpful to clarify as soon as possible how the Lord Mayor for Portsmouth role and our city status can be protected and transferred into any new arrangements.\nCouncillor Steve Pitt\nLeader of the Council\nCabinet Member for Culture, Regeneration & Economic Development",

As a volunteer you'll play an important part in supporting them and sharing the positive news of what we're doing for Portsmouth.\nWhat voluntary roles are there for me?\n-\nOur volunteer deliverers help share our message to their neighbours through our Focus newsletters and leaflets. Many of our deliverers focus on their own road, but if really enjoy being outdoors we can work with you to find the roads you want to deliver to - regularly or just during election time.\n-\nOur policy and ideas are shaped by the conversations we have with residents across the city. Our teams can be seen around the city every week, talking to the people of Portsmouth about what matters to them. Joining one of our canvassing teams means you'll become the face of our positive vision for Portsmouth, talking to people about what we can do to make their lives better.\n-\nWe know that the best way of sharing our message of positivity and optimism for our city is by talking to people. You can help us get hard working Liberal Democrat councillors elected by calling local voters either from the comfort of your home or from one of social phone banking events.\nWe'll guide you every step of the way, helping you know exactly what to say to let people know we're working for them - and to convince them to vote for Lib Dems in their area.\n-\nOur Lib Dem team is busy working for Portsmouth all year round, but they can only do that because of the thousands of people who put their faith in us every election day. On election day, you'll see our team of volunteers all over the city from the early hours until the final vote is counted.\nOur tellers stand outside polling stations, greeting voters with a friendly face and celebrating the power of democracy. Those tellers are supported by our polling day network of deliverers and canvassers, talking to voters and encouraging them to vote - and reminding voters to take ID to vote because of the Conservatives' anti-democracy policies. When 10pm comes around and the final votes have been cast, our volunteers head to the Guildhall to observe the count, making sure your vote and everyone else's vote gets counted fairly and accurately.\nMany of our polling day volunteers first get active by delivering our leaflets, talking to voters on the doorstep, or championing one of our petitions.\n-\nWhile we work to make life better for the people of Portsmouth, we need to make sure we're taking our message to voters in the ways that they feel most comfortable engaging with us. That used to be the doorstep, but more and more voters are relying on social media to hold their politicians to account.\nYou can make a huge difference to our campaigns by simply sharing them on your own social media profiles, adding your own voice to our work. The most persuasive person to deliver a political message is someone a voter already likes and trusts. Reposting our content across Twitter/X, Facebook, Instagram, Bluesky, and TikTok is an easy way of supporting us and letting your network know what the Lib Dems are doing for them.\nIf you want to get more involved, you might want to join our small but dedicated digital team, helping to manage our online presence including our social media accounts and website.\n-\nThe best way to make life better for people who live and work in Portsmouth is by making sure we've got a strong, Lib Dem council making decisions on our behalf - but fighting elections is expensive. Helping us fundraise will help us pay to print leaflets, be visible at events, and bring our campaign to more people. Whether you're an experience fundraiser or you're new to raising money, we'd love you to join us as we organise a range of fundraising events from social events to formal dinners.\nIf you don't want to get involved in events but still want to help us raise the money we need to stand at election time, you can still support us by getting involved in our direct appeals and encouraging people to make a one-off or recurring donation to us.\n-\nOur local party is managed by a volunteer executive committee who give their time because they believe in the difference that Lib Dems make in the council chamber and in Parliament. Our executive committee is elected at our AGM every November with a range of roles available, including roles celebrating diversity and young people.\n-\nBeing a candidate is an empowering and an effective way to bring change to your local area and the UK. If you are passionate about your community, we need people like you.\nWe welcome applications from people from all walks of life: there is no such thing as a typical Lib Dem councillor or MP. We want you to bring your unique background and talents to the Party!\nMaybe you've been doing voluntary work, bringing up a family, or doing a job not directly related to politics, but your experiences and transferable skill will be recognised and can help make a real difference to life in Portsmouth. Represent your community and be the change you want to see.\nYou can find out more about standing for election as a Lib Dem and the support we give our canidates on the national Lib Dem website, or get in touch with us and one of our current councillors will be happy to have a conversation for you about the difference you could make.\nBecome a volunteer today\nWe are so pleased you want to join the team. If you already know how you would like to help, let us know below, if not then you can skip those questions and hit the big yellow 'I'm in' button and someone will be in contact.

You can get involved as much or as little as you like, there is something for everyone.\nAs a first-time campaigner you'll be partnered with an experienced activist who will show you the ropes, answer your questions, and share their own experiences with you. They'll be there to support you to get as involved as you want. For some people, they want to spend their first canvessing session just shadowing an experienced campaigner and seeing what they do, while others will want to jump straight in to talking to voters. We've all been first time campaigners at some point and we'd love you to join us.\n-\nOur volunteers are vital to our success; we can’t win elections without you. Getting involved is an exciting and fulfilling experience, and there's no minimum or limitation on how much you can contribute. There is something for everyone here.\n-\nThere are lots of of ways you can help get more Lib Dems elected, at all levels. From helping write party policy, to standing as a candidate, to delivering a few leaflets.\nFrom stuffing envelopes, to entering data, to making refreshments for other volunteers on a break, a campaign is a team effort and it depends on this important support work.

Standing up for the LGBTQ+ community is a key part of being a Liberal Democrat and speaking up for others will always be at the heart of everything we do. The freedom to live your life as the person that you are, secure in the knowledge that their fundamental rights will be protected, is not a lot to ask.\nBut in our country there are still too many people for whom that is an aspiration.\nOur LGBTQ+ community faces prejudice, discrimination and hostility simply because of who they are. Their health care, their housing, even their education can all be affected. But this weekend Portsmouth Lib Dems, and Lib Dems from around the country, recommitted to the ongoing fight for equality in all areas of life as we passed our 'Free To Be Who You Are' policy paper, setting out an ambitious vision for how our government should deliver a positive future for everyone in the LGBTQ+ community. With Lib Dems in your council and in parliament, we can promise there will always be a strong voice working towards our goal of a society where nobody's life chances are limited or constrained because of who they are.\nWe're proud of our record on standing standing for the LGBTQ+ community in Portsmouth and around the country. As Portsmouth's former Young Person's Champion - speaking up for LGBTQ+ young people in our city - I've seen the impact our support has, including the council's work with young people and our support of Portsmouth Pride's bid to bring UK Pride to our city.\nClaire Udy, Equality and Diversity Officer\nOur party had been pushing to lift the ban on men who have sex with men's ability to donate blood for over 15 years by the time it finally happened in 2021. That is the proud tradition of which we are the keepers. We know there is still a lot to do but each step is important to progress in achieving that free and fair society.\nThe measures we voted through today will mean:\n- Ensuring LGBTQ+ survivors of domestic abuse and hate crime get the support they deserve, including by delivering training for police and support services\n- Ending anti-LGBTQ+ abuse in social care, by commissioning an urgent investigation into anti-LGBTQ+ abuse in social care with recommendations on how to prevent it.\n- Banning medically unnecessary, non-consensual treatments or surgeries for intersex infants and children.\n- Pushing for all integrated care boards in England to immediately remove the requirement for lesbian couples to pay for artificial insemination before accessing NHS-funded IVF services.\n- Banning all forms of conversion “therapies” and practices.\n- Implementing a new LGBTQ+ Action Plan to coordinate cross-government work on delivering LGBTQ+ equality.\nAs Lib Dems we believe that true equality is achieved when individuals are not only free from prejudice and discrimination, but also free to fulfil their potential. So fighting for LGBTQ+ rights is not a choice we make. It is who we are.",

And what a day that would have been. To say to residents who rely on council services, and to the staff who provide those services, that there was no need to cut any services or jobs this year.\nBut the Government put an end to that.\nSince the Government decided to play politics with our economy, inflation has risen to a 40 year high, and the Government grants that fund the council have not kept up with the Conservative created cost-of-living inflation we are now all suffering from.\nThis year the pressures from inflation and pressures on the budget amount to £13.5m extra in social services. Shamefully, the Government have given this council just £7.9m to fund this. While we have had to make tough decisions, such as raising council tax by 4.99% - which is £1.17 a week for the average family - every single penny raised by the council tax rise is going to fund social services, and this is still not enough.\nBut we’ve worked together to put Portsmouth people first.\nPortsmouth Labour Councillors offered local families in need an extra £77,000, which is really good. Local Lib Dem councillors have taken this even further and found an extra £3.8 million to help these families.\nOn top of maintaining the basics like weekly bin-collections and food waste recycling, we are also putting vital money into improving play parks around the city so our children have things to do.\nWe are also investing in a brand-new swimming pool and community hub, funding extra CCTV to tackle ASB hotspots, planting more trees and a gave boost of £265,000 to making cycling easier in Portsmouth.\nCouncils around England are going bankrupt, Portsmouth stands strong.\nWhile neighbouring councils like Conservative-led Bournemouth and Hampshire, and Labour-led Southampton are facing bankruptcy, independent assessors reviewed the council and reported how well the Liberal Democrats are looking after the council finances.\nThis is a strong budget in really difficult times and focuses on making Portsmouth a greener and fairer place to live. This is the first time in at least 30 years that all of the parties on the council backed the Liberal Democrat budget proposals.",

Each of these underpin the party's specific policy proposals.\nLiberty\nWe believe in the right of individuals to make their own decisions about how they live their lives, as long as they do not cause harm to others.\nOur aim is to empower and support individuals to pursue their dreams, to make the most of their talents and to live their lives as they wish.\nEquality\nWe stand by the idea that without equality, true liberty cannot be realised.\nThis requires an active state to: ensure that no one is held back by poverty, poor health, or discrimination, including on the basis of personal characteristics or beliefs; provide access to education or training, and other public services, including a welfare safety net; and guarantee that everyone enjoys equality before the law.\nDemocracy\nWe understand that through democracy, every citizen is empowered to make their voice heard, without being dominated by entrenched interests or the power of money; checks and balances, so that those in power cannot abuse their positions for personal gain or political advantage; and a plurality of views, where no individual or organisation is deterred from speaking truth to power.\nCommunity\nWe believe it is important to provide support for a diverse range of organisations that enable individuals to join together in the pursuit of common goals or activities; and the decentralisation of political and economic power to local government and the nations and regions of the UK.\nHuman Rights\nProviding, defending and promoting equal legal rights for everyone to pursue their lives according to their abilities, wishes and means, with no discrimination on the basis of religion or belief, gender, sexuality, age, ethnicity, disability, or minority status in their country of birth or permanent residency is highly important to us.\nInternationalism\nWe support a fairer and more equal, tolerant and connected world and collaboration with the UK's neighbours - including, ultimately, rejoining the EU - in guaranteeing peace and security, tackling the climate and nature emergencies, standing up to corporate power and spreading prosperity around the world.\nEnvironmentalism\nWe value the importance of acting at home and internationally to promote environmentally sustainable means of production and consumption and living in harmony with nature.\nOur policies\nLearn more about the influence these values have on Liberal Democrat policy",

During lockdown my children did not have access to many learning resources as I was not able to afford educational technology such as laptops and tablets. My son cannot keep up with his peers.\" - The Big Issue, April 2025\n“Scrapping the two-child limit is by far the most cost-effective way to reduce child poverty. It would lift 350,000 children out of poverty overnight and result in 700,000 children living in less deep poverty. If it is not scrapped, the stark reality is that child poverty will be significantly higher at the end of this parliament than when the government took office making this the first time a Labour government would leave such a legacy, and the number of children living in poverty will be at its highest since records began.” - The Child Poverty Action Group, April 2025\nThe Labour Government claims to be committed to championing the rights of disabled people, all while threatening the systems that have been put in place to protect them.\n“Ombudsman’s ruling linked a constituent’s suicide with the flawed personal independence payment (PIP) system, just as Rachel Reeves announced £4.5 billion cuts to PIP spending.\" - Disability News Service, April 2025\n\"New data shows cabinet ministers among MPs at risk as campaign to pressure government over proposed benefit cuts to step up.\" - The Guardian, April 2025\n\"These reforms will only transfer costs and pressure to other government departments including already stretched mental health services by exacerbating poverty and worsening the nation’s physical and mental health.

Although the delays have meant it will never give justice too those women no longer with us. I hope you are compensated for the appalling way you have been treated.” — Just months before Keir Starmer refused to consider compensation as directed by the Parliamentary Ombudsman.\nJust five years ago Stephen Morgan was ready to sign a £57 billion cheque to WASPI women, putting right the failures of previous governments. Now he agrees with Starmer; WASPI women aren't worth the money.\nUnder Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell, Stephen Morgan signed up to Labour's pledge to compensate 3.8 million women who were unfairly affected.

From Winter Fuel Allowance cuts to a tax on employment, and scrapping their much-needed multi-billion pound investment in the green economy to refusing to lift thousands of children out of poverty by scrapping the unfair two child cap on benefits, Stephen Morgan, Amanda Martin and Keir Starmer have shown they just don't care about delivering the change we need.\nBut the Lib Dems will always stand up for people. Portsmouth Lib Dems have pushed forward by getting Portsmouth City Council to agree to Cllr Kimberly Barrett's motion calling for the city's MPs and the Secretary of State to reconsider their party's stance on provided compensation to women affected by changes in their pension age, while Lib Dems in Parliament are continuing to speak up for WASPI women.\nAdd your name to our call for the government to support the WASPI women\nDespite repeatedly promising 1950s women to give them the compensation suggested by the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman, Keir Starmer's Labour government are now turning away from that promise. If you think it's time for Labour to do the right thing add your name to our campaign.\nThese women were judged to be the victims of a gross injustice but instead of righting this wrong, Conservative and Labour MPs decided to sit on their hands.

It shows sewage was dumped into coastlines on 477 separate occasions in 2023.\nThis is a shocking 54% rise in the duration of sewage spills compared to the previous year, showing how the sewage scandal has worsened under the Conservative government’s watch.\nSewage was dumped into England’s rivers over 460,000 times for a total of over 3.6 million hours in 2023.\nIt comes after the Liberal Democrats local election success where the party campaigned relentlessly on sewage and the local environment. The party gained over 100 seats and control of two councils, beating the Conservatives and coming second for the first time since 1996. Locally, the Liberal Democrats retained their position on the council and was the only party to gain in the south of the city, taking Eastney and Craneswater from the Conservatives and wiping out the Conservative Party in Portsmouth South.\nThe Liberal Democrats have led the way in campaigning against sewage dumping for years. The party is calling for strict measures including replacing Ofwat with a tougher regulator, a ban on bonuses for water company bosses whose firms have dumped sewage into waterways and the declaration of a national environmental emergency.\nLast year, the Liberal Democrat-run Stockport Council became the first Council in the country to launch an official sewage inquiry. The inquiry asked for evidence from the local water companies and was chaired by Liberal Democrat councillor Lisa Smart.\nOn doorstep after doorstep, people in Portsmouth told me how furious they were that filthy sewage had been pumped into their rivers and waterways - they want to send this Conservative government a message.

Now it's easier to do the right thing.\nAfter collecting and careful sorting, the plastic is turned into pellets and re-used in new packaging in a proper, traceable process within the UK and not abroad. (Other Council’s have allegedly claimed to collect and recycle but have actually been found to have passed plastic waste to contractors who take it to landfill.)\nYou can look on the Council’s website for more details and get the specific locations of the plastic banks here. If the scheme is popular, more mixed-plastic banks will be installed in even more places.\nBut mixed-plastic recycling banks are just another step in the Lib Dem-led Council's practical but much more ambitious vision to ‘green’ the city via a series of cost-effective, forward-looking programmes.\nFor example, on recycling, the long-term plan is to build a complete, new waste-sorting facility locally. This will bring down recycling costs, create local jobs and enable doorstep recycling of even more items.\nBut there is much more going on. For example, did you know, Lib Dem-led Portsmouth is the UK’s number 1 Council for solar generation – that’s saving the city a fortune this year.\nIt’s also the 3rd best for electric vehicle charging availability, is insulating new council homes to high, “passive house” standards to permanently address fuel poverty issues and has many other green transport and housing initiatives under way.\nSo, whilst others are talking, Portsmouth Lib Dems control of the Council is making positive change happen – and, importantly, doing so in ways that also represent good value for local Council Tax payers. That way, it is financially as well as environmentally sustainable.\nAll this sensible ‘green’ action reflects that the Lib Dems’ underlying belief that the each generation is responsible for the fate of our planet - a belief that, unlike some others, is written into the inspiring opening of our constitution.\nIf you’d like work with us to help make our city a fairer, greener and more caring place even faster, please get in touch at office@portsmouthlibdems.org.uk .",

With a UK average of 17 per cent fitting into this category as of 2022, a rise from 12 per cent in 2000, an impressive 59 per cent of Portsmouth residents now fall into this category, with only Brighton and Hove and Greater London having a higher volume.\nWhen the time comes to purchase a new vehicle, replacing a petrol or diesel car with an electric vehicle is one of the ways people can help to reduce air pollution in the city and improve air quality for everyone. In Portsmouth, there are currently around 100 electric vehicle charge points across the city, in car parks and streets. On-street residential electric charging points work on a pay-as-you-go basis, drawing their electricity from lampposts with availability 24 hours a day.\nCllr Lynne Stagg, Cabinet Member for Traffic and Transportation, said: \"I am thrilled to see Portsmouth's efforts to expand our electric vehicle accessibility be recognised in this manner. As we continue to encourage our residents and visitors to choose more sustainable travel options in a bid to improve air quality for ourselves and our city, we hope the number of electric charging points across Portsmouth will encourage people that need to replace their vehicles to consider an electric car.\n\"Electric vehicles are just part of the solution, however, and I'd urge everyone to make walking, cycling and taking public transport their first choice for short journeys.\"\nTo discover an electric charging point near you, please click here.",

With schools having to send children home with 'packed dinner', it is time to scrap the cap and give parents in Portsmouth the help they need to keep food on the table.\nSince 2017, the Conservative Government has cut off support for families with more than two children.\nData provided by the End Child Poverty Coalition shows that removing the cap would lift 250,000 children across the UK out of poverty.\nIn Portsmouth 14,621 children live in poverty, more than a third of the children in our city.\n12% of all children in our city are impacted by the Tories' two child cap.\nThe fact is that for many parents, when raising a child in 2024 there's just not enough left at the end of the month. A single parent working for an average income will face a shortfall of 13% on the cost it takes to raise a child, and an out-of-work family will have less than half of what they need. Inevitably, this pushes children into poverty when they deserve the best start in life.\nThis bodged cap on support for children has left working families high and dry with the spiraling cost of living.\nRecent poverty figures have to be a wake up call. For too many parents in Portsmouth it is impossible to put enough food on the table. The cap has failed and it must go. It's time to scrap the cap.\nCharlie Murphy, Parliamentary Candidate for Portsmouth South\nNeither the city's Labour or Conservative MPs are calling for the two child cap to be scrapped. It's really important to parents across the city, as for many it's the difference between their children getting what they need and going to bed hungry.\nJoin our call to scrap the cap and give Portsmouth parents the help they need in the cost of living.\nScrap the Two Child Benefit Cap.\nLiberal Democrats call for an end to Conservatives’ two child limit as one in three children in Portsmouth live in poverty.",

We need to face the music” – Liberal Democrat Charlie Murphy to represent Portsmouth South at the General Election\nLocal campaigner Charlie Murphy will stand to represent Portsmouth South for the Liberal Democrats at the next election.\nCharlie, who is from Stamshaw and works in housing and construction, has lived in the city for 20 years.\nOn news of his selection, Charlie said:\n“I am thrilled to represent the city where I grew up. I am standing because I am fed up with our city being taken for granted. With each of the crises we’ve seen over the past decade, Portsmouth has been hit hard.\nI’m sick of our city being an afterthought. From dentists right up to QA Hospital our NHS is broken and needs more doctors and nurses trained locally. The botched Conservative Brexit deal is damaging our port and our relationship with Europe is in need of repair. The cost-of-living is pushing hard-working people into poverty across the city, all while the Conservatives cut vital funds such as the Household Support Fund which must be ringfenced. The list goes on and on, it just feels like nothing works anymore.\nAs an island city, we are uniquely exposed to the effects of climate change. Our country needs a clear plan to fight climate change, but the Conservatives are approving new oil and gas drilling, and Labour have already broken their promise on green investment.”\nCharlie also talked about his plan to focus on the environment and climate change:\n“Climate change is happening now. We need to face the music. Water companies are turning local rivers into open sewers which flow into the Solent and pollute our beaches. Worse yet, Conservative MPs have voted to let them continue. In the same week when we learn our planet has exceeded 1.5C of warming for a year, Labour scrapped on their promise to invest in green energy and technology.\nBoth Labour and the Conservatives are asleep at the wheel while we approach an environmental catastrophe.”\nOn the Liberal Democrats’ record of delivery at Portsmouth City Council, Charlie said:\n“Across our city, people elect hard-working Liberal Democrats to represent them. Despite the Conservative Government bankrupting councils across the country, the Liberal Democrats have protected the city’s finances with responsible management.\nShoring up our city’s finances has not stopped Liberal Democrat councillors from delivering for the city. Portsmouth now enjoys improved bus services with simpler fares, more funding for public transport improvements, a new GP surgery and swimming pool in Eastney, more green jobs and less pollution at our International Port, and huge progress towards a climate-resilient seafront with the new sea defences.\nPeople in Portsmouth know that Labour and the Conservatives playing politics in Westminster doesn’t help them. Instead, they elect local Liberal Democrats who work hard for them all year round.”",

On this occasion, the best of human nature has met the worst of it.\nIncreasingly I have come to feel very uneasy about the prospect of British weapons being used. The time has come to send a stern message to the Israeli government on this.\nThe Government must end British arms sales to Israel with immediate effect.\nThe Liberal Democrats have had a strong line on this conflict from day one, led by our Foreign Affairs Spokesperson Layla Moran, the first MP of Palestinian descent.\nThe only long-term solution is one which permits two states to live at peace with each other.\nWe must send a strong message to the Israeli government that we will not stand by in support of this conflict any longer while these tragedies persist.\nThe UK must redouble its efforts for an immediate bilateral ceasefire now.\nThis ceasefire must last for an extended period which opens up the border and makes it safe for aid to get in, both for aid workers and those in need of the aid themselves.\nI hope the Conservative Government will see sense and stop arms sales to Israel, and that the Israeli government will listen to growing international pressure.",

Coastal flooding is generally predictable, and this allows the City Council to plan for it and respond.\nOur heartfelt thanks go out to the City Council workers who acted swiftly and professionally to protect the city. Flood gates were closed and the new coastal defences performed as expected, which kept Portsmouth and Southsea safe.\nWe are fortunate to have brand new sea defences in Portsmouth and Southsea. £100 million of funding from central government was won for Portsmouth in 2020 thanks to hard work by council officers and Lib Dem Councillor Hugh Mason. Progress on these sea defences is still underway, but these floods have demonstrated both how the defences are effective and why they are needed.\nNevertheless, flooding can be worrying for local residents and visitors. While everyone is safe and any damage appears to be very limited, councillors wanted to share information about flooding in the city and where you can sign up for advanced warning when it's available.\nBelow you can find links to resources published by the City Council about flooding in Portsmouth, including planning, response strategy, and where to sign up for warnings and updates.\nIf you have any problems arising from flooding or any other issues with your local area, you can always contact us as your local councillors.\nIf there is a threat to life or a serious threat to property, dial 999.\nDid you find this information useful?

Many local companies have benefited from the relationship with Halifax since it was established in 1759, including with the recent decision by Canada's Liberal government to build 15 Type 26 Frigates in the city.\nEd Davey has also called on Keir Starmer to fly to Canada this week as a show of support, as Trump continues to threaten the imposition of tariffs on Canadian products - as well as on steel and aluminium imports, including from the UK, later this week. Trump has also continued to make alarming comments about wanting to turn Canada into America’s ‘51st State’.\nIt’s vital for both British and Canadian security that the Commonwealth allies “stand strong together”, Davey said – urging Starmer to show a “united front” against Donald Trump’s “senseless” threats against Canada’s sovereignty and economy.\nRight now all Canadians are being asked to serve in their own ways. We’re all being called to stand up for each other and for the Canadian way of life. So let me ask you: who’s ready? Who’s ready to stand up for Canada with me? Hundred per cent. Yes, yes. Yes, Canada. The Liberal Party is united and strong and ready to fight to build an even better country.\nMark Carney, Leader of the Canadian Liberal Party\nUK Lib Dem leader Ed Davey said:\n“I would like to express my warmest congratulations to the new leader of Canada, Mark Carney. We treasure Canada’s historic relationship with the UK and I look forward to our two nations’ ties becoming ever stronger during your premiership.\n“It’s vital for both British and Canadian security that we stand strong together. With global instability rising, it’s never been more important to show a united front with our Commonwealth friends – and to stand together against Trump senselessly turning the screws on his allies, whether that’s Canada, the UK or Europe.\n“Responding to the trade war along the North American border, our Prime Minister must stand in solidarity against Trump’s bullying and visit Ottawa in a joint show of strength. Starmer must be clear that Trump’s threats against Commonwealth nations’ sovereignty are unacceptable.”\nWe treasure Canada’s historic relationship with the UK and I look forward to our two nations’ ties becoming ever stronger during your premiership.\nEd Davey MP, Leader of the Liberal Democrats",

This demonstrates how important it is for us to have two of these ships, it is essential for British security that we can mobilise one even if the other fails.\nGrant Shapps needs to think again and confirm that HMS Prince of Wales is safe.”\nThe aircraft carriers are the largest ships based at HM Naval Base Portsmouth, which employs tens of thousands of people in the city.\nLast week, reports emerged in the national media that the Conservative Government is considering selling or mothballing HMS Prince of Wales. The aircraft carrier only entered service less than five years ago at a cost of £3.5 billion to the taxpayer.\nCouncillor Steve Pitt, the Leader of Portsmouth City Council said:\n“The Royal Navy are a huge employer in Portsmouth. They are critical for the city. The loss of HMS Prince of Wales would be devastating, and a real disappointment given we only welcomed her home less than five years ago.”\nUnnamed sources have issued contradictory statements on the issue to the national media, and the Liberal Democrats have called on Grant Shapps to clear up the uncertainty and guarantee that HMS Prince of Wales will remain in service.\nYou can read the full letter to the Secretary of State for Defence below:",
