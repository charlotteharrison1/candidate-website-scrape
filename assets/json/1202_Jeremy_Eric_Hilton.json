Jeremy Hilton said: “I welcome the decision of the planning committee to unanimously refuse the planning application for a massive waste incinerator at Javelin Park. Liberal Democrats have opposed the project from the beginning.\n“We have tried to stop this project a number of times in the last few years by proposing motions at council and formal challenges to cabinet decisions to end the project.\n“On every occasion the Tories refused to listen to us. Under the reckless leadership of Mark Hawthorne the Tories just arrogantly pressed on with the waste incinerator project. They even agreed to sign a £500m contract with Urbaser Balfour Beatty ahead of the planning decision, leaving the council contractually committed to millions of pounds of costs in compensation if the project is cancelled.\n“It is quite clear from the decision of the planning committee that the incinerator project should be dead. The Tories cannot be trusted to sort out alternative plans. Mark Hawthorne should apologise to the people of Gloucestershire. It is clear that we now need a new leader of the county council to take us forward into the future.”\nEnds…",

Already some roads in Kingsholm have a residents’ parking permit scheme.\nThe county council is also keen to find out what people think of on street electric vehicle charging points in the area. As part of the consultation, possible locations will be included for new on street EV charging points in these review zones for residents to consider. These charging points will be the first of 500 double charging points (1000 charging points in total) around the county, allowing those without a driveway to consider moving to an electric vehicle to reduce their carbon footprint.\nCounty Cllr Jeremy Hilton (Lib Dem) for Kingsholm, said: “The parking survey carried out in 2020 showed that a number of streets in Kingsholm were severely congested with parked cars and some roads were near to their capacity. Many residents do not have off street parking and find it very difficult at times to park their cars near to their homes. I’m therefore pleased that the county council is now carrying out a public consultation on parking in my division. I encourage everyone to have their say.”\nKingsholm City Councillor Angela Conder (Lib Dem) said: “There is no easy solution to managing on-street parking in Kingsholm, but we believe that the county council can do better. We are also interested in what people think about the location of the proposed electric vehicle charging points. Are they in the right place?”\nView the plans and give feedback online at www.gloucestershire.gov.uk/parkingreviews\nParking Review Process\nEach parking review follows a similar process as outlined below:\n- Scheme inception – initial data gathering and discussions with local stakeholders;\n- Informal consultation – consultation with local residents and businesses to find out if local people find parking a problem, if they would like to see changes considered, and if so, what changes.\n- Statutory consultation – a formal consultation process where we present a detailed proposed scheme. Feedback to this stage will be used to decide if any changes are made.\n- Implementation (if appropriate) – launch of new scheme.\nThe consultation questionnaire will be open for comments until the 15th October 2021.",

This time the Tory run council plans to axe a further 60 jobs. At this rate, the council will cease to exist in future – its vanishing before us. The council is already running a skeleton service compared to eight years ago.\nIn 2009 the council employed 432 members of staff providing much needed service to the people of Gloucester. With this round of job losses, the number employed will be just 187.\nAlready services are suffering with projects being delayed or not done at all. The delayed work on the bus station and failure to deliver the Kings Quarter project are two high profile examples of projects suffering from overburdened staff.\nThe annual hours lost from the proposed job cuts will be 102,000 per year. The total loss of annual hours will be 417,000 compared to 2009. You can imagine a lot of additional work could be done if we reinstated the lost hours.\nThe council’s project to cut these 60 jobs is called ‘Together Gloucester’. A more appropriate name might have been ‘Goodbye Gloucester’. Certainly, many loyal members of staff will be reluctantly saying goodbye to the council fairly soon.\nTo cut these jobs, there will be major restructuring of the council and staff will have to apply for new generic jobs where they will have to double up on their responsibilities. Specialist technical work could be carried out by less experienced staff. Everyone will become a ‘jack of all trades’.\nLiberal Democrats are concerned about the council’s ability to run important services in future. The council collects our bins, has responsibility to find homes for the homeless, it protects our built environment, manages our parks and opens spaces, approves planning applications and ensures that taxis are properly licensed.\nThere comes a point where there just won’t be enough people employed for the council to carry out its statutory duties.\nThe blame for this situation we are now in must lie 100% with the Conservatives who run the council and their government who both seem wedded to perpetual austerity.\nGovernment funding this next year is being cut by £1.755m. This is totally unfair, but our Tory council just take the grant cuts on the chin and we all suffer and good staff become unemployed.\nI believe the leader of the council needs to get on the train to London and lobby hard for a better funding deal for Gloucester City Council. He hasn’t in the past. Is it because he is too timid to fight for Gloucester?\nThe cuts must stop. If we carry on with job losses year after year as we have done, no one will be working for the council in six years. Our historic city will no longer have a council of its own.",

The Lib Dems are calling for a new City Plan for Gloucester, which will be an up to date set of polices that will become the development framework for Gloucester for the next few years.\nLib Dem leader, Cllr. Jeremy Hilton (Kingsholm & Wotton) said: “The last adopted development plan dates back to 1983. Its 33 years old and a lot has changed in Gloucester since then. Both Labour and Conservative administrations, in that time, have failed to get updates to the plan adopted as required by the government. We are asking the cabinet member for housing & planning to report back to council in September on how he intends to deliver a new City Plan. We want it adopted as a matter of urgency.”\nThe current timetable for approving the new City Plan was for it to be approved by council in time to go to the planning inspector in the winter of 2016 for adoption in 2017. Liberal Democrats are concerned that the delays in approving a new City Plan could allow a developers to override current polices arguing they are out of date, despite many being formally being ‘saved’ by the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government in 2007.\nCllr. David Brown (Hucclecote), Lib Dem spokesperson for housing & planning said: “The city council have a timetable to deliver the City Plan but due to the delay in adopting the Joint Core Strategy (JCS) it is now woefully outdated. We need the council to be able to work with developers from a position of strength, with a clear plan for the city, a plan that best benefits current and future residents. For that we need a City Plan that is fit for the future sooner rather than later.”\nThe new City Plan should be a development document that sits beneath the JCS. It must explain how the council will implement the spatial vision and strategic objectives in the JCS up to the year 2031 and provide criteria that it will apply when considering planning applications for different types of buildings or other development.",

Lib Dems have described the ‘garden waste tax’ as ‘daylight robbery’. They blame the Conservative council and government in equal proportion.\nThe current charge for garden waste collection is £36 per year. The charge was introduced in 2011 to cover the cost of collection on this non-statutory service. Lib Dems discovered in 2016 that the council was profiteering from the collection by around £6 per bin, making a profit of £110,000 a year. The Tories now propose to increase the charge to £44.\nLib Dem leader, Jeremy Hilton said: “Last year we tried to reduce the charge to £31 to just cover the cost of collection. Both Labour and Tory councillors rejected our proposal. Now the Conservatives plan to increase the charge to £44. This is a tax on responsible householders who recycle their garden waste. It’s daylight robbery.”\nLib Dem Deputy leader, Declan Wilson said: “The council’s finances are dire and the Tories are penalising responsible householders. We should be encouraging recycling not taxing it. The Tories will be making a profit of £13 on every green bin. This a profit margin of 30%. Local gardeners are going to have to empty their pockets to cover the financial mismanagement of the council by the Conservatives. It’s unfair.”\nLiberals choose Linda Castle for the Longlevens By-election\nLocal resident Linda Castle has been selected by the Liberal Democrats to be its candidate in the Longlevens by-election.\nLinda has lived in Longlevens almost her whole life.\nThe married mother of two, who works as an IT trainer for the NHS, grew up in Longlevens, went to Longlevens infant, junior and secondary schools and raised her family in Longlevens.\nThe Longlevens by-election will be held on Thursday November 3 following the death of Conservative city councillor Jim Porter in August.\nLinda said: “I am so proud to be standing for election to represent Longlevens – the area where I grew up.\n“I know the area well and I am determined to speak up for Longlevens residents at the city council.\n“I am campaigning for improvements to our roads and pavements in Longlevens, which are in a mess due to inaction by the Conservatives at Shire Hall.\n“I am determined to make sure the proposals by the Boundary Commission to put Longlevens back into Gloucester are adopted.\n“I am also fighting to ensure that residents in Longlevens do not suffer from the effects of thousands of new homes being built on the outskirts of Gloucester, such as pressure on the local road network, doctors’ surgeries and schools.”\nAfter leaving school Linda worked for the CEGB in finance before joining the NHS.\nIn recent years Linda has been involved in the community campaign over the expansion of the Oxstalls campus and also wants to see the former Bishop’s College site retained for educational use.\nLinda was also treasurer of the Gloucester Dyslexia Association for four years. She is married to Ian, whose father was a Liberal councillor in Tewkesbury.\nShe was a member of a residents’ campaign group that opposed the expansion of the Oxstalls campus by the University of Gloucestershire. Linda also wants to see the Bishops’ College site retained for educational use.\nCouncillor Jeremy Hilton, leader of Gloucester Liberal Democrats, said: “Linda will make an excellent councillor for Longlevens on the city council.\n“She is a first class candidate and knows Longlevens very well having lived there for many years. She is full of enthusiasm and energy and is the breath of fresh air that Longlevens needs.\n“We’ve been speaking to residents and they are pleased that Linda is interested in hearing what they have to say.\n“Only Linda can beat the Conservatives in Longlevens and by supporting the Liberal Democrats on November 3, local residents can send a really strong message to the Conservatives in Gloucester that they have had enough of the way they run the city and county councils.\n“The Conservatives have run out of steam in Longlevens and Gloucester. Regeneration has stalled and our city is stagnating.”\nLonglevens set to return to Gloucester\nLonglevens will be represented by Gloucester’s MP if proposals by the Boundary Commission are approved.\nThe Liberal Democrats launched a petition earlier this year to show the strength of feeling that Longlevens should be represented by Gloucester’s MP rather than Tewkesbury’s.\nA couple of hundred local people signed the petition – both online and in the Lib Dem Spotlight newsletters – saying identified more with Gloucester than Tewkesbury.\nAmong the comments posted by people signing the petition on the change.org website, include: “This ludicrous situation has to change. Longlevens is part and parcel of GLOUCESTER, not Tewkesbury.”\nAnother said: “I live within the City of Gloucester and wish to be represented by the City MP. It makes no sense to be represented by a town MP 12 miles away.”\nToday the Boundary Commission, the independent agency that reviews Parliamentary boundaries, published its draft proposals to cut the number of MPs in England by 32 to 501.\nIn Gloucester, the Boundary Commission has proposed putting Longlevens back into Gloucester and moving the Quedgeley Fieldcourt and Quedgeley Severn Vale wards into the Stroud constituency.\nCouncillor Jeremy Hilton, the leader of Gloucester Liberal Democrat leader, said: “I am really pleased that the Boundary Commission is proposing to move Longlevens back into Gloucester.\n“Residents in Longlevens identify with Gloucester, so it is only right that local people are represented by the city’s MP.\n“I am also pleased the Boundary Commission has not resurrected previous plans to move the heart of Gloucester, including the cathedral and city centre, into the Forest of Dean.”\nMr Hilton said earlier this year the Conservatives had appeared lukewarm to his suggestion and comments about the Boundary Commission’s proposals supported that view.\n“In the summer Tewkesbury MP Laurence Robertson was against moving Longlevens back to Gloucester and Richard Graham was not bothered about reclaiming Longlevens,” he said.\n“The Liberal Democrats plan to make submissions to the Boundary Commission to ensure its initial proposals to include Longlevens are adopted. However, we will look closely at the south of the city and see if we can propose a solution that retains Quedgeley as well.”\nWe should vote to remain- by Jeremy Hilton\nForty-one years ago I voted yes to stay in the Common Market. I intend to vote yes again on Thursday with a positive vote to REMAIN in the European Union. A union of 28 countries working together peacefully to sort out issues of cross border importance, such as trade, the environment and security.\nMy primary reason in voting yes in 1975 was to make sure that European countries sorted out their differences around a table and not on a battlefield. I wanted to live my life in peace. I have never regretted my decision. I have seen the Common Market of nine countries grow into the European Union of twenty-eight.\nIn 1975 the continent was split between western democracies and socialist dictatorships. Spain, Greece & Portugal were becoming democracies and joined the EU in the early 1980s. Now the EU has a population of 508 million living in peace with each other and with governments co-operating over issues that affect us all. As Winston Churchill said “Jaw Jaw is better than War War”.\nI have been concerned about the whole tone of the referendum campaign, particularly when I listen to those arguing to leave. I also think to myself; ‘I want my country back’. But, what I certainly don’t want is the UK run by a right wing clique of people who feed on people’s fears and concerns. Who stir up xenophobia and blame others for our problems.\nI grew up in a country that was proud of itself and was an open and free society, working with other nations within international organisations such as the UN, NATO, the Commonwealth and the EU. I believe that if we leave the EU it will be a step backwards. We could see our country fall apart with Scotland leaving the UK and “Little England” left just floating in the mid-Atlantic with few friends.\nAs individuals we would lose our right to live and work anywhere in the EU. Our European Health Insurance Card will become invalid. Many of us will suffer from loss of work or earnings. Taxes may rise. We shall probably experience years of regret that we isolated ourselves from our friends on the continent.\nI also want to address the nonsense espoused by leave campaigners that the EU is undemocratic, this is untrue. Every five years we elect MEP’s to represent us in the European Parliament, which amends and approves legalisation that the Council of Ministers’ support. The Council of Ministers includes an elected representative from every government. The European Commission acts in a similar way to our very own Civil Service.\nI hope that everyone will think very carefully about the way they are going to vote on Thursday. This is not the time to bash the Tory government, we can do that at the ballot box at the next general election. This is a time to vote for our children’s future. In my view it will be much better for them if we remain in the EU.\nLiberal Democrats on city council announce spokespersons\nThe seven Liberal Democrats councillors on Gloucester City Council met at the weekend to elect their leader and deputy leader, plus other group positions.\nCllr. Jeremy Hilton (Kingsholm & Wotton) will remain the group leader and his deputy will be Cllr. Declan Wilson (Hucclecote).\nJeremy Hilton: “We have a magnificent group of seven councillors and it will be our job to provide constructive opposition to the Conservative administration. We have a group with four new members and we have lots of fresh ideas on how we can make Gloucester a better place. Regeneration, housing and the environment will be our priorities.”\nDeclan Wilson said: “Before the election we drew up an action plan for Gloucester with a dozen ideas to make Gloucester a better city. We intend to promote this agenda on the council. We shall oppose the Tories when it sensible to do so and work with the other groups when it is in the best interest of Gloucester.”\nEnds…\nGroup shadow spokespersons\n- Leader and Regeneration & Economy – Jeremy Hilton\n- Deputy Leader and Performance & Resources – Declan Wilson\n- Communities & Neighbourhoods – Howard Hyman\n- Environment – Isabel Brazil\n- Housing & Planning – David Brown\n- Culture & Leisure – Joanne Brown\n- Scrutiny – Emily Ryall\nIsabel Brazil & Jeremy Hilton to contest Kingsholm & Wotton for the Lib Dems\nIsabel Brazil & Jeremy Hilton will contest the Kingsholm and Wotton ward for the Liberal Democrats at the city council elections on May 5th.\nThere will be all out elections for the city council on new ward boundaries with the number of councillors going up from 36 to 39.

Kingsholm and Wotton is a great place to live and work and I will miss being one of the councillors for the area.\nIsabel Brazil lives in Edwy Parade and knows the local area very well. Her late father Peter Brazil was a Lib Dem councillor on Tewksbury Borough Council.\nShe said: “I am delighted to have the chance to serve Kingsholm and Wotton. I will work hard for the area and I will always put Kingsholm and Wotton first.”\nJeremy Hilton said: “Isabel Brazil will make an excellent councillor. I am pleased to have her as my running mate.

I hope the voters will elect the both of us on 5th May.\nLib Dems call for removal of “tacky’ adverts\nLiberal Democrat councillors on Gloucester City Council are to call for the removal of all adverting boards on roundabouts within the city boundaries. Jeremy Hilton and David Brown will lead a debate at the city council, when it next meets on 19th November.\nLiberal Democrats are critical that the decision to sanction the installation of advertising boards by the Tory Cabinet Member for the Environment, Cllr. Jim Porter was done without consultation with ward councillors and the local community.\nCllr. Jeremy Hilton (LD: Kingsholm & Wotton) said. “These advertising boards are blighting well kept roundabouts in Gloucester. They are visually intrusive and unnecessary. The council get a paltry £10,000 income per year from this advertising. We do not need our historic city cheapened in this way. Lib Dems are demanding that all advertising on roundabouts are removed immediately.”\nCllr. David Brown (LD: Hucclecote) who will be seconding the motion to remove the advert boards said: “A number of residents in Barnwood and Hucclecote have complained to me by email, telephone and in person. Most point out that adverts are designed to attract our attention and that is the last thing a driver needs when negotiating a roundabout, and I agree. Others say that the signs are tacky and people are concerned that even more will pop up around the area.”\nEnds….\nNotice of motion for full council\n“This council notes with great disappointment the Cabinet Member for the Environment’s decision to sanction the installation of advertising boards on roundabouts across the city.\nThis council believes these advertising boards are tacky and unsightly; blighting some well kept roundabouts.\nThe council also believes these advertising boards could be a distraction to motorists and present an unnecessary hazard to motorcyclists.\nThis council, therefore, requests the Cabinet Member for the Environment to instruct officers of this council to have these advertising boards removed immediately from roundabouts within the city council boundaries.”\nProposed by Jeremy Hilton\nSeconded by David Brown\n“Let’s get devolution right for Gloucestershire” say Lib Dems\nOn the day Gloucestershire submits a detailed bid for more devolved powers and responsibilities, which means greater local control and influence over resources and priorities. The Liberal Democrats issue their own ‘Statement of Principles’, on which support for a devolution package will only then be determined.\nThe Liberal Democrat agreed principles are as follows:\n1) Liberal Democrats believe that devolution needs to be created by locally led processes and are mindful that devolution as it currently stands to a model set out by Government is not real devolution at all.\n2) Liberal Democrats will only support devolution if Government is genuinely interested in giving power back to local communities, but not if the intention of Government is simply to pass cost-cutting measures onto local authorities under the façade of devolution.\n3) The new responsibilities handed down from Government to Gloucestershire must come with full powers to decide, manage and innovate at a local level.\n4) The Government must ensure that adequate funding is guaranteed now and in the future to support good quality services for residents of the county.\n5) The government must ensure that the new arrangements allow for additional funds to be raised locally or through other legitimate means to support enhanced service provision if that is decided by locally elected members.\n6) The governance arrangements must be cross-party and fully reflect the political proportionality that exists on the councils that make up the new governing board that will oversee the new devolved services.\n7) We will not support the establishment of a metro mayor. Governance of the new additional arrangements must not be handed over to a single person as we believe collective responsibility across all political parties, provides for better services.\n8) If we want democracy alongside devolution, then, we ultimately need a fairer voting system for local government in the form of STV.\nLeader of the Liberal Democrats, Cllr. Jeremy Hilton (LD: Kingsholm and Wotton) said:\n“We are very much in favour of devolving more powers and responsibilities to local areas, but the deal must be right and it must be in the interests of Gloucestershire as a whole.\n“Our ‘Statement of Principles’ are more than just a wish list they are key to us supporting the ‘We are Gloucestershire’ bid, which I believe is being signed and submitted today.\n“There are a number of factors to be considered and the last thing we should be doing is to look at devolution through rose-tinted spectacles. While devolution presents a number of exciting opportunities, it will not be easy to commit to achieving better outcomes at further reduced costs and this ought to be fully realised.\n“Gloucestershire County Council is in no overall control and it is therefore vital that not only public sector partners are consulted, but that all political parties who are a part of the public sector have a say in what is being proposed and what will eventually be agreed.\n“In any deal, the question is: who holds the cards? It is important that through the negotiation process of devolution we don’t allow Government to hold all the cards.\n“I believe our ‘Statement of Principles’ goes some way to making sure that when we are in a position to agree a deal it will ultimately be the right one for Gloucestershire.”\nENDS\nNotes:\n1. Ten of Gloucestershire’s public sector partners have already come together including Gloucestershire Councils, the Police & Crime Commissioner, GFirst Local Enterprise Partnership and Gloucestershire Clinical Commissioning Group to have one conversation with Government about how, through devolution, one can achieve better outcomes and reduced costs.\nA Strong Liberal Democrat Group to Fight Back across Gloucestershire\nA strong team of Liberal Democrat County Councillors who will work hard for the residents of the county and also keep a close eye on those decisions being made by a Conservative administration where there is no overall control has today been announced by re-elected Liberal Democrat Group Leader, Cllr. Jeremy Hilton (LD: Kingsholm & Wotton).\nCllr. Hilton said: “Following the Liberal Democrat County Group’s Annual General Meeting held on Friday 15th May 2015, I’m pleased to announce that our strong team of Shadow Cabinet Members are as follows:\nFinance & Change – Cllr.

Dobie also said: “The recent national and local election results make it more important than ever to field a well-led, challenging and effective opposition team. I am confident that the Liberal Democrats, who are the prime opposition party at the County Council, have such a team.”\nThe Liberal Democrats six red lines\nThe Liberal Democrats outlined six ‘red lines’ during the election campaign covering: education, the economy, tax, health, public sector pay and the environment:\n1) Invest an extra £2.5bn in education – benefitting 11.5 million pupils aged 2-19\n2) Invest £8bn a year by 2020 in the NHS – benefitting 53.9 million people in England\n3) £2.7bn of pay rises for public sector workers – benefitting 5.4 million workers\n4) Cut taxes by £400 for working people – benefitting 30 million individuals\n5) Introduce a ‘stability budget’ in the first 50 days – benefitting the entire UK population\n6) Fight climate change and protect nature – benefitting the entire UK population\nVote Liberal Democrat in Gloucester and give Nick Clegg the power to deliver these top six priorities",

As our senior Scottish MP in the cabinet, Danny started his speech by thanking everyone who helped in the Scottish Referendum, in support of the No campaign. He also reaffirmed Liberal Democrat policy that we should have votes for 16 & 17 year olds in all elections as they did in the referendum.\nDanny said Liberal Democrats should be proud that we gave the country strong government in 2010 at a time when we needed it most. He reminded delegates that Labour had bankrupted the country and that they should never be trusted to run the country by themselves again.\nSince the Liberal Democrats had been in government, 27 million people had benefited from income tax cuts by the raising of the threshold to £10,500. This is something David Cameron said could not be done during the 2010 election campaign. Danny Alexander said we would raise the tax free threshold to £12,500 in the next parliament. This could only be guaranteed to be done fairly by Liberal Democrats being in government next time.\nDanny Alexander said Liberal Democrats would borrow less than Labour and cut public spending less than the Tories.

This means there are 3.5 million smaller private rental homes which legally do not have to have them. The Government passed a law in 2013 which would require all private landlords to provide smoke alarms. However, this has gone out to consultation and has not yet been brought into force.\nFire and Rescue Authorities in England and Wales are calling for the law to be enacted so all private landlords are obliged to install them. They also want electrical wiring to be inspected annually – in the same way landlords are obliged to obtain gas safety certificates every year.\nThe call comes as latest figures show more than 200 people die in fires in their homes every year. (This figure covers both rental and owner occupier properties.) Householders are at least four times more likely to die in a fire if they do not have a working smoke alarm.\nFire and Rescue Authorities are taking a lead by giving out free alarms and launching safety awareness campaigns. However, given the tough austerity climate, they argue it must be down to private landlords to ensure alarms are installed.\nMandatory smoke alarms is set to be a key issue at the LGA’s annual fire conference in Gateshead, from March 10-11th. The call forms a central part of the LGA’s key report ‘The Fire and Rescue Service: Making our Nation Safer’, which is being launched today (Saturday). This document sets out a blueprint for the next government, with a series of proposals for how fire and rescue services can improve fire safety and save the public purse money.\nCllr Jeremy Hilton, Chair of the LGA’s Fire Services Management Committee, said:\n“Many people will be shocked that most landlords are not obliged to install smoke alarms. The current laws are outdated and inadequate – and without question lives are being put at risk.\n“While the majority of private landlords are reputable and voluntarily install alarms, there are a small minority who don’t, needlessly putting lives at risk. They have a duty of care to ensure their tenants are safe.\n“This is why we are calling on the Government to enact the law and ensure all private landlords install smoke alarms – and save hundreds of lives every year.\n“A working smoke alarm can make the difference between life and death and should be seen as every bit as essential as a lock on the front door. By spending just a few pounds, landlords can save lives.\n“In the meantime, we would urge anyone who hasn’t got one fitted already to make sure they are not needlessly putting themselves at risk of the death and destruction fire can cause by getting in touch with their local fire & rescue service requesting a home safety check.”\nMark Cashin, Deputy Chief Fire Officer of Cheshire and Chair of the Chief Fire Officers Association’s Home Safety Committee, said:\n“While death and injuries from fires have reduced considerably in recent years, the majority of victims continue to be those who are most vulnerable, often living in private rented accommodation.\n“This change would improve the safety of families and stop dozens of people from losing their lives to fire each year. The cost to landlords is small, with a ten year sealed alarm costing around £15.”",

The evidence from the chaotic negotiations suggests that the best option is the status quo.

That is the view of the Liberal Democrat group.\nFollowing the decision of the planning committee to refuse planning permission for a £500m waste incinerator at Javelin Park, Liberal Democrat leader Cllr. Jeremy Hilton has written to the chief executive of Gloucestershire County Council requesting work on the project to be halted.\nJeremy Hilton has also asked for confirmation on whether or not the contract between the county council and Urbaser Balfour Beatty has been signed.\nCllr. Jeremy Hilton said: “The planning committee has spoken; in my view the plan to build a mass burn incinerator at Javelin Park should be stopped until after the elections on May 2nd, when a new administration can give fresh instructions to council officers to progress alternative plans.\n“Mechanical Biological Treatment of our residual waste would be much cheaper and more environmentally friendly alternative than burning our waste.”\nIn a letter to the chief executive, Cllr. Hilton requested that no further work be done on the waste incinerator project until new administration was in place. He also asked the council to request UBB from not proceeding with a planning appeal.\nCllr. Simon Wheeler a member of the planning committee said: “The committee came to the only honest conclusion it could in the face of overwhelming argument by members of the public. As a councillor I represent first the wishes of the public.\n“The public have made it absolutely clear that they do not wish to have this monstrosity built at Javelin Park and as such, by the end of the debate, that was the only way I could vote. If only the cabinet of GCC could have taken that principle on board months ago we could have saved every one much pain anguish and tax payers money”\nEnds…\nJavelin Park planning application – reasons for refusal\nThe development conflicts with several development plan policies and whilst WCS14, Structure Plan Policy NHE1, and Stroud District Local Plan Policy NE10 recognise the potential for other public (including social, environmental, and economic) benefits to outweigh harm to the landscape, it is considered as a matter of planning judgement the identified harm is not outweighed by those considerations.\nThe form of the development will introduce a prominent building causing significant loss of the open character and the natural rural appearance to this part of the Severn Vale contrary to WCS Policy 14, WLP Policy 37, Stroud District Local Plan Policy NE10 and paragraph 109 of the NPPF in term of the effect on the intrinsic character of the countryside and Structure Plan Policies NHE1 and S6 (a).\nThe development is outside the Cotswold AONB and views from it including from the Cotswold Way would be generally against the backdrop of the Severn Vale which includes other building development. It is considered that there would be some visual impact which would affect the noted special qualities of the area. We agree with Natural England that significant adverse impacts of the proposal are not outweighed by other considerations. Therefore, as a matter of judgment it is considered that there would be significant harm to the overall setting of the AONB and long distance views. The proposed mitigation measures in the layout and design of the EfW do not overcome this harm contrary to Policy WCS14.\nThe development would lead to harm to the significance of designated heritage assets and that harm is not outweighed by the public benefits of the proposal contrary to Policy WCS16 and Paragraph 134 of the NPPF.\nNotwithstanding the proposed mitigation, the proposed development would have an overbearing effect on nearby residential properties adversely affecting amenity contrary to WLP Policy 37 and Stroud District Local Plan Policy GE1.",

Application reference 16/00968/FUL.\nThis controversial application raised many objections from local residents when it was originally deposited with the council in 2016.\nThe deadline for comments to the Planning Inspectorate from the public was the 9th of August this year. Jeremy Hilton’s letter is below.\nGloucester City Council has still to respond. Within a few weeks the council will take its response to the planning committee for approval, before it is sent to the Planning Inspectorate.\nJeremy Hilton’s Letter to Planning Inspectorate\nI write to ask you to dismiss the appeal by Redrow Homes related to the planning application for 89 houses on the former Civil Service Sports Club ground (Ref:16/00968/FUL).\nI am the local county and city councillor for Kingsholm & Wotton.\nOn the 19th of April 2017, I did write to the case officer at Gloucester City Council pointing out that the application was then seven months old and that it should be determined with a recommendation to refuse.\nThe council said they were giving more time to Redrow to resolve the issue about the loss of sports pitches. Redrow had not in April 2017 nor since provided evidence on how they would mitigate for the loss of the playing fields.\nThere is a shortage of rugby and football pitches in Gloucester. Spartans Ruby Club, which is based in Kingsholm, is looking for an additional pitch near to its club house, which is in neighbouring Sherborne Street.\nThe High School for Girls, which is in Denmark Road has also spoken to me about possible use of the sports field if it is saved from development.\nAll Redrow have done since acquiring the site in 2011 (for just £10,000) is shut the gates and demolish the club house etc, making the facilities unavailable for active sport that it had previously been used for.\nSimilarly, since acquiring the site Redrow have failed to properly discuss the future of the playing fields with the local community that is required in the Joint Core Strategy policy INF4. The lack of community engagement is lamentable.\nRedrow’s idea of consultation has been to lodge two full planning applications with the council, leaving no opportunity for the council or the community to hold discussions about how the site could be developed for some housing, but leaving the rest of the site available for sport and recreation.\nAs Keith Annis a senior manager at Redrow once told me they were playing for time. The question must be asked why has it taken them nearly two years from depositing the planning application to lodge an appeal?\nFor Redrow to appeal against non-determination is rather hypocritical, particularly to do this only a few weeks after lodging a new planning application for 100 dwellings on the same site (Ref 18/00306/FUL)\nFurther Comments\nA. Affordable housing:\nThe plan for affordable homes did not meet the council’s then standard, when the application was submitted, which was 40 %. The application lists 18 dwellings as intermediate housing, this is equates to 20% of the build.\nIt was impossible for the council to approve an application that did not meet this standard. Subsequently, the Joint Core Strategy has been adopted, where the new limit is set at 20%.\nB. Land Purchase:\nThe applicants purchased the sports ground from the Civil Service Sports Council Ltd for just £10,000 in 2011 (GR355501). The applicants should publicly declare the details of the uplift clause they have with Civil Service Sports Council Ltd.\nI believe it is this legal agreement that is responsible for the maximisation of housing on the site rather than what one would expect an open discussion with the council and community on a development brief that would benefit all.\nSome degree of housing whilst retaining the main sports field for sport and recreation, would benefit everyone.\nC. Alternative sport provision:\nIt may be that the land has not been used for sport for more than five years, but that is because of a deliberate policy by the landowners to close the ground for sporting activities.\nI concur with Sport England that the application should be refused.\nThe applicants have failed to identify alternative facilities that could accommodate sporting activities that previously took place on the Civil Service Sports ground.\nIn my opinion, alternative provision must be within the Kingsholm & Wotton ward.\nD. Joint Core Strategy INF3\nThe proposed development of 89 dwellings in my opinion is not consistent with JCS policy on green infrastructure. The former Civil Service Sport Ground provides a worthy green infrastructure asset that should be protected to help resolve the shortage of open space in Kingsholm and Wotton.\nI believe it is not beyond the wit of all parties to come up with a development solution that would provide much needed housing whilst retaining a large open space that could continue to be used for sport and recreation.\nHere is Policy INF3\n1. The green infrastructure network of local and strategic importance will be conserved and enhanced, in order to deliver a series of multifunctional, linked green corridors across the JCS area by:\ni. Improving the quantity and/or quality of assets;\nii. Improving linkages between assets in a manner appropriate to the scale of development, and\niii. Designing improvements in a way that supports the cohesive management of green\ninfrastructure;\n2. Development proposals should consider and contribute positively towards green infrastructure, including the wider landscape context and strategic corridors between major assets and populations. Where new residential development will create, or add to, a need for publicly accessible green space or outdoor space for sports and recreational on, this will be fully met in accordance with Policy INF4. Development at Strategic Alloca ons will be required to deliver connectivity through the site, linking urban areas with the wider rural hinterland\n3. Existing green infrastructure will be protected in a manner that reflects its contribution\nto ecosystem services (including biodiversity, landscape / townscape quality, the historic environment, public access, recreation and play) and the connectivity of the green infrastructure network. Development proposals that will have an impact on woodlands, hedges and trees will need to include a jus ca on for why this impact cannot be avoided and should incorporate measures acceptable to the Local Planning Authority to mi gate the loss. Mi ga on should be provided on-site or, where this is not possible, in the immediate environs of the site\n4. Where assets are created, retained or replaced within a scheme, they should be properly integrated into the design and contribute to local character and distinctiveness. Proposals should also make provisions for future maintenance of green infrastructure.\nE. Joint Core Strategy INF4\nAs I have previously mentioned the lack of serious community engagement by Redrow ahead of this planning application, about the future use of the site, is lamentable.\nRedrow have only showed plans that have proposed the complete building on the site, with the loss of the playing fields. They have never properly consulted anyone.\nI believe they failed to meet the requirement of Joint Core Strategy policy INF4 for social and community infrastructure\nHere is Policy INF4\n1. Proposals to develop land or buildings currently or previously in use as a community facility will demonstrate, including evidence of engagement with relevant local community groups and partner organisations, why the facility is no longer required and, as appropriate, how, when and where suitable local replacement facilities will be provided. Provision of replacement facilities will have regard to the locational and other relevant elements of this policy\n2. Where new residential development will create, or add to, a need for community facilities, it will be fully met as on-site provision and/or as a contribution to facilities or services o -site. New or refurbished provision will be of an appropriate type, standard and size. From an early stage, developers will be expected to engage with the relevant local authorities and infrastructure providers and, as appropriate, relevant local community groups where they exist, to ensure that new provision meets the needs of the community that it will serve and is t for purpose\n3. Social and community infrastructure should be centrally located to the population it serves and\nbe easily accessible on foot and by bicycle. It should be located so as to have the potential to be well-served by public transport. Developers should aim to provide flexible, multifunctional facilities within mixed-use developments, creating shared space which maximises benefits to the community and minimises land-take. In the case of open space, ‘easily accessible’ means it is located within reasonable walking distance of the development it serves. New facilities should be accessible to all members of the community, and be planned and phased in parallel with new development.\nF. Draft City Plan Policy SA06\nThe provision of 89 dwellings is in my opinion is overdevelopment of the site, which is in the heart of Kingsholm.\nCouncil policy as identified in the draft City Plan, which was approved by council in December 2016, recommends a maximum of twenty dwellings (SA06).\nThe proposal of 89 dwellings exceeds this policy by 445%, with the complete loss of the playing fields.\nA compromise of 40 dwellings, for example, on this site would mean that the former sports field could be brought back into use.\nG. Layout of the site:\nThe layout of the site does not follow the usual street pattern that is evident in Kingsholm. It is adjacent to both the Kingsholm and Denmark Road conservation areas.\nI am concerned that the narrow streets on estate may be become clogged up with motorists parking their cars on footpaths. This is a problem that will be exacerbated during times when there are rugby matches being played at the Kingsholm stadium.\nThe small public open space is set out to give the impression that it is an exclusive space just for the new residents of the estate. New public open space should laid out to be inclusive and available to all Kingsholm residents.\nH. Highway access:\nI am not convinced by the design of the access point onto Estcourt Road slip road.\nThe proposed access onto Denmark Road is unacceptable. It closes the slip road to Lansdown Road and removes much-needed parking spaces on Denmark Road.\nThe closure of the slip road will create more vehicle conflict at the other junction with Lansdown Road. This will be a particular problem when school coaches use this junction.\nThe closure of the slip road will also remove the u-turn provision it provides for the houses serviced off the dual carriageway section of Denmark Road on the south side.\nI. Public open space:\nKingsholm & Wotton has a low level of public open space as identified in the city council’s open spaces strategy. The council’s standard is 2.8ha per 1000\nBased on the new ward boundaries introduced at the 2016 election the ward has just 0.49ha per 1,000 population. Or 3.59ha for a population based on mid 2016 of 7,259 persons.\nAn opportunity is being missed in the proposed development to achieve a good increase in public open space provision in the ward by the wholesale development of the site, which was formerly used for sport and recreation.\nI would recommend that this appeal is dismissed.\nYou have covered many points within your letter, but what really rankles within the sports community in Gloucester is the destruction of the buildings for changing facilities a ploy designed to circumvent any sports use whatsover and what about the price, can you say if the sale was put out to tender\nThe land was sold by Civil Service Sports Council Ltd to Redrow Homes for £10,000 in 2011. There will be an uplift clause that means Redrow will have to pay CSSC additional funds if they get planning permission for housing. The sale by CSSC surprised everyone. The land was not owned by the city council\nHi,\nJust read this, as a new resident in Hinton Road, and am amazed at Redrow Homes approach; and certainly back all your comments.\nWhen is there another opportunity for people to get involved?\nNext step is the meeting of the city council’s planning committee that needs to determine its response that will then be part of the submissions that the planning inspectorate will hear. The planning inquiry will be heard next year. You can still write to the city council a raise your objections to both the 89 house and 100 house appplications, if you haven’t done so already.",

The Liberal Democrats issue their own ‘Statement of Principles’, on which support for a devolution package will only then be determined.\nThe Liberal Democrat agreed principles are as follows:\n1) Liberal Democrats believe that devolution needs to be created by locally led processes and are mindful that devolution as it currently stands to a model set out by Government is not real devolution at all.\n2) Liberal Democrats will only support devolution if Government is genuinely interested in giving power back to local communities, but not if the intention of Government is simply to pass cost-cutting measures onto local authorities under the façade of devolution.\n3) The new responsibilities handed down from Government to Gloucestershire must come with full powers to decide, manage and innovate at a local level.\n4) The Government must ensure that adequate funding is guaranteed now and in the future to support good quality services for residents of the county.\n5) The government must ensure that the new arrangements allow for additional funds to be raised locally or through other legitimate means to support enhanced service provision if that is decided by locally elected members.\n6) The governance arrangements must be cross-party and fully reflect the political proportionality that exists on the councils that make up the new governing board that will oversee the new devolved services.\n7) We will not support the establishment of a metro mayor. Governance of the new additional arrangements must not be handed over to a single person as we believe collective responsibility across all political parties, provides for better services.\n8) If we want democracy alongside devolution, then, we ultimately need a fairer voting system for local government in the form of STV.\nLeader of the Liberal Democrats, Cllr. Jeremy Hilton (LD: Kingsholm and Wotton) said:\n“We are very much in favour of devolving more powers and responsibilities to local areas, but the deal must be right and it must be in the interests of Gloucestershire as a whole.\n“Our ‘Statement of Principles’ are more than just a wish list they are key to us supporting the ‘We are Gloucestershire’ bid, which I believe is being signed and submitted today.\n“There are a number of factors to be considered and the last thing we should be doing is to look at devolution through rose-tinted spectacles. While devolution presents a number of exciting opportunities, it will not be easy to commit to achieving better outcomes at further reduced costs and this ought to be fully realised.\n“Gloucestershire County Council is in no overall control and it is therefore vital that not only public sector partners are consulted, but that all political parties who are a part of the public sector have a say in what is being proposed and what will eventually be agreed.\n“In any deal, the question is: who holds the cards? It is important that through the negotiation process of devolution we don’t allow Government to hold all the cards.\n“I believe our ‘Statement of Principles’ goes some way to making sure that when we are in a position to agree a deal it will ultimately be the right one for Gloucestershire.”\nENDS\nNotes:\n1. Ten of Gloucestershire’s public sector partners have already come together including Gloucestershire Councils, the Police & Crime Commissioner, GFirst Local Enterprise Partnership and Gloucestershire Clinical Commissioning Group to have one conversation with Government about how, through devolution, one can achieve better outcomes and reduced costs.",

This may or may not be the case. We know that Aviva has been talking to a number of buyers.\nBut a sale isn’t a sale until it’s been signed on the dotted line.\nSecondly any purchaser, would want to talk to the city council ahead of the deal being completed. A sale therefore, may be subject to planning permission.\nThis morning, I have asked officers at the city council for an update. This is what I was told:\n“We have not had any confirmation from the owners or any prospective purchasers that the building has been sold and therefore it would be wrong to speculate on what the terms of any hypothetical disposal may be.”\nAs I have said before, my preference is to see the building restored to its former glory and repurposed if necessary.\nAs a regular shopper at this store I am also disappointed to see Debenhams go into liquidation.\nDebenhams building is not listed, though it sits in a conservation area so cannot be demolished without the council’s permission.\nWhat I do not want to see is this landmark building demolished to make way for a new build.\nThe Lib Dem group are determined to work with the new owners to see this handsome building fully restored and fully occupied. It’s a focal point in our city centre. An important anchor for our new Kings Square.",

All members of the council are united in their support of the county council remaining the local fire authority.\nAfter spending £100,000 of taxpayers money on employing his own consultants to mount a hostile bid to run the fire and rescue service, Mr Surl dropped his plan during the summer. The cost to the county council in defending its fire authority role was £35,000.\nLiberal Democrat Spokesperson for the Fire Service, Cllr. Jeremy Hilton (Kingsholm and Wotton) said:\n“The county council is the fire authority and already does a brilliant job in managing Gloucestershire Fire and Rescue Service. We all need to remember the great job our firefighters did during the 2007 floods.\n“I am very disappointed in the police and crime commissioner for wasting such a large sum of public money on empire building. In particular, I am concerned about the £10,000 cost of fire officer time spent on answering Mr Surl’s consultant’s questions. He needs to concentrate on delivering a better police service in Gloucestershire.\n“I am, however, pleased that he dropped his takeover bid.\n“The £135,000 of taxpayers money spent would have been better used on developing new collaborative projects between the blue light services. We should be looking at sharing our fire stations.\n“Together we pioneered the TriService emergency centre and vehicle workshops. The fire service is now helping the ambulance service by co-responding to medical emergencies and also helping social services with the enhanced self and well checks at people’s homes.\n“We can do more collaborative work something which I will be proposing at December’s Council meeting in Shire Hall.”",

It is expected that this will start on 1st of April. We have been assured that Kingsholm will be considered early in the review.\nThe county council will consider the current parking zone areas to see if amendments are required.\nThe following streets will also be considered as potential areas to be included in the residents parking permits scheme.\nArea 1 – North end of Deans Way, Sandhurst Road, Edwy Parade, & Kingsholm Square\nArea 2 – Hinton Road, Malvern Road, North Road & Seabroke Road\nArea 3 – Sebert Street, Oxford Road, Henry Road, Henry Street & Honyatt Road – plus parts of Heathville Road and Denmark Road.\nJeremy Hilton said: “Both Isabel Brazil and I have received a number of requests for residents parking zones to be introduced in Kingsholm. I am disappointed that a review should take place at same time as the permit fees are due to go up. However, there is serious commuter congestion in some streets that can only be resolved with a residents’ permit scheme.”\nIsabel Brazil said: “Changes to the permit zones will only go ahead if supported by a majority of residents living in the area. The county council will fully consult.”\nI have lived in Oxford Road for over 30 years and I will NOT be paying for the privilege of parking in my own road!\nYes, it is difficult to park outside my house and it doesn’t happen very often, but as long as I can park somewhere else in the road then I’m not bothered.\nHeather thanks for your comments. Last time residents parking was considered the residents of Oxford Road voted no. However, since then some have asked for residents parking to be introduced. The consultation will determine whether parking scheme is introduced or not.\nYour not prepared to pay 5 pound a month to park in your own road?. I live in swan road and it’s worth every penny. Think about it instead of being a tight arse. Your clearly begging for permits to happen.\nI am heavily in favour of expanding the residents parking permit zone to include more of Kingsholm. Parking has become a nightmare in recent years & the commuters who use our streets for parking show know regard for the people that live there.\nWe live on Honyatt Road, have a garage & driveway, but accessing them can often be difficult due to non residents inconsiderate parking!\nSimon thanks for your comments I will forward them on to the traffic regulation officer.\nHello\nAre you able to say which sections of Denmark Road & Heathville Road will be permit zones\nThank you\nAnne Cook\nCurrently it is just the areas marked on the map. Residents parking is being suggested where most houses don’t have off street parking. Time limited parking could be considered in other streets. But, this will cause a problem for your visitors. The consultation still has to start. I will forwarded your comments to the traffic regulations officer.\nThis does not seem to include Lansdown Road – where all the other cars will go if there is resident permit parking on the side roads. Where does that leave residents of Lansdown Road? With nowhere to park? How do they get included in this review?\nAnd what if your house is on a corner of two roads, one with restrictions and one without?\nI don’t see how you can cut an area up like this, and expect it to suit everyone. It should be either all or nothing.\nI have great sympathy for Kingsholm residents who have rugby, commuter, university student, hospital and school attendees all parking in the area. It is notable how quiet the streets are during the summer and Christmas holidays.\nThe zones for consideration are the ones provided by the county council. The basically include areas where most houses do not have off street parking. I will forwarded your comments about Lansdown Road. Problem here is that every house has off street parking.\nWhen will we find out the result of the consultation and will we have opportunity to give our opinions on this as residents? Seems unfair to punish the residents purely because commuters and hospital workers are too tight to pay for their own parking.\nThe consultation hasn’t begun. I’m waiting for this to be announced. Some residents are asking for scheme to be introduced, just so they can park near their homes. It not about punishing anyone, but about better management of on-street parking. Without it commuters can clog up the streets all day long.\nWe live in Deans Way and are keen to be involved in the process and would welcome residents parking permits. We have lived here for 25 years and the parking has never been so bad as it is now, we quite often can’t park in our street let alone near our house.\nWe are very much in favour of residents parking permits and happy to pay the fee.\nThe review of residents parking will start in October and take a year to complete.\nWill the consultation bear in mind the fact that a large number of residents on Oxford Rd are students and will therefore vote against? I wouldn’t want the vote swayed by a vast majority who only reside here for a certain number of weeks per year and have a large number of cars between them!\nI live in Alexandra Road and have Elizabeth House, Alexander House, Cherry Tree Lodge plus two more additional care facilities within close proximity of one another down our street. All of their staff and the staff at Gloucestershire hospital use our street as a glorified NCP car park. Parking is awful. I’m registered disabled and have made an application for a disabled bay but because I can’t even park in our street, let alone outside my property the line painters can’t come and put the marking’s on the road.\nI’m all for permit holders only. It’s just a shame that as residents we have to foot the financial shortfall because other people are inconsiderate and abuse the system.\nHello we live up Henry street ….the parking is bad …. 4hrs for anybody to park who don’t love up there I think it should be just 2 hours\nIt’s 2 hours for non permit holders in Henry Street",

The purpose of our motion is to put together tougher project management behind the list, with an action plan for every site on it, so that we can all scrutinise progress.\n“It is all too easy to forget the hard to do sites, whilst concentrating on the easy wins.\n“There are sites on the list where the Liberal Democrat group feel too little progress is being made and we want the cabinet member to focus some attention on them.\n“We need to remember that the restoration and regeneration of the Fleece Hotel has been set back by the recent fire. We have seen fires in other listed buildings in the past where they are left to rot for too long.”\nCouncillor Hilton, who represents Kingsholm, said that in his ward the former Trident Life office on London Road has been empty for years.\n“I understand that the owners have previously received a number of offers to buy it, but none have proceeded to a sale,” he said.\n“It is slowly deteriorating and has recently been boarded up. I would like to see the council use compulsory purchase powers to acquire it for residential purposes.”\nLib Dem finance spokesman Councillor Declan Wilson, who represents Hucclecote, added: “Returning these buildings to commercial use would bring much-needed revenue into Gloucester, including rents and business rates.\n“It would also help improve the range of businesses and services on offer to local residents and would also clear up what have become several unattractive grot spots and targets for anti-social behaviour in the centre of Gloucester.”\nThe motion, proposed by Councillor Hilton and seconded by Councillor Wilson, says: “This council agrees that one of its key objectives should be to oversee the regeneration of vacant and derelict sites within the council’s administrative area.\n“Council notes that it has a list of 38 regeneration sites on its ‘regeneration hit list’.\n“Council calls on the cabinet member for regeneration to prepare a report to refresh the hit list.\n“The cabinet member should seek advice from councillors on which sites should be included in the new regeneration hit list.\n“Finally, council requests that the new regeneration hit list include a cabinet approved action plan for each site, which can be monitored using the traffic light system.”",

Public services in our county could be severely damaged. One example would be Gloucestershire Fire and Rescue Service, which could be carved up by this plan.\n“It is amazing to think that Lynden Stowe, the leader of Cotswold District, who is also a county councillor, could ambush his leader, Mark Hawthorne in such a way.

Tenders have been delayed by the city council’s legal services team.\nCurrently, the garden is closed because it has become a location of problem street drinking. Adults have been drinking alcohol to excess, fighting and arguing between themselves, and using local residents’ front gardens as a toilet. The new garden layout has been designed to be more attractive and to discourage street drinking.\nCllr. Jeremy Hilton (Lib Dem – Kingsholm & Wotton) said: “The delay in construction of the new garden is disappointing, but this is becoming normal with projects run by Gloucester City Council. With so many jobs lost under the Tories’ austerity plan, there are not enough staff to process projects on time. This really is a ‘Vanishing Council’.\n“Isabel Brazil and I have worked hard to get an agreement for improvements to this problem garden. We secured funding to enable works to be done, but to be told last week that it is being delayed by the legal services team, is ridiculous.

It would be disrespectful to the Queen to seek royal status just as a marketing ploy,” said Councillor Hilton.\n“Tourists flock to Gloucester for the cathedral, the docks and 2,000 years of history. Putting ‘royal’ in the title is not going to make a jot of difference to that.\n“Instead of wasting his time renaming Gloucester Paul James should focus on regenerating the city centre.\n“Kings Square is a mess, too many shops lay empty and the subway under the railway station is an absolute disgrace. The city is covered in litter and we have no decent public toilets.\n“Sorting these problems out will bring more tourists to Gloucester and give local people a city to be proud of, not creating a cynical PR marketing campaign.”\nGloucester has a rich royal heritage – Edward II is entombed in the cathedral and Henry III was crowned King in 1216.\n“But Gloucester’s most recent royal connection was in 1643 during the Siege of Gloucester when the forces of King Charles I lay siege to the city,” said Councillor Hilton.\n“The Parliamentary forces successfully withheld the King’s onslaught to prevent Gloucester from falling. Fifty people lost their lives or were wounded defending the parliamentary cause from 10 August and 5 September 1643.

There were just 139 scheduled inspections in the last financial year compared to 366 in 2010/11. This is a worrying trend.

This time the Tory run council plans to axe a further 60 jobs. At this rate, the council will cease to exist in future – its vanishing before us. The council is already running a skeleton service compared to eight years ago.\nIn 2009 the council employed 432 members of staff providing much needed service to the people of Gloucester. With this round of job losses, the number employed will be just 187.\nAlready services are suffering with projects being delayed or not done at all. The delayed work on the bus station and failure to deliver the Kings Quarter project are two high profile examples of projects suffering from overburdened staff.\nThe annual hours lost from the proposed job cuts will be 102,000 per year. The total loss of annual hours will be 417,000 compared to 2009. You can imagine a lot of additional work could be done if we reinstated the lost hours.\nThe council’s project to cut these 60 jobs is called ‘Together Gloucester’. A more appropriate name might have been ‘Goodbye Gloucester’. Certainly, many loyal members of staff will be reluctantly saying goodbye to the council fairly soon.\nTo cut these jobs, there will be major restructuring of the council and staff will have to apply for new generic jobs where they will have to double up on their responsibilities. Specialist technical work could be carried out by less experienced staff. Everyone will become a ‘jack of all trades’.\nLiberal Democrats are concerned about the council’s ability to run important services in future.

This is totally unfair, but our Tory council just take the grant cuts on the chin and we all suffer and good staff become unemployed.\nI believe the leader of the council needs to get on the train to London and lobby hard for a better funding deal for Gloucester City Council. He hasn’t in the past. Is it because he is too timid to fight for Gloucester?\nThe cuts must stop.

The council would buy back the ownership of Llanthony Secunda Priory for just one pound. This is a better solution than handing the priory over to the Official Receiver should the Llanthony Secunda Priory Trust become insolvent.”\nA successful trust today is not necessarily a successful trust tomorrow.

The call-in is supported by members of the council who have acknowledged their support for this particular call-in via email.\nThe decision of cabinet was as follows:\n- That the restrictive covenants be removed in accordance with the request from LSPT.\n- That Planning Committee be requested to vary the S106 agreement relating to the property.\n- That the above are subject to agreeing a provision for continuing public access to the property and that the City Council shall have the continued right to nominate a Trustee.\nAhead of the cabinet decision Cllr.

This was mitigated by the covenant relating to the transfer of the land back to the council should the management trust fail.\n- The decision to go ahead with the trust was done on the understanding that this safeguard would remain.\n- A successful trust today is not necessarily a successful trust tomorrow.\n- To remove the covenant now would not therefore be in the best interests of the city as it could potentially put the future of one of Gloucester’s most important historical assets at risk.\nThe signatories to the call-in request that the decision of cabinet is reviewed in particular the resolution to remove the covenants that this council holds on Llanthony Secunda Priory.”",

Firstly, in December 2011, the Liberal Democrats lodged what is known as a ‘call-in’ over the selection of a preferred bidder and again another ‘call-in’ was submitted in September 2012 over the Cabinet’s decision to award the contract to Urbaser Balfour Beatty (UBB) before the Council’s planning committee had considered the incinerator application.\nLeader of the Liberal Democrats, Cllr. Jeremy Hilton (LD: Kingsholm and Wotton) who will be leading calls for the review said:\n“From the beginning, we’ve always challenged the process. In making a decision to cancel the incinerator contract at this stage, one needs to be sure of the exact costs involved and whether or not the contract had the necessary break-clauses in place to minimise any potential financial risk to this council.\n“I am not convinced that the £60m-£100m cost to cancel the UBB contract is accurate, but has been instead overly estimated as a scaremongering tactic to stop elected members from voting in favour of cancelling the contract for fear of reprisals to council services.\n“It is only right and responsible for an independent auditor to examine the contract in detail and determine impartially the actual figures involved with cancelling a contract of this nature and at this particular stage.\n“If the figures are proved to be accurate, then, the Tories should be ashamed of themselves in purposefully tying our hands to a stringent and highly inflexible contract that will cost many millions of taxpayers’ money to cancel and detrimentally affect many council services.\n“Until we know fully the costs involved, then, I do not feel that any elected member on Wednesday can make an informed decision over whether or not to cancel the incinerator contract.\n“Labour has been overzealous in calling for the cancellation of the incinerator without first looking at all the costs involved and are playing politics over an important issue, which is simply for the benefit of their parliamentary candidate standing in Stroud. If sensible they too would be asking for such a review.\n“It is time that we stop playing politics with such an important issue and get to the bottom of the real costs involved and whether the process was done correctly from the beginning.”\nDeputy Leader of the Liberal Democrats, Cllr. Iain Dobie (LD: Leckhampton and Warden Hill) also said:\n“If Labour are serious about cancelling this contract then wouldn’t it be better for them to know all the facts and surely if the Tories have nothing to hide then delaying work until the contract has been independently scrutinised would give elected members and residents of Gloucestershire confidence in the current administration.\n“A review of this kind would give elected members like myself who were only elected in 2013 all the facts to make a reasoned and informed decision on whether it really is in the best interests of Gloucestershire to cancel the incinerator contract or not. I believe in transparency and I come to this without any prejudice.\n“Our request is basically that once this review has been completed and a full uncensored report be presented to full council on Wednesday 20th May, then, we shall be in a much better position to make such an important decision.”",

Please sign it at:-\nhttps://gloucester-libdems.org.uk/en/petition/save-our-sainsbury-s\nJeremy’s letter to Simon Roberts\nDear Mr Roberts\nI was shocked to learn this week that your company is to close its supermarket at Northgate Street, Gloucester after nearly 50 years of successful trading. Many people that I represent, who live in Kingsholm are very unhappy about the store’s closure as they use it regularly.\nMy Lib Dem colleague, Dr Rebecca Trimnell, who is campaigning for the residents of the city centre has raised an online petition to save the supermarket. The returns are good.\nI remember the store when it first opened as I had a Saturday job there as a teenager. I still shop in the store more than three times a week. Not only do residents of Kingsholm and city centre use it, but those working in the centre or other residents in Gloucester who are shopping in the city centre also pickup provisions before they go home.\nI imagine the store isn’t the strongest trading store, but it must still be profitable as the investment in the building will have been paid off long ago. I have noticed you have been running down the variety of stock, which may have hit trade a bit, but it’s Covid-19 pandemic that has had a major impact.\nHowever, trade is recoverable as we get through this pandemic. The city council is just about to invest in the refurbishment of Kings Square, which along with the regeneration around the bus and railway stations will bring in more people to the city centre. This will lead to an increase in footfall.\nIt would be so sad not to have a Sainsbury’s in the city centre while Tesco, Iceland and M&S will have a presence, but none of them can offer the same service and stock range that you can continue to do from Northgate Street.\nBoth Dr Rebecca Trimnell and I would appreciate meeting a senior representative of your company to discuss how we could keep the store open to mutual benefit.\nFinally, the city council will discuss a motion in my name about saving the store on the 24th of September.\nYours sincerely,\nCity Cllr.

Lib Dems have described the ‘garden waste tax’ as ‘daylight robbery’. They blame the Conservative council and government in equal proportion.\nThe current charge for garden waste collection is £36 per year. The charge was introduced in 2011 to cover the cost of collection on this non-statutory service. Lib Dems discovered in 2016 that the council was profiteering from the collection by around £6 per bin, making a profit of £110,000 a year. The Tories now propose to increase the charge to £44.\nLib Dem leader, Jeremy Hilton said: “Last year we tried to reduce the charge to £31 to just cover the cost of collection. Both Labour and Tory councillors rejected our proposal. Now the Conservatives plan to increase the charge to £44. This is a tax on responsible householders who recycle their garden waste. It’s daylight robbery.”\nLib Dem Deputy leader, Declan Wilson said: “The council’s finances are dire and the Tories are penalising responsible householders. We should be encouraging recycling not taxing it. The Tories will be making a profit of £13 on every green bin. This a profit margin of 30%.

It’s unfair.”\nLiberal Democrats call for more investment in Gloucester’s footways\nGloucester City Council on the 1st of December will debate the state of the city’s footways and the amount of money the Conservative led county council spends annually on resurfacing. The motion proposed by the Liberal Democrat group will call on the county council (the highway authority) to increase its capital footway budget from the £83,000 being spent this year.\nLiberal Democrat leader, Cllr. Jeremy Hilton said:\n“The state of many of the footways in Gloucester is shocking, in particular on our post-war housing estates and the older parts of the city. These footpaths are decades old and they need resurfacing rather than patching. The funds allocated by the Conservative run county council on resurfacing are inadequate. The county council must increase spending on footway repairs next year and beyond.”\nLiberal Democrats have been critical about the Tories who have recently agreed to spend a £1m on new telephones for Shire Hall and have given contractors UBB £30m in a cash gift to build the waste incinerator at Javelin Park. Money the Lib Dems say could have been better spend on repairing our roads and footpaths.\nCllr. Emily Ryall who will second the motion said:\n“It is unacceptable that the Conservative run county council do not see it as a priority to spend taxpayers’ money on ensuring that our pavements and footpaths are safe and fit for purpose.

These residents deserve better.”\nEnds….\nMotion – poor maintenance of footways in Gloucester\n“This council expresses its deep concern about the state of many of the footways in Gloucester, noting that the county council has only budgeted to spend £83,000 from its capital budget on footways repairs within the city council boundaries this financial year.\nThis council notes that there are many footpaths, particularly on post-war housing estates, that are in desperate need of resurfacing.\nThis council therefore calls on Gloucestershire County Council to increase its capital spending on footway repairs within Gloucester for the 2017/18 council year and beyond.”\nProposed by Jeremy Hilton\nSeconded by Emily Ryall\nLiberals choose Linda Castle for the Longlevens By-election\nLocal resident Linda Castle has been selected by the Liberal Democrats to be its candidate in the Longlevens by-election.\nLinda has lived in Longlevens almost her whole life.\nThe married mother of two, who works as an IT trainer for the NHS, grew up in Longlevens, went to Longlevens infant, junior and secondary schools and raised her family in Longlevens.\nThe Longlevens by-election will be held on Thursday November 3 following the death of Conservative city councillor Jim Porter in August.\nLinda said: “I am so proud to be standing for election to represent Longlevens – the area where I grew up.\n“I know the area well and I am determined to speak up for Longlevens residents at the city council.\n“I am campaigning for improvements to our roads and pavements in Longlevens, which are in a mess due to inaction by the Conservatives at Shire Hall.\n“I am determined to make sure the proposals by the Boundary Commission to put Longlevens back into Gloucester are adopted.\n“I am also fighting to ensure that residents in Longlevens do not suffer from the effects of thousands of new homes being built on the outskirts of Gloucester, such as pressure on the local road network, doctors’ surgeries and schools.”\nAfter leaving school Linda worked for the CEGB in finance before joining the NHS.\nIn recent years Linda has been involved in the community campaign over the expansion of the Oxstalls campus and also wants to see the former Bishop’s College site retained for educational use.\nLinda was also treasurer of the Gloucester Dyslexia Association for four years.

The Liberal Democrat group will propose the motion.\nFrom 10th August to 5th September 1643 the army of King Charles I besieged Gloucester. The city held out for just short of a month under the leadership of Colonel Massie until it was relieved by parliamentary troops under the command of the Earl of Essex. This was a pivotal turning point in the civil war.\nCllr. Jeremy Hilton who is to propose the motion said: “The revival of Gloucester Day and the parade is one way in which the city remembers the events of 1643 when our ancestors fought on the side of parliament. It was a crucial turning point in the English Civil War. We should be proud of this point in our history. Gloucester fought for parliament and democracy. That is why I am proposing that we set up a cross party working group to see how we can better remember and commemorate the Siege of Gloucester. We should consult the public as well.”\nThe seconder of the motion Cllr Joanne Brown said: “I well remember taking part in the first Gloucester Day parade of the modern era in 2009 and how it brought home to me the great spirit and strong will of the people of Gloucester who stood together during the siege of 1643. Today we can feel proud of the pivotal role our city played in changing the course of the Civil War and I believe that we can do even more to remember and commemorate the events of the siege.”\nEnds….\nText of the notice of motion\n“This council notes that Gloucester Day is a recently reinstated annual day of celebration of the city’s history and culture.\nGloucester Day was first held in the modern era on 5th September 2009, but originally dates from the lifting of the Siege of Gloucester in 1643, during which the city held out against royalist forces during the First English Civil War. The lifting of the siege was celebrated annually in the city for years afterwards but died out in the nineteenth century.\nThis council thanks the organisers of this year’s Gloucester Day celebrations and wishes them well in planning the 2017 celebrations.\nThis council also remembers the sacrifice and determination of the people of Gloucester as they defended the parliamentary garrison (10th August to 5th September 1643) against the besieging army of King Charles I. The siege ended with the arrival of a relieving parliamentary army under the Earl of Essex.\nThis council recognises that the Siege of Gloucester is one of the most important events in the history of this city of which we should all be proud and that we agree to set up a cross party working group to consider what else we can do to remember and commemorate the events of 1643.”\nProposed by Jeremy Hilton\nSeconded by Joanne Brown\nLonglevens set to return to Gloucester\nLonglevens will be represented by Gloucester’s MP if proposals by the Boundary Commission are approved.\nThe Liberal Democrats launched a petition earlier this year to show the strength of feeling that Longlevens should be represented by Gloucester’s MP rather than Tewkesbury’s.\nA couple of hundred local people signed the petition – both online and in the Lib Dem Spotlight newsletters – saying identified more with Gloucester than Tewkesbury.\nAmong the comments posted by people signing the petition on the change.org website, include: “This ludicrous situation has to change. Longlevens is part and parcel of GLOUCESTER, not Tewkesbury.”\nAnother said: “I live within the City of Gloucester and wish to be represented by the City MP. It makes no sense to be represented by a town MP 12 miles away.”\nToday the Boundary Commission, the independent agency that reviews Parliamentary boundaries, published its draft proposals to cut the number of MPs in England by 32 to 501.\nIn Gloucester, the Boundary Commission has proposed putting Longlevens back into Gloucester and moving the Quedgeley Fieldcourt and Quedgeley Severn Vale wards into the Stroud constituency.\nCouncillor Jeremy Hilton, the leader of Gloucester Liberal Democrat leader, said: “I am really pleased that the Boundary Commission is proposing to move Longlevens back into Gloucester.\n“Residents in Longlevens identify with Gloucester, so it is only right that local people are represented by the city’s MP.\n“I am also pleased the Boundary Commission has not resurrected previous plans to move the heart of Gloucester, including the cathedral and city centre, into the Forest of Dean.”\nMr Hilton said earlier this year the Conservatives had appeared lukewarm to his suggestion and comments about the Boundary Commission’s proposals supported that view.\n“In the summer Tewkesbury MP Laurence Robertson was against moving Longlevens back to Gloucester and Richard Graham was not bothered about reclaiming Longlevens,” he said.\n“The Liberal Democrats plan to make submissions to the Boundary Commission to ensure its initial proposals to include Longlevens are adopted. However, we will look closely at the south of the city and see if we can propose a solution that retains Quedgeley as well.”\nGloucester Lib Dems call for new ‘City Plan’ for Gloucester\nGloucester City Council is to debate a motion from the Liberal Democrat group, at council on Thursday. The Lib Dems are calling for a new City Plan for Gloucester, which will be an up to date set of polices that will become the development framework for Gloucester for the next few years.\nLib Dem leader, Cllr. Jeremy Hilton (Kingsholm & Wotton) said: “The last adopted development plan dates back to 1983. Its 33 years old and a lot has changed in Gloucester since then. Both Labour and Conservative administrations, in that time, have failed to get updates to the plan adopted as required by the government. We are asking the cabinet member for housing & planning to report back to council in September on how he intends to deliver a new City Plan. We want it adopted as a matter of urgency.”\nThe current timetable for approving the new City Plan was for it to be approved by council in time to go to the planning inspector in the winter of 2016 for adoption in 2017. Liberal Democrats are concerned that the delays in approving a new City Plan could allow a developers to override current polices arguing they are out of date, despite many being formally being ‘saved’ by the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government in 2007.\nCllr. David Brown (Hucclecote), Lib Dem spokesperson for housing & planning said: “The city council have a timetable to deliver the City Plan but due to the delay in adopting the Joint Core Strategy (JCS) it is now woefully outdated. We need the council to be able to work with developers from a position of strength, with a clear plan for the city, a plan that best benefits current and future residents. For that we need a City Plan that is fit for the future sooner rather than later.”\nThe new City Plan should be a development document that sits beneath the JCS. It must explain how the council will implement the spatial vision and strategic objectives in the JCS up to the year 2031 and provide criteria that it will apply when considering planning applications for different types of buildings or other development.\nWe should vote to remain- by Jeremy Hilton\nForty-one years ago I voted yes to stay in the Common Market. I intend to vote yes again on Thursday with a positive vote to REMAIN in the European Union. A union of 28 countries working together peacefully to sort out issues of cross border importance, such as trade, the environment and security.\nMy primary reason in voting yes in 1975 was to make sure that European countries sorted out their differences around a table and not on a battlefield. I wanted to live my life in peace. I have never regretted my decision. I have seen the Common Market of nine countries grow into the European Union of twenty-eight.\nIn 1975 the continent was split between western democracies and socialist dictatorships. Spain, Greece & Portugal were becoming democracies and joined the EU in the early 1980s. Now the EU has a population of 508 million living in peace with each other and with governments co-operating over issues that affect us all. As Winston Churchill said “Jaw Jaw is better than War War”.\nI have been concerned about the whole tone of the referendum campaign, particularly when I listen to those arguing to leave. I also think to myself; ‘I want my country back’. But, what I certainly don’t want is the UK run by a right wing clique of people who feed on people’s fears and concerns. Who stir up xenophobia and blame others for our problems.\nI grew up in a country that was proud of itself and was an open and free society, working with other nations within international organisations such as the UN, NATO, the Commonwealth and the EU. I believe that if we leave the EU it will be a step backwards. We could see our country fall apart with Scotland leaving the UK and “Little England” left just floating in the mid-Atlantic with few friends.\nAs individuals we would lose our right to live and work anywhere in the EU. Our European Health Insurance Card will become invalid. Many of us will suffer from loss of work or earnings. Taxes may rise. We shall probably experience years of regret that we isolated ourselves from our friends on the continent.\nI also want to address the nonsense espoused by leave campaigners that the EU is undemocratic, this is untrue. Every five years we elect MEP’s to represent us in the European Parliament, which amends and approves legalisation that the Council of Ministers’ support. The Council of Ministers includes an elected representative from every government. The European Commission acts in a similar way to our very own Civil Service.\nI hope that everyone will think very carefully about the way they are going to vote on Thursday. This is not the time to bash the Tory government, we can do that at the ballot box at the next general election. This is a time to vote for our children’s future. In my view it will be much better for them if we remain in the EU.\nRUSSIAN ROULETTE’ TUMBLE DRYERS NEED RECALLING, URGE FIRE AUTHORITIES\nDangerous tumble dryers prone to exploding into flames need recalling urgently to avoid people “playing Russian roulette” as new figures reveal firefighters are attending three fires a day caused by the appliances.\nThe Local Government Association (LGA), which represents 48 fire and rescue authorities in England and Wales, is calling on leading manufacturers to recall faulty tumble dryers which have been linked to thousands of fires caused by excess fluff contacting heating elements.\nGovernment statistics show there were 2,190 tumble dryer fires between 2012 and 2014 – equating to three a day.\nHomes have been ruined and in some cases, the machines have burst into flames as people loaded them with clothes. An inquest has opened into the deaths of two men who died after a tumble dryer caught fire.\nThe LGA is warning that companies who are running lengthy repair programmes for potentially dangerous machines, instead of recalling them, are risking the lives of millions of customers.\nIt is calling on manufacturers to recall affected tumble driers and for all white goods to have fire-proof markings on them, including the manufacturer, model and serial number, so they can be identified more easily if they are damaged after causing a fire.\nCllr Jeremy Hilton, Chair of the LGA’s Fire Services Management Committee, said:\n“People using faulty tumble dryers are unwittingly playing Russian roulette and leading manufacturers need to recall affected models as soon as possible to protect their customers.\n“Firefighters are attending tumble dryer fires three times a day, which is alarming. These defective products are endangering lives, causing thousands of pounds of damage to homes and making people homeless.\n“People’s safety must be the priority. It’s been months since some manufacturers issued safety warnings over their tumble dryers but they need to be recalled as these appliances are still causing fires – until they do so, consumers continue to risk falling victim to a devastating and tragic house fire.\n“Fire-proof markings on all white goods would also help improve manufacturing and safety standards by helping fire investigators identify the make and model of any appliance damaged after causing a fire.\n“Users must take simple precautions using tumble dryers. The compartment where fibres from fabric build up should be cleaned out after every load of clothes is dried, to reduce the risk of it igniting, and the vent or any other opening should not be covered.\n“People should never leave tumble driers on overnight or when they go out. Anyone buying an electrical item should complete the guarantee registration to ensure goods which do not meet safety specifications are repaired, replaced or refunded. This also enables manufacturers to contact owners in the event of a product recall.\n“People also need to ensure they have a working smoke alarm – which can be a life-saver – in the event something does go wrong and test them regularly, ideally once a week.”\nAnyone with concerns about the safety of electrical appliances can report them to the Citizens Advice consumer helpline on 03454 04 05 06.\nLiberal Democrats on city council announce spokespersons\nThe seven Liberal Democrats councillors on Gloucester City Council met at the weekend to elect their leader and deputy leader, plus other group positions.\nCllr.

Currently the city council is controlled by the Conservatives, but the Liberal Democrats believe that the council could be run much better.\nLiberal Democrat leader, Cllr. Jeremy Hilton said: ”Services are not improving, budgets are being cut and we have had the first council tax rise in five years. The Tories are taxing responsible householders who recycle their garden waste by overcharging them for the garden waste collections. The Tory ‘Garden Tax’ adds £6 to the price of every green bin above what is needed to cover collection costs.\n“Regeneration in the city centre has stalled with the Kings Quarter project going nowhere. Its a shambles. The council administration needs to work much harder. We need to kick-start regeneration within the city centre. Kings Square has been unloved by the Conservatives and Labour for 25 years. We need to make this a great public space. We also need a new indoor market in a new location.\nThe last approved city plan for Gloucester dates back to the 1980s. We shall deliver a new city plan with policies to protect the environment, strengthen the economy and enhance the historic fabric of the city. We will do our best to encourage the building of more affordable homes to rent particularly within the social housing sector. We will also increase resources to defend council planning policies and decisions.”\n“There is so much to do and Liberal Democrats are up for the challenge.”\nA dozen ideas for a better city\n1. Market Parade or (White Friars) project\nWe will get this project started, which will include a new hotel, indoor market, city centre homes, car park and some retail. That is a true gateway into Gloucester, which is well linked to a refurbished railway station.\n2. Kings Square\nThis should be our premier open space in the city centre. It has been unloved by the council for 25 years. It must become a space for public events, dining and socialising, with (limited) new pavilion cafes, restaurants, and most of all, superb public art that pulls people to the square.\n3. Cathedral Quarter\nProject Pilgrim will help enhance the area around the cathedral, but we need to look at the whole of lower Westgate Street. How about refurbishing the small square outside Shire Hall or creating a visitors centre in Pitt Street, where the stone masons work keeping the cathedral in good condition?\n4. City Centre living\nWe must continue to support city centre living with new developments. The council must do more to encourage the conversion to housing of former office/commercial space within the city centre.\n5. City Centre environment\nThere are too many pound shops, turf accountants and tattoo parlours. We do need to improve our retail offer. There is no provision of high quality public toilets and this must be addressed. The pavements are littered with chewing gum and Liberal Democrats will invest in improving street cleaning in our city centre. The provision of public art in city centre is underwhelming.\n6. Regeneration Oversight\nRegeneration oversight is done behind closed doors and we propose to create a new Regeneration Scrutiny Committee to meet in public that can properly scrutinise the council’s regeneration plans. Lib Dems will bring Marketing Gloucester under tighter control by the city council.\n7. History\nWe live in a great historic city and we should promote this more effectively, with restoration of important buildings, festivals remembering our past & public art celebrating our 2,000 years of development. We would bring the new Culture Board under greater democratic control.\n8. University City\nWe must support the continued development of University of Gloucestershire in the city and encourage purpose built student accommodation in Blackfriars area to persuade year two and three students to stay in Gloucester rather than move to Cheltenham.\n9. Waste Collection\nLiberal Democrats will retain the current collection schedules and introduce recycling of cardboard and all plastics. We will scrap the Tories’ Garden Tax, placed on responsible householders who recycle their garden waste, by removing the surcharge for the collection of green wheelie bins.\n10. City Planning\nWe shall deliver a new city plan with policies to protect the environment, strengthen the economy and enhance the historic fabric of the city. We will do our best to encourage the building of more affordable homes to rent particularly within the social housing sector, despite the Tory government plans to ditch building new homes for rent. Lib Dems will invest extra resources in defending council planning polices and we will take necessary enforcement action against those who flout planning conditions.\n11. Homelessness\nWe shall focus on measures to reduce homelessness in the city. Working with partners, we will tackle drug and alcohol addiction, ensuring that homeless individuals with mental health issues get the support they deserve.\n12. Environment\nWe will crack down on dog fouling in parks, open spaces and on our streets. We will enhance our public parks and improve children’s play facilities. Liberal Democrats will remove the tacky advertising boards that the Tories installed that are now blighting our roundabouts.",

King’s Quarter has been delayed again and again. We will make sure that the city centre is not forgotten, and will press developers to deliver on time, with developments that local people actually want.\n2) Our idea to provide free wifi in Gloucester city centre is being implemented. We will make sure it is delivered in time for the Rugby World Cup. We will create a modern welcome for visitors to our historic city.\n3) Liberal Democrats in Gloucester are working to ensure there are clean, modern public conveniences in the city centre. The Tory administration’s Community Toilet scheme is a failure, and Gloucester deserves better.\n4) Gloucestershire Airport Ltd (GAL) is owned by the city council, jointly with Cheltenham Borough Council. We shall continue to support GAL as a general aviation airport to provide jobs and air transport services. We shall also deliver our plans to enhance the railway station and the building of a new central bus station.\n5) We will lobby the government to provide better infrastructure for Gloucester, from roads and public transport, to superfast broadband for all new developments.\n6) We have consistently opposed the massive waste incinerator planned for Javelin Park, Quedgeley. Local Tories on the county council rammed this plan through with the help of UKIP councillors, despite it being unanimously rejected by the planning committee. We will ensure that household waste that is collected by the city council is not burnt in an incinerator when it can be recycled.\n7) Gloucester Liberal Democrats will listen to the residents of Gloucester in making their budget decisions. In these challenging times, councils have to make tough choices and innovate to save money and create revenue. We will listen to all ideas for how best to do this.\n8) Gloucester Cathedral is a magnificent building at the heart of our city. It could be a World Heritage Site, which would make it even more of a tourist attraction. Liberal Democrats chair a group trying to make this happen.\n9) Gloucester has a rich heritage and cultural history. We currently do not have an Arts Council-supported venue in the city, and we would work to make that a reality. Gloucester should be a creative hub for artists, writers, musicians and performers. We will bring more Festivals and events to Gloucester, including a literary festival.\n10) Gloucester Liberal Democrats will ensure that the Rugby World Cup is a fantastic celebration enjoyed by all. The city must be spotlessly clean and there must be adequate facilities to accommodate all the extra fans. The council must work with England Rugby to ensure a lasting legacy from the World Cup.

The work will be led by the Environment Agency and cost £400,000. The start date is 2019.\nLiberal Democrat parliamentary candidate for Gloucester, Cllr. Jeremy Hilton said:\n“This investment is welcome news for a lot of residents in the county who know what it is like to have their property damaged by flood water. I hope these schemes will give some comfort and reassurance to residents whose homes are most at-risk.\n“Being prepared for future severe weather will undoubtedly bring a lot of security to those who every year face uncertainly over whether or not their home will be flooded.\n“I am particular pleased about the four schemes that are being funded to protect homes in Gloucester. At Alney Island 59 properties will receive added flood protection from the River Severn as the Environment Agency improves the flood protection to the island. This year the floodwaters came within a two inches of breaching the floodwall at Alney Terrace.\n“Three other schemes are being funded at The Rea in Hempsted, Deans Walk in Kingsholm and Tewkesbury Road at Longford. We have seen how the investment in flood protection following 2007 has worked. We must continue to invest in flood protection. I applaud the new money being provided by the coalition government in Gloucester and the rest of the county.”\nFour schemes in Gloucester are\n· Tewkesbury Road, Longford, Gloucester. Individual property level protection measures to reduce flood risk for up to 6 properties. Currently £30,000 has been allocated for measures to be implemented in 2018. . Scheme to be led by Gloucester City Council.\n· Deans Walk, Gloucester. Individual property level protection measures to reduce flood risk for up to 46 properties. Currently £230,000 has been allocated for measures to be implemented in 2020. Scheme to be led by Gloucester City Council.\n· River Severn, Hempsted and Rea, Gloucester. Currently local levy funding has been allocated to develop a scheme to improve the existing defences to reduce flood risk to 132 properties and businesses.

This is to be led by the Environment Agency.\n· Alney Island Improvements, River Severn. A project to improve the standard of protection offered by the existing defences at Alney Island, Gloucester to 59 properties. £400,000 has been provisionally allocated towards a scheme. As the options develop the scheme costs are likely to increase.

The Red Cross Fire Emergency Support Service provides invaluable support to Gloucestershire Fire and Rescue Service.\n6) A £10K pot of money to provide support in the form of courses for those approved adopters who adopt older children and teenagers where risk of disruption is recognised to be high. The aim is to further support these placements and reduce the chance of the placement breaking down.\n7) £50K one-off investment package into a number of Road Safety Programmes including a repeat of all Year 5 pupils at Gloucestershire’s primary schools being given the opportunity to have a session at Gloucester’s SkillZone.\n8) That a £20K one-off investment is given to the Child Sexual Exploitation (CSE) Team to work towards doubling the number of children who receive e-Safety in 2015/2016.\nLeader of the Liberal Democrats, Cllr. Jeremy Hilton (LD: Kingsholm and Wotton) said:\n“We are delighted in securing these proposals, which are now a part of the 2015/2016 budget.

Teachers have overwhelmingly reported that their children will be safer after a session.\n“I am also excited by the one-off investment that is to be given to the Red Cross Emergency Support Service. They play a pivotal role in providing the basic amenities and emotional support to those going through the horrific experience of an emergency situation such as a house fire, flood or even road traffic accident.\n“Users of our public libraries will be delighted that free WiFi will be available in all libraries.\n“I’m really looking forward to seeing how small pots of money can make a big difference in Gloucestershire.”\nDeputy Leader of the Liberal Democrats, Cllr. Iain Dobie (LD: Leckhampton and Warden Hill) also said: “We welcome the £100K investment to undertake the necessary feasibility and advance design work in preparation for delivering cycling schemes.\n“Cycling should be for everyone, not just the speedsters in Lycra.

However, there is still a lot of design work to do in making sure that the refurbished square is something we can all be proud of and enjoy.\nIt is critical that we get the layout of the development and the quality of the architecture right so that the development becomes an impressive gateway into the city centre from both the railway station and bus station. There will also be a new car park with 428 spaces and I hope the designers ensure that it will be a safe and pleasant place to use. The proposed hotel should also be of the quality that will boost Gloucester’s offer and attract people back to the city.\nKings Quarter should also be the location of a modern and good quality indoor market to replace the tired market at the Eastgate Shopping Centre. Markets need a good footfall and the development at Kings Quarter should provide a location near to the transport hubs for specialist market traders to thrive.\nIt will be important that the development is a high quality build and of a design that wins architectural awards. I believe the consultants have got it right in proposing four phases of the development. The inclusion of residential units in the plans must also be welcomed.\nFinally, I do think the city council cabinet has missed a golden opportunity to move its offices to the King’s Quarter. The cabinet is considering selling the offices at Herbert, Kimberly and Phillpotts warehouses and moving into Shire Hall.

This means there are 3.5 million smaller private rental homes which legally do not have to have them. The Government passed a law in 2013 which would require all private landlords to provide smoke alarms. However, this has gone out to consultation and has not yet been brought into force.\nFire and Rescue Authorities in England and Wales are calling for the law to be enacted so all private landlords are obliged to install them. They also want electrical wiring to be inspected annually – in the same way landlords are obliged to obtain gas safety certificates every year.\nThe call comes as latest figures show more than 200 people die in fires in their homes every year. (This figure covers both rental and owner occupier properties.) Householders are at least four times more likely to die in a fire if they do not have a working smoke alarm.\nFire and Rescue Authorities are taking a lead by giving out free alarms and launching safety awareness campaigns. However, given the tough austerity climate, they argue it must be down to private landlords to ensure alarms are installed.\nMandatory smoke alarms is set to be a key issue at the LGA’s annual fire conference in Gateshead, from March 10-11th. The call forms a central part of the LGA’s key report ‘The Fire and Rescue Service: Making our Nation Safer’, which is being launched today (Saturday). This document sets out a blueprint for the next government, with a series of proposals for how fire and rescue services can improve fire safety and save the public purse money.\nCllr Jeremy Hilton, Chair of the LGA’s Fire Services Management Committee, said:\n“Many people will be shocked that most landlords are not obliged to install smoke alarms. The current laws are outdated and inadequate – and without question lives are being put at risk.\n“While the majority of private landlords are reputable and voluntarily install alarms, there are a small minority who don’t, needlessly putting lives at risk. They have a duty of care to ensure their tenants are safe.\n“This is why we are calling on the Government to enact the law and ensure all private landlords install smoke alarms – and save hundreds of lives every year.\n“A working smoke alarm can make the difference between life and death and should be seen as every bit as essential as a lock on the front door. By spending just a few pounds, landlords can save lives.\n“In the meantime, we would urge anyone who hasn’t got one fitted already to make sure they are not needlessly putting themselves at risk of the death and destruction fire can cause by getting in touch with their local fire & rescue service requesting a home safety check.”\nMark Cashin, Deputy Chief Fire Officer of Cheshire and Chair of the Chief Fire Officers Association’s Home Safety Committee, said:\n“While death and injuries from fires have reduced considerably in recent years, the majority of victims continue to be those who are most vulnerable, often living in private rented accommodation.\n“This change would improve the safety of families and stop dozens of people from losing their lives to fire each year. The cost to landlords is small, with a ten year sealed alarm costing around £15.”",

Hilton continued by saying that: “We will continue to insist that there is an alternative to the building of a ‘mass burning’ incinerator at Javelin Park such as Mechanical Biological Treatment (MBT).\n“The evidence is clear an incinerator is not needed, not now and not in the future.”\nAlso commenting, Cllr. Mike Collins (LD, Brockworth) said: “I will be seconding this motion next month in order to stop the futility of such a project going ahead.\n“When will the Tories on this council start listening to the people that they represent and those several hundreds who have already signed the online Government petition asking national politicians to challenge the incinerator’s planning application.\n“I simply don’t understand why the Tories are ploughing ahead with their crackpot idea to build such a facility.”\nThe motion will be debated and voted upon at the next full council meeting in Shire Hall on Wednesday 20th February 2013 at 10am.\nENDS\nNotes:\n1.

It threatens the very make up of our county.\n“We believe the proposals would adversely impact on the delivery of important public services currently administered by Gloucestershire County Council, the NHS, the Police and the Local Enterprise Partnership.\n“These organisations have already voiced their serious concerns over the splitting up of our county’s services due to the issue of any new Cotswold authority not only crossing different counties bit different regions too.\n“For us improving services is the most important thing and therefore this proposal which has not been consulted on must have overwhelming support from the people of the Cotswolds and Gloucestershire if it were to happen”.\nThe Liberal Democrat Group Leader, Cllr.

Firstly, in December 2011, the Liberal Democrats lodged what is known as a ‘call-in’ over the selection of a preferred bidder and again another ‘call-in’ was submitted in September 2012 over the Cabinet’s decision to award the contract to Urbaser Balfour Beatty (UBB) before the Council’s planning committee had considered the incinerator application.\nLeader of the Liberal Democrats, Cllr. Jeremy Hilton (LD: Kingsholm and Wotton) who will be leading calls for the review said:\n“From the beginning, we’ve always challenged the process. In making a decision to cancel the incinerator contract at this stage, one needs to be sure of the exact costs involved and whether or not the contract had the necessary break-clauses in place to minimise any potential financial risk to this council.\n“I am not convinced that the £60m-£100m cost to cancel the UBB contract is accurate, but has been instead overly estimated as a scaremongering tactic to stop elected members from voting in favour of cancelling the contract for fear of reprisals to council services.\n“It is only right and responsible for an independent auditor to examine the contract in detail and determine impartially the actual figures involved with cancelling a contract of this nature and at this particular stage.\n“If the figures are proved to be accurate, then, the Tories should be ashamed of themselves in purposefully tying our hands to a stringent and highly inflexible contract that will cost many millions of taxpayers’ money to cancel and detrimentally affect many council services.\n“Until we know fully the costs involved, then, I do not feel that any elected member on Wednesday can make an informed decision over whether or not to cancel the incinerator contract.\n“Labour has been overzealous in calling for the cancellation of the incinerator without first looking at all the costs involved and are playing politics over an important issue, which is simply for the benefit of their parliamentary candidate standing in Stroud. If sensible they too would be asking for such a review.\n“It is time that we stop playing politics with such an important issue and get to the bottom of the real costs involved and whether the process was done correctly from the beginning.”\nDeputy Leader of the Liberal Democrats, Cllr. Iain Dobie (LD: Leckhampton and Warden Hill) also said:\n“If Labour are serious about cancelling this contract then wouldn’t it be better for them to know all the facts and surely if the Tories have nothing to hide then delaying work until the contract has been independently scrutinised would give elected members and residents of Gloucestershire confidence in the current administration.\n“A review of this kind would give elected members like myself who were only elected in 2013 all the facts to make a reasoned and informed decision on whether it really is in the best interests of Gloucestershire to cancel the incinerator contract or not. I believe in transparency and I come to this without any prejudice.\n“Our request is basically that once this review has been completed and a full uncensored report be presented to full council on Wednesday 20th May, then, we shall be in a much better position to make such an important decision.”",

First set is the written questions and answers. The second set are the verbal supplementary questions and answers.\nThe report\nsays the proposed remodelling of Trevone House will provide a resource centre\nfor children and young people, provision of a health assessment unit, an\neducational day service and apartments for young people to be able to learn the\nskills of daily living to prepare them for adulthood. I agree that such a\nfacility for young people in care is required in Gloucestershire, but what\nother properties in the county were considered and where are they located?\nAnswer 1 –\nRichard Boyles\nChildren\nServices over the past few years have considered a number of options in\nrelation to providing provision of placements for children and young people in\ncounty. This has included looking at existing buildings, as well as purchasing\nnew provision, both in urban and more rural areas. Unfortunately, these\nsearches did not identify any potential properties with the scope that is being\noffered from using Trevone House. This project is innovative in its design,\noffering a multi agency approach to our young people. Because of this, it needs\nto be centrally located, accessible both for young people to access community\nresources, but also for staff and partners.\nQuestion 2\n– Jeremy Hilton\nI was only\nbriefed about this proposal on the 11th of April 2019, the day before the\ncabinet report was published. Local residents haven’t been consulted. What\nplans do you have to fully consult local residents, other care institutions and\nlocal schools based in Kingsholm? And will they be listened to?\nAnswer 2 –\nRichard Boyles\nA\ncommunications plan will be implemented, to engage with and listen to local\nresidents, so that everyone has an opportunity to share their views. Our young\nambassadors will be part of this process, bringing to life their journeys,\nworking together not only for the development of this project but also for the\nlife time of the provision, to reduce anxiety, mitigate risks and promote\ncommunity cohesion.\nQuestion 3\n– Jeremy Hilton\nIn paragraph\n3.2, the report says that this proposal will provide accommodation for 16-20\nyear olds. Can you provide me with an assurance that no person will be placed\nat Trevone House who is over the age of 20 years?\nAnswer 3 –\nRichard Boyles\nThis project\nis to support young people moving onto independence from the age of 16 years,\nplanning for them to move on to independent accommodation. In exceptional\ncircumstances, where young people need more time or support due to their\nlearning or emotional needs, consideration would be given for them to remain in\nplacement post 20 years. These young people would have a robust transition plan\nin place.\nQuestion 4\n– Jeremy Hilton\nWill the new\nyoung persons facility at Trevone House be a single gender provision? If not,\nwhat spilt in genders is expected?\nAnswer 4 –\nRichard Boyles\nThe\naccommodation will be co-ed, but this will be in the context of a needs lead\nservice and planned placements. Placement matching is key to the success of\nthis project and a panel will be in place to review placement referrals. This\nwill be multi agency, with colleagues from Health, Police, Children’s Services\nand the provider. The panel will not only review the placement referrals, it\nwill also monitor the young people in placement.\nQuestion 5\n– Jeremy Hilton\nOn Radio\nGloucestershire, (8am on 15th April 2019), Cllr Mark Hawthorne stated that\nthere would be a minimum of 4 members staff on duty 24/7. Is this correct and\nhow many staff will be on duty during the day and over the night?\nAnswer 5 –\nRichard Boyles\nThe whole\nconcept of this project is to support and enable our young people to flourish\nand be aspirational in developing their plans for adulthood. Therefore,\nstaffing is critical, not only in the numbers but the quality and skills of the\nstaff team. There will be a minimum of four staff on duty at any one time, across\nthe whole project. At times, where needed, there will be more staff on duty for\nthose young people who need higher levels of support. Parts of the tendering\nprocess will require potential providers to evidence their staffs skills and\ntraining and supervision standards to ensure they meet the requirements of this.\nGiven the nature of the project, there will be additional staff during the day\nto deliver the day service provision. The project will also have capacity to\nbring in additional staff as required and to support young people in distress,\nparticularly those in need of health assessments\nThe\nfollowing supplementary questions were asked at the meeting\nSupplementary\nQuestion 1 – Jeremy Hilton\nCllr Hilton\nreferred to the large number of care institutions based in Kingsholm and stated\nhow important it was not to overload the community with such facilities.\nSeeking clarification on the answer to his question, Cllr Hilton asked what\nother properties in the county had been considered as possible locations for a\nyoung person’s facility? Cllr Hilton asked Cllr Boyles to provide a written\nanswer to the question, including the reasons why the locations had been\ndismissed as suitable premises.\nResponse\nby: Cllr Richard Boyles (Cabinet Member for Children and Young People)\nCllr Boyles\nexplained that the project to provide a young person’s facility as was proposed\nfour years ago under the IRIS project. After the Ofsted Inspection in 2017, a\nkey part of Gloucestershire’s Sufficiency Strategy expanded the need for a\nwider range of local accommodation options. Cllr Boyles explained that some of\nthe properties that had originally been considered were no longer suitable .\nThe Gloucestershire Sufficiency Strategy aimed to cater for young people in the\ncommunity. Cllr Boyles agreed to provide Cllr Hilton with a written response to\nhis question after the meeting. He stated that, as the terms of the project\ngrew, so did the terms of requirement.\nSupplementary\nQuestion 2 – Jeremy Hilton\nCllr Hilton\nacknowledged there was a communications plan but stressed the importance of\nconsulting with the local community. Cllr Hilton asked for assurance that\nconsultation had been done?\nResponse\nby: Cllr Richard Boyles\nCllr Boyles\nreferred to the clear communications plan which set out the engagements that\nwould be undertaken with the local community on a wide range of issues\nassociated with the project, including bus services, schools and hospitals.\nCllr Boyles agreed to provide a written response to the question after the\nmeeting and assured Cllr Hilton the views of the local community would be\nlistened to.\nSupplementary\nQuestion 3 – Jeremy Hilton\nCllr Hilton\nstated that, in the UK, a person reached maturity and was regarded as an adult\nby the time of their 18th birthday. Cllr Hilton asked Cllr Boyles to guarantee\nno new person over the age of 20 would be placed at Trevone House and that no\none over age 20 would spend their first night in care at the house?\nResponse\nby: Cllr Richard Boyles\nCllr Boyles\nstated he was unable to promise that no one over the age of 20 would be placed\nat Trevone House. He explained some placements could roll over beyond the age\nof 18 and that he would need to consult with the team on the matter. Cllr\nBoyles did not envisage anyone over the age of 20 would be placed at the\nfacility but could not give a definite yes or no at this time.\nSupplementary\nQuestion 4 – Jeremy Hilton\nCllr Hilton\nnoted that the Care Quality Commission and Ofsted were regulators of the\nfacility and asked how often and how rigorous were their inspections expected\nto be?\nResponse\nby: Cllr Richard Boyles\nCllr Boyles\nconfirmed the inspections would be as rigorous as always and that the\ninspection reports would be available as and when the information was provided.\nThe inspections would be annual but may be more frequent.\nSupplementary\nQuestion 5 – Jeremy Hilton\nCllr Hilton\nreferred to a recent briefing with Cllr Boyles and the indication there would\nonly be two people on duty overnight. Cllr Hilton also referred to a recent\nradio interview given by the Leader of the Council, Cllr Mark Hawthorne, where\nit was suggested there would be 4 members of staff on duty 24/7. Cllr Hilton\nsought clarification on how many members of staff would be on duty at the\nfacility from 9pm to 9am?\nResponse\nby: Cllr Richard Boyles\nCllr Boyles\nconfirmed there would be 4 members of staff on duty, once the facility was\nfully open. Until this time, and as the facility developed, the number of staff\ncould be lower, dependent on the number of residents. Cllr Boyles said that\neverything would be risk assessed, with additional staff brought in if the risk\nwas deemed appropriate.\nThe Liberal Democrats are demanding Network Rail delivers on a commitment for hourly direct rail services to London from Gloucester.\nHourly direct services to Paddington were due to start in December 2018 but have been delayed until December 2019 at the earliest.\nCouncillor Jeremy Hilton, leader of Gloucester Liberal Democrats, is calling on Network Rail to deliver the hourly service as part of the forthcoming May 2019 timetable changes for the Great Western mainline.\n“Hourly direct services to London from Gloucester and Cheltenham would be a real economic boost to Gloucestershire and may even encourage businesses to consider moving to the county,” Councillor Hilton said.\n“They would also improve links to the capital for Gloucester’s residents.\n“I understand train operator Great Western Railways is keen to run the services and I would urge Network Rail to bring forward the timetable changes to this May.”\nIt is understood Network Rail has delayed implementing the hourly service due to problems with the timetable changes introduced last year, particularly on the Northern and Thameslink networks.\nNetwork Rail has written to Gloucestershire County Council to inform them that from May there will be a new weekday 9.19am service from Cheltenham to Paddington with a weekday 4.36pm service in the return direction.\nCouncillor Hilton added: “Already, there has been major investment in dual tracking the railway line between Kemble and Swindon. GWR has also invested in new rolling stock.\n“The additional daytime service that is being launched from May is a welcome improvement but we want to see the hourly services that were due to start last year introduced.”\nGround work to improve Wellington Parade Garden on London Road has been delayed. The city council had planned to start construction this month and follow on with the planting of shrubs and plants in April.\nBut, Lib Dem councillors Jeremy Hilton and Isabel Brazil have been told that tenders haven’t even been issued for the work. Tenders have been delayed by the city council’s legal services team.\nCurrently, the garden is closed because it has become a location of problem street drinking. Adults have been drinking alcohol to excess, fighting and arguing between themselves, and using local residents’ front gardens as a toilet. The new garden layout has been designed to be more attractive and to discourage street drinking.\nCllr. Jeremy Hilton (Lib Dem – Kingsholm & Wotton) said: “The delay in construction of the new garden is disappointing, but this is becoming normal with projects run by Gloucester City Council. With so many jobs lost under the Tories’ austerity plan, there are not enough staff to process projects on time. This really is a ‘Vanishing Council’.\n“Isabel Brazil and I have worked hard to get an agreement for improvements to this problem garden. We secured funding to enable works to be done, but to be told last week that it is being delayed by the legal services team, is ridiculous. This is not a big project, but the red tape being applied may cost more than the budget for the actual ground work.”\nCllr. Isabel Brazil (Lib Dem – Kingsholm & Wotton) said: “A new Public Space Protection Order banning the drinking of alcohol in public spaces along London Road recently came into force. The second stage of our action plan is a new layout for the garden that should discourage street drinking. The city council needs to get on with this project.”\nGloucestershire County Council is about to embark on a countywide review of residents’ permit parking zones. It is expected that this will start on 1st of April. We have been assured that Kingsholm will be considered early in the review.\nThe county council will consider the current parking zone areas to see if amendments are required.\nThe following streets will also be considered as potential areas to be included in the residents parking permits scheme.\nArea 1 – North end of Deans Way, Sandhurst Road, Edwy Parade, & Kingsholm Square\nArea 2 – Hinton Road, Malvern Road, North Road & Seabroke Road\nArea 3 – Sebert Street, Oxford Road, Henry Road, Henry Street & Honyatt Road – plus parts of Heathville Road and Denmark Road.\nJeremy Hilton said: “Both Isabel Brazil and I have received a number of requests for residents parking zones to be introduced in Kingsholm. I am disappointed that a review should take place at same time as the permit fees are due to go up. However, there is serious commuter congestion in some streets that can only be resolved with a residents’ permit scheme.”\nIsabel Brazil said: “Changes to the permit zones will only go ahead if supported by a majority of residents living in the area. The county council will fully consult.”\nJeremy Hilton fighting to save the Civil Service Sports Ground\nJeremy Hilton has written to the city council development control team to raise objections to their recommendation to approve Redrow’s planning application 18/00306/FUL to build 100 houses on the former Civil Service Club Sports Ground.\nCllr. Hilton believes this to be inconsistent with the planning committee’s decision on the 4th December when it rejected the application for 89 properties on the same site. The planning committee are meeting on Tuesday the 8th of January at 6pm to determine the application for 100 houses.\nRedrow’s plan for 100 houses on former sports fields, in heart of Kingsholm\nJeremy Hilton has listed ten reasons why the application should be rejected. Here are his objections in full.\nA. Housing Types:\nThe development meets the 20% affordable homes target, with appropriate mix of housing types, but it does not meet the requirement for market housing mix, with no provision for one or two bedroom homes. Kingsholm & Wotton has a good mix of housing and so should any new development in the ward. The applicant proposes 31 three bedroom houses and 49 four bedroom houses. The mix according to SHMA should be 9 one bedroom homes, 23 two bedroom homes, 30 three bedroom homes and 18 four bedroom homes. Rejection on this policy alone would be consistent with the committee decision on the 89 house application.\nB. Land Purchase:\nThe applicants purchased the sports ground from the Civil Service Sports Council Ltd for just £10,000 in 2011 (GR355501). The applicants should publicly declare the details of the uplift clause they have with Civil Service Sports Council Ltd.\nI believe it is this legal agreement that is responsible for the maximisation of housing on the site rather than what one would expect in open discussion with the council and community on a development brief that would benefit all. Some degree of housing whilst retaining the main sports field for sport and recreation, would benefit everyone.\nC. Alternative sport provision:\nIt may be that the land has not been used for sport for more than five years, but that is because of a deliberate policy by the landowners to close the ground for sporting activities.\nI am disappointed that Sport England have changed their objection to the development. I don’t think a cash gift from Redrow of £2m to the city council to be spent elsewhere in Gloucester on sports provision adequately compensates for the loss of the playing fields that are in the heart of Kingsholm.\nThe applicant has been unable to identify alternative provision elsewhere in Kingsholm & Wotton and therefore some sports provision should be retained on site. Spartans Rugby Club that is based in Sherborne Street would support the provision here for an additional rugby pitch for the club to use.\nD. Joint Core Strategy INF3\nThe proposed development of 100 dwellings in my opinion is not consistent with JCS policy on green infrastructure. The former Civil Service Sport Ground provides a worthy green infrastructure asset that should be protected to help resolve the shortage of open space in Kingsholm and Wotton.\nI believe it is not beyond the wit of Redrow Homes to come up with a development solution that would provide much needed housing whilst retaining a large open space that could continue to be used for sport and recreation.\nThe impact on the biodiversity from the wholesale building on the site will be negative. Two badger sets as indicated in the report will disappear if the development proceeds. Trees will be felled. The report also states that the development will create the loss of a foraging area for bats.\nThe proposed tiny public open space is tucked away in the corner of the site giving the impression that it is an exclusive space for residents of the estate rather than one that is inclusive for everyone living in Kingsholm to use. A large percentage of the public open space is set out as a flood attenuation basin, making the space practicably unusable for recreational purposes.\nHere is Policy INF3\nThe green infrastructure network of local and strategic importance will be conserved and enhanced, in order to deliver a series of multifunctional, linked green corridors across the JCS area by: i. Improving the quantity and/or quality of assets; ii. Improving linkages between assets in a manner appropriate to the scale of development, and iii. Designing improvements in a way that supports the cohesive management of green infrastructure;\nDevelopment proposals should consider and contribute positively towards green infrastructure, including the wider landscape context and strategic corridors between major assets and populations. Where new residential development will create, or add to, a need for publicly accessible green space or outdoor space for sports and recreational on, this will be fully met in accordance with Policy INF4. Development at Strategic Allocations will be required to deliver connectivity through the site, linking urban areas with the wider rural hinterland\nExisting green infrastructure will be protected in a manner that reflects its contribution to ecosystem services (including biodiversity, landscape/townscape quality, the historic environment, public access, recreation and play) and the connectivity of the green infrastructure network. Development proposals that will have an impact on woodlands, hedges and trees will need to include a justification for why this impact cannot be avoided and should incorporate measures acceptable to the Local Planning Authority to mitigate the loss. Mitigation should be provided on-site or, where this is not possible, in the immediate environs of the site\nWhere assets are created, retained or replaced within a scheme, they should be properly integrated into the design and contribute to local character and distinctiveness. Proposals should also make provisions for future maintenance of green infrastructure.\nE. Joint Core Strategy INF4\nThe lack of serious community engagement by Redrow ahead of this planning application, about the future use of the site, is lamentable. They locked the gates and closed down the sporting use, even though it was a well used facility.\nRedrow have only presented plans that have proposed the complete building on the site, with the total loss of the playing fields. They have never properly consulted with anyone who lives in Kingsholm.\nThe proposal for provide £148,784.31 towards the Sebert Street Recreation Ground play area has NOT been discussed with the community. This is currently one of the best play areas in the city that was created by the parents of Kingsholm Kids at Play. I am concerned about possible overdevelopment of the Sebert Street Recreational Ground as proposed in the officer’s report. What about Deans Way Meadow? Why is there no onsite provision?\nThere is no clarity in the officer recommendations on what the Section 106 financial agreement will be and what positive impact these will have on the local community.\nI believe Redrow have failed to meet the requirement of Joint Core Strategy policy INF4 for social and community infrastructure\nHere is Policy INF4\nProposals to develop land or buildings currently or previously in use as a community facility will demonstrate, including evidence of engagement with relevant local community groups and partner organisations, why the facility is no longer required and, as appropriate, how, when and where suitable local replacement facilities will be provided. Provision of replacement facilities will have regard to the locational and other relevant elements of this policy\nWhere new residential development will create, or add to, a need for community facilities, it will be fully met as on-site provision and/or as a contribution to facilities or services onsite. New or refurbished provision will be of an appropriate type, standard and size. From an early stage, developers will be expected to engage with the relevant local authorities and infrastructure providers and, as appropriate, relevant local community groups where they exist, to ensure that new provision meets the needs of the community that it will serve and is t for purpose\nSocial and community infrastructure should be centrally located to the population it serves and be easily accessible on foot and by bicycle. It should be located so as to have the potential to be well-served by public transport. Developers should aim to provide flexible, multifunctional facilities within mixed-use developments, creating shared space which maximises benefits to the community and minimises land-take. In the case of open space, ‘easily accessible’ means it is located within reasonable walking distance of the development it serves. New facilities should be accessible to all members of the community, and be planned and phased in parallel with new development.\nF. Joint Core Strategy INF6\nThis development, as did the one for 89 houses, fails to meet the requirement of this policy. The site will increase carbon emissions rather than reduce them with large increase of vehicles into the area around Denmark Road. It will reduce the opportunity to improve the health of local people in the area by reducing the local opportunity for sport and recreation for residents of Kingsholm.\nKingsholm Primary School, which is a vibrant and popular school has expressed concern about their ability to cope with the additional children going to the school and the possible detriment to children from traveller families, who may no longer be able to get it.\nHere is Policy INF6\nWhere infrastructure requirements are generated as a result of individual site proposals and / or having regard to cumulative impact, new development will be served and supported by adequate and appropriate on- and / or off-site infrastructure and services. In identifying infrastructure requirements, development proposals will also demonstrate that full regard has been given, where appropriate, to implementing the requirements of the Joint Core Strategy Infrastructure Delivery Plan\nWhere need for additional infrastructure and services and / or impacts on existing infrastructure and services is expected to arise, the Local Planning Authority will seek to secure appropriate infrastructure which is necessary, directly related, and fairly and reasonably related to the scale and kind of the development proposal, including:\nBroadband infrastructure\nClimate change mitigation/adaptation;\nCommunity and cultural facilities and initiatives;\nEarly Years and Education;\nHealth and well-being facilities and sport, recreation and leisure facilities;\nThe highway network, traffic management, sustainable transport and disabled people’s access;\nProtection of cultural and heritage assets and the potential for their enhancement;\nProtection of environmental assets and the potential for their enhancement;\nProvision of Green Infrastructure including open space;\nPublic realm;\nSafety and security including emergency services.\n3. Priority for provision will be assessed both on a site-by-site basis and having regard to the mitigation of cumulative impact, together with implementation of the JCS Infrastructure Delivery Plan\n4. Planning permission will be granted only where sufficient provision has been made for infrastructure and services (together with their continued maintenance) to meet the needs of new development and / or which are required to mitigate the impact of new development upon existing communities. Infrastructure and services must be provided in line with an agreed, phased timescale and in accordance with other requirements of this Plan.\nG. Draft City Plan Policy SA06\nThe provision of 100 dwellings is in my opinion is overdevelopment of the site, which is in the heart of Kingsholm. Council policy as identified in the draft City Plan, which was approved by council in December 2016, recommends a maximum of 20 dwellings (SA06).\nThe proposal of 100 dwellings exceeds this policy by 500%, with the complete loss of the playing fields.\nA compromise of 40 dwellings, for example, on this site would mean that the former sports field could be brought back into use\nH. Layout of the site:\nThe layout of the site does not follow the usual street pattern that is evident in Kingsholm. It is adjacent to both the Kingsholm and Denmark Road conservation areas.\nI am concerned that the narrow streets on estate may become clogged up with motorists parking their cars on footpaths. This is a problem that will be exacerbated during times when there are rugby matches being played at the Kingsholm stadium.\nIf 89 houses was an overdevelopment of the site as mentioned in the minutes of the December meeting then surely 100 houses is more so. There is still concern about the closeness of houses next to Bijou Court. There are a few areas where the relationships are below 21 metres separation, a concern raised by the planning officer.\nI. Highway access:\nThe proposed access onto Denmark Road is unacceptable. It closes the slip road to Lansdown Road and removes much-needed parking spaces on Denmark Road.\nThe closure of the slip road will create more vehicle conflict at the other junction with Lansdown Road. This will be a particular problem when school coaches use this junction. Parents often park illegally on double yellow lines at this point. The problem will become much worse.\nThe closure of the slip road will also remove the U-turn provision it provides for the houses serviced off the dual carriageway section of Denmark Road on the south side.\nJ. Public open space:\nKingsholm & Wotton has a low level of public open space as identified in the city council’s open spaces strategy. The officer report confirms this to be the case. The council’s public open space standard is 2.8ha per 1000 population.\nBased on the new ward boundaries introduced at the 2016 election the ward has just 0.49ha per 1,000 population. Or 3.59ha for a population based on mid 2016 of 7,259 persons.\nAn opportunity is being missed in the proposed development to achieve a good increase in public open space provision in the ward because of the wholesale development of the site.\nIsabel Brazil & Jeremy Hilton on Sandhurst Lane near to the traffic survey point\nSpeeding motorists travelling on along Sandhurst Lane in Kingsholm and Wotton are a menace say local Lib Dem councillors, Jeremy Hilton and Isabel Brazil.\nA survey carried out between the 16th and 22nd July by Gloucestershire County Council found that 80% of southbound motorists were speeding as they approached St. Oswald’s Road.\nThe survey was requested by county councillor Jeremy Hilton. It was taken at the midway point between Rivermead Close and Greville Close along the built-up section of Sandhurst Lane.\nCllr. Jeremy Hilton said: “The results confirm what many of us already knew that far too many motorists are speeding along Sandhurst Lane. They are breaking the 30mph speed limit and risking the lives of pedestrians walking on the narrow footways.\n“There is a clear road safety issue here that the county council must resolve. I have asked the county traffic manager to propose a solution that will help reduce traffic speeds to below the 30mph limit.\n“Even though the results suggest northbound vehicles are not breaking the limit have seen motorists accelerate aggressively as they pass by Rivermead Close.”\nCllr. Isabel Brazil agreed and said: “Speeding vehicles are a menace, particularly on a lane with narrow or non-existent footways. The county council must do something.”\nOver the seven days of the survey the volume of traffic averaged out at 2,047 vehicles per day.\nSouthbound survey results\nThe survey found that 80% of southbound drivers were travelling at a speed greater than the 30mph limit. The average speed was 39mph with 85% of vehicles travelling at speeds of 47mph or less.\nNorthbound survey results\nOnly 2.5% of northbound vehicles were travelling above the 30mph speed limit. The northbound, traffic kept within the speed limits with an average speed of 21mph and with 85% of vehicles travelling at speeds of 25mph or less.\nClosed by the Tories. Jeremy Hilton outside former Bishop’s College. A lost opportunity to build new comprehensive school here.\nJeremy Hilton has reiterated calls for a new secondary school to be built in the north of the city.\nIt comes after forecasts prepared by the Department for Education reveal a shortfall of 477 secondary school places in Gloucester by 2023/24.\nAcross the country 130,000 children are at risk of missing out on a secondary school place over the next five years, according to the Local Government Association.\nRising birth rates and the thousands of new homes built at Kingsway and Cooper’s Edge has seen increasing pressure for primary school places in Gloucester.\nBut with thousands of new homes planned on the outskirts of Gloucester – at Innsworth, Churchdown and Brockworth as part of the Joint Core Strategy – there will be further demand on school places.\nGloucester Liberal Democrats have long argued there was a need for a new non-selective secondary school in the north of the city as children not attending either Sir Thomas Rich’s or Denmark Road High School for Girls, having to travel to Churchdown, Brockworth, Tewkesbury, Newent, the south of Gloucester or further afield.\nJeremy Hilton said the school should have been built on the former Bishop’s College site in Longlevens but housing is now being built there instead.\nWhen Jeremy and Gloucester Lib Dems first called for a new comprehensive secondary school in the north of Gloucester the then Conservative county council cabinet member for children and young people dismissed it as a “pre-election stunt”.\nBut the need for a new secondary school in Gloucester has now been supported by a report prepared by the county council.\nThe Gloucester City School Places Review said the need for extra primary school places would be met by expanding existing schools and agreements with housing developers to build additional schools.\nBut with secondary schools the review states that there is a “significant shortfall of places from 2022” and a new site for a secondary school in Gloucester should be found.\nThe report also says that existing secondary schools should be expanded where possible.\nCouncillor Jeremy Hilton, said:\n“When we first questioned which secondary schools the children living in all the new family homes being built on the outskirts of Gloucester would go to, the Tories just dismissed our concern.\n“With so many houses planned because of the Joint Core Strategy it was obvious there was going to be further pressure on primary and secondary school places in Gloucester.\n“The Department for Education’s own forecasts support this, and the county council has now realised what we have been saying all along about the need for a new comprehensive secondary school.\n”It is vital that this school is non-selective. A genuine, high performing comprehensive school. There is no need for any further grammar school places. The grammars are already taking far too many pupils that live outside the city and even outside Gloucestershire. The new comprehensive school must be built to serve those that live in the north of Gloucester.”",

The have demanded that the grant of £62,000 is retained.\nThe Lib Dems point out that the grant is already £48,000 smaller that it was in 2011 when the annual funding the CAB received was £110,000. If the grant reduction goes ahead the Gloucester CAB will only get £31,000 from the city council next year. This could mean the Bureau closing one to one and half days a week.\nLib Dem leader, Cllr. Jeremy Hilton said: “The proposal to cut the CAB grant again is mean spirited. The CAB does a brilliant job. It helps people in need. Last year the Bureau dealt with 8,138 clients. That is incredibly good value at £7.62 per client. Reducing the grant to £31,000 will severely harm the effectiveness of the service the CAB provides in Gloucester. It could mean the Bureau closing for one day a week. I say enough is enough, don’t cut the grant to the CAB. It must be kept at £62,000.”\nLib Dem spokesperson for Communities & Neighbourhoods, Cllr. Howard Hyman said: “The proposed cuts to the funding of the CAB are a false economy. For every pound spent many more pounds are saved in the costs to the council, the NHS and other agencies in dealing with the effects of people having nowhere else to turn. The CAB is more than a place to seek comfort. It is a vital lifeline to many people in Gloucester. Every day desperate people walk through the doors of the CAB and are helped by highly trained and caring volunteers with many kinds of concerns such as effects of welfare reforms, rent arrears, debt advice, domestic violence and helping those who are now being denied justice because of the changes to legal aid.”",

This is the unfinished section of the bypass. It’s Gloucester’s missing link.\n“I am very pleased that the cabinet gave approval for the project. Not only will the project improve traffic flow along the bypass, but it should reduce vehicle movements along The Quay and Southgate Street, which motorists are using as an alternative through route.\n“The cabinet member also reassured me today in answer to my questions that the listed wall to Llanthony Priory will be protected during construction and that the new junction to Sudmeadow Road should improve access for residents, businesses and the new Gloucester City Football Club stadium.”",

The Red Cross Fire Emergency Support Service provides invaluable support to Gloucestershire Fire and Rescue Service.\n6) A £10K pot of money to provide support in the form of courses for those approved adopters who adopt older children and teenagers where risk of disruption is recognised to be high. The aim is to further support these placements and reduce the chance of the placement breaking down.\n7) £50K one-off investment package into a number of Road Safety Programmes including a repeat of all Year 5 pupils at Gloucestershire’s primary schools being given the opportunity to have a session at Gloucester’s SkillZone.\n8) That a £20K one-off investment is given to the Child Sexual Exploitation (CSE) Team to work towards doubling the number of children who receive e-Safety in 2015/2016.\nLeader of the Liberal Democrats, Cllr.

We are hopeful that our recommendations will go some way to making a real difference to the lives of Gloucestershire resident’s in 2015/2016.\n“I am especially pleased that support was given for repeating our proposal last year for all Year 5 primary school pupils to undertake a session at SkillZone. Teachers have overwhelmingly reported that their children will be safer after a session.\n“I am also excited by the one-off investment that is to be given to the Red Cross Emergency Support Service. They play a pivotal role in providing the basic amenities and emotional support to those going through the horrific experience of an emergency situation such as a house fire, flood or even road traffic accident.\n“Users of our public libraries will be delighted that free WiFi will be available in all libraries.\n“I’m really looking forward to seeing how small pots of money can make a big difference in Gloucestershire.”\nDeputy Leader of the Liberal Democrats, Cllr. Iain Dobie (LD: Leckhampton and Warden Hill) also said: “We welcome the £100K investment to undertake the necessary feasibility and advance design work in preparation for delivering cycling schemes.\n“Cycling should be for everyone, not just the speedsters in Lycra. We want to break down the barriers to cycling to school or the shops, to work or for leisure.\n“The rewards could be massive: millions of pounds in savings for the NHS, less pollution and congestion, and greater safety and happiness.”\nENDS",

That is the view of the Liberal Democrat group.\nFollowing the decision of the planning committee to refuse planning permission for a £500m waste incinerator at Javelin Park, Liberal Democrat leader Cllr. Jeremy Hilton has written to the chief executive of Gloucestershire County Council requesting work on the project to be halted.\nJeremy Hilton has also asked for confirmation on whether or not the contract between the county council and Urbaser Balfour Beatty has been signed.\nCllr. Jeremy Hilton said: “The planning committee has spoken; in my view the plan to build a mass burn incinerator at Javelin Park should be stopped until after the elections on May 2nd, when a new administration can give fresh instructions to council officers to progress alternative plans.\n“Mechanical Biological Treatment of our residual waste would be much cheaper and more environmentally friendly alternative than burning our waste.”\nIn a letter to the chief executive, Cllr. Hilton requested that no further work be done on the waste incinerator project until new administration was in place. He also asked the council to request UBB from not proceeding with a planning appeal.\nCllr. Simon Wheeler a member of the planning committee said: “The committee came to the only honest conclusion it could in the face of overwhelming argument by members of the public. As a councillor I represent first the wishes of the public.\n“The public have made it absolutely clear that they do not wish to have this monstrosity built at Javelin Park and as such, by the end of the debate, that was the only way I could vote. If only the cabinet of GCC could have taken that principle on board months ago we could have saved every one much pain anguish and tax payers money”\nEnds…\nJavelin Park planning application – reasons for refusal\nThe development conflicts with several development plan policies and whilst WCS14, Structure Plan Policy NHE1, and Stroud District Local Plan Policy NE10 recognise the potential for other public (including social, environmental, and economic) benefits to outweigh harm to the landscape, it is considered as a matter of planning judgement the identified harm is not outweighed by those considerations.\nThe form of the development will introduce a prominent building causing significant loss of the open character and the natural rural appearance to this part of the Severn Vale contrary to WCS Policy 14, WLP Policy 37, Stroud District Local Plan Policy NE10 and paragraph 109 of the NPPF in term of the effect on the intrinsic character of the countryside and Structure Plan Policies NHE1 and S6 (a).\nThe development is outside the Cotswold AONB and views from it including from the Cotswold Way would be generally against the backdrop of the Severn Vale which includes other building development. It is considered that there would be some visual impact which would affect the noted special qualities of the area. We agree with Natural England that significant adverse impacts of the proposal are not outweighed by other considerations. Therefore, as a matter of judgment it is considered that there would be significant harm to the overall setting of the AONB and long distance views. The proposed mitigation measures in the layout and design of the EfW do not overcome this harm contrary to Policy WCS14.\nThe development would lead to harm to the significance of designated heritage assets and that harm is not outweighed by the public benefits of the proposal contrary to Policy WCS16 and Paragraph 134 of the NPPF.\nNotwithstanding the proposed mitigation, the proposed development would have an overbearing effect on nearby residential properties adversely affecting amenity contrary to WLP Policy 37 and Stroud District Local Plan Policy GE1.",

Application reference 16/00968/FUL.\nThis controversial application raised many objections from local residents when it was originally deposited with the council in 2016.\nThe deadline for comments to the Planning Inspectorate from the public was the 9th of August this year. Jeremy Hilton’s letter is below.\nGloucester City Council has still to respond. Within a few weeks the council will take its response to the planning committee for approval, before it is sent to the Planning Inspectorate.\nJeremy Hilton’s Letter to Planning Inspectorate\nI write to ask you to dismiss the appeal by Redrow Homes related to the planning application for 89 houses on the former Civil Service Sports Club ground (Ref:16/00968/FUL).\nI am the local county and city councillor for Kingsholm & Wotton.\nOn the 19th of April 2017, I did write to the case officer at Gloucester City Council pointing out that the application was then seven months old and that it should be determined with a recommendation to refuse.\nThe council said they were giving more time to Redrow to resolve the issue about the loss of sports pitches. Redrow had not in April 2017 nor since provided evidence on how they would mitigate for the loss of the playing fields.\nThere is a shortage of rugby and football pitches in Gloucester. Spartans Ruby Club, which is based in Kingsholm, is looking for an additional pitch near to its club house, which is in neighbouring Sherborne Street.\nThe High School for Girls, which is in Denmark Road has also spoken to me about possible use of the sports field if it is saved from development.\nAll Redrow have done since acquiring the site in 2011 (for just £10,000) is shut the gates and demolish the club house etc, making the facilities unavailable for active sport that it had previously been used for.\nSimilarly, since acquiring the site Redrow have failed to properly discuss the future of the playing fields with the local community that is required in the Joint Core Strategy policy INF4. The lack of community engagement is lamentable.\nRedrow’s idea of consultation has been to lodge two full planning applications with the council, leaving no opportunity for the council or the community to hold discussions about how the site could be developed for some housing, but leaving the rest of the site available for sport and recreation.\nAs Keith Annis a senior manager at Redrow once told me they were playing for time. The question must be asked why has it taken them nearly two years from depositing the planning application to lodge an appeal?\nFor Redrow to appeal against non-determination is rather hypocritical, particularly to do this only a few weeks after lodging a new planning application for 100 dwellings on the same site (Ref 18/00306/FUL)\nFurther Comments\nA. Affordable housing:\nThe plan for affordable homes did not meet the council’s then standard, when the application was submitted, which was 40 %. The application lists 18 dwellings as intermediate housing, this is equates to 20% of the build.\nIt was impossible for the council to approve an application that did not meet this standard. Subsequently, the Joint Core Strategy has been adopted, where the new limit is set at 20%.\nB. Land Purchase:\nThe applicants purchased the sports ground from the Civil Service Sports Council Ltd for just £10,000 in 2011 (GR355501). The applicants should publicly declare the details of the uplift clause they have with Civil Service Sports Council Ltd.\nI believe it is this legal agreement that is responsible for the maximisation of housing on the site rather than what one would expect an open discussion with the council and community on a development brief that would benefit all.\nSome degree of housing whilst retaining the main sports field for sport and recreation, would benefit everyone.\nC. Alternative sport provision:\nIt may be that the land has not been used for sport for more than five years, but that is because of a deliberate policy by the landowners to close the ground for sporting activities.\nI concur with Sport England that the application should be refused.\nThe applicants have failed to identify alternative facilities that could accommodate sporting activities that previously took place on the Civil Service Sports ground.\nIn my opinion, alternative provision must be within the Kingsholm & Wotton ward.\nD. Joint Core Strategy INF3\nThe proposed development of 89 dwellings in my opinion is not consistent with JCS policy on green infrastructure. The former Civil Service Sport Ground provides a worthy green infrastructure asset that should be protected to help resolve the shortage of open space in Kingsholm and Wotton.\nI believe it is not beyond the wit of all parties to come up with a development solution that would provide much needed housing whilst retaining a large open space that could continue to be used for sport and recreation.\nHere is Policy INF3\n1. The green infrastructure network of local and strategic importance will be conserved and enhanced, in order to deliver a series of multifunctional, linked green corridors across the JCS area by:\ni. Improving the quantity and/or quality of assets;\nii. Improving linkages between assets in a manner appropriate to the scale of development, and\niii. Designing improvements in a way that supports the cohesive management of green\ninfrastructure;\n2. Development proposals should consider and contribute positively towards green infrastructure, including the wider landscape context and strategic corridors between major assets and populations. Where new residential development will create, or add to, a need for publicly accessible green space or outdoor space for sports and recreational on, this will be fully met in accordance with Policy INF4. Development at Strategic Alloca ons will be required to deliver connectivity through the site, linking urban areas with the wider rural hinterland\n3. Existing green infrastructure will be protected in a manner that reflects its contribution\nto ecosystem services (including biodiversity, landscape / townscape quality, the historic environment, public access, recreation and play) and the connectivity of the green infrastructure network. Development proposals that will have an impact on woodlands, hedges and trees will need to include a jus ca on for why this impact cannot be avoided and should incorporate measures acceptable to the Local Planning Authority to mi gate the loss. Mi ga on should be provided on-site or, where this is not possible, in the immediate environs of the site\n4. Where assets are created, retained or replaced within a scheme, they should be properly integrated into the design and contribute to local character and distinctiveness. Proposals should also make provisions for future maintenance of green infrastructure.\nE. Joint Core Strategy INF4\nAs I have previously mentioned the lack of serious community engagement by Redrow ahead of this planning application, about the future use of the site, is lamentable.\nRedrow have only showed plans that have proposed the complete building on the site, with the loss of the playing fields. They have never properly consulted anyone.\nI believe they failed to meet the requirement of Joint Core Strategy policy INF4 for social and community infrastructure\nHere is Policy INF4\n1. Proposals to develop land or buildings currently or previously in use as a community facility will demonstrate, including evidence of engagement with relevant local community groups and partner organisations, why the facility is no longer required and, as appropriate, how, when and where suitable local replacement facilities will be provided. Provision of replacement facilities will have regard to the locational and other relevant elements of this policy\n2. Where new residential development will create, or add to, a need for community facilities, it will be fully met as on-site provision and/or as a contribution to facilities or services o -site. New or refurbished provision will be of an appropriate type, standard and size. From an early stage, developers will be expected to engage with the relevant local authorities and infrastructure providers and, as appropriate, relevant local community groups where they exist, to ensure that new provision meets the needs of the community that it will serve and is t for purpose\n3. Social and community infrastructure should be centrally located to the population it serves and\nbe easily accessible on foot and by bicycle. It should be located so as to have the potential to be well-served by public transport. Developers should aim to provide flexible, multifunctional facilities within mixed-use developments, creating shared space which maximises benefits to the community and minimises land-take. In the case of open space, ‘easily accessible’ means it is located within reasonable walking distance of the development it serves. New facilities should be accessible to all members of the community, and be planned and phased in parallel with new development.\nF. Draft City Plan Policy SA06\nThe provision of 89 dwellings is in my opinion is overdevelopment of the site, which is in the heart of Kingsholm.\nCouncil policy as identified in the draft City Plan, which was approved by council in December 2016, recommends a maximum of twenty dwellings (SA06).\nThe proposal of 89 dwellings exceeds this policy by 445%, with the complete loss of the playing fields.\nA compromise of 40 dwellings, for example, on this site would mean that the former sports field could be brought back into use.\nG. Layout of the site:\nThe layout of the site does not follow the usual street pattern that is evident in Kingsholm. It is adjacent to both the Kingsholm and Denmark Road conservation areas.\nI am concerned that the narrow streets on estate may be become clogged up with motorists parking their cars on footpaths. This is a problem that will be exacerbated during times when there are rugby matches being played at the Kingsholm stadium.\nThe small public open space is set out to give the impression that it is an exclusive space just for the new residents of the estate. New public open space should laid out to be inclusive and available to all Kingsholm residents.\nH. Highway access:\nI am not convinced by the design of the access point onto Estcourt Road slip road.\nThe proposed access onto Denmark Road is unacceptable. It closes the slip road to Lansdown Road and removes much-needed parking spaces on Denmark Road.\nThe closure of the slip road will create more vehicle conflict at the other junction with Lansdown Road. This will be a particular problem when school coaches use this junction.\nThe closure of the slip road will also remove the u-turn provision it provides for the houses serviced off the dual carriageway section of Denmark Road on the south side.\nI. Public open space:\nKingsholm & Wotton has a low level of public open space as identified in the city council’s open spaces strategy. The council’s standard is 2.8ha per 1000\nBased on the new ward boundaries introduced at the 2016 election the ward has just 0.49ha per 1,000 population. Or 3.59ha for a population based on mid 2016 of 7,259 persons.\nAn opportunity is being missed in the proposed development to achieve a good increase in public open space provision in the ward by the wholesale development of the site, which was formerly used for sport and recreation.\nI would recommend that this appeal is dismissed.\nYou have covered many points within your letter, but what really rankles within the sports community in Gloucester is the destruction of the buildings for changing facilities a ploy designed to circumvent any sports use whatsover and what about the price, can you say if the sale was put out to tender\nThe land was sold by Civil Service Sports Council Ltd to Redrow Homes for £10,000 in 2011. There will be an uplift clause that means Redrow will have to pay CSSC additional funds if they get planning permission for housing. The sale by CSSC surprised everyone. The land was not owned by the city council\nHi,\nJust read this, as a new resident in Hinton Road, and am amazed at Redrow Homes approach; and certainly back all your comments.\nWhen is there another opportunity for people to get involved?\nNext step is the meeting of the city council’s planning committee that needs to determine its response that will then be part of the submissions that the planning inspectorate will hear. The planning inquiry will be heard next year. You can still write to the city council a raise your objections to both the 89 house and 100 house appplications, if you haven’t done so already.",

Unfortunately, the newly planted shrubs and plants died during the summer and new ones had to be planted.\nAt the 7th December cabinet I challenged the cabinet members to sort out the snags and ensure that the new garden gets regular maintenance. It must become an attractive focal point at this location on London Road.\nThis is my question\n“There have been some teething problems in creating the Wellington Parade Garden on London Road.\n“It’s been redesigned after comprehensive public consultation into a form that should encourage pedestrian movements though it and discourage street drinkers congregating there day after day.\n“Could the cabinet member please give me an assurance that the snagging problems will be resolved, with extra care being given to allowing the shrubs, trees and other plants to become well established in the garden?”\nHere is Cllr. Raymond Padilla’s answer\n“The redevelopment of the site has been completed. The garden was officially opened and available to the public on the 28th October 2022.”\n“Assurances can be given that the snagging problems are being resolved, the shrubs, trees and other plants are being cared for allowing them to become well established in the garden.\n“We are working with Emerging Futures who are currently litter picking as and when required. They are also going to be painting the fence and repairing the fire damaged area.\n“Volunteers will also be planting bulbs to bring some colour to the area for Spring 2023 as well as ongoing upkeep of existing planting.\nHere are some other agreed actions\nStrong guards are to be put around the two trees.\nStreet name plates will be installed for both Great Western Road and Wellington Parade.\nWork will be carried out to ensure the small brick wall cannot be sat on.\nBoth myself and Cllr.

This all follows on from motion 881 put to the county council in September 2021 by the Liberal Democrat group.\nJeremy Hilton who seconded the motion said: “The deadline for submissions was the 27th of November and it has been oversubscribed.\n“There has been no shortage of applications for a grant from the Levelling Up Together fund related to proposed projects in Kingsholm & Wotton. Much more than the £150,000 allocated to my division.\n“I have had my first meeting with officers and Cllr. Hawthorne to look at the proposals. Some are specific to my division and some are multi area applications. My priority is to support those projects that especially help Kingsholm residents who are most in need of additional support, by providing better life opportunities.”\nA decision on which projects will be funded is expected in the New Year.\nMy latest Spotlight newsletter (edition 222).

One of the roads most affected by the loss of family homes being converted into Houses in Multiple Occupation\nA promised housing stock survey in Kingsholm has been delayed yet again by council red-tape. The latest excuse was provided by the Conservative cabinet member in a written answer to a question from Lib Dem councillor for Kingsholm, Cllr. Jeremy Hilton.\nThe survey is planned so that the council can provide definitive evidence that too many family homes in Kingsholm are being converted into Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMO).\nA 130-signature petition was handed into the cabinet by Jeremy Hilton in November 2020.\nThe Petition said:\n“Too many family homes in Kingsholm are being converted into Houses in Multiple Occupation, without planning permission being required. It is currently permitted development for six persons or less.\nI/We the undersigned demand that the city council starts work immediately on preparing evidence and documentation to apply to the Secretary of State to give Kingsholm the protection of an Article 4 Direction. This means that all conversions of family homes into Houses in Multiple Occupation would require planning permission.”\nCllr. Jeremy Hilton said:\n“Lib Dems tried to amend the council plan in July 2020 to get the work started on a housing stock survey, but the Conservatives voted it down.\n“That is why I raised an online petition to get public support. I handed it in at the November 2020 cabinet.\n“Shortly afterwards, I met officers who suggested we schedule the survey work for April this year. Then it was delayed until the summer to be part of a countywide housing survey.\n“Now the Cabinet Member for Planning and Housing Strategy says there have been delays because of legal queries and the tender documents haven’t been issued. It is ridiculous, the word incompetence comes to mind.\nThe written question and the answer published in the council papers of the 23rd of September 2021\n“Kingsholm residents are frustrated by the Conservative council’s reluctance to treat Kingsholm as a special case. We see the onward creep of Houses in Multiple Occupation and the damage done to the community. Parking, noise and litter all contribute to the degradation of our once-quiet streets.”\nJeremy Hilton concluded:\n“It is very frustrating trying to get projects implemented at the city council. We are given dates, then later dates and then sometime never. The Conservatives have cut back so far, nothing seems to get done on time. The council has accurately been described as the ‘vanishing council’.\n“This housing stock survey is critical in getting our planning rules toughened up to protect Kingsholm’s family homes. It cannot be delayed further by red-tape or more accurately blue-tape.”",

It would be disrespectful to the Queen to seek royal status just as a marketing ploy,” said Councillor Hilton.\n“Tourists flock to Gloucester for the cathedral, the docks and 2,000 years of history. Putting ‘royal’ in the title is not going to make a jot of difference to that.\n“Instead of wasting his time renaming Gloucester Paul James should focus on regenerating the city centre.\n“Kings Square is a mess, too many shops lay empty and the subway under the railway station is an absolute disgrace. The city is covered in litter and we have no decent public toilets.\n“Sorting these problems out will bring more tourists to Gloucester and give local people a city to be proud of, not creating a cynical PR marketing campaign.”\nGloucester has a rich royal heritage – Edward II is entombed in the cathedral and Henry III was crowned King in 1216.\n“But Gloucester’s most recent royal connection was in 1643 during the Siege of Gloucester when the forces of King Charles I lay siege to the city,” said Councillor Hilton.\n“The Parliamentary forces successfully withheld the King’s onslaught to prevent Gloucester from falling. Fifty people lost their lives or were wounded defending the parliamentary cause from 10 August and 5 September 1643. This is now remembered each year with Gloucester Day, which takes place on the first Saturday in September. We should be proud of our history and our defence of parliament.\n“Following the return of Charles II to the throne, the King took his revenge upon Gloucester by having its walls torn down and drastically reducing the size of the city’s administrative boundaries.

We will create a modern welcome for visitors to our historic city.\n3) Liberal Democrats in Gloucester are working to ensure there are clean, modern public conveniences in the city centre. The Tory administration’s Community Toilet scheme is a failure, and Gloucester deserves better.\n4) Gloucestershire Airport Ltd (GAL) is owned by the city council, jointly with Cheltenham Borough Council.

Hilton believes this to be inconsistent with the planning committee’s decision on the 4th December when it rejected the application for 89 properties on the same site. The planning committee are meeting on Tuesday the 8th of January at 6pm to determine the application for 100 houses.\nJeremy Hilton has listed ten reasons why the application should be rejected. Here are his objections in full.\nA. Housing Types:\nThe development meets the 20% affordable homes target, with appropriate mix of housing types, but it does not meet the requirement for market housing mix, with no provision for one or two bedroom homes. Kingsholm & Wotton has a good mix of housing and so should any new development in the ward. The applicant proposes 31 three bedroom houses and 49 four bedroom houses. The mix according to SHMA should be 9 one bedroom homes, 23 two bedroom homes, 30 three bedroom homes and 18 four bedroom homes. Rejection on this policy alone would be consistent with the committee decision on the 89 house application.\nB. Land Purchase:\nThe applicants purchased the sports ground from the Civil Service Sports Council Ltd for just £10,000 in 2011 (GR355501). The applicants should publicly declare the details of the uplift clause they have with Civil Service Sports Council Ltd.\nI believe it is this legal agreement that is responsible for the maximisation of housing on the site rather than what one would expect in open discussion with the council and community on a development brief that would benefit all. Some degree of housing whilst retaining the main sports field for sport and recreation, would benefit everyone.\nC. Alternative sport provision:\nIt may be that the land has not been used for sport for more than five years, but that is because of a deliberate policy by the landowners to close the ground for sporting activities.\nI am disappointed that Sport England have changed their objection to the development. I don’t think a cash gift from Redrow of £2m to the city council to be spent elsewhere in Gloucester on sports provision adequately compensates for the loss of the playing fields that are in the heart of Kingsholm.\nThe applicant has been unable to identify alternative provision elsewhere in Kingsholm & Wotton and therefore some sports provision should be retained on site. Spartans Rugby Club that is based in Sherborne Street would support the provision here for an additional rugby pitch for the club to use.\nD. Joint Core Strategy INF3\nThe proposed development of 100 dwellings in my opinion is not consistent with JCS policy on green infrastructure. The former Civil Service Sport Ground provides a worthy green infrastructure asset that should be protected to help resolve the shortage of open space in Kingsholm and Wotton.\nI believe it is not beyond the wit of Redrow Homes to come up with a development solution that would provide much needed housing whilst retaining a large open space that could continue to be used for sport and recreation.\nThe impact on the biodiversity from the wholesale building on the site will be negative. Two badger sets as indicated in the report will disappear if the development proceeds. Trees will be felled. The report also states that the development will create the loss of a foraging area for bats.\nThe proposed tiny public open space is tucked away in the corner of the site giving the impression that it is an exclusive space for residents of the estate rather than one that is inclusive for everyone living in Kingsholm to use. A large percentage of the public open space is set out as a flood attenuation basin, making the space practicably unusable for recreational purposes.\nHere is Policy INF3\n- The green infrastructure network of local and strategic importance will be conserved and enhanced, in order to deliver a series of multifunctional, linked green corridors across the JCS area by:\ni. Improving the quantity and/or quality of assets;\nii. Improving linkages between assets in a manner appropriate to the scale of development, and\niii. Designing improvements in a way that supports the cohesive management of green\ninfrastructure; - Development proposals should consider and contribute positively towards green infrastructure, including the wider landscape context and strategic corridors between major assets and populations. Where new residential development will create, or add to, a need for publicly accessible green space or outdoor space for sports and recreational on, this will be fully met in accordance with Policy INF4. Development at Strategic Allocations will be required to deliver connectivity through the site, linking urban areas with the wider rural hinterland\n- Existing green infrastructure will be protected in a manner that reflects its contribution\nto ecosystem services (including biodiversity, landscape/townscape quality, the historic environment, public access, recreation and play) and the connectivity of the green infrastructure network. Development proposals that will have an impact on woodlands, hedges and trees will need to include a justification for why this impact cannot be avoided and should incorporate measures acceptable to the Local Planning Authority to mitigate the loss. Mitigation should be provided on-site or, where this is not possible, in the immediate environs of the site - Where assets are created, retained or replaced within a scheme, they should be properly integrated into the design and contribute to local character and distinctiveness. Proposals should also make provisions for future maintenance of green infrastructure.\nE. Joint Core Strategy INF4\nThe lack of serious community engagement by Redrow ahead of this planning application, about the future use of the site, is lamentable. They locked the gates and closed down the sporting use, even though it was a well used facility.\nRedrow have only presented plans that have proposed the complete building on the site, with the total loss of the playing fields. They have never properly consulted with anyone who lives in Kingsholm.\nThe proposal for provide £148,784.31 towards the Sebert Street Recreation Ground play area has NOT been discussed with the community. This is currently one of the best play areas in the city that was created by the parents of Kingsholm Kids at Play. I am concerned about possible overdevelopment of the Sebert Street Recreational Ground as proposed in the officer’s report. What about Deans Way Meadow? Why is there no onsite provision?\nThere is no clarity in the officer recommendations on what the Section 106 financial agreement will be and what positive impact these will have on the local community.\nI believe Redrow have failed to meet the requirement of Joint Core Strategy policy INF4 for social and community infrastructure\nHere is Policy INF4\n- Proposals to develop land or buildings currently or previously in use as a community facility will demonstrate, including evidence of engagement with relevant local community groups and partner organisations, why the facility is no longer required and, as appropriate, how, when and where suitable local replacement facilities will be provided. Provision of replacement facilities will have regard to the locational and other relevant elements of this policy\n- Where new residential development will create, or add to, a need for community facilities, it will be fully met as on-site provision and/or as a contribution to facilities or services onsite. New or refurbished provision will be of an appropriate type, standard and size. From an early stage, developers will be expected to engage with the relevant local authorities and infrastructure providers and, as appropriate, relevant local community groups where they exist, to ensure that new provision meets the needs of the community that it will serve and is t for purpose\n- Social and community infrastructure should be centrally located to the population it serves and\nbe easily accessible on foot and by bicycle. It should be located so as to have the potential to be well-served by public transport. Developers should aim to provide flexible, multifunctional facilities within mixed-use developments, creating shared space which maximises benefits to the community and minimises land-take. In the case of open space, ‘easily accessible’ means it is located within reasonable walking distance of the development it serves. New facilities should be accessible to all members of the community, and be planned and phased in parallel with new development.\nF. Joint Core Strategy INF6\nThis development, as did the one for 89 houses, fails to meet the requirement of this policy. The site will increase carbon emissions rather than reduce them with large increase of vehicles into the area around Denmark Road. It will reduce the opportunity to improve the health of local people in the area by reducing the local opportunity for sport and recreation for residents of Kingsholm.\nKingsholm Primary School, which is a vibrant and popular school has expressed concern about their ability to cope with the additional children going to the school and the possible detriment to children from traveller families, who may no longer be able to get it.\nHere is Policy INF6\n- Where infrastructure requirements are generated as a result of individual site proposals and / or having regard to cumulative impact, new development will be served and supported by adequate and appropriate on- and / or off-site infrastructure and services. In identifying infrastructure requirements, development proposals will also demonstrate that full regard has been given, where appropriate, to implementing the requirements of the Joint Core Strategy Infrastructure Delivery Plan\n- Where need for additional infrastructure and services and / or impacts on existing infrastructure and services is expected to arise, the Local Planning Authority will seek to secure appropriate infrastructure which is necessary, directly related, and fairly and reasonably related to the scale and kind of the development proposal, including:\n- Broadband infrastructure\n- Climate change mitigation/adaptation;\n- Community and cultural facilities and initiatives;\n- Early Years and Education;\n- Health and well-being facilities and sport, recreation and leisure facilities;\n- The highway network, traffic management, sustainable transport and disabled people’s access;\n- Protection of cultural and heritage assets and the potential for their enhancement;\n- Protection of environmental assets and the potential for their enhancement;\n- Provision of Green Infrastructure including open space;\n- Public realm;\n- Safety and security including emergency services.\n3. Priority for provision will be assessed both on a site-by-site basis and having regard to the mitigation of cumulative impact, together with implementation of the JCS Infrastructure Delivery Plan\n4. Planning permission will be granted only where sufficient provision has been made for infrastructure and services (together with their continued maintenance) to meet the needs of new development and / or which are required to mitigate the impact of new development upon existing communities. Infrastructure and services must be provided in line with an agreed, phased timescale and in accordance with other requirements of this Plan.\nG. Draft City Plan Policy SA06\nThe provision of 100 dwellings is in my opinion is overdevelopment of the site, which is in the heart of Kingsholm. Council policy as identified in the draft City Plan, which was approved by council in December 2016, recommends a maximum of 20 dwellings (SA06).\nThe proposal of 100 dwellings exceeds this policy by 500%, with the complete loss of the playing fields.\nA compromise of 40 dwellings, for example, on this site would mean that the former sports field could be brought back into use\nH. Layout of the site:\nThe layout of the site does not follow the usual street pattern that is evident in Kingsholm. It is adjacent to both the Kingsholm and Denmark Road conservation areas.\nI am concerned that the narrow streets on estate may become clogged up with motorists parking their cars on footpaths. This is a problem that will be exacerbated during times when there are rugby matches being played at the Kingsholm stadium.\nIf 89 houses was an overdevelopment of the site as mentioned in the minutes of the December meeting then surely 100 houses is more so. There is still concern about the closeness of houses next to Bijou Court. There are a few areas where the relationships are below 21 metres separation, a concern raised by the planning officer.\nI. Highway access:\nThe proposed access onto Denmark Road is unacceptable. It closes the slip road to Lansdown Road and removes much-needed parking spaces on Denmark Road.\nThe closure of the slip road will create more vehicle conflict at the other junction with Lansdown Road. This will be a particular problem when school coaches use this junction. Parents often park illegally on double yellow lines at this point. The problem will become much worse.\nThe closure of the slip road will also remove the U-turn provision it provides for the houses serviced off the dual carriageway section of Denmark Road on the south side.\nJ. Public open space:\nKingsholm & Wotton has a low level of public open space as identified in the city council’s open spaces strategy. The officer report confirms this to be the case. The council’s public open space standard is 2.8ha per 1000 population.\nBased on the new ward boundaries introduced at the 2016 election the ward has just 0.49ha per 1,000 population. Or 3.59ha for a population based on mid 2016 of 7,259 persons.\nAn opportunity is being missed in the proposed development to achieve a good increase in public open space provision in the ward because of the wholesale development of the site.\nI back you 100%. Me & members of my skittle team were devasted when we had our venue taken away. Many family parties etc were had there & lovely memories made! We were told it wasn’t making money but it was always full of sports people etc when we went!\nWe’re told that Cheltenham civil service was being kept but it was a known fact it was not being used or profitable!\ni thought it was all wrong when it happened, it upset a lot of people & clubs.\nIt was only over time that this was going to happen , I’m sure it was planned this way!\nThey were hoping nearby residents would complain that it was over run or unkempt. The purchase price was a joke! I wish I’d had the chance to buy it! Never saw it for sale anywhere! So underhanded.\nMy thoughts go out to you & hope it gets stopped.\nOn my understanding there was a clause to say in whatever whether a will or purchase stipulation that it was to be used for the community.\nI may have been misinformed but that is what I was led to believe.\nBest wishes\nTotally agree with your remarks. The loss of open space in the area is a disgrace.\nThe planning should not be allowed to go ahead. Retention of the playing area should be a priority.\nThis is a ridiculous proposal which will severely impact traffic and therefore, safety to pedestrians round Denmark road. It will reduce outdoor space for residents of the area and is just not necessary when the schools could not cope with additional pupils.\nThis should not be allowed to take place.\nCan see no benefit to the community!",

We will progress the regeneration of our historic city, with more panache and urgency than the current Tory administration.\n“Gloucester City Council needs a new administration that has the energy and ideas to take the city into the 21st Century.”\nDeputy Leader Cllr. Sebastian Field said: “Gloucester as a city is on the up, with regeneration projects happening all across the city. But in many areas of the city, the Conservative council has failed to live up to its promises.\n“Recycling rates are low in this city, and these must improve to avoid fines for sending too much waste to landfill. The Kings Quarter redevelopment has been delayed over and over again, and residents are now tired of waiting.”\nGloucester City Council Liberal Democrat Group 2015 Manifesto\nKeeping Gloucester Moving Forward\nOur Ten Point plan for Gloucester:-\n1) Regeneration of our city is a top priority. King’s Quarter has been delayed again and again. We will make sure that the city centre is not forgotten, and will press developers to deliver on time, with developments that local people actually want.\n2) Our idea to provide free wifi in Gloucester city centre is being implemented. We will make sure it is delivered in time for the Rugby World Cup. We will create a modern welcome for visitors to our historic city.\n3) Liberal Democrats in Gloucester are working to ensure there are clean, modern public conveniences in the city centre. The Tory administration’s Community Toilet scheme is a failure, and Gloucester deserves better.\n4) Gloucestershire Airport Ltd (GAL) is owned by the city council, jointly with Cheltenham Borough Council. We shall continue to support GAL as a general aviation airport to provide jobs and air transport services. We shall also deliver our plans to enhance the railway station and the building of a new central bus station.\n5) We will lobby the government to provide better infrastructure for Gloucester, from roads and public transport, to superfast broadband for all new developments.\n6) We have consistently opposed the massive waste incinerator planned for Javelin Park, Quedgeley. Local Tories on the county council rammed this plan through with the help of UKIP councillors, despite it being unanimously rejected by the planning committee. We will ensure that household waste that is collected by the city council is not burnt in an incinerator when it can be recycled.\n7) Gloucester Liberal Democrats will listen to the residents of Gloucester in making their budget decisions. In these challenging times, councils have to make tough choices and innovate to save money and create revenue. We will listen to all ideas for how best to do this.\n8) Gloucester Cathedral is a magnificent building at the heart of our city. It could be a World Heritage Site, which would make it even more of a tourist attraction. Liberal Democrats chair a group trying to make this happen.\n9) Gloucester has a rich heritage and cultural history. We currently do not have an Arts Council-supported venue in the city, and we would work to make that a reality. Gloucester should be a creative hub for artists, writers, musicians and performers. We will bring more Festivals and events to Gloucester, including a literary festival.\n10) Gloucester Liberal Democrats will ensure that the Rugby World Cup is a fantastic celebration enjoyed by all. The city must be spotlessly clean and there must be adequate facilities to accommodate all the extra fans. The council must work with England Rugby to ensure a lasting legacy from the World Cup. We will assist Gloucester City Football Club to return home to Gloucester in their plans to build a new stadium at Meadow Park.",
  "http_jeremyhilton_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_jeremyhilton_mycouncillor_org_uk_page_5/content_105.html": "Redrow Homes has appealed to the Secretary of State about Gloucester City Council’s non-determination of their planning application to build 89 dwellings on the former Civil Service Sports Ground off Estcourt Road. Application reference 16/00968/FUL.\nThis controversial application raised many objections from local residents when it was originally deposited with the council in 2016.\nThe deadline for comments to the Planning Inspectorate from the public was the 9th of August this year. Jeremy Hilton’s letter is below.\nGloucester City Council has still to respond. Within a few weeks the council will take its response to the planning committee for approval, before it is sent to the Planning Inspectorate.\nJeremy Hilton fighting to save the Civil Service Sports Ground\nJeremy Hilton’s Letter to Planning Inspectorate\nI write to ask you to dismiss the appeal by Redrow Homes related to the planning application for 89 houses on the former Civil Service Sports Club ground (Ref:16/00968/FUL).\nI am the local county and city councillor for Kingsholm & Wotton.\nOn the 19th of April 2017, I did write to the case officer at Gloucester City Council pointing out that the application was then seven months old and that it should be determined with a recommendation to refuse.\nThe council said they were giving more time to Redrow to resolve the issue about the loss of sports pitches. Redrow had not in April 2017 nor since provided evidence on how they would mitigate for the loss of the playing fields.\nThere is a shortage of rugby and football pitches in Gloucester. Spartans Ruby Club, which is based in Kingsholm, is looking for an additional pitch near to its club house, which is in neighbouring Sherborne Street.\nThe High School for Girls, which is in Denmark Road has also spoken to me about possible use of the sports field if it is saved from development.\nAll Redrow have done since acquiring the site in 2011 (for just £10,000) is shut the gates and demolish the club house etc, making the facilities unavailable for active sport that it had previously been used for.\nSimilarly, since acquiring the site Redrow have failed to properly discuss the future of the playing fields with the local community that is required in the Joint Core Strategy policy INF4. The lack of community engagement is lamentable.\nRedrow’s idea of consultation has been to lodge two full planning applications with the council, leaving no opportunity for the council or the community to hold discussions about how the site could be developed for some housing, but leaving the rest of the site available for sport and recreation.\nAs Keith Annis a senior manager at Redrow once told me they were playing for time. The question must be asked why has it taken them nearly two years from depositing the planning application to lodge an appeal?\nFor Redrow to appeal against non-determination is rather hypocritical, particularly to do this only a few weeks after lodging a new planning application for 100 dwellings on the same site (Ref 18/00306/FUL)\nFurther Comments\nA. Affordable housing:\nThe plan for affordable homes did not meet the council’s then standard, when the application was submitted, which was 40 %. The application lists 18 dwellings as intermediate housing, this is equates to 20% of the build.\nIt was impossible for the council to approve an application that did not meet this standard. Subsequently, the Joint Core Strategy has been adopted, where the new limit is set at 20%.\nB. Land Purchase:\nThe applicants purchased the sports ground from the Civil Service Sports Council Ltd for just £10,000 in 2011 (GR355501). The applicants should publicly declare the details of the uplift clause they have with Civil Service Sports Council Ltd.\nI believe it is this legal agreement that is responsible for the maximisation of housing on the site rather than what one would expect an open discussion with the council and community on a development brief that would benefit all.\nSome degree of housing whilst retaining the main sports field for sport and recreation, would benefit everyone.\nC. Alternative sport provision:\nIt may be that the land has not been used for sport for more than five years, but that is because of a deliberate policy by the landowners to close the ground for sporting activities.\nI concur with Sport England that the application should be refused.\nThe applicants have failed to identify alternative facilities that could accommodate sporting activities that previously took place on the Civil Service Sports ground.\nIn my opinion, alternative provision must be within the Kingsholm & Wotton ward.\nD. Joint Core Strategy INF3\nThe proposed development of 89 dwellings in my opinion is not consistent with JCS policy on green infrastructure. The former Civil Service Sport Ground provides a worthy green infrastructure asset that should be protected to help resolve the shortage of open space in Kingsholm and Wotton.\nI believe it is not beyond the wit of all parties to come up with a development solution that would provide much needed housing whilst retaining a large open space that could continue to be used for sport and recreation.\nHere is Policy INF3\n1. The green infrastructure network of local and strategic importance will be conserved and enhanced, in order to deliver a series of multifunctional, linked green corridors across the JCS area by:\ni. Improving the quantity and/or quality of assets;\nii. Improving linkages between assets in a manner appropriate to the scale of development, and\niii. Designing improvements in a way that supports the cohesive management of green\ninfrastructure;\n2. Development proposals should consider and contribute positively towards green infrastructure, including the wider landscape context and strategic corridors between major assets and populations. Where new residential development will create, or add to, a need for publicly accessible green space or outdoor space for sports and recreational on, this will be fully met in accordance with Policy INF4. Development at Strategic Alloca ons will be required to deliver connectivity through the site, linking urban areas with the wider rural hinterland\n3. Existing green infrastructure will be protected in a manner that reflects its contribution\nto ecosystem services (including biodiversity, landscape / townscape quality, the historic environment, public access, recreation and play) and the connectivity of the green infrastructure network. Development proposals that will have an impact on woodlands, hedges and trees will need to include a jus ca on for why this impact cannot be avoided and should incorporate measures acceptable to the Local Planning Authority to mi gate the loss. Mi ga on should be provided on-site or, where this is not possible, in the immediate environs of the site\n4. Where assets are created, retained or replaced within a scheme, they should be properly integrated into the design and contribute to local character and distinctiveness. Proposals should also make provisions for future maintenance of green infrastructure.\nE. Joint Core Strategy INF4\nAs I have previously mentioned the lack of serious community engagement by Redrow ahead of this planning application, about the future use of the site, is lamentable.\nRedrow have only showed plans that have proposed the complete building on the site, with the loss of the playing fields. They have never properly consulted anyone.\nI believe they failed to meet the requirement of Joint Core Strategy policy INF4 for social and community infrastructure\nHere is Policy INF4\n1. Proposals to develop land or buildings currently or previously in use as a community facility will demonstrate, including evidence of engagement with relevant local community groups and partner organisations, why the facility is no longer required and, as appropriate, how, when and where suitable local replacement facilities will be provided. Provision of replacement facilities will have regard to the locational and other relevant elements of this policy\n2. Where new residential development will create, or add to, a need for community facilities, it will be fully met as on-site provision and/or as a contribution to facilities or services o -site. New or refurbished provision will be of an appropriate type, standard and size. From an early stage, developers will be expected to engage with the relevant local authorities and infrastructure providers and, as appropriate, relevant local community groups where they exist, to ensure that new provision meets the needs of the community that it will serve and is t for purpose\n3. Social and community infrastructure should be centrally located to the population it serves and\nbe easily accessible on foot and by bicycle. It should be located so as to have the potential to be well-served by public transport. Developers should aim to provide flexible, multifunctional facilities within mixed-use developments, creating shared space which maximises benefits to the community and minimises land-take. In the case of open space, ‘easily accessible’ means it is located within reasonable walking distance of the development it serves. New facilities should be accessible to all members of the community, and be planned and phased in parallel with new development.\nF. Draft City Plan Policy SA06\nThe provision of 89 dwellings is in my opinion is overdevelopment of the site, which is in the heart of Kingsholm.\nCouncil policy as identified in the draft City Plan, which was approved by council in December 2016, recommends a maximum of twenty dwellings (SA06).\nThe proposal of 89 dwellings exceeds this policy by 445%, with the complete loss of the playing fields.\nA compromise of 40 dwellings, for example, on this site would mean that the former sports field could be brought back into use.\nG. Layout of the site:\nThe layout of the site does not follow the usual street pattern that is evident in Kingsholm. It is adjacent to both the Kingsholm and Denmark Road conservation areas.\nI am concerned that the narrow streets on estate may be become clogged up with motorists parking their cars on footpaths. This is a problem that will be exacerbated during times when there are rugby matches being played at the Kingsholm stadium.\nThe small public open space is set out to give the impression that it is an exclusive space just for the new residents of the estate. New public open space should laid out to be inclusive and available to all Kingsholm residents.\nH. Highway access:\nI am not convinced by the design of the access point onto Estcourt Road slip road.\nThe proposed access onto Denmark Road is unacceptable. It closes the slip road to Lansdown Road and removes much-needed parking spaces on Denmark Road.\nThe closure of the slip road will create more vehicle conflict at the other junction with Lansdown Road.

With so many HMO properties in such close proximity it becomes a street party for them. The houses in this area have beautiful period features, they are being stripped of that and turned into buildings that can never be restored. This is a conservation area.

Jeremy Hilton (LD: Kingsholm & Wotton) who is the Lib Dem national lead on the fire and rescue service at the Local Government Association is firmly opposed to plans of moving the county’s Fire Service under the control of the Police and Crime Commissioner.\nIn commenting, Cllr. Hilton said:\n“Gloucestershire Fire & Rescue Service is one of the best if not the best in the country thanks to the good governance by the county council under all political administrations.\n“Currently it costs £34 per person to operate the Fire Service in Gloucestershire, one of the best rates in the country. To change the governance arrangements of such a service would not only be unnecessary but simply reckless.\n“It is not compulsory for our Police and Crime Commissioner, Mr. Surl to put in a bid and one that could severely damage the superb collaboration that already exists between the blue light services at the county’s Tri-Service Centre in Quedgeley.\n“A recent inspection undertaken by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) and published this month was extremely critical in that Gloucestershire’s Constabulary requires improvement at keeping people safe and reducing crime.\n“The report unfavourably went on to say that the county’s force ‘does not use intelligence well to identify threat or risk of harm within its communities, and its problem – solving activity lacks consistency.\n“This was a damning inspection report of Mr. Surl’s own force, and it would be highly advisable that he gets his own house in order before unnecessary tampering with a fire & rescue service which is not broke and doesn’t require fixing.”\nLiberal Democrat Spokesperson for Fire & Infrastructure, Cllr. Bernie Fisher (St Paul’s & Swindon) also said:\n“There are fundamentally two questions here – one, will transition make it more efficient and less costly to run, and two, will it improve collaboration for better delivery of the service?\n“I very much doubt that such a move will satisfy either of these two questions.\n“Gloucestershire Fire & Rescue Service is part of the County Council and includes other services such as Emergency Management, Trading Standards, Registrars, Coroners and the Road Safety Partnership.\n“The Service is the most cost effective in England and now provides co-responder services to support the ambulance service, targeted work (particularly around dementia), telecare responses (helping to keep people in their own homes) and has led on community resilience (Including Emergency Management and Trading Standards).\n“Their biggest role is now around preventative services for adults. It is a service that now does so much more than putting out fires. To change such a valued and effective service would be foolish.”\nThe Police and Crime Commissioner, Martin Surl, has used the £100K given to him from the Home Office to appoint PA Consultants of Buckingham Palace Road, London to prepare a business case.\nENDS…",

The Liberal Democrats issue their own ‘Statement of Principles’, on which support for a devolution package will only then be determined.\nThe Liberal Democrat agreed principles are as follows:\n1) Liberal Democrats believe that devolution needs to be created by locally led processes and are mindful that devolution as it currently stands to a model set out by Government is not real devolution at all.\n2) Liberal Democrats will only support devolution if Government is genuinely interested in giving power back to local communities, but not if the intention of Government is simply to pass cost-cutting measures onto local authorities under the façade of devolution.\n3) The new responsibilities handed down from Government to Gloucestershire must come with full powers to decide, manage and innovate at a local level.\n4) The Government must ensure that adequate funding is guaranteed now and in the future to support good quality services for residents of the county.\n5) The government must ensure that the new arrangements allow for additional funds to be raised locally or through other legitimate means to support enhanced service provision if that is decided by locally elected members.\n6) The governance arrangements must be cross-party and fully reflect the political proportionality that exists on the councils that make up the new governing board that will oversee the new devolved services.\n7) We will not support the establishment of a metro mayor. Governance of the new additional arrangements must not be handed over to a single person as we believe collective responsibility across all political parties, provides for better services.\n8) If we want democracy alongside devolution, then, we ultimately need a fairer voting system for local government in the form of STV.\nLeader of the Liberal Democrats, Cllr. Jeremy Hilton (LD: Kingsholm and Wotton) said:\n“We are very much in favour of devolving more powers and responsibilities to local areas, but the deal must be right and it must be in the interests of Gloucestershire as a whole.\n“Our ‘Statement of Principles’ are more than just a wish list they are key to us supporting the ‘We are Gloucestershire’ bid, which I believe is being signed and submitted today.\n“There are a number of factors to be considered and the last thing we should be doing is to look at devolution through rose-tinted spectacles. While devolution presents a number of exciting opportunities, it will not be easy to commit to achieving better outcomes at further reduced costs and this ought to be fully realised.\n“Gloucestershire County Council is in no overall control and it is therefore vital that not only public sector partners are consulted, but that all political parties who are a part of the public sector have a say in what is being proposed and what will eventually be agreed.\n“In any deal, the question is: who holds the cards? It is important that through the negotiation process of devolution we don’t allow Government to hold all the cards.\n“I believe our ‘Statement of Principles’ goes some way to making sure that when we are in a position to agree a deal it will ultimately be the right one for Gloucestershire.”\nENDS\nNotes:\n1. Ten of Gloucestershire’s public sector partners have already come together including Gloucestershire Councils, the Police & Crime Commissioner, GFirst Local Enterprise Partnership and Gloucestershire Clinical Commissioning Group to have one conversation with Government about how, through devolution, one can achieve better outcomes and reduced costs.",

The current plan is for the city council to be based on the fifth floor at Shire Hall from 1st April 2019. Shire Hall is the headquarters of the county council.\nThe Liberal Democrat group says the business planning behind the project is ill thought out and the office accommodation will be temporary, too small and the financial savings unsound.\nLib Dem group leader, Cllr. Jeremy Hilton said:\n“Gloucester City Council under Conservative control really is becoming a ‘vanishing council’. The council lacks ambition and is unable to plan long term. The Conservative administration is exhausted and has run out of good ideas. Moving to Shire Hall is a desperate stop gap position. It attempts to save money but doesn’t. The move should be suspended to allow for a full reappraisal.\n“The accommodation at Shire Hall and 92-96 Westgate Street amounts to just 1,175 sqm. This is 78% smaller in size compared to the 5,290 sqm at Herbert, Kimberley and Phillpotts warehouses at the Docks. The Tory cabinet has still not provided opposition councillors with the plans on how it will all be squeezed into such a small space. The public reception advice centre on Westgate Street will be tiny, just 123 sqm compared to current 377 sqm.\n“The council has yet to secure an agreement with the Canals & River Trust about altering the covenant on Herbert, Kimberley and Phillpotts warehouses. Until this is sorted, the buildings cannot be put up for sale. We must not leave these grade II listed buildings empty whilst we find a buyer. In the past, two empty warehouses in the Docks have been destroyed by arson. This could happen again. We should not move out until we have sold the buildings to new owners who have obtained planning permission.\n“The city council needs to acquire new accommodation for the long term. It requires space to grow, especially if the council ends the Amey streetcare contract and brings the service back in house. We should build new offices in the Kings Quarter next to the new bus station. This would help kickstart the regeneration of the immediate area. It would be a bold move repeating the success of the council’s move to the Docks in the 1980’s.\nLib Dem deputy leader, Declan Wilson agreed:\n“The move to Shire Hall is poorly thought out. The financial savings are unsound. The council will still have to pay business rates, the Docks service charge, insurance and security amounting to well over £250,000 per year on HKP warehouses until they have been sold. This is more than double the £102,000 savings suggested in the cabinet report. The council must reassess. The business plan is flawed.”",

Hilton has described the decision made by Cllr. David Norman as another example of the ‘vanishing council’.\nCllr.Jeremy Hilton (Lib Dem – Kingsholm & Wotton) said:\n“Under Conservative control the city council continues to contract and services to the community diminish. It has certainly become a ‘vanishing council’.\n“Last year the cabinet cut the hours the reception was open every day. It now closes at 3pm rather than 5pm as it once did. In future the doors will be closed once a month for a whole day.\n“Residents arriving at the council on the last Wednesday of the month will be shocked and annoyed to see the doors locked to the council offices. If they phone the contact centre they will find their call will be unanswered. They will be frustrated they cannot speak to a person face to face to help solve their enquiry.\n“Due to staff cuts imposed by the Tories, the council’s customer service team is overstretched and no longer has the resilience to cope with the demands placed on it.\n“A good council would keeps its customer reception and contact centre open every working day. It should be able to organise staff training without locking the front doors.\n“This vanishing council is letting the people of Gloucester down. It’s customer advice reception and contact centre should be open every day Monday to Friday.”",

Jeremy Hilton (LD: Kingsholm & Wotton) who is the Lib Dem national lead on the fire and rescue service at the Local Government Association is firmly opposed to plans of moving the county’s Fire Service under the control of the Police and Crime Commissioner.\nIn commenting, Cllr. Hilton said:\n“Gloucestershire Fire & Rescue Service is one of the best if not the best in the country thanks to the good governance by the county council under all political administrations.\n“Currently it costs £34 per person to operate the Fire Service in Gloucestershire, one of the best rates in the country. To change the governance arrangements of such a service would not only be unnecessary but simply reckless.\n“It is not compulsory for our Police and Crime Commissioner, Mr. Surl to put in a bid and one that could severely damage the superb collaboration that already exists between the blue light services at the county’s Tri-Service Centre in Quedgeley.\n“A recent inspection undertaken by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) and published this month was extremely critical in that Gloucestershire’s Constabulary requires improvement at keeping people safe and reducing crime.\n“The report unfavourably went on to say that the county’s force ‘does not use intelligence well to identify threat or risk of harm within its communities, and its problem – solving activity lacks consistency.\n“This was a damning inspection report of Mr. Surl’s own force, and it would be highly advisable that he gets his own house in order before unnecessary tampering with a fire & rescue service which is not broke and doesn’t require fixing.”\nLiberal Democrat Spokesperson for Fire & Infrastructure, Cllr. Bernie Fisher (St Paul’s & Swindon) also said:\n“There are fundamentally two questions here – one, will transition make it more efficient and less costly to run, and two, will it improve collaboration for better delivery of the service?\n“I very much doubt that such a move will satisfy either of these two questions.\n“Gloucestershire Fire & Rescue Service is part of the County Council and includes other services such as Emergency Management, Trading Standards, Registrars, Coroners and the Road Safety Partnership.\n“The Service is the most cost effective in England and now provides co-responder services to support the ambulance service, targeted work (particularly around dementia), telecare responses (helping to keep people in their own homes) and has led on community resilience (Including Emergency Management and Trading Standards).\n“Their biggest role is now around preventative services for adults. It is a service that now does so much more than putting out fires. To change such a valued and effective service would be foolish.”\nThe Police and Crime Commissioner, Martin Surl, has used the £100K given to him from the Home Office to appoint PA Consultants of Buckingham Palace Road, London to prepare a business case.\nENDS…",

The latest excuse was provided by the Conservative cabinet member in a written answer to a question from Lib Dem councillor for Kingsholm, Cllr. Jeremy Hilton.\nThe survey is planned so that the council can provide definitive evidence that too many family homes in Kingsholm are being converted into Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMO).\nA 130-signature petition was handed into the cabinet by Jeremy Hilton in November 2020.\nThe Petition said:\n“Too many family homes in Kingsholm are being converted into Houses in Multiple Occupation, without planning permission being required. It is currently permitted development for six persons or less.\nI/We the undersigned demand that the city council starts work immediately on preparing evidence and documentation to apply to the Secretary of State to give Kingsholm the protection of an Article 4 Direction. This means that all conversions of family homes into Houses in Multiple Occupation would require planning permission.”\nCllr. Jeremy Hilton said:\n“Lib Dems tried to amend the council plan in July 2020 to get the work started on a housing stock survey, but the Conservatives voted it down.\n“That is why I raised an online petition to get public support. I handed it in at the November 2020 cabinet.\n“Shortly afterwards, I met officers who suggested we schedule the survey work for April this year. Then it was delayed until the summer to be part of a countywide housing survey.\n“Now the Cabinet Member for Planning and Housing Strategy says there have been delays because of legal queries and the tender documents haven’t been issued. It is ridiculous, the word incompetence comes to mind.\nKingsholm ward colleague, Cllr. Angela Conder (Lib Dem) said:\n“Kingsholm residents are frustrated by the Conservative council’s reluctance to treat Kingsholm as a special case. We see the onward creep of Houses in Multiple Occupation and the damage done to the community. Parking, noise and litter all contribute to the degradation of our once-quiet streets.”\nJeremy Hilton concluded:\n“It is very frustrating trying to get projects implemented at the city council. We are given dates, then later dates and then sometime never. The Conservatives have cut back so far, nothing seems to get done on time. The council has accurately been described as the ‘vanishing council’.\n“This housing stock survey is critical in getting our planning rules toughened up to protect Kingsholm’s family homes. It cannot be delayed further by red-tape or more accurately blue-tape.”",

It is considered that there would be some visual impact which would affect the noted special qualities of the area. We agree with Natural England that significant adverse impacts of the proposal are not outweighed by other considerations. Therefore, as a matter of judgment it is considered that there would be significant harm to the overall setting of the AONB and long distance views.

Liberal Democrats had long called for a plan B, when it was obvious the original scheme was going nowhere. I welcome the new plan drawn up by the council’s consultants, which will be a genuine mixed use scheme.\nI am pleased that we shall retain Kings Square as a public open space and that it will not be built on as was the case in the original retail led scheme. However, there is still a lot of design work to do in making sure that the refurbished square is something we can all be proud of and enjoy.\nIt is critical that we get the layout of the development and the quality of the architecture right so that the development becomes an impressive gateway into the city centre from both the railway station and bus station. There will also be a new car park with 428 spaces and I hope the designers ensure that it will be a safe and pleasant place to use. The proposed hotel should also be of the quality that will boost Gloucester’s offer and attract people back to the city.\nKings Quarter should also be the location of a modern and good quality indoor market to replace the tired market at the Eastgate Shopping Centre. Markets need a good footfall and the development at Kings Quarter should provide a location near to the transport hubs for specialist market traders to thrive.\nIt will be important that the development is a high quality build and of a design that wins architectural awards. I believe the consultants have got it right in proposing four phases of the development. The inclusion of residential units in the plans must also be welcomed.\nFinally, I do think the city council cabinet has missed a golden opportunity to move its offices to the King’s Quarter. The cabinet is considering selling the offices at Herbert, Kimberly and Phillpotts warehouses and moving into Shire Hall. I think we should seriously consider building new council offices in the King’s Quarter, helping to kickstart the regeneration of this area just as we did in the 1980’s when we moved our offices to the Docks. The business plan does include up to 100,000 sq feet of office space.",

Jeremy Hilton ahead of Conservative cabinet decision to approve their budget has issued the following statement. Total revenue spending for the council will drop by £2m to £417.98m despite an increase of 3.99% in the council tax.\nJeremy Hilton said:\n“The Tories plan to increase the council tax by 3.99%, the first rise in 5 years. Looking at the council’s finances it seems inevitable that the bill to local taxpayers will go up. It is clear the Conservatives are 100% culpable for the financial position the council is in. Despite this tax rise, spending will still drop by £2m next year.\n“The government has slashed the council’s core funding by £18m (9.5%), leaving the council short of funds to maintain services, whilst the Coalition’s ‘council tax freeze grant’ has also been scrapped. In order to make up shortfall in funding for adult care the government has introduced a social care levy, the “Osborne Tax”, which encourages a 2% increase in the council tax to prop up these important services. The Tories are placing the burden on local council taxpayers rather providing central government funding.\n“Locally, the council finances have been damaged by reckless management of council’s finances by Cllr. Hawthorne’s administration. They have squandered £17m in bailing out UBB on the incinerator contract. They have failed to balance the books with a whopping £8.9m overspend in one department, which soaks up 94% of the extra revenue from the 3.99% council tax increase. There will be bigger bills to local people, but cuts in actual funding for county services.\n“Liberal Democrats will be proposing some amendments to the budget, concentrating on roads, health and the environment, which we shall announce next week”",

It would be disrespectful to the Queen to seek royal status just as a marketing ploy,” said Councillor Hilton.\n“Tourists flock to Gloucester for the cathedral, the docks and 2,000 years of history. Putting ‘royal’ in the title is not going to make a jot of difference to that.\n“Instead of wasting his time renaming Gloucester Paul James should focus on regenerating the city centre.\n“Kings Square is a mess, too many shops lay empty and the subway under the railway station is an absolute disgrace. The city is covered in litter and we have no decent public toilets.\n“Sorting these problems out will bring more tourists to Gloucester and give local people a city to be proud of, not creating a cynical PR marketing campaign.”\nGloucester has a rich royal heritage – Edward II is entombed in the cathedral and Henry III was crowned King in 1216.\n“But Gloucester’s most recent royal connection was in 1643 during the Siege of Gloucester when the forces of King Charles I lay siege to the city,” said Councillor Hilton.\n“The Parliamentary forces successfully withheld the King’s onslaught to prevent Gloucester from falling. Fifty people lost their lives or were wounded defending the parliamentary cause from 10 August and 5 September 1643. This is now remembered each year with Gloucester Day, which takes place on the first Saturday in September. We should be proud of our history and our defence of parliament.\n“Following the return of Charles II to the throne, the King took his revenge upon Gloucester by having its walls torn down and drastically reducing the size of the city’s administrative boundaries. Let’s not disrespect our history.”",

The latest excuse was provided by the Conservative cabinet member in a written answer to a question from Lib Dem councillor for Kingsholm, Cllr. Jeremy Hilton.\nThe survey is planned so that the council can provide definitive evidence that too many family homes in Kingsholm are being converted into Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMO).\nA 130-signature petition was handed into the cabinet by Jeremy Hilton in November 2020.\nThe Petition said:\n“Too many family homes in Kingsholm are being converted into Houses in Multiple Occupation, without planning permission being required. It is currently permitted development for six persons or less.\nI/We the undersigned demand that the city council starts work immediately on preparing evidence and documentation to apply to the Secretary of State to give Kingsholm the protection of an Article 4 Direction. This means that all conversions of family homes into Houses in Multiple Occupation would require planning permission.”\nCllr. Jeremy Hilton said:\n“Lib Dems tried to amend the council plan in July 2020 to get the work started on a housing stock survey, but the Conservatives voted it down.\n“That is why I raised an online petition to get public support. I handed it in at the November 2020 cabinet.\n“Shortly afterwards, I met officers who suggested we schedule the survey work for April this year. Then it was delayed until the summer to be part of a countywide housing survey.\n“Now the Cabinet Member for Planning and Housing Strategy says there have been delays because of legal queries and the tender documents haven’t been issued. It is ridiculous, the word incompetence comes to mind.\nKingsholm ward colleague, Cllr. Angela Conder (Lib Dem) said:\n“Kingsholm residents are frustrated by the Conservative council’s reluctance to treat Kingsholm as a special case. We see the onward creep of Houses in Multiple Occupation and the damage done to the community. Parking, noise and litter all contribute to the degradation of our once-quiet streets.”\nJeremy Hilton concluded:\n“It is very frustrating trying to get projects implemented at the city council. We are given dates, then later dates and then sometime never. The Conservatives have cut back so far, nothing seems to get done on time. The council has accurately been described as the ‘vanishing council’.\n“This housing stock survey is critical in getting our planning rules toughened up to protect Kingsholm’s family homes. It cannot be delayed further by red-tape or more accurately blue-tape.”",

There is much concern about the number of homes now being converted into Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMO).\nCurrently, family homes converted into HMOs for six persons or fewer do not require planning permission, as it is permitted development.\nFamily homes are being converted into properties suitable for renting and this can lead to issues with noise, rubbish and parking.\nThere can also be problems with getting landlords to deal with incidents of anti-social behaviour.\nEarlier this year Jeremy Hilton and Isabel Brazil tried to amend the council’s work plan to start on the survey work, which is required as precursor to getting an Article 4 Direction. But the Tories voted it down.\nAn Article 4 Direction would require all conversions to HMO’s to have planning permission.\nIn addressing the cabinet, Jeremy Hilton urged that the cabinet start work now not later. He pointed out that once the council has got an Article 4 Direction, it will still be another 12 months before it would come into force.\nJeremy Hilton said: “There are too many modest family homes in Kingsholm being converted into HMO’s, by absentee landlords. They are just trying to maximise their income. They don’t care about a balanced community. Already, Oxford Road, St Mark Street and Henry Road for example are being overrun by HMO conversions. We need proper regulation. The cabinet must now act on my petition.”\nThe online petition raised 130 signatures mostly from Kingsholm residents.\nIt has been backed by Lib Dem campaigner and resident Angela Conder, a signatory to the petition. She said: “I love living in Kingsholm, but I am worried that new HMOs are being established at far too fast a pace. Rightly, residents are worried about unregulated change that is taking place. We need an Article 4 Direction.”\nThe petition was received by the cabinet member for communities and neighbourhoods. She promised to respond to its request.\nLib Dem councillor Isabel Brazil concluded: “If St Paul’s in Cheltenham can have an Article 4 Direction, requiring planning permission for all new HMOs, then so can Kingsholm. We must protect our community from unregulated change.”",

Residents will always be able to get access as permits will be provided.\nThe ‘school streets’ project at Kingsholm Primary School is will operate for 18 months on a trial basis.\nIn principle, I support school streets as it will remove the hazard of cars parking around the school at these times and reduce the air pollution.\nFor many Kingsholm parents who walk their children to school it way may be beneficial, be safer and healthier for their children.\nParents from other parts of the city who drive their children to school will now have to park further away and walk their children to school.\nThe total budget for the school streets project that also incudes schools in Cheltenham and Tewkesbury is £100,000.\nThe county council is finalising documentation and it will be issuing advice about this project shortly.\nOn the 24th of April the county\ncouncil cabinet, which is controlled by the Conservatives, agreed a plan to\nconvert Trevone House into a resource centre for young people between ages of\n16 and 20.\nTrevone House will provide living\naccommodation for up to 21 young people who are in the care of the county\ncouncil. The facility will have staff on duty 24/7.\nThe young persons’ facility will\nhave a health assessment unit, an educational day service and apartments for\nyoung people to be able to learn the skills of daily living to prepare them for\nadulthood. It will be inspected by Ofsted and the Care Quality Commission.\nThe county council held a public\nconsultation on the 15th of May and another is planned during August.\nHere are the set of questions from Jeremy Hilton that took place at cabinet on the 24th of April. First set is the written questions and answers. The second set are the verbal supplementary questions and answers.\nThe report\nsays the proposed remodelling of Trevone House will provide a resource centre\nfor children and young people, provision of a health assessment unit, an\neducational day service and apartments for young people to be able to learn the\nskills of daily living to prepare them for adulthood. I agree that such a\nfacility for young people in care is required in Gloucestershire, but what\nother properties in the county were considered and where are they located?\nAnswer 1 –\nRichard Boyles\nChildren\nServices over the past few years have considered a number of options in\nrelation to providing provision of placements for children and young people in\ncounty. This has included looking at existing buildings, as well as purchasing\nnew provision, both in urban and more rural areas. Unfortunately, these\nsearches did not identify any potential properties with the scope that is being\noffered from using Trevone House. This project is innovative in its design,\noffering a multi agency approach to our young people. Because of this, it needs\nto be centrally located, accessible both for young people to access community\nresources, but also for staff and partners.\nQuestion 2\n– Jeremy Hilton\nI was only\nbriefed about this proposal on the 11th of April 2019, the day before the\ncabinet report was published. Local residents haven’t been consulted. What\nplans do you have to fully consult local residents, other care institutions and\nlocal schools based in Kingsholm? And will they be listened to?\nAnswer 2 –\nRichard Boyles\nA\ncommunications plan will be implemented, to engage with and listen to local\nresidents, so that everyone has an opportunity to share their views. Our young\nambassadors will be part of this process, bringing to life their journeys,\nworking together not only for the development of this project but also for the\nlife time of the provision, to reduce anxiety, mitigate risks and promote\ncommunity cohesion.\nQuestion 3\n– Jeremy Hilton\nIn paragraph\n3.2, the report says that this proposal will provide accommodation for 16-20\nyear olds. Can you provide me with an assurance that no person will be placed\nat Trevone House who is over the age of 20 years?\nAnswer 3 –\nRichard Boyles\nThis project\nis to support young people moving onto independence from the age of 16 years,\nplanning for them to move on to independent accommodation. In exceptional\ncircumstances, where young people need more time or support due to their\nlearning or emotional needs, consideration would be given for them to remain in\nplacement post 20 years. These young people would have a robust transition plan\nin place.\nQuestion 4\n– Jeremy Hilton\nWill the new\nyoung persons facility at Trevone House be a single gender provision? If not,\nwhat spilt in genders is expected?\nAnswer 4 –\nRichard Boyles\nThe\naccommodation will be co-ed, but this will be in the context of a needs lead\nservice and planned placements. Placement matching is key to the success of\nthis project and a panel will be in place to review placement referrals. This\nwill be multi agency, with colleagues from Health, Police, Children’s Services\nand the provider. The panel will not only review the placement referrals, it\nwill also monitor the young people in placement.\nQuestion 5\n– Jeremy Hilton\nOn Radio\nGloucestershire, (8am on 15th April 2019), Cllr Mark Hawthorne stated that\nthere would be a minimum of 4 members staff on duty 24/7. Is this correct and\nhow many staff will be on duty during the day and over the night?\nAnswer 5 –\nRichard Boyles\nThe whole\nconcept of this project is to support and enable our young people to flourish\nand be aspirational in developing their plans for adulthood. Therefore,\nstaffing is critical, not only in the numbers but the quality and skills of the\nstaff team. There will be a minimum of four staff on duty at any one time, across\nthe whole project. At times, where needed, there will be more staff on duty for\nthose young people who need higher levels of support. Parts of the tendering\nprocess will require potential providers to evidence their staffs skills and\ntraining and supervision standards to ensure they meet the requirements of this.\nGiven the nature of the project, there will be additional staff during the day\nto deliver the day service provision. The project will also have capacity to\nbring in additional staff as required and to support young people in distress,\nparticularly those in need of health assessments\nThe\nfollowing supplementary questions were asked at the meeting\nSupplementary\nQuestion 1 – Jeremy Hilton\nCllr Hilton\nreferred to the large number of care institutions based in Kingsholm and stated\nhow important it was not to overload the community with such facilities.\nSeeking clarification on the answer to his question, Cllr Hilton asked what\nother properties in the county had been considered as possible locations for a\nyoung person’s facility? Cllr Hilton asked Cllr Boyles to provide a written\nanswer to the question, including the reasons why the locations had been\ndismissed as suitable premises.\nResponse\nby: Cllr Richard Boyles (Cabinet Member for Children and Young People)\nCllr Boyles\nexplained that the project to provide a young person’s facility as was proposed\nfour years ago under the IRIS project. After the Ofsted Inspection in 2017, a\nkey part of Gloucestershire’s Sufficiency Strategy expanded the need for a\nwider range of local accommodation options. Cllr Boyles explained that some of\nthe properties that had originally been considered were no longer suitable .\nThe Gloucestershire Sufficiency Strategy aimed to cater for young people in the\ncommunity. Cllr Boyles agreed to provide Cllr Hilton with a written response to\nhis question after the meeting. He stated that, as the terms of the project\ngrew, so did the terms of requirement.\nSupplementary\nQuestion 2 – Jeremy Hilton\nCllr Hilton\nacknowledged there was a communications plan but stressed the importance of\nconsulting with the local community. Cllr Hilton asked for assurance that\nconsultation had been done?\nResponse\nby: Cllr Richard Boyles\nCllr Boyles\nreferred to the clear communications plan which set out the engagements that\nwould be undertaken with the local community on a wide range of issues\nassociated with the project, including bus services, schools and hospitals.\nCllr Boyles agreed to provide a written response to the question after the\nmeeting and assured Cllr Hilton the views of the local community would be\nlistened to.\nSupplementary\nQuestion 3 – Jeremy Hilton\nCllr Hilton\nstated that, in the UK, a person reached maturity and was regarded as an adult\nby the time of their 18th birthday. Cllr Hilton asked Cllr Boyles to guarantee\nno new person over the age of 20 would be placed at Trevone House and that no\none over age 20 would spend their first night in care at the house?\nResponse\nby: Cllr Richard Boyles\nCllr Boyles\nstated he was unable to promise that no one over the age of 20 would be placed\nat Trevone House. He explained some placements could roll over beyond the age\nof 18 and that he would need to consult with the team on the matter. Cllr\nBoyles did not envisage anyone over the age of 20 would be placed at the\nfacility but could not give a definite yes or no at this time.\nSupplementary\nQuestion 4 – Jeremy Hilton\nCllr Hilton\nnoted that the Care Quality Commission and Ofsted were regulators of the\nfacility and asked how often and how rigorous were their inspections expected\nto be?\nResponse\nby: Cllr Richard Boyles\nCllr Boyles\nconfirmed the inspections would be as rigorous as always and that the\ninspection reports would be available as and when the information was provided.\nThe inspections would be annual but may be more frequent.\nSupplementary\nQuestion 5 – Jeremy Hilton\nCllr Hilton\nreferred to a recent briefing with Cllr Boyles and the indication there would\nonly be two people on duty overnight. Cllr Hilton also referred to a recent\nradio interview given by the Leader of the Council, Cllr Mark Hawthorne, where\nit was suggested there would be 4 members of staff on duty 24/7. Cllr Hilton\nsought clarification on how many members of staff would be on duty at the\nfacility from 9pm to 9am?\nResponse\nby: Cllr Richard Boyles\nCllr Boyles\nconfirmed there would be 4 members of staff on duty, once the facility was\nfully open. Until this time, and as the facility developed, the number of staff\ncould be lower, dependent on the number of residents. Cllr Boyles said that\neverything would be risk assessed, with additional staff brought in if the risk\nwas deemed appropriate.",

Jeremy Hilton (LD: Kingsholm & Wotton) who is the Lib Dem national lead on the fire and rescue service at the Local Government Association is firmly opposed to plans of moving the county’s Fire Service under the control of the Police and Crime Commissioner.\nIn commenting, Cllr. Hilton said:\n“Gloucestershire Fire & Rescue Service is one of the best if not the best in the country thanks to the good governance by the county council under all political administrations.\n“Currently it costs £34 per person to operate the Fire Service in Gloucestershire, one of the best rates in the country. To change the governance arrangements of such a service would not only be unnecessary but simply reckless.\n“It is not compulsory for our Police and Crime Commissioner, Mr. Surl to put in a bid and one that could severely damage the superb collaboration that already exists between the blue light services at the county’s Tri-Service Centre in Quedgeley.\n“A recent inspection undertaken by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) and published this month was extremely critical in that Gloucestershire’s Constabulary requires improvement at keeping people safe and reducing crime.\n“The report unfavourably went on to say that the county’s force ‘does not use intelligence well to identify threat or risk of harm within its communities, and its problem – solving activity lacks consistency.\n“This was a damning inspection report of Mr. Surl’s own force, and it would be highly advisable that he gets his own house in order before unnecessary tampering with a fire & rescue service which is not broke and doesn’t require fixing.”\nLiberal Democrat Spokesperson for Fire & Infrastructure, Cllr. Bernie Fisher (St Paul’s & Swindon) also said:\n“There are fundamentally two questions here – one, will transition make it more efficient and less costly to run, and two, will it improve collaboration for better delivery of the service?\n“I very much doubt that such a move will satisfy either of these two questions.\n“Gloucestershire Fire & Rescue Service is part of the County Council and includes other services such as Emergency Management, Trading Standards, Registrars, Coroners and the Road Safety Partnership.\n“The Service is the most cost effective in England and now provides co-responder services to support the ambulance service, targeted work (particularly around dementia), telecare responses (helping to keep people in their own homes) and has led on community resilience (Including Emergency Management and Trading Standards).\n“Their biggest role is now around preventative services for adults. It is a service that now does so much more than putting out fires.

There were just 139 scheduled inspections in the last financial year compared to 366 in 2010/11. This is a worrying trend.

All members of the council are united in their support of the county council remaining the local fire authority.\nAfter spending £100,000 of taxpayers money on employing his own consultants to mount a hostile bid to run the fire and rescue service, Mr Surl dropped his plan during the summer. The cost to the county council in defending its fire authority role was £35,000.\nLiberal Democrat Spokesperson for the Fire Service, Cllr.

  "http_jeremyhilton_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_jeremyhilton_mycouncillor_org_uk_category_gloucester/content_73.html": "Redrow Homes has appealed to the Secretary of State about Gloucester City Council’s non-determination of their planning application to build 89 dwellings on the former Civil Service Sports Ground off Estcourt Road. Application reference 16/00968/FUL.\nThis controversial application raised many objections from local residents when it was originally deposited with the council in 2016.\nThe deadline for comments to the Planning Inspectorate from the public was the 9th of August this year. Jeremy Hilton’s letter is below.\nGloucester City Council has still to respond. Within a few weeks the council will take its response to the planning committee for approval, before it is sent to the Planning Inspectorate.\nJeremy Hilton fighting to save the Civil Service Sports Ground\nJeremy Hilton’s Letter to Planning Inspectorate\nI write to ask you to dismiss the appeal by Redrow Homes related to the planning application for 89 houses on the former Civil Service Sports Club ground (Ref:16/00968/FUL).\nI am the local county and city councillor for Kingsholm & Wotton.\nOn the 19th of April 2017, I did write to the case officer at Gloucester City Council pointing out that the application was then seven months old and that it should be determined with a recommendation to refuse.\nThe council said they were giving more time to Redrow to resolve the issue about the loss of sports pitches. Redrow had not in April 2017 nor since provided evidence on how they would mitigate for the loss of the playing fields.\nThere is a shortage of rugby and football pitches in Gloucester. Spartans Ruby Club, which is based in Kingsholm, is looking for an additional pitch near to its club house, which is in neighbouring Sherborne Street.\nThe High School for Girls, which is in Denmark Road has also spoken to me about possible use of the sports field if it is saved from development.\nAll Redrow have done since acquiring the site in 2011 (for just £10,000) is shut the gates and demolish the club house etc, making the facilities unavailable for active sport that it had previously been used for.\nSimilarly, since acquiring the site Redrow have failed to properly discuss the future of the playing fields with the local community that is required in the Joint Core Strategy policy INF4. The lack of community engagement is lamentable.\nRedrow’s idea of consultation has been to lodge two full planning applications with the council, leaving no opportunity for the council or the community to hold discussions about how the site could be developed for some housing, but leaving the rest of the site available for sport and recreation.\nAs Keith Annis a senior manager at Redrow once told me they were playing for time. The question must be asked why has it taken them nearly two years from depositing the planning application to lodge an appeal?\nFor Redrow to appeal against non-determination is rather hypocritical, particularly to do this only a few weeks after lodging a new planning application for 100 dwellings on the same site (Ref 18/00306/FUL)\nFurther Comments\nA. Affordable housing:\nThe plan for affordable homes did not meet the council’s then standard, when the application was submitted, which was 40 %. The application lists 18 dwellings as intermediate housing, this is equates to 20% of the build.\nIt was impossible for the council to approve an application that did not meet this standard. Subsequently, the Joint Core Strategy has been adopted, where the new limit is set at 20%.\nB. Land Purchase:\nThe applicants purchased the sports ground from the Civil Service Sports Council Ltd for just £10,000 in 2011 (GR355501). The applicants should publicly declare the details of the uplift clause they have with Civil Service Sports Council Ltd.\nI believe it is this legal agreement that is responsible for the maximisation of housing on the site rather than what one would expect an open discussion with the council and community on a development brief that would benefit all.\nSome degree of housing whilst retaining the main sports field for sport and recreation, would benefit everyone.\nC. Alternative sport provision:\nIt may be that the land has not been used for sport for more than five years, but that is because of a deliberate policy by the landowners to close the ground for sporting activities.\nI concur with Sport England that the application should be refused.\nThe applicants have failed to identify alternative facilities that could accommodate sporting activities that previously took place on the Civil Service Sports ground.\nIn my opinion, alternative provision must be within the Kingsholm & Wotton ward.\nD. Joint Core Strategy INF3\nThe proposed development of 89 dwellings in my opinion is not consistent with JCS policy on green infrastructure. The former Civil Service Sport Ground provides a worthy green infrastructure asset that should be protected to help resolve the shortage of open space in Kingsholm and Wotton.\nI believe it is not beyond the wit of all parties to come up with a development solution that would provide much needed housing whilst retaining a large open space that could continue to be used for sport and recreation.\nHere is Policy INF3\n1. The green infrastructure network of local and strategic importance will be conserved and enhanced, in order to deliver a series of multifunctional, linked green corridors across the JCS area by:\ni. Improving the quantity and/or quality of assets;\nii. Improving linkages between assets in a manner appropriate to the scale of development, and\niii. Designing improvements in a way that supports the cohesive management of green\ninfrastructure;\n2. Development proposals should consider and contribute positively towards green infrastructure, including the wider landscape context and strategic corridors between major assets and populations. Where new residential development will create, or add to, a need for publicly accessible green space or outdoor space for sports and recreational on, this will be fully met in accordance with Policy INF4. Development at Strategic Alloca ons will be required to deliver connectivity through the site, linking urban areas with the wider rural hinterland\n3. Existing green infrastructure will be protected in a manner that reflects its contribution\nto ecosystem services (including biodiversity, landscape / townscape quality, the historic environment, public access, recreation and play) and the connectivity of the green infrastructure network. Development proposals that will have an impact on woodlands, hedges and trees will need to include a jus ca on for why this impact cannot be avoided and should incorporate measures acceptable to the Local Planning Authority to mi gate the loss. Mi ga on should be provided on-site or, where this is not possible, in the immediate environs of the site\n4. Where assets are created, retained or replaced within a scheme, they should be properly integrated into the design and contribute to local character and distinctiveness. Proposals should also make provisions for future maintenance of green infrastructure.\nE. Joint Core Strategy INF4\nAs I have previously mentioned the lack of serious community engagement by Redrow ahead of this planning application, about the future use of the site, is lamentable.\nRedrow have only showed plans that have proposed the complete building on the site, with the loss of the playing fields. They have never properly consulted anyone.\nI believe they failed to meet the requirement of Joint Core Strategy policy INF4 for social and community infrastructure\nHere is Policy INF4\n1. Proposals to develop land or buildings currently or previously in use as a community facility will demonstrate, including evidence of engagement with relevant local community groups and partner organisations, why the facility is no longer required and, as appropriate, how, when and where suitable local replacement facilities will be provided. Provision of replacement facilities will have regard to the locational and other relevant elements of this policy\n2. Where new residential development will create, or add to, a need for community facilities, it will be fully met as on-site provision and/or as a contribution to facilities or services o -site. New or refurbished provision will be of an appropriate type, standard and size. From an early stage, developers will be expected to engage with the relevant local authorities and infrastructure providers and, as appropriate, relevant local community groups where they exist, to ensure that new provision meets the needs of the community that it will serve and is t for purpose\n3. Social and community infrastructure should be centrally located to the population it serves and\nbe easily accessible on foot and by bicycle. It should be located so as to have the potential to be well-served by public transport. Developers should aim to provide flexible, multifunctional facilities within mixed-use developments, creating shared space which maximises benefits to the community and minimises land-take. In the case of open space, ‘easily accessible’ means it is located within reasonable walking distance of the development it serves. New facilities should be accessible to all members of the community, and be planned and phased in parallel with new development.\nF. Draft City Plan Policy SA06\nThe provision of 89 dwellings is in my opinion is overdevelopment of the site, which is in the heart of Kingsholm.\nCouncil policy as identified in the draft City Plan, which was approved by council in December 2016, recommends a maximum of twenty dwellings (SA06).\nThe proposal of 89 dwellings exceeds this policy by 445%, with the complete loss of the playing fields.\nA compromise of 40 dwellings, for example, on this site would mean that the former sports field could be brought back into use.\nG. Layout of the site:\nThe layout of the site does not follow the usual street pattern that is evident in Kingsholm. It is adjacent to both the Kingsholm and Denmark Road conservation areas.\nI am concerned that the narrow streets on estate may be become clogged up with motorists parking their cars on footpaths. This is a problem that will be exacerbated during times when there are rugby matches being played at the Kingsholm stadium.\nThe small public open space is set out to give the impression that it is an exclusive space just for the new residents of the estate. New public open space should laid out to be inclusive and available to all Kingsholm residents.\nH. Highway access:\nI am not convinced by the design of the access point onto Estcourt Road slip road.\nThe proposed access onto Denmark Road is unacceptable. It closes the slip road to Lansdown Road and removes much-needed parking spaces on Denmark Road.\nThe closure of the slip road will create more vehicle conflict at the other junction with Lansdown Road. This will be a particular problem when school coaches use this junction.\nThe closure of the slip road will also remove the u-turn provision it provides for the houses serviced off the dual carriageway section of Denmark Road on the south side.\nI. Public open space:\nKingsholm & Wotton has a low level of public open space as identified in the city council’s open spaces strategy. The council’s standard is 2.8ha per 1000\nBased on the new ward boundaries introduced at the 2016 election the ward has just 0.49ha per 1,000 population. Or 3.59ha for a population based on mid 2016 of 7,259 persons.\nAn opportunity is being missed in the proposed development to achieve a good increase in public open space provision in the ward by the wholesale development of the site, which was formerly used for sport and recreation.\nI would recommend that this appeal is dismissed.",

Application reference 16/00968/FUL.\nThis controversial application raised many objections from local residents when it was originally deposited with the council in 2016.\nThe deadline for comments to the Planning Inspectorate from the public was the 9th of August this year. Jeremy Hilton’s letter is below.\nGloucester City Council has still to respond. Within a few weeks the council will take its response to the planning committee for approval, before it is sent to the Planning Inspectorate.\nJeremy Hilton fighting to save the Civil Service Sports Ground\nJeremy Hilton’s Letter to Planning Inspectorate\nI write to ask you to dismiss the appeal by Redrow Homes related to the planning application for 89 houses on the former Civil Service Sports Club ground (Ref:16/00968/FUL).\nI am the local county and city councillor for Kingsholm & Wotton.\nOn the 19th of April 2017, I did write to the case officer at Gloucester City Council pointing out that the application was then seven months old and that it should be determined with a recommendation to refuse.\nThe council said they were giving more time to Redrow to resolve the issue about the loss of sports pitches. Redrow had not in April 2017 nor since provided evidence on how they would mitigate for the loss of the playing fields.\nThere is a shortage of rugby and football pitches in Gloucester. Spartans Ruby Club, which is based in Kingsholm, is looking for an additional pitch near to its club house, which is in neighbouring Sherborne Street.\nThe High School for Girls, which is in Denmark Road has also spoken to me about possible use of the sports field if it is saved from development.\nAll Redrow have done since acquiring the site in 2011 (for just £10,000) is shut the gates and demolish the club house etc, making the facilities unavailable for active sport that it had previously been used for.\nSimilarly, since acquiring the site Redrow have failed to properly discuss the future of the playing fields with the local community that is required in the Joint Core Strategy policy INF4. The lack of community engagement is lamentable.\nRedrow’s idea of consultation has been to lodge two full planning applications with the council, leaving no opportunity for the council or the community to hold discussions about how the site could be developed for some housing, but leaving the rest of the site available for sport and recreation.\nAs Keith Annis a senior manager at Redrow once told me they were playing for time. The question must be asked why has it taken them nearly two years from depositing the planning application to lodge an appeal?\nFor Redrow to appeal against non-determination is rather hypocritical, particularly to do this only a few weeks after lodging a new planning application for 100 dwellings on the same site (Ref 18/00306/FUL)\nFurther Comments\nA. Affordable housing:\nThe plan for affordable homes did not meet the council’s then standard, when the application was submitted, which was 40 %. The application lists 18 dwellings as intermediate housing, this is equates to 20% of the build.\nIt was impossible for the council to approve an application that did not meet this standard. Subsequently, the Joint Core Strategy has been adopted, where the new limit is set at 20%.\nB. Land Purchase:\nThe applicants purchased the sports ground from the Civil Service Sports Council Ltd for just £10,000 in 2011 (GR355501). The applicants should publicly declare the details of the uplift clause they have with Civil Service Sports Council Ltd.\nI believe it is this legal agreement that is responsible for the maximisation of housing on the site rather than what one would expect an open discussion with the council and community on a development brief that would benefit all.\nSome degree of housing whilst retaining the main sports field for sport and recreation, would benefit everyone.\nC. Alternative sport provision:\nIt may be that the land has not been used for sport for more than five years, but that is because of a deliberate policy by the landowners to close the ground for sporting activities.\nI concur with Sport England that the application should be refused.\nThe applicants have failed to identify alternative facilities that could accommodate sporting activities that previously took place on the Civil Service Sports ground.\nIn my opinion, alternative provision must be within the Kingsholm & Wotton ward.\nD. Joint Core Strategy INF3\nThe proposed development of 89 dwellings in my opinion is not consistent with JCS policy on green infrastructure. The former Civil Service Sport Ground provides a worthy green infrastructure asset that should be protected to help resolve the shortage of open space in Kingsholm and Wotton.\nI believe it is not beyond the wit of all parties to come up with a development solution that would provide much needed housing whilst retaining a large open space that could continue to be used for sport and recreation.\nHere is Policy INF3\n1. The green infrastructure network of local and strategic importance will be conserved and enhanced, in order to deliver a series of multifunctional, linked green corridors across the JCS area by:\ni. Improving the quantity and/or quality of assets;\nii. Improving linkages between assets in a manner appropriate to the scale of development, and\niii. Designing improvements in a way that supports the cohesive management of green\ninfrastructure;\n2. Development proposals should consider and contribute positively towards green infrastructure, including the wider landscape context and strategic corridors between major assets and populations. Where new residential development will create, or add to, a need for publicly accessible green space or outdoor space for sports and recreational on, this will be fully met in accordance with Policy INF4. Development at Strategic Alloca ons will be required to deliver connectivity through the site, linking urban areas with the wider rural hinterland\n3. Existing green infrastructure will be protected in a manner that reflects its contribution\nto ecosystem services (including biodiversity, landscape / townscape quality, the historic environment, public access, recreation and play) and the connectivity of the green infrastructure network. Development proposals that will have an impact on woodlands, hedges and trees will need to include a jus ca on for why this impact cannot be avoided and should incorporate measures acceptable to the Local Planning Authority to mi gate the loss. Mi ga on should be provided on-site or, where this is not possible, in the immediate environs of the site\n4. Where assets are created, retained or replaced within a scheme, they should be properly integrated into the design and contribute to local character and distinctiveness. Proposals should also make provisions for future maintenance of green infrastructure.\nE. Joint Core Strategy INF4\nAs I have previously mentioned the lack of serious community engagement by Redrow ahead of this planning application, about the future use of the site, is lamentable.\nRedrow have only showed plans that have proposed the complete building on the site, with the loss of the playing fields. They have never properly consulted anyone.\nI believe they failed to meet the requirement of Joint Core Strategy policy INF4 for social and community infrastructure\nHere is Policy INF4\n1. Proposals to develop land or buildings currently or previously in use as a community facility will demonstrate, including evidence of engagement with relevant local community groups and partner organisations, why the facility is no longer required and, as appropriate, how, when and where suitable local replacement facilities will be provided. Provision of replacement facilities will have regard to the locational and other relevant elements of this policy\n2. Where new residential development will create, or add to, a need for community facilities, it will be fully met as on-site provision and/or as a contribution to facilities or services o -site. New or refurbished provision will be of an appropriate type, standard and size. From an early stage, developers will be expected to engage with the relevant local authorities and infrastructure providers and, as appropriate, relevant local community groups where they exist, to ensure that new provision meets the needs of the community that it will serve and is t for purpose\n3. Social and community infrastructure should be centrally located to the population it serves and\nbe easily accessible on foot and by bicycle. It should be located so as to have the potential to be well-served by public transport. Developers should aim to provide flexible, multifunctional facilities within mixed-use developments, creating shared space which maximises benefits to the community and minimises land-take. In the case of open space, ‘easily accessible’ means it is located within reasonable walking distance of the development it serves. New facilities should be accessible to all members of the community, and be planned and phased in parallel with new development.\nF. Draft City Plan Policy SA06\nThe provision of 89 dwellings is in my opinion is overdevelopment of the site, which is in the heart of Kingsholm.\nCouncil policy as identified in the draft City Plan, which was approved by council in December 2016, recommends a maximum of twenty dwellings (SA06).\nThe proposal of 89 dwellings exceeds this policy by 445%, with the complete loss of the playing fields.\nA compromise of 40 dwellings, for example, on this site would mean that the former sports field could be brought back into use.\nG. Layout of the site:\nThe layout of the site does not follow the usual street pattern that is evident in Kingsholm. It is adjacent to both the Kingsholm and Denmark Road conservation areas.\nI am concerned that the narrow streets on estate may be become clogged up with motorists parking their cars on footpaths. This is a problem that will be exacerbated during times when there are rugby matches being played at the Kingsholm stadium.\nThe small public open space is set out to give the impression that it is an exclusive space just for the new residents of the estate. New public open space should laid out to be inclusive and available to all Kingsholm residents.\nH. Highway access:\nI am not convinced by the design of the access point onto Estcourt Road slip road.\nThe proposed access onto Denmark Road is unacceptable. It closes the slip road to Lansdown Road and removes much-needed parking spaces on Denmark Road.\nThe closure of the slip road will create more vehicle conflict at the other junction with Lansdown Road. This will be a particular problem when school coaches use this junction.\nThe closure of the slip road will also remove the u-turn provision it provides for the houses serviced off the dual carriageway section of Denmark Road on the south side.\nI. Public open space:\nKingsholm & Wotton has a low level of public open space as identified in the city council’s open spaces strategy. The council’s standard is 2.8ha per 1000\nBased on the new ward boundaries introduced at the 2016 election the ward has just 0.49ha per 1,000 population. Or 3.59ha for a population based on mid 2016 of 7,259 persons.\nAn opportunity is being missed in the proposed development to achieve a good increase in public open space provision in the ward by the wholesale development of the site, which was formerly used for sport and recreation.\nI would recommend that this appeal is dismissed.",

The Tory cabinet must do better.”\nEnds…\nMotion for debate\n“This council records its dissatisfaction with the household waste collection services operated by the council’s contractor Amey PLC.\nThis council notes that 2,000 tonnes of recyclable waste is unaccounted for with a market value of £246,000 and that there are stories of recyclable household waste being inappropriately sent to landfill.\nThis council also raises concerns about the quality of the client side management of the streetcare contract overseen by the cabinet.\nThis council, therefore, calls upon the cabinet member for the environment to up his game and increase the frequency of meetings he holds with Amey PLC from current quarterly meetings to monthly meetings until the matter of poor performance by Amey PLC is resolved.”\nProposed by Jeremy Hilton\nSeconded by Declan Wilson",

The facility will have staff on duty 24/7.\nThe young persons’ facility will have a health assessment unit, an educational day service and apartments for young people to be able to learn the skills of daily living to prepare them for adulthood. It will be inspected by Ofsted and the Care Quality Commission.\nThe county council held a public consultation on the 15th of May and another is planned during August.\nHere are the set of questions from Jeremy Hilton that took place at cabinet on the 24th of April. First set is the written questions and answers. The second set are the verbal supplementary questions and answers.\nThe cabinet report can be read online, click here:\nhttp://glostext.gloucestershire.gov.uk/documents/s51904/Item%2011%20-%20Gloucestershires%20Sufficiceny%20Strategy%20-%20Semi-Independent%20Project.pdf\nQuestion 1 – Jeremy Hilton\nThe report says the proposed remodelling of Trevone House will provide a resource centre for children and young people, provision of a health assessment unit, an educational day service and apartments for young people to be able to learn the skills of daily living to prepare them for adulthood. I agree that such a facility for young people in care is required in Gloucestershire, but what other properties in the county were considered and where are they located?\nAnswer 1 – Richard Boyles\nChildren Services over the past few years have considered a number of options in relation to providing provision of placements for children and young people in county. This has included looking at existing buildings, as well as purchasing new provision, both in urban and more rural areas. Unfortunately, these searches did not identify any potential properties with the scope that is being offered from using Trevone House. This project is innovative in its design, offering a multi agency approach to our young people. Because of this, it needs to be centrally located, accessible both for young people to access community resources, but also for staff and partners.\nQuestion 2 – Jeremy Hilton\nI was only briefed about this proposal on the 11th of April 2019, the day before the cabinet report was published. Local residents haven’t been consulted. What plans do you have to fully consult local residents, other care institutions and local schools based in Kingsholm? And will they be listened to?\nAnswer 2 – Richard Boyles\nA communications plan will be implemented, to engage with and listen to local residents, so that everyone has an opportunity to share their views. Our young ambassadors will be part of this process, bringing to life their journeys, working together not only for the development of this project but also for the life time of the provision, to reduce anxiety, mitigate risks and promote community cohesion.\nQuestion 3 – Jeremy Hilton\nIn paragraph 3.2, the report says that this proposal will provide accommodation for 16-20 year olds. Can you provide me with an assurance that no person will be placed at Trevone House who is over the age of 20 years?\nAnswer 3 – Richard Boyles\nThis project is to support young people moving onto independence from the age of 16 years, planning for them to move on to independent accommodation. In exceptional circumstances, where young people need more time or support due to their learning or emotional needs, consideration would be given for them to remain in placement post 20 years. These young people would have a robust transition plan in place.\nQuestion 4 – Jeremy Hilton\nWill the new young persons facility at Trevone House be a single gender provision? If not, what spilt in genders is expected?\nAnswer 4 – Richard Boyles\nThe accommodation will be co-ed, but this will be in the context of a needs lead service and planned placements. Placement matching is key to the success of this project and a panel will be in place to review placement referrals. This will be multi agency, with colleagues from Health, Police, Children’s Services and the provider. The panel will not only review the placement referrals, it will also monitor the young people in placement.\nQuestion 5 – Jeremy Hilton\nOn Radio Gloucestershire, (8am on 15th April 2019), Cllr Mark Hawthorne stated that there would be a minimum of 4 members staff on duty 24/7. Is this correct and how many staff will be on duty during the day and over the night?\nAnswer 5 – Richard Boyles\nThe whole concept of this project is to support and enable our young people to flourish and be aspirational in developing their plans for adulthood. Therefore, staffing is critical, not only in the numbers but the quality and skills of the staff team. There will be a minimum of four staff on duty at any one time, across the whole project. At times, where needed, there will be more staff on duty for those young people who need higher levels of support. Parts of the tendering process will require potential providers to evidence their staffs skills and training and supervision standards to ensure they meet the requirements of this. Given the nature of the project, there will be additional staff during the day to deliver the day service provision. The project will also have capacity to bring in additional staff as required and to support young people in distress, particularly those in need of health assessments\nThe following supplementary questions were asked at the meeting\nSupplementary Question 1 – Jeremy Hilton\nCllr Hilton referred to the large number of care institutions based in Kingsholm and stated how important it was not to overload the community with such facilities. Seeking clarification on the answer to his question, Cllr Hilton asked what other properties in the county had been considered as possible locations for a young person’s facility? Cllr Hilton asked Cllr Boyles to provide a written answer to the question, including the reasons why the locations had been dismissed as suitable premises.\nResponse by: Cllr Richard Boyles (Cabinet Member for Children and Young People)\nCllr Boyles explained that the project to provide a young person’s facility as was proposed four years ago under the IRIS project. After the Ofsted Inspection in 2017, a key part of Gloucestershire’s Sufficiency Strategy expanded the need for a wider range of local accommodation options. Cllr Boyles explained that some of the properties that had originally been considered were no longer suitable . The Gloucestershire Sufficiency Strategy aimed to cater for young people in the community. Cllr Boyles agreed to provide Cllr Hilton with a written response to his question after the meeting. He stated that, as the terms of the project grew, so did the terms of requirement.\nSupplementary Question 2 – Jeremy Hilton\nCllr Hilton acknowledged there was a communications plan but stressed the importance of consulting with the local community. Cllr Hilton asked for assurance that consultation had been done?\nResponse by: Cllr Richard Boyles\nCllr Boyles referred to the clear communications plan which set out the engagements that would be undertaken with the local community on a wide range of issues associated with the project, including bus services, schools and hospitals. Cllr Boyles agreed to provide a written response to the question after the meeting and assured Cllr Hilton the views of the local community would be listened to.\nSupplementary Question 3 – Jeremy Hilton\nCllr Hilton stated that, in the UK, a person reached maturity and was regarded as an adult by the time of their 18th birthday. Cllr Hilton asked Cllr Boyles to guarantee no new person over the age of 20 would be placed at Trevone House and that no one over age 20 would spend their first night in care at the house?\nResponse by: Cllr Richard Boyles\nCllr Boyles stated he was unable to promise that no one over the age of 20 would be placed at Trevone House. He explained some placements could roll over beyond the age of 18 and that he would need to consult with the team on the matter. Cllr Boyles did not envisage anyone over the age of 20 would be placed at the facility but could not give a definite yes or no at this time.\nSupplementary Question 4 – Jeremy Hilton\nCllr Hilton noted that the Care Quality Commission and Ofsted were regulators of the facility and asked how often and how rigorous were their inspections expected to be?\nResponse by: Cllr Richard Boyles\nCllr Boyles confirmed the inspections would be as rigorous as always and that the inspection reports would be available as and when the information was provided. The inspections would be annual but may be more frequent.\nSupplementary Question 5 – Jeremy Hilton\nCllr Hilton referred to a recent briefing with Cllr Boyles and the indication there would only be two people on duty overnight. Cllr Hilton also referred to a recent radio interview given by the Leader of the Council, Cllr Mark Hawthorne, where it was suggested there would be 4 members of staff on duty 24/7. Cllr Hilton sought clarification on how many members of staff would be on duty at the facility from 9pm to 9am?\nResponse by: Cllr Richard Boyles\nCllr Boyles confirmed there would be 4 members of staff on duty, once the facility was fully open. Until this time, and as the facility developed, the number of staff could be lower, dependent on the number of residents. Cllr Boyles said that everything would be risk assessed, with additional staff brought in if the risk was deemed appropriate.",

Today the report of the air pollution task group, chaired by Cllr. Jeremy Hilton (Lib Dem Kingsholm & Wotton), is published.\nAccording to Public Health England, poor air quality is the largest environmental risk to public health in the UK, and the Royal College of Physicians has estimated that poor air quality is responsible for 40,000 premature deaths in the UK annually.\nExposure to air pollution can affect health by contributing to the development of cardiovascular disease, lung cancer, and respiratory diseases, and can limit an individual’s quality of life.\nCllr. Jeremy Hilton said: “Public bodies in Gloucestershire need to do much more to reduce vehicle air pollution. We have a number of poor air quality hot spots in the county. Nitrogen Dioxides and particulate matter from vehicle emissions is a hazard to everyone’s health in the county. We have to take action to reduce these pollutants.\n“I shall be taking the report of the air pollution task group to the Environment & Community Scrutiny Committee next week, where I hope it is approved, before it is sent on to the county cabinet on the 6th of June.”\nThe report has a dozen recommendations that include the establishment of a Gloucestershire Air Quality Partnership to oversee future work. This will be helped by better air quality monitoring with a focus on particulate matter. Changes to planning policies are suggested. Highway interventions are recommended to reduce traffic congestion and air pollution.\nThe task group wishes to encourage the greater use of electric vehicles and also to set stronger targets to increase journeys by bicycle, on foot and public transport. It wants to see the use low emissions buses etc.\nCllr Hilton concluded: “This report is just a start. I would like to that everyone who came along to the workshop we held in January and to the members of the air pollution task group that helped draft the report.”",

Firstly, in December 2011, the Liberal Democrats lodged what is known as a ‘call-in’ over the selection of a preferred bidder and again another ‘call-in’ was submitted in September 2012 over the Cabinet’s decision to award the contract to Urbaser Balfour Beatty (UBB) before the Council’s planning committee had considered the incinerator application.\nLeader of the Liberal Democrats, Cllr. Jeremy Hilton (LD: Kingsholm and Wotton) who will be leading calls for the review said:\n“From the beginning, we’ve always challenged the process. In making a decision to cancel the incinerator contract at this stage, one needs to be sure of the exact costs involved and whether or not the contract had the necessary break-clauses in place to minimise any potential financial risk to this council.\n“I am not convinced that the £60m-£100m cost to cancel the UBB contract is accurate, but has been instead overly estimated as a scaremongering tactic to stop elected members from voting in favour of cancelling the contract for fear of reprisals to council services.\n“It is only right and responsible for an independent auditor to examine the contract in detail and determine impartially the actual figures involved with cancelling a contract of this nature and at this particular stage.\n“If the figures are proved to be accurate, then, the Tories should be ashamed of themselves in purposefully tying our hands to a stringent and highly inflexible contract that will cost many millions of taxpayers’ money to cancel and detrimentally affect many council services.\n“Until we know fully the costs involved, then, I do not feel that any elected member on Wednesday can make an informed decision over whether or not to cancel the incinerator contract.\n“Labour has been overzealous in calling for the cancellation of the incinerator without first looking at all the costs involved and are playing politics over an important issue, which is simply for the benefit of their parliamentary candidate standing in Stroud. If sensible they too would be asking for such a review.\n“It is time that we stop playing politics with such an important issue and get to the bottom of the real costs involved and whether the process was done correctly from the beginning.”\nDeputy Leader of the Liberal Democrats, Cllr. Iain Dobie (LD: Leckhampton and Warden Hill) also said:\n“If Labour are serious about cancelling this contract then wouldn’t it be better for them to know all the facts and surely if the Tories have nothing to hide then delaying work until the contract has been independently scrutinised would give elected members and residents of Gloucestershire confidence in the current administration.\n“A review of this kind would give elected members like myself who were only elected in 2013 all the facts to make a reasoned and informed decision on whether it really is in the best interests of Gloucestershire to cancel the incinerator contract or not. I believe in transparency and I come to this without any prejudice.\n“Our request is basically that once this review has been completed and a full uncensored report be presented to full council on Wednesday 20th May, then, we shall be in a much better position to make such an important decision.”",

The Kings Quarter redevelopment has been delayed over and over again, and residents are now tired of waiting.”\nGloucester City Council Liberal Democrat Group 2015 Manifesto\nKeeping Gloucester Moving Forward\nOur Ten Point plan for Gloucester:-\n1) Regeneration of our city is a top priority. King’s Quarter has been delayed again and again. We will make sure that the city centre is not forgotten, and will press developers to deliver on time, with developments that local people actually want.\n2) Our idea to provide free wifi in Gloucester city centre is being implemented. We will make sure it is delivered in time for the Rugby World Cup. We will create a modern welcome for visitors to our historic city.\n3) Liberal Democrats in Gloucester are working to ensure there are clean, modern public conveniences in the city centre. The Tory administration’s Community Toilet scheme is a failure, and Gloucester deserves better.\n4) Gloucestershire Airport Ltd (GAL) is owned by the city council, jointly with Cheltenham Borough Council. We shall continue to support GAL as a general aviation airport to provide jobs and air transport services. We shall also deliver our plans to enhance the railway station and the building of a new central bus station.\n5) We will lobby the government to provide better infrastructure for Gloucester, from roads and public transport, to superfast broadband for all new developments.\n6) We have consistently opposed the massive waste incinerator planned for Javelin Park, Quedgeley. Local Tories on the county council rammed this plan through with the help of UKIP councillors, despite it being unanimously rejected by the planning committee. We will ensure that household waste that is collected by the city council is not burnt in an incinerator when it can be recycled.\n7) Gloucester Liberal Democrats will listen to the residents of Gloucester in making their budget decisions. In these challenging times, councils have to make tough choices and innovate to save money and create revenue. We will listen to all ideas for how best to do this.\n8) Gloucester Cathedral is a magnificent building at the heart of our city. It could be a World Heritage Site, which would make it even more of a tourist attraction. Liberal Democrats chair a group trying to make this happen.\n9) Gloucester has a rich heritage and cultural history. We currently do not have an Arts Council-supported venue in the city, and we would work to make that a reality. Gloucester should be a creative hub for artists, writers, musicians and performers. We will bring more Festivals and events to Gloucester, including a literary festival.\n10) Gloucester Liberal Democrats will ensure that the Rugby World Cup is a fantastic celebration enjoyed by all. The city must be spotlessly clean and there must be adequate facilities to accommodate all the extra fans. The council must work with England Rugby to ensure a lasting legacy from the World Cup. We will assist Gloucester City Football Club to return home to Gloucester in their plans to build a new stadium at Meadow Park.",

There is much concern about the number of homes now being converted into Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMO).\nCurrently, family homes converted into HMOs for six persons or fewer do not require planning permission, as it is permitted development.\nFamily homes are being converted into properties suitable for renting and this can lead to issues with noise, rubbish and parking.\nThere can also be problems with getting landlords to deal with incidents of anti-social behaviour.\nEarlier this year Jeremy Hilton and Isabel Brazil tried to amend the council’s work plan to start on the survey work, which is required as precursor to getting an Article 4 Direction. But the Tories voted it down.\nAn Article 4 Direction would require all conversions to HMO’s to have planning permission.\nIn addressing the cabinet, Jeremy Hilton urged that the cabinet start work now not later. He pointed out that once the council has got an Article 4 Direction, it will still be another 12 months before it would come into force.\nJeremy Hilton said: “There are too many modest family homes in Kingsholm being converted into HMO’s, by absentee landlords. They are just trying to maximise their income. They don’t care about a balanced community. Already, Oxford Road, St Mark Street and Henry Road for example are being overrun by HMO conversions. We need proper regulation.

She said: “I love living in Kingsholm, but I am worried that new HMOs are being established at far too fast a pace. Rightly, residents are worried about unregulated change that is taking place. We need an Article 4 Direction.”\nThe petition was received by the cabinet member for communities and neighbourhoods. She promised to respond to its request.\nLib Dem councillor Isabel Brazil concluded: “If St Paul’s in Cheltenham can have an Article 4 Direction, requiring planning permission for all new HMOs, then so can Kingsholm.

Whilst the Conservatives have announced that they want to balance the nation’s books entirely by cuts to benefits of the working age poor, Liberal Democrats say they will increase taxes on the wealthiest and cut tax avoidance.\nJeremy Hilton, Parliamentary Candidate for Gloucester, said:\n“We have all had to make sacrifices over the past few years to clear up the financial mess left by Labour. Since the Coalition was formed, we have had to cut spending on benefits and some services though we have protected schools and the NHS.\n“As a local councillor in Gloucester it has been hard for me and my colleagues to make savings in the council budget whilst maintaining the services people pay for.\n“But Lib Dems in Government have also increased taxes on the wealthiest whilst cutting income tax for people on low and middle incomes. This would not have happened if the Conservatives had won a majority at the last General Election and formed a single party Government.\n“Now the Conservatives have announced if they win the election, they will complete the job of balancing the books entirely on the backs of the working age poor. They have revealed their true approach to austerity and public services.\n“Meanwhile Labour appear to have learnt nothing over the past five years. They opposed every cut that needed to be made. If they form a single party Government after the election, they will put back the date when the books are balanced, leaving Britain in more unnecessary debt.\n“Liberal Democrats have announced that we will take a fairer, balanced approach to wiping out the deficit. There will need to be further cuts, including £4 billion on benefits, but we will be raising £6 billion by tackling tax avoidance and £8 billion in increased taxes on the wealthiest and big business. By 2017/18, the books should be balanced and under the Liberal Democrats we will be able to invest again in public services.”",

The proposal to move Elmbridge comes as a complete shock as the previous plan gave no indication to the loss of Elmbridge.\n“I’m pleased Quedgeley has been retained within the Gloucester parliamentary constituency as residents identify far more with Gloucester than Stroud.\n“The key to this review is identity and community and identity and community have been ignored.\n“We campaigned for Longlevens to be moved into Gloucester from Tewkesbury because the people of Longlevens identify far more with Gloucester than Tewkesbury.\n“We thought the Boundary Commission had agreed to returning Longlevens to Gloucester.\n“The furthermost boundary of Longlevens is just a mile from the city centre.

It would be disrespectful to the Queen to seek royal status just as a marketing ploy,” said Councillor Hilton.\n“Tourists flock to Gloucester for the cathedral, the docks and 2,000 years of history. Putting ‘royal’ in the title is not going to make a jot of difference to that.\n“Instead of wasting his time renaming Gloucester Paul James should focus on regenerating the city centre.\n“Kings Square is a mess, too many shops lay empty and the subway under the railway station is an absolute disgrace. The city is covered in litter and we have no decent public toilets.\n“Sorting these problems out will bring more tourists to Gloucester and give local people a city to be proud of, not creating a cynical PR marketing campaign.”\nGloucester has a rich royal heritage – Edward II is entombed in the cathedral and Henry III was crowned King in 1216.\n“But Gloucester’s most recent royal connection was in 1643 during the Siege of Gloucester when the forces of King Charles I lay siege to the city,” said Councillor Hilton.\n“The Parliamentary forces successfully withheld the King’s onslaught to prevent Gloucester from falling. Fifty people lost their lives or were wounded defending the parliamentary cause from 10 August and 5 September 1643. This is now remembered each year with Gloucester Day, which takes place on the first Saturday in September. We should be proud of our history and our defence of parliament.\n“Following the return of Charles II to the throne, the King took his revenge upon Gloucester by having its walls torn down and drastically reducing the size of the city’s administrative boundaries. Let’s not disrespect our history.”\nA Liberal Democrat is urging young people in Gloucester to vote for the Liberal Democrats and to stop a hard Brexit from damaging their futures.\nJeremy Hilton, who has been a councillor in the city for 25 years, said the Liberal Democrats have a raft of policies to give children and young people a brighter future.\nThese include:\nAs well as:\nJeremy Hilton, who is the challenger to the Conservatives in Gloucester, said: “These proposals forms part of a package to build a fairer Britain that is open, tolerant and united and it also ensures no child or young person in the city is left behind.\n“Young people, just starting out in life, should be excited about the future ahead. But instead, many are worried about their prospects and struggling to get by.\n“It isn’t fair that their futures are being disregarded in the EU negotiations and that they are paying the price for a decision they didn’t make.\n“To all the young people in living in Gloucester I want to say – you don’t have to accept Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn’s hard Brexit coalition that will wreck the future for you, your family, your schools and hospitals.\n“Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party let you down by voting with the Tories on Brexit. He ordered his MPs to vote with the Tories and Ukip in favour of Article 50, despite the Government making no concessions to them whatsoever.\n“Nothing is more important to the future of the young voters in this city than Brexit. A hard Brexit deal, with Britain outside the single market, will wreck the future for our children, our economy and our schools and hospitals.\n“That’s why at the heart of the manifesto is a commitment to give the people the final say on the Brexit deal in a referendum. And if you don’t like the deal you should be able to reject it and choose to remain in Europe.”\nGLOUCESTER Conservative candidate Richard Graham is being challenged to say whether he backs his leader Theresa May’s plans to scrap free school lunches.\nJeremy Hilton – his Liberal Democrat opponent in the General Election on June 8 – is challenging Mr Graham to say whether he will vote to take away lunches from hard-pressed families should he be re-elected to Parliament.\nMrs May’s plan to scrap free school lunches could hit children’s health by depriving hundreds of thousands of pupils of their five-a-day, according to the Liberal Democrats.\nUnlike school lunches, there are no nutritional guidelines or minimum portions for breakfasts.\nThis means while pupils currently get at least two to three of their five a day with free lunches, with free breakfasts they could potentially get none.\nCurrent standards would allow school breakfasts to consist mainly of processed breakfast cereals, toast with sweetened spreads, and there would be no limit on the total amount of sugar children can consume.\nMr Hilton, a well-known local councillor in Gloucester, is the main challenger to Mr Graham, who is seeking re-election as city MP.\nIn May’s county council elections, the Liberal Democrats came second in total number of votes cast in Gloucester. Labour finished third.\n“Theresa May’s plans would hit children’s health by depriving them of a free nutritional meal at school,” Mr Hilton said.\n“This is particularly short-sighted when we are struggling with soaring levels of childhood obesity.\n“The Liberal Democrats will protect free school lunches for infants and ensure all primary school children can get a healthy, free lunch a day.\n“The Liberal Democrat manifesto commits to extending free school meals to all children in primary education. We will also promote school breakfast clubs.\n“Richard Graham must make it clear whether he will vote in the House of Commons to take away lunches from hard-pressed families or stand up to Theresa May for the sake of the education and good health of our children.\n“Theresa May should take her inspiration from Jamie Oliver not Oliver Twist.”\nNHS Digital figures from November 2016 show over a fifth of reception children were overweight or obese. In Year 6 over a third of children were overweight or obese.\nEnds…\nThe Liberal Democrats have announced they will invest £39m more in schools and colleges in Gloucestershire over the next parliament.\nThe funding for Gloucestershire would reverse cuts to frontline school and college budgets, protect per pupil funding in real terms and ensure no school loses out from changes to funding arrangements.\n£3.4m of the funding would be spent on protecting the Pupil Premium, introduced by the Liberal Democrats to help the most disadvantaged children.\nA Liberal Democrat parliamentary candidate for Gloucester, Cllr. Jeremy Hilton said:\n“Children in Gloucester and the rest of the county are being taught in overcrowded classes by overworked teachers – but Theresa May doesn’t care.\n“Under the Conservatives, funding per pupil is set to see the biggest cuts in a generation, while billions of pounds are being spent on divisive plans to expand grammars and free schools.\n“Gloucester already has four grammar schools and it doesn’t need any more. What we need is new comprehensive schools to accommodate increasing demand and a growing city. It is ridiculous that 2,000 children leave the city every day to go to a secondary school.\n“This extra £39m of funding would ensure no school and no child loses out.\n“We will reverse savage Tory cuts to school budgets and invest to ensure every child has the opportunity to succeed.”\nLiberal Democrat Leader Tim Farron said:\n“A landslide for the Conservatives would allow Theresa May to take parents across the country for granted and cut our schools to the bone.\n“Only the Liberal Democrats can provide the strong opposition Britain needs to stand up for Gloucester.\n“Vote for the Liberal Democrats and you can change Britain’s future.”\nENDS\nJeremy Hilton and the Liberal Democrats are opposed to any plans for Police and Crime Commissioner Martin Surl taking over the running of the county’s fire service. It is understood that Mr Surl has employed consultants to mount a hostile bid to takeover Gloucestershire’s Fire & Rescue Service.\nThe Tory Government has passed legislation that would allow a hostile takeover by the local PCC, but Jeremy Hilton – who is running to be Gloucester’s next MP – is against the idea.\n“Gloucestershire has one of the best run fire services in the country and should remain under the control of the county council,” he said.\n“Moving the fire service would cost a lot of money and would not deliver any savings to tax payers in Gloucestershire. It would undermine the good collaboration that we have between the emergency services in Gloucestershire. Mr Surl should sort out the police service rather than empire building.”\nJeremy Hilton also confirmed that the Liberal Democrat manifesto commits to replacing police and crime commissioners, elected at great expense in elections with very low turnout, with accountable police boards made up of local councillors.\nGloucester Liberal Democrats have today announced that well-known councillor Jeremy Hilton will be the parliamentary candidate for June’s general election.\nA local man born in Gloucester, Jeremy has 25 years of public service as a local councillor behind him.\nWith the recent county council results putting the Liberal Democrats into second place on the popular vote across Gloucester, Jeremy Hilton is confident that he can mount a serious challenge to the Conservatives in becoming Gloucester’s next MP.\nJeremy said “The Labour party are a lost cause with many previous supporters planning to vote Liberal Democrat this time.\n“As a local resident, I know the city like the back of my hand. I am determined to become Gloucester’s representative at Westminster. The city needs someone who is not afraid to speak up and get things done.”\nOn the big issue of this election, membership of the European Union, Jeremy Hilton, is clear where he stands. He voted yes in 1975 and voted remain in 2016.\nHe supports remaining in the Single Market and the Customs Union were Britain to leave the European Union.\nJeremy Hilton will vote in parliament to give the British people the final say on the Brexit deal.\nHe concluded: “The British people should decide if the Brexit deal is acceptable. If not, we should also have the choice to remain in the EU.”\nGloucester City Council (29 Sept) will debate how the city could better celebrate and remember the events of 1643, when the citizens of Gloucester defended the parliamentary garrison against the royalist forces during the first English Civil War. The Liberal Democrat group will propose the motion.\nFrom 10th August to 5th September 1643 the army of King Charles I besieged Gloucester. The city held out for just short of a month under the leadership of Colonel Massie until it was relieved by parliamentary troops under the command of the Earl of Essex. This was a pivotal turning point in the civil war.\nCllr. Jeremy Hilton who is to propose the motion said: “The revival of Gloucester Day and the parade is one way in which the city remembers the events of 1643 when our ancestors fought on the side of parliament. It was a crucial turning point in the English Civil War. We should be proud of this point in our history. Gloucester fought for parliament and democracy. That is why I am proposing that we set up a cross party working group to see how we can better remember and commemorate the Siege of Gloucester. We should consult the public as well.”\nThe seconder of the motion Cllr Joanne Brown said: “I well remember taking part in the first Gloucester Day parade of the modern era in 2009 and how it brought home to me the great spirit and strong will of the people of Gloucester who stood together during the siege of 1643. Today we can feel proud of the pivotal role our city played in changing the course of the Civil War and I believe that we can do even more to remember and commemorate the events of the siege.”\nEnds….\nText of the notice of motion\n“This council notes that Gloucester Day is a recently reinstated annual day of celebration of the city’s history and culture.\nGloucester Day was first held in the modern era on 5th September 2009, but originally dates from the lifting of the Siege of Gloucester in 1643, during which the city held out against royalist forces during the First English Civil War. The lifting of the siege was celebrated annually in the city for years afterwards but died out in the nineteenth century.\nThis council thanks the organisers of this year’s Gloucester Day celebrations and wishes them well in planning the 2017 celebrations.\nThis council also remembers the sacrifice and determination of the people of Gloucester as they defended the parliamentary garrison (10th August to 5th September 1643) against the besieging army of King Charles I. The siege ended with the arrival of a relieving parliamentary army under the Earl of Essex.\nThis council recognises that the Siege of Gloucester is one of the most important events in the history of this city of which we should all be proud and that we agree to set up a cross party working group to consider what else we can do to remember and commemorate the events of 1643.”\nProposed by Jeremy Hilton\nSeconded by Joanne Brown\nLonglevens will be represented by Gloucester’s MP if proposals by the Boundary Commission are approved.\nThe Liberal Democrats launched a petition earlier this year to show the strength of feeling that Longlevens should be represented by Gloucester’s MP rather than Tewkesbury’s.\nA couple of hundred local people signed the petition – both online and in the Lib Dem Spotlight newsletters – saying identified more with Gloucester than Tewkesbury.\nAmong the comments posted by people signing the petition on the change.org website, include: “This ludicrous situation has to change. Longlevens is part and parcel of GLOUCESTER, not Tewkesbury.”\nAnother said: “I live within the City of Gloucester and wish to be represented by the City MP. It makes no sense to be represented by a town MP 12 miles away.”\nToday the Boundary Commission, the independent agency that reviews Parliamentary boundaries, published its draft proposals to cut the number of MPs in England by 32 to 501.\nIn Gloucester, the Boundary Commission has proposed putting Longlevens back into Gloucester and moving the Quedgeley Fieldcourt and Quedgeley Severn Vale wards into the Stroud constituency.\nCouncillor Jeremy Hilton, the leader of Gloucester Liberal Democrat leader, said: “I am really pleased that the Boundary Commission is proposing to move Longlevens back into Gloucester.\n“Residents in Longlevens identify with Gloucester, so it is only right that local people are represented by the city’s MP.\n“I am also pleased the Boundary Commission has not resurrected previous plans to move the heart of Gloucester, including the cathedral and city centre, into the Forest of Dean.”\nMr Hilton said earlier this year the Conservatives had appeared lukewarm to his suggestion and comments about the Boundary Commission’s proposals supported that view.\n“In the summer Tewkesbury MP Laurence Robertson was against moving Longlevens back to Gloucester and Richard Graham was not bothered about reclaiming Longlevens,” he said.\n“The Liberal Democrats plan to make submissions to the Boundary Commission to ensure its initial proposals to include Longlevens are adopted. However, we will look closely at the south of the city and see if we can propose a solution that retains Quedgeley as well.”\nResponding to the announcement that responsibility for the fire service will be transferred from the Department for Communities and Local Government to the Home Office minister for Policing and for Justice, Cllr Jeremy Hilton, Chair of the LGA’s Fire Services Management Committee, which represents all 46 English fire authorities, said:\n“The fire and rescue service is a high performing public service embedding within the local government family and run by local councillors who sit on English fire and rescue authorities.\nThe recent response to the flooding in Cumbria, Lancashire, Northumberland and Yorkshire has demonstrated that firefighters do a brilliant job assisting those in need whilst working closely alongside the other emergency and public services.\nThe LGA’s view is that transferring government responsibility from DCLG to the Home Office must not undermine the superb job our fighters provide in times of emergency.\nI look forward to working closely with the Mike Penning MP the new fire minister in supporting our firefighters and fire & rescue authorities in the excellent work they do.”",

The proposal to axe 60 job comes from the Conservatives who control the council.\nGloucester City Council is to see its funding from the Conservative government cut by £1.755m. Already the council has failed to fill 30 vacancies and another 30 jobs will be lost next year. Liberal Democrat councillors have said the staff shortages have led to delays and non-delivery of vital improvement projects.\nLib Dem leader, Cllr. Jeremy Hilton said: “The loss of so many jobs will have a major impact on council services. Sixty fulltime jobs going equates to 102,120 hours of support for key projects being lost forever. Already we are suffering from a diminished service from the council and it is going to get worse. Important improvement projects will not get done or will be delayed. It’s depressing. The Tories seem hooked on perpetual austerity.”\nLib Dem Deputy leader, Cllr. Declan Wilson said: “The blame for the loss of so many jobs must be shared between the Conservatives on the council and at Westminster. Budget cuts go on forever. This year the funding from Whitehall is being slashed by 18%. This is grossly unfair. On top of that we have had mismanagement of the council’s finances by the Tories leading to extra avoidable costs. The leader should apologise personally to the staff that will lose their jobs.”",

Lib Dems have described the ‘garden waste tax’ as ‘daylight robbery’. They blame the Conservative council and government in equal proportion.\nThe current charge for garden waste collection is £36 per year. The charge was introduced in 2011 to cover the cost of collection on this non-statutory service. Lib Dems discovered in 2016 that the council was profiteering from the collection by around £6 per bin, making a profit of £110,000 a year.

Both Labour and Tory councillors rejected our proposal. Now the Conservatives plan to increase the charge to £44. This is a tax on responsible householders who recycle their garden waste. It’s daylight robbery.”\nLib Dem Deputy leader, Declan Wilson said: “The council’s finances are dire and the Tories are penalising responsible householders. We should be encouraging recycling not taxing it. The Tories will be making a profit of £13 on every green bin. This a profit margin of 30%.

Jeremy Hilton (LD: Kingsholm and Wotton) who called for financial regulations to be tightened said:\n“There has been a seemingly lack of financial propriety in that substantial sums of money have been moved around in this council’s reserves in order for the Conservative Cabinet to award Urbaser Balfour Beatty a further £17million for the waste incinerator project at Javelin Park that no one apart from them actually wants.\n“The minority Conservative administration seems to have forgotten that we are a Council in no overall control. They must consult with all parties when making changes to the agreed budget.\n“I was a Cabinet Member from 2001-2005 and I had to seek council’s approval to be awarded less than £1million for the Tri-Service workshop project.\n“Awarding large sums of tax-payers money ‘by a nod and a wink’ is unacceptable and changes need to be made to stop this from happening again in the future. I’m concerned that new projects have been deleted and on-going projects will now no longer happen, because of the awarding this extra £17m to UBB.\n“I’m pleased that this will be looked at by the council’s Constitution Committee of which I am a member. I hope to see vital changes to our constitution reported back to full council at the earliest opportunity in the new year.”\nLiberal Democrat Deputy Group Leader, Cllr. Iain Dobie (LD: Leckhampton and Warden Hill) who supported calls for such changes to take place also said that:\n“I was told, with authority, that an overspend of 1% of budget would be defined as a scrutiny-worthy “significant overspend” – Here, we are considering as exceptional shift of £17million, which is 4% of the county’s overall budget of this year. This is a highly significant budgetary reallocation.\n“Early this year the budget for this council was brought for a vote by all councillors. So, surely, any such administration which plans, late in the financial year, to significantly shift county spending is a matter for all members of this council to approve.\n“I believe that democracy is undermined if cabinet members are allowed to shift significant sums as they please without respecting what was voted on by all county councillors in the budget debate. If the precedent of £17 million is allowed to stand unchallenged this time then why not £70 million next time?”\nThe issue will be discussed at the next Constitution Committee meeting on Friday 8th January at 10am.",

However, the art panels should be displayed and illuminated to show them off in the best way possible.

Sebastian Field worked exceptionally hard to secure this win.\n“The two wins now mean that the Conservatives have 21 seats and the Liberal Democrats and Labour both have nine councillors each.\nOn the 24th of April the county\ncouncil cabinet, which is controlled by the Conservatives, agreed a plan to\nconvert Trevone House into a resource centre for young people between ages of\n16 and 20.\nTrevone House will provide living\naccommodation for up to 21 young people who are in the care of the county\ncouncil. The facility will have staff on duty 24/7.\nThe young persons’ facility will\nhave a health assessment unit, an educational day service and apartments for\nyoung people to be able to learn the skills of daily living to prepare them for\nadulthood. It will be inspected by Ofsted and the Care Quality Commission.\nThe county council held a public\nconsultation on the 15th of May and another is planned during August.\nHere are the set of questions from Jeremy Hilton that took place at cabinet on the 24th of April. First set is the written questions and answers. The second set are the verbal supplementary questions and answers.\nThe report\nsays the proposed remodelling of Trevone House will provide a resource centre\nfor children and young people, provision of a health assessment unit, an\neducational day service and apartments for young people to be able to learn the\nskills of daily living to prepare them for adulthood. I agree that such a\nfacility for young people in care is required in Gloucestershire, but what\nother properties in the county were considered and where are they located?\nAnswer 1 –\nRichard Boyles\nChildren\nServices over the past few years have considered a number of options in\nrelation to providing provision of placements for children and young people in\ncounty. This has included looking at existing buildings, as well as purchasing\nnew provision, both in urban and more rural areas. Unfortunately, these\nsearches did not identify any potential properties with the scope that is being\noffered from using Trevone House. This project is innovative in its design,\noffering a multi agency approach to our young people. Because of this, it needs\nto be centrally located, accessible both for young people to access community\nresources, but also for staff and partners.\nQuestion 2\n– Jeremy Hilton\nI was only\nbriefed about this proposal on the 11th of April 2019, the day before the\ncabinet report was published. Local residents haven’t been consulted. What\nplans do you have to fully consult local residents, other care institutions and\nlocal schools based in Kingsholm? And will they be listened to?\nAnswer 2 –\nRichard Boyles\nA\ncommunications plan will be implemented, to engage with and listen to local\nresidents, so that everyone has an opportunity to share their views. Our young\nambassadors will be part of this process, bringing to life their journeys,\nworking together not only for the development of this project but also for the\nlife time of the provision, to reduce anxiety, mitigate risks and promote\ncommunity cohesion.\nQuestion 3\n– Jeremy Hilton\nIn paragraph\n3.2, the report says that this proposal will provide accommodation for 16-20\nyear olds. Can you provide me with an assurance that no person will be placed\nat Trevone House who is over the age of 20 years?\nAnswer 3 –\nRichard Boyles\nThis project\nis to support young people moving onto independence from the age of 16 years,\nplanning for them to move on to independent accommodation. In exceptional\ncircumstances, where young people need more time or support due to their\nlearning or emotional needs, consideration would be given for them to remain in\nplacement post 20 years. These young people would have a robust transition plan\nin place.\nQuestion 4\n– Jeremy Hilton\nWill the new\nyoung persons facility at Trevone House be a single gender provision? If not,\nwhat spilt in genders is expected?\nAnswer 4 –\nRichard Boyles\nThe\naccommodation will be co-ed, but this will be in the context of a needs lead\nservice and planned placements. Placement matching is key to the success of\nthis project and a panel will be in place to review placement referrals. This\nwill be multi agency, with colleagues from Health, Police, Children’s Services\nand the provider. The panel will not only review the placement referrals, it\nwill also monitor the young people in placement.\nQuestion 5\n– Jeremy Hilton\nOn Radio\nGloucestershire, (8am on 15th April 2019), Cllr Mark Hawthorne stated that\nthere would be a minimum of 4 members staff on duty 24/7. Is this correct and\nhow many staff will be on duty during the day and over the night?\nAnswer 5 –\nRichard Boyles\nThe whole\nconcept of this project is to support and enable our young people to flourish\nand be aspirational in developing their plans for adulthood. Therefore,\nstaffing is critical, not only in the numbers but the quality and skills of the\nstaff team. There will be a minimum of four staff on duty at any one time, across\nthe whole project. At times, where needed, there will be more staff on duty for\nthose young people who need higher levels of support. Parts of the tendering\nprocess will require potential providers to evidence their staffs skills and\ntraining and supervision standards to ensure they meet the requirements of this.\nGiven the nature of the project, there will be additional staff during the day\nto deliver the day service provision. The project will also have capacity to\nbring in additional staff as required and to support young people in distress,\nparticularly those in need of health assessments\nThe\nfollowing supplementary questions were asked at the meeting\nSupplementary\nQuestion 1 – Jeremy Hilton\nCllr Hilton\nreferred to the large number of care institutions based in Kingsholm and stated\nhow important it was not to overload the community with such facilities.\nSeeking clarification on the answer to his question, Cllr Hilton asked what\nother properties in the county had been considered as possible locations for a\nyoung person’s facility? Cllr Hilton asked Cllr Boyles to provide a written\nanswer to the question, including the reasons why the locations had been\ndismissed as suitable premises.\nResponse\nby: Cllr Richard Boyles (Cabinet Member for Children and Young People)\nCllr Boyles\nexplained that the project to provide a young person’s facility as was proposed\nfour years ago under the IRIS project. After the Ofsted Inspection in 2017, a\nkey part of Gloucestershire’s Sufficiency Strategy expanded the need for a\nwider range of local accommodation options. Cllr Boyles explained that some of\nthe properties that had originally been considered were no longer suitable .\nThe Gloucestershire Sufficiency Strategy aimed to cater for young people in the\ncommunity. Cllr Boyles agreed to provide Cllr Hilton with a written response to\nhis question after the meeting. He stated that, as the terms of the project\ngrew, so did the terms of requirement.\nSupplementary\nQuestion 2 – Jeremy Hilton\nCllr Hilton\nacknowledged there was a communications plan but stressed the importance of\nconsulting with the local community. Cllr Hilton asked for assurance that\nconsultation had been done?\nResponse\nby: Cllr Richard Boyles\nCllr Boyles\nreferred to the clear communications plan which set out the engagements that\nwould be undertaken with the local community on a wide range of issues\nassociated with the project, including bus services, schools and hospitals.\nCllr Boyles agreed to provide a written response to the question after the\nmeeting and assured Cllr Hilton the views of the local community would be\nlistened to.\nSupplementary\nQuestion 3 – Jeremy Hilton\nCllr Hilton\nstated that, in the UK, a person reached maturity and was regarded as an adult\nby the time of their 18th birthday. Cllr Hilton asked Cllr Boyles to guarantee\nno new person over the age of 20 would be placed at Trevone House and that no\none over age 20 would spend their first night in care at the house?\nResponse\nby: Cllr Richard Boyles\nCllr Boyles\nstated he was unable to promise that no one over the age of 20 would be placed\nat Trevone House. He explained some placements could roll over beyond the age\nof 18 and that he would need to consult with the team on the matter. Cllr\nBoyles did not envisage anyone over the age of 20 would be placed at the\nfacility but could not give a definite yes or no at this time.\nSupplementary\nQuestion 4 – Jeremy Hilton\nCllr Hilton\nnoted that the Care Quality Commission and Ofsted were regulators of the\nfacility and asked how often and how rigorous were their inspections expected\nto be?\nResponse\nby: Cllr Richard Boyles\nCllr Boyles\nconfirmed the inspections would be as rigorous as always and that the\ninspection reports would be available as and when the information was provided.\nThe inspections would be annual but may be more frequent.\nSupplementary\nQuestion 5 – Jeremy Hilton\nCllr Hilton\nreferred to a recent briefing with Cllr Boyles and the indication there would\nonly be two people on duty overnight. Cllr Hilton also referred to a recent\nradio interview given by the Leader of the Council, Cllr Mark Hawthorne, where\nit was suggested there would be 4 members of staff on duty 24/7. Cllr Hilton\nsought clarification on how many members of staff would be on duty at the\nfacility from 9pm to 9am?\nResponse\nby: Cllr Richard Boyles\nCllr Boyles\nconfirmed there would be 4 members of staff on duty, once the facility was\nfully open. Until this time, and as the facility developed, the number of staff\ncould be lower, dependent on the number of residents. Cllr Boyles said that\neverything would be risk assessed, with additional staff brought in if the risk\nwas deemed appropriate.\nThe Liberal Democrats are demanding Network Rail delivers on a commitment for hourly direct rail services to London from Gloucester.\nHourly direct services to Paddington were due to start in December 2018 but have been delayed until December 2019 at the earliest.\nCouncillor Jeremy Hilton, leader of Gloucester Liberal Democrats, is calling on Network Rail to deliver the hourly service as part of the forthcoming May 2019 timetable changes for the Great Western mainline.\n“Hourly direct services to London from Gloucester and Cheltenham would be a real economic boost to Gloucestershire and may even encourage businesses to consider moving to the county,” Councillor Hilton said.\n“They would also improve links to the capital for Gloucester’s residents.\n“I understand train operator Great Western Railways is keen to run the services and I would urge Network Rail to bring forward the timetable changes to this May.”\nIt is understood Network Rail has delayed implementing the hourly service due to problems with the timetable changes introduced last year, particularly on the Northern and Thameslink networks.\nNetwork Rail has written to Gloucestershire County Council to inform them that from May there will be a new weekday 9.19am service from Cheltenham to Paddington with a weekday 4.36pm service in the return direction.\nCouncillor Hilton added: “Already, there has been major investment in dual tracking the railway line between Kemble and Swindon. GWR has also invested in new rolling stock.\n“The additional daytime service that is being launched from May is a welcome improvement but we want to see the hourly services that were due to start last year introduced.”\nGround work to improve Wellington Parade Garden on London Road has been delayed. The city council had planned to start construction this month and follow on with the planting of shrubs and plants in April.\nBut, Lib Dem councillors Jeremy Hilton and Isabel Brazil have been told that tenders haven’t even been issued for the work. Tenders have been delayed by the city council’s legal services team.\nCurrently, the garden is closed because it has become a location of problem street drinking. Adults have been drinking alcohol to excess, fighting and arguing between themselves, and using local residents’ front gardens as a toilet. The new garden layout has been designed to be more attractive and to discourage street drinking.\nCllr. Jeremy Hilton (Lib Dem – Kingsholm & Wotton) said: “The delay in construction of the new garden is disappointing, but this is becoming normal with projects run by Gloucester City Council. With so many jobs lost under the Tories’ austerity plan, there are not enough staff to process projects on time. This really is a ‘Vanishing Council’.\n“Isabel Brazil and I have worked hard to get an agreement for improvements to this problem garden. We secured funding to enable works to be done, but to be told last week that it is being delayed by the legal services team, is ridiculous. This is not a big project, but the red tape being applied may cost more than the budget for the actual ground work.”\nCllr. Isabel Brazil (Lib Dem – Kingsholm & Wotton) said: “A new Public Space Protection Order banning the drinking of alcohol in public spaces along London Road recently came into force. The second stage of our action plan is a new layout for the garden that should discourage street drinking. The city council needs to get on with this project.”\nGloucestershire County Council is about to embark on a countywide review of residents’ permit parking zones. It is expected that this will start on 1st of April. We have been assured that Kingsholm will be considered early in the review.\nThe county council will consider the current parking zone areas to see if amendments are required.\nThe following streets will also be considered as potential areas to be included in the residents parking permits scheme.\nArea 1 – North end of Deans Way, Sandhurst Road, Edwy Parade, & Kingsholm Square\nArea 2 – Hinton Road, Malvern Road, North Road & Seabroke Road\nArea 3 – Sebert Street, Oxford Road, Henry Road, Henry Street & Honyatt Road – plus parts of Heathville Road and Denmark Road.\nJeremy Hilton said: “Both Isabel Brazil and I have received a number of requests for residents parking zones to be introduced in Kingsholm. I am disappointed that a review should take place at same time as the permit fees are due to go up. However, there is serious commuter congestion in some streets that can only be resolved with a residents’ permit scheme.”\nIsabel Brazil said: “Changes to the permit zones will only go ahead if supported by a majority of residents living in the area. The county council will fully consult.”\nJeremy Hilton fighting to save the Civil Service Sports Ground\nJeremy Hilton has written to the city council development control team to raise objections to their recommendation to approve Redrow’s planning application 18/00306/FUL to build 100 houses on the former Civil Service Club Sports Ground.\nCllr. Hilton believes this to be inconsistent with the planning committee’s decision on the 4th December when it rejected the application for 89 properties on the same site. The planning committee are meeting on Tuesday the 8th of January at 6pm to determine the application for 100 houses.\nRedrow’s plan for 100 houses on former sports fields, in heart of Kingsholm\nJeremy Hilton has listed ten reasons why the application should be rejected. Here are his objections in full.\nA. Housing Types:\nThe development meets the 20% affordable homes target, with appropriate mix of housing types, but it does not meet the requirement for market housing mix, with no provision for one or two bedroom homes. Kingsholm & Wotton has a good mix of housing and so should any new development in the ward. The applicant proposes 31 three bedroom houses and 49 four bedroom houses. The mix according to SHMA should be 9 one bedroom homes, 23 two bedroom homes, 30 three bedroom homes and 18 four bedroom homes. Rejection on this policy alone would be consistent with the committee decision on the 89 house application.\nB. Land Purchase:\nThe applicants purchased the sports ground from the Civil Service Sports Council Ltd for just £10,000 in 2011 (GR355501). The applicants should publicly declare the details of the uplift clause they have with Civil Service Sports Council Ltd.\nI believe it is this legal agreement that is responsible for the maximisation of housing on the site rather than what one would expect in open discussion with the council and community on a development brief that would benefit all. Some degree of housing whilst retaining the main sports field for sport and recreation, would benefit everyone.\nC. Alternative sport provision:\nIt may be that the land has not been used for sport for more than five years, but that is because of a deliberate policy by the landowners to close the ground for sporting activities.\nI am disappointed that Sport England have changed their objection to the development. I don’t think a cash gift from Redrow of £2m to the city council to be spent elsewhere in Gloucester on sports provision adequately compensates for the loss of the playing fields that are in the heart of Kingsholm.\nThe applicant has been unable to identify alternative provision elsewhere in Kingsholm & Wotton and therefore some sports provision should be retained on site. Spartans Rugby Club that is based in Sherborne Street would support the provision here for an additional rugby pitch for the club to use.\nD. Joint Core Strategy INF3\nThe proposed development of 100 dwellings in my opinion is not consistent with JCS policy on green infrastructure. The former Civil Service Sport Ground provides a worthy green infrastructure asset that should be protected to help resolve the shortage of open space in Kingsholm and Wotton.\nI believe it is not beyond the wit of Redrow Homes to come up with a development solution that would provide much needed housing whilst retaining a large open space that could continue to be used for sport and recreation.\nThe impact on the biodiversity from the wholesale building on the site will be negative. Two badger sets as indicated in the report will disappear if the development proceeds. Trees will be felled. The report also states that the development will create the loss of a foraging area for bats.\nThe proposed tiny public open space is tucked away in the corner of the site giving the impression that it is an exclusive space for residents of the estate rather than one that is inclusive for everyone living in Kingsholm to use. A large percentage of the public open space is set out as a flood attenuation basin, making the space practicably unusable for recreational purposes.\nHere is Policy INF3\nThe green infrastructure network of local and strategic importance will be conserved and enhanced, in order to deliver a series of multifunctional, linked green corridors across the JCS area by: i. Improving the quantity and/or quality of assets; ii. Improving linkages between assets in a manner appropriate to the scale of development, and iii. Designing improvements in a way that supports the cohesive management of green infrastructure;\nDevelopment proposals should consider and contribute positively towards green infrastructure, including the wider landscape context and strategic corridors between major assets and populations. Where new residential development will create, or add to, a need for publicly accessible green space or outdoor space for sports and recreational on, this will be fully met in accordance with Policy INF4. Development at Strategic Allocations will be required to deliver connectivity through the site, linking urban areas with the wider rural hinterland\nExisting green infrastructure will be protected in a manner that reflects its contribution to ecosystem services (including biodiversity, landscape/townscape quality, the historic environment, public access, recreation and play) and the connectivity of the green infrastructure network. Development proposals that will have an impact on woodlands, hedges and trees will need to include a justification for why this impact cannot be avoided and should incorporate measures acceptable to the Local Planning Authority to mitigate the loss. Mitigation should be provided on-site or, where this is not possible, in the immediate environs of the site\nWhere assets are created, retained or replaced within a scheme, they should be properly integrated into the design and contribute to local character and distinctiveness. Proposals should also make provisions for future maintenance of green infrastructure.\nE. Joint Core Strategy INF4\nThe lack of serious community engagement by Redrow ahead of this planning application, about the future use of the site, is lamentable. They locked the gates and closed down the sporting use, even though it was a well used facility.\nRedrow have only presented plans that have proposed the complete building on the site, with the total loss of the playing fields. They have never properly consulted with anyone who lives in Kingsholm.\nThe proposal for provide £148,784.31 towards the Sebert Street Recreation Ground play area has NOT been discussed with the community. This is currently one of the best play areas in the city that was created by the parents of Kingsholm Kids at Play. I am concerned about possible overdevelopment of the Sebert Street Recreational Ground as proposed in the officer’s report. What about Deans Way Meadow? Why is there no onsite provision?\nThere is no clarity in the officer recommendations on what the Section 106 financial agreement will be and what positive impact these will have on the local community.\nI believe Redrow have failed to meet the requirement of Joint Core Strategy policy INF4 for social and community infrastructure\nHere is Policy INF4\nProposals to develop land or buildings currently or previously in use as a community facility will demonstrate, including evidence of engagement with relevant local community groups and partner organisations, why the facility is no longer required and, as appropriate, how, when and where suitable local replacement facilities will be provided. Provision of replacement facilities will have regard to the locational and other relevant elements of this policy\nWhere new residential development will create, or add to, a need for community facilities, it will be fully met as on-site provision and/or as a contribution to facilities or services onsite. New or refurbished provision will be of an appropriate type, standard and size. From an early stage, developers will be expected to engage with the relevant local authorities and infrastructure providers and, as appropriate, relevant local community groups where they exist, to ensure that new provision meets the needs of the community that it will serve and is t for purpose\nSocial and community infrastructure should be centrally located to the population it serves and be easily accessible on foot and by bicycle. It should be located so as to have the potential to be well-served by public transport. Developers should aim to provide flexible, multifunctional facilities within mixed-use developments, creating shared space which maximises benefits to the community and minimises land-take. In the case of open space, ‘easily accessible’ means it is located within reasonable walking distance of the development it serves. New facilities should be accessible to all members of the community, and be planned and phased in parallel with new development.\nF. Joint Core Strategy INF6\nThis development, as did the one for 89 houses, fails to meet the requirement of this policy. The site will increase carbon emissions rather than reduce them with large increase of vehicles into the area around Denmark Road. It will reduce the opportunity to improve the health of local people in the area by reducing the local opportunity for sport and recreation for residents of Kingsholm.\nKingsholm Primary School, which is a vibrant and popular school has expressed concern about their ability to cope with the additional children going to the school and the possible detriment to children from traveller families, who may no longer be able to get it.\nHere is Policy INF6\nWhere infrastructure requirements are generated as a result of individual site proposals and / or having regard to cumulative impact, new development will be served and supported by adequate and appropriate on- and / or off-site infrastructure and services. In identifying infrastructure requirements, development proposals will also demonstrate that full regard has been given, where appropriate, to implementing the requirements of the Joint Core Strategy Infrastructure Delivery Plan\nWhere need for additional infrastructure and services and / or impacts on existing infrastructure and services is expected to arise, the Local Planning Authority will seek to secure appropriate infrastructure which is necessary, directly related, and fairly and reasonably related to the scale and kind of the development proposal, including:\nBroadband infrastructure\nClimate change mitigation/adaptation;\nCommunity and cultural facilities and initiatives;\nEarly Years and Education;\nHealth and well-being facilities and sport, recreation and leisure facilities;\nThe highway network, traffic management, sustainable transport and disabled people’s access;\nProtection of cultural and heritage assets and the potential for their enhancement;\nProtection of environmental assets and the potential for their enhancement;\nProvision of Green Infrastructure including open space;\nPublic realm;\nSafety and security including emergency services.\n3. Priority for provision will be assessed both on a site-by-site basis and having regard to the mitigation of cumulative impact, together with implementation of the JCS Infrastructure Delivery Plan\n4. Planning permission will be granted only where sufficient provision has been made for infrastructure and services (together with their continued maintenance) to meet the needs of new development and / or which are required to mitigate the impact of new development upon existing communities. Infrastructure and services must be provided in line with an agreed, phased timescale and in accordance with other requirements of this Plan.\nG. Draft City Plan Policy SA06\nThe provision of 100 dwellings is in my opinion is overdevelopment of the site, which is in the heart of Kingsholm. Council policy as identified in the draft City Plan, which was approved by council in December 2016, recommends a maximum of 20 dwellings (SA06).\nThe proposal of 100 dwellings exceeds this policy by 500%, with the complete loss of the playing fields.\nA compromise of 40 dwellings, for example, on this site would mean that the former sports field could be brought back into use\nH. Layout of the site:\nThe layout of the site does not follow the usual street pattern that is evident in Kingsholm. It is adjacent to both the Kingsholm and Denmark Road conservation areas.\nI am concerned that the narrow streets on estate may become clogged up with motorists parking their cars on footpaths. This is a problem that will be exacerbated during times when there are rugby matches being played at the Kingsholm stadium.\nIf 89 houses was an overdevelopment of the site as mentioned in the minutes of the December meeting then surely 100 houses is more so. There is still concern about the closeness of houses next to Bijou Court. There are a few areas where the relationships are below 21 metres separation, a concern raised by the planning officer.\nI. Highway access:\nThe proposed access onto Denmark Road is unacceptable. It closes the slip road to Lansdown Road and removes much-needed parking spaces on Denmark Road.\nThe closure of the slip road will create more vehicle conflict at the other junction with Lansdown Road. This will be a particular problem when school coaches use this junction. Parents often park illegally on double yellow lines at this point. The problem will become much worse.\nThe closure of the slip road will also remove the U-turn provision it provides for the houses serviced off the dual carriageway section of Denmark Road on the south side.\nJ. Public open space:\nKingsholm & Wotton has a low level of public open space as identified in the city council’s open spaces strategy. The officer report confirms this to be the case. The council’s public open space standard is 2.8ha per 1000 population.\nBased on the new ward boundaries introduced at the 2016 election the ward has just 0.49ha per 1,000 population. Or 3.59ha for a population based on mid 2016 of 7,259 persons.\nAn opportunity is being missed in the proposed development to achieve a good increase in public open space provision in the ward because of the wholesale development of the site.\nIsabel Brazil & Jeremy Hilton on Sandhurst Lane near to the traffic survey point\nSpeeding motorists travelling on along Sandhurst Lane in Kingsholm and Wotton are a menace say local Lib Dem councillors, Jeremy Hilton and Isabel Brazil.\nA survey carried out between the 16th and 22nd July by Gloucestershire County Council found that 80% of southbound motorists were speeding as they approached St. Oswald’s Road.\nThe survey was requested by county councillor Jeremy Hilton. It was taken at the midway point between Rivermead Close and Greville Close along the built-up section of Sandhurst Lane.\nCllr. Jeremy Hilton said: “The results confirm what many of us already knew that far too many motorists are speeding along Sandhurst Lane. They are breaking the 30mph speed limit and risking the lives of pedestrians walking on the narrow footways.\n“There is a clear road safety issue here that the county council must resolve. I have asked the county traffic manager to propose a solution that will help reduce traffic speeds to below the 30mph limit.\n“Even though the results suggest northbound vehicles are not breaking the limit have seen motorists accelerate aggressively as they pass by Rivermead Close.”\nCllr. Isabel Brazil agreed and said: “Speeding vehicles are a menace, particularly on a lane with narrow or non-existent footways. The county council must do something.”\nOver the seven days of the survey the volume of traffic averaged out at 2,047 vehicles per day.\nSouthbound survey results\nThe survey found that 80% of southbound drivers were travelling at a speed greater than the 30mph limit. The average speed was 39mph with 85% of vehicles travelling at speeds of 47mph or less.\nNorthbound survey results\nOnly 2.5% of northbound vehicles were travelling above the 30mph speed limit. The northbound, traffic kept within the speed limits with an average speed of 21mph and with 85% of vehicles travelling at speeds of 25mph or less.\nClosed by the Tories. Jeremy Hilton outside former Bishop’s College. A lost opportunity to build new comprehensive school here.\nJeremy Hilton has reiterated calls for a new secondary school to be built in the north of the city.\nIt comes after forecasts prepared by the Department for Education reveal a shortfall of 477 secondary school places in Gloucester by 2023/24.\nAcross the country 130,000 children are at risk of missing out on a secondary school place over the next five years, according to the Local Government Association.\nRising birth rates and the thousands of new homes built at Kingsway and Cooper’s Edge has seen increasing pressure for primary school places in Gloucester.\nBut with thousands of new homes planned on the outskirts of Gloucester – at Innsworth, Churchdown and Brockworth as part of the Joint Core Strategy – there will be further demand on school places.\nGloucester Liberal Democrats have long argued there was a need for a new non-selective secondary school in the north of the city as children not attending either Sir Thomas Rich’s or Denmark Road High School for Girls, having to travel to Churchdown, Brockworth, Tewkesbury, Newent, the south of Gloucester or further afield.\nJeremy Hilton said the school should have been built on the former Bishop’s College site in Longlevens but housing is now being built there instead.\nWhen Jeremy and Gloucester Lib Dems first called for a new comprehensive secondary school in the north of Gloucester the then Conservative county council cabinet member for children and young people dismissed it as a “pre-election stunt”.\nBut the need for a new secondary school in Gloucester has now been supported by a report prepared by the county council.\nThe Gloucester City School Places Review said the need for extra primary school places would be met by expanding existing schools and agreements with housing developers to build additional schools.\nBut with secondary schools the review states that there is a “significant shortfall of places from 2022” and a new site for a secondary school in Gloucester should be found.\nThe report also says that existing secondary schools should be expanded where possible.\nCouncillor Jeremy Hilton, said:\n“When we first questioned which secondary schools the children living in all the new family homes being built on the outskirts of Gloucester would go to, the Tories just dismissed our concern.\n“With so many houses planned because of the Joint Core Strategy it was obvious there was going to be further pressure on primary and secondary school places in Gloucester.\n“The Department for Education’s own forecasts support this, and the county council has now realised what we have been saying all along about the need for a new comprehensive secondary school.\n”It is vital that this school is non-selective. A genuine, high performing comprehensive school. There is no need for any further grammar school places. The grammars are already taking far too many pupils that live outside the city and even outside Gloucestershire. The new comprehensive school must be built to serve those that live in the north of Gloucester.”",

I intend to vote yes again on Thursday with a positive vote to REMAIN in the European Union. A union of 28 countries working together peacefully to sort out issues of cross border importance, such as trade, the environment and security.\nMy primary reason in voting yes in 1975 was to make sure that European countries sorted out their differences around a table and not on a battlefield. I wanted to live my life in peace. I have never regretted my decision. I have seen the Common Market of nine countries grow into the European Union of twenty-eight.\nIn 1975 the continent was split between western democracies and socialist dictatorships. Spain, Greece & Portugal were becoming democracies and joined the EU in the early 1980s. Now the EU has a population of 508 million living in peace with each other and with governments co-operating over issues that affect us all. As Winston Churchill said “Jaw Jaw is better than War War”.\nI have been concerned about the whole tone of the referendum campaign, particularly when I listen to those arguing to leave. I also think to myself; ‘I want my country back’. But, what I certainly don’t want is the UK run by a right wing clique of people who feed on people’s fears and concerns. Who stir up xenophobia and blame others for our problems.\nI grew up in a country that was proud of itself and was an open and free society, working with other nations within international organisations such as the UN, NATO, the Commonwealth and the EU. I believe that if we leave the EU it will be a step backwards. We could see our country fall apart with Scotland leaving the UK and “Little England” left just floating in the mid-Atlantic with few friends.\nAs individuals we would lose our right to live and work anywhere in the EU. Our European Health Insurance Card will become invalid. Many of us will suffer from loss of work or earnings. Taxes may rise. We shall probably experience years of regret that we isolated ourselves from our friends on the continent.\nI also want to address the nonsense espoused by leave campaigners that the EU is undemocratic, this is untrue. Every five years we elect MEP’s to represent us in the European Parliament, which amends and approves legalisation that the Council of Ministers’ support. The Council of Ministers includes an elected representative from every government. The European Commission acts in a similar way to our very own Civil Service.\nI hope that everyone will think very carefully about the way they are going to vote on Thursday. This is not the time to bash the Tory government, we can do that at the ballot box at the next general election. This is a time to vote for our children’s future. In my view it will be much better for them if we remain in the EU.",

Jeremy Hilton (Kingsholm & Wotton) said:\n“Freezing car-parking charges was one of our top six manifesto pledges. The county council earns a profit of more than £1.5 million from on-street car parking charges. It can well afford to freeze charges for the next four years.\n“In Gloucestershire 3,400 residents’ parking permits are issued each year. The annual fee for a permit is £80. This has risen from £62 in 2010. Liberal Democrats believe the charge is too much and want to see the fee dropped to £50 per year. In a survey done in my own division of Kingsholm & Wotton in Gloucester 80% of residents said the cost of a permit should be £50 or less.”\nKlara Sudbury (Charlton Park & College) who will second the motion said:\n“The cost of parking on the streets in Cheltenham is far too high. It is time the county council stopped treating our streets like a cash cow. Reducing the fee for residents parking permits from £80 to £50 will help many hard pressed families who live in the centre of Cheltenham.”\nEnds…",

This means there are 3.5 million smaller private rental homes which legally do not have to have them. The Government passed a law in 2013 which would require all private landlords to provide smoke alarms. However, this has gone out to consultation and has not yet been brought into force.\nFire and Rescue Authorities in England and Wales are calling for the law to be enacted so all private landlords are obliged to install them. They also want electrical wiring to be inspected annually – in the same way landlords are obliged to obtain gas safety certificates every year.\nThe call comes as latest figures show more than 200 people die in fires in their homes every year. (This figure covers both rental and owner occupier properties.) Householders are at least four times more likely to die in a fire if they do not have a working smoke alarm.\nFire and Rescue Authorities are taking a lead by giving out free alarms and launching safety awareness campaigns. However, given the tough austerity climate, they argue it must be down to private landlords to ensure alarms are installed.\nMandatory smoke alarms is set to be a key issue at the LGA’s annual fire conference in Gateshead, from March 10-11th. The call forms a central part of the LGA’s key report ‘The Fire and Rescue Service: Making our Nation Safer’, which is being launched today (Saturday). This document sets out a blueprint for the next government, with a series of proposals for how fire and rescue services can improve fire safety and save the public purse money.\nCllr Jeremy Hilton, Chair of the LGA’s Fire Services Management Committee, said:\n“Many people will be shocked that most landlords are not obliged to install smoke alarms. The current laws are outdated and inadequate – and without question lives are being put at risk.\n“While the majority of private landlords are reputable and voluntarily install alarms, there are a small minority who don’t, needlessly putting lives at risk. They have a duty of care to ensure their tenants are safe.\n“This is why we are calling on the Government to enact the law and ensure all private landlords install smoke alarms – and save hundreds of lives every year.\n“A working smoke alarm can make the difference between life and death and should be seen as every bit as essential as a lock on the front door. By spending just a few pounds, landlords can save lives.\n“In the meantime, we would urge anyone who hasn’t got one fitted already to make sure they are not needlessly putting themselves at risk of the death and destruction fire can cause by getting in touch with their local fire & rescue service requesting a home safety check.”\nMark Cashin, Deputy Chief Fire Officer of Cheshire and Chair of the Chief Fire Officers Association’s Home Safety Committee, said:\n“While death and injuries from fires have reduced considerably in recent years, the majority of victims continue to be those who are most vulnerable, often living in private rented accommodation.\n“This change would improve the safety of families and stop dozens of people from losing their lives to fire each year. The cost to landlords is small, with a ten year sealed alarm costing around £15.”",

Liberal Democrats had long called for a plan B, when it was obvious the original scheme was going nowhere. I welcome the new plan drawn up by the council’s consultants, which will be a genuine mixed use scheme.\nI am pleased that we shall retain Kings Square as a public open space and that it will not be built on as was the case in the original retail led scheme. However, there is still a lot of design work to do in making sure that the refurbished square is something we can all be proud of and enjoy.\nIt is critical that we get the layout of the development and the quality of the architecture right so that the development becomes an impressive gateway into the city centre from both the railway station and bus station. There will also be a new car park with 428 spaces and I hope the designers ensure that it will be a safe and pleasant place to use. The proposed hotel should also be of the quality that will boost Gloucester’s offer and attract people back to the city.\nKings Quarter should also be the location of a modern and good quality indoor market to replace the tired market at the Eastgate Shopping Centre. Markets need a good footfall and the development at Kings Quarter should provide a location near to the transport hubs for specialist market traders to thrive.\nIt will be important that the development is a high quality build and of a design that wins architectural awards. I believe the consultants have got it right in proposing four phases of the development. The inclusion of residential units in the plans must also be welcomed.\nFinally, I do think the city council cabinet has missed a golden opportunity to move its offices to the King’s Quarter. The cabinet is considering selling the offices at Herbert, Kimberly and Phillpotts warehouses and moving into Shire Hall. I think we should seriously consider building new council offices in the King’s Quarter, helping to kickstart the regeneration of this area just as we did in the 1980’s when we moved our offices to the Docks. The business plan does include up to 100,000 sq feet of office space.",

The official launch of their full Manifesto will take place early next week.\nThe top six priorities that the Liberal Democrats have coined ‘six-to-fix’ are listed as follows:\n1. Repairing our roads, filling in potholes\n2. Growing our economy, investing in jobs\n3. Opposing a waste incinerator, protecting the environment\n4. Freezing on-street parking charges, cutting the price of residents’ parking permits\n5. Making sure we can trust what we eat, protecting trading standards\n6.

Jeremy Hilton said:\n“Our ‘six-to-fix’ priorities will benefit all those who live and work in Gloucestershire not just a select few. These top priorities along with our other plans included in the manifesto have been brought together by listening to the people of this county.\n“We believe that more can be done to improve the quality of services provided by Gloucestershire County Council. Our manifesto to be launched on Monday is a plan that will help people across the county understand who we are, what we represent and what is important.\n“This manifesto spells out our county policies taking us up to the County Elections and beyond.

Repairing our roads, filling in potholes\nLiberal Democrats will invest in additional repairs to our roads and footways to repair the damage left after eight years of Tory neglect. We will release £5 million worth of surplus funds in the council’s reserves to help fix the enormous number of potholes on the county’s roads.\n2. Growing our economy, investing in jobs\nThe county council will work with the Local Enterprise Partnership to create more private sector jobs and apprenticeships. Liberal Democrats will support growing businesses to achieve their goals and will also work to establish new businesses in manufacturing, advanced technologies and the green economy.\n3. Opposing a waste incinerator, protecting the environment\nWe have strongly opposed the building of a £500m waste incinerator at Javelin Park on environmental and economic grounds. We will seek to use more environmentally friendly technology to dispose of the residual household waste.\n4. Freezing on-street parking charges, cutting the price of residents’ parking permits\nA Liberal Democrat council will freeze on-street car parking charges across Gloucestershire. In residents’ parking permit zones Liberal Democrats will reduce the annual fee from £80 to £50.\n5. Making sure we can trust what we eat, protecting trading standards\nThe Tories have slashed spending on Trading Standards by 50% at a time when the service is under greatly increased pressure with the controversy over horse meat in beef products. It needs to be in the forefront of testing food products on sale locally. There will be no further cuts in Trading Standards under the Liberal Democrats.\n6.

The latest excuse was provided by the Conservative cabinet member in a written answer to a question from Lib Dem councillor for Kingsholm, Cllr. Jeremy Hilton.\nThe survey is planned so that the council can provide definitive evidence that too many family homes in Kingsholm are being converted into Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMO).\nA 130-signature petition was handed into the cabinet by Jeremy Hilton in November 2020.\nThe Petition said:\n“Too many family homes in Kingsholm are being converted into Houses in Multiple Occupation, without planning permission being required. It is currently permitted development for six persons or less.\nI/We the undersigned demand that the city council starts work immediately on preparing evidence and documentation to apply to the Secretary of State to give Kingsholm the protection of an Article 4 Direction. This means that all conversions of family homes into Houses in Multiple Occupation would require planning permission.”\nCllr. Jeremy Hilton said:\n“Lib Dems tried to amend the council plan in July 2020 to get the work started on a housing stock survey, but the Conservatives voted it down.\n“That is why I raised an online petition to get public support. I handed it in at the November 2020 cabinet.\n“Shortly afterwards, I met officers who suggested we schedule the survey work for April this year. Then it was delayed until the summer to be part of a countywide housing survey.\n“Now the Cabinet Member for Planning and Housing Strategy says there have been delays because of legal queries and the tender documents haven’t been issued. It is ridiculous, the word incompetence comes to mind.\nThe written question and the answer published in the council papers of the 23rd of September 2021\n“Kingsholm residents are frustrated by the Conservative council’s reluctance to treat Kingsholm as a special case. We see the onward creep of Houses in Multiple Occupation and the damage done to the community. Parking, noise and litter all contribute to the degradation of our once-quiet streets.”\nJeremy Hilton concluded:\n“It is very frustrating trying to get projects implemented at the city council. We are given dates, then later dates and then sometime never. The Conservatives have cut back so far, nothing seems to get done on time. The council has accurately been described as the ‘vanishing council’.\n“This housing stock survey is critical in getting our planning rules toughened up to protect Kingsholm’s family homes. It cannot be delayed further by red-tape or more accurately blue-tape.”",

Jeremy Hilton (Kingsholm & Wotton) said: “The last adopted development plan dates back to 1983. Its 33 years old and a lot has changed in Gloucester since then. Both Labour and Conservative administrations, in that time, have failed to get updates to the plan adopted as required by the government. We are asking the cabinet member for housing & planning to report back to council in September on how he intends to deliver a new City Plan. We want it adopted as a matter of urgency.”\nThe current timetable for approving the new City Plan was for it to be approved by council in time to go to the planning inspector in the winter of 2016 for adoption in 2017. Liberal Democrats are concerned that the delays in approving a new City Plan could allow a developers to override current polices arguing they are out of date, despite many being formally being ‘saved’ by the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government in 2007.\nCllr. David Brown (Hucclecote), Lib Dem spokesperson for housing & planning said: “The city council have a timetable to deliver the City Plan but due to the delay in adopting the Joint Core Strategy (JCS) it is now woefully outdated. We need the council to be able to work with developers from a position of strength, with a clear plan for the city, a plan that best benefits current and future residents. For that we need a City Plan that is fit for the future sooner rather than later.”\nThe new City Plan should be a development document that sits beneath the JCS. It must explain how the council will implement the spatial vision and strategic objectives in the JCS up to the year 2031 and provide criteria that it will apply when considering planning applications for different types of buildings or other development.",

Spartans Ruby Club, which is based in Kingsholm, is looking for an additional pitch near to its club house, which is in neighbouring Sherborne Street.\nThe High School for Girls, which is in Denmark Road has also spoken to me about possible use of the sports field if it is saved from development.\nAll Redrow have done since acquiring the site in 2011 (for just £10,000) is shut the gates and demolish the club house etc, making the facilities unavailable for active sport that it had previously been used for.\nSimilarly, since acquiring the site Redrow have failed to properly discuss the future of the playing fields with the local community that is required in the Joint Core Strategy policy INF4. The lack of community engagement is lamentable.\nRedrow’s idea of consultation has been to lodge two full planning applications with the council, leaving no opportunity for the council or the community to hold discussions about how the site could be developed for some housing, but leaving the rest of the site available for sport and recreation.\nAs Keith Annis a senior manager at Redrow once told me they were playing for time. The question must be asked why has it taken them nearly two years from depositing the planning application to lodge an appeal?\nFor Redrow to appeal against non-determination is rather hypocritical, particularly to do this only a few weeks after lodging a new planning application for 100 dwellings on the same site (Ref 18/00306/FUL)\nFurther Comments\nA. Affordable housing:\nThe plan for affordable homes did not meet the council’s then standard, when the application was submitted, which was 40 %. The application lists 18 dwellings as intermediate housing, this is equates to 20% of the build.\nIt was impossible for the council to approve an application that did not meet this standard. Subsequently, the Joint Core Strategy has been adopted, where the new limit is set at 20%.\nB. Land Purchase:\nThe applicants purchased the sports ground from the Civil Service Sports Council Ltd for just £10,000 in 2011 (GR355501). The applicants should publicly declare the details of the uplift clause they have with Civil Service Sports Council Ltd.\nI believe it is this legal agreement that is responsible for the maximisation of housing on the site rather than what one would expect an open discussion with the council and community on a development brief that would benefit all.\nSome degree of housing whilst retaining the main sports field for sport and recreation, would benefit everyone.\nC. Alternative sport provision:\nIt may be that the land has not been used for sport for more than five years, but that is because of a deliberate policy by the landowners to close the ground for sporting activities.\nI concur with Sport England that the application should be refused.\nThe applicants have failed to identify alternative facilities that could accommodate sporting activities that previously took place on the Civil Service Sports ground.\nIn my opinion, alternative provision must be within the Kingsholm & Wotton ward.\nD. Joint Core Strategy INF3\nThe proposed development of 89 dwellings in my opinion is not consistent with JCS policy on green infrastructure. The former Civil Service Sport Ground provides a worthy green infrastructure asset that should be protected to help resolve the shortage of open space in Kingsholm and Wotton.\nI believe it is not beyond the wit of all parties to come up with a development solution that would provide much needed housing whilst retaining a large open space that could continue to be used for sport and recreation.\nHere is Policy INF3\n1. The green infrastructure network of local and strategic importance will be conserved and enhanced, in order to deliver a series of multifunctional, linked green corridors across the JCS area by:\ni. Improving the quantity and/or quality of assets;\nii. Improving linkages between assets in a manner appropriate to the scale of development, and\niii. Designing improvements in a way that supports the cohesive management of green\ninfrastructure;\n2. Development proposals should consider and contribute positively towards green infrastructure, including the wider landscape context and strategic corridors between major assets and populations. Where new residential development will create, or add to, a need for publicly accessible green space or outdoor space for sports and recreational on, this will be fully met in accordance with Policy INF4. Development at Strategic Alloca ons will be required to deliver connectivity through the site, linking urban areas with the wider rural hinterland\n3. Existing green infrastructure will be protected in a manner that reflects its contribution\nto ecosystem services (including biodiversity, landscape / townscape quality, the historic environment, public access, recreation and play) and the connectivity of the green infrastructure network. Development proposals that will have an impact on woodlands, hedges and trees will need to include a jus ca on for why this impact cannot be avoided and should incorporate measures acceptable to the Local Planning Authority to mi gate the loss. Mi ga on should be provided on-site or, where this is not possible, in the immediate environs of the site\n4. Where assets are created, retained or replaced within a scheme, they should be properly integrated into the design and contribute to local character and distinctiveness. Proposals should also make provisions for future maintenance of green infrastructure.\nE. Joint Core Strategy INF4\nAs I have previously mentioned the lack of serious community engagement by Redrow ahead of this planning application, about the future use of the site, is lamentable.\nRedrow have only showed plans that have proposed the complete building on the site, with the loss of the playing fields. They have never properly consulted anyone.\nI believe they failed to meet the requirement of Joint Core Strategy policy INF4 for social and community infrastructure\nHere is Policy INF4\n1. Proposals to develop land or buildings currently or previously in use as a community facility will demonstrate, including evidence of engagement with relevant local community groups and partner organisations, why the facility is no longer required and, as appropriate, how, when and where suitable local replacement facilities will be provided. Provision of replacement facilities will have regard to the locational and other relevant elements of this policy\n2. Where new residential development will create, or add to, a need for community facilities, it will be fully met as on-site provision and/or as a contribution to facilities or services o -site. New or refurbished provision will be of an appropriate type, standard and size. From an early stage, developers will be expected to engage with the relevant local authorities and infrastructure providers and, as appropriate, relevant local community groups where they exist, to ensure that new provision meets the needs of the community that it will serve and is t for purpose\n3. Social and community infrastructure should be centrally located to the population it serves and\nbe easily accessible on foot and by bicycle. It should be located so as to have the potential to be well-served by public transport. Developers should aim to provide flexible, multifunctional facilities within mixed-use developments, creating shared space which maximises benefits to the community and minimises land-take. In the case of open space, ‘easily accessible’ means it is located within reasonable walking distance of the development it serves. New facilities should be accessible to all members of the community, and be planned and phased in parallel with new development.\nF. Draft City Plan Policy SA06\nThe provision of 89 dwellings is in my opinion is overdevelopment of the site, which is in the heart of Kingsholm.\nCouncil policy as identified in the draft City Plan, which was approved by council in December 2016, recommends a maximum of twenty dwellings (SA06).\nThe proposal of 89 dwellings exceeds this policy by 445%, with the complete loss of the playing fields.\nA compromise of 40 dwellings, for example, on this site would mean that the former sports field could be brought back into use.\nG. Layout of the site:\nThe layout of the site does not follow the usual street pattern that is evident in Kingsholm. It is adjacent to both the Kingsholm and Denmark Road conservation areas.\nI am concerned that the narrow streets on estate may be become clogged up with motorists parking their cars on footpaths. This is a problem that will be exacerbated during times when there are rugby matches being played at the Kingsholm stadium.\nThe small public open space is set out to give the impression that it is an exclusive space just for the new residents of the estate. New public open space should laid out to be inclusive and available to all Kingsholm residents.\nH. Highway access:\nI am not convinced by the design of the access point onto Estcourt Road slip road.\nThe proposed access onto Denmark Road is unacceptable. It closes the slip road to Lansdown Road and removes much-needed parking spaces on Denmark Road.\nThe closure of the slip road will create more vehicle conflict at the other junction with Lansdown Road. This will be a particular problem when school coaches use this junction.\nThe closure of the slip road will also remove the u-turn provision it provides for the houses serviced off the dual carriageway section of Denmark Road on the south side.\nI. Public open space:\nKingsholm & Wotton has a low level of public open space as identified in the city council’s open spaces strategy. The council’s standard is 2.8ha per 1000\nBased on the new ward boundaries introduced at the 2016 election the ward has just 0.49ha per 1,000 population. Or 3.59ha for a population based on mid 2016 of 7,259 persons.\nAn opportunity is being missed in the proposed development to achieve a good increase in public open space provision in the ward by the wholesale development of the site, which was formerly used for sport and recreation.\nI would recommend that this appeal is dismissed.",

Currently the city council is controlled by the Conservatives, but the Liberal Democrats believe that the council could be run much better.\nLiberal Democrat leader, Cllr. Jeremy Hilton said: ”Services are not improving, budgets are being cut and we have had the first council tax rise in five years. The Tories are taxing responsible householders who recycle their garden waste by overcharging them for the garden waste collections. The Tory ‘Garden Tax’ adds £6 to the price of every green bin above what is needed to cover collection costs.\n“Regeneration in the city centre has stalled with the Kings Quarter project going nowhere. Its a shambles. The council administration needs to work much harder. We need to kick-start regeneration within the city centre. Kings Square has been unloved by the Conservatives and Labour for 25 years. We need to make this a great public space. We also need a new indoor market in a new location.\nThe last approved city plan for Gloucester dates back to the 1980s. We shall deliver a new city plan with policies to protect the environment, strengthen the economy and enhance the historic fabric of the city. We will do our best to encourage the building of more affordable homes to rent particularly within the social housing sector. We will also increase resources to defend council planning policies and decisions.”\n“There is so much to do and Liberal Democrats are up for the challenge.”\nA dozen ideas for a better city\n1. Market Parade or (White Friars) project\nWe will get this project started, which will include a new hotel, indoor market, city centre homes, car park and some retail. That is a true gateway into Gloucester, which is well linked to a refurbished railway station.\n2. Kings Square\nThis should be our premier open space in the city centre. It has been unloved by the council for 25 years. It must become a space for public events, dining and socialising, with (limited) new pavilion cafes, restaurants, and most of all, superb public art that pulls people to the square.\n3. Cathedral Quarter\nProject Pilgrim will help enhance the area around the cathedral, but we need to look at the whole of lower Westgate Street. How about refurbishing the small square outside Shire Hall or creating a visitors centre in Pitt Street, where the stone masons work keeping the cathedral in good condition?\n4. City Centre living\nWe must continue to support city centre living with new developments. The council must do more to encourage the conversion to housing of former office/commercial space within the city centre.\n5. City Centre environment\nThere are too many pound shops, turf accountants and tattoo parlours. We do need to improve our retail offer. There is no provision of high quality public toilets and this must be addressed. The pavements are littered with chewing gum and Liberal Democrats will invest in improving street cleaning in our city centre. The provision of public art in city centre is underwhelming.\n6. Regeneration Oversight\nRegeneration oversight is done behind closed doors and we propose to create a new Regeneration Scrutiny Committee to meet in public that can properly scrutinise the council’s regeneration plans. Lib Dems will bring Marketing Gloucester under tighter control by the city council.\n7. History\nWe live in a great historic city and we should promote this more effectively, with restoration of important buildings, festivals remembering our past & public art celebrating our 2,000 years of development. We would bring the new Culture Board under greater democratic control.\n8. University City\nWe must support the continued development of University of Gloucestershire in the city and encourage purpose built student accommodation in Blackfriars area to persuade year two and three students to stay in Gloucester rather than move to Cheltenham.\n9. Waste Collection\nLiberal Democrats will retain the current collection schedules and introduce recycling of cardboard and all plastics. We will scrap the Tories’ Garden Tax, placed on responsible householders who recycle their garden waste, by removing the surcharge for the collection of green wheelie bins.\n10. City Planning\nWe shall deliver a new city plan with policies to protect the environment, strengthen the economy and enhance the historic fabric of the city. We will do our best to encourage the building of more affordable homes to rent particularly within the social housing sector, despite the Tory government plans to ditch building new homes for rent. Lib Dems will invest extra resources in defending council planning polices and we will take necessary enforcement action against those who flout planning conditions.\n11. Homelessness\nWe shall focus on measures to reduce homelessness in the city. Working with partners, we will tackle drug and alcohol addiction, ensuring that homeless individuals with mental health issues get the support they deserve.\n12. Environment\nWe will crack down on dog fouling in parks, open spaces and on our streets. We will enhance our public parks and improve children’s play facilities. Liberal Democrats will remove the tacky advertising boards that the Tories installed that are now blighting our roundabouts.",

Jeremy Hilton has said that the process to get here has been long and drawn out, but there has been rigorous consultation with residents.\nCllr. Hilton said: “The traffic regulation order is due to be made on the 18th of May and it will be advertised in the local paper. Everyone who responded to the consultation will be notified.\n“The purpose of the new parking regulations is to give priority to residents and to relieve the area of parking congestion. Over the years I have had many requests to do something about the parking congestion problems in Kingsholm. Hopefully the new scheme, which has been subject to thorough design and consultation processes will improve the situation.”\nLetters are then due to be sent to residents just before 5th June 2023 outlining the start of the installation works. This will also contain details directing residents on how to purchase parking permits.\nResidents will be entitled to two permits per household. The cost of the first permit is £63.65 and the second car £127.60. There is a reduced charge for Eco cars (vehicle excise duty band A). Residents can also purchase 50 visitor vouchers a year.\nCould you confirm how many residents have complained about parking issues over the years please? I would like to compare it against how many are complaining about the scheme being introduced. Thank you.\nThe parking review was a periodic review of the existing regulations. It was extended to include the wider community. Residents have been requesting resolution of parking congestion and parking obstructions at junctions and on footways over the last few years.\nIt’s becoming more apparent how badly thought out this scheme is as the lines and bays are being painted, if anything, the number of parking spaces is being reduced, as a result of the space required to mark out the bays, bad parking in the bays is already evident resulting in one car taking up the space of two,\nThe app to sign up for the permit is generating a number of issues and I for one will not be chasing round trying to resolve any of these issues if it does not work when I try to sign up\nIt’s very apparent that lots of people didn’t want this. They may have wanted (including myself) better parking but were not informed of the detail until everything was approved. Once the detail has been put to us as you can see from various platforms it’s been met with disagreement. It’s a real shame we’re all having to spend so much of our time dedicated to this without any local authority support. That’s why people are very cynical towards the local authority with comments like “stealth tax” and a “money making scheme ” .\nThere was considerable consultation ahead of making the traffic regulation order. I did pass on comments I received to the parking team managing the process. By its nature the parking permit scheme being introduced on the 10th of July cannot please everyone.

The proposal to axe 60 job comes from the Conservatives who control the council.\nGloucester City Council is to see its funding from the Conservative government cut by £1.755m. Already the council has failed to fill 30 vacancies and another 30 jobs will be lost next year. Liberal Democrat councillors have said the staff shortages have led to delays and non-delivery of vital improvement projects.\nLib Dem leader, Cllr. Jeremy Hilton said: “The loss of so many jobs will have a major impact on council services. Sixty fulltime jobs going equates to 102,120 hours of support for key projects being lost forever. Already we are suffering from a diminished service from the council and it is going to get worse. Important improvement projects will not get done or will be delayed. It’s depressing. The Tories seem hooked on perpetual austerity.”\nLib Dem Deputy leader, Cllr. Declan Wilson said: “The blame for the loss of so many jobs must be shared between the Conservatives on the council and at Westminster. Budget cuts go on forever. This year the funding from Whitehall is being slashed by 18%. This is grossly unfair. On top of that we have had mismanagement of the council’s finances by the Tories leading to extra avoidable costs. The leader should apologise personally to the staff that will lose their jobs.”",

An inquest has opened into the deaths of two men who died after a tumble dryer caught fire.\nThe LGA is warning that companies who are running lengthy repair programmes for potentially dangerous machines, instead of recalling them, are risking the lives of millions of customers.\nIt is calling on manufacturers to recall affected tumble driers and for all white goods to have fire-proof markings on them, including the manufacturer, model and serial number, so they can be identified more easily if they are damaged after causing a fire.\nCllr Jeremy Hilton, Chair of the LGA’s Fire Services Management Committee, said:\n“People using faulty tumble dryers are unwittingly playing Russian roulette and leading manufacturers need to recall affected models as soon as possible to protect their customers.\n“Firefighters are attending tumble dryer fires three times a day, which is alarming. These defective products are endangering lives, causing thousands of pounds of damage to homes and making people homeless.\n“People’s safety must be the priority. It’s been months since some manufacturers issued safety warnings over their tumble dryers but they need to be recalled as these appliances are still causing fires – until they do so, consumers continue to risk falling victim to a devastating and tragic house fire.\n“Fire-proof markings on all white goods would also help improve manufacturing and safety standards by helping fire investigators identify the make and model of any appliance damaged after causing a fire.\n“Users must take simple precautions using tumble dryers. The compartment where fibres from fabric build up should be cleaned out after every load of clothes is dried, to reduce the risk of it igniting, and the vent or any other opening should not be covered.\n“People should never leave tumble driers on overnight or when they go out. Anyone buying an electrical item should complete the guarantee registration to ensure goods which do not meet safety specifications are repaired, replaced or refunded. This also enables manufacturers to contact owners in the event of a product recall.\n“People also need to ensure they have a working smoke alarm – which can be a life-saver – in the event something does go wrong and test them regularly, ideally once a week.”\nAnyone with concerns about the safety of electrical appliances can report them to the Citizens Advice consumer helpline on 03454 04 05 06.\nIt,s all very well saying they need to be changed or fixed but judging by the last three weeks of trying to get Hotpoint or even Currys to sort my issue out I firmly believe that customers of the failing dryers are just so fed up chasing the manufacturer or supplier that they give up trying………Hotpoint customer service department is shamefully to say the least and all Currys wants to do is say Sorry but don’t actually do anything. I opted to purchase a new dryer which seems simple enough , I went through with their online process, selected the dryer, picked a local shop , picked a date and then paid online …….The fateful day arrived……..local shop said nope……..not here. Their online ordering system indicated I had already exchanged the dryer and so it went on day after day of waiting in a queue for someone to help. One person actually said What do you expect Hotpoint to do ? In a sarcastic manner………All I wanted was the dryer I had paid for. So it does not surprise me that there are loads of possible fire risk units still out there……..seems Hotpoint are hell bent on slowing the process thus saving them money……rant over",

Currently £230,000 has been allocated for measures to be implemented in 2020. Scheme to be led by Gloucester City Council.\n· River Severn, Hempsted and Rea, Gloucester. Currently local levy funding has been allocated to develop a scheme to improve the existing defences to reduce flood risk to 132 properties and businesses. The earliest expected construction start date is 2021, subject to approval of a full business case and securing other funding contributions. This is to be led by the Environment Agency.\n· Alney Island Improvements, River Severn. A project to improve the standard of protection offered by the existing defences at Alney Island, Gloucester to 59 properties. £400,000 has been provisionally allocated towards a scheme. As the options develop the scheme costs are likely to increase. Currently construction estimated to start 2019, subject to approval of a full business case and the securing of any other funding contributions needed. This scheme will be led by the Environment Agency.",

There are sixteen interactive zones, which cover a range of scenarios including road, rail, water, home and personal safety. Those pupils going up into Year 5 this September will be able to take advantage of the zones and all what the facility offers.\nThe Liberal Democrat Spokesperson for Fire, Planning and Infrastructure, Cllr. John Cordwell (LD: Wotton-under-Edge) who is also Chair of the Stroud Road Safety Liaison Group said:\n“I’m pleased that for the third year running children from schools across Gloucestershire will have the opportunity to visit Gloucester’s SkillZone. It is a great fully interactive facility that is certainly worth a visit.\n“The take up over the past couple of years have been good and now it is running into a third year where more Year 5 groups will be able to come and learn how to recognise dangerous situations and stay safe.\n“I quote Benjamin Franklin (1706-1790) who said “an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure”, I’m confident that investment in children’s safety now will help reduce safety incidences in the future”.\nLeader of the Liberal Democrats, Cllr. Jeremy Hilton (LD:Kingsholm & Wotton) also said:\n“For three years running, the Liberal Democrats have proposed for all Year 5 pupils to visit this facility and evaluations from the last two years have shown the programme to be a huge success.\n“Since April 2014, a total of 13,844 children have visited SkillZone and of these 5,598 Year 5 pupils have attended as part of the Liberal Democrat scheme.\n“The evaluations undertaken this year shows that 100% of teachers were satisfied (98% very satisfied) with the safety education, 100% of teachers state that they think their pupils’ safety has been increased after the visit (88.5% to a great extent) and 100% felt that the session had a good or very good impact on the children (92% very good).\n“The Liberal Democrats have pushed for these visits to happen and I’m delighted that they will be continuing for another year. SkillZone is a fantastic and fun way of getting important safety messages across to our children.\n“I’d encourage all schools to take up the opportunity of bringing their Year 5 groups to such a place.”",

The facility will have staff on duty 24/7.\nThe young persons’ facility will have a health assessment unit, an educational day service and apartments for young people to be able to learn the skills of daily living to prepare them for adulthood. It will be inspected by Ofsted and the Care Quality Commission.\nThe county council held a public consultation on the 15th of May and another is planned during August.\nHere are the set of questions from Jeremy Hilton that took place at cabinet on the 24th of April. First set is the written questions and answers. The second set are the verbal supplementary questions and answers.\nThe cabinet report can be read online, click here:\nhttp://glostext.gloucestershire.gov.uk/documents/s51904/Item%2011%20-%20Gloucestershires%20Sufficiceny%20Strategy%20-%20Semi-Independent%20Project.pdf\nQuestion 1 – Jeremy Hilton\nThe report says the proposed remodelling of Trevone House will provide a resource centre for children and young people, provision of a health assessment unit, an educational day service and apartments for young people to be able to learn the skills of daily living to prepare them for adulthood. I agree that such a facility for young people in care is required in Gloucestershire, but what other properties in the county were considered and where are they located?\nAnswer 1 – Richard Boyles\nChildren Services over the past few years have considered a number of options in relation to providing provision of placements for children and young people in county. This has included looking at existing buildings, as well as purchasing new provision, both in urban and more rural areas. Unfortunately, these searches did not identify any potential properties with the scope that is being offered from using Trevone House. This project is innovative in its design, offering a multi agency approach to our young people. Because of this, it needs to be centrally located, accessible both for young people to access community resources, but also for staff and partners.\nQuestion 2 – Jeremy Hilton\nI was only briefed about this proposal on the 11th of April 2019, the day before the cabinet report was published. Local residents haven’t been consulted. What plans do you have to fully consult local residents, other care institutions and local schools based in Kingsholm? And will they be listened to?\nAnswer 2 – Richard Boyles\nA communications plan will be implemented, to engage with and listen to local residents, so that everyone has an opportunity to share their views. Our young ambassadors will be part of this process, bringing to life their journeys, working together not only for the development of this project but also for the life time of the provision, to reduce anxiety, mitigate risks and promote community cohesion.\nQuestion 3 – Jeremy Hilton\nIn paragraph 3.2, the report says that this proposal will provide accommodation for 16-20 year olds. Can you provide me with an assurance that no person will be placed at Trevone House who is over the age of 20 years?\nAnswer 3 – Richard Boyles\nThis project is to support young people moving onto independence from the age of 16 years, planning for them to move on to independent accommodation. In exceptional circumstances, where young people need more time or support due to their learning or emotional needs, consideration would be given for them to remain in placement post 20 years. These young people would have a robust transition plan in place.\nQuestion 4 – Jeremy Hilton\nWill the new young persons facility at Trevone House be a single gender provision? If not, what spilt in genders is expected?\nAnswer 4 – Richard Boyles\nThe accommodation will be co-ed, but this will be in the context of a needs lead service and planned placements. Placement matching is key to the success of this project and a panel will be in place to review placement referrals. This will be multi agency, with colleagues from Health, Police, Children’s Services and the provider. The panel will not only review the placement referrals, it will also monitor the young people in placement.\nQuestion 5 – Jeremy Hilton\nOn Radio Gloucestershire, (8am on 15th April 2019), Cllr Mark Hawthorne stated that there would be a minimum of 4 members staff on duty 24/7. Is this correct and how many staff will be on duty during the day and over the night?\nAnswer 5 – Richard Boyles\nThe whole concept of this project is to support and enable our young people to flourish and be aspirational in developing their plans for adulthood. Therefore, staffing is critical, not only in the numbers but the quality and skills of the staff team. There will be a minimum of four staff on duty at any one time, across the whole project. At times, where needed, there will be more staff on duty for those young people who need higher levels of support. Parts of the tendering process will require potential providers to evidence their staffs skills and training and supervision standards to ensure they meet the requirements of this. Given the nature of the project, there will be additional staff during the day to deliver the day service provision. The project will also have capacity to bring in additional staff as required and to support young people in distress, particularly those in need of health assessments\nThe following supplementary questions were asked at the meeting\nSupplementary Question 1 – Jeremy Hilton\nCllr Hilton referred to the large number of care institutions based in Kingsholm and stated how important it was not to overload the community with such facilities. Seeking clarification on the answer to his question, Cllr Hilton asked what other properties in the county had been considered as possible locations for a young person’s facility? Cllr Hilton asked Cllr Boyles to provide a written answer to the question, including the reasons why the locations had been dismissed as suitable premises.\nResponse by: Cllr Richard Boyles (Cabinet Member for Children and Young People)\nCllr Boyles explained that the project to provide a young person’s facility as was proposed four years ago under the IRIS project. After the Ofsted Inspection in 2017, a key part of Gloucestershire’s Sufficiency Strategy expanded the need for a wider range of local accommodation options. Cllr Boyles explained that some of the properties that had originally been considered were no longer suitable . The Gloucestershire Sufficiency Strategy aimed to cater for young people in the community. Cllr Boyles agreed to provide Cllr Hilton with a written response to his question after the meeting. He stated that, as the terms of the project grew, so did the terms of requirement.\nSupplementary Question 2 – Jeremy Hilton\nCllr Hilton acknowledged there was a communications plan but stressed the importance of consulting with the local community. Cllr Hilton asked for assurance that consultation had been done?\nResponse by: Cllr Richard Boyles\nCllr Boyles referred to the clear communications plan which set out the engagements that would be undertaken with the local community on a wide range of issues associated with the project, including bus services, schools and hospitals. Cllr Boyles agreed to provide a written response to the question after the meeting and assured Cllr Hilton the views of the local community would be listened to.\nSupplementary Question 3 – Jeremy Hilton\nCllr Hilton stated that, in the UK, a person reached maturity and was regarded as an adult by the time of their 18th birthday. Cllr Hilton asked Cllr Boyles to guarantee no new person over the age of 20 would be placed at Trevone House and that no one over age 20 would spend their first night in care at the house?\nResponse by: Cllr Richard Boyles\nCllr Boyles stated he was unable to promise that no one over the age of 20 would be placed at Trevone House. He explained some placements could roll over beyond the age of 18 and that he would need to consult with the team on the matter. Cllr Boyles did not envisage anyone over the age of 20 would be placed at the facility but could not give a definite yes or no at this time.\nSupplementary Question 4 – Jeremy Hilton\nCllr Hilton noted that the Care Quality Commission and Ofsted were regulators of the facility and asked how often and how rigorous were their inspections expected to be?\nResponse by: Cllr Richard Boyles\nCllr Boyles confirmed the inspections would be as rigorous as always and that the inspection reports would be available as and when the information was provided. The inspections would be annual but may be more frequent.\nSupplementary Question 5 – Jeremy Hilton\nCllr Hilton referred to a recent briefing with Cllr Boyles and the indication there would only be two people on duty overnight. Cllr Hilton also referred to a recent radio interview given by the Leader of the Council, Cllr Mark Hawthorne, where it was suggested there would be 4 members of staff on duty 24/7. Cllr Hilton sought clarification on how many members of staff would be on duty at the facility from 9pm to 9am?\nResponse by: Cllr Richard Boyles\nCllr Boyles confirmed there would be 4 members of staff on duty, once the facility was fully open. Until this time, and as the facility developed, the number of staff could be lower, dependent on the number of residents. Cllr Boyles said that everything would be risk assessed, with additional staff brought in if the risk was deemed appropriate.",

  "http_jeremyhilton_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_jeremyhilton_mycouncillor_org_uk_category_housing/content_187.html": "A promised housing stock survey in Kingsholm has been delayed yet again by council red-tape. The latest excuse was provided by the Conservative cabinet member in a written answer to a question from Lib Dem councillor for Kingsholm, Cllr.

It is currently permitted development for six persons or less.\nI/We the undersigned demand that the city council starts work immediately on preparing evidence and documentation to apply to the Secretary of State to give Kingsholm the protection of an Article 4 Direction.

Jeremy Hilton ahead of Conservative cabinet decision to approve their budget has issued the following statement. Total revenue spending for the council will drop by £2m to £417.98m despite an increase of 3.99% in the council tax.\nJeremy Hilton said:\n“The Tories plan to increase the council tax by 3.99%, the first rise in 5 years. Looking at the council’s finances it seems inevitable that the bill to local taxpayers will go up. It is clear the Conservatives are 100% culpable for the financial position the council is in. Despite this tax rise, spending will still drop by £2m next year.\n“The government has slashed the council’s core funding by £18m (9.5%), leaving the council short of funds to maintain services, whilst the Coalition’s ‘council tax freeze grant’ has also been scrapped. In order to make up shortfall in funding for adult care the government has introduced a social care levy, the “Osborne Tax”, which encourages a 2% increase in the council tax to prop up these important services. The Tories are placing the burden on local council taxpayers rather providing central government funding.\n“Locally, the council finances have been damaged by reckless management of council’s finances by Cllr. Hawthorne’s administration. They have squandered £17m in bailing out UBB on the incinerator contract. They have failed to balance the books with a whopping £8.9m overspend in one department, which soaks up 94% of the extra revenue from the 3.99% council tax increase. There will be bigger bills to local people, but cuts in actual funding for county services.\n“Liberal Democrats will be proposing some amendments to the budget, concentrating on roads, health and the environment, which we shall announce next week”",

We have worked hard to deliver our manifesto, from the Pupil Premium that is helping disadvantaged children, to the ‘triple lock’ that means pensions rise by at least 2.5% a year. The increase in the income tax threshold means people can now earn £10,600 tax-free.\nVince Cable has led the way on delivering two million new apprenticeships, which equates to more than 1,000 in Gloucester every year.\nI remember Labour’s attempt to stamp on our civil liberties with compulsory ID cards.

This will mean the delivery of an upgraded railway station with improved connectivity and a new bus station.\nThe regeneration of the Kings Quarter and the Blackfriars area around the old prison must be delivered with panache and completed in good time\nAs the MP for Gloucester, I will want to complete the work I have started on a bid for UNESCO World Heritage Site status for our magnificent Cathedral.\nToo many Gloucester children leave the city to go to secondary school – this is unfair.

The Tory ‘Garden Tax’ adds £6 to the price of every green bin above what is needed to cover collection costs.\n“Regeneration in the city centre has stalled with the Kings Quarter project going nowhere. Its a shambles. The council administration needs to work much harder. We need to kick-start regeneration within the city centre.

We will also increase resources to defend council planning policies and decisions.”\n“There is so much to do and Liberal Democrats are up for the challenge.”\nA dozen ideas for a better city\n1. Market Parade or (White Friars) project\nWe will get this project started, which will include a new hotel, indoor market, city centre homes, car park and some retail. That is a true gateway into Gloucester, which is well linked to a refurbished railway station.\n2. Kings Square\nThis should be our premier open space in the city centre. It has been unloved by the council for 25 years. It must become a space for public events, dining and socialising, with (limited) new pavilion cafes, restaurants, and most of all, superb public art that pulls people to the square.\n3. Cathedral Quarter\nProject Pilgrim will help enhance the area around the cathedral, but we need to look at the whole of lower Westgate Street. How about refurbishing the small square outside Shire Hall or creating a visitors centre in Pitt Street, where the stone masons work keeping the cathedral in good condition?\n4. City Centre living\nWe must continue to support city centre living with new developments. The council must do more to encourage the conversion to housing of former office/commercial space within the city centre.\n5. City Centre environment\nThere are too many pound shops, turf accountants and tattoo parlours. We do need to improve our retail offer. There is no provision of high quality public toilets and this must be addressed. The pavements are littered with chewing gum and Liberal Democrats will invest in improving street cleaning in our city centre. The provision of public art in city centre is underwhelming.\n6. Regeneration Oversight\nRegeneration oversight is done behind closed doors and we propose to create a new Regeneration Scrutiny Committee to meet in public that can properly scrutinise the council’s regeneration plans. Lib Dems will bring Marketing Gloucester under tighter control by the city council.\n7. History\nWe live in a great historic city and we should promote this more effectively, with restoration of important buildings, festivals remembering our past & public art celebrating our 2,000 years of development. We would bring the new Culture Board under greater democratic control.\n8. University City\nWe must support the continued development of University of Gloucestershire in the city and encourage purpose built student accommodation in Blackfriars area to persuade year two and three students to stay in Gloucester rather than move to Cheltenham.\n9. Waste Collection\nLiberal Democrats will retain the current collection schedules and introduce recycling of cardboard and all plastics. We will scrap the Tories’ Garden Tax, placed on responsible householders who recycle their garden waste, by removing the surcharge for the collection of green wheelie bins.\n10. City Planning\nWe shall deliver a new city plan with policies to protect the environment, strengthen the economy and enhance the historic fabric of the city. We will do our best to encourage the building of more affordable homes to rent particularly within the social housing sector, despite the Tory government plans to ditch building new homes for rent. Lib Dems will invest extra resources in defending council planning polices and we will take necessary enforcement action against those who flout planning conditions.\n11. Homelessness\nWe shall focus on measures to reduce homelessness in the city. Working with partners, we will tackle drug and alcohol addiction, ensuring that homeless individuals with mental health issues get the support they deserve.\n12. Environment\nWe will crack down on dog fouling in parks, open spaces and on our streets. We will enhance our public parks and improve children’s play facilities. Liberal Democrats will remove the tacky advertising boards that the Tories installed that are now blighting our roundabouts.",

It is near St Peter’s Primary School and the hospital is also in the area. Horton Road is already heavily congested and does not need more lorries travelling along it.\n“The proposal to increase the stockpile of stone from four to six metres will only exacerbate the risk of dust problems. The stockpile is just a few metres away from people’s homes.\nCllr Hilton has asked county planning officers to insist on an Environmental Impact Assessment, as the applicants think this is not required.\nResidents can post comments online at: www.gloucestershire.gov.uk/planning – Ref No. 15/0077/GLMAJW",

The council would buy back the ownership of Llanthony Secunda Priory for just one pound. This is a better solution than handing the priory over to the Official Receiver should the Llanthony Secunda Priory Trust become insolvent.”\nA successful trust today is not necessarily a successful trust tomorrow. We must protect the future of one of Gloucester’s most historic assets. The cabinet decision must be reconsidered and that is why Liberal Democrat councillors have called-in the decision so that it can be reconsidered.”\nCall-in notice\n“This is a request to call-in the cabinet decision made on the 11th of September, in relation to agenda item 12 – Llanthony Secunda Priory. The call-in is supported by members of the council who have acknowledged their support for this particular call-in via email.\nThe decision of cabinet was as follows:\n- That the restrictive covenants be removed in accordance with the request from LSPT.\n- That Planning Committee be requested to vary the S106 agreement relating to the property.\n- That the above are subject to agreeing a provision for continuing public access to the property and that the City Council shall have the continued right to nominate a Trustee.\nAhead of the cabinet decision Cllr. Jeremy Hilton did raise his concerns, at group leaders meeting (2nd September) about the proposal to remove covenants the council holds on Llanthony Secunda Priory and also to waive the original Section 106 Agreement.\nOn the 9th of September Cllr. Hilton wrote to the leader of the council asking him to withdraw the cabinet paper so that further discussion could take place. The leader responded negatively to Cllr. Hilton’s request and did not withdraw the cabinet paper. He suggested that if Cllr Hilton was not happy with his decision then Cllr Hilton should call-in the decision.\nThe original decision to sell Llanthony Secunda Priory to a management trust was made at full council on the 15th of February 2007.\nIn making the decision council agreed to the following clause:-\n‘To covenant the site so that should the Management Trust fail, ownership of the monument and its grounds would revert to the Council.’\nThe matter of whether council should remove the covenants it holds on Llanthony Secunda Priory is therefore a matter for full council and not cabinet.\n- The covenants were put there for the benefit of the city\n- The possibility of the trust failing was in the original risk assessment. This was mitigated by the covenant relating to the transfer of the land back to the council should the management trust fail.\n- The decision to go ahead with the trust was done on the understanding that this safeguard would remain.\n- A successful trust today is not necessarily a successful trust tomorrow.\n- To remove the covenant now would not therefore be in the best interests of the city as it could potentially put the future of one of Gloucester’s most important historical assets at risk.\nThe signatories to the call-in request that the decision of cabinet is reviewed in particular the resolution to remove the covenants that this council holds on Llanthony Secunda Priory.”",

Mark Hawthorne, the reason why he’s not joined 119 other leaders of English councils in signing a letter calling for greater devolution and an end to financial cuts imposed by the centre.\nThe Leader of the Liberal Democrats, Cllr. Jeremy Hilton (LD: Kingsholm and Wotton) said that: “I am disappointed that other Tory controlled regions in England have joined forces in signing this letter, but the Leader of Gloucestershire County Council has decided not to sign.\n“In the wake of the Scottish referendum we have the perfect opportunity for power to be devolved from London to this county. An opportunity that Mr. Hawthorne doesn’t appear to want to take.\n“I would like to hear publicly from Mr. Hawthorne why he felt this was a letter that his Tory colleague on Gloucester City Council could sign i.e. Cllr. Paul James, but that he could not.\n“Is it not the case that Mr. Hawthorne is quite happy being dictated to by a distant Whitehall?”\nDeputy Leader of the Liberal Democrats, Cllr. Iain Dobie (LD: Leckhampton and Warden Hill) also said that: “The question of devolution was debated last week at Shire Hall. Here, Mr. Hawthorne voted against a joint Lib Dem/Labour amendment asking him to write to the Prime Minister in encouraging more power to county and city regions.\n“The very fact that Mr. Hawthorne has not signed this letter gives me further reasons to believe that the Leader of Gloucestershire County Council does not want to seize this opportunity in taking greater local responsibility.\n“Taking power back from Whitehall is a good thing for the county, but needs the support from everyone – not least the Leader of the County Council. It would be good if the Leader of the Council speaks up for Gloucestershire.”\nENDS\nA417 upgrade good for road safety and reducing congestion\nToday the coalition government has reserved millions of pounds towards improvements along the A417 at the Air Balloon. These improvements will see the road converted to a dual carraigeway from Brockworth to Cowley roundabout. The estimated cost is £255m.\nLiberal Democrat parliamentary candidate for Gloucester, Jeremy Hilton has welcomed the government announcement.\nJeremy Hilton said: “The A147 along the missing link is congested and dangerous. Upgrading it to a dual carriageway will improve road safety and reduce congestion. Pollution levels will go down. Connectivity will get better, enhancing travel times from Gloucester to London and the South East This should boost the economy in Gloucestershire and create new jobs.\n“I now call on all of the county’s MPs and councillors to work together to back this scheme which will make this road safer and less congested.”\nFive Questions to cabinet member for the fire & rescue service\nThe Tory cabinet member for the fire and rescue service is Will Windsor-Clive. I have asked him these written questions for council on Wednesday (26 Nov). He needs to be challenged regularly over what seems to be the Tory administration’s cavalier attitude towards this important emergency service. His answers will be published on this website when I have them.\nQ1.\nCould you please provide me with the number of incidents that each of these stations were called out to in 2013/14 and the revenue cost of running each station?\n· Gloucester South\n· Gloucester North\n· Cheltenham West\n· Cheltenham East\nQ2.\nGloucestershire Fire & Rescue Service bid for funds available from the government’s £75 million Transformation scheme, to upgrade Tewkesbury Fire Station to improve water rescue facilities. Why did your bid fail?\nQ3.\nWhat financial savings do you plan to make on the fire and rescue budget between now and 2018?\nQ4.\nHow many times has Gloucestershire Fire and Rescue Service been called out to deal with a fire started by an e-cigarette?\nQ5.\nOn the 17th October, the new fire minister, Penny Mordaunt MP attended the LGA Fire Commission to answer questions from portfolio holders and chairs of local fire authorities. You are this council’s appointed member of the LGA Fire Commission, why did you not attend this meeting to ask a question yourself and listen to what she had to say about the future direction of the fire and rescue service?\nDisadvantaged Gloucestershire primary school pupils to receive £18.27 million boost\nDisadvantaged primary school pupils in Gloucestershire are set to receive £18.27 million to boost attainment, the Liberal Democrats have announced. The pupil premium funding for 2015/16 will help teachers support those children at most risk of falling behind their colleagues. It means primary schools will receive £1,320 for every pupil who has registered for free school meals at any time in the last six years. Evidence shows raising the attainment of pupils by the end of primary schools has a direct impact on future exam results.\nLiberal Democrat county group leader, Cllr. Jeremy Hilton said:\n“Every child should be able to reach their full potential, whatever their background. The pupil premium will get extra money to schools in Gloucestershire, targeted at the children who need it most. The whole class benefits when fewer children are struggling. Teachers in Gloucestershire do a great job, and I can’t wait to see how they use this additional funding to help all our children and young people succeed.”\nLiberal Democrat Schools Minister David Laws said:\n“In government, Liberal Democrats are building a stronger economy and a fairer society, with opportunity for everyone. We have already protected school budgets, introduced the pupil premium and expanded early years education for the very youngest children. This additional funding is another boost for schools in Gloucestershire Liberal Democrats are determined that teachers will continue to have the resources they need to give all pupils the best possible start in life, regardless of their background.”\nENDS…\nIntroduction of Free School Meals is Good News\nLiberal Democrats at Shire Hall are delighted that the Deputy Prime Minister’s free school meals initiative had the support of the council and is on track to be delivered from this September.\nThe free school meals policy, announced by the Liberal Democrat Leader and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg at the Liberal Democrat Autumn Conference last September will give all year 1 and 2 pupils free school meals.\nThe £450m funding in 2014/15 and £635m in 2015/2016 will be made available to the Department for Education to fund this commitment.\nThe equivalent of £2.30 for every meal served in Gloucestershire. A government grant of £1.2m is also being used to upgrade kitchen to deal with the 19,000 free school meals that will be served every day.\nCommenting, Leader of the Liberal Democrat Group, Cllr. Jeremy Hilton said that:\n“The introduction of free school meals for every single infant school pupil is a positive step in the right direction.\n“It is great initiative that will bring positive benefits encouraging positive eating habits and helping to improve concentration and performance in the classroom. It will also save families £420 per pupil per year.\n“I am disappointed that the Tories abstained in welcoming the free school meals initiative especially considering that nationally cross-party support has now been given for this policy”.\nENDS\nLiberal Democrat success: from 1st May residents parking permits cut to £50 per year\nThe annual cost of residents’ parking permits is to go down to £50 from the 1st May. The current price is £80 per year.\nThe decision to cut the price of the permits by 37.5% is all down to the Liberal Democrats who successfully moved an amendment to the county council budget when it was set in February.\nThe two wards that will mostly benefit are Kingsholm & Wotton ward and Westgate ward.\nJeremy Hilton (Kingsholm & Wotton) said: “It has been a long hard battle to get the cost of the residents’ parking permits reduced. It was wrong for the county council to overcharge for the cost of a permit. They were making a profit of £30. Now the price of the permit is the same as the cost of administration and enforcement.”\nSebastian Field (Kingsholm & Wotton) said: “Hopefully people living in streets with a permit scheme will be delighted with this news. £50 per year is better value than £80.”\nHoward Hyman the Liberal Democrat candidate for Westgate ward said: This great news for city centre residents. Having the cost of their parking permit slashed by 37.5% is a job well done by Liberal Democrat councillors serving on the county council.”\nLabour plan to abolish Gloucester City Council killed off\nThe county council’s local government structure task and finish group met yesterday to review evidence it has received from the district councils. The group was set up following a Labour motion. Labour are obsessed with creating unitary councils. This could mean reducing both Gloucester and Cheltenham councils to town council status – a ridiculous idea. Anyway the evidence received by the task and finish group proved conclusively that there are loads of problems to be faced if unitary local government were to be imposed in Gloucestershire.\nI am a member of this committee and I argued strongly yesterday to kill off Labour’s plans for unitary government in the county. I did the same when we debated the issue at full council. We don’t want to spend 5 years arguing about a new local government structure in Gloucestershire and where the new offices will be etc. We should just get on with the job of running council services under the system we currently have.\nThe good news is that all members of the task group, including Labour members, agreed to scrap any plans to consider creating monolithic unitary local government in Gloucestershire. This will now be reported to Overview and Scrutiny Management Committee and then to full council.\nAnnual election of Gloucestershire Couty Council leader proposed by Liberal Democrats\nA proposal being put forward by the County’s Liberal Democrats to the Council’s Constitution Committee on Monday could see changes to the length of the Council Leader’s tenure.\nThe Council’s Constitution currently stipulates that the term of office of the Leader starts on the day of his election and ends on the day of the next post election annual meeting.\nTo reduce the risk of leadership complacency and in order that the incumbent Leader remains effective and accountable to the Council the Liberal Democrats have recommended cutting the current four year term of office to yearly terms.\nIf approved the present Conservative Leader Cllr. Mark Hawthorne would need to be re-elected at next year’s annual Council meeting or see the election of a new Leader of Council.\nCllr. Jeremy Hilton (LD, Kingsholm & Wotton) said that:\n“Electing the Leader of the Council annually at the council’s AGM is good for both democracy and the people of Gloucestershire.\n“The Leader of the Council should be accountable to all fifty-three County Councillors who themselves represent the people that live in their own divisions.\n“The introduction of annual election for Leader, which is an option introduced in the legislation, would strengthen accountability and reduce any complacency.\n“Annual elections are held for the Chairperson and the same can be done for the Leader of the Council. This would give all members of the Council a chance to see what the Leader has done in the previous year and make their own judgments as to whether he or she has done a competent job worthy of re-election.”\nThe proposal that has been submitted will be debated at the Constitution Committee at Shire Hall for debate on Monday 7th October at 3pm.\nENDS\nLib Dems want the end of gagging of councillors on Gloucestershire County Council\nCalls for the removal of the maximum 30 minute rule for each political group to consider motions at full council have been proposed by the County’s Liberal Democrats.\nThe recommendation being put forward to the Council’s Constitution Committee next week in removing the current 30 minute rule will give elected members the opportunity to fully discuss individual motions with no time limits. The time allowed to debate motions differs widely amongst local authorities across the country from a maximum of 30 minutes currently in Gloucestershire to no time limits in councils such as Cumbria. To reduce the risk of debates being too open ended the Liberal Democrats accepts there should be a total period of time spent on motions. It has been suggested that the maximum two hour limit be extended to three hours.\nCllr. Jeremy Hilton (LD, Kingsholm & Wotton) proposer of the motion said that: “For eight years the Tory stifled discussion on the big issues affecting Gloucestershire by using an oppressive guillotine on the length of debates. “Now the council has moved into no overall control we must relax the rules to allow all 53 councillors the opportunity to debate the major issues in the council chamber. “Our amendments to the constitution remove the guillotine on length of motions bringing democracy to Shire Hall.”\nThe Deputy Leader of the Liberal Democrat Group and Constitution Committee member Cllr. Paul Hodgkinson (LD, Bourton-on-the-Water & Northleach) also said that: “The time has now come where there is a need for full and unrestricted debate on those issues that are important to both the elected member and the constituents that they represent in the interests of transparency and democracy. “As a member recently elected I’ve been saddened that open debate has been stamped upon and councillors with valid points to make have been effectively gagged under the Council’s current rules. The proposal that has been submitted will be debated at the Constitution Committee at Shire Hall for debate on Monday 7th October at 3pm.\nENDS\nTrading Standards Service – Vital say Lib Dems\nCounty councillors will debate the future of Gloucestershire’s Trading Standards service when they meet on the 4th of September. Liberal Democrat councillors have lodged a motion calling for the services to be protected, if possible, from further cuts.\nTrading Standards has seen its budget cut by 51%, down from £2m in 2010/11 to just £1m in 2013/14. Similarly, the number of staff employed has dropped from 46 to 24.\nLiberal Democrat councillors believe the service cannot take any further cuts without damaging the protection to the public and businesses that Trading Standards currently provides.\nThe proposer of the motion, Cllr. Jeremy Hilton (Kingsholm & Wotton) said: “The number of scheduled inspections and enforcements visits has dropped dramatically since 2010. There were just 139 scheduled inspections in the last financial year compared to 366 in 2010/11. This is a worrying trend. Trading Standards provides an important service, protecting the consumer and legitimate businesses from rogue traders. We should remember the horsemeat in beef products scandal and the important role Trading Standards has in inspecting food products. The service, in my view, just cannot take any further cuts.”\nCllr. Iain Dobie (Leckhampton and Warden Hill) who will second the motion said: “Trading Standards has to enforce over 100 Acts of Parliament. It does a vital job in protecting the public – especially the most vulnerable. With the county council’s new responsibility for public health, the work the service does protecting the public from unsafe goods and policing age restricted protects (such as alcohol and tobacco) is more important than ever. ”\nThe Liberal Democrat motion recommends that the Trading Standards service is protected, if possible, from further cuts during the life of the council (4 years).\nEnds…\nNotes\nTrading Standards Service undertakes a wide range of enforcement activities related to:\n- welfare of farm animals and the prevention of disease outbreaks\n- doorstep crime and rogue trader activity\n- the safety of goods\n- food composition and description\n- age restricted products\n- unfair trading practices\n- weights and measures\n- petroleum, poisons and explosives licensing.\nMotion\n“This council commends the public protection work carried out by the trading standards service in Gloucestershire.\nThis council notes that trading standards is a statutory service that protects the most vulnerable consumers in dealing with ‘rogue traders’ and also helps legitimate traders to trade well.\nThis council recognises that over the last three financial years, the county’s trading standards service budget and total number of employees has been cut by 50%.\nThis council is concerned that any further cuts to the current trading standards service may put individuals, communities and public health more generally at risk, and could damage local businesses and the economy.\nThis council therefore recommends that the trading standards service is protected if possible from further cuts during the life of this council.”\nProposed – Cllr. Jeremy Hilton\nSeconded – Cllr. Iain Dobie",

Jeremy Hilton said:\n“The state of many of the footways in Gloucester is shocking, in particular on our post-war housing estates and the older parts of the city. These footpaths are decades old and they need resurfacing rather than patching. The funds allocated by the Conservative run county council on resurfacing are inadequate. The county council must increase spending on footway repairs next year and beyond.”\nLiberal Democrats have been critical about the Tories who have recently agreed to spend a £1m on new telephones for Shire Hall and have given contractors UBB £30m in a cash gift to build the waste incinerator at Javelin Park. Money the Lib Dems say could have been better spend on repairing our roads and footpaths.\nCllr. Emily Ryall who will second the motion said:\n“It is unacceptable that the Conservative run county council do not see it as a priority to spend taxpayers’ money on ensuring that our pavements and footpaths are safe and fit for purpose. I have heard from residents in my ward of Elmbridge who struggle to manoeuvre wheelchairs, and have suffered twisted ankles and even head injuries from falling, due to uneven and broken surfaces. These residents deserve better.”\nEnds….\nMotion – poor maintenance of footways in Gloucester\n“This council expresses its deep concern about the state of many of the footways in Gloucester, noting that the county council has only budgeted to spend £83,000 from its capital budget on footways repairs within the city council boundaries this financial year.\nThis council notes that there are many footpaths, particularly on post-war housing estates, that are in desperate need of resurfacing.\nThis council therefore calls on Gloucestershire County Council to increase its capital spending on footway repairs within Gloucester for the 2017/18 council year and beyond.”\nProposed by Jeremy Hilton\nSeconded by Emily Ryall",

Jeremy Hilton (Kingsholm & Wotton) said: “The number of scheduled inspections and enforcements visits has dropped dramatically since 2010. There were just 139 scheduled inspections in the last financial year compared to 366 in 2010/11. This is a worrying trend. Trading Standards provides an important service, protecting the consumer and legitimate businesses from rogue traders.

One of the roads most affected by the loss of family homes being converted into Houses in Multiple Occupation\nA promised housing stock survey in Kingsholm has been delayed yet again by council red-tape. The latest excuse was provided by the Conservative cabinet member in a written answer to a question from Lib Dem councillor for Kingsholm, Cllr. Jeremy Hilton.\nThe survey is planned so that the council can provide definitive evidence that too many family homes in Kingsholm are being converted into Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMO).\nA 130-signature petition was handed into the cabinet by Jeremy Hilton in November 2020.\nThe Petition said:\n“Too many family homes in Kingsholm are being converted into Houses in Multiple Occupation, without planning permission being required. It is currently permitted development for six persons or less.\nI/We the undersigned demand that the city council starts work immediately on preparing evidence and documentation to apply to the Secretary of State to give Kingsholm the protection of an Article 4 Direction. This means that all conversions of family homes into Houses in Multiple Occupation would require planning permission.”\nCllr. Jeremy Hilton said:\n“Lib Dems tried to amend the council plan in July 2020 to get the work started on a housing stock survey, but the Conservatives voted it down.\n“That is why I raised an online petition to get public support. I handed it in at the November 2020 cabinet.\n“Shortly afterwards, I met officers who suggested we schedule the survey work for April this year. Then it was delayed until the summer to be part of a countywide housing survey.\n“Now the Cabinet Member for Planning and Housing Strategy says there have been delays because of legal queries and the tender documents haven’t been issued. It is ridiculous, the word incompetence comes to mind.\nThe written question and the answer published in the council papers of the 23rd of September 2021\n“Kingsholm residents are frustrated by the Conservative council’s reluctance to treat Kingsholm as a special case. We see the onward creep of Houses in Multiple Occupation and the damage done to the community. Parking, noise and litter all contribute to the degradation of our once-quiet streets.”\nJeremy Hilton concluded:\n“It is very frustrating trying to get projects implemented at the city council. We are given dates, then later dates and then sometime never. The Conservatives have cut back so far, nothing seems to get done on time. The council has accurately been described as the ‘vanishing council’.\n“This housing stock survey is critical in getting our planning rules toughened up to protect Kingsholm’s family homes. It cannot be delayed further by red-tape or more accurately blue-tape.”",

Repairing our roads, filling in potholes\n2. Growing our economy, investing in jobs\n3. Opposing a waste incinerator, protecting the environment\n4. Freezing on-street parking charges, cutting the price of residents’ parking permits\n5. Making sure we can trust what we eat, protecting trading standards\n6. Creating a new joint fire and ambulance service, for a safer county\nFurther details of these and other policy areas will be published in the Gloucestershire Liberal Democrat 2013 Manifesto entitled ‘Caring for Gloucestershire’. The launch of this manifesto will take place on the steps of Shire Hall at 10am on Monday 11 March.\nSpeaking in advance of the full manifesto publication, Leader Cllr. Jeremy Hilton said:\n“Our ‘six-to-fix’ priorities will benefit all those who live and work in Gloucestershire not just a select few. These top priorities along with our other plans included in the manifesto have been brought together by listening to the people of this county.\n“We believe that more can be done to improve the quality of services provided by Gloucestershire County Council. Our manifesto to be launched on Monday is a plan that will help people across the county understand who we are, what we represent and what is important.\n“This manifesto spells out our county policies taking us up to the County Elections and beyond. We believe our manifesto highlights that a Liberal Democrat run-council will not cut corners. A Liberal Democrat run-council will commit to delivering a better future for everyone in Gloucestershire.”\nENDS…\nNotes:\nThe Liberal Democrat top six priorities with commentary as follows:\n1. Repairing our roads, filling in potholes\nLiberal Democrats will invest in additional repairs to our roads and footways to repair the damage left after eight years of Tory neglect. We will release £5 million worth of surplus funds in the council’s reserves to help fix the enormous number of potholes on the county’s roads.\n2. Growing our economy, investing in jobs\nThe county council will work with the Local Enterprise Partnership to create more private sector jobs and apprenticeships. Liberal Democrats will support growing businesses to achieve their goals and will also work to establish new businesses in manufacturing, advanced technologies and the green economy.\n3. Opposing a waste incinerator, protecting the environment\nWe have strongly opposed the building of a £500m waste incinerator at Javelin Park on environmental and economic grounds. We will seek to use more environmentally friendly technology to dispose of the residual household waste.\n4. Freezing on-street parking charges, cutting the price of residents’ parking permits\nA Liberal Democrat council will freeze on-street car parking charges across Gloucestershire. In residents’ parking permit zones Liberal Democrats will reduce the annual fee from £80 to £50.\n5. Making sure we can trust what we eat, protecting trading standards\nThe Tories have slashed spending on Trading Standards by 50% at a time when the service is under greatly increased pressure with the controversy over horse meat in beef products. It needs to be in the forefront of testing food products on sale locally. There will be no further cuts in Trading Standards under the Liberal Democrats.\n6. Creating a new joint fire and ambulance service, for a safer county\nWe will lobby the government to establish a pathfinder project for a joint Gloucestershire fire and ambulance service under the control of the county council.",

It was taken at the midway point between Rivermead Close and Greville Close along the built-up section of Sandhurst Lane.\nCllr. Jeremy Hilton said: “The results confirm what many of us already knew that far too many motorists are speeding along Sandhurst Lane. They are breaking the 30mph speed limit and risking the lives of pedestrians walking on the narrow footways.\n“There is a clear road safety issue here that the county council must resolve. I have asked the county traffic manager to propose a solution that will help reduce traffic speeds to below the 30mph limit.\n“Even though the results suggest northbound vehicles are not breaking the limit have seen motorists accelerate aggressively as they pass by Rivermead Close.”\nCllr.

Jeremy Hilton (LD: Kingsholm and Wotton) who called for financial regulations to be tightened said:\n“There has been a seemingly lack of financial propriety in that substantial sums of money have been moved around in this council’s reserves in order for the Conservative Cabinet to award Urbaser Balfour Beatty a further £17million for the waste incinerator project at Javelin Park that no one apart from them actually wants.\n“The minority Conservative administration seems to have forgotten that we are a Council in no overall control. They must consult with all parties when making changes to the agreed budget.\n“I was a Cabinet Member from 2001-2005 and I had to seek council’s approval to be awarded less than £1million for the Tri-Service workshop project.\n“Awarding large sums of tax-payers money ‘by a nod and a wink’ is unacceptable and changes need to be made to stop this from happening again in the future. I’m concerned that new projects have been deleted and on-going projects will now no longer happen, because of the awarding this extra £17m to UBB.\n“I’m pleased that this will be looked at by the council’s Constitution Committee of which I am a member. I hope to see vital changes to our constitution reported back to full council at the earliest opportunity in the new year.”\nLiberal Democrat Deputy Group Leader, Cllr. Iain Dobie (LD: Leckhampton and Warden Hill) who supported calls for such changes to take place also said that:\n“I was told, with authority, that an overspend of 1% of budget would be defined as a scrutiny-worthy “significant overspend” – Here, we are considering as exceptional shift of £17million, which is 4% of the county’s overall budget of this year. This is a highly significant budgetary reallocation.\n“Early this year the budget for this council was brought for a vote by all councillors. So, surely, any such administration which plans, late in the financial year, to significantly shift county spending is a matter for all members of this council to approve.\n“I believe that democracy is undermined if cabinet members are allowed to shift significant sums as they please without respecting what was voted on by all county councillors in the budget debate. If the precedent of £17 million is allowed to stand unchallenged this time then why not £70 million next time?”\nThe issue will be discussed at the next Constitution Committee meeting on Friday 8th January at 10am.",

It must become an attractive focal point at this location on London Road.\nThis is my question\n“There have been some teething problems in creating the Wellington Parade Garden on London Road.\n“It’s been redesigned after comprehensive public consultation into a form that should encourage pedestrian movements though it and discourage street drinkers congregating there day after day.\n“Could the cabinet member please give me an assurance that the snagging problems will be resolved, with extra care being given to allowing the shrubs, trees and other plants to become well established in the garden?”\nHere is Cllr. Raymond Padilla’s answer\n“The redevelopment of the site has been completed. The garden was officially opened and available to the public on the 28th October 2022.”\n“Assurances can be given that the snagging problems are being resolved, the shrubs, trees and other plants are being cared for allowing them to become well established in the garden.\n“We are working with Emerging Futures who are currently litter picking as and when required. They are also going to be painting the fence and repairing the fire damaged area.\n“Volunteers will also be planting bulbs to bring some colour to the area for Spring 2023 as well as ongoing upkeep of existing planting.\nHere are some other agreed actions\nStrong guards are to be put around the two trees.\nStreet name plates will be installed for both Great Western Road and Wellington Parade.\nWork will be carried out to ensure the small brick wall cannot be sat on.\nBoth myself and Cllr.

This all follows on from motion 881 put to the county council in September 2021 by the Liberal Democrat group.\nJeremy Hilton who seconded the motion said: “The deadline for submissions was the 27th of November and it has been oversubscribed.\n“There has been no shortage of applications for a grant from the Levelling Up Together fund related to proposed projects in Kingsholm & Wotton. Much more than the £150,000 allocated to my division.\n“I have had my first meeting with officers and Cllr. Hawthorne to look at the proposals. Some are specific to my division and some are multi area applications. My priority is to support those projects that especially help Kingsholm residents who are most in need of additional support, by providing better life opportunities.”\nA decision on which projects will be funded is expected in the New Year.\nMy latest Spotlight newsletter (edition 222).

One of the roads most affected by the loss of family homes being converted into Houses in Multiple Occupation\nA promised housing stock survey in Kingsholm has been delayed yet again by council red-tape. The latest excuse was provided by the Conservative cabinet member in a written answer to a question from Lib Dem councillor for Kingsholm, Cllr. Jeremy Hilton.\nThe survey is planned so that the council can provide definitive evidence that too many family homes in Kingsholm are being converted into Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMO).\nA 130-signature petition was handed into the cabinet by Jeremy Hilton in November 2020.\nThe Petition said:\n“Too many family homes in Kingsholm are being converted into Houses in Multiple Occupation, without planning permission being required. It is currently permitted development for six persons or less.\nI/We the undersigned demand that the city council starts work immediately on preparing evidence and documentation to apply to the Secretary of State to give Kingsholm the protection of an Article 4 Direction. This means that all conversions of family homes into Houses in Multiple Occupation would require planning permission.”\nCllr. Jeremy Hilton said:\n“Lib Dems tried to amend the council plan in July 2020 to get the work started on a housing stock survey, but the Conservatives voted it down.\n“That is why I raised an online petition to get public support. I handed it in at the November 2020 cabinet.\n“Shortly afterwards, I met officers who suggested we schedule the survey work for April this year. Then it was delayed until the summer to be part of a countywide housing survey.\n“Now the Cabinet Member for Planning and Housing Strategy says there have been delays because of legal queries and the tender documents haven’t been issued. It is ridiculous, the word incompetence comes to mind.\nThe written question and the answer published in the council papers of the 23rd of September 2021\n“Kingsholm residents are frustrated by the Conservative council’s reluctance to treat Kingsholm as a special case. We see the onward creep of Houses in Multiple Occupation and the damage done to the community. Parking, noise and litter all contribute to the degradation of our once-quiet streets.”\nJeremy Hilton concluded:\n“It is very frustrating trying to get projects implemented at the city council. We are given dates, then later dates and then sometime never. The Conservatives have cut back so far, nothing seems to get done on time. The council has accurately been described as the ‘vanishing council’.\n“This housing stock survey is critical in getting our planning rules toughened up to protect Kingsholm’s family homes. It cannot be delayed further by red-tape or more accurately blue-tape.”",

Today the report of the air pollution task group, chaired by Cllr. Jeremy Hilton (Lib Dem Kingsholm & Wotton), is published.\nAccording to Public Health England, poor air quality is the largest environmental risk to public health in the UK, and the Royal College of Physicians has estimated that poor air quality is responsible for 40,000 premature deaths in the UK annually.\nExposure to air pollution can affect health by contributing to the development of cardiovascular disease, lung cancer, and respiratory diseases, and can limit an individual’s quality of life.\nCllr. Jeremy Hilton said: “Public bodies in Gloucestershire need to do much more to reduce vehicle air pollution. We have a number of poor air quality hot spots in the county. Nitrogen Dioxides and particulate matter from vehicle emissions is a hazard to everyone’s health in the county. We have to take action to reduce these pollutants.\n“I shall be taking the report of the air pollution task group to the Environment & Community Scrutiny Committee next week, where I hope it is approved, before it is sent on to the county cabinet on the 6th of June.”\nThe report has a dozen recommendations that include the establishment of a Gloucestershire Air Quality Partnership to oversee future work. This will be helped by better air quality monitoring with a focus on particulate matter. Changes to planning policies are suggested. Highway interventions are recommended to reduce traffic congestion and air pollution.\nThe task group wishes to encourage the greater use of electric vehicles and also to set stronger targets to increase journeys by bicycle, on foot and public transport. It wants to see the use low emissions buses etc.\nCllr Hilton concluded: “This report is just a start. I would like to that everyone who came along to the workshop we held in January and to the members of the air pollution task group that helped draft the report.”\nThe Lib Dems are demanding answers over a shortage of refuse lorry drivers in Gloucester.\nDrivers of the bin trucks are leaving to get better paid jobs elsewhere – meaning the city’s residents are getting a worse service.\nLocal residents are complaining about missed collections as waste contractor Amey struggles to cope with demand.\nA recent council report floated the idea of black bin collections going from every two weeks to every three weeks.\nBut this was rejected for now by the Conservative cabinet because recycling rates are not high enough – although has not been ruled out in the future.\nThe Lib Dems understand that the city council has asked Amey to review pay structures and give the drivers more money to stop them leaving.\nCouncillors have asked a series of questions to city council bosses about waste services in Gloucester.\nCllr. Howard Hyman (Lib Dem – Elmbridge) said:\n“The last thing we want is Gloucester turning into Birmingham with Amey in dispute with its own staff, piles of uncollected black bags lining the streets and residents forced to take their rubbish to the tip.\n“The Conservatives on the city council need to get a grip of this problem. We’ve been raising problems about the bin collections across Gloucester for some time now.”\nGroup leader Cllr. Jeremy Hilton (Lib Dem – Kingsholm & Wotton) agreed:\n“The city council and Amey need to sit down together and sort this mess out.\n“The Tory council needs to stop trying to extract every pound from the waste contract while Amey should pay the refuse lorry drivers a decent wage for what is a hard job otherwise the only winners here will be the rats, not the residents of Gloucester.”\nGLOUCESTER Conservative candidate Richard Graham is being challenged to say whether he backs his leader Theresa May’s plans to scrap free school lunches.\nJeremy Hilton – his Liberal Democrat opponent in the General Election on June 8 – is challenging Mr Graham to say whether he will vote to take away lunches from hard-pressed families should he be re-elected to Parliament.\nMrs May’s plan to scrap free school lunches could hit children’s health by depriving hundreds of thousands of pupils of their five-a-day, according to the Liberal Democrats.\nUnlike school lunches, there are no nutritional guidelines or minimum portions for breakfasts.\nThis means while pupils currently get at least two to three of their five a day with free lunches, with free breakfasts they could potentially get none.\nCurrent standards would allow school breakfasts to consist mainly of processed breakfast cereals, toast with sweetened spreads, and there would be no limit on the total amount of sugar children can consume.\nMr Hilton, a well-known local councillor in Gloucester, is the main challenger to Mr Graham, who is seeking re-election as city MP.\nIn May’s county council elections, the Liberal Democrats came second in total number of votes cast in Gloucester. Labour finished third.\n“Theresa May’s plans would hit children’s health by depriving them of a free nutritional meal at school,” Mr Hilton said.\n“This is particularly short-sighted when we are struggling with soaring levels of childhood obesity.\n“The Liberal Democrats will protect free school lunches for infants and ensure all primary school children can get a healthy, free lunch a day.\n“The Liberal Democrat manifesto commits to extending free school meals to all children in primary education. We will also promote school breakfast clubs.\n“Richard Graham must make it clear whether he will vote in the House of Commons to take away lunches from hard-pressed families or stand up to Theresa May for the sake of the education and good health of our children.\n“Theresa May should take her inspiration from Jamie Oliver not Oliver Twist.”\nNHS Digital figures from November 2016 show over a fifth of reception children were overweight or obese. In Year 6 over a third of children were overweight or obese.\nEnds…\nIt has taken a long time, but at last Hyde Lane has been resurfaced, thanks to the single-minded determination of Lib Dem county councillor, Jeremy Hilton (Kingsholm & Wotton). His persistence has paid off.\nThe top end of Hyde Lane is currently a private road, but it is also a signposted pedestrian route to Gloucestershire Royal Hospital. Following the resurfacing, the road will be adopted by the county council.\nJeremy Hilton said: “I finally secured funding from the county council for the road to be repaired last year. The road was resurfaced the week of 6th March.\n“Hyde Lane was full of potholes and unsafe for pedestrians to use. In particular, for elderly or disabled patents using this route to get to a hospital appointment.\n“We must remember that besides residents of Kingsholm using this way to get to the hospital, people arriving on the No. 10 or No. 94 bus do so as well.\n“I am pleased that after such a long time I finally got the lane resurfaced.”",

To change the governance arrangements of such a service would not only be unnecessary but simply reckless.\n“It is not compulsory for our Police and Crime Commissioner, Mr. Surl to put in a bid and one that could severely damage the superb collaboration that already exists between the blue light services at the county’s Tri-Service Centre in Quedgeley.\n“A recent inspection undertaken by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) and published this month was extremely critical in that Gloucestershire’s Constabulary requires improvement at keeping people safe and reducing crime.\n“The report unfavourably went on to say that the county’s force ‘does not use intelligence well to identify threat or risk of harm within its communities, and its problem – solving activity lacks consistency.\n“This was a damning inspection report of Mr. Surl’s own force, and it would be highly advisable that he gets his own house in order before unnecessary tampering with a fire & rescue service which is not broke and doesn’t require fixing.”\nLiberal Democrat Spokesperson for Fire & Infrastructure, Cllr. Bernie Fisher (St Paul’s & Swindon) also said:\n“There are fundamentally two questions here – one, will transition make it more efficient and less costly to run, and two, will it improve collaboration for better delivery of the service?\n“I very much doubt that such a move will satisfy either of these two questions.\n“Gloucestershire Fire & Rescue Service is part of the County Council and includes other services such as Emergency Management, Trading Standards, Registrars, Coroners and the Road Safety Partnership.\n“The Service is the most cost effective in England and now provides co-responder services to support the ambulance service, targeted work (particularly around dementia), telecare responses (helping to keep people in their own homes) and has led on community resilience (Including Emergency Management and Trading Standards).\n“Their biggest role is now around preventative services for adults. It is a service that now does so much more than putting out fires.

She promised to respond to its request.\nLib Dem councillor Isabel Brazil concluded: “If St Paul’s in Cheltenham can have an Article 4 Direction, requiring planning permission for all new HMOs, then so can Kingsholm. We must protect our community from unregulated change.”\nOn Thursday (19th Nov 2010), the city council will debate a motion being proposed by Lib Dem councillors Jeremy Hilton and Sebastian Field calling for the upgrade of Gloucester Railway Station to start on-site in the first quarter of 2021.\nEarlier this year it was reported that the £4.3 million upgrade had been topped up by a further £1.7 million. Taking the total allocated to this project to £6 million.\nThe project will involve a major upgrade of the underpass running from Bruton Way to Great Western Road. The Lib Dems want this to be the number one priority.\nLib Dem leader, Cllr. Jeremy Hilton said: “We have been waiting ages for the railway station improvement project to start. Now it is fully funded and the partners have set up a project board, they must get on with it. We want to see construction workers on site in the first quarter of next year. The underpass upgrade must be the first priority. It’s a grotty underpass, with steep steps and feels unsafe to walk through. We have been waiting years for it to be upgraded. Let’s make 2021 the year the construction begins.”\nThe railway station project will also deliver a more attractive station facade, that will have its own bus stop and new exit onto Metz Way.\nThere will be 10 electrical vehicle charging spaces, more cycle racks, solar panels and a new canopy at the front of the station for travellers waiting to be picked up.\nCllr. Sebastian Field added: “Lib Dems want to encourage greater use of public transport. We have a new bus station and we need an upgraded railway station to complement it. We must make sure that our public transport facilities are fit for the 21st Century.”\nLib Dem deputy leader, Cllr. Declan Wilson concluded: “Travellers by train deserve better, this project should give Gloucester a railway station to be proud of.”\nKingsholm Liberal Democrats have launched a new petition to stop the area being overwhelmed by Houses in Multiple Occupation.\nFamily homes are being converted into properties suitable for renting and can lead to issues with noise, rubbish and parking.\nThere can also be problems with getting landlords to deal with incidents of anti-social behaviour.\nCurrent planning rules do not require permission for new HMOs of less than six people.\nAreas such as St Paul’s in Cheltenham have an Article 4 Direction, which requires planning permission for all new HMOs.\nLiberal Democrat councillors Jeremy Hilton and Isabel Brazil recently tried in vain to persuade the Tory administration on the city council to do a housing stock survey immediately, which would be a precursor to an Article 4 designation for Kingsholm.\nCouncillor Isabel Brazil said: “It has been noticeable that in recent times more and more family homes in Kingsholm are being converted into Houses in Multiple Occupation.\n“This is changing the nature of the community as absentee landlords buy up homes and let rooms to individuals to maximise their income.”\nCouncillor Jeremy Hilton added: “We are raising a petition to demand that the city council starts work right now on preparing the evidence to apply for Article 4 Direction to the Secretary of State.\n“We cannot have Kingsholm overrun by HMOs, we need a fair balance.”\nAn independent cinema in Gloucester has been awarded a Government grant to help it weather the storm of the coronavirus pandemic.\nThe Sherborne Cinema in Kingsholm will get £8,940 from the Culture Recovery Fund.\nA total of 42 cinemas will share more than £650,000 of funding allocated by the British Film Institute on behalf of the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport.\nCouncillor Jeremy Hilton, who represents Kingsholm & Wotton, said: “The Sherborne Cinema is in the heart of Kingsholm.\n“It’s a lovely place to watch a film on the big screen. Many Kingsholm residents are regular customers.\n“I am delighted that the Sherborne Cinema has received a grant from the Government.\n“It has been a hard time for small independent cinemas due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n“The £8,940 grant will help this wonderful cinema financially and allow it to continue to show the latest films.”\nPart of Horton Road in Gloucester is shortly to be resurfaced. This is after a concerted campaign by the local county councillor, Jeremy Hilton.\nThe planned work is to be carried out at night between the 2nd and the 12th of October. The road will be closed between 7pm to 7am during the weekdays. It will not be closed on weekends.\nCllr. Jeremy Hilton (Kingsholm & Wotton) said:\n“I have been pressing the county council to resurface Horton Road for a long time. I am disappointed that only the stretch from London Road to the exit of the Aspen Medical Centre is to be resurfaced. The stretch from here to Great Western Road also needs doing.\n“There has been patching work, but Horton Road has needed a complete resurface.\n“This road is used by a lot of traffic and it’s breaking up in many places. The previous resurfacing wasn’t good enough. I am hoping this time the work will include strengthening the foundations.”\nThe county council is proposing to introduce an experimental traffic order from 2nd of November, which will close of Sweetbriar Street, Guinea Street and Union Street at school drop off and pick up times. Residents will always be able to get access as permits will be provided.\nThe ‘school streets’ project at Kingsholm Primary School is will operate for 18 months on a trial basis.\nIn principle, I support school streets as it will remove the hazard of cars parking around the school at these times and reduce the air pollution.\nFor many Kingsholm parents who walk their children to school it way may be beneficial, be safer and healthier for their children.\nParents from other parts of the city who drive their children to school will now have to park further away and walk their children to school.\nThe total budget for the school streets project that also incudes schools in Cheltenham and Tewkesbury is £100,000.\nThe county council is finalising documentation and it will be issuing advice about this project shortly.\nAt the weekend, Liberal Democrat group leader, Cllr. Jeremy Hilton wrote to Simon Roberts, the chief executive of Sainsbury’s about the proposed closure of their Northgate Street supermarket, which has been trading successfully for nearly 50 years.\nAlong with Lib Dem colleague Dr Rebecca Trimnell, Jeremy Hilton is raising an online petition, Save Our Sainsbury’s, which is doing well. Please sign it at:-\nI was shocked to learn this week that your company is to close its supermarket at Northgate Street, Gloucester after nearly 50 years of successful trading. Many people that I represent, who live in Kingsholm are very unhappy about the store’s closure as they use it regularly.\nMy Lib Dem colleague, Dr Rebecca Trimnell, who is campaigning for the residents of the city centre has raised an online petition to save the supermarket. The returns are good.\nI remember the store when it first opened as I had a Saturday job there as a teenager. I still shop in the store more than three times a week. Not only do residents of Kingsholm and city centre use it, but those working in the centre or other residents in Gloucester who are shopping in the city centre also pickup provisions before they go home.\nI imagine the store isn’t the strongest trading store, but it must still be profitable as the investment in the building will have been paid off long ago. I have noticed you have been running down the variety of stock, which may have hit trade a bit, but it’s Covid-19 pandemic that has had a major impact.\nHowever, trade is recoverable as we get through this pandemic. The city council is just about to invest in the refurbishment of Kings Square, which along with the regeneration around the bus and railway stations will bring in more people to the city centre. This will lead to an increase in footfall.\nIt would be so sad not to have a Sainsbury’s in the city centre while Tesco, Iceland and M&S will have a presence, but none of them can offer the same service and stock range that you can continue to do from Northgate Street.\nBoth Dr Rebecca Trimnell and I would appreciate meeting a senior representative of your company to discuss how we could keep the store open to mutual benefit.\nFinally, the city council will discuss a motion in my name about saving the store on the 24th of September.\nYours sincerely,\nCity Cllr. Jeremy Hilton\nLiberal Democrat Group Leader – Kingsholm & Wotton\nLoads of people are complaining about the changes to the Cheltenham Road and Estcourt Road roundabout. And rightly so. It is part of the new London Road cycle route, which in principle I support. I did walk the route with the cabinet member and engineers ahead of design work. However, we started from Denmark Road and walked towards the city centre. We didn’t visit the roundabout, which is a pity. As I would NOT have recommended it laid out as they suggested.\nI only got the published plans 40 minutes after a press release was issued. Despite my request 8 days before asking for the final plans. I was not happy. It’s when I got these plans that it became obvious the roundabout had been added to the scheme.\nThis project has been rushed through by the county council cabinet. The leader of the county council lives on Estcourt Road. Neighbouring Longlevens councillor Kathy Williams also serves in the cabinet.\nI am also currently backing residents on London Road who have lost their on-street parking spaces outside their homes with very short notice. I’m also unhappy with the removal of the pedestrian refuge outside Tesco. I’m OK with two new pedestrian crossings and the reworking of the England’s Glory crossing. The reworking of the buildout outside Healey Mews looks OK, but I await feedback from the residents who live there. I’m hoping the removal of the speed camera doesn’t see an increase in traffic speeds.\nProjects like this one need to be carefully considered, fully consulted on and professionally implemented. This hasn’t been done. I am told the roundabout scheme, which has only partly been implemented is under review and being revised. When I get the drawings I will post them on this website.",

He explained the contract looked like it was written by the supplier and had no exit clause.\n“I was shocked to hear that so much money has been paid over to the contractor with no-one in the Tory administration having the faintest idea what the payments were used for,” Councillor Hilton said.\n“The new cabinet member Richard Cook has described the contract as the worst he has ever seen.\n“He was unable to tell me what the payments were for when I questioned him at council.\n“The Tories were in charge when the contract was signed. This incompetence is unbelievable.”\nCouncillor Hilton added: “Gloucester is suffering from Tory austerity with important local services under threat from budget cuts, rising Council Tax bills and hard working council officers losing their jobs.\n“Yet the Tory administration has given Amey more than £500,000 and cannot explain what Council Tax payers in Gloucester have got back in return, beyond ‘bins’.”\nCouncillor Declan Wilson, deputy leader of Gloucester Lib Dems, added: “The problem of the mystery payments first came to light at the Audit Committee on January 23.\n“Every year £53,824 has been paid over for ‘bins’, but no-one is able to confirm what this annual sum as been used for.\n“This is incredible. For the Tory administration to hand over half a million pounds without fully understanding what it is for is astonishing.”",
  "http_jeremyhilton_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_jeremyhilton_mycouncillor_org_uk_page_9/content_404.html": "Gloucester Liberal Democrats have condemned the recent announcement by the Conservative controlled city council that charges for collecting garden waste are going up by 22%. Lib Dems have described the ‘garden waste tax’ as ‘daylight robbery’. They blame the Conservative council and government in equal proportion.\nThe current charge for garden waste collection is £36 per year. The charge was introduced in 2011 to cover the cost of collection on this non-statutory service. Lib Dems discovered in 2016 that the council was profiteering from the collection by around £6 per bin, making a profit of £110,000 a year. The Tories now propose to increase the charge to £44.\nLib Dem leader, Jeremy Hilton said: “Last year we tried to reduce the charge to £31 to just cover the cost of collection. Both Labour and Tory councillors rejected our proposal. Now the Conservatives plan to increase the charge to £44. This is a tax on responsible householders who recycle their garden waste. It’s daylight robbery.”\nLib Dem Deputy leader, Declan Wilson said: “The council’s finances are dire and the Tories are penalising responsible householders. We should be encouraging recycling not taxing it. The Tories will be making a profit of £13 on every green bin. This a profit margin of 30%. Local gardeners are going to have to empty their pockets to cover the financial mismanagement of the council by the Conservatives. It’s unfair.”\nLiberal Democrats call for more investment in Gloucester’s footways\nGloucester City Council on the 1st of December will debate the state of the city’s footways and the amount of money the Conservative led county council spends annually on resurfacing. The motion proposed by the Liberal Democrat group will call on the county council (the highway authority) to increase its capital footway budget from the £83,000 being spent this year.\nLiberal Democrat leader, Cllr. Jeremy Hilton said:\n“The state of many of the footways in Gloucester is shocking, in particular on our post-war housing estates and the older parts of the city. These footpaths are decades old and they need resurfacing rather than patching. The funds allocated by the Conservative run county council on resurfacing are inadequate. The county council must increase spending on footway repairs next year and beyond.”\nLiberal Democrats have been critical about the Tories who have recently agreed to spend a £1m on new telephones for Shire Hall and have given contractors UBB £30m in a cash gift to build the waste incinerator at Javelin Park. Money the Lib Dems say could have been better spend on repairing our roads and footpaths.\nCllr. Emily Ryall who will second the motion said:\n“It is unacceptable that the Conservative run county council do not see it as a priority to spend taxpayers’ money on ensuring that our pavements and footpaths are safe and fit for purpose. I have heard from residents in my ward of Elmbridge who struggle to manoeuvre wheelchairs, and have suffered twisted ankles and even head injuries from falling, due to uneven and broken surfaces. These residents deserve better.”\nEnds….\nMotion – poor maintenance of footways in Gloucester\n“This council expresses its deep concern about the state of many of the footways in Gloucester, noting that the county council has only budgeted to spend £83,000 from its capital budget on footways repairs within the city council boundaries this financial year.\nThis council notes that there are many footpaths, particularly on post-war housing estates, that are in desperate need of resurfacing.\nThis council therefore calls on Gloucestershire County Council to increase its capital spending on footway repairs within Gloucester for the 2017/18 council year and beyond.”\nProposed by Jeremy Hilton\nSeconded by Emily Ryall\nLiberals choose Linda Castle for the Longlevens By-election\nLocal resident Linda Castle has been selected by the Liberal Democrats to be its candidate in the Longlevens by-election.\nLinda has lived in Longlevens almost her whole life.\nThe married mother of two, who works as an IT trainer for the NHS, grew up in Longlevens, went to Longlevens infant, junior and secondary schools and raised her family in Longlevens.\nThe Longlevens by-election will be held on Thursday November 3 following the death of Conservative city councillor Jim Porter in August.\nLinda said: “I am so proud to be standing for election to represent Longlevens – the area where I grew up.\n“I know the area well and I am determined to speak up for Longlevens residents at the city council.\n“I am campaigning for improvements to our roads and pavements in Longlevens, which are in a mess due to inaction by the Conservatives at Shire Hall.\n“I am determined to make sure the proposals by the Boundary Commission to put Longlevens back into Gloucester are adopted.\n“I am also fighting to ensure that residents in Longlevens do not suffer from the effects of thousands of new homes being built on the outskirts of Gloucester, such as pressure on the local road network, doctors’ surgeries and schools.”\nAfter leaving school Linda worked for the CEGB in finance before joining the NHS.\nIn recent years Linda has been involved in the community campaign over the expansion of the Oxstalls campus and also wants to see the former Bishop’s College site retained for educational use.\nLinda was also treasurer of the Gloucester Dyslexia Association for four years. She is married to Ian, whose father was a Liberal councillor in Tewkesbury.\nShe was a member of a residents’ campaign group that opposed the expansion of the Oxstalls campus by the University of Gloucestershire. Linda also wants to see the Bishops’ College site retained for educational use.\nCouncillor Jeremy Hilton, leader of Gloucester Liberal Democrats, said: “Linda will make an excellent councillor for Longlevens on the city council.\n“She is a first class candidate and knows Longlevens very well having lived there for many years. She is full of enthusiasm and energy and is the breath of fresh air that Longlevens needs.\n“We’ve been speaking to residents and they are pleased that Linda is interested in hearing what they have to say.\n“Only Linda can beat the Conservatives in Longlevens and by supporting the Liberal Democrats on November 3, local residents can send a really strong message to the Conservatives in Gloucester that they have had enough of the way they run the city and county councils.\n“The Conservatives have run out of steam in Longlevens and Gloucester. Regeneration has stalled and our city is stagnating.”\nThe Siege of Gloucester (1643) the city can do more commemorate\nGloucester City Council (29 Sept) will debate how the city could better celebrate and remember the events of 1643, when the citizens of Gloucester defended the parliamentary garrison against the royalist forces during the first English Civil War. The Liberal Democrat group will propose the motion.\nFrom 10th August to 5th September 1643 the army of King Charles I besieged Gloucester. The city held out for just short of a month under the leadership of Colonel Massie until it was relieved by parliamentary troops under the command of the Earl of Essex. This was a pivotal turning point in the civil war.\nCllr. Jeremy Hilton who is to propose the motion said: “The revival of Gloucester Day and the parade is one way in which the city remembers the events of 1643 when our ancestors fought on the side of parliament. It was a crucial turning point in the English Civil War. We should be proud of this point in our history. Gloucester fought for parliament and democracy. That is why I am proposing that we set up a cross party working group to see how we can better remember and commemorate the Siege of Gloucester. We should consult the public as well.”\nThe seconder of the motion Cllr Joanne Brown said: “I well remember taking part in the first Gloucester Day parade of the modern era in 2009 and how it brought home to me the great spirit and strong will of the people of Gloucester who stood together during the siege of 1643. Today we can feel proud of the pivotal role our city played in changing the course of the Civil War and I believe that we can do even more to remember and commemorate the events of the siege.”\nEnds….\nText of the notice of motion\n“This council notes that Gloucester Day is a recently reinstated annual day of celebration of the city’s history and culture.\nGloucester Day was first held in the modern era on 5th September 2009, but originally dates from the lifting of the Siege of Gloucester in 1643, during which the city held out against royalist forces during the First English Civil War. The lifting of the siege was celebrated annually in the city for years afterwards but died out in the nineteenth century.\nThis council thanks the organisers of this year’s Gloucester Day celebrations and wishes them well in planning the 2017 celebrations.\nThis council also remembers the sacrifice and determination of the people of Gloucester as they defended the parliamentary garrison (10th August to 5th September 1643) against the besieging army of King Charles I. The siege ended with the arrival of a relieving parliamentary army under the Earl of Essex.\nThis council recognises that the Siege of Gloucester is one of the most important events in the history of this city of which we should all be proud and that we agree to set up a cross party working group to consider what else we can do to remember and commemorate the events of 1643.”\nProposed by Jeremy Hilton\nSeconded by Joanne Brown\nLonglevens set to return to Gloucester\nLonglevens will be represented by Gloucester’s MP if proposals by the Boundary Commission are approved.\nThe Liberal Democrats launched a petition earlier this year to show the strength of feeling that Longlevens should be represented by Gloucester’s MP rather than Tewkesbury’s.\nA couple of hundred local people signed the petition – both online and in the Lib Dem Spotlight newsletters – saying identified more with Gloucester than Tewkesbury.\nAmong the comments posted by people signing the petition on the change.org website, include: “This ludicrous situation has to change. Longlevens is part and parcel of GLOUCESTER, not Tewkesbury.”\nAnother said: “I live within the City of Gloucester and wish to be represented by the City MP. It makes no sense to be represented by a town MP 12 miles away.”\nToday the Boundary Commission, the independent agency that reviews Parliamentary boundaries, published its draft proposals to cut the number of MPs in England by 32 to 501.\nIn Gloucester, the Boundary Commission has proposed putting Longlevens back into Gloucester and moving the Quedgeley Fieldcourt and Quedgeley Severn Vale wards into the Stroud constituency.\nCouncillor Jeremy Hilton, the leader of Gloucester Liberal Democrat leader, said: “I am really pleased that the Boundary Commission is proposing to move Longlevens back into Gloucester.\n“Residents in Longlevens identify with Gloucester, so it is only right that local people are represented by the city’s MP.\n“I am also pleased the Boundary Commission has not resurrected previous plans to move the heart of Gloucester, including the cathedral and city centre, into the Forest of Dean.”\nMr Hilton said earlier this year the Conservatives had appeared lukewarm to his suggestion and comments about the Boundary Commission’s proposals supported that view.\n“In the summer Tewkesbury MP Laurence Robertson was against moving Longlevens back to Gloucester and Richard Graham was not bothered about reclaiming Longlevens,” he said.\n“The Liberal Democrats plan to make submissions to the Boundary Commission to ensure its initial proposals to include Longlevens are adopted. However, we will look closely at the south of the city and see if we can propose a solution that retains Quedgeley as well.”\nGloucester Lib Dems call for new ‘City Plan’ for Gloucester\nGloucester City Council is to debate a motion from the Liberal Democrat group, at council on Thursday. The Lib Dems are calling for a new City Plan for Gloucester, which will be an up to date set of polices that will become the development framework for Gloucester for the next few years.\nLib Dem leader, Cllr. Jeremy Hilton (Kingsholm & Wotton) said: “The last adopted development plan dates back to 1983. Its 33 years old and a lot has changed in Gloucester since then. Both Labour and Conservative administrations, in that time, have failed to get updates to the plan adopted as required by the government. We are asking the cabinet member for housing & planning to report back to council in September on how he intends to deliver a new City Plan. We want it adopted as a matter of urgency.”\nThe current timetable for approving the new City Plan was for it to be approved by council in time to go to the planning inspector in the winter of 2016 for adoption in 2017. Liberal Democrats are concerned that the delays in approving a new City Plan could allow a developers to override current polices arguing they are out of date, despite many being formally being ‘saved’ by the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government in 2007.\nCllr. David Brown (Hucclecote), Lib Dem spokesperson for housing & planning said: “The city council have a timetable to deliver the City Plan but due to the delay in adopting the Joint Core Strategy (JCS) it is now woefully outdated. We need the council to be able to work with developers from a position of strength, with a clear plan for the city, a plan that best benefits current and future residents. For that we need a City Plan that is fit for the future sooner rather than later.”\nThe new City Plan should be a development document that sits beneath the JCS. It must explain how the council will implement the spatial vision and strategic objectives in the JCS up to the year 2031 and provide criteria that it will apply when considering planning applications for different types of buildings or other development.\nWe should vote to remain- by Jeremy Hilton\nForty-one years ago I voted yes to stay in the Common Market. I intend to vote yes again on Thursday with a positive vote to REMAIN in the European Union. A union of 28 countries working together peacefully to sort out issues of cross border importance, such as trade, the environment and security.\nMy primary reason in voting yes in 1975 was to make sure that European countries sorted out their differences around a table and not on a battlefield. I wanted to live my life in peace. I have never regretted my decision. I have seen the Common Market of nine countries grow into the European Union of twenty-eight.\nIn 1975 the continent was split between western democracies and socialist dictatorships. Spain, Greece & Portugal were becoming democracies and joined the EU in the early 1980s. Now the EU has a population of 508 million living in peace with each other and with governments co-operating over issues that affect us all. As Winston Churchill said “Jaw Jaw is better than War War”.\nI have been concerned about the whole tone of the referendum campaign, particularly when I listen to those arguing to leave. I also think to myself; ‘I want my country back’. But, what I certainly don’t want is the UK run by a right wing clique of people who feed on people’s fears and concerns. Who stir up xenophobia and blame others for our problems.\nI grew up in a country that was proud of itself and was an open and free society, working with other nations within international organisations such as the UN, NATO, the Commonwealth and the EU. I believe that if we leave the EU it will be a step backwards. We could see our country fall apart with Scotland leaving the UK and “Little England” left just floating in the mid-Atlantic with few friends.\nAs individuals we would lose our right to live and work anywhere in the EU. Our European Health Insurance Card will become invalid. Many of us will suffer from loss of work or earnings. Taxes may rise. We shall probably experience years of regret that we isolated ourselves from our friends on the continent.\nI also want to address the nonsense espoused by leave campaigners that the EU is undemocratic, this is untrue. Every five years we elect MEP’s to represent us in the European Parliament, which amends and approves legalisation that the Council of Ministers’ support. The Council of Ministers includes an elected representative from every government. The European Commission acts in a similar way to our very own Civil Service.\nI hope that everyone will think very carefully about the way they are going to vote on Thursday. This is not the time to bash the Tory government, we can do that at the ballot box at the next general election. This is a time to vote for our children’s future. In my view it will be much better for them if we remain in the EU.\nRUSSIAN ROULETTE’ TUMBLE DRYERS NEED RECALLING, URGE FIRE AUTHORITIES\nDangerous tumble dryers prone to exploding into flames need recalling urgently to avoid people “playing Russian roulette” as new figures reveal firefighters are attending three fires a day caused by the appliances.\nThe Local Government Association (LGA), which represents 48 fire and rescue authorities in England and Wales, is calling on leading manufacturers to recall faulty tumble dryers which have been linked to thousands of fires caused by excess fluff contacting heating elements.\nGovernment statistics show there were 2,190 tumble dryer fires between 2012 and 2014 – equating to three a day.\nHomes have been ruined and in some cases, the machines have burst into flames as people loaded them with clothes. An inquest has opened into the deaths of two men who died after a tumble dryer caught fire.\nThe LGA is warning that companies who are running lengthy repair programmes for potentially dangerous machines, instead of recalling them, are risking the lives of millions of customers.\nIt is calling on manufacturers to recall affected tumble driers and for all white goods to have fire-proof markings on them, including the manufacturer, model and serial number, so they can be identified more easily if they are damaged after causing a fire.\nCllr Jeremy Hilton, Chair of the LGA’s Fire Services Management Committee, said:\n“People using faulty tumble dryers are unwittingly playing Russian roulette and leading manufacturers need to recall affected models as soon as possible to protect their customers.\n“Firefighters are attending tumble dryer fires three times a day, which is alarming. These defective products are endangering lives, causing thousands of pounds of damage to homes and making people homeless.\n“People’s safety must be the priority. It’s been months since some manufacturers issued safety warnings over their tumble dryers but they need to be recalled as these appliances are still causing fires – until they do so, consumers continue to risk falling victim to a devastating and tragic house fire.\n“Fire-proof markings on all white goods would also help improve manufacturing and safety standards by helping fire investigators identify the make and model of any appliance damaged after causing a fire.\n“Users must take simple precautions using tumble dryers. The compartment where fibres from fabric build up should be cleaned out after every load of clothes is dried, to reduce the risk of it igniting, and the vent or any other opening should not be covered.\n“People should never leave tumble driers on overnight or when they go out. Anyone buying an electrical item should complete the guarantee registration to ensure goods which do not meet safety specifications are repaired, replaced or refunded. This also enables manufacturers to contact owners in the event of a product recall.\n“People also need to ensure they have a working smoke alarm – which can be a life-saver – in the event something does go wrong and test them regularly, ideally once a week.”\nAnyone with concerns about the safety of electrical appliances can report them to the Citizens Advice consumer helpline on 03454 04 05 06.\nLiberal Democrats on city council announce spokespersons\nThe seven Liberal Democrats councillors on Gloucester City Council met at the weekend to elect their leader and deputy leader, plus other group positions.\nCllr. Jeremy Hilton (Kingsholm & Wotton) will remain the group leader and his deputy will be Cllr. Declan Wilson (Hucclecote).\nJeremy Hilton: “We have a magnificent group of seven councillors and it will be our job to provide constructive opposition to the Conservative administration. We have a group with four new members and we have lots of fresh ideas on how we can make Gloucester a better place. Regeneration, housing and the environment will be our priorities.”\nDeclan Wilson said: “Before the election we drew up an action plan for Gloucester with a dozen ideas to make Gloucester a better city. We intend to promote this agenda on the council. We shall oppose the Tories when it sensible to do so and work with the other groups when it is in the best interest of Gloucester.”\nEnds…\nGroup shadow spokespersons\n- Leader and Regeneration & Economy – Jeremy Hilton\n- Deputy Leader and Performance & Resources – Declan Wilson\n- Communities & Neighbourhoods – Howard Hyman\n- Environment – Isabel Brazil\n- Housing & Planning – David Brown\n- Culture & Leisure – Joanne Brown\n- Scrutiny – Emily Ryall\nGloucester Liberal Democrats – A dozen ideas for a better city\nGloucester Liberal Democrats have published their manifesto for the city council elections “A dozen ideas for a better city”. Currently the city council is controlled by the Conservatives, but the Liberal Democrats believe that the council could be run much better.\nLiberal Democrat leader, Cllr. Jeremy Hilton said: ”Services are not improving, budgets are being cut and we have had the first council tax rise in five years. The Tories are taxing responsible householders who recycle their garden waste by overcharging them for the garden waste collections. The Tory ‘Garden Tax’ adds £6 to the price of every green bin above what is needed to cover collection costs.\n“Regeneration in the city centre has stalled with the Kings Quarter project going nowhere. Its a shambles. The council administration needs to work much harder. We need to kick-start regeneration within the city centre. Kings Square has been unloved by the Conservatives and Labour for 25 years. We need to make this a great public space. We also need a new indoor market in a new location.\nThe last approved city plan for Gloucester dates back to the 1980s. We shall deliver a new city plan with policies to protect the environment, strengthen the economy and enhance the historic fabric of the city. We will do our best to encourage the building of more affordable homes to rent particularly within the social housing sector. We will also increase resources to defend council planning policies and decisions.”\n“There is so much to do and Liberal Democrats are up for the challenge.”\nA dozen ideas for a better city\n1. Market Parade or (White Friars) project\nWe will get this project started, which will include a new hotel, indoor market, city centre homes, car park and some retail. That is a true gateway into Gloucester, which is well linked to a refurbished railway station.\n2. Kings Square\nThis should be our premier open space in the city centre. It has been unloved by the council for 25 years. It must become a space for public events, dining and socialising, with (limited) new pavilion cafes, restaurants, and most of all, superb public art that pulls people to the square.\n3. Cathedral Quarter\nProject Pilgrim will help enhance the area around the cathedral, but we need to look at the whole of lower Westgate Street. How about refurbishing the small square outside Shire Hall or creating a visitors centre in Pitt Street, where the stone masons work keeping the cathedral in good condition?\n4. City Centre living\nWe must continue to support city centre living with new developments. The council must do more to encourage the conversion to housing of former office/commercial space within the city centre.\n5. City Centre environment\nThere are too many pound shops, turf accountants and tattoo parlours. We do need to improve our retail offer. There is no provision of high quality public toilets and this must be addressed. The pavements are littered with chewing gum and Liberal Democrats will invest in improving street cleaning in our city centre. The provision of public art in city centre is underwhelming.\n6. Regeneration Oversight\nRegeneration oversight is done behind closed doors and we propose to create a new Regeneration Scrutiny Committee to meet in public that can properly scrutinise the council’s regeneration plans. Lib Dems will bring Marketing Gloucester under tighter control by the city council.\n7. History\nWe live in a great historic city and we should promote this more effectively, with restoration of important buildings, festivals remembering our past & public art celebrating our 2,000 years of development. We would bring the new Culture Board under greater democratic control.\n8. University City\nWe must support the continued development of University of Gloucestershire in the city and encourage purpose built student accommodation in Blackfriars area to persuade year two and three students to stay in Gloucester rather than move to Cheltenham.\n9. Waste Collection\nLiberal Democrats will retain the current collection schedules and introduce recycling of cardboard and all plastics. We will scrap the Tories’ Garden Tax, placed on responsible householders who recycle their garden waste, by removing the surcharge for the collection of green wheelie bins.\n10. City Planning\nWe shall deliver a new city plan with policies to protect the environment, strengthen the economy and enhance the historic fabric of the city. We will do our best to encourage the building of more affordable homes to rent particularly within the social housing sector, despite the Tory government plans to ditch building new homes for rent. Lib Dems will invest extra resources in defending council planning polices and we will take necessary enforcement action against those who flout planning conditions.\n11. Homelessness\nWe shall focus on measures to reduce homelessness in the city. Working with partners, we will tackle drug and alcohol addiction, ensuring that homeless individuals with mental health issues get the support they deserve.\n12. Environment\nWe will crack down on dog fouling in parks, open spaces and on our streets. We will enhance our public parks and improve children’s play facilities. Liberal Democrats will remove the tacky advertising boards that the Tories installed that are now blighting our roundabouts.",

Since the Coalition was formed, we have had to cut spending on benefits and some services though we have protected schools and the NHS.\n“As a local councillor in Gloucester it has been hard for me and my colleagues to make savings in the council budget whilst maintaining the services people pay for.\n“But Lib Dems in Government have also increased taxes on the wealthiest whilst cutting income tax for people on low and middle incomes. This would not have happened if the Conservatives had won a majority at the last General Election and formed a single party Government.\n“Now the Conservatives have announced if they win the election, they will complete the job of balancing the books entirely on the backs of the working age poor.

If they form a single party Government after the election, they will put back the date when the books are balanced, leaving Britain in more unnecessary debt.\n“Liberal Democrats have announced that we will take a fairer, balanced approach to wiping out the deficit. There will need to be further cuts, including £4 billion on benefits, but we will be raising £6 billion by tackling tax avoidance and £8 billion in increased taxes on the wealthiest and big business.

  "http_jeremyhilton_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_jeremyhilton_mycouncillor_org_uk_category_city-council_page_2/content_74.html": "Redrow Homes has appealed to the Secretary of State about Gloucester City Council’s non-determination of their planning application to build 89 dwellings on the former Civil Service Sports Ground off Estcourt Road. Application reference 16/00968/FUL.\nThis controversial application raised many objections from local residents when it was originally deposited with the council in 2016.\nThe deadline for comments to the Planning Inspectorate from the public was the 9th of August this year. Jeremy Hilton’s letter is below.\nGloucester City Council has still to respond. Within a few weeks the council will take its response to the planning committee for approval, before it is sent to the Planning Inspectorate.\nJeremy Hilton fighting to save the Civil Service Sports Ground\nJeremy Hilton’s Letter to Planning Inspectorate\nI write to ask you to dismiss the appeal by Redrow Homes related to the planning application for 89 houses on the former Civil Service Sports Club ground (Ref:16/00968/FUL).\nI am the local county and city councillor for Kingsholm & Wotton.\nOn the 19th of April 2017, I did write to the case officer at Gloucester City Council pointing out that the application was then seven months old and that it should be determined with a recommendation to refuse.\nThe council said they were giving more time to Redrow to resolve the issue about the loss of sports pitches. Redrow had not in April 2017 nor since provided evidence on how they would mitigate for the loss of the playing fields.\nThere is a shortage of rugby and football pitches in Gloucester. Spartans Ruby Club, which is based in Kingsholm, is looking for an additional pitch near to its club house, which is in neighbouring Sherborne Street.\nThe High School for Girls, which is in Denmark Road has also spoken to me about possible use of the sports field if it is saved from development.\nAll Redrow have done since acquiring the site in 2011 (for just £10,000) is shut the gates and demolish the club house etc, making the facilities unavailable for active sport that it had previously been used for.\nSimilarly, since acquiring the site Redrow have failed to properly discuss the future of the playing fields with the local community that is required in the Joint Core Strategy policy INF4. The lack of community engagement is lamentable.\nRedrow’s idea of consultation has been to lodge two full planning applications with the council, leaving no opportunity for the council or the community to hold discussions about how the site could be developed for some housing, but leaving the rest of the site available for sport and recreation.\nAs Keith Annis a senior manager at Redrow once told me they were playing for time. The question must be asked why has it taken them nearly two years from depositing the planning application to lodge an appeal?\nFor Redrow to appeal against non-determination is rather hypocritical, particularly to do this only a few weeks after lodging a new planning application for 100 dwellings on the same site (Ref 18/00306/FUL)\nFurther Comments\nA. Affordable housing:\nThe plan for affordable homes did not meet the council’s then standard, when the application was submitted, which was 40 %. The application lists 18 dwellings as intermediate housing, this is equates to 20% of the build.\nIt was impossible for the council to approve an application that did not meet this standard. Subsequently, the Joint Core Strategy has been adopted, where the new limit is set at 20%.\nB. Land Purchase:\nThe applicants purchased the sports ground from the Civil Service Sports Council Ltd for just £10,000 in 2011 (GR355501). The applicants should publicly declare the details of the uplift clause they have with Civil Service Sports Council Ltd.\nI believe it is this legal agreement that is responsible for the maximisation of housing on the site rather than what one would expect an open discussion with the council and community on a development brief that would benefit all.\nSome degree of housing whilst retaining the main sports field for sport and recreation, would benefit everyone.\nC. Alternative sport provision:\nIt may be that the land has not been used for sport for more than five years, but that is because of a deliberate policy by the landowners to close the ground for sporting activities.\nI concur with Sport England that the application should be refused.\nThe applicants have failed to identify alternative facilities that could accommodate sporting activities that previously took place on the Civil Service Sports ground.\nIn my opinion, alternative provision must be within the Kingsholm & Wotton ward.\nD. Joint Core Strategy INF3\nThe proposed development of 89 dwellings in my opinion is not consistent with JCS policy on green infrastructure. The former Civil Service Sport Ground provides a worthy green infrastructure asset that should be protected to help resolve the shortage of open space in Kingsholm and Wotton.\nI believe it is not beyond the wit of all parties to come up with a development solution that would provide much needed housing whilst retaining a large open space that could continue to be used for sport and recreation.\nHere is Policy INF3\n1. The green infrastructure network of local and strategic importance will be conserved and enhanced, in order to deliver a series of multifunctional, linked green corridors across the JCS area by:\ni. Improving the quantity and/or quality of assets;\nii. Improving linkages between assets in a manner appropriate to the scale of development, and\niii. Designing improvements in a way that supports the cohesive management of green\ninfrastructure;\n2. Development proposals should consider and contribute positively towards green infrastructure, including the wider landscape context and strategic corridors between major assets and populations. Where new residential development will create, or add to, a need for publicly accessible green space or outdoor space for sports and recreational on, this will be fully met in accordance with Policy INF4. Development at Strategic Alloca ons will be required to deliver connectivity through the site, linking urban areas with the wider rural hinterland\n3. Existing green infrastructure will be protected in a manner that reflects its contribution\nto ecosystem services (including biodiversity, landscape / townscape quality, the historic environment, public access, recreation and play) and the connectivity of the green infrastructure network. Development proposals that will have an impact on woodlands, hedges and trees will need to include a jus ca on for why this impact cannot be avoided and should incorporate measures acceptable to the Local Planning Authority to mi gate the loss. Mi ga on should be provided on-site or, where this is not possible, in the immediate environs of the site\n4. Where assets are created, retained or replaced within a scheme, they should be properly integrated into the design and contribute to local character and distinctiveness. Proposals should also make provisions for future maintenance of green infrastructure.\nE. Joint Core Strategy INF4\nAs I have previously mentioned the lack of serious community engagement by Redrow ahead of this planning application, about the future use of the site, is lamentable.\nRedrow have only showed plans that have proposed the complete building on the site, with the loss of the playing fields. They have never properly consulted anyone.\nI believe they failed to meet the requirement of Joint Core Strategy policy INF4 for social and community infrastructure\nHere is Policy INF4\n1. Proposals to develop land or buildings currently or previously in use as a community facility will demonstrate, including evidence of engagement with relevant local community groups and partner organisations, why the facility is no longer required and, as appropriate, how, when and where suitable local replacement facilities will be provided. Provision of replacement facilities will have regard to the locational and other relevant elements of this policy\n2. Where new residential development will create, or add to, a need for community facilities, it will be fully met as on-site provision and/or as a contribution to facilities or services o -site. New or refurbished provision will be of an appropriate type, standard and size. From an early stage, developers will be expected to engage with the relevant local authorities and infrastructure providers and, as appropriate, relevant local community groups where they exist, to ensure that new provision meets the needs of the community that it will serve and is t for purpose\n3. Social and community infrastructure should be centrally located to the population it serves and\nbe easily accessible on foot and by bicycle. It should be located so as to have the potential to be well-served by public transport. Developers should aim to provide flexible, multifunctional facilities within mixed-use developments, creating shared space which maximises benefits to the community and minimises land-take. In the case of open space, ‘easily accessible’ means it is located within reasonable walking distance of the development it serves. New facilities should be accessible to all members of the community, and be planned and phased in parallel with new development.\nF. Draft City Plan Policy SA06\nThe provision of 89 dwellings is in my opinion is overdevelopment of the site, which is in the heart of Kingsholm.\nCouncil policy as identified in the draft City Plan, which was approved by council in December 2016, recommends a maximum of twenty dwellings (SA06).\nThe proposal of 89 dwellings exceeds this policy by 445%, with the complete loss of the playing fields.\nA compromise of 40 dwellings, for example, on this site would mean that the former sports field could be brought back into use.\nG. Layout of the site:\nThe layout of the site does not follow the usual street pattern that is evident in Kingsholm. It is adjacent to both the Kingsholm and Denmark Road conservation areas.\nI am concerned that the narrow streets on estate may be become clogged up with motorists parking their cars on footpaths. This is a problem that will be exacerbated during times when there are rugby matches being played at the Kingsholm stadium.\nThe small public open space is set out to give the impression that it is an exclusive space just for the new residents of the estate. New public open space should laid out to be inclusive and available to all Kingsholm residents.\nH. Highway access:\nI am not convinced by the design of the access point onto Estcourt Road slip road.\nThe proposed access onto Denmark Road is unacceptable. It closes the slip road to Lansdown Road and removes much-needed parking spaces on Denmark Road.\nThe closure of the slip road will create more vehicle conflict at the other junction with Lansdown Road. This will be a particular problem when school coaches use this junction.\nThe closure of the slip road will also remove the u-turn provision it provides for the houses serviced off the dual carriageway section of Denmark Road on the south side.\nI. Public open space:\nKingsholm & Wotton has a low level of public open space as identified in the city council’s open spaces strategy. The council’s standard is 2.8ha per 1000\nBased on the new ward boundaries introduced at the 2016 election the ward has just 0.49ha per 1,000 population. Or 3.59ha for a population based on mid 2016 of 7,259 persons.\nAn opportunity is being missed in the proposed development to achieve a good increase in public open space provision in the ward by the wholesale development of the site, which was formerly used for sport and recreation.\nI would recommend that this appeal is dismissed.",

There is much concern about the number of homes now being converted into Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMO).\nCurrently, family homes converted into HMOs for six persons or fewer do not require planning permission, as it is permitted development.\nFamily homes are being converted into properties suitable for renting and this can lead to issues with noise, rubbish and parking.\nThere can also be problems with getting landlords to deal with incidents of anti-social behaviour.\nEarlier this year Jeremy Hilton and Isabel Brazil tried to amend the council’s work plan to start on the survey work, which is required as precursor to getting an Article 4 Direction.

Hilton believes this to be inconsistent with the planning committee’s decision on the 4th December when it rejected the application for 89 properties on the same site. The planning committee are meeting on Tuesday the 8th of January at 6pm to determine the application for 100 houses.\nJeremy Hilton has listed ten reasons why the application should be rejected. Here are his objections in full.\nA. Housing Types:\nThe development meets the 20% affordable homes target, with appropriate mix of housing types, but it does not meet the requirement for market housing mix, with no provision for one or two bedroom homes. Kingsholm & Wotton has a good mix of housing and so should any new development in the ward. The applicant proposes 31 three bedroom houses and 49 four bedroom houses. The mix according to SHMA should be 9 one bedroom homes, 23 two bedroom homes, 30 three bedroom homes and 18 four bedroom homes. Rejection on this policy alone would be consistent with the committee decision on the 89 house application.\nB. Land Purchase:\nThe applicants purchased the sports ground from the Civil Service Sports Council Ltd for just £10,000 in 2011 (GR355501). The applicants should publicly declare the details of the uplift clause they have with Civil Service Sports Council Ltd.\nI believe it is this legal agreement that is responsible for the maximisation of housing on the site rather than what one would expect in open discussion with the council and community on a development brief that would benefit all. Some degree of housing whilst retaining the main sports field for sport and recreation, would benefit everyone.\nC. Alternative sport provision:\nIt may be that the land has not been used for sport for more than five years, but that is because of a deliberate policy by the landowners to close the ground for sporting activities.\nI am disappointed that Sport England have changed their objection to the development. I don’t think a cash gift from Redrow of £2m to the city council to be spent elsewhere in Gloucester on sports provision adequately compensates for the loss of the playing fields that are in the heart of Kingsholm.\nThe applicant has been unable to identify alternative provision elsewhere in Kingsholm & Wotton and therefore some sports provision should be retained on site. Spartans Rugby Club that is based in Sherborne Street would support the provision here for an additional rugby pitch for the club to use.\nD. Joint Core Strategy INF3\nThe proposed development of 100 dwellings in my opinion is not consistent with JCS policy on green infrastructure. The former Civil Service Sport Ground provides a worthy green infrastructure asset that should be protected to help resolve the shortage of open space in Kingsholm and Wotton.\nI believe it is not beyond the wit of Redrow Homes to come up with a development solution that would provide much needed housing whilst retaining a large open space that could continue to be used for sport and recreation.\nThe impact on the biodiversity from the wholesale building on the site will be negative. Two badger sets as indicated in the report will disappear if the development proceeds. Trees will be felled. The report also states that the development will create the loss of a foraging area for bats.\nThe proposed tiny public open space is tucked away in the corner of the site giving the impression that it is an exclusive space for residents of the estate rather than one that is inclusive for everyone living in Kingsholm to use. A large percentage of the public open space is set out as a flood attenuation basin, making the space practicably unusable for recreational purposes.\nHere is Policy INF3\n- The green infrastructure network of local and strategic importance will be conserved and enhanced, in order to deliver a series of multifunctional, linked green corridors across the JCS area by:\ni. Improving the quantity and/or quality of assets;\nii. Improving linkages between assets in a manner appropriate to the scale of development, and\niii. Designing improvements in a way that supports the cohesive management of green\ninfrastructure; - Development proposals should consider and contribute positively towards green infrastructure, including the wider landscape context and strategic corridors between major assets and populations. Where new residential development will create, or add to, a need for publicly accessible green space or outdoor space for sports and recreational on, this will be fully met in accordance with Policy INF4. Development at Strategic Allocations will be required to deliver connectivity through the site, linking urban areas with the wider rural hinterland\n- Existing green infrastructure will be protected in a manner that reflects its contribution\nto ecosystem services (including biodiversity, landscape/townscape quality, the historic environment, public access, recreation and play) and the connectivity of the green infrastructure network. Development proposals that will have an impact on woodlands, hedges and trees will need to include a justification for why this impact cannot be avoided and should incorporate measures acceptable to the Local Planning Authority to mitigate the loss. Mitigation should be provided on-site or, where this is not possible, in the immediate environs of the site - Where assets are created, retained or replaced within a scheme, they should be properly integrated into the design and contribute to local character and distinctiveness. Proposals should also make provisions for future maintenance of green infrastructure.\nE. Joint Core Strategy INF4\nThe lack of serious community engagement by Redrow ahead of this planning application, about the future use of the site, is lamentable. They locked the gates and closed down the sporting use, even though it was a well used facility.\nRedrow have only presented plans that have proposed the complete building on the site, with the total loss of the playing fields. They have never properly consulted with anyone who lives in Kingsholm.\nThe proposal for provide £148,784.31 towards the Sebert Street Recreation Ground play area has NOT been discussed with the community. This is currently one of the best play areas in the city that was created by the parents of Kingsholm Kids at Play. I am concerned about possible overdevelopment of the Sebert Street Recreational Ground as proposed in the officer’s report. What about Deans Way Meadow? Why is there no onsite provision?\nThere is no clarity in the officer recommendations on what the Section 106 financial agreement will be and what positive impact these will have on the local community.\nI believe Redrow have failed to meet the requirement of Joint Core Strategy policy INF4 for social and community infrastructure\nHere is Policy INF4\n- Proposals to develop land or buildings currently or previously in use as a community facility will demonstrate, including evidence of engagement with relevant local community groups and partner organisations, why the facility is no longer required and, as appropriate, how, when and where suitable local replacement facilities will be provided. Provision of replacement facilities will have regard to the locational and other relevant elements of this policy\n- Where new residential development will create, or add to, a need for community facilities, it will be fully met as on-site provision and/or as a contribution to facilities or services onsite. New or refurbished provision will be of an appropriate type, standard and size. From an early stage, developers will be expected to engage with the relevant local authorities and infrastructure providers and, as appropriate, relevant local community groups where they exist, to ensure that new provision meets the needs of the community that it will serve and is t for purpose\n- Social and community infrastructure should be centrally located to the population it serves and\nbe easily accessible on foot and by bicycle. It should be located so as to have the potential to be well-served by public transport. Developers should aim to provide flexible, multifunctional facilities within mixed-use developments, creating shared space which maximises benefits to the community and minimises land-take. In the case of open space, ‘easily accessible’ means it is located within reasonable walking distance of the development it serves. New facilities should be accessible to all members of the community, and be planned and phased in parallel with new development.\nF. Joint Core Strategy INF6\nThis development, as did the one for 89 houses, fails to meet the requirement of this policy. The site will increase carbon emissions rather than reduce them with large increase of vehicles into the area around Denmark Road. It will reduce the opportunity to improve the health of local people in the area by reducing the local opportunity for sport and recreation for residents of Kingsholm.\nKingsholm Primary School, which is a vibrant and popular school has expressed concern about their ability to cope with the additional children going to the school and the possible detriment to children from traveller families, who may no longer be able to get it.\nHere is Policy INF6\n- Where infrastructure requirements are generated as a result of individual site proposals and / or having regard to cumulative impact, new development will be served and supported by adequate and appropriate on- and / or off-site infrastructure and services. In identifying infrastructure requirements, development proposals will also demonstrate that full regard has been given, where appropriate, to implementing the requirements of the Joint Core Strategy Infrastructure Delivery Plan\n- Where need for additional infrastructure and services and / or impacts on existing infrastructure and services is expected to arise, the Local Planning Authority will seek to secure appropriate infrastructure which is necessary, directly related, and fairly and reasonably related to the scale and kind of the development proposal, including:\n- Broadband infrastructure\n- Climate change mitigation/adaptation;\n- Community and cultural facilities and initiatives;\n- Early Years and Education;\n- Health and well-being facilities and sport, recreation and leisure facilities;\n- The highway network, traffic management, sustainable transport and disabled people’s access;\n- Protection of cultural and heritage assets and the potential for their enhancement;\n- Protection of environmental assets and the potential for their enhancement;\n- Provision of Green Infrastructure including open space;\n- Public realm;\n- Safety and security including emergency services.\n3. Priority for provision will be assessed both on a site-by-site basis and having regard to the mitigation of cumulative impact, together with implementation of the JCS Infrastructure Delivery Plan\n4. Planning permission will be granted only where sufficient provision has been made for infrastructure and services (together with their continued maintenance) to meet the needs of new development and / or which are required to mitigate the impact of new development upon existing communities. Infrastructure and services must be provided in line with an agreed, phased timescale and in accordance with other requirements of this Plan.\nG. Draft City Plan Policy SA06\nThe provision of 100 dwellings is in my opinion is overdevelopment of the site, which is in the heart of Kingsholm. Council policy as identified in the draft City Plan, which was approved by council in December 2016, recommends a maximum of 20 dwellings (SA06).\nThe proposal of 100 dwellings exceeds this policy by 500%, with the complete loss of the playing fields.\nA compromise of 40 dwellings, for example, on this site would mean that the former sports field could be brought back into use\nH. Layout of the site:\nThe layout of the site does not follow the usual street pattern that is evident in Kingsholm. It is adjacent to both the Kingsholm and Denmark Road conservation areas.\nI am concerned that the narrow streets on estate may become clogged up with motorists parking their cars on footpaths. This is a problem that will be exacerbated during times when there are rugby matches being played at the Kingsholm stadium.\nIf 89 houses was an overdevelopment of the site as mentioned in the minutes of the December meeting then surely 100 houses is more so. There is still concern about the closeness of houses next to Bijou Court. There are a few areas where the relationships are below 21 metres separation, a concern raised by the planning officer.\nI. Highway access:\nThe proposed access onto Denmark Road is unacceptable. It closes the slip road to Lansdown Road and removes much-needed parking spaces on Denmark Road.\nThe closure of the slip road will create more vehicle conflict at the other junction with Lansdown Road. This will be a particular problem when school coaches use this junction. Parents often park illegally on double yellow lines at this point. The problem will become much worse.\nThe closure of the slip road will also remove the U-turn provision it provides for the houses serviced off the dual carriageway section of Denmark Road on the south side.\nJ. Public open space:\nKingsholm & Wotton has a low level of public open space as identified in the city council’s open spaces strategy. The officer report confirms this to be the case. The council’s public open space standard is 2.8ha per 1000 population.\nBased on the new ward boundaries introduced at the 2016 election the ward has just 0.49ha per 1,000 population. Or 3.59ha for a population based on mid 2016 of 7,259 persons.\nAn opportunity is being missed in the proposed development to achieve a good increase in public open space provision in the ward because of the wholesale development of the site.\nI back you 100%. Me & members of my skittle team were devasted when we had our venue taken away. Many family parties etc were had there & lovely memories made! We were told it wasn’t making money but it was always full of sports people etc when we went!\nWe’re told that Cheltenham civil service was being kept but it was a known fact it was not being used or profitable!\ni thought it was all wrong when it happened, it upset a lot of people & clubs.\nIt was only over time that this was going to happen , I’m sure it was planned this way!\nThey were hoping nearby residents would complain that it was over run or unkempt. The purchase price was a joke! I wish I’d had the chance to buy it! Never saw it for sale anywhere! So underhanded.\nMy thoughts go out to you & hope it gets stopped.\nOn my understanding there was a clause to say in whatever whether a will or purchase stipulation that it was to be used for the community.\nI may have been misinformed but that is what I was led to believe.\nBest wishes\nTotally agree with your remarks. The loss of open space in the area is a disgrace.\nThe planning should not be allowed to go ahead. Retention of the playing area should be a priority.\nThis is a ridiculous proposal which will severely impact traffic and therefore, safety to pedestrians round Denmark road. It will reduce outdoor space for residents of the area and is just not necessary when the schools could not cope with additional pupils.\nThis should not be allowed to take place.\nCan see no benefit to the community!",

One of the roads most affected by the loss of family homes being converted into Houses in Multiple Occupation\nA promised housing stock survey in Kingsholm has been delayed yet again by council red-tape. The latest excuse was provided by the Conservative cabinet member in a written answer to a question from Lib Dem councillor for Kingsholm, Cllr. Jeremy Hilton.\nThe survey is planned so that the council can provide definitive evidence that too many family homes in Kingsholm are being converted into Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMO).\nA 130-signature petition was handed into the cabinet by Jeremy Hilton in November 2020.\nThe Petition said:\n“Too many family homes in Kingsholm are being converted into Houses in Multiple Occupation, without planning permission being required. It is currently permitted development for six persons or less.\nI/We the undersigned demand that the city council starts work immediately on preparing evidence and documentation to apply to the Secretary of State to give Kingsholm the protection of an Article 4 Direction. This means that all conversions of family homes into Houses in Multiple Occupation would require planning permission.”\nCllr. Jeremy Hilton said:\n“Lib Dems tried to amend the council plan in July 2020 to get the work started on a housing stock survey, but the Conservatives voted it down.\n“That is why I raised an online petition to get public support. I handed it in at the November 2020 cabinet.\n“Shortly afterwards, I met officers who suggested we schedule the survey work for April this year. Then it was delayed until the summer to be part of a countywide housing survey.\n“Now the Cabinet Member for Planning and Housing Strategy says there have been delays because of legal queries and the tender documents haven’t been issued. It is ridiculous, the word incompetence comes to mind.\nThe written question and the answer published in the council papers of the 23rd of September 2021\n“Kingsholm residents are frustrated by the Conservative council’s reluctance to treat Kingsholm as a special case. We see the onward creep of Houses in Multiple Occupation and the damage done to the community. Parking, noise and litter all contribute to the degradation of our once-quiet streets.”\nJeremy Hilton concluded:\n“It is very frustrating trying to get projects implemented at the city council. We are given dates, then later dates and then sometime never. The Conservatives have cut back so far, nothing seems to get done on time. The council has accurately been described as the ‘vanishing council’.\n“This housing stock survey is critical in getting our planning rules toughened up to protect Kingsholm’s family homes. It cannot be delayed further by red-tape or more accurately blue-tape.”",

Financial control under the Tories is a disaster; we must sort out the finances of the city council for the sake of the council’s reputation.”\n“The Tories are proposing £2.4 million worth of cuts with just 75 words of explanation across sixteen budget headings. Information on the proposed budget is palpable. The announcement of the capital programme for next year is delayed and money in reserves is not being made public.”\nLiberal Democrat deputy leader, Sebastian Field confirmed that his party would work with other councillors to sort out the council’s financial affairs, he said: “The financial situation on Gloucester City Council is dire.

The Liberal Democrat group will propose the motion.\nFrom 10th August to 5th September 1643 the army of King Charles I besieged Gloucester. The city held out for just short of a month under the leadership of Colonel Massie until it was relieved by parliamentary troops under the command of the Earl of Essex. This was a pivotal turning point in the civil war.\nCllr. Jeremy Hilton who is to propose the motion said: “The revival of Gloucester Day and the parade is one way in which the city remembers the events of 1643 when our ancestors fought on the side of parliament. It was a crucial turning point in the English Civil War. We should be proud of this point in our history. Gloucester fought for parliament and democracy. That is why I am proposing that we set up a cross party working group to see how we can better remember and commemorate the Siege of Gloucester. We should consult the public as well.”\nThe seconder of the motion Cllr Joanne Brown said: “I well remember taking part in the first Gloucester Day parade of the modern era in 2009 and how it brought home to me the great spirit and strong will of the people of Gloucester who stood together during the siege of 1643. Today we can feel proud of the pivotal role our city played in changing the course of the Civil War and I believe that we can do even more to remember and commemorate the events of the siege.”\nEnds….\nText of the notice of motion\n“This council notes that Gloucester Day is a recently reinstated annual day of celebration of the city’s history and culture.\nGloucester Day was first held in the modern era on 5th September 2009, but originally dates from the lifting of the Siege of Gloucester in 1643, during which the city held out against royalist forces during the First English Civil War. The lifting of the siege was celebrated annually in the city for years afterwards but died out in the nineteenth century.\nThis council thanks the organisers of this year’s Gloucester Day celebrations and wishes them well in planning the 2017 celebrations.\nThis council also remembers the sacrifice and determination of the people of Gloucester as they defended the parliamentary garrison (10th August to 5th September 1643) against the besieging army of King Charles I. The siege ended with the arrival of a relieving parliamentary army under the Earl of Essex.\nThis council recognises that the Siege of Gloucester is one of the most important events in the history of this city of which we should all be proud and that we agree to set up a cross party working group to consider what else we can do to remember and commemorate the events of 1643.”\nProposed by Jeremy Hilton\nSeconded by Joanne Brown",

This will take vehicle data to establish the occupancy, parking stress and demand on an area as well as duration of stay and generally how far people have travelled to park, i.e. are they local to area, the street, city or come further away.\nThe survey will take place over a week, picking two or three days that week and carrying out the surveys three times a day. The results of the traffic survey will take a month to come back. Afterwards, an informal consultation will be done from March to May with residents and businesses.\nLocal Lib Dem councillors Jeremy Hilton and Isabel Brazil are pleased that work on the review is starting. They have received loads of complaints from residents about parking congestion in Kingsholm. They have passed on several emails to the traffic manager about parking problems.\nCllr. Jeremy Hilton said:\n“The streets in Kingsholm are overloaded with commuters parking in residential streets leaving little space during the daytime for residents to park up near to their home. There many properties in the ward which do not have off street parking.\n“The survey area will consider most streets in Kingsholm. Hopefully, at the end of the project we will have parking regulations that are fit for purpose.”\nCllr. Isabel Brazil said:\n“Parking congestion in Kingsholm is a problem. We do encourage residents to write to us and we shall pass all comments onto the parking manager to form part of the evidence.”\nTimetable\n- Informal consultation with residents – March to May\n- Statutory consultation – June to July\n- Formal Advertising preparation – June to July\n- Formal advertising responses – July to August\n- Traffic order amendments – Sept\n- Traffic Regulation Order sign off – Oct\n- Making Traffic Regulation Order – Nov\n- Implementation work – Nov\nWe have waited over 20 years for this to be sorted out.

The square on street parking gets filled each day by workers leaving their cars for the day leaving very few for the residents. I would welcome a resident permit scheme to be introduced.\nWe are residents of Henry Road for 30 years and whilst we appreciate that parking has become an issue we feel that imposing a parking charge is basically a back handed way of imposing another tax on us. Whilst parking requires a little bit of patience parking outside our home is not necessary and will not necessarily be improved by parking permits. We also feel that relatives and friends who come to visit us will be charged and limited for the privilege which is not the case for most other areas in Gloucester. We feel that if the council provided cheap easily accessible parking for hospital staff and people working in Gloucester centre this situation would not arise. Why should the residents of Kingsholm be penalised for where they have chosen to live most of us for many years.",
  "http_jeremyhilton_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_jeremyhilton_mycouncillor_org_uk_category_planning/content_47.html": "Redrow Homes has appealed to the Secretary of State about Gloucester City Council’s non-determination of their planning application to build 89 dwellings on the former Civil Service Sports Ground off Estcourt Road. Application reference 16/00968/FUL.\nThis controversial application raised many objections from local residents when it was originally deposited with the council in 2016.\nThe deadline for comments to the Planning Inspectorate from the public was the 9th of August this year. Jeremy Hilton’s letter is below.\nGloucester City Council has still to respond. Within a few weeks the council will take its response to the planning committee for approval, before it is sent to the Planning Inspectorate.\nJeremy Hilton fighting to save the Civil Service Sports Ground\nJeremy Hilton’s Letter to Planning Inspectorate\nI write to ask you to dismiss the appeal by Redrow Homes related to the planning application for 89 houses on the former Civil Service Sports Club ground (Ref:16/00968/FUL).\nI am the local county and city councillor for Kingsholm & Wotton.\nOn the 19th of April 2017, I did write to the case officer at Gloucester City Council pointing out that the application was then seven months old and that it should be determined with a recommendation to refuse.\nThe council said they were giving more time to Redrow to resolve the issue about the loss of sports pitches. Redrow had not in April 2017 nor since provided evidence on how they would mitigate for the loss of the playing fields.\nThere is a shortage of rugby and football pitches in Gloucester. Spartans Ruby Club, which is based in Kingsholm, is looking for an additional pitch near to its club house, which is in neighbouring Sherborne Street.\nThe High School for Girls, which is in Denmark Road has also spoken to me about possible use of the sports field if it is saved from development.\nAll Redrow have done since acquiring the site in 2011 (for just £10,000) is shut the gates and demolish the club house etc, making the facilities unavailable for active sport that it had previously been used for.\nSimilarly, since acquiring the site Redrow have failed to properly discuss the future of the playing fields with the local community that is required in the Joint Core Strategy policy INF4. The lack of community engagement is lamentable.\nRedrow’s idea of consultation has been to lodge two full planning applications with the council, leaving no opportunity for the council or the community to hold discussions about how the site could be developed for some housing, but leaving the rest of the site available for sport and recreation.\nAs Keith Annis a senior manager at Redrow once told me they were playing for time. The question must be asked why has it taken them nearly two years from depositing the planning application to lodge an appeal?\nFor Redrow to appeal against non-determination is rather hypocritical, particularly to do this only a few weeks after lodging a new planning application for 100 dwellings on the same site (Ref 18/00306/FUL)\nFurther Comments\nA. Affordable housing:\nThe plan for affordable homes did not meet the council’s then standard, when the application was submitted, which was 40 %. The application lists 18 dwellings as intermediate housing, this is equates to 20% of the build.\nIt was impossible for the council to approve an application that did not meet this standard. Subsequently, the Joint Core Strategy has been adopted, where the new limit is set at 20%.\nB. Land Purchase:\nThe applicants purchased the sports ground from the Civil Service Sports Council Ltd for just £10,000 in 2011 (GR355501). The applicants should publicly declare the details of the uplift clause they have with Civil Service Sports Council Ltd.\nI believe it is this legal agreement that is responsible for the maximisation of housing on the site rather than what one would expect an open discussion with the council and community on a development brief that would benefit all.\nSome degree of housing whilst retaining the main sports field for sport and recreation, would benefit everyone.\nC. Alternative sport provision:\nIt may be that the land has not been used for sport for more than five years, but that is because of a deliberate policy by the landowners to close the ground for sporting activities.\nI concur with Sport England that the application should be refused.\nThe applicants have failed to identify alternative facilities that could accommodate sporting activities that previously took place on the Civil Service Sports ground.\nIn my opinion, alternative provision must be within the Kingsholm & Wotton ward.\nD. Joint Core Strategy INF3\nThe proposed development of 89 dwellings in my opinion is not consistent with JCS policy on green infrastructure. The former Civil Service Sport Ground provides a worthy green infrastructure asset that should be protected to help resolve the shortage of open space in Kingsholm and Wotton.\nI believe it is not beyond the wit of all parties to come up with a development solution that would provide much needed housing whilst retaining a large open space that could continue to be used for sport and recreation.\nHere is Policy INF3\n1. The green infrastructure network of local and strategic importance will be conserved and enhanced, in order to deliver a series of multifunctional, linked green corridors across the JCS area by:\ni. Improving the quantity and/or quality of assets;\nii. Improving linkages between assets in a manner appropriate to the scale of development, and\niii. Designing improvements in a way that supports the cohesive management of green\ninfrastructure;\n2. Development proposals should consider and contribute positively towards green infrastructure, including the wider landscape context and strategic corridors between major assets and populations. Where new residential development will create, or add to, a need for publicly accessible green space or outdoor space for sports and recreational on, this will be fully met in accordance with Policy INF4. Development at Strategic Alloca ons will be required to deliver connectivity through the site, linking urban areas with the wider rural hinterland\n3. Existing green infrastructure will be protected in a manner that reflects its contribution\nto ecosystem services (including biodiversity, landscape / townscape quality, the historic environment, public access, recreation and play) and the connectivity of the green infrastructure network. Development proposals that will have an impact on woodlands, hedges and trees will need to include a jus ca on for why this impact cannot be avoided and should incorporate measures acceptable to the Local Planning Authority to mi gate the loss. Mi ga on should be provided on-site or, where this is not possible, in the immediate environs of the site\n4. Where assets are created, retained or replaced within a scheme, they should be properly integrated into the design and contribute to local character and distinctiveness. Proposals should also make provisions for future maintenance of green infrastructure.\nE. Joint Core Strategy INF4\nAs I have previously mentioned the lack of serious community engagement by Redrow ahead of this planning application, about the future use of the site, is lamentable.\nRedrow have only showed plans that have proposed the complete building on the site, with the loss of the playing fields. They have never properly consulted anyone.\nI believe they failed to meet the requirement of Joint Core Strategy policy INF4 for social and community infrastructure\nHere is Policy INF4\n1. Proposals to develop land or buildings currently or previously in use as a community facility will demonstrate, including evidence of engagement with relevant local community groups and partner organisations, why the facility is no longer required and, as appropriate, how, when and where suitable local replacement facilities will be provided. Provision of replacement facilities will have regard to the locational and other relevant elements of this policy\n2. Where new residential development will create, or add to, a need for community facilities, it will be fully met as on-site provision and/or as a contribution to facilities or services o -site. New or refurbished provision will be of an appropriate type, standard and size. From an early stage, developers will be expected to engage with the relevant local authorities and infrastructure providers and, as appropriate, relevant local community groups where they exist, to ensure that new provision meets the needs of the community that it will serve and is t for purpose\n3. Social and community infrastructure should be centrally located to the population it serves and\nbe easily accessible on foot and by bicycle. It should be located so as to have the potential to be well-served by public transport. Developers should aim to provide flexible, multifunctional facilities within mixed-use developments, creating shared space which maximises benefits to the community and minimises land-take. In the case of open space, ‘easily accessible’ means it is located within reasonable walking distance of the development it serves. New facilities should be accessible to all members of the community, and be planned and phased in parallel with new development.\nF. Draft City Plan Policy SA06\nThe provision of 89 dwellings is in my opinion is overdevelopment of the site, which is in the heart of Kingsholm.\nCouncil policy as identified in the draft City Plan, which was approved by council in December 2016, recommends a maximum of twenty dwellings (SA06).\nThe proposal of 89 dwellings exceeds this policy by 445%, with the complete loss of the playing fields.\nA compromise of 40 dwellings, for example, on this site would mean that the former sports field could be brought back into use.\nG. Layout of the site:\nThe layout of the site does not follow the usual street pattern that is evident in Kingsholm. It is adjacent to both the Kingsholm and Denmark Road conservation areas.\nI am concerned that the narrow streets on estate may be become clogged up with motorists parking their cars on footpaths. This is a problem that will be exacerbated during times when there are rugby matches being played at the Kingsholm stadium.\nThe small public open space is set out to give the impression that it is an exclusive space just for the new residents of the estate. New public open space should laid out to be inclusive and available to all Kingsholm residents.\nH. Highway access:\nI am not convinced by the design of the access point onto Estcourt Road slip road.\nThe proposed access onto Denmark Road is unacceptable. It closes the slip road to Lansdown Road and removes much-needed parking spaces on Denmark Road.\nThe closure of the slip road will create more vehicle conflict at the other junction with Lansdown Road. This will be a particular problem when school coaches use this junction.\nThe closure of the slip road will also remove the u-turn provision it provides for the houses serviced off the dual carriageway section of Denmark Road on the south side.\nI. Public open space:\nKingsholm & Wotton has a low level of public open space as identified in the city council’s open spaces strategy. The council’s standard is 2.8ha per 1000\nBased on the new ward boundaries introduced at the 2016 election the ward has just 0.49ha per 1,000 population. Or 3.59ha for a population based on mid 2016 of 7,259 persons.\nAn opportunity is being missed in the proposed development to achieve a good increase in public open space provision in the ward by the wholesale development of the site, which was formerly used for sport and recreation.\nI would recommend that this appeal is dismissed.",

Please sign it at:-\nhttps://gloucester-libdems.org.uk/en/petition/save-our-sainsbury-s\nJeremy’s letter to Simon Roberts\nDear Mr Roberts\nI was shocked to learn this week that your company is to close its supermarket at Northgate Street, Gloucester after nearly 50 years of successful trading. Many people that I represent, who live in Kingsholm are very unhappy about the store’s closure as they use it regularly.\nMy Lib Dem colleague, Dr Rebecca Trimnell, who is campaigning for the residents of the city centre has raised an online petition to save the supermarket. The returns are good.\nI remember the store when it first opened as I had a Saturday job there as a teenager. I still shop in the store more than three times a week. Not only do residents of Kingsholm and city centre use it, but those working in the centre or other residents in Gloucester who are shopping in the city centre also pickup provisions before they go home.\nI imagine the store isn’t the strongest trading store, but it must still be profitable as the investment in the building will have been paid off long ago. I have noticed you have been running down the variety of stock, which may have hit trade a bit, but it’s Covid-19 pandemic that has had a major impact.\nHowever, trade is recoverable as we get through this pandemic. The city council is just about to invest in the refurbishment of Kings Square, which along with the regeneration around the bus and railway stations will bring in more people to the city centre. This will lead to an increase in footfall.\nIt would be so sad not to have a Sainsbury’s in the city centre while Tesco, Iceland and M&S will have a presence, but none of them can offer the same service and stock range that you can continue to do from Northgate Street.\nBoth Dr Rebecca Trimnell and I would appreciate meeting a senior representative of your company to discuss how we could keep the store open to mutual benefit.\nFinally, the city council will discuss a motion in my name about saving the store on the 24th of September.\nYours sincerely,\nCity Cllr.

Jeremy Hilton has said that the process to get here has been long and drawn out, but there has been rigorous consultation with residents.\nCllr. Hilton said: “The traffic regulation order is due to be made on the 18th of May and it will be advertised in the local paper. Everyone who responded to the consultation will be notified.\n“The purpose of the new parking regulations is to give priority to residents and to relieve the area of parking congestion. Over the years I have had many requests to do something about the parking congestion problems in Kingsholm. Hopefully the new scheme, which has been subject to thorough design and consultation processes will improve the situation.”\nLetters are then due to be sent to residents just before 5th June 2023 outlining the start of the installation works. This will also contain details directing residents on how to purchase parking permits.\nResidents will be entitled to two permits per household. The cost of the first permit is £63.65 and the second car £127.60. There is a reduced charge for Eco cars (vehicle excise duty band A). Residents can also purchase 50 visitor vouchers a year.\nCould you confirm how many residents have complained about parking issues over the years please? I would like to compare it against how many are complaining about the scheme being introduced. Thank you.\nThe parking review was a periodic review of the existing regulations. It was extended to include the wider community. Residents have been requesting resolution of parking congestion and parking obstructions at junctions and on footways over the last few years.\nIt’s becoming more apparent how badly thought out this scheme is as the lines and bays are being painted, if anything, the number of parking spaces is being reduced, as a result of the space required to mark out the bays, bad parking in the bays is already evident resulting in one car taking up the space of two,\nThe app to sign up for the permit is generating a number of issues and I for one will not be chasing round trying to resolve any of these issues if it does not work when I try to sign up\nIt’s very apparent that lots of people didn’t want this. They may have wanted (including myself) better parking but were not informed of the detail until everything was approved. Once the detail has been put to us as you can see from various platforms it’s been met with disagreement. It’s a real shame we’re all having to spend so much of our time dedicated to this without any local authority support. That’s why people are very cynical towards the local authority with comments like “stealth tax” and a “money making scheme ” .\nThere was considerable consultation ahead of making the traffic regulation order.

I voted yes in 1975 and I have never regretted that decision. My primary reason at that time was that I wanted peace in Europe. My parents and grandparents generation had been involved in two world wars that had ruined the lives of millions of Europeans. I never wanted this to happen again. As Churchill said; “jaw jaw is better than war war”.\nIn the last forty years we have seen Spain, Portugal and Greece become democracies and also all the countries in Eastern Europe as well. The EU helped this happen, a country must be a democracy to be a member.\nIn a global world, European countries need to work together to protect our environment, security and economy. Britain’s place must be around the table making the rules that make this happen. Though Britain is a net contributor to the EU it more than makes this up, eight fold, in the extra revenues gained by British businesses trading within the single market. To leave could see our car industry, for example, losing its duty free status with the imposition of a 10% tariff on all cars sold on the continent.\nI shall also be voting to remain for the benefit of future generations. The EU provides opportunities for our young people to work and study abroad. The benefits of the EU are multitude, but I end with one example, the European Health Insurance Card, issued free of charge, which provides us all with medical protection when we travel within the EU.",

There were just eight call-outs in 2012 but this soared to 43 last year and there have been at least 62 so far this year. This means firefighters are now dealing with e-cigarette related incidents at more than one a week.\nThe Local Government Association (LGA), which represents all 46 fire and rescue authorities in England and Wales, fears that these are the “tip of the iceberg” and many cases go unreported. The warning comes during national Electrical Fire Safety Week, which is run by the Electrical Safety Council charity. E-cigarettes have rocketed in popularity and are now used by an estimated 2.1 million Britons each year.\nThese latest statistics come just weeks after a 62-year-old man died when an e-cigarette battery on charge exploded and ignited oxygen equipment he was believed to have been using.\nFire chiefs say many blazes are taking place because smokers are not using compatible chargers. This means too much current goes into the batteries and they overheat and eventually explode. Battery material shoots out – up to two to three metres in distance – and can cause a fire if it lands on anything combustible.\nNow the LGA is calling for e-cigarette manufacturers to do more to warn of the dangers. This includes displaying prominent safety warnings, highlighting this issue, on e-cigarette kits and chargers.\nCllr Jeremy Hilton, Chair of the LGA’s Fire Services Management Committee, said: “The spiralling upward trend of fires connected with e-cigarettes is a major cause for concern and much more needs to be done to combat it. We expect this to continue to rise as more smokers switch to e-cigarettes. Alarmingly, there is no way of knowing the true figure as we understand many cases are going unreported.\n“We are urging e-cigarette manufacturers to introduce clear, prominent and graphic new warnings spelling out to users the dangers of using incompatible chargers with e-cigarette batteries.\n“Tragically, at least one life has been claimed and more fatalities could follow unless this issue is addressed rigorously and robustly.\n“We are warning users that it is simply not worth risking their lives to save a few pounds by buying dodgy, dangerous or incompatible chargers”\nEnds…\nE-CIGARETTE SAFETY TIPS\nE-cigarette users are advised to follow these safety tips when charging:\n* Always use the correct charger and follow the manufacturer’s instructions\n* Never charge a battery that has signs of damage, that has been dropped, or has been subjected to impact\n* Never plug a charger into a non-approved mains power transformer\n* Check that your e-cigarette battery has overcharge or overheat protection\n* Remove the battery from charge when complete – don’t over charge\n* Never leave a battery on charge unattended\n* Don’t use if wet or exposed to water\n* Do not over tighten the atomiser or when connecting to charger\n* Ensure that you dispose of batteries correctly.",

The time allowed to debate motions differs widely amongst local authorities across the country from a maximum of 30 minutes currently in Gloucestershire to no time limits in councils such as Cumbria. To reduce the risk of debates being too open ended the Liberal Democrats accepts there should be a total period of time spent on motions. It has been suggested that the maximum two hour limit be extended to three hours.\nCllr. Jeremy Hilton (LD, Kingsholm & Wotton) proposer of the motion said that: “For eight years the Tory stifled discussion on the big issues affecting Gloucestershire by using an oppressive guillotine on the length of debates. “Now the council has moved into no overall control we must relax the rules to allow all 53 councillors the opportunity to debate the major issues in the council chamber. “Our amendments to the constitution remove the guillotine on length of motions bringing democracy to Shire Hall.”\nThe Deputy Leader of the Liberal Democrat Group and Constitution Committee member Cllr. Paul Hodgkinson (LD, Bourton-on-the-Water & Northleach) also said that: “The time has now come where there is a need for full and unrestricted debate on those issues that are important to both the elected member and the constituents that they represent in the interests of transparency and democracy. “As a member recently elected I’ve been saddened that open debate has been stamped upon and councillors with valid points to make have been effectively gagged under the Council’s current rules.

Today the report of the air pollution task group, chaired by Cllr.

Jeremy Hilton said: “Public bodies in Gloucestershire need to do much more to reduce vehicle air pollution. We have a number of poor air quality hot spots in the county. Nitrogen Dioxides and particulate matter from vehicle emissions is a hazard to everyone’s health in the county. We have to take action to reduce these pollutants.\n“I shall be taking the report of the air pollution task group to the Environment & Community Scrutiny Committee next week, where I hope it is approved, before it is sent on to the county cabinet on the 6th of June.”\nThe report has a dozen recommendations that include the establishment of a Gloucestershire Air Quality Partnership to oversee future work. This will be helped by better air quality monitoring with a focus on particulate matter. Changes to planning policies are suggested. Highway interventions are recommended to reduce traffic congestion and air pollution.\nThe task group wishes to encourage the greater use of electric vehicles and also to set stronger targets to increase journeys by bicycle, on foot and public transport. It wants to see the use low emissions buses etc.\nCllr Hilton concluded: “This report is just a start. I would like to that everyone who came along to the workshop we held in January and to the members of the air pollution task group that helped draft the report.”",

Jeremy Hilton (Kingsholm & Wotton) said:\n“Freezing car-parking charges was one of our top six manifesto pledges. The county council earns a profit of more than £1.5 million from on-street car parking charges. It can well afford to freeze charges for the next four years.\n“In Gloucestershire 3,400 residents’ parking permits are issued each year. The annual fee for a permit is £80.

Already some roads in Kingsholm have a residents’ parking permit scheme.\nThe county council is also keen to find out what people think of on street electric vehicle charging points in the area. As part of the consultation, possible locations will be included for new on street EV charging points in these review zones for residents to consider. These charging points will be the first of 500 double charging points (1000 charging points in total) around the county, allowing those without a driveway to consider moving to an electric vehicle to reduce their carbon footprint.\nCounty Cllr Jeremy Hilton (Lib Dem) for Kingsholm, said: “The parking survey carried out in 2020 showed that a number of streets in Kingsholm were severely congested with parked cars and some roads were near to their capacity. Many residents do not have off street parking and find it very difficult at times to park their cars near to their homes. I’m therefore pleased that the county council is now carrying out a public consultation on parking in my division. I encourage everyone to have their say.”\nKingsholm City Councillor Angela Conder (Lib Dem) said: “There is no easy solution to managing on-street parking in Kingsholm, but we believe that the county council can do better. We are also interested in what people think about the location of the proposed electric vehicle charging points. Are they in the right place?”\nView the plans and give feedback online at www.gloucestershire.gov.uk/parkingreviews\nParking Review Process\nEach parking review follows a similar process as outlined below:\n- Scheme inception – initial data gathering and discussions with local stakeholders;\n- Informal consultation – consultation with local residents and businesses to find out if local people find parking a problem, if they would like to see changes considered, and if so, what changes.\n- Statutory consultation – a formal consultation process where we present a detailed proposed scheme. Feedback to this stage will be used to decide if any changes are made.\n- Implementation (if appropriate) – launch of new scheme.\nThe consultation questionnaire will be open for comments until the 15th October 2021.\nMy questions for cabinet at the county council 17th March\nThese are my written question to cabinet members at the county council being held virtually on the 17th March. It’s one of my tasks to keep the Tories on their toes. To challenge constructively.\nQ1 – Vernon Smith\nWhat is the outcome of the study carried out by Severn Trent, in collaboration with the county council, into the August 2020 floods that impacted on parts of Kingsholm?\nQ2 – Lynden Stowe\nDoes the county council own any land at Javelin Park that is not used by UBB and which may be free for non-incinerator uses?\nIf so what is the size of the unused land?\nQ3 – Nigel Moor\nHas the county council received the annual report from Allstone about their search for an alternative site to relocate their stone crushing, recycling, aggregates and skip hire business to?\nQ4 – Dave Norman\nWhen will the Kingsholm parking review be completed?\nQ5 – Vernon Smith\nAfter so many years of Tory control why are there as so many potholes all over the county?\nQ6 – Patrick Molyneux\nWhat plans do you have to build a new non-selective secondary to serve the north of Gloucester?\nQ7 – Vernon Smith\nWill you join me in condemning the persons who vandalised the speed survey equipment on Sandhurst Lane Gloucester?\nQ8 – Nigel Moor/Lynden Stowe\nWhat discussions have been had with the county council over plans} to locate an eco-park at the site of the Hempsted Landfill facility?\nSECOND HALF OF HORTON ROAD TO BE RESURFACED – from 26th Jan\nA few months ago Gloucestershire County Council resurfaced Horton Road from its junction of London Road to the Aspen Centre.\nA great job was done says local Lib Dem councillor Jeremy Hilton (Kingsholm & Wotton).\nNow the county council is to complete the work, which Cllr. Hilton previously requested. This will be a section from the Aspen Medical Centre to the junction with Great Western Road.\nThe planned start of the work is from the 26th of January to 1st of February, with the roadworks taking place between 7pm to 7am, excluding weekends.\nCllr. Hilton said: “I’m really pleased that this work is now taking place. The dates are subject to weather conditions. I ask those that need to use Horton Road to be patient. The contractors are very efficient. Once the new surface is down the road marking will be repainted. The current ones are badly faded to the extent drivers may be breaking traffic regulations without knowing it.”\nHAPPY NEW YEAR – HOPING IT’S BETTER THAN 2020\nMy best wishes to you all, take care and stay safe. I hope that now two vaccines have been approved life will return to normal this coming year.\nPeople across Kingsholm & Wotton county division pulled together brilliantly to help each other get through 2020. From our fabulous NHS and key workers to individuals volunteering to help their neighbours.\n2020 has been the busiest year ever for me as a local councillor.\nI have dealt many issues ranging from the impact of the pandemic, the new cycle route on London Road, tackling anti-social behaviour, the effects of the flooding during August, repairing our roads and footways, to raising petitions to save Kingsholm’s family homes and lobbying Sainsbury’s to try and stop them closing their Northgate Street…and much more!\nIt’s a great please to serve you on the council, I expect 2021 to be just as busy, do contact me, I’m here to help.\nPart of Horton Road to be resurfaced at last\nPart of Horton Road in Gloucester is shortly to be resurfaced. This is after a concerted campaign by the local county councillor, Jeremy Hilton.\nThe planned work is to be carried out at night between the 2nd and the 12th of October. The road will be closed between 7pm to 7am during the weekdays. It will not be closed on weekends.\nCllr. Jeremy Hilton (Kingsholm & Wotton) said:\n“I have been pressing the county council to resurface Horton Road for a long time. I am disappointed that only the stretch from London Road to the exit of the Aspen Medical Centre is to be resurfaced. The stretch from here to Great Western Road also needs doing.\n“There has been patching work, but Horton Road has needed a complete resurface.\n“This road is used by a lot of traffic and it’s breaking up in many places. The previous resurfacing wasn’t good enough. I am hoping this time the work will include strengthening the foundations.”\nKingsholm Primary School safer streets project.\nThe county council is proposing to introduce an experimental traffic order from 2nd of November, which will close of Sweetbriar Street, Guinea Street and Union Street at school drop off and pick up times. Residents will always be able to get access as permits will be provided.\nThe ‘school streets’ project at Kingsholm Primary School is will operate for 18 months on a trial basis.\nIn principle, I support school streets as it will remove the hazard of cars parking around the school at these times and reduce the air pollution.\nFor many Kingsholm parents who walk their children to school it way may be beneficial, be safer and healthier for their children.\nParents from other parts of the city who drive their children to school will now have to park further away and walk their children to school.\nThe total budget for the school streets project that also incudes schools in Cheltenham and Tewkesbury is £100,000.\nThe county council is finalising documentation and it will be issuing advice about this project shortly.\nIf you have any concerns write to me jeremy.hilton@gloucestershire.gov.uk or thinktravel@gloucestershire.gov.uk.\nChaos at the roundabout\nLoads of people are complaining about the changes to the Cheltenham Road and Estcourt Road roundabout. And rightly so. It is part of the new London Road cycle route, which in principle I support. I did walk the route with the cabinet member and engineers ahead of design work. However, we started from Denmark Road and walked towards the city centre. We didn’t visit the roundabout, which is a pity. As I would NOT have recommended it laid out as they suggested.\nI only got the published plans 40 minutes after a press release was issued. Despite my request 8 days before asking for the final plans. I was not happy. It’s when I got these plans that it became obvious the roundabout had been added to the scheme.\nThis project has been rushed through by the county council cabinet. The leader of the county council lives on Estcourt Road. Neighbouring Longlevens councillor Kathy Williams also serves in the cabinet.\nI am also currently backing residents on London Road who have lost their on-street parking spaces outside their homes with very short notice. I’m also unhappy with the removal of the pedestrian refuge outside Tesco. I’m OK with two new pedestrian crossings and the reworking of the England’s Glory crossing. The reworking of the buildout outside Healey Mews looks OK, but I await feedback from the residents who live there. I’m hoping the removal of the speed camera doesn’t see an increase in traffic speeds.\nProjects like this one need to be carefully considered, fully consulted on and professionally implemented. This hasn’t been done. I am told the roundabout scheme, which has only partly been implemented is under review and being revised. When I get the drawings I will post them on this website.\nJeremy Hilton to quiz Tory cabinet members on poor performance\nTory leaders at Shire Hall are being quizzed on their performance by a senior Liberal Democrat councillor.\nCouncillor Jeremy Hilton, who represents Kingsholm and Wotton, has tabled a dozen challenging questions to Conservative cabinet members for its full council meeting on September 9.\nHe has asked questions about care home admissions, the performance of children’s services, gulley cleaning, new cycling projects, the future of local government in Gloucestershire and the financial health of the county council.\nCouncillor Hilton, who is also leader of the Lib Dem group on Gloucester City Council, said:\n“I am concerned about the poor performance of the Tory administration who control the county council and the impact this is having on services in Gloucester.\n“After 15 years in charge, they are struggling to deliver decent services.\n“They failed miserably to handle the Covid-19 crisis in our care homes, children’s services is still poorly performing and there are big holes in the council’s finances.\n“Frankly, the Tories are exhausted and complacent. They have run out of good ideas. They are clueless. They are unable to keep budgets under control and vulnerable people are getting a raw deal.\n“With all this going on the Tories are now planning to spend valuable time on local government reorganisation leaving Gloucester without its own dedicated council for the first time in over 500 years.”\nCouncillor Hilton said he will be very interested to see the answers from the cabinet when they are published. He can ask supplementary questions.\nWritten Questions put by Cllr. Jeremy Hilton\n1. To Tim Harman\nStaff in elderly persons care homes are now being tested for COVID-19 anti-bodies. Can you please provide data to include how many tests have been done so far and how many tests proved positive or negative?\n2. To Kathy Williams\nOn the 7th of April a press release was issued by the county council in which you were quoted. The press release reported that the county council was helping the NHS Hospital Trust transfer patients from hospital into elderly persons care homes within three hours.\nConsidering that it was known at the time that some elderly people were not being tested for Covid-19 infection and that some subsequently died, why didn’t you say no to such untested transfers?\n3. Kathy Williams\nHow many residents in the county elderly persons care homes have died from Covid-19 since the beginning of the pandemic?\n4. Richard Boyles\nCan you please state what the agreed budget for services vulnerable children was for the following years and what the financial outcome (final spend) was when the accounts were closed?\n2015/16, 2016/17, 2017/18, 2018/19, 2019/20\n5. Richard Boyles\nHow many young people are in the council’s care?\n6. Richard Boyles\nHow many of those young people in your answer to the previous question are placed out of county and what is the cost to this council?\n7. Richard Boyles\nUnder your leadership will you ever turn around the failing children’s services? You only have until May 2021 to do so.\n8. Vernon Smith\nHow many gullies in the city of Gloucester were cleaned during the Covid-19 lockdown period?\n9. Nigel Moor\nWhat plans other than on London Road, do you have to improve the cycling infrastructure in the city of Gloucester\n10. Mark Hawthorne\nAs a city resident, would you support the abolition of Gloucester City Council in favour of a single unitary council serving the whole of Gloucestershire, ending the current two-tier system?\n11. Lynden Stowe\nWhat is the expected additional cost, in this financial year, to this council for its response to the Covid-19 pandemic?\n12. Lynden Stowe\nCould you please list all additional Covid-19 grant funding this council has received from the government or has been promised?\nKingsholm parking review about to start\nThe county council’s long-awaited review of on-street parking in Kingsholm is just about to start and should be completed by November this year.\nThe first stage of the project will be a camera car survey this month to carried by contractors Atkins. This will take vehicle data to establish the occupancy, parking stress and demand on an area as well as duration of stay and generally how far people have travelled to park, i.e. are they local to area, the street, city or come further away.\nThe survey will take place over a week, picking two or three days that week and carrying out the surveys three times a day. The results of the traffic survey will take a month to come back. Afterwards, an informal consultation will be done from March to May with residents and businesses.\nLocal Lib Dem councillors Jeremy Hilton and Isabel Brazil are pleased that work on the review is starting. They have received loads of complaints from residents about parking congestion in Kingsholm. They have passed on several emails to the traffic manager about parking problems.\nCllr. Jeremy Hilton said:\n“The streets in Kingsholm are overloaded with commuters parking in residential streets leaving little space during the daytime for residents to park up near to their home. There many properties in the ward which do not have off street parking.\n“The survey area will consider most streets in Kingsholm. Hopefully, at the end of the project we will have parking regulations that are fit for purpose.”\nCllr. Isabel Brazil said:\n“Parking congestion in Kingsholm is a problem. We do encourage residents to write to us and we shall pass all comments onto the parking manager to form part of the evidence.”\nTimetable\n- Informal consultation with residents – March to May\n- Statutory consultation – June to July\n- Formal Advertising preparation – June to July\n- Formal advertising responses – July to August\n- Traffic order amendments – Sept\n- Traffic Regulation Order sign off – Oct\n- Making Traffic Regulation Order – Nov\n- Implementation work – Nov",

Cllr Hilton has already succeeded in his campaign to get free WiFi provided at Gloucester Central Library. He now wants it installed into the five other libraries within the city boundaries.\nThe free WiFi service started at the Brunswick Road library on the 2nd of February, but this is currently the only library in Gloucester with this service. Free WiFi is also operated in Cirencester & Cheltenham libraries.\nJeremy Hilton said: “Libraries must offer a 21st Century service. I am delighted that free WiFi is now available in Gloucester Central Library. The users of our main library will be delighted.\n“If McDonalds can do it, so can our county libraries. The county council must now provide free public WiFi at Longlevens, Hucclecote, Quedgeley, Tuffley and Matson libraries.\n“There is no excuse in not modernising Gloucester’s libraries.

We will progress the regeneration of our historic city, with more panache and urgency than the current Tory administration.\n“Gloucester City Council needs a new administration that has the energy and ideas to take the city into the 21st Century.”\nDeputy Leader Cllr. Sebastian Field said: “Gloucester as a city is on the up, with regeneration projects happening all across the city. But in many areas of the city, the Conservative council has failed to live up to its promises.\n“Recycling rates are low in this city, and these must improve to avoid fines for sending too much waste to landfill. The Kings Quarter redevelopment has been delayed over and over again, and residents are now tired of waiting.”\nGloucester City Council Liberal Democrat Group 2015 Manifesto\nKeeping Gloucester Moving Forward\nOur Ten Point plan for Gloucester:-\n1) Regeneration of our city is a top priority. King’s Quarter has been delayed again and again. We will make sure that the city centre is not forgotten, and will press developers to deliver on time, with developments that local people actually want.\n2) Our idea to provide free wifi in Gloucester city centre is being implemented. We will make sure it is delivered in time for the Rugby World Cup. We will create a modern welcome for visitors to our historic city.\n3) Liberal Democrats in Gloucester are working to ensure there are clean, modern public conveniences in the city centre. The Tory administration’s Community Toilet scheme is a failure, and Gloucester deserves better.\n4) Gloucestershire Airport Ltd (GAL) is owned by the city council, jointly with Cheltenham Borough Council. We shall continue to support GAL as a general aviation airport to provide jobs and air transport services. We shall also deliver our plans to enhance the railway station and the building of a new central bus station.\n5) We will lobby the government to provide better infrastructure for Gloucester, from roads and public transport, to superfast broadband for all new developments.\n6) We have consistently opposed the massive waste incinerator planned for Javelin Park, Quedgeley. Local Tories on the county council rammed this plan through with the help of UKIP councillors, despite it being unanimously rejected by the planning committee. We will ensure that household waste that is collected by the city council is not burnt in an incinerator when it can be recycled.\n7) Gloucester Liberal Democrats will listen to the residents of Gloucester in making their budget decisions. In these challenging times, councils have to make tough choices and innovate to save money and create revenue. We will listen to all ideas for how best to do this.\n8) Gloucester Cathedral is a magnificent building at the heart of our city. It could be a World Heritage Site, which would make it even more of a tourist attraction. Liberal Democrats chair a group trying to make this happen.\n9) Gloucester has a rich heritage and cultural history. We currently do not have an Arts Council-supported venue in the city, and we would work to make that a reality. Gloucester should be a creative hub for artists, writers, musicians and performers. We will bring more Festivals and events to Gloucester, including a literary festival.\n10) Gloucester Liberal Democrats will ensure that the Rugby World Cup is a fantastic celebration enjoyed by all. The city must be spotlessly clean and there must be adequate facilities to accommodate all the extra fans. The council must work with England Rugby to ensure a lasting legacy from the World Cup. We will assist Gloucester City Football Club to return home to Gloucester in their plans to build a new stadium at Meadow Park.",

A sale therefore, may be subject to planning permission.\nThis morning, I have asked officers at the city council for an update. This is what I was told:\n“We have not had any confirmation from the owners or any prospective purchasers that the building has been sold and therefore it would be wrong to speculate on what the terms of any hypothetical disposal may be.”\nAs I have said before, my preference is to see the building restored to its former glory and repurposed if necessary.\nAs a regular shopper at this store I am also disappointed to see Debenhams go into liquidation.\nDebenhams building is not listed, though it sits in a conservation area so cannot be demolished without the council’s permission.\nWhat I do not want to see is this landmark building demolished to make way for a new build.\nThe Lib Dem group are determined to work with the new owners to see this handsome building fully restored and fully occupied.

There were just eight call-outs in 2012 but this soared to 43 last year and there have been at least 62 so far this year. This means firefighters are now dealing with e-cigarette related incidents at more than one a week.\nThe Local Government Association (LGA), which represents all 46 fire and rescue authorities in England and Wales, fears that these are the “tip of the iceberg” and many cases go unreported. The warning comes during national Electrical Fire Safety Week, which is run by the Electrical Safety Council charity. E-cigarettes have rocketed in popularity and are now used by an estimated 2.1 million Britons each year.\nThese latest statistics come just weeks after a 62-year-old man died when an e-cigarette battery on charge exploded and ignited oxygen equipment he was believed to have been using.\nFire chiefs say many blazes are taking place because smokers are not using compatible chargers. This means too much current goes into the batteries and they overheat and eventually explode. Battery material shoots out – up to two to three metres in distance – and can cause a fire if it lands on anything combustible.\nNow the LGA is calling for e-cigarette manufacturers to do more to warn of the dangers. This includes displaying prominent safety warnings, highlighting this issue, on e-cigarette kits and chargers.\nCllr Jeremy Hilton, Chair of the LGA’s Fire Services Management Committee, said: “The spiralling upward trend of fires connected with e-cigarettes is a major cause for concern and much more needs to be done to combat it.

A genuine, high performing comprehensive school. There is no need for any further grammar school places.

I intend to vote yes again on Thursday with a positive vote to REMAIN in the European Union. A union of 28 countries working together peacefully to sort out issues of cross border importance, such as trade, the environment and security.\nMy primary reason in voting yes in 1975 was to make sure that European countries sorted out their differences around a table and not on a battlefield. I wanted to live my life in peace. I have never regretted my decision. I have seen the Common Market of nine countries grow into the European Union of twenty-eight.\nIn 1975 the continent was split between western democracies and socialist dictatorships. Spain, Greece & Portugal were becoming democracies and joined the EU in the early 1980s. Now the EU has a population of 508 million living in peace with each other and with governments co-operating over issues that affect us all. As Winston Churchill said “Jaw Jaw is better than War War”.\nI have been concerned about the whole tone of the referendum campaign, particularly when I listen to those arguing to leave. I also think to myself; ‘I want my country back’. But, what I certainly don’t want is the UK run by a right wing clique of people who feed on people’s fears and concerns. Who stir up xenophobia and blame others for our problems.\nI grew up in a country that was proud of itself and was an open and free society, working with other nations within international organisations such as the UN, NATO, the Commonwealth and the EU. I believe that if we leave the EU it will be a step backwards. We could see our country fall apart with Scotland leaving the UK and “Little England” left just floating in the mid-Atlantic with few friends.\nAs individuals we would lose our right to live and work anywhere in the EU. Our European Health Insurance Card will become invalid. Many of us will suffer from loss of work or earnings. Taxes may rise. We shall probably experience years of regret that we isolated ourselves from our friends on the continent.\nI also want to address the nonsense espoused by leave campaigners that the EU is undemocratic, this is untrue. Every five years we elect MEP’s to represent us in the European Parliament, which amends and approves legalisation that the Council of Ministers’ support. The Council of Ministers includes an elected representative from every government. The European Commission acts in a similar way to our very own Civil Service.\nI hope that everyone will think very carefully about the way they are going to vote on Thursday. This is not the time to bash the Tory government, we can do that at the ballot box at the next general election. This is a time to vote for our children’s future. In my view it will be much better for them if we remain in the EU.",

The fifteen year contract is due to end on 31st March 2022 and is valued at £5.7m per year. Amey are contracted to provide street cleaning, grounds maintenance, recycling and refuse collection services.\nThe call by Jeremy Hilton to end the contract early, comes as councillors email inboxes have been flooded with complaints from residents about missed bin collections over the Christmas period. This follows on from a similar problem with bins not being collected last year due to insufficient drivers being employed by Amey. The quality of the street cleaning and grounds maintenance services is also problematic.\nThe streetcare service will be discussed at the Overview and Scrutiny Committee on Monday 8th January and Jeremy Hilton will call for an ending of the contract earlier rather later and for all options to be considered, including bringing the service back in-house with a direct labour organisation.\nPreviously, Richard Cook the cabinet member in charge has described the contract as the worst he has ever seen.\nJeremy Hilton said: “It is time that the administration took action and cancelled the contract because of poor performance. The sooner we reorganise the streetcare services the better. I favour serious consideration to bringing the service back in-house with council employing and managing staff directly rather than through a third party. We have had a number of failures on the refuse collection service in the last twelve months, grounds maintenance is inadequate and street cleaning in Gloucester is just not good enough.”\nJeremy,\nFor some reason our food waste bin wasn’t emptied on December 11th when the others were. Then, because of Christmas and the snow, it hasn’t been emptied since. We are still waiting for food bins to be emptied on Heathville Road.

As I would NOT have recommended it laid out as they suggested.\nI only got the published plans 40 minutes after a press release was issued. Despite my request 8 days before asking for the final plans. I was not happy. It’s when I got these plans that it became obvious the roundabout had been added to the scheme.\nThis project has been rushed through by the county council cabinet. The leader of the county council lives on Estcourt Road. Neighbouring Longlevens councillor Kathy Williams also serves in the cabinet.\nI am also currently backing residents on London Road who have lost their on-street parking spaces outside their homes with very short notice. I’m also unhappy with the removal of the pedestrian refuge outside Tesco. I’m OK with two new pedestrian crossings and the reworking of the England’s Glory crossing. The reworking of the buildout outside Healey Mews looks OK, but I await feedback from the residents who live there. I’m hoping the removal of the speed camera doesn’t see an increase in traffic speeds.\nProjects like this one need to be carefully considered, fully consulted on and professionally implemented.

They are fed up with the noise and dust that emanates from it.\n“The people living nearby at Swallow Park and Armscroft Estate have already suffered from four years of noise and dust from the operation of the stone crushing. This application is the third to seek temporary permission. When does temporary use become semi permanent. Do residents deserve another three years of dust and noise?

They started this practice without planning in the first place& you as council let them get away with it, in the summer if there is the slightest wind there brick dust covers are cars, windows & garden furniture & you can feel it in the air. This is very unhealthy especially if you have small children & it covers the prams in there rubbish & they are breathing this in. I feel ( allstone ) have been breaking the rules long enough & should be stopped, I can’t wait for the new tenants to move on the triangle & let them get covered in there rubbish, not surprised you have problems getting any one to move there. This practice has created more lorries coming from outside of county not just Gloucester creating more noise.

It makes a mockery of the so called Gloucester City council, when you realise that they have misguidedly given All Stone group permission to affect people’s health for the last three years.\nI hope that this has no lasting affect on my families respiratory health as if it does I will take appropriate action against those who let this happen.\nIs Gloucester city council really going to let Allstone have “temporary permission” for another three years……………………….\nThe application will be determined by Gloucestershire County Council.

Last time residents parking was considered the residents of Oxford Road voted no. However, since then some have asked for residents parking to be introduced. The consultation will determine whether parking scheme is introduced or not.\nYour not prepared to pay 5 pound a month to park in your own road?. I live in swan road and it’s worth every penny. Think about it instead of being a tight arse. Your clearly begging for permits to happen.\nI am heavily in favour of expanding the residents parking permit zone to include more of Kingsholm.

I will forwarded your comments to the traffic regulations officer.\nThis does not seem to include Lansdown Road – where all the other cars will go if there is resident permit parking on the side roads. Where does that leave residents of Lansdown Road? With nowhere to park? How do they get included in this review?\nAnd what if your house is on a corner of two roads, one with restrictions and one without?\nI don’t see how you can cut an area up like this, and expect it to suit everyone. It should be either all or nothing.\nI have great sympathy for Kingsholm residents who have rugby, commuter, university student, hospital and school attendees all parking in the area. It is notable how quiet the streets are during the summer and Christmas holidays.\nThe zones for consideration are the ones provided by the county council. The basically include areas where most houses do not have off street parking. I will forwarded your comments about Lansdown Road. Problem here is that every house has off street parking.\nWhen will we find out the result of the consultation and will we have opportunity to give our opinions on this as residents? Seems unfair to punish the residents purely because commuters and hospital workers are too tight to pay for their own parking.\nThe consultation hasn’t begun. I’m waiting for this to be announced. Some residents are asking for scheme to be introduced, just so they can park near their homes. It not about punishing anyone, but about better management of on-street parking. Without it commuters can clog up the streets all day long.\nWe live in Deans Way and are keen to be involved in the process and would welcome residents parking permits. We have lived here for 25 years and the parking has never been so bad as it is now, we quite often can’t park in our street let alone near our house.\nWe are very much in favour of residents parking permits and happy to pay the fee.\nThe review of residents parking will start in October and take a year to complete.\nWill the consultation bear in mind the fact that a large number of residents on Oxford Rd are students and will therefore vote against? I wouldn’t want the vote swayed by a vast majority who only reside here for a certain number of weeks per year and have a large number of cars between them!\nI live in Alexandra Road and have Elizabeth House, Alexander House, Cherry Tree Lodge plus two more additional care facilities within close proximity of one another down our street. All of their staff and the staff at Gloucestershire hospital use our street as a glorified NCP car park. Parking is awful. I’m registered disabled and have made an application for a disabled bay but because I can’t even park in our street, let alone outside my property the line painters can’t come and put the marking’s on the road.\nI’m all for permit holders only. It’s just a shame that as residents we have to foot the financial shortfall because other people are inconsiderate and abuse the system.\nHello we live up Henry street ….the parking is bad …. 4hrs for anybody to park who don’t love up there I think it should be just 2 hours\nIt’s 2 hours for non permit holders in Henry Street",

An inquest has opened into the deaths of two men who died after a tumble dryer caught fire.\nThe LGA is warning that companies who are running lengthy repair programmes for potentially dangerous machines, instead of recalling them, are risking the lives of millions of customers.\nIt is calling on manufacturers to recall affected tumble driers and for all white goods to have fire-proof markings on them, including the manufacturer, model and serial number, so they can be identified more easily if they are damaged after causing a fire.\nCllr Jeremy Hilton, Chair of the LGA’s Fire Services Management Committee, said:\n“People using faulty tumble dryers are unwittingly playing Russian roulette and leading manufacturers need to recall affected models as soon as possible to protect their customers.\n“Firefighters are attending tumble dryer fires three times a day, which is alarming. These defective products are endangering lives, causing thousands of pounds of damage to homes and making people homeless.\n“People’s safety must be the priority. It’s been months since some manufacturers issued safety warnings over their tumble dryers but they need to be recalled as these appliances are still causing fires – until they do so, consumers continue to risk falling victim to a devastating and tragic house fire.\n“Fire-proof markings on all white goods would also help improve manufacturing and safety standards by helping fire investigators identify the make and model of any appliance damaged after causing a fire.\n“Users must take simple precautions using tumble dryers. The compartment where fibres from fabric build up should be cleaned out after every load of clothes is dried, to reduce the risk of it igniting, and the vent or any other opening should not be covered.\n“People should never leave tumble driers on overnight or when they go out. Anyone buying an electrical item should complete the guarantee registration to ensure goods which do not meet safety specifications are repaired, replaced or refunded. This also enables manufacturers to contact owners in the event of a product recall.\n“People also need to ensure they have a working smoke alarm – which can be a life-saver – in the event something does go wrong and test them regularly, ideally once a week.”\nAnyone with concerns about the safety of electrical appliances can report them to the Citizens Advice consumer helpline on 03454 04 05 06.\nIt,s all very well saying they need to be changed or fixed but judging by the last three weeks of trying to get Hotpoint or even Currys to sort my issue out I firmly believe that customers of the failing dryers are just so fed up chasing the manufacturer or supplier that they give up trying………Hotpoint customer service department is shamefully to say the least and all Currys wants to do is say Sorry but don’t actually do anything. I opted to purchase a new dryer which seems simple enough , I went through with their online process, selected the dryer, picked a local shop , picked a date and then paid online …….The fateful day arrived……..local shop said nope……..not here. Their online ordering system indicated I had already exchanged the dryer and so it went on day after day of waiting in a queue for someone to help. One person actually said What do you expect Hotpoint to do ? In a sarcastic manner………All I wanted was the dryer I had paid for. So it does not surprise me that there are loads of possible fire risk units still out there……..seems Hotpoint are hell bent on slowing the process thus saving them money……rant over",

Firstly, in December 2011, the Liberal Democrats lodged what is known as a ‘call-in’ over the selection of a preferred bidder and again another ‘call-in’ was submitted in September 2012 over the Cabinet’s decision to award the contract to Urbaser Balfour Beatty (UBB) before the Council’s planning committee had considered the incinerator application.\nLeader of the Liberal Democrats, Cllr. Jeremy Hilton (LD: Kingsholm and Wotton) who will be leading calls for the review said:\n“From the beginning, we’ve always challenged the process. In making a decision to cancel the incinerator contract at this stage, one needs to be sure of the exact costs involved and whether or not the contract had the necessary break-clauses in place to minimise any potential financial risk to this council.\n“I am not convinced that the £60m-£100m cost to cancel the UBB contract is accurate, but has been instead overly estimated as a scaremongering tactic to stop elected members from voting in favour of cancelling the contract for fear of reprisals to council services.\n“It is only right and responsible for an independent auditor to examine the contract in detail and determine impartially the actual figures involved with cancelling a contract of this nature and at this particular stage.\n“If the figures are proved to be accurate, then, the Tories should be ashamed of themselves in purposefully tying our hands to a stringent and highly inflexible contract that will cost many millions of taxpayers’ money to cancel and detrimentally affect many council services.\n“Until we know fully the costs involved, then, I do not feel that any elected member on Wednesday can make an informed decision over whether or not to cancel the incinerator contract.\n“Labour has been overzealous in calling for the cancellation of the incinerator without first looking at all the costs involved and are playing politics over an important issue, which is simply for the benefit of their parliamentary candidate standing in Stroud. If sensible they too would be asking for such a review.\n“It is time that we stop playing politics with such an important issue and get to the bottom of the real costs involved and whether the process was done correctly from the beginning.”\nDeputy Leader of the Liberal Democrats, Cllr. Iain Dobie (LD: Leckhampton and Warden Hill) also said:\n“If Labour are serious about cancelling this contract then wouldn’t it be better for them to know all the facts and surely if the Tories have nothing to hide then delaying work until the contract has been independently scrutinised would give elected members and residents of Gloucestershire confidence in the current administration.\n“A review of this kind would give elected members like myself who were only elected in 2013 all the facts to make a reasoned and informed decision on whether it really is in the best interests of Gloucestershire to cancel the incinerator contract or not. I believe in transparency and I come to this without any prejudice.\n“Our request is basically that once this review has been completed and a full uncensored report be presented to full council on Wednesday 20th May, then, we shall be in a much better position to make such an important decision.”",

The latest excuse was provided by the Conservative cabinet member in a written answer to a question from Lib Dem councillor for Kingsholm, Cllr. Jeremy Hilton.\nThe survey is planned so that the council can provide definitive evidence that too many family homes in Kingsholm are being converted into Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMO).\nA 130-signature petition was handed into the cabinet by Jeremy Hilton in November 2020.\nThe Petition said:\n“Too many family homes in Kingsholm are being converted into Houses in Multiple Occupation, without planning permission being required. It is currently permitted development for six persons or less.\nI/We the undersigned demand that the city council starts work immediately on preparing evidence and documentation to apply to the Secretary of State to give Kingsholm the protection of an Article 4 Direction. This means that all conversions of family homes into Houses in Multiple Occupation would require planning permission.”\nCllr. Jeremy Hilton said:\n“Lib Dems tried to amend the council plan in July 2020 to get the work started on a housing stock survey, but the Conservatives voted it down.\n“That is why I raised an online petition to get public support. I handed it in at the November 2020 cabinet.\n“Shortly afterwards, I met officers who suggested we schedule the survey work for April this year. Then it was delayed until the summer to be part of a countywide housing survey.\n“Now the Cabinet Member for Planning and Housing Strategy says there have been delays because of legal queries and the tender documents haven’t been issued. It is ridiculous, the word incompetence comes to mind.\n“Kingsholm residents are frustrated by the Conservative council’s reluctance to treat Kingsholm as a special case. We see the onward creep of Houses in Multiple Occupation and the damage done to the community. Parking, noise and litter all contribute to the degradation of our once-quiet streets.”\nJeremy Hilton concluded:\n“It is very frustrating trying to get projects implemented at the city council. We are given dates, then later dates and then sometime never. The Conservatives have cut back so far, nothing seems to get done on time. The council has accurately been described as the ‘vanishing council’.\n“This housing stock survey is critical in getting our planning rules toughened up to protect Kingsholm’s family homes. It cannot be delayed further by red-tape or more accurately blue-tape.”\nResidents in Kingsholm are being asked for their views on new proposals to free up parking spaces for households, with an informal consultation now open until 15th October for people to provide their feedback.\nResidents have eight weeks to have their say on a potential new and improved permit scheme aiming to make it easier for them to park closer to home.\nOver the years many parking issues have been raised by Kingsholm residents and the county council wants to make sure on-street parking provision in the area is still fit for purpose.\nPotentially introducing a permit scheme is one way which could prioritise residents’ vehicles over other users.

Yesterday I had a telephone conversation to follow up on our recent email communications.\nThere has been some progress and Pall Mall have commissioned an architect to look at options for the site whether they be the conversion of the existing building or demolition and new build. Both for residential purposes.\nThe site is allocated for 30 dwellings in the city plan. Pall Mall are looking for 70 to 100 units. I think there are trying to squeeze too much onto the site and have told them so.\nHere are the answers to some questions I put to Pall Mall\nCllr Hilton – Did the city council provide you with a list of its contacts from registered social landlords?\nPall Mall – Yes\nCllr Hilton – Have you had any successful negotiations with Registered Social Landlord to progress a housing scheme for the site?\nPall Mall – Not yet, albeit RSL focus has deviated away from apartment development meantime due to Covid. We anticipate this will be revived in due course.\nCllr Hilton – How many housing units do you think would make a viable project?\nPall Mall – Depending upon proposals (i.e. holistic new build or part conversion / part new build), tenure and end product we are looking in the region of 70-100 homes.\nCllr Hilton – Have you made contact with Homes England about securing some public funds?\nPall Mall – Developer/RSL to make enquiries.\nCllr Hilton – What value do you need to get from the sale. I have heard £4 million?\nPall Mall – Yes.\nCllr Hilton – Have you had since we met any non-housing enquiries?\nI have been in contact with the site manager of Glevum Green housing development. In particular, I have expressed concern about the cleaning of neighbouring streets to clear the mud from the roads and the use of the Wotton Pitch route along Denmark by lorries visiting the construction site.\nSTREET CLEANING\nRoad sweeping Schedule has been increased due to the wet weather. The road sweeper is now in use during working hours every day Monday to Friday. Redrow tell me they have introduced extra measures to reduce mud reaching the road. A bowser has been introduced to wash the wheels of vehicles leaving the site.\nTRANSPORT ROUTE\nLorries should NOT be travelling to and from the site via the London Road direction. All vehicles should arrive and leave by accessing Kingsholm Road. See the approved route map. Redrow have told me they have reminded their groundworks contractors of the approved route to the site and the banksman team at the dispatch end have been told to remind drivers of the approved exit route.\nIf you do see lorries travelling down Denmark Road from Wotton Pitch/London Road try and capture a photo or record their number plate and email me at Jeremy.hilton@gloucestershire.gov.uk with time and date and I will report the matter to the site manager for you.\nA few months ago Gloucestershire County Council resurfaced Horton Road from its junction of London Road to the Aspen Centre.\nA great job was done says local Lib Dem councillor Jeremy Hilton (Kingsholm & Wotton).\nNow the county council is to complete the work, which Cllr. Hilton previously requested. This will be a section from the Aspen Medical Centre to the junction with Great Western Road.\nThe planned start of the work is from the 26th of January to 1st of February, with the roadworks taking place between 7pm to 7am, excluding weekends.\nCllr. Hilton said: “I’m really pleased that this work is now taking place. The dates are subject to weather conditions. I ask those that need to use Horton Road to be patient. The contractors are very efficient. Once the new surface is down the road marking will be repainted. The current ones are badly faded to the extent drivers may be breaking traffic regulations without knowing it.”",

They have run out of good ideas. They are clueless.

To Kathy Williams\nOn the 7th of April a press release was issued by the county council in which you were quoted. The press release reported that the county council was helping the NHS Hospital Trust transfer patients from hospital into elderly persons care homes within three hours.\nConsidering that it was known at the time that some elderly people were not being tested for Covid-19 infection and that some subsequently died, why didn’t you say no to such untested transfers?\n3. Kathy Williams\nHow many residents in the county elderly persons care homes have died from Covid-19 since the beginning of the pandemic?\n4. Richard Boyles\nCan you please state what the agreed budget for services vulnerable children was for the following years and what the financial outcome (final spend) was when the accounts were closed?\n2015/16, 2016/17, 2017/18, 2018/19, 2019/20\n5. Richard Boyles\nHow many young people are in the council’s care?\n6. Richard Boyles\nHow many of those young people in your answer to the previous question are placed out of county and what is the cost to this council?\n7. Richard Boyles\nUnder your leadership will you ever turn around the failing children’s services? You only have until May 2021 to do so.\n8. Vernon Smith\nHow many gullies in the city of Gloucester were cleaned during the Covid-19 lockdown period?\n9. Nigel Moor\nWhat plans other than on London Road, do you have to improve the cycling infrastructure in the city of Gloucester\n10. Mark Hawthorne\nAs a city resident, would you support the abolition of Gloucester City Council in favour of a single unitary council serving the whole of Gloucestershire, ending the current two-tier system?\n11.

David Brown (Hucclecote), Lib Dem spokesperson for housing & planning said: “The city council have a timetable to deliver the City Plan but due to the delay in adopting the Joint Core Strategy (JCS) it is now woefully outdated. We need the council to be able to work with developers from a position of strength, with a clear plan for the city, a plan that best benefits current and future residents. For that we need a City Plan that is fit for the future sooner rather than later.”\nThe new City Plan should be a development document that sits beneath the JCS. It must explain how the council will implement the spatial vision and strategic objectives in the JCS up to the year 2031 and provide criteria that it will apply when considering planning applications for different types of buildings or other development.",

There were just eight call-outs in 2012 but this soared to 43 last year and there have been at least 62 so far this year. This means firefighters are now dealing with e-cigarette related incidents at more than one a week.\nThe Local Government Association (LGA), which represents all 46 fire and rescue authorities in England and Wales, fears that these are the “tip of the iceberg” and many cases go unreported. The warning comes during national Electrical Fire Safety Week, which is run by the Electrical Safety Council charity. E-cigarettes have rocketed in popularity and are now used by an estimated 2.1 million Britons each year.\nThese latest statistics come just weeks after a 62-year-old man died when an e-cigarette battery on charge exploded and ignited oxygen equipment he was believed to have been using.\nFire chiefs say many blazes are taking place because smokers are not using compatible chargers. This means too much current goes into the batteries and they overheat and eventually explode. Battery material shoots out – up to two to three metres in distance – and can cause a fire if it lands on anything combustible.\nNow the LGA is calling for e-cigarette manufacturers to do more to warn of the dangers.

We will seek to use more environmentally friendly technology to dispose of the residual household waste.\n4. Freezing on-street parking charges, cutting the price of residents’ parking permits\nA Liberal Democrat council will freeze on-street car parking charges across Gloucestershire. In residents’ parking permit zones Liberal Democrats will reduce the annual fee from £80 to £50.\n5. Making sure we can trust what we eat, protecting trading standards\nThe Tories have slashed spending on Trading Standards by 50% at a time when the service is under greatly increased pressure with the controversy over horse meat in beef products. It needs to be in the forefront of testing food products on sale locally. There will be no further cuts in Trading Standards under the Liberal Democrats.\n6.

The city council had planned to start construction this month and follow on with the planting of shrubs and plants in April.\nBut, Lib Dem councillors Jeremy Hilton and Isabel Brazil have been told that tenders haven’t even been issued for the work. Tenders have been delayed by the city council’s legal services team.\nCurrently, the garden is closed because it has become a location of problem street drinking. Adults have been drinking alcohol to excess, fighting and arguing between themselves, and using local residents’ front gardens as a toilet. The new garden layout has been designed to be more attractive and to discourage street drinking.\nCllr. Jeremy Hilton (Lib Dem – Kingsholm & Wotton) said: “The delay in construction of the new garden is disappointing, but this is becoming normal with projects run by Gloucester City Council. With so many jobs lost under the Tories’ austerity plan, there are not enough staff to process projects on time. This really is a ‘Vanishing Council’.\n“Isabel Brazil and I have worked hard to get an agreement for improvements to this problem garden. We secured funding to enable works to be done, but to be told last week that it is being delayed by the legal services team, is ridiculous. This is not a big project, but the red tape being applied may cost more than the budget for the actual ground work.”\nCllr. Isabel Brazil (Lib Dem – Kingsholm & Wotton) said: “A new Public Space Protection Order banning the drinking of alcohol in public spaces along London Road recently came into force. The second stage of our action plan is a new layout for the garden that should discourage street drinking. The city council needs to get on with this project.”",

Liberal Democrats had long called for a plan B, when it was obvious the original scheme was going nowhere. I welcome the new plan drawn up by the council’s consultants, which will be a genuine mixed use scheme.\nI am pleased that we shall retain Kings Square as a public open space and that it will not be built on as was the case in the original retail led scheme. However, there is still a lot of design work to do in making sure that the refurbished square is something we can all be proud of and enjoy.\nIt is critical that we get the layout of the development and the quality of the architecture right so that the development becomes an impressive gateway into the city centre from both the railway station and bus station. There will also be a new car park with 428 spaces and I hope the designers ensure that it will be a safe and pleasant place to use. The proposed hotel should also be of the quality that will boost Gloucester’s offer and attract people back to the city.\nKings Quarter should also be the location of a modern and good quality indoor market to replace the tired market at the Eastgate Shopping Centre. Markets need a good footfall and the development at Kings Quarter should provide a location near to the transport hubs for specialist market traders to thrive.\nIt will be important that the development is a high quality build and of a design that wins architectural awards. I believe the consultants have got it right in proposing four phases of the development. The inclusion of residential units in the plans must also be welcomed.\nFinally, I do think the city council cabinet has missed a golden opportunity to move its offices to the King’s Quarter. The cabinet is considering selling the offices at Herbert, Kimberly and Phillpotts warehouses and moving into Shire Hall. I think we should seriously consider building new council offices in the King’s Quarter, helping to kickstart the regeneration of this area just as we did in the 1980’s when we moved our offices to the Docks. The business plan does include up to 100,000 sq feet of office space.",

Gloucester’s magistrates court was rather dilapidated for several years before it finally closed,” Councillor Hilton, who represents Kingsholm Ward, said.\n“Gloucester’s crown court is a lovely 19th century building and a proper old courtroom but it is also in poor condition and needs updating.\n“If is justice is to be served then it needs to be accessible to everyone from across Gloucestershire.\n“With the new court located in the city centre it would be close to the bus and rail stations and also have good parking facilities.”\nCouncillor Hilton added: “A potential site for the new court building could be as part of the Kings Quarter development.\n“A new court in Gloucester could also mean that high-profile and more serious cases are dealt with in the city rather than people having to travel to Bristol.”",

Evidence shows raising the attainment of pupils by the end of primary schools has a direct impact on future exam results.\nLiberal Democrat county group leader, Cllr. Jeremy Hilton said:\n“Every child should be able to reach their full potential, whatever their background. The pupil premium will get extra money to schools in Gloucestershire, targeted at the children who need it most. The whole class benefits when fewer children are struggling.

He has fought the Gloucester seat three times before in 1987, 2005 and 2010. Mr Hilton currently serves as local councillor.\nJeremy Hilton was born and bred in Gloucester. He lives in the heart of the city close to the cathedral and vows that his fight is for a stronger and fairer Gloucester.\nCllr. Hilton has an excellent track record of public service, representing Kingsholm on both the city and county councils, where he is also the Liberal Democrat group leader. With over 22 years experience as a councillor, Jeremy is a local person ideally qualified to become Gloucester’s next MP.\nAs the current chairperson of the Local Government Association’s, Fire Service Management Committee, Jeremy is experienced in parliamentary matters. He has given verbal evidence to a House of Commons Select Committee.\nAs the Next MP for Gloucester, Jeremy Hilton will work hard for a strong economy and fairer society, by:-\n• campaigning for good education for all Gloucester children and free school meals for everyone at primary school\n• delivering better rail connections to Gloucester and a new central bus station\n• raising the income tax free allowance to £12,500 and securing the triple lock, in law, for state pensions\n• securing Gloucester’s regeneration with UNESCO World Heritage Site status for the cathedral, whilst building more affordable homes for young families\n• increasing the number apprenticeships for young people and ensuring a diverse and growing economy in Gloucester\n• guaranteeing equal care and waiting times for mental health as for physical health, by increasing spending on the NHS\nTory MP challenged over Europe\nHere is my letter to Richard Graham the Tory MP for Gloucester over his suggestion we have a referendum on Europe\nDear Richard\nI see from your email to me that you want a referendum on Europe, even though the coalition has passed legislation for this to happen if there are further transfers of power.\nWhy would you want to hold and in out referendum just for fun?

It is good for jobs and business. Good for international co-operation. In my lifetime, it has helped democratise many European countries. Membership of the European Union helps to protect the human rights of millions of people in Britain and across the continent.\nIf there is a referendum on Europe I shall be campaigning and voting to stay in. You may willing to appease UKIP, but I am not. Britain must retain its membership of the European Union. Why would you want to put our membership at risk!\nThe public in Gloucester need to know. If there was a referendum on the European Union, would you vote to stay in or get out?\nCllr. Jeremy Hilton\nKingsholm & Wotton\nLiberal Democrats Conference report – day four\nOn the day that Gloucester City Football Club secured planning permission for a new stadium at Meadow Park, Liberal Democrats were debating the future of football at our Glasgow conference. It was good to listen to my old friend Paul Baker, the chairman of Cheltenham Town FC, who has kindly provided the Tigers with a home in the last few years. The Tigers have been homeless for the last few years since the old ground was flooded back in 2007.\nFollowing on from this debate, delegates debated and voted on the party’s pre-manifesto policy paper “A Stronger Economy and a Fairer Society”. The debate was introduced by the Schools Minister, David Laws MP, who is also in charge of writing the party’s manifesto. He has been consulting members widely on what we want to do if in government again for the next 5 years.\nDavid Laws is the minster responsible for introducing Free School Meals for year one and two infant school children in September this year, saving a family £420 a year for every child in this age group. Liberal Democrats will extend free school meals to all children in primary education, as resources allow.\nLiberal Democrats Conference report – day three\nThe third day of the Liberal Democrat conference in Glasgow ended for me with my attendance at the South West Liberal Democrats reception held in the main conference hotel. This reception gave me an opportunity to hear short speeches from a number of South West MP’s and to meet members from other constituencies.\nDuring the day I also had a one to one meeting with an officer of the Association of Liberal Democrat Councillors to discuss the 2015 local election campaign in Gloucester. Next year we shall have elections to the city council on the same day as the general election. Polling Day, May the 7th, will be an important day for Gloucester and the country.\nIn his keynote speech to conference Vince Cable the Business Secretary cracked one of the best jokes of the day when he reminded delegates of the time when Gladstone spoke for five hours without notes, but didn’t forget what he was talking about, unlike the recent speech by Ed Miliband when he forgot to mention the deficit. Vince Cable also reminded conference how the coalition government had created almost 2 million apprenticeships since 2010.\nLiberal Democrats Conference report -day two\nThe major speech of the day came from the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander MP. As our senior Scottish MP in the cabinet, Danny started his speech by thanking everyone who helped in the Scottish Referendum, in support of the No campaign. He also reaffirmed Liberal Democrat policy that we should have votes for 16 & 17 year olds in all elections as they did in the referendum.\nDanny said Liberal Democrats should be proud that we gave the country strong government in 2010 at a time when we needed it most. He reminded delegates that Labour had bankrupted the country and that they should never be trusted to run the country by themselves again.\nSince the Liberal Democrats had been in government, 27 million people had benefited from income tax cuts by the raising of the threshold to £10,500. This is something David Cameron said could not be done during the 2010 election campaign. Danny Alexander said we would raise the tax free threshold to £12,500 in the next parliament. This could only be guaranteed to be done fairly by Liberal Democrats being in government next time.\nDanny Alexander said Liberal Democrats would borrow less than Labour and cut public spending less than the Tories. He said we would insist on a fairness rule on any changes to tax and benefits.\nLiberal Democrat Conference Report – day one\nLiberal Democrats are meeting in Glasgow for the annual conference. Saturday the conference started with hustings for the election of our new party President to take over from Tim Farron, who is stepping down. There are four candidates, former MEP Liz Lynne, Baroness Sal Brinton, Linda Jack and Daisy Cooper. The winning candidate will be chosen in a postal ballot of all party members.\nDuring the day passionate speeches were given by two senior Lib Dem government ministers Lynne Featherstone and Simon Hughes both highlighting the many achievements that have been made that would not have happened if the Lib Dems had not been in government. For instance, £35 million has now been given to tackle Female Genital Mutilation (FGM), scrapping of ID cards and reduced detention without charge to 28 days.\nThe highlight of the first day was the Conference Rally, which Jo Swinson, Paddy Ashdown and Nick Clegg spoke to a packed house in the main auditorium.\nNick Clegg told conference delegates that only the Liberal Democrats could provide Britain with a strong economy and a fairer society. He asked people to imagine what life would be like with a Tory or Labour majority government. The Tories could not deliver a fair society and Labour cannot be trusted on the economy. Liberal Democrats will fight “tooth and nail” to prevent either of them forming a majority government.\nLocally Liberal Democrats will be fighting hard to win so that we can deliver a stronger economy and fairer society here in Gloucester, as well.\nCouncil approves bid by residents to list Civil Service Sports ground as a community asset\nGloucester City Council has approved a second bid by local residents to make the former Civil Service Club in Kingsholm a community asset under the Community Right to Buy scheme. This would allow the community to buy the land if Redrow try to sell it. Redrow paid just £10,000 for the site in 2011.\nThe new bid provided comprehensive evidence that non-members as well as members regularly used the grounds and pavilion.\nBoth Liberal Democrat councillors, Jeremy Hilton and Sebastian Field provided written support for the bid and they are delighted that the city council has agreed to list the sports ground as a community asset.\nSebastian Field said: “There is a shortage of public open space in our ward as required by the city council’s open spaces strategy. The ownership of this land by the community would be a great benefit to our neighbourhood.”\nJeremy Hilton said: “The former Civil Service sports ground clearly is a community asset that we must save for sport and recreation. I am pleased that the land is now listed as a community asset giving residents of Kingsholm the first option to buy the land if Redrow try to sell it. The next step in our campaign is for the city council is to include the former civil service sports ground in its emerging open spaces strategy.”\nIntroduction of Free School Meals is Good News\nLiberal Democrats at Shire Hall are delighted that the Deputy Prime Minister’s free school meals initiative had the support of the council and is on track to be delivered from this September.\nThe free school meals policy, announced by the Liberal Democrat Leader and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg at the Liberal Democrat Autumn Conference last September will give all year 1 and 2 pupils free school meals.\nThe £450m funding in 2014/15 and £635m in 2015/2016 will be made available to the Department for Education to fund this commitment.\nThe equivalent of £2.30 for every meal served in Gloucestershire. A government grant of £1.2m is also being used to upgrade kitchen to deal with the 19,000 free school meals that will be served every day.\nCommenting, Leader of the Liberal Democrat Group, Cllr. Jeremy Hilton said that:\n“The introduction of free school meals for every single infant school pupil is a positive step in the right direction.\n“It is great initiative that will bring positive benefits encouraging positive eating habits and helping to improve concentration and performance in the classroom. It will also save families £420 per pupil per year.\n“I am disappointed that the Tories abstained in welcoming the free school meals initiative especially considering that nationally cross-party support has now been given for this policy”.\nENDS\nLiberal Democrats announce candidates for Gloucester City Council elections on May 22nd\nLiberal Democrats have announced who their candidates will be for the city council elections to be held on the 22nd May.

An inquest has opened into the deaths of two men who died after a tumble dryer caught fire.\nThe LGA is warning that companies who are running lengthy repair programmes for potentially dangerous machines, instead of recalling them, are risking the lives of millions of customers.\nIt is calling on manufacturers to recall affected tumble driers and for all white goods to have fire-proof markings on them, including the manufacturer, model and serial number, so they can be identified more easily if they are damaged after causing a fire.\nCllr Jeremy Hilton, Chair of the LGA’s Fire Services Management Committee, said:\n“People using faulty tumble dryers are unwittingly playing Russian roulette and leading manufacturers need to recall affected models as soon as possible to protect their customers.\n“Firefighters are attending tumble dryer fires three times a day, which is alarming. These defective products are endangering lives, causing thousands of pounds of damage to homes and making people homeless.\n“People’s safety must be the priority. It’s been months since some manufacturers issued safety warnings over their tumble dryers but they need to be recalled as these appliances are still causing fires – until they do so, consumers continue to risk falling victim to a devastating and tragic house fire.\n“Fire-proof markings on all white goods would also help improve manufacturing and safety standards by helping fire investigators identify the make and model of any appliance damaged after causing a fire.\n“Users must take simple precautions using tumble dryers. The compartment where fibres from fabric build up should be cleaned out after every load of clothes is dried, to reduce the risk of it igniting, and the vent or any other opening should not be covered.\n“People should never leave tumble driers on overnight or when they go out. Anyone buying an electrical item should complete the guarantee registration to ensure goods which do not meet safety specifications are repaired, replaced or refunded. This also enables manufacturers to contact owners in the event of a product recall.\n“People also need to ensure they have a working smoke alarm – which can be a life-saver – in the event something does go wrong and test them regularly, ideally once a week.”\nAnyone with concerns about the safety of electrical appliances can report them to the Citizens Advice consumer helpline on 03454 04 05 06.",

  "http_jeremyhilton_mycouncillor_org_uk_/https_jeremyhilton_mycouncillor_org_uk_category_local-issues/content_118.html": "Redrow Homes has appealed to the Secretary of State about Gloucester City Council’s non-determination of their planning application to build 89 dwellings on the former Civil Service Sports Ground off Estcourt Road. Application reference 16/00968/FUL.\nThis controversial application raised many objections from local residents when it was originally deposited with the council in 2016.\nThe deadline for comments to the Planning Inspectorate from the public was the 9th of August this year. Jeremy Hilton’s letter is below.\nGloucester City Council has still to respond. Within a few weeks the council will take its response to the planning committee for approval, before it is sent to the Planning Inspectorate.\nJeremy Hilton fighting to save the Civil Service Sports Ground\nJeremy Hilton’s Letter to Planning Inspectorate\nI write to ask you to dismiss the appeal by Redrow Homes related to the planning application for 89 houses on the former Civil Service Sports Club ground (Ref:16/00968/FUL).\nI am the local county and city councillor for Kingsholm & Wotton.\nOn the 19th of April 2017, I did write to the case officer at Gloucester City Council pointing out that the application was then seven months old and that it should be determined with a recommendation to refuse.\nThe council said they were giving more time to Redrow to resolve the issue about the loss of sports pitches. Redrow had not in April 2017 nor since provided evidence on how they would mitigate for the loss of the playing fields.\nThere is a shortage of rugby and football pitches in Gloucester. Spartans Ruby Club, which is based in Kingsholm, is looking for an additional pitch near to its club house, which is in neighbouring Sherborne Street.\nThe High School for Girls, which is in Denmark Road has also spoken to me about possible use of the sports field if it is saved from development.\nAll Redrow have done since acquiring the site in 2011 (for just £10,000) is shut the gates and demolish the club house etc, making the facilities unavailable for active sport that it had previously been used for.\nSimilarly, since acquiring the site Redrow have failed to properly discuss the future of the playing fields with the local community that is required in the Joint Core Strategy policy INF4. The lack of community engagement is lamentable.\nRedrow’s idea of consultation has been to lodge two full planning applications with the council, leaving no opportunity for the council or the community to hold discussions about how the site could be developed for some housing, but leaving the rest of the site available for sport and recreation.\nAs Keith Annis a senior manager at Redrow once told me they were playing for time. The question must be asked why has it taken them nearly two years from depositing the planning application to lodge an appeal?\nFor Redrow to appeal against non-determination is rather hypocritical, particularly to do this only a few weeks after lodging a new planning application for 100 dwellings on the same site (Ref 18/00306/FUL)\nFurther Comments\nA. Affordable housing:\nThe plan for affordable homes did not meet the council’s then standard, when the application was submitted, which was 40 %. The application lists 18 dwellings as intermediate housing, this is equates to 20% of the build.\nIt was impossible for the council to approve an application that did not meet this standard. Subsequently, the Joint Core Strategy has been adopted, where the new limit is set at 20%.\nB. Land Purchase:\nThe applicants purchased the sports ground from the Civil Service Sports Council Ltd for just £10,000 in 2011 (GR355501). The applicants should publicly declare the details of the uplift clause they have with Civil Service Sports Council Ltd.\nI believe it is this legal agreement that is responsible for the maximisation of housing on the site rather than what one would expect an open discussion with the council and community on a development brief that would benefit all.\nSome degree of housing whilst retaining the main sports field for sport and recreation, would benefit everyone.\nC. Alternative sport provision:\nIt may be that the land has not been used for sport for more than five years, but that is because of a deliberate policy by the landowners to close the ground for sporting activities.\nI concur with Sport England that the application should be refused.\nThe applicants have failed to identify alternative facilities that could accommodate sporting activities that previously took place on the Civil Service Sports ground.\nIn my opinion, alternative provision must be within the Kingsholm & Wotton ward.\nD. Joint Core Strategy INF3\nThe proposed development of 89 dwellings in my opinion is not consistent with JCS policy on green infrastructure. The former Civil Service Sport Ground provides a worthy green infrastructure asset that should be protected to help resolve the shortage of open space in Kingsholm and Wotton.\nI believe it is not beyond the wit of all parties to come up with a development solution that would provide much needed housing whilst retaining a large open space that could continue to be used for sport and recreation.\nHere is Policy INF3\n1. The green infrastructure network of local and strategic importance will be conserved and enhanced, in order to deliver a series of multifunctional, linked green corridors across the JCS area by:\ni. Improving the quantity and/or quality of assets;\nii. Improving linkages between assets in a manner appropriate to the scale of development, and\niii. Designing improvements in a way that supports the cohesive management of green\ninfrastructure;\n2. Development proposals should consider and contribute positively towards green infrastructure, including the wider landscape context and strategic corridors between major assets and populations. Where new residential development will create, or add to, a need for publicly accessible green space or outdoor space for sports and recreational on, this will be fully met in accordance with Policy INF4. Development at Strategic Alloca ons will be required to deliver connectivity through the site, linking urban areas with the wider rural hinterland\n3. Existing green infrastructure will be protected in a manner that reflects its contribution\nto ecosystem services (including biodiversity, landscape / townscape quality, the historic environment, public access, recreation and play) and the connectivity of the green infrastructure network. Development proposals that will have an impact on woodlands, hedges and trees will need to include a jus ca on for why this impact cannot be avoided and should incorporate measures acceptable to the Local Planning Authority to mi gate the loss. Mi ga on should be provided on-site or, where this is not possible, in the immediate environs of the site\n4. Where assets are created, retained or replaced within a scheme, they should be properly integrated into the design and contribute to local character and distinctiveness. Proposals should also make provisions for future maintenance of green infrastructure.\nE. Joint Core Strategy INF4\nAs I have previously mentioned the lack of serious community engagement by Redrow ahead of this planning application, about the future use of the site, is lamentable.\nRedrow have only showed plans that have proposed the complete building on the site, with the loss of the playing fields. They have never properly consulted anyone.\nI believe they failed to meet the requirement of Joint Core Strategy policy INF4 for social and community infrastructure\nHere is Policy INF4\n1. Proposals to develop land or buildings currently or previously in use as a community facility will demonstrate, including evidence of engagement with relevant local community groups and partner organisations, why the facility is no longer required and, as appropriate, how, when and where suitable local replacement facilities will be provided. Provision of replacement facilities will have regard to the locational and other relevant elements of this policy\n2. Where new residential development will create, or add to, a need for community facilities, it will be fully met as on-site provision and/or as a contribution to facilities or services o -site. New or refurbished provision will be of an appropriate type, standard and size. From an early stage, developers will be expected to engage with the relevant local authorities and infrastructure providers and, as appropriate, relevant local community groups where they exist, to ensure that new provision meets the needs of the community that it will serve and is t for purpose\n3. Social and community infrastructure should be centrally located to the population it serves and\nbe easily accessible on foot and by bicycle. It should be located so as to have the potential to be well-served by public transport. Developers should aim to provide flexible, multifunctional facilities within mixed-use developments, creating shared space which maximises benefits to the community and minimises land-take. In the case of open space, ‘easily accessible’ means it is located within reasonable walking distance of the development it serves. New facilities should be accessible to all members of the community, and be planned and phased in parallel with new development.\nF. Draft City Plan Policy SA06\nThe provision of 89 dwellings is in my opinion is overdevelopment of the site, which is in the heart of Kingsholm.\nCouncil policy as identified in the draft City Plan, which was approved by council in December 2016, recommends a maximum of twenty dwellings (SA06).\nThe proposal of 89 dwellings exceeds this policy by 445%, with the complete loss of the playing fields.\nA compromise of 40 dwellings, for example, on this site would mean that the former sports field could be brought back into use.\nG. Layout of the site:\nThe layout of the site does not follow the usual street pattern that is evident in Kingsholm. It is adjacent to both the Kingsholm and Denmark Road conservation areas.\nI am concerned that the narrow streets on estate may be become clogged up with motorists parking their cars on footpaths. This is a problem that will be exacerbated during times when there are rugby matches being played at the Kingsholm stadium.\nThe small public open space is set out to give the impression that it is an exclusive space just for the new residents of the estate. New public open space should laid out to be inclusive and available to all Kingsholm residents.\nH. Highway access:\nI am not convinced by the design of the access point onto Estcourt Road slip road.\nThe proposed access onto Denmark Road is unacceptable. It closes the slip road to Lansdown Road and removes much-needed parking spaces on Denmark Road.\nThe closure of the slip road will create more vehicle conflict at the other junction with Lansdown Road. This will be a particular problem when school coaches use this junction.\nThe closure of the slip road will also remove the u-turn provision it provides for the houses serviced off the dual carriageway section of Denmark Road on the south side.\nI. Public open space:\nKingsholm & Wotton has a low level of public open space as identified in the city council’s open spaces strategy. The council’s standard is 2.8ha per 1000\nBased on the new ward boundaries introduced at the 2016 election the ward has just 0.49ha per 1,000 population. Or 3.59ha for a population based on mid 2016 of 7,259 persons.\nAn opportunity is being missed in the proposed development to achieve a good increase in public open space provision in the ward by the wholesale development of the site, which was formerly used for sport and recreation.\nI would recommend that this appeal is dismissed.",

The council would buy back the ownership of Llanthony Secunda Priory for just one pound. This is a better solution than handing the priory over to the Official Receiver should the Llanthony Secunda Priory Trust become insolvent.”\nA successful trust today is not necessarily a successful trust tomorrow. We must protect the future of one of Gloucester’s most historic assets. The cabinet decision must be reconsidered and that is why Liberal Democrat councillors have called-in the decision so that it can be reconsidered.”\nCall-in notice\n“This is a request to call-in the cabinet decision made on the 11th of September, in relation to agenda item 12 – Llanthony Secunda Priory. The call-in is supported by members of the council who have acknowledged their support for this particular call-in via email.\nThe decision of cabinet was as follows:\n- That the restrictive covenants be removed in accordance with the request from LSPT.\n- That Planning Committee be requested to vary the S106 agreement relating to the property.\n- That the above are subject to agreeing a provision for continuing public access to the property and that the City Council shall have the continued right to nominate a Trustee.\nAhead of the cabinet decision Cllr. Jeremy Hilton did raise his concerns, at group leaders meeting (2nd September) about the proposal to remove covenants the council holds on Llanthony Secunda Priory and also to waive the original Section 106 Agreement.\nOn the 9th of September Cllr. Hilton wrote to the leader of the council asking him to withdraw the cabinet paper so that further discussion could take place. The leader responded negatively to Cllr. Hilton’s request and did not withdraw the cabinet paper. He suggested that if Cllr Hilton was not happy with his decision then Cllr Hilton should call-in the decision.\nThe original decision to sell Llanthony Secunda Priory to a management trust was made at full council on the 15th of February 2007.\nIn making the decision council agreed to the following clause:-\n‘To covenant the site so that should the Management Trust fail, ownership of the monument and its grounds would revert to the Council.’\nThe matter of whether council should remove the covenants it holds on Llanthony Secunda Priory is therefore a matter for full council and not cabinet.\n- The covenants were put there for the benefit of the city\n- The possibility of the trust failing was in the original risk assessment. This was mitigated by the covenant relating to the transfer of the land back to the council should the management trust fail.\n- The decision to go ahead with the trust was done on the understanding that this safeguard would remain.\n- A successful trust today is not necessarily a successful trust tomorrow.\n- To remove the covenant now would not therefore be in the best interests of the city as it could potentially put the future of one of Gloucester’s most important historical assets at risk.\nThe signatories to the call-in request that the decision of cabinet is reviewed in particular the resolution to remove the covenants that this council holds on Llanthony Secunda Priory.”",

The facility will have staff on duty 24/7.\nThe young persons’ facility will have a health assessment unit, an educational day service and apartments for young people to be able to learn the skills of daily living to prepare them for adulthood. It will be inspected by Ofsted and the Care Quality Commission.\nThe county council held a public consultation on the 15th of May and another is planned during August.\nHere are the set of questions from Jeremy Hilton that took place at cabinet on the 24th of April. First set is the written questions and answers. The second set are the verbal supplementary questions and answers.\nThe cabinet report can be read online, click here:\nhttp://glostext.gloucestershire.gov.uk/documents/s51904/Item%2011%20-%20Gloucestershires%20Sufficiceny%20Strategy%20-%20Semi-Independent%20Project.pdf\nQuestion 1 – Jeremy Hilton\nThe report says the proposed remodelling of Trevone House will provide a resource centre for children and young people, provision of a health assessment unit, an educational day service and apartments for young people to be able to learn the skills of daily living to prepare them for adulthood. I agree that such a facility for young people in care is required in Gloucestershire, but what other properties in the county were considered and where are they located?\nAnswer 1 – Richard Boyles\nChildren Services over the past few years have considered a number of options in relation to providing provision of placements for children and young people in county. This has included looking at existing buildings, as well as purchasing new provision, both in urban and more rural areas. Unfortunately, these searches did not identify any potential properties with the scope that is being offered from using Trevone House. This project is innovative in its design, offering a multi agency approach to our young people. Because of this, it needs to be centrally located, accessible both for young people to access community resources, but also for staff and partners.\nQuestion 2 – Jeremy Hilton\nI was only briefed about this proposal on the 11th of April 2019, the day before the cabinet report was published. Local residents haven’t been consulted. What plans do you have to fully consult local residents, other care institutions and local schools based in Kingsholm? And will they be listened to?\nAnswer 2 – Richard Boyles\nA communications plan will be implemented, to engage with and listen to local residents, so that everyone has an opportunity to share their views. Our young ambassadors will be part of this process, bringing to life their journeys, working together not only for the development of this project but also for the life time of the provision, to reduce anxiety, mitigate risks and promote community cohesion.\nQuestion 3 – Jeremy Hilton\nIn paragraph 3.2, the report says that this proposal will provide accommodation for 16-20 year olds. Can you provide me with an assurance that no person will be placed at Trevone House who is over the age of 20 years?\nAnswer 3 – Richard Boyles\nThis project is to support young people moving onto independence from the age of 16 years, planning for them to move on to independent accommodation. In exceptional circumstances, where young people need more time or support due to their learning or emotional needs, consideration would be given for them to remain in placement post 20 years. These young people would have a robust transition plan in place.\nQuestion 4 – Jeremy Hilton\nWill the new young persons facility at Trevone House be a single gender provision? If not, what spilt in genders is expected?\nAnswer 4 – Richard Boyles\nThe accommodation will be co-ed, but this will be in the context of a needs lead service and planned placements. Placement matching is key to the success of this project and a panel will be in place to review placement referrals. This will be multi agency, with colleagues from Health, Police, Children’s Services and the provider. The panel will not only review the placement referrals, it will also monitor the young people in placement.\nQuestion 5 – Jeremy Hilton\nOn Radio Gloucestershire, (8am on 15th April 2019), Cllr Mark Hawthorne stated that there would be a minimum of 4 members staff on duty 24/7. Is this correct and how many staff will be on duty during the day and over the night?\nAnswer 5 – Richard Boyles\nThe whole concept of this project is to support and enable our young people to flourish and be aspirational in developing their plans for adulthood. Therefore, staffing is critical, not only in the numbers but the quality and skills of the staff team. There will be a minimum of four staff on duty at any one time, across the whole project. At times, where needed, there will be more staff on duty for those young people who need higher levels of support. Parts of the tendering process will require potential providers to evidence their staffs skills and training and supervision standards to ensure they meet the requirements of this. Given the nature of the project, there will be additional staff during the day to deliver the day service provision. The project will also have capacity to bring in additional staff as required and to support young people in distress, particularly those in need of health assessments\nThe following supplementary questions were asked at the meeting\nSupplementary Question 1 – Jeremy Hilton\nCllr Hilton referred to the large number of care institutions based in Kingsholm and stated how important it was not to overload the community with such facilities. Seeking clarification on the answer to his question, Cllr Hilton asked what other properties in the county had been considered as possible locations for a young person’s facility? Cllr Hilton asked Cllr Boyles to provide a written answer to the question, including the reasons why the locations had been dismissed as suitable premises.\nResponse by: Cllr Richard Boyles (Cabinet Member for Children and Young People)\nCllr Boyles explained that the project to provide a young person’s facility as was proposed four years ago under the IRIS project. After the Ofsted Inspection in 2017, a key part of Gloucestershire’s Sufficiency Strategy expanded the need for a wider range of local accommodation options. Cllr Boyles explained that some of the properties that had originally been considered were no longer suitable . The Gloucestershire Sufficiency Strategy aimed to cater for young people in the community. Cllr Boyles agreed to provide Cllr Hilton with a written response to his question after the meeting. He stated that, as the terms of the project grew, so did the terms of requirement.\nSupplementary Question 2 – Jeremy Hilton\nCllr Hilton acknowledged there was a communications plan but stressed the importance of consulting with the local community. Cllr Hilton asked for assurance that consultation had been done?\nResponse by: Cllr Richard Boyles\nCllr Boyles referred to the clear communications plan which set out the engagements that would be undertaken with the local community on a wide range of issues associated with the project, including bus services, schools and hospitals. Cllr Boyles agreed to provide a written response to the question after the meeting and assured Cllr Hilton the views of the local community would be listened to.\nSupplementary Question 3 – Jeremy Hilton\nCllr Hilton stated that, in the UK, a person reached maturity and was regarded as an adult by the time of their 18th birthday. Cllr Hilton asked Cllr Boyles to guarantee no new person over the age of 20 would be placed at Trevone House and that no one over age 20 would spend their first night in care at the house?\nResponse by: Cllr Richard Boyles\nCllr Boyles stated he was unable to promise that no one over the age of 20 would be placed at Trevone House. He explained some placements could roll over beyond the age of 18 and that he would need to consult with the team on the matter. Cllr Boyles did not envisage anyone over the age of 20 would be placed at the facility but could not give a definite yes or no at this time.\nSupplementary Question 4 – Jeremy Hilton\nCllr Hilton noted that the Care Quality Commission and Ofsted were regulators of the facility and asked how often and how rigorous were their inspections expected to be?\nResponse by: Cllr Richard Boyles\nCllr Boyles confirmed the inspections would be as rigorous as always and that the inspection reports would be available as and when the information was provided. The inspections would be annual but may be more frequent.\nSupplementary Question 5 – Jeremy Hilton\nCllr Hilton referred to a recent briefing with Cllr Boyles and the indication there would only be two people on duty overnight. Cllr Hilton also referred to a recent radio interview given by the Leader of the Council, Cllr Mark Hawthorne, where it was suggested there would be 4 members of staff on duty 24/7. Cllr Hilton sought clarification on how many members of staff would be on duty at the facility from 9pm to 9am?\nResponse by: Cllr Richard Boyles\nCllr Boyles confirmed there would be 4 members of staff on duty, once the facility was fully open. Until this time, and as the facility developed, the number of staff could be lower, dependent on the number of residents. Cllr Boyles said that everything would be risk assessed, with additional staff brought in if the risk was deemed appropriate.",

The current plan is for the city council to be based on the fifth floor at Shire Hall from 1st April 2019. Shire Hall is the headquarters of the county council.\nThe Liberal Democrat group says the business planning behind the project is ill thought out and the office accommodation will be temporary, too small and the financial savings unsound.\nLib Dem group leader, Cllr. Jeremy Hilton said:\n“Gloucester City Council under Conservative control really is becoming a ‘vanishing council’. The council lacks ambition and is unable to plan long term. The Conservative administration is exhausted and has run out of good ideas. Moving to Shire Hall is a desperate stop gap position. It attempts to save money but doesn’t. The move should be suspended to allow for a full reappraisal.\n“The accommodation at Shire Hall and 92-96 Westgate Street amounts to just 1,175 sqm. This is 78% smaller in size compared to the 5,290 sqm at Herbert, Kimberley and Phillpotts warehouses at the Docks. The Tory cabinet has still not provided opposition councillors with the plans on how it will all be squeezed into such a small space. The public reception advice centre on Westgate Street will be tiny, just 123 sqm compared to current 377 sqm.\n“The council has yet to secure an agreement with the Canals & River Trust about altering the covenant on Herbert, Kimberley and Phillpotts warehouses. Until this is sorted, the buildings cannot be put up for sale. We must not leave these grade II listed buildings empty whilst we find a buyer. In the past, two empty warehouses in the Docks have been destroyed by arson. This could happen again. We should not move out until we have sold the buildings to new owners who have obtained planning permission.\n“The city council needs to acquire new accommodation for the long term. It requires space to grow, especially if the council ends the Amey streetcare contract and brings the service back in house. We should build new offices in the Kings Quarter next to the new bus station. This would help kickstart the regeneration of the immediate area. It would be a bold move repeating the success of the council’s move to the Docks in the 1980’s.\nLib Dem deputy leader, Declan Wilson agreed:\n“The move to Shire Hall is poorly thought out. The financial savings are unsound. The council will still have to pay business rates, the Docks service charge, insurance and security amounting to well over £250,000 per year on HKP warehouses until they have been sold. This is more than double the £102,000 savings suggested in the cabinet report. The council must reassess. The business plan is flawed.”",

He has given verbal evidence to a House of Commons Select Committee.\nAs the Next MP for Gloucester, Jeremy Hilton will work hard for a strong economy and fairer society, by:-\n• campaigning for good education for all Gloucester children and free school meals for everyone at primary school\n• delivering better rail connections to Gloucester and a new central bus station\n• raising the income tax free allowance to £12,500 and securing the triple lock, in law, for state pensions\n• securing Gloucester’s regeneration with UNESCO World Heritage Site status for the cathedral, whilst building more affordable homes for young families\n• increasing the number apprenticeships for young people and ensuring a diverse and growing economy in Gloucester\n• guaranteeing equal care and waiting times for mental health as for physical health, by increasing spending on the NHS\nTory MP challenged over Europe\nHere is my letter to Richard Graham the Tory MP for Gloucester over his suggestion we have a referendum on Europe\nDear Richard\nI see from your email to me that you want a referendum on Europe, even though the coalition has passed legislation for this to happen if there are further transfers of power.\nWhy would you want to hold and in out referendum just for fun? The uncertainty would create instability in the economy and discourage inward investment. Many jobs in Gloucester could be put at risk.\nMembership of the European Union is good for Britain. It is good for jobs and business. Good for international co-operation. In my lifetime, it has helped democratise many European countries. Membership of the European Union helps to protect the human rights of millions of people in Britain and across the continent.\nIf there is a referendum on Europe I shall be campaigning and voting to stay in. You may willing to appease UKIP, but I am not. Britain must retain its membership of the European Union. Why would you want to put our membership at risk!\nThe public in Gloucester need to know. If there was a referendum on the European Union, would you vote to stay in or get out?\nCllr. Jeremy Hilton\nKingsholm & Wotton\nLiberal Democrats Conference report – day four\nOn the day that Gloucester City Football Club secured planning permission for a new stadium at Meadow Park, Liberal Democrats were debating the future of football at our Glasgow conference. It was good to listen to my old friend Paul Baker, the chairman of Cheltenham Town FC, who has kindly provided the Tigers with a home in the last few years. The Tigers have been homeless for the last few years since the old ground was flooded back in 2007.\nFollowing on from this debate, delegates debated and voted on the party’s pre-manifesto policy paper “A Stronger Economy and a Fairer Society”. The debate was introduced by the Schools Minister, David Laws MP, who is also in charge of writing the party’s manifesto. He has been consulting members widely on what we want to do if in government again for the next 5 years.\nDavid Laws is the minster responsible for introducing Free School Meals for year one and two infant school children in September this year, saving a family £420 a year for every child in this age group. Liberal Democrats will extend free school meals to all children in primary education, as resources allow.\nLiberal Democrats Conference report – day three\nThe third day of the Liberal Democrat conference in Glasgow ended for me with my attendance at the South West Liberal Democrats reception held in the main conference hotel. This reception gave me an opportunity to hear short speeches from a number of South West MP’s and to meet members from other constituencies.\nDuring the day I also had a one to one meeting with an officer of the Association of Liberal Democrat Councillors to discuss the 2015 local election campaign in Gloucester. Next year we shall have elections to the city council on the same day as the general election. Polling Day, May the 7th, will be an important day for Gloucester and the country.\nIn his keynote speech to conference Vince Cable the Business Secretary cracked one of the best jokes of the day when he reminded delegates of the time when Gladstone spoke for five hours without notes, but didn’t forget what he was talking about, unlike the recent speech by Ed Miliband when he forgot to mention the deficit. Vince Cable also reminded conference how the coalition government had created almost 2 million apprenticeships since 2010.\nLiberal Democrats Conference report -day two\nThe major speech of the day came from the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander MP. As our senior Scottish MP in the cabinet, Danny started his speech by thanking everyone who helped in the Scottish Referendum, in support of the No campaign. He also reaffirmed Liberal Democrat policy that we should have votes for 16 & 17 year olds in all elections as they did in the referendum.\nDanny said Liberal Democrats should be proud that we gave the country strong government in 2010 at a time when we needed it most. He reminded delegates that Labour had bankrupted the country and that they should never be trusted to run the country by themselves again.\nSince the Liberal Democrats had been in government, 27 million people had benefited from income tax cuts by the raising of the threshold to £10,500. This is something David Cameron said could not be done during the 2010 election campaign. Danny Alexander said we would raise the tax free threshold to £12,500 in the next parliament. This could only be guaranteed to be done fairly by Liberal Democrats being in government next time.\nDanny Alexander said Liberal Democrats would borrow less than Labour and cut public spending less than the Tories. He said we would insist on a fairness rule on any changes to tax and benefits.\nLiberal Democrat Conference Report – day one\nLiberal Democrats are meeting in Glasgow for the annual conference. Saturday the conference started with hustings for the election of our new party President to take over from Tim Farron, who is stepping down. There are four candidates, former MEP Liz Lynne, Baroness Sal Brinton, Linda Jack and Daisy Cooper. The winning candidate will be chosen in a postal ballot of all party members.\nDuring the day passionate speeches were given by two senior Lib Dem government ministers Lynne Featherstone and Simon Hughes both highlighting the many achievements that have been made that would not have happened if the Lib Dems had not been in government. For instance, £35 million has now been given to tackle Female Genital Mutilation (FGM), scrapping of ID cards and reduced detention without charge to 28 days.\nThe highlight of the first day was the Conference Rally, which Jo Swinson, Paddy Ashdown and Nick Clegg spoke to a packed house in the main auditorium.\nNick Clegg told conference delegates that only the Liberal Democrats could provide Britain with a strong economy and a fairer society. He asked people to imagine what life would be like with a Tory or Labour majority government. The Tories could not deliver a fair society and Labour cannot be trusted on the economy. Liberal Democrats will fight “tooth and nail” to prevent either of them forming a majority government.\nLocally Liberal Democrats will be fighting hard to win so that we can deliver a stronger economy and fairer society here in Gloucester, as well.\nCouncil approves bid by residents to list Civil Service Sports ground as a community asset\nGloucester City Council has approved a second bid by local residents to make the former Civil Service Club in Kingsholm a community asset under the Community Right to Buy scheme. This would allow the community to buy the land if Redrow try to sell it. Redrow paid just £10,000 for the site in 2011.\nThe new bid provided comprehensive evidence that non-members as well as members regularly used the grounds and pavilion.\nBoth Liberal Democrat councillors, Jeremy Hilton and Sebastian Field provided written support for the bid and they are delighted that the city council has agreed to list the sports ground as a community asset.\nSebastian Field said: “There is a shortage of public open space in our ward as required by the city council’s open spaces strategy. The ownership of this land by the community would be a great benefit to our neighbourhood.”\nJeremy Hilton said: “The former Civil Service sports ground clearly is a community asset that we must save for sport and recreation. I am pleased that the land is now listed as a community asset giving residents of Kingsholm the first option to buy the land if Redrow try to sell it. The next step in our campaign is for the city council is to include the former civil service sports ground in its emerging open spaces strategy.”\nIntroduction of Free School Meals is Good News\nLiberal Democrats at Shire Hall are delighted that the Deputy Prime Minister’s free school meals initiative had the support of the council and is on track to be delivered from this September.\nThe free school meals policy, announced by the Liberal Democrat Leader and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg at the Liberal Democrat Autumn Conference last September will give all year 1 and 2 pupils free school meals.\nThe £450m funding in 2014/15 and £635m in 2015/2016 will be made available to the Department for Education to fund this commitment.\nThe equivalent of £2.30 for every meal served in Gloucestershire. A government grant of £1.2m is also being used to upgrade kitchen to deal with the 19,000 free school meals that will be served every day.\nCommenting, Leader of the Liberal Democrat Group, Cllr. Jeremy Hilton said that:\n“The introduction of free school meals for every single infant school pupil is a positive step in the right direction.\n“It is great initiative that will bring positive benefits encouraging positive eating habits and helping to improve concentration and performance in the classroom. It will also save families £420 per pupil per year.\n“I am disappointed that the Tories abstained in welcoming the free school meals initiative especially considering that nationally cross-party support has now been given for this policy”.\nENDS\nLiberal Democrats announce candidates for Gloucester City Council elections on May 22nd\nLiberal Democrats have announced who their candidates will be for the city council elections to be held on the 22nd May. The party will be fielding candidates in all wards. The Liberal Democrats will be defending four seats.\nCllr. Jeremy Hilton (Kingsholm & Wotton), Cllr. Phil McLellan (Barnwood), Cllr.

On 20th July the city council will debate a motion by the Liberal Democrats calling for street cleaning to be improved. The Lib Dems are demanding details of the cleaning schedules for every street in the city so that weaknesses in the contract with Amey can be identified.\nThe move is coming from Kingsholm & Wotton councillors who are fed up with the council’s failure to keep the streets clean. They say that no one knows how often each street should be cleaned and litter removed.\nIsabel Brazil said: “We are not at all happy with the street cleaning in Kingsholm and it is no better in other neighbourhoods near to city centre. We must know exactly how often the Amey contract says a street, footpath or open space should be cleared of litter.”\nWard colleague Jeremy Hilton agreed: “There is a distinct difference in the cleaning regime from the city centre to those areas close to the city centre. I’m fed up with seeing litter around Kingsholm and other areas in Gloucester. The Tories and their contractors are letting us down. We are demanding that the cabinet puts forward a improvement plan and lets councillors know how often each street in their ward is contracted to be cleaned.”\nEnds…\nMotion by Jeremy Hilton seconded by Isabel Brazil\n“This council agrees that the level of street cleaning could be much better than it is and that the level of cleanliness in Gloucester is not up to the standard we would expect for an historic city.\nThis council calls on the Cabinet Member to provide each city councillor with full details of the cleaning regime in their wards, with details of how often each street, open space and public footpath is cleaned.\nThis council calls on the cabinet member to provide a report on how he intends to improve street cleaning in Gloucester, looking at three zones; the city centre, edge of the city centre and the suburbs.",

This will be the third application, following on from approval given by the county council in 2011 and 2013. This time the application is for three more years.\nThe application proposes to continue with the same operating hours, but permission is sought to increase the height of the stockpile from 4m to 6m. Twenty lorries a day are expected to make visits to the site, with a maximum of 20,000 tonnes of inert waste per annum.\nLiberal Democrat county councillor for the area, Jeremy Hilton (Kingsholm & Wotton) will oppose the application. He said: “I am not at all happy with this application that seeks to continue stone crushing for another three years. The county council has failed to enforce the condition limiting the stockpile height to just 4 metres.\n“The dust and noise close to residential properties is unwanted. After four years, I had hoped that Allstone would have found a more acceptable site to carry out this sort of process. The site is close to homes at Swallow Park and Armscroft Estate. It is near St Peter’s Primary School and the hospital is also in the area. Horton Road is already heavily congested and does not need more lorries travelling along it.\n“The proposal to increase the stockpile of stone from four to six metres will only exacerbate the risk of dust problems. The stockpile is just a few metres away from people’s homes.\nCllr Hilton has asked county planning officers to insist on an Environmental Impact Assessment, as the applicants think this is not required.\nResidents can post comments online at: www.gloucestershire.gov.uk/planning – Ref No. 15/0077/GLMAJW",

Lib Dems have described the ‘garden waste tax’ as ‘daylight robbery’. They blame the Conservative council and government in equal proportion.\nThe current charge for garden waste collection is £36 per year. The charge was introduced in 2011 to cover the cost of collection on this non-statutory service. Lib Dems discovered in 2016 that the council was profiteering from the collection by around £6 per bin, making a profit of £110,000 a year. The Tories now propose to increase the charge to £44.\nLib Dem leader, Jeremy Hilton said: “Last year we tried to reduce the charge to £31 to just cover the cost of collection. Both Labour and Tory councillors rejected our proposal. Now the Conservatives plan to increase the charge to £44. This is a tax on responsible householders who recycle their garden waste. It’s daylight robbery.”\nLib Dem Deputy leader, Declan Wilson said: “The council’s finances are dire and the Tories are penalising responsible householders. We should be encouraging recycling not taxing it. The Tories will be making a profit of £13 on every green bin. This a profit margin of 30%. Local gardeners are going to have to empty their pockets to cover the financial mismanagement of the council by the Conservatives. It’s unfair.”"
