This academic year, the Prize has been working in partnership with Rethinking Poverty to support young people to write in response to the theme ‘The Future We Want’. Committed to hearing from young people with diverse experiences across the UK, the Prize collaborated with another Rethinking Poverty partner, #thehullwewant, a partnership of organisations working with young people and communities and, in particular, its host the Youth Work and Community Development team at the University of Hull, Together, the Orwell Youth Prize and #thehullwewant delivered a youth forum on the Hull campus in March. The thinking, discussions and outputs that came from the Future Forum are the subject of these blogs, where I look back and reflect on the continuing relevance and urgency of the points raised by young people earlier this year, in the changed world we are now living in.\nIn early March, when hand sanitiser was in short supply and the decision to elbow bump was a conversation-starting novelty, and the scale and extent to which our lives would change had not yet hit us, the Orwell Youth Prize brought together local sixth formers, activists, artists and writers to discuss and present their ideas on the ‘Future We Want’ at the University of Hull. The task set was deliberately challenging. Groups were assigned areas of focus – climate, technology, education and community – and had just under the length of a school day to identify and prioritise problems and to work collaboratively to communicate ideas for change in their assigned area. We weren’t seeking slick solutions, but persuasive arguments and creative delivery. Both were achieved in abundance and welcomed by a receptive audience that included Emma Hardy MP and Bishop Alison White.\nDays like that in Hull give the Orwell Youth Prize clarity and momentum. Our small but punchy interventions are key to ensuring we are able to support new voices to think and write from their own experiences, while grounded in an understanding of the more complex structures that underpin the society we’re all a part of. Post Hull, though, in the immediate aftermath of lockdown, clarity gave way to confusion, and momentum was brought to a thumping halt. Now grounded in our domestic spheres – albeit with rolling newsfeeds and a new vocabulary (self-isolation, social distancing, Zoom …) – the prize’s ability to support young people to write about a better future was thrown into question. We were also troubled by the sense that thinking about ‘The Future We Want’ seemed like an invitation to romanticise the past we just had.\nAnother pressure, experienced by so many, was the immediate expectation (and need) to have a stance: a race to publish a lockdown plan littered with concerns and well wishes, the likes of which feature in Jessica Salfia’s viral poem. The Orwell Youth Prize (and the Orwell Foundation) is lucky that as a small organisation, supported by flexible partners and funders, its staff were able to breathe and take stock. In these last few weeks, our role and potential to act with purpose and renewed energy has come into view. At a time when teachers are seeking support and students will likely be questioning the relevance of the standard curriculum, we have extended our call for writing on ‘The Future We Want’ and added new resources and ideas that ask questions of now.\nAlongside this, the relevance and importance of ideas discussed and actions taken in the months before coronavirus have become more pronounced. As Barry Knight articulated, we must ‘#BuildBackBetter’, but I would also add that we must look back better. So all these weeks after Hull, I’m returning to the work of our Future Forum attendees and asking questions of it in light of this new shifted reality. The topics that underpinned our day of discussions have taken on a new significance in the stories emerging locally and globally in the wake of the virus.\nIn the space of a school day in Hull, the Orwell Youth Prize witnessed a generation with energy to propel change and the confidence to challenge the status quo, speaking eloquently and constructively to an audience with power. The insight, perceptiveness and experience of demonstrated by these young people provides us with more evidence that their generation must be given agency and a voice in forging a fairer society. Whatever our post-Covid settlement, it cannot be one that ignores those whose lives (arguably) will be most shaped by its impact. The ideas of young people must shape our responses and priorities for the ‘new normal’ we will construct in the wake of the global crisis.\nAnd so, in four blogs, I will look backwards to the ideas, experiences and wisdom of young people around those four key subjects: climate, community, technology and education.\nThe Future Forum was a good start, but as we have regained momentum we are committed to returning to Hull and strengthening our partnership with #thehullwewant. Furthermore, since lockdown, the youth prize has received a record amount of entries from more places and more young people than ever before. If you know a young person with something to say, there’s still time to enter: the prize is open until 11 June. All have a voice to add to the shaping of the society they are seeking and all deserve a hearing. Their ideas will help all of us step closer to ‘The Future We Want’.\nAlex Talbott is Programme Manager for The Orwell Youth Prize",

These Buckthorn trees attract the Brimstone butterfly, one of the most beautiful of our species in the UK. With this mass planting in the first year of what we aim to be an on -going project, beginning with the adoption of the sulphur-yellow Brimstone butterfly. A healthy Buckthorn is all the Brimstone’s caterpillar needs to grow happily. The decline in insects is dramatic and already impacting on pollination. Bees love the tiny Buckthorn flowers as well so the more the merrier.\nThe country is in a climate crisis and by raising awareness of the issue and starting this project we are taking steps towards helping Hull become a greener place to be.\nSo come join us at Trinity Square from 1-3pm Saturday 26th October and find our more about what we can all achieve together in making our city a cleaner, greener place to live.

  "https_www_emmahardy_org_uk_/https_www_emmahardy_org_uk_2019_04_01_week-ahead-1st-april-2019/content_179.html": "Week Ahead- 1st April 2019\nMonday\nOn Monday, I will be returning to Parliament where I will meet with Labour’s Brexit team. The main order of business is the second set of indicative votes by MPs to try to find a way out of the deadlock surrounding Brexit. At the time of writing, it is unclear which options will be put forward by MPs or which options Mr Speaker will call for debate. The one thing that is clear is that Theresa May’s deal is dead following its third defeat by Parliament. It’s time for MPs to work to find a solution that will allow us to Brexit or, if this cannot happen, to acknowledge that it is now time for a general election to break the impasse.\nOutside of Brexit, I will be making a contribution at the Westminster Education Forum event on the Government’s Green Paper on Mental Health. I’ll be arguing that the Green Paper was a missed opportunity and fails a whole generation of young people. As a former teacher, I was particularly concerned about the way the proposals put more pressure on the teaching workforce without providing sufficient resources.\nLater in the day I will be meeting with Beccy Earnshaw and the team from the Oracy Network to discuss the recently launched inquiry into how Oracy is currently taught in schools and how improvements can be made to the quality of its teaching. As part of this, we’ll be asking for contributions from members of the public and experts to the inquiry and I will let you know how you’ll be able to contribute in due course. I’ll also be meeting with the Samaritans and attending a reception to celebrate 20 years of the minimum wage, one of Labour’s greatest achievements and a policy that has definitely changed the lives of millions of working people in this country for the better.\nTuesday\nOn Tuesday, I will be attending a meeting of the Education Select Committee in the morning. The topic for this session will be the Fourth Industrial Revolution and we will be taking evidence from a delegation from Taiwan.\nLater in the afternoon, I will be leading a Westminster Hall debate on youth inmates in solitary confinement. A report was recently published by the Children’s Commissioner which drew attention to the worrying rise in the number of young people who have been segregated in custody. The segregation of young offenders in secure settings receives significantly less attention than other issues within the youth justice estate. Restraint, for example, has been the subject of intense media scrutiny, independent reviews, and a thematic report from HMIP. I hope that raising this issue in Parliament will begin a conversation about the humane treatment of young offenders and allow us to build a better policy that will ultimately stop reoffending. Following this, I will be meeting the National Federation of Fishermen’s Organisations.\nWednesday\nOn Wednesday, there will be an accountability hearing of the Education Select Committee that will be attended by two Ministers- Anne Milton, the Minister for Apprenticeships and Skills and Nick Gibb, the Minister for School Standards.\nFollowing this I will be attending the APPG for the prevention of adverse childhood experiences. The focus on this session will be around preventing relationship breakdown and the negative effect that relationship breakdown can have on children. Preventing adverse childhood experiences is an issue that I am particularly passionate about and I will be co-hosting an event on the issue in Hull in the coming weeks.\nI will also be speaking in the Veterans Suicide Debate. Our veterans put themselves in harm’s way to protect our country and our way of life and it is right that we should honour them and support them when they leave the forces. I’m proud of the fact that Hull City Council has a Gold Award for the Ministry of Defence’s Employer Recognition Scheme (ERS) for employing veterans and former members of the armed services. I’m also proud that veterans organisations that we have in Hull and have often praised their work in the House of Commons but many of these organisations are run solely by volunteers. It is time for the government to step up and providing more assistance to prevent more veterans from contemplating suicide.\nThursday\nOn Thursday, I’ll be in London for Brexit questions before returning to Hull to meet with constituents and assist them with casework. I also expect to release a press release for the results of the survey I conducted of headteachers in Hull West and Hessle. Please keep an eye on my Facebook to find out more.\nFriday\nOn Friday, my meetings include Hull Training and Adult Education and The Deep.\nOther things to note\nI recently sent a letter to Simon Stevens, Head of NHS England calling for a day to be set aside to be ‘Bug Busting Day’. Headlice is a problem that is traditionally linked to schools. Last winter saw a big increase in the number of head lice outbreaks this winter with children from low-income families hardest and a UK study of 200 children found nearly half had been infested with head lice in the past five years – significantly more than the 2% to 8% estimated to have experienced nits in the past. Headlice treatment charities such as Community Hygiene Concern are linking this to the recent change in NHS guidance which recommended that treatment is not routinely prescribed. Repeatedly buying over the counter headlice treatments are expensive and we believe that unless the issue is addressed, it may lead to poorer children, who have parents who are unable to afford the treatments, being bullied or otherwise stigmatised. Headlice outbreaks can also be exceptionally disruptive to learning within schools and may harm the education of some children.\nIt used to be the case that schools were provided with free Bug Buster resources including a free bug busting wet combing kit, worksheets and lesson plans on how to treat headlice. The scheme proved to be particularly effective in Cheshire West where all schools were advised by the then Primary Care Trust (PCT) to take part in the Bug Buster control scheme. This scheme has, unfortunately, been discontinued because of government funding cuts.",

I believe the Government now needs to fully suspend mesh operations and to bring forward the NICE guidance which is still not expected until 2019! I also believe the Government should urgently review the financial consequences of dealing with failed mesh procedures and should consider introducing post-natal pelvic floor physiotherapy for all new mothers on the NHS. That is standard in France, and in light of the shocking new analysis which reveals the cost of botched mesh ops, our Government should bring forward a similar programme to both support the health and wellbeing of new mothers and to save NHS money in the longer term.”\nCommenting, Professor Heneghan said:\n‘These are the sorts of outpatient treatment numbers one would expect to see among a cohort of patients with multiple co-morbidities, not that you’d see among the relatively young and relatively cohort of women who have usually been operated on with surgical mesh for urinary incontinence.’\nGovernment agencies and Ministers have in the past claimed that the normal rate of serious complications, such as significant and long-running pain, sexual dysfunction or erosion and extrusion of mesh, only occurs in 1-3% of patients. However, these new statistics show that over the nine year period following surgery 4% of patients are at some point re-operated on to have their mesh removed fully or partially, while many thousands of other women are clearly suffering serious and ongoing side-effects, as evidenced by the significant and rising numbers of outpatient appointments.\nCommenting, Owen Smith MP, Chair of the APPG on Surgical Mesh said:\n‘These statistics show that the scale and complexity of the problems associated with mesh is far greater than has previously been accepted. It cannot be right that so many women are having to return repeatedly to hospital to deal with the side-effects caused by mesh, and it cannot be cost-effective for the NHS either. In light of these statistics, the Government has now called in Dame Sally Davies, the Chief Medical Officer, to investigate, in addition to the appointment of Baroness Julia Cumberledge just weeks ago to look at how the scandal has been handled. They now need to suspend the use of mesh until the results of these twin investigations are known.”\nThe APPG on Surgical Mesh is calling on the Government to: will this week call on the government to do more to support women injured by surgical mesh.\n- Suspend mesh implant operations until NICE brings forward new guidance on the safety and efficacy of Mesh for Stress Urinary Incontinence (currently scheduled for March 2019).\n- Offer Pelvic floor physiotherapy as standard on the NHS to new mums to help restore the core after birth and prevent these problems before they even start.\nSome estimates predict that between 10 and 20 per cent of people are injured by the procedure. Here are some other shocking statistics about the operation:\n- 4 in 5 women injured by surgical mesh suffer life changing pain.\n- 1 in 3 women injured by surgical mesh have had to give up work.\n- Only 3 in 20 women who received treatment with surgical mesh were warned of the risks.\nMesh surgery is a medical procedure used to treat incontinence and prolapse in women, many of whom are new mothers. The surgery, which usually takes less than half an hour, involves inserting a plastic mesh into the vagina to support the bladder, womb or bowel. It was sold to many women as a quick and easy fix to their problems. In some cases, the surgery has proved life changing. Many women have been to see their doctors but feel that they have not been listened to.",

The contact was made to ask Grayling to meet with Emma and Cllr Martin Mancey to discuss the proposed development consent order on Castle Street.\nEmma received a reply (attached) from Jesse Norman, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Department for Transport, stating that the Department did not wish to meet at this time. The Department for Transport has 5 Ministers.\nIn the point of order, Emma will say “This is a massive discourtesy and is a huge insult to my constituency and neighbouring constituencies who have seen repeated delays to the Castle Street development. I seek your advice Mr Speaker about how I can get the Secretary of State to meet with me on this incredibly important issue to the local economy.”\nReplying from the Chair, Speaker John Bercow stated that it was deeply unsatisfactory that the Department had taken two and a half months to reply to Emma on such an important issue and said that he hoped the Government would take note and organise a meeting in the near future.\nEmma further commented “The fact that the Conservative Transport Ministers took two and a half months to reply to me and are point blank refusing to meet shows a complete lack of urgency to do something about transport, not just in Hull West and Hessle but in the whole north of England. Not only will they not find time to meet with me over such an important issue, they won’t even give me the courtesy of a reply. This just compounds the lack of concern that they showed in their recent policy announcement to provide just £100 million to fix all the roads in the North.

I will then be attempting to ask a question in DWP questions about the use of HMRC real time information in calculating universal credit payments. The income will appear under the current date in Real Time Information regardless of when it was actually submitted. I’ve recently received reports that late submissions, some from up to 4 years ago, by employers have led to claimants losing out on money that they badly need now because of money they earned a long time ago.

Staff working insecure hours for the Hull based small business Grotto Hire UK, which operates Santa’s grottos, have still not been paid. Many are owed thousands of pounds. The company owner offered to put the company into liquidation so that staff could claim through the insolvency fund but his appointed liquidators have now pulled out leaving the company still running. I’ll be asking the Minister whether he will meet with me to discuss this director’s appalling betrayal of his staff and look at how the company can be wound up in the public interest. If I am not successful in being called by the Speaker then I will seek to raise a point of order with him afterwards on the issue.\nWednesday\nOn Wednesday, as well as attending and speaking in the SEND debate that I mentioned in the Tuesday entry above, I will be meeting separately with the\nImmigration Minister and a Minister from the Department for Work and Pensions to discuss individual constituent cases with them.\nThursday\nOn Thursday, I will return to the constituency. My meetings for the day will include the Hull Veterans Support Centre, Hull and East Yorkshire Mind, the Principal of Ron Dearing UTC and Hull York Medical School.\nFriday\nOn Friday, my meetings will include the Community Development Worker Refugee Council and Aspire Academy. I will spend the rest of the day in my constituency office meeting with constituents and working on assisting constituents with their casework requests.",

I’ve received notice that Hull City Council have received £3,038,293.68 of additional government funding and East Riding Council have received £2,061,832.61 of additional government funding.\nAs well as the usual use of this money to support those on low incomes with essentials over the winter month, I’ve had discussions with both councils to ensure that this year these funds are also being specifically allocated to as many pensioners as possible who are just above the Pension Credit threshold.\nBoth of our local authorities have made a decision on how they will allocate this government funding. Please see below the eligibility criteria for Hull City Council and East Riding of Yorkshire Council.

They also accept that the crossing has caused additional traffic issues for the city because of the increased popularity of the Humber Street development and the City of Culture events.\nHighways England reported that their officers had met with Hull City Council who would prefer to bring building a permanent bridge forward. This is because planning is already approved for a permanent bridge and extra time would be needed to secure planning for a temporary bridge and they would be able to use the £4 million promised by the LEP.\nBringing forward the building of the permanent bridge would have implications on the cost of the overall project and Highways England would need to ensure that building it early wouldn’t impact on the Castle Street project.\nIn mid-October Highways England will be making the case for some funds allocated to the Castle Street project to be released early to enable the permanent bridge as quickly as possible.\nEmma will be meeting again with Highways England after their mid-October meeting for an update on the bridge.\nEmma Hardy MP said,\n“During busy events the impact of the crossing on traffic, and the increased risk to pedestrian safety, concern me greatly. If we can’t have the Castle Street project brought forward then my priority is to secure the construction of a bridge, whether temporary or permanent, as soon as possible.\n“I will continue to press Highways England until this issue is resolved and there is a suitable resolution that will benefit the people of Hull West and Hessle.”",

We must act now to control the spread of the virus. The single most important action we can all take, in fighting coronavirus, is to stay at home, to protect the NHS and save lives.”\nHow long?\n“The new measures will apply nationally for four weeks up to Wednesday 2 December. At the end of the period, we will look to return to a regional approach, based on the latest data.”\nNew restrictions:\n- Stay at Home: you must not leave or be outside your home unless for specific purposes. These include:\n- or childcare or education, where this is not provided online\n- for work purposes, where your place of work remains open and where you cannot work from home (including if your job involves working in other people’s homes)\n- to exercise outdoors or visit an outdoor public place – with the people you live with, with your support bubble or, when on your own, with 1 person from another household (children under school age, as well as those dependent on round-the-clock care, such as those with severe disabilities, who are with their parents will not count towards the limit on two people meeting outside).\n- for any medical concerns, reasons, appointments and emergencies, or to avoid or escape risk of injury or harm – such as domestic abuse\n- shopping for basic necessities, for example food and medicine, which should be as infrequent as possible\n- to visit members of your support bubble or provide care for vulnerable people, or as a volunteer\nWhat is a support bubble? (https://www.gov.uk/guidance/making-a-support-bubble-with-another-household):\n“A support bubble is a close support network between a household with only one adult in the home (known as a single-adult household) and one other household of any size.\nThis is called making a ‘support bubble’.\nOnce you’re in a support bubble, you can think of yourself as being in a single household with people from the other household. It means you can have close contact with that household as if they were members of your own household.”\n- Social distancing:\nRemember – ‘Hands. Face. Space’:\n- hands – wash your hands regularly and for 20 seconds\n- face – wear a face covering in indoor settings where social distancing may be difficult, and where you will come into contact with people you do not normally meet\n- space – stay 2 metres apart from people you do not live with where possible, or 1 metre with extra precautions in place (such as wearing face coverings or increasing ventilation indoors)\n- Meeting with family or friends:\nYou must not meet socially indoors with family or friends unless they are part of your household – meaning the people you live with – or support bubble\nYou can exercise or visit outdoor public places with the people you live with, your support bubble, or 1 person from another household (children under school age, as well as those dependent on round-the-clock care, such as those with severe disabilities, who are with their parents will not count towards the limit on two people meeting outside).\nOutdoor public places include:\n- parks, beaches, countryside,\n- public gardens (whether or not you pay to enter them), allotments\n- playgrounds\nYou cannot meet in a private garden.\n- Businesses and venues\nBusinesses that must close:\n- all non-essential retail, including, but not limited to clothing and electronics stores, vehicle showrooms, travel agents, betting shops, auction houses, tailors, car washes, tobacco and vape shops.\n- indoor and outdoor leisure facilities such as bowling alleys, leisure centres and gyms, sports facilities including swimming pools, golf courses and driving ranges, dance studios, stables and riding centres, soft play facilities, climbing walls and climbing centres, archery and shooting ranges, water and theme parks,\n- entertainment venues such as theatres, concert halls, cinemas, museums and galleries, casinos, adult gaming centres and arcades, bingo halls, bowling alleys, concert halls, zoos and other animal attractions, botanical gardens;\n- personal care facilities such as hair, beauty and nail salons, tattoo parlours, spas, massage parlours, body and skin piercing services, non-medical acupuncture, and tanning salons\nA full list of business closures will be published soon.\nSupport groups can stay open: support groups that are essential to deliver in person can continue with up to 15 participants where formally organised to provide mutual aid, therapy or any other form of support. This includes support to victims of crime, people in drug and alcohol recovery, new parents and guardians, people with long-term illnesses, people facing issues relating to their sexuality or gender, and those who have suffered bereavement.\nA number of public services will also stay open and you will be able to leave home to visit them. These include:\n- the NHS and medical services like GPs. We are supporting the NHS to safely carry out urgent and non-urgent services and it is vital anyone who thinks they need any kind of medical care comes forward and seeks help.\n- Jobcentre Plus sites\n- Courts\n- Civil Registrations Offices\n- Weddings, civil partnerships, religious services, and funerals\nFunerals:\n- Funerals can be attended by a maximum of 30 people, and it is advised that only close friends and family attend.\n- Linked ceremonial events such as stone settings and ash scatterings can also continue with up to 15 people in attendance.\n- Anyone working is not included.\n- Social distancing should be maintained between people who do not live together or share a support bubble.\nWeddings and civil partnerships:\n- Weddings, civil partnership ceremonies will not be permitted to take place except in exceptional circumstances.\nPlaces of Worship will be closed, unless they are being used for:\n- Funerals\n- To broadcast acts of worship\n- Individual prayer\n- Formal childcare or where part of a school\n- Essential voluntary and public services, such as blood donation or food banks\n- Other exempted activities such as some support groups\n- Going to work:\nTo help contain the virus, everyone who can work effectively from home must do so.\nWhere people cannot do so (for instance people who work in critical national infrastructure, construction or manufacturing) they should continue to travel to work/attend their workplace. This is essential to keeping the country operating and supporting vital sectors and employers.\n“Public sector employees working in essential services, including education settings, should continue to go into work. The risk of transmission can be substantially reduced if COVID-secure guidelines (https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19)are followed closely. Extra consideration should be given to those people at higher risk.”\n- Going to school, college, and university\n- Senior clinicians still advise that school is the best place for children to be, and so they should continue to go to school\n- The Prime Minister and Education Secretary have been clear that exams will go ahead next summer, as they are the fairest and most accurate way to measure a pupil’s attainment.\n- We therefore need to keep schools and colleges open so that children are able to keep progressing towards exams and the next stage of education or employment.\nUniversity:\n- If you live at university, you must not move back and forward between your permanent home and student home during term time. You should only return home at the end of term for Christmas. We will publish further guidance on the end of term.\n- Childcare\n- Parents will still be able to access some registered childcare and other childcare activities (including wraparound care) where reasonably necessary to enable parents to work, or for the purposes of respite care.\n- Early years settings can remain open. Parents are able to form a childcare bubble with another household for the purposes of informal childcare, where the child is 13 or under\n- Protecting the vulnerable\nIf you are over 60 or clinically vulnerable, you could be at higher risk of severe illness from coronavirus. You:\n- should be especially careful to follow the rules and minimise your contacts with others\n- should continue to wash your hands carefully and more frequently than usual and maintain thorough cleaning of frequently touched areas in your home and/or workspace\nMore info on clinically extremely vulnerable: (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19)\nOver this period, we are advising the CEV to work from home.\nIf you cannot work from home, you are advised not to go to work and may be eligible for Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) or Employment Support Allowance (ESA).\nYou are encouraged to stay at home as much as possible but are encouraged to go outside for exercise.\nThe Government will write to everybody who is clinically extremely vulnerable to set out detailed advice while the new restrictions are in place\n- Visiting in Care Homes\nGuidance to be published before Thursday.\n- Travel\nForeign travel advice: https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-advice-novel-coronavirus?priority-taxon=774cee22-d896-44c1-a611-e3109cce8eae\nYou should avoid travelling in or out of your local area, and you should look to reduce the number of journeys you make. However, you can and should still travel for a number of reasons, including:\n- travelling to work where this cannot be done from home\n- travelling to education and for caring responsibilities\n- hospital GP and other medical appointments or visits where you have had an accident or are concerned about your health\n- visiting venues that are open, including essential retail\n- exercise, if you need to make a short journey to do so\nIf you need to travel we encourage you to walk or cycle where possible, and to plan ahead and avoid busy times and routes on public transport. This will allow you to practise social distancing while you travel.\nOvernight stays and holidays away from primary residences will not be allowed. This includes holidays abroad and in the UK. It also means you cannot stay in a second home, if you own one, or staying with anyone you do not live with or are in a support bubble with.\nList of helpful website:\nCovid case numbers slides from 31 October press conference: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/slides-to-accompany-coronavirus-press-conference-31-october-2020\nFinancial Support: (https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus/worker-support?priority-taxon=774cee22-d896-44c1-a611-e3109cce8eae)\nCoronavirus Job Retention Scheme: https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-what-to-do-if-youre-employed-and-cannot-work\nFurlough has been extended until December 2020.\nBusiness support: https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus/business-support?priority-taxon=774cee22-d896-44c1-a611-e3109cce8eae\nBenefit calculators: https://www.gov.uk/benefits-calculators\nSelf-employed: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/self-employment-income-support-scheme-grant-extension\nCovid Testing and Track and Trace:\nSelf-Isolating: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance?priority-taxon=774cee22-d896-44c1-a611-e3109cce8eae\nNHS Track and Trace: https://www.gov.uk/guidance/nhs-test-and-trace-how-it-works?priority-taxon=774cee22-d896-44c1-a611-e3109cce8eae",

There is also nothing in this scheme to help with retraining and upskilling those who have lost their jobs due to this crisis either.\nI will do everything I can to protect jobs and businesses in Hull West and Hessle, and I welcome any scheme that keeps people in work and allows businesses to survive, but as this government has shown time and time again with its promises the devil is in the detail. ”",

All of them bringing their concerns to me and telling me what is important to them.\nThe latest event we did was the Strong Women event with guest speaker Dr Kirsty Clode, the Chair of Women into Manufacturing and Engineering (WiME). It was such good event attended by some wonderfully inspiring and strong women.\nI am so proud of the great women we have in Hull and they continue the tradition of great women in Hull we have always had; from their fishing heritage when the men were at sea, it was the women that were the backbone of this great industry, and the women left at home during the World War II, raising families and maintain industry all whilst suffering under the blitz.\nWe have such a proud tradition of Strong Women in Hull and we have a bright future with this tradition set to continue.\nThe main reason I have done the Big Conversation for the third year is because it gives me the ability to meet you all more often and to listen to your concerns on a far larger scale. Let’s be honest, my job is to represent you and I can only do that effectively if I know what is important to you. These events let me get to know you better and get to know what it is that is important to you and your families.\nSo thank you all so much for coming along to the events I have had so far and I look forward to seeing more of you over the next week, so look out for the posters, tweets & Facebook posts.

  "https_www_emmahardy_org_uk_/https_www_emmahardy_org_uk_2023_10_13_statement-on-telegraph-poles/content_101.html": "Many constituents have contacted me raising concerns as a result of new telecommunication companies installing infrastructure in their local area, with minimal prior notification and no consultation with residents. Such works appear to have accelerated in recent months, with many areas in Hull West and Hessle subject to them. The use of telegraph poles has also become commonplace, resulting in streets with numerous telegraph poles installed by different providers or areas that have previously only had underground infrastructure seeing the installation of telegraph poles. Even when the use of telegraph poles is avoided and works to install new infrastructure is underground, many residents have seen their streets dug up 2-3 times with unsightly “trench scars” and markings left on the pavement.\nI found out that this is because telecoms network operators are ‘statutory undertakers’ for the purpose of the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991 (‘the NRSWA’). This means that, like utilities companies, they have a general right to install infrastructure on or under public roads and to carry out associated street works. The NRSWA requires that undertakers notify the relevant highway authority, such as Hull City Council or East Riding of Yorkshire Council of planned works on public roads, but they do not need its consent.\nConcerning telegraph poles, I now understand that telegraph poles do not need planning permission under the Electronic Communications Code (Conditions and Restrictions) 2003 and The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 and the only requirement on the operator is 28 days’ notice to the Local Planning Authority (LPA) who can only make suggestions on siting which the telecoms company is under no obligation to follow. There is no requirement to inform residents of the work prior to installation.\nI have been advised that when the new legislation/planning rules concerning telecoms infrastructure was introduced, it was made deliberately broad to ensure that broadband infrastructure could be installed quickly to enable rural areas, without existing infrastructure to reap the benefits of new and/or improved access to broadband without delay. It seems to be an unfortunate consequence of this deliberately broad legislation that the city of Hull and Hessle is seeing an increased number of providers installing their infrastructure with a view to offering an alternative to KCOM\nI want you to know that I share all of your concerns.\nInitially, I did some research to find out how it is possible for works of these type to take place without the need to conduct a consultation or obtain permission from local authority planning departments and/or residents.\nIt was Conservative/Liberal Democrat Coalition government policy to remove ‘red tape’ associated with installing communications infrastructure in a bid to facilitate high-speed broadband across the country.\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/news/fastest-broadband-in-europe-delivering-infrastructure-to-boost-uk-businesses–2\nIn relation to this, the government has recently said that “most telecoms infrastructure, including telegraph poles, masts and base stations, is subject to nationally set permitted development rights. Permitted development rights enable certain types of development to be undertaken without the need for planning permission, where the need to apply for permission would be out of proportion with the impacts of development. The prior approval of the local planning authority is still required for the installation of some telecoms infrastructure, such as new masts”\nI believe that this indicates that there no plans to amend the legislation to exclude underground cabling and/or telegraph poles from permitted development rights but please be assured that I will continue to press the government on this matter.\nIn the meantime, I have undertaken a number of actions to try and prevent my constituency being blighted by the constant works taking place to install underground and overhead infrastructure.\nI have met with new telecoms providers and asked them to cease works in Hessle, or to at least consider using underground cabling instead of telegraph poles but was advised that it was their intention to continue with their business plans unamended despite outcry from residents.\nI have liaised with both Hull City Council and East Riding of Yorkshire Council. I understand that they are deluged with complaints from local residents but, again as the current legislation provides for telecommunications being able to install infrastructure without any permission, they are also powerless to stop the works from taking place.\nI have since met with Ofcom, which is the communications regulator in the UK, to raise concerns raise my concerns about the current position in relation to the deployment of telegraph poles in Hull West and Hessle and the lack of resource sharing between providers meaning that infrastructure can be installed by multiple different providers in the same area.\nWe discussed the alleged lack of infrastructure sharing by KCOM, I was informed that Ofcom need a formal complaint from one of the new companies to investigate obstacles preventing the economically viable sharing of KCOM’s existing poles and ducting. I understand that they have no powers to issue instructions to new providers over sharing infrastructure as they are not existing monopolies.\nIn the first instance, Ofcom confirmed that they are looking to arrange a meeting with all service providers, such as KCOM, MS3, Grain and Connexin, to see if a joint resolution can be sought. I requested a further meeting with Ofcom in a month’s time for an update on their progress, which they agreed to.\nRegretfully, at this time, it seems the telecommunication companies are acting within current legislation. Even where they may have neglected the Code of Practice, that does not ultimately prevent them from undertaking the work.\nUnfortunately this issue isn’t a simple fix and requires a change in the law by the government to ensure that approval must be sought by telecommunications providers before commencing these works. I will of course continue to lobby the government to compel them to change their stance on this matter.\nI have been made aware that the telecommunication companies in working in Hull West and Hessle, will consider resident’s legitimate concerns about the citing of a telegraph pole, such as when it would cause an access issue or when an application for a dropped kerb has been submitted but the works have not yet taken place. If you have this type of concern, I would suggest that you contact the company directly or my office on emma.hardy.mp@parliament.uk and I will be happy to raise the concerns on your behalf.",

However, in 2016, Public Health England (PHE) reported on oral health in older people in England and Wales using data from existing surveys.’\nThe report found that: older adults living in care homes were more likely to have no natural teeth and less likely to have a functional dentition; older adults living in care homes were more likely to have higher levels of tooth decay; care home managers experienced greater difficulty in accessing dental care for residents than household resident older adults did and residents resisting oral care routines was the second most common oral health issue raised by care home managers. Further information can be found here\nCommenting after the question, Emma said ‘While we rightly talk about promoting good oral health among parents for children who are not yet old enough to completely look after themselves, those at the other end of the age spectrum who can’t look after themselves are just as deserving of our support. It’s a disgrace that older and vulnerable adults living in care homes are shamefully not receiving the level of dental care they need. Although the Department of Health and Social Care knew that older people living in care homes were more likely to have higher levels of tooth decay and less likely to have any natural teeth, no action has been taken. Something must be done to change this and, over the coming weeks and months, I will be pushing the government to make this happen.’",

And while local authorities are under pressure to clean up toxic air, The Government are not funding the transport developments needed in this region to improve this.\nIn terms of roads, the £100m offered by the Transport Secretary for roads in the North of England is an insult and Emma will be fighting for more money. Furthermore, Emma will continue to push for confirmation that the Castle Street development in Hull will not be delayed further.\nEmma said:\n“The rejection of electrification for railways in my constituency of Hull West and Hessle and the continued delay after delay to our road development is limiting our future economic development and the improvement to the air quality residents need.\n“This Government claims to believe in equality of opportunity, but actions speak louder than words. We face not having the spare transport capacity to accommodate growth, rail journey times are slower and the rail network is becoming increasingly congested. The lack of investment for the North is hindering our development.\n“During the debate I asked the Minister to offer the people of Hull West and Hessle the reassurances we need on this vital development and I will continue to push the Government to invest properly in our railways.”",

The major business in the House of Commons Chamber will be the continuation of the debate on the Withdrawal Agreement ahead of the vote on Tuesday.\nTuesday\nOn Tuesday, the main order of business is the vote on the EU Withdrawal Agreement. The deal is not good for the country and I will be voting against it. My reasons for doing this are to do with my concerns that this deal leaves the door open for the strong protections for our natural environment, local heritage and rights at work that the EU currently provides to be eroded in the future. I envision releasing a statement closer to the time setting these reasons out in further detail. The delay in the vote will have changed very few minds and it still looks exceptionally likely that the government will be defeated.\nAway from Brexit, on Tuesday I will also be participating in a debate on local government funding. This is a topic that I have continually campaigned on since being elected to Parliament and it remains the fact that Hull needs more money having lost one pound in every three since 2010.\nWednesday\nOn Wednesday, the Education Select Committee will be holding an accountability session with the Secretary of State, Damian Hinds. I will be asking him about the increase in the use of isolation rooms along with the timing of policy diktats from the Department of Education. I will also be contributing to a debate on bioethanol. You will be familiar with the ongoing scenario with Vivergo Fuels. I will be arguing that the government’s failure to bring forward the renewable transport fuel obligation was the largest contributing factor to Vivergo having to close production.\nThursday\nOn Thursday, I will be working in my constituency office, answering constituent’s correspondence. I will also be meeting with representatives from Hull City Council to discuss off-rolling in schools. The number of school children who have been home schooled has doubled over the last three years. While this may be appropriate for some children, the fact that it has doubled over the last three years is worrying and we will be discussing what can be done to arrest this alarming trend.\nFriday\nOn Friday, I will be holding meetings with the Humber Bridge Board and Humber Rescue’s Paul Berriff OBE to discuss safety on the Humber Bridge following the tragic suicides that took place on the 29th December. There are wider mental health issues that need to be addressed and support given to people who may be contemplating suicide, it is important that we also do everything we can to make it as hard as possible to use the bridge for these ends.

A no deal Brexit is not just about if you want to go on world trade organisation rules. A no deal Brexit means a no deal for everything.\nA minority of people are asking me to support a no deal. Having a no deal means no arrangements on security, aviation, consumer protection, animal welfare, medicines, transport and no arrangements for Northern Ireland amongst many other things.\nEveryday our police and security services use and share intelligence with Europe. A no-deal Brexit means that overnight our security and police services will not have access to this information. This information has been crucial in the past to convict child sex traffickers working across Europe.\nA no deal Brexit will impact health providers . This includes inability to access medicines and a shortage of health professionals. There is a very deep and significant concern about access to supplies which have a short shelf life such as radioisotopes used in cancer care.\nA no deal Brexit would mean that farmers and food producers could face a delay of 6 months before they are certified as approved exporters to EU counties. That’s 6 months without an income and many businesses will not survive.\nThere are many other examples. A no deal Brexit is so much more than just a matter about trade.\nLabour’s 2017 manifesto recognised that, “leaving the EU with ‘no deal’ is the worst possible deal for Britain and that it would do damage to our economy and trade. We will reject ‘no deal’ as a viable option.”\nI promised to fight for the best Brexit deal for Hull West and Hessle and I have consistently and repeatedly supported amendments to try and improve Theresa May’s deal.

The response has been overwhelming, and it’s a real testament to the incredible small businesses that make our community so vibrant and strong. These businesses are the backbone of our local economy, and I am proud to support them.”\nShe continued: “This Christmas, I’m encouraging everyone to shop locally and support the small businesses that are at the heart of our local community. Every purchase, big or small, helps strengthen the local economy and keeps our community thriving.”\nThe winners were nominated and voted for completely by the local community with thousands of residents participating. Emma also extended her thanks to all the businesses the nominated businesses for their commitment to providing exceptional services and products to their customers.\nAs we head into the festive season, Emma is urging constituents to continue supporting small businesses by shopping locally, whether it’s finding the perfect gift, enjoying a meal at a local restaurant, or investing in services that benefit our community.",

At a recent meeting with FCC, UNISON argued that given the nature of the job, using heavy equipment to deal with contaminated waste in all weather conditions, a sick pay scheme is a ‘safety net’ for when people fall ill.\nUnfortunately the attitude of FCC Managers; who receive sick pay; was that their blue collar employees “should find their own safety net”.\nIn the past workers suffering cancer were unable to receive sick pay and while receiving chemo and radiotherapy have had to attend work or lose pay.\nManagers and supervisors with the same or similar illnesses would have been able to take time off on sick pay to recover.\nWorkers have previously stated that they would be prepared to forego their annual bonuses and other payments to ensure that the company is able to pay for sick pay for them.\nFCC workers in Spain have also gone out on strike and lobbied the company’s head office in solidarity with workers in the UK.\nUNISON are looking into whether this is a breach of the Equalities Act (2010) which covers discrimination in relation to ‘Protected Characteristics’, and which specifically mentions illnesses such as cancer as a recognised disability from the point of diagnosis.\nCommenting, Emma said “It’s disgusting that FCC Environment has decided that they will only pay sick pay to their managers and not all employees. Sick pay is a basic right for employees and a basic duty for employers to pay- it is not something that you can pick and choose, it is part of the cost of employing somebody. It’s not good enough for a firm that is receiving public money in the form of government contracts to be subsidised by the government because it can’t be bothered to pay sick pay and would rather put that money towards profits for shareholders. I’m fully on the side of the workers in this dispute and have been down to the picket line twice already, they are doing everything they possibly can to come to a consensus with FCC and have even suggested they will give up their annual bonuses to secure this sick pay. It’s time for FCC to be reasonable and pay up and I’ll be doing everything I possibly can to make sure this happens.”",

The council made a decision today that will have a really positive impact on the future lives of hundreds of children.\n“That being said, the Council should never have been put in the position where it has to choose between which services to keep and which to cut. Government funding cuts imposed by this Conservative Government- and previous Conservative and Lib Dem Governments- have meant that Hull City Council has lost nearly a third of its spending power since 2010. Today, I will be speaking in Parliament to ask the Chancellor to reverse his decision to reduce the ‘Banker’s Levy’ tax and instead give more money to fund Children’s Services in Hull.”",
  "https_www_emmahardy_org_uk_/https_www_emmahardy_org_uk_2017_12_05_legal-aid-cuts-cost-taxpayer-more-in-long-run/content_174.html": "Speaking in a Parliamentary Question today Emma Hardy, the MP for Hull West and Hessle, called the government’s legal aid cuts a false economy.\nAccess to justice has been seriously undermined by the Conservative government with hundreds of thousands of people unable to enforce their rights owing to cuts to legal aid. When people lack the money or the knowledge to enforce their rights, those rights are worth nothing more than the paper they are written on.\nThe introduction of the Legal Aid Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act (Laspo) in 2012 left many vulnerable people unable to access justice or forced to defend themselves in areas as fundamental as housing, employment, immigration and welfare benefits.\nA Citizens Advice study (2010) estimated that for every £1 of legal aid expenditure on housing advice, the state potentially saves £2.34; for every £1 of legal aid expenditure on debt advice, the state potentially saves £2.98; for every £1 of legal aid expenditure on employment advice, the state potentially saves £7.13.\nA lack of early legal advice can create unnecessary costs for the taxpayer due to cases going to court which could have been resolved earlier. Worsening legal problems can also create other knock-on costs for the public purse, potentially causing issues such as poor health, homelessness and debt.\nLast week the Law Society called on the government to guarantee reintroducing early legal advice for housing and family cases in its review. The President of the Supreme Court, Baroness Hale, also recently called the legal aid reforms ‘A False Economy’.\nEmma Said “Recently I visited my local Chamber of Commerce where a solicitor told me that cuts in legal aid have led to more people representing themselves in court, extending court proceedings and costing courts more money. In other words the government’s legal aid reforms are a false economy and just one more example of how the Government’s spending cuts are just so short sighted. Restoring early legal advice would not only help to resolve many legal problems but would also save taxpayers’ money and constituents should rest assured that I will continue to press the government on the issue.”",

It is their day to day: they are in it. Sometimes, though, when you are ‘in’ something or close to it, thinking about it in radically new ways is tricky. In Hull, our education provocation came from Lucy Hollis, education manager at GROW, a charity that works in schools and communities to promote mental well-being, physical health and a more hands-on relationship with the natural world.\nFrom the get go, the discussion around education went beyond existing structures to a wider questioning of the values that drive our current education system. Lucy stated that ‘an estimated one in three students in every classroom have a diagnosable mental health problem’. A recent YouGov poll commissioned by the Wildlife Trust highlighted a gradual loss of contact and connection with nature during childhood. Shockingly, 1 in 5 children do not know eggs come from animals. GROW’s work is grounded in the idea that these outcomes are related. They have created a programme that unites food education and mental and physical health, with the goal ‘To connect; to ourselves, each other, and the world around us’.\nTo facilitate the break-out groups and get to grips with what sixth formers see as the challenges for education, Lucy was joined by school leader Steve Hoey and The Beats Bus Crew, an initiative that uses hip-hop to get young people to speak out about their hopes for the future. The group produced ‘The Unspoken’, a rap underpinned by the sense that many of the problems in our current system are not voiced. Without acknowledging these issues, how can we tackle them? At its core, the rap questions what school ‘success’ looks like and who it is serving. It calls out the curriculum’s failure to address racism and the UK’s colonial history and emphasises that boxing young people in undermines their self-worth and fosters a narrow understanding of what ‘intelligence’ looks like. The rap ends: ‘Education should be a great equaliser, not a personality analyser.’ The inclusive nature of their presentation saw Emma Hardy MP and Bishop Alison White join with the rest of the audience in accompanying the young people.\nTheir lyrics hit hard, going to the core concern of a ‘sausage machine’ education system with a narrow and restrictive curriculum. Without challenge, this system disconnects initiatives such as Lucy’s, the Beats Bus and a new social enterprise founded by Steve Hoey called Inclusion Bridge. This works to reconnect young people with an education that suits their need to flourish and grow not just their intellect but their wider learning and way of being in the world.\nSince the outbreak of coronavirus, the markers of academic success have been hit hard. The certainty of exams and a clear path to the next stage are no longer a given. More worryingly, the critical role schools play outside the academic has come starkly into view. Without free school meals, the support of staff, and access to technology, the most disadvantaged students have been worst hit. Many schools have been striving to maintain their role as ‘equalisers’, providing opportunities for all and support far beyond the academic, but the education system cannot achieve this alone. In a post-covid environment, tackling the educational gap it will have opened up further will be a key challenge. The mental health impacts of a loss of support, access to friendships, purpose and a route through adolescence could be devastating.\nStill, positive news, progress and initiatives in the wake of coronavirus can be found. Emma Hardy is running a project to get old laptops to young people through TimeBank in Hull as a way to counter digital exclusion. The work of the Beats Bus in Hull is growing. Supported by the Paul Hamlyn Foundation and many Hull partners, the Beats Bus team have launched the 2021 ‘Hip Hop School of Excellence’, an alternative schooling provision that acknowledges and celebrates the legitimacy of different ways of educating and supporting young people to think and speak with confidence and skill.\nIn Hull and beyond, we see positive moves towards a more inclusive education system, and initiatives to counter educational inequality. A greater provision of these kinds of initiatives, coupled with a commitment to listen to students talking about their experience of this time, and what they need to get back on track, may be vital for building back better.\nAlex Talbott is Programme Manager for The Orwell Youth Prize",

  "https_www_emmahardy_org_uk_/https_www_emmahardy_org_uk_2020_11_06_notes-from-westminster/content_157.html": "Chapter 8\nFollowing the return to parliament this week I have wanted to get back writing my ‘Notes from Westminster’ to give greater insight into my role and an understanding of what has been happening in Westminster this week.\nThe impact of the COVID pandemic is visible everywhere on the parliamentary estate. There are no visitors, no lobbyists, no members of the public watching the debates and the building itself is quite empty. Social distancing remains in the debating chamber and Doorkeepers rush up to disinfect the despatch box after each debate. Unlike the House of Lords, Members of Parliament are not allowed to take part in debate remotely so I will still be travelling to and from London to be able to raise your concerns.\nThe happening of the previous few weeks in parliament has been quite the collection; from the government deciding to vote against providing meals for hungry children during the half term, the leaked decision to introduce a national lockdown on Saturday resulting in chaos, confusion and an urgent statement from the Prime Minister, version four of the Chancellor’s winter economic plan and the PMs refusal to agree that all votes must be counted in the USA election before any one declares themselves the winner of the presidential election.\nDuring October alone I have managed to speak in parliament and address the government over ten times on such a diverse range of topics such as rights for family members to visit loved ones in care homes, COVID-19 business support, Rugby league, support for the coach industry, greater protection for emergency service workers and support for pubs and hospitality amongst other issues. I get asked about how I decide which issues to raise and it is all based on the messages, conversations, letters and emails I have from people living in Hull West and Hessle.\nMy involvement in the campaign to support women with endometriosis came from meeting a local constituent called Kate and since then I have become Vice Chair of the APPG for Endometriosis. A few weeks ago, we released our report of recommendations to the government and these included targets for shorter diagnosis time and highlighted the need for more research into the condition. This is just the beginning though and the entire APPG will not stop pushing this in parliament until we get the actions that so many women deserve.\nOther actions and votes in October included the Lord Alfred Dubs Amendment to the Immigration Bill where the government voted against amendments that would allow separated child refugees to reunite with families in the UK. Lord Dubs was himself a child refugee who fled the Nazi’s. The governments rejection of these amendments means that unaccompanied child refugees will be left at risk of exploitation in unsafe areas, in awful conditions, and it will see the UK refuse them safety and sanctuary in our country.\nOn Monday 2nd November 2020, the Prime Minister made a statement in the House of Commons announcing a second national lockdown in England.\nThree weeks ago I joined with my colleagues in calling on the Government to implement a short circuit-break in England, in line with the recommendations of the Government’s scientific advisors.\nI did not come into Parliament to restrict people’s freedoms, to prevent people meeting their friends and their loved ones, or to decide when people can and cannot leave their home or how many people may attend a funeral. I do not want Parliament to be closing businesses, gyms, bars or places of worship. Indeed, I do not want Parliament to be legislating on any of these issues, least of all after the British public have made so many enormous sacrifices already.\nWhile these new restrictions are not in any way desirable or perfect, I do not believe there is any excuse for inaction or for allowing the virus to continue to spread. It is with a heavy heart, and in the national interest, that I support them.\nPeople in our constituency and across the country will want to know that there is a plan for exiting restrictions. Ministers have so far not set out what criteria will be used to judge whether the lockdown should be lifted, and I hope that they will clarify this as a matter of urgency.\nOn Tuesday 3rd November 2020 MPs debated and voted on the Overseas Operations (Service Personnel and Veterans) Bill. The stated purpose of the Bill is to provide greater legal protections to Armed Forces personnel and veterans serving on military operations overseas.\nI voted for a New Clause which would have amended the Bill so that claims by troops or former service personnel were not blocked in all circumstances, as they are under the Bill at present. It is simply wrong for those who put their life on the line serving Britain overseas to have less access to compensation and justice than the UK civilians whom they defend—or indeed than their comrades whose service is largely UK-based.\nI was disappointed that the Government opposed and defeated these amendments.\nOn Wednesday 4th November 2020, the House of Commons considered the Agriculture Bill, which establishes a new farming system following the UK leaving the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy.\nI am once again pressing the Government to adopt a legal guarantee that British animal welfare and environmental standards will not be undercut in post-Brexit trade deals. I voted in support of successful amendments from the House of Lords, which would enshrine in law the Government’s manifesto commitment to not undermine UK food standards in trade deals and would make it accountable to Parliament during this process.\nHowever, these amendments were voted down by the government by 331 to 272, farmers have a genuine and widespread concern about the lack of a legal guarantee, which is still missing.\nI shall report back next month with another chapter of Notes from Westminster, so stay safe, work together and hopefully we can all get through this awful time together.\nEmma",

The appeal, which is asking for people to donate food items and parcels for each day of advent, but in reverse, runs up to the 17th December.\nThe Reverse Avent Calendar works differently to a traditional one by using the days in late November/December to put 24 items into a box daily ready to take to a local foodbank in time for Christmas week.\nMs Hardy is working alongside Beanie Street Foodbank, Hessle and Anlaby Foodbank and Hull Foodbank, and with local groups Skint Dad and the Hull Food Poverty Alliance in ensuring the widest audience is contacted and the most donations are made available in what is forecast to be a very difficult winter for many working families across the region.\nEmma Hardy MP said:\n“Food poverty continues to be huge problem across the country and especially in my constituency of Hull West and Hessle. For this reason, I am encouraging businesses, schools and families to put together a Reverse Advent Calendar food box to take to one of three foodbanks in my area.”\n“With the current cost-of-living crisis, rising heating bills, rising cost of food and fuel for cars, I know everyone’s budgets are at breaking point, that is why I am hoping this appeal will be able to help out those who are struggling the most in my constituency and hopefully spread a little bit of Christmas joy.”\nNaomi Willis from Skintdad.co.uk added:\n“Talking with our readers, we can see every day just how much of a need there is for food banks. We all need to do what we can to fight against food poverty. So many people have lost their income in the last year alone and demand will be higher than usual, but anyone can help their wider community in a very selfless way by getting involved.\nIf you would like to be a part of this then please can all advent calendar boxes be dropped off at one of the below foodbanks by 17th December.",

This news comes as it is revealed that P&O’s parent company DP World spent £147 million sponsoring the 2022 European Golf Tour.\nP&O Ferries also applied for covid support from the Government and cut 1000 jobs.\nEmma Hardy MP said in reaction to the news:\n“Hull has a proud fishing heritage and I know that many in Hull West and Hessle remain employed in the shipping industry.\nI believe that it is absolutely appalling that DP World seems to have spent money owed to hard-working employees on sponsoring a golf tournament.\nIt is simply not good enough that the Government has allowed DP World to break pension promises. The Government must urgently review this situation.”\nYou can view Emma’s full statement here: https://fb.watch/aOpy4_M11B/",

The reorganisation of the NHS after this Act was the biggest reorganisation to occur in the health service since the introduction of the NHS in 1948.\nIn a letter from the Exchequer Secretary at the Treasury, Robert Jenrick MP, Emma was informed that the next steps would be for the Humber NHS Trust to submit its business case, something it has done twice already.\nFollowing meetings with the Trust, Emma was told by officials in Humber NHS Trust that Sustainability and Transformation Plan processes confuse funding application procedures.\nCommenting after the speech, Emma said “Hull desperately needs a new Children and Adolescent Mental Health Services unit and I was delighted when the announcement of the funding was made in August. So you can understand the anger that I feel that the Government seems to be no further towards releasing the money.\nThe people of Hull are sick of bureaucratic barriers being thrown up to prevent us from getting the CAMHS unit we so desperately need. We’re even more annoyed when the government claim that more money has been put into the NHS when the same money has been announced twice already and, looking at the letter I received from the Exchequer Secretary, will no doubt be announced a third time before we eventually do get it.\nThe bureaucratic, complicated, fragmented system put in place by the Health and Social Care Act does no good for anybody. It does not properly achieve rapid action on local needs. It needs to be rethought, reinvented and reconfigured.\nTimeline\nA full timeline of the Trust’s application process is as follows:\n- Original Loan application was submitted in July 2017 (13th July).\n- Further information was requested in August, which was sent (22nd August).\n- This was followed up by a visit to the Trust by the Loans Committee (6th September).\n- The Trust sent amended docs and the committee approved the initial loan application for £6.5m in September (20th September).\n- They subsequently applied for an increased loan of £7.5m in December which was approved by the committee (19th December).\n- The Trust have been in regular dialogue with Nick Rose at the Department for Health and Social to try and drawdown the capital, however the national constrain on CDEL and prevented this.\n- The Trust also submitted a Sustainability and Transformation Plan Capital Bid for Wave I in April 2017 but was unsuccessful with its application, as no bids were approved for the Humber Coast and Vale Sustainability and Transformation Plan.\n- The Trust resubmitted a STP Bid following consultation with NHS Improvement in January 2018 and it received notification that it had been successful in March 2018.\n- The Trust has submitted a refreshed business case, STP Estates Strategy and Value for Money template to NHS Improvement, this was approved by the Regional NHS Improvement Finance Committee on Friday and is now due to be sent to the Department.\n- The money has been announced for this project on at least two occasions. August and March.\nEmma’s campaign for answers\n- Emma asked a question to the Chancellor on the 17th April to ask him why the money appeared to be stuck in the Treasury, she was asked to write to him about the case.\n- Emma wrote a letter to him on the 18th April, as requested, setting out the details of the case.\n- On the 11th May, Emma tabled a written Parliamentary question asking when she would receive an answer to the letter.\n- Emma’s question was answered on the 17th May by the Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury, Robert Jenrick. The response was very confusing as it said the Trust had to submit its business case which had already been done.",

Is it worth the hype?\nClaim vs. Reality: Scrutinising the Devolution Deal\nAdvocates of the devolution deal argue it gives greater autonomy and decision-making power at the local level. However, upon closer examination, it becomes evident that the proposed deal is not the true devolution it claims to be. Instead, it is mainly a transfer of powers from the local authority to a mayor with little real devolution of power from Parliament.\nAside from the ability to potentially set up bus franchising, all the Mayoral powers over transport, housing and skills are things both councils currently do, working together where they see advantages in that. The Mayor’s other ability, to set up “Development Corporations” will remove the Councils’ planning and compulsory purchase powers in specified areas, making them less susceptible to democratic control and leaving local Councillors powerless to intervene to protect residents interests against powerful players.\nThe Financial Façade: Peeling Back the Numbers\nThe headline figure of £400 million may catch the eye, but a deeper look reveals a different story. In reality, this amounts to £13 million per year over thirty years which is a meagre benefit after factoring in election costs and the mayor’s office expenses. In light of the severe budget cuts we’ve endured through austerity and the desperate financial struggle both councils are facing, it’s apparent that this deal falls well short of addressing the financial challenges our region faces.\nAnother particular concern is the likely increase in council tax from a mayoral precept which is an additional charge added to your council tax. This would place a burden on residents already facing a cost-of-living crisis. With both East Riding of Yorkshire County Council and Hull City Council contemplating a 5% maximum-allowed council tax hike, it’s crucial to question whether an additional charge with little real devolution to benefit is the right path for our community, especially given the current economic uncertainties.\nA Comparative Analysis: Hull and East Yorkshire vs. Other Regions\nWhen you compare the deal for our area with those of other regions with combined authorities and a real power transfer from London, ours feels second rate. I’ve attached a table which shows you the deals for other Yorkshire regions in comparison to Hull and East Yorkshire’s.\nVoicing Concerns: Advocating for Genuine Devolution\nI fully support real devolution and we deserve a devolution deal that genuinely empowers our local councils, respects the unique needs of our region, and addresses funding shortfalls affecting essential services. The current proposal falls short of these expectations, offering a mere token gesture of devolution while maintaining a top-down decision-making approach.\nAs the Labour Party proposes a “take back control” bill, promising genuine devolution within its first 100 days if successful in the upcoming election, one may wonder why both councils opted for a deal at the end of this parliament. Perhaps waiting for potential offers post-General Election would have yielded more substantial outcomes.\nTime to Act: Participate in the Consultation\nNow is the time for you to voice your concerns and demand a better deal for Hull and East Yorkshire. The ongoing consultation provides a platform for you to make your opinions known. Let’s unite in advocating for a devolution deal that genuinely empowers our local authorities, safeguards essential services, and prioritises the well-being of our community.\nPlease respond to the consultation, share your thoughts, and let’s collectively work towards a future where genuine devolution becomes a reality.\nYou have until 27th February: https://www.smartsurvey.co.uk/s/heydevolution",

I will be attending a meeting of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Mesh which will be attended by Members of the Scottish Parliament. This will allow us to discuss recent victories on Mesh and related issues (I was, for example, delighted to see that the Department of Health and Social Care has agreed to provide physiotherapy to new mums through the NHS) and plan the next steps going forward.\nI will then attend a meeting with Chris Blackmore, Chair of the Humberside Local Resilience Forum and Chief Fire Officer for Humberside, to discuss the steps to be taken in the event of a no deal Brexit. I have significant concerns about the impact that such an outcome will place on Hull and will be continuing to set out my concerns both to Chris and more widely.\nI will also be speaking in a debate about lowering the age of availability for smear tests. 584 people signed this petition in Hull and Hessle. The debate comes on the back of a fall to the lowest take up of smear tests in 20 years with only 73% of women offered a smear test attending the test in Hull in 2016/17, the last set of data that is available. I will be arguing that more needs to be done to encourage women to take up the opportunity for these smear tests.\nTuesday\nOn Tuesday, the main order of business is the second meaningful vote on the EU Withdrawal Agreement. I voted against the deal. Despite suffering the biggest defeat in the history of Parliament, the government have refused to work in the national interest by listening to politicians from across the House of Commons and Business and Trade Union leaders outside of it. Very little of significance has changed with this deal and I will be voting against it again.\nWednesday\nOn Wednesday, I will be meeting, along with Diana Johnson and Karl Turner, with representatives of Marks and Spencer to discuss the closure of the Whitefriargate store. This conversation will be a follow up on my previous discussions with the store and, although I’m currently unable to say much about the content of the discussions, the people of Hull should rest assured that their three Labour MPs are working hard to find a solution to the issue that is in the interests of the shop’s workers, local residents and the future of Hull.\nThursday\nOn Thursday, I will be holding my New Year Community Health Check to encourage people to get regular health checks and to promote health and wellbeing in Hull West and Hessle generally. The average life expectancy for Hull is nearly 2 years less than the national average of 80 and, in some of the poorer parts of the city it can be a lot lower. It’s vital that people get problems sorted early before they develop further and this event that my office has organised is designed to do just that. We currently have nearly 200 people signed up to come along to the event and I’m very much looking forward to attending.\nFriday\nOn Friday, I will be in my constituency office meeting with constituents and assisting them with the issues they face.",

Following this, I will be asking a question during Defence Questions. Since being elected, I have done all that I can to support our veterans and their organisations and it was a pleasure recently to meet with Steve from Hull Veterans Support Centre on Beverley Road and Paul Matson from Hull for Heroes. I will be asking the Minister to meet with me to discuss how he can support the building of a Veterans Village in Hull.\nAlso on Monday, I will be launching a video to raise awareness of Peer to Peer Sexual Abuse that I recorded with Jess Phillips MP. Members of the Women and Equalities Select Committee and the Education Select Committee, Jess Phillips MP and Emma Hardy MP are joining forces to highlight 2018 guidance to schools about child-on-child sexual violence to help prevent victims having to share classroom space with their alleged attackers. Recommendations published by the Government last year say in relation to allegations of rape and assault by penetration, “Whilst the school or college establishes the facts of the case and starts the process of liaising with children’s social care and the police, the alleged perpetrator should be removed from any classes they share with the victim”. However, recent research by Teacher Tapp shows that the vast majority of teachers are not even aware the new guidance exists. Even fewer numbers had received training.\nIn addition to this, there is a chance that Theresa May will be bringing back her meaningful vote for a third time. It will come as no surprise to anyone that I will be voting against the deal. It is time for Parliament to take control through a series of indicative votes so that we can establish what there is a majority for in Parliament so that a new negotiating position can be established to make sure we are able to leave the EU with a good deal.\nTuesday\nOn Tuesday, I will be attempting to ask a question to the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care. If I am called, my question will be about my constituent Angie who first raised the issue of surgical mesh implants with me. Angie has had to put her mesh removal on hold for a while as she must continually travel to either Manchester or London for pre-op procedures, something she finds exceptionally difficult because of her mesh related injuries. I will be arguing that the NHS is one organisation and that Angie should be able to have her procedures in Hull without having to travel all over the country.\nWednesday\nOn Wednesday, the Education Select Commiittee will be meeting to discuss the issue of knife crime. In January and February 2019 there were 41 fatal stabbings in England and Wales. This figure is the highest since records began and has led to a renewed debate around the causes of and solutions to knife crime. Police commissioners have linked exclusions and knife crime and school and sector leaders have expressed disappointment in the implication that schools are responsible for the rising rates of knife crime. This session is an opportunity for the Committee to follow up on its report: ‘Forgotten children: alternative provision and the scandal of ever increasing exclusions, and to explore the role the education and children’s services sectors could play in preventing and protecting children from knife crime’.\nFollowing this in the afternoon, I will be speaking in a local government finance debate in Westminster Hall. As well as highlighting the grave situation whereby Hull City Council has lost one pound in every three from its budget, I will be highlighting the dire need for more money to be put into our road network to allow us to repair and redevelop key roads such as Calvert Lane and for more to be done to support walking and cycling in the city. A good walking and cycling strategy is vital to reduce traffic in a city and bring down levels of pollutions and greenhouse gas emissions and I am proud that Hull City Council has recently allocated £2.5 million of funding to support this but the central government in Westminster must do more to offer further support to our city on this matter.\nThursday\nOn Thursday, my meetings include Unite the Union, Hessle High School and the Army Engagement Team. I will also be making a visit to the A63 site.\nFriday\nOn Friday, my meetings include Matt Jukes and Cllr Hester Bridges. I will also be holding my surgery in the Octagon.

If they voted to leave then they still want to leave and if they voted to remain then they still want to remain. The thing that has changed is because of the total and utter mess the Conservatives have made of Brexit people are polarising into extreme positions.\nAs a Labour MP it is frustrating to be held responsible for the failure of the Tories to sort out Brexit and I know things would have been different if Labour was in power. The time for Theresa May to compromise was three years ago following the referendum, not a half hearted insincere attempt two weeks before the euro elections.\nDuring the General Election in 2017 I promised to fight for a good deal for Hull West and Hessle. I said I respected the result of the referendum and I still respect the result. During that election campaign the idea of ‘no deal’ was never mentioned and nor was it mentioned by the official leave campaign. There are recordings, quotes, statements from Leave EU all arguing for a deal and in fact arguing that Article 50 should not be triggered without a deal. Labour have stayed true to this promise and Jeremy Corbyn set out in his letter to Theresa May months ago the Brexit deal Labour would support.\nBut for the betrayal narrative of the extreme right wing politics to work the Brexit Party must keep moving the goal posts. No Brexit will ever be Brexity enough. Any hint of a deal or compromise will face screaming chants of “betrayal” because to survive they need to feed off the betrayal narrative. We can already see the ludicrous situation of Tory leadership hopefuls competing over who’s got the ‘biggest Brexit.’\nI respect everyone’s choice in the 2016 referendum. Indeed, some of my family voted leave and some voted remain and each has their own reason for their vote.\nMP’s have never been faced with a binary ‘in vs out’ Brexit vote, had it come to that I would respect the wishes of my constituents in the referendum. But politics is never so clear cut, there are many shades of grey around the Brexit question.\nWhat we were asked to vote on was Theresa May’s Withdrawal Bill and I voted against this because it is a bad deal for our country. I was pleased to vote for Labour’s Brexit alternative Brexit plan. I also voted for Brext 2.0 which is a sensible compromise, yes to delivering Brexit but on sound economic footing which safeguards workers rights and environmental protections that shape the society we aspire to deliver for future generations.\nThe EU elections were not a good night for Labour in Hull but, as your MP I’ll always do what’s right and not what’s easy. It would be easy for me to join the ‘no deal’ chanting and, to quote Boris, “f**k business.” I might get more votes but I’m sure I could never be that utterly selfish. I will always act to prevent a no deal Brexit. Hull West and Hessle is my home and will always be my home, I could never inflict such harm on my community, my friends and my family.\nThe Brexit fog that permeates our politics is hiding from the headlines the real crises austerity is having upon people in Hull West and Hessle. The cost of living is ever increasing and life is becoming harder. We have a mental health crisis for our children and the increasing number of suicides should shame our country. I know that things will only improve for our community, our children and our elderly when we have a Labour government committed to ending austerity and transforming lives. To win a general election Labour must be an inclusive broad based outward looking party and not simply reflect a narrow political point of view. Whether you voted remain or leave, a Labour government offers hope and the opportunity to rise together and that’s a future worth fighting for.",

Although the site is not in my constituency, BAE are a big local employer and the men and women who work on the Eurofighter are highly skilled workers. The loss of these jobs is going to have an appalling impact on them, the local economy and wider supply chains.\nWhile it is BAE that has taken this decision, it is this Conservative government’s decisions on defence spending that have ultimately led to this situation. They must come forward urgently with a clear plan to secure these jobs at BAE.\nThe major reason that has led to this job loss is the slowdown in orders for the Hawk aircraft that is made at the site at Brough, but the Government could take immediate steps to help this by ordering 9 new Hawks for the Red Arrows and bring forward a Defence Industrial strategy that supports service personnel, industry, British manufacturing and jobs all along the supply chain.",
  "https_www_emmahardy_org_uk_/https_www_emmahardy_org_uk_2021_01_21_q-and-a-on-the-astrazeneca-oxford-covid-19-vaccine-azd1222/content_298.html": "British Society for Immunology\nPlease note that the answers to the following questions apply in relation to the AstraZeneca/Oxford COVID-19 vaccine, and some answers will be different for other COVID-19 vaccines.\nRollout\nWho is eligible to receive the vaccine?\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has prioritised people for vaccination based on their risk of serious COVID-19 disease after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The priority order, confirmed on 2nd December and subject to logistical challenges in rollout, is as follows:\n- Residents in a care home for older adults and their carers\n- All those 80 years of age and over; frontline health and social care workers\n- All those 75 years of age and over\n- All those 70 years of age and over; clinically extremely vulnerable individuals\n- All those 65 years of age and over\n- All individuals aged 16 years to 64 years with underlying health conditions which put them at higher risk of serious disease and mortality\n- All those 60 years of age and over\n- All those 55 years of age and over\n- All those 50 years of age and over\nAs more vaccine becomes available, it will be rolled out to those in each descending group.\nWhy are older people being prioritised over younger people who are out of the house working?\nThe priorities are based on reducing risk of harm. The immune system in older people differs from that of younger people and whilst the younger, working population are just as likely to become infected they are much, much less likely to become severely ill. An older person becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 is more likely to result in severe COVID-19 disease and require hospitalisation. The biggest risk of dying from COVID-19 comes with age, even more so than underlying conditions such as cardiovascular disease or diabetes, for example, or being male or being in BAME groups. With each 20 year increase in age the risk of dying from COVID-19 increases by approximately 10 times. When a vaccine has been shown to be effective in preventing disease in older people, then they should be the first to receive it as they are most at risk.\nDo I need to get the vaccine if I have contracted COVID-19 and recovered?\nYes. There is a lot of uncertainty about how much immunity a person gains after natural infection. The levels of immunity that we can measure so far show a lot of individual variation – some people have very few antibodies after infection, but these antibodies can be boosted by vaccination. We can’t assume that everyone who has had COVID-19 would have enough immunity to protect them. It is likely that, in a significant proportion of the population, the vaccine will induce more effective and longer lasting immunity than that induced by infection. Hence it is recommended that everyone take the vaccine so that, if your immunity after disease is absent or low, it can be boosted.\nWhy should a young person take the vaccine when the risk of COVID-19 mortality is so low?\nThere is a huge variability in the symptoms and severity of COVID-19 disease between different people; from an infection with SARS-CoV-2 that doesn’t have any symptoms (asymptomatic infection) to severe COVID-19 disease resulting in hospitalisation and in some cases death. While younger people are usually at the less severe end of the spectrum this does not mean that the illness is not harmful to their health. In fact, there are many instances of long COVID that have blighted the lives of young people.\nIn addition, although we don’t yet have a lot of evidence to support this, having the vaccine might stop you being able to be part of the chain of infection that spreads the virus. So, an added benefit might be to help reduce spread of the virus for everybody.\nThere is COVID-19 at my child’s school. Why aren’t my children being given the vaccine?\nInitial vaccine testing was not done on children. Children are at extremely low risk of becoming severely ill with COVID-19 – they are at higher risk of being involved in a serious traffic accident than they are of ending up in hospital with COVID-19. So the benefits of vaccinating children are not yet clear. If the vaccine stops people from passing the infection to others, then vaccinating children in order to stop the spread of the virus will make a lot of sense.\nSafety\nDoes the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine being developed so quickly mean that it is less safe than other vaccines?\nNo, it doesn’t. The reasons that this was developed so quickly do not include cutting corners on safety. There are a few reasons that enabled the speed in 2020:\n- Technology. This viral vector vaccine (in common with many of the approaches used for the other vaccine candidates) could be rapidly deployed for development and testing once the SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequence became known, but this was actually done on the back of almost ten years prior research using this method of producing vaccines.\n- Scientists. A LOT of scientists contributed to this, working extra long hours to make it work and to assess the results.\n- Money. Normally raising money to develop a vaccine takes a long time. At each stage you have to stop and apply for more funding to carry out the next stage. Funding applications take a year or more. In 2020 for SARS-CoV-2, rapid investment of a lot of taxpayers’ money in many countries meant there weren’t the normal financial obstacles.\n- Environment. Sometimes you can develop a vaccine but can’t test it until there is an epidemic in progress. There was no problem in this regard.\n- Luck. Sometimes the target that is picked for vaccine studies, which is usually something seen on the outside of the virus, is not a good candidate for raising an immune response. The S protein target on SARS-CoV-2 that most vaccine companies picked to work with turns out to be an excellent target for activating the immune response.\n- Volunteer test subjects. Last but definitely not least. Tens of thousands of volunteers took part in the safety trials and the randomised control trials so recruiting volunteers was not an issue as it may be under normal circumstances.\n- Testing. Normally the various phases of safety testing happen sequentially, often because of financial restraints, in this case safety testing happened concurrently.\nAre there any side effects from the vaccine?\nYes, but these are generally mild. As with all vaccines, because you are stimulating the immune system you may experience some mild flu-like symptoms, but these are temporary. The most common reactions are fatigue, headache and pain at the injection site. Some people might also get chills, joint pain or fever.\nShould people with allergies take the vaccine?\nMost people with allergies can have the vaccine. For example, some allergies, such as hay fever, are mild and do not pose a risk. The MHRA recommends that people with a history of anaphylaxis to food, an identified drug or vaccine, or an insect sting CAN receive any COVID-19 vaccine, as long as they are not known to be allergic to any component of the vaccine. The vaccine should not be given to people who have a history of immediate-onset anaphylaxis to any of the vaccine’s components. If you carry an EpiPen in case of allergic reaction, you have a history of immediate-onset anaphylaxis and so should discuss this with your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before getting the vaccine. People are asked to remain at the vaccination centre for a short period of time after receiving their vaccination so that the healthcare professionals can check there is no immediate adverse response to the vaccine.\nWho should not get the vaccine? (I’m immunocompromised/pregnant etc.)\nThe AstraZeneca/Oxford COVID-19 vaccine has not yet been tested on pregnant women or children so these groups should only be vaccinated where the benefit of vaccination is thought to outweigh any potential harm, and should be discussed on an individual basis. Similar adenoviral vectored vaccines have been used safely in children and pregnant women for other infectious diseases (e.g. malaria and Ebola).\nImmunocompromised people are at high risk so should get the vaccine. Although the AstraZeneca/Oxford COVID-19 vaccine contains a live adenovirus, it has been modified so that the virus is unable to replicate in humans, so unlike other ‘live’ vaccines, it is safe for people with compromised immune systems. However, because their immune systems may not be able to make a response to vaccine they should still take other precautions against the disease.\nWho was the AstraZeneca/Oxford COVID-19 vaccine tested on?\nIn the phase 3 clinical trial, half the volunteers had the COVID-19 vaccine and the rest were given a MenACWY (meningitis) vaccine, or saline solution, as control. Volunteers were from Brazil, and UK, other trials are continuing in South Africa and USA.\nIn the data published so far, from the UK and Brazil, there were 5,807 COVID-19 vaccine recipients and 5829 in the control group. Of the COVID-19 vaccine recipients, 88% were aged between 18 and 55, 12% were aged over 55. 17% were BAME, 39% were male. People characterised as high risk due to underlying conditions (e.g. cardiovascular disease; diabetes; respiratory disease) or due to high risk occupations were included.\nAre there risks that might have been missed in the trials, but will become apparent in the longer term?\nAll known risks have been checked, but there may be unknown risks. Reactions to vaccines usually happen very soon after vaccination – if you have the vaccine, you are asked to wait at the vaccination centre for a few minutes as a precaution. All the initial phase 1 safety trial volunteers have been followed up for at least 7 months and no major concerns have been raised. Safety monitoring, known as pharmacovigilance, is to be continued for 2 years after the vaccine is released; in the UK, this is carried out by the MHRA.\nHow are long term side effects tested/monitored?\nSafety monitoring is to be continued for 2 years after the vaccine is released. There is a system in place (known as the yellow card system; https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/) to monitor and report adverse events immediately in a process known as pharmacovigilance. In the UK, this is carried out by the MHRA.\nEffectiveness\nDoes immunity from the vaccine last longer than immunity after getting COVID-19?\nWe do not know the answer to this question yet because people have only been followed up for a maximum of 7 months after vaccination so far. We suspect that in some cases (e.g. mild or asymptomatic infection), the immunity elicited by the vaccine would be better than that elicited by the natural infection, but we do not know for sure. But, from the concentrations of antibodies induced by the vaccine, and the rate at which these antibodies decline over time, it is looking very promising that immunity induced by the vaccine will last at least as long as the immunity induced by infection and in all likelihood it will last much longer.\nDo I still need to wear a mask or observe social distancing after receiving the vaccine?\nYes. We know the vaccine can protect people from getting sick from the disease COVID-19 that is caused by the viral infection. However, we do not yet know if being vaccinated will stop you from getting the viral infection, so you could be an asymptomatic carrier who could pass the infection onto others who may be vulnerable.\nAlso, you will not be protected against the disease until at least three weeks after your first dose and you will not be fully protected until three weeks after your second dose.\nOther\nHow do viral vector vaccines, such as the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine, work?\nThis type of vaccine uses an unrelated harmless virus (the viral vector) to deliver SARS-CoV-2 genetic material into the body. When administered, our cells use the genetic material to produce a specific viral protein, which is recognised by our immune system and triggers a response. This response builds immune memory, so your body can fight off the virus in the future.\nAre the changes to the times between the first and second doses of the vaccine safe? Will it cause the virus to mutate?\nThe British Society for Immunology has issued a statement laying out our thoughts on this complex issue. Although we would prefer the original dosing schedules tested in the trials to be used clinically, we recognise that with the extremely high current case numbers, a pragmatic approach in the short-term is needed, and accept the rationale for the change in dosing schedule to a 12-week gap between first and second dose recommended by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). There is evidence for the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine that a 12 week interval may be better than 4 weeks. It is important to emphasise that people do need to go back to get their second dose to receive full protection.,\nModelling data has shown that vaccination has by far the largest chance of reducing the disease burden and death rate compared with other measures. Any risks from actions taken now must be balanced against risks of actions not taken. Concerns over hypothetical consequences of putting the virus under pressure to mutate from non-sterilising vaccine regimes have to be balanced against a view of what we would face through the virus spreading at the current rate in our communities.\nWill the vaccine be effective against different variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus?\nThe human immune system is diverse and dynamic so we think it will, but we don’t yet know this for a fact in all variants. We will need to monitor emerging virus variants and continually check (in the lab) whether serum from vaccinated people can neutralise them. So far there is no evidence that the UK variant can escape from antibodies made in response to the old variant. There is some evidence that another variant might be able to escape, and studies are ongoing to investigate this further. If we find any significant reduction in neutralisation of variant viruses, we may need to subtly tweak the vaccine to induce a broader repertoire of neutralising antibodies.",

In the letter they asked FCC Environment – a recipient of Government contracts – to ‘strive to undertake your business practices to a high standard that promotes equality and respect amongst and towards your employees and to conduct yourselves in a manner fitting the dignity of your position.’\nEmma Hardy MP added, “This firm benefits from Government contracts and as such I expect them to play by the rules recognised by most people as being fair. Namely sick pay for all – not just those at the top. Workers have been on strike three times over this – and I fully support them. I hope that FCC Environment bosses sit up and take notice.

Even fewer numbers had received training.\nEmma Hardy MP said:\n“Failing to follow guidance which has been specifically designed to support both victim and alleged perpetrator is causing significant harm. We’ve heard of several worrying cases where teenage girls have had to share a classroom with their alleged attacker. It’s no surprise to learn that these girls can’t cope and soon stop attending classes altogether. The guidance is there for a reason so it’s important to get it out there into schools and colleges so they can give the best support possible.”\nJess Phillips MP added:\n“The guidance will only work if every teacher is given the tools and training so they know what to do should they be involved in supporting a young person who reports sexual violence. We’re highlighting this today and asking our fellow MPs to flag it up with schools in their own constituencies to help make sure that happens.”",

But these cuts are having a real effect on people’s lives. Because of Government funding cuts, Hull City Council has lost 1 in every 3 pounds it had in 2010. If you’d like a statistic to show just how close to the bone these funding reductions are cutting then you only have to know that 3 in every 5 pounds of all spending by Hull City Council is spent on Children’s Services and Adult Social Care.\n“It’s no wonder that councils do not have the room to fix potholes or collect bins. Today I spoke in Parliament to argue that the government needs to reassess local government funding to ensure that cities like Hull with high needs, significant deprivation and a very low tax base are not left behind. I will be pushing the government to make sure they don’t”\nContext\n- Emma spoke during the Opposition Day debate on Local Government Funding which took place in the House of Commons on Wednesday 28th March 2018.\n- Against a background of reductions in central government grants and local authority retention of business rates, Hull has lost a significant portion of its spending power, losing £1 in every 3 since 2010.\n- This has had a severe effect on the ability of Hull City Council and East Riding of Yorkshire Council to deliver on vital services such as Children and Young Person’s Services and Adult Social Care. In Hull, spending on Adult Social Care and Children and Young Person’s Services amounts to 60% of Council Spending.\n- Hull City Council has been forced to cut £37.2 million since 2010 from its Children’s and Young Person’s Services budget since 2010. A report by End Child Poverty has revealed more than 20,000 children in the city are living below the poverty line. This amounts to one third of children in poverty. In East Yorkshire, just over 20 per cent of children live in the same conditions.\n- In Hull, the Myton ward – which includes the city centre – has the highest child poverty rate, at 47.9 per cent with St Andrews close behind at 47.5 per cent. Both wards are in Emma’s constituency.\n- Meanwhile there are there are 350 more children in need now than in 2010. 158 more children subject to a child protection plan than in 2010 and the number of looked after children has gone up by 140.\n- Two thirds more Hull residents require social care compared with the national average. Hull has lost half of its Central Government funding since 2010 and will be getting the lowest amount per head from the social care precept of any Yorkshire and Humber council.\n- It is the eighth biggest drop in expenditure on social care among councils across the UK. Conservative Government funding cuts mean there is £10m less money being spent on the elderly and vulnerable than there was three years ago.\n- East Riding Council face an increase in adult social care of over £21 Million and has a higher than national average percentage of the population of a pensionable age (25% in East Riding compared to 19% nationally).",

Instead I’ll be “paired” with an MP who would be voting for the bill. They then don’t vote, and so the overall result is not affected. But this is an informal arrangement, and it means on the official voting record I will go down as having no vote recorded.\nIt is really important to me that no-one thinks I am anything but totally opposed to this dishonest and worse-than-useless Bill.\nOf course we need to end the hazardous Channel crossings that are putting lives at risk, and Labour has plans that will do that. We would\n- Go after the criminal gangs facilitating and profiting from the dangerous Channel crossings to the tune of hundreds of millions of pounds, which this government continues to fail to do, with people smuggler convictions halved from four years ago. We would create a new Cross-Border Police Unit, funded by the money still being wasted on the failed Rwanda scheme.\n- Reform the resettlement schemes which are simply not working. The Afghan Resettlement Scheme has seen only 22 successful applications this year, while more than 8,000 desperate Afghans have crossed the Channel on boats.\n- Clear the backlog and end hotel use. The Home Office is taking 40% fewer asylum decisions a year than they were in 2015, leaving people waiting in limbo for much longer and pushing up accommodation costs. Caseworkers are under-resourced, demoralised and quitting. The government refuse to streamline the process by prioritising cases as recommended by a UN report.\n- Negotiate a new agreement with European countries which includes return agreements and properly managed alternative arrangements such as family reunion. This bill, in breach of the ECHR, makes this impossible.\n- Work in partnership internationally to address some of the humanitarian crises that are leading people to flee their homes, including restoring the 0.7% aid commitment when the fiscal situation allows and strengthening support for the people of Afghanistan.\nThe “Illegal Migration Bill” will do none of this. It proposes the creation of detention camps, at as yet unspecified locations, for people to await deportation through agreements that haven’t and cannot be negotiated. By removing any protections for victims of trafficking and sex-slavery it strengthens the traffickers themselves.\nThis bill is just more of the same from this government – a new slogan, some junk legislation and try to blame everyone else for a problem they created in the first place. I will have further opportunities to vote against this bill when I am better, and I will take them.",

In 2007, Hull was hit by floods causing £40 million worth of damage and many still have vivid memories of the water devastating our city.\nWithin Ms Hardy’s constituency of Hull West and Hessle only the wards of Hessle (35%) and Newington and Gipsyville (95%) have less than 98% of their population within flood risk category 3. (1)\nEmma Hardy MP said:\n“In 2020, the UN’s environment programme highlighted that increased flooding is likely to be one of the early visible signs of this climate change. In Hull and the East Riding of Yorkshire, and indeed in Yorkshire, the Midlands, the South West and the South East, this is something we understand.”\n“We understand it because it’s something that has happened to us recently with Storm Ciara and Storm Dennis. We can all remember when the run-off from fields closed the A63 in November 2019 and blocked Hull off from the M62.”\n“There have been some improvements over the years such as the Flood Re scheme but this needs improvement. The Bill I have proposed calls for 5 areas of change. Firstly, to set out binding planning requirements for properties, enforced by local authorities. Secondly, to create a scheme, binding on the insurance industry, to recognise when a home has obtained flood prevention measures; and thirdly, to extend the Flood Re scheme further.”\n“Finally, the Flood Re scheme needs to cover newbuilds after 2009 and it needs to cover small and medium enterprises as well.”\n“A survey I carried out in my constituency over the summer shows that these changes are also supported by many members of the public too. When it comes to support for these measures today, we should remember that the tide is rising, both literally and metaphorically and now is the time to act.”",

I’ll be meeting with the Labour Brexit team. Following this, I’ll be attempting to ask a question to the Home Secretary Sajid Javid about the safety of Afghan Sikhs asylum seekers who may get sent back to their country because of out of date safety reports held by the Home Office. Sikhs have faced a more difficult time in Afghanisation since Ashraf Ghani became President in 2014. July this year saw 12 leading Afghan Sikhs killed in a suicide attack. Yet Home Office guidance, most recently from 2013 describes the area as safe for Sikhs. This is having an effect on Afghan Sikhs including those in Hull and I will be asking the Minister to meet with me to discuss updating the guidance. I’ll also be meeting with Therese Coffey MP, the Minister responsible for flood defence to talk about the National Flood Resilience Centre.\nTuesday\nOn Tuesday, the Education Select Committee will be holding a hearing on Special Educational Needs and Disabilities. During the session, members will have the chance to ask a panel of parents about their experiences of the SEND system and the impact of the Children and Families Act 2014 reforms. The discussion with the second panel will explore the role of Parent Carer Forums and how they view the reforms.\nTuesday is also the day that the House of Commons begins to debate the Withdrawal Agreement that was recently struck between the government and the other 27 member states of the EU. There will be 5 days of debate before a vote takes place next Tuesday. As a Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Brexit team, I will be unable to participate in the debate but I will join other colleagues from all parties in voting down Theresa May’s disastrous deal for the country in line with the wishes of many of my constituents.\nWednesday\nOn Wednesday, I will be sitting in the Chamber participating in Day 2 of the Withdrawal Agreement debate.\nThursday\nOn Thursday, I will be asking a question to the Leader of the House of Commons, Andrea Leadsom, about Endometriosis. While I have been campaigning on the issue for a number of months now, it is still vital that awareness is raised. Predictions by the charity Endometriosis UK show that 1 in 10 women in the UK suffers from endometriosis. I will be asking the Leader of the House whether we can have a debate about the topic to raise awareness of these issues.\nFriday\nOn Friday, I will be holding my regular monthly surgeries throughout the constituency. Details of surgeries can be found by calling my office on 01482 219211.",

He has been know where near the North, yet again. When there is an emergency, it is vital that the PM stands us and reassures us, that the government are dealing with the crisis on hand. I have heard horror stories about peoples homes being destroyed by the flooding and they’ve not heard a peep from the government.\nDoes he think that hiding from the media removes him from the blame? He has once again proven he is not worthy of your vote and not worthy to run our country.\nAnyway, back to Westminster, and the main issues I have spoken on this week are as follows:\nDevolution\nWith all the news regarding South Yorkshire agreeing a devolution deal and Leeds city working on one, I have been very concerned regarding what is going to happen to Hull. There seems to be confusion regarding priorities and deciding issues from the Government.\nWe need to work cross-party to ensure that Hull does not miss out on gaining devolved powers from Parliament. I will continue to push for a devolved deal based on the Humber because that is the economic model we need.\nGovernment Reshuffle\nThis month’s Cabinet chaos showed that Boris Johnson is out of control. With just a few weeks to go until the Budget he is more concerned with internal power games than the future of the country.\nHe has given the Presidency of COP26 (the Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change UNFCCC) to someone with a record of voting against climate change measures, appointed an Attorney General who has argued against the Human Rights Act, and an International Development Secretary who has questioned overseas development aid.\nBoris Johnson’s new cabinet is now even less diverse, with more male, white and privately educated ministers than his last one. He broke his promise to promote a record number of women, meaning three quarters of Cabinet Ministers are men.\nIn summary, a total shambles.\nChild Services\nI spoke in the House about the alarming number of children under our care in Hull and I got an agreement from the Minister to have a meeting with all the Hull MP’s to discuss how we can makes sure we have the fair funding agreement in Hull to help those most at risk.\nFlooding\nI also got the Secretary of State for Environment George Eustice to agree to come and talk to the Lagoon Hull project team to discuss how we can better protect Hull from flooding and make our city sustainable for the future\nI am currently in negotiations to arrange both of these meetings so stayed tuned for updates.\nOn Tuesday Mr. Dan Carradice, Associate Chief Medical Officer and Consultant Vascular and Endovascular Surgeon and I met with the Health Minister Edward Argar MP to discuss vascular care, lower limb amputations and patient outcomes for people in Hull. We also talked about what we needed in Hull to improve Hull’s vascular service infrastructure to reduce local lower limb amputation rates.\nThe meeting went really well. The Minister listened carefully as Dr Dan made a compelling case for investment and he has offered to come to Hull to meet patients, visit the ward, talk to Dan again and see the problems we face first hand. He has also asked for more information on specifically what we need to be sent to him.\nThis is really positive step forward for the campaign and something I intend to build on before the Minister arrives. If you are interested in supporting me with the campaign to increase investment and raise awareness in Vascular disease then just email me on emma.hardy.mp@parliament.uk or message below.\nThursday was a meeting with Chief Superintendent Darren Downs this afternoon to discuss the improvements that have been made in the city to reduce anti-social behaviour and the movement and allocation of future police resources. It was great to hear positive changes have taken place and it is now important for everyone to work together to maintain standards and continue to improve the situation moving forwards. Many thanks to Darren, his team and all the agencies involved for all their hard work.\nNow on Friday I had a great meeting back in Hull with Endeavour and the adult education students and one of my fave questions ever came about the catering in Parliament and if it’s any good. Well the good news it is good, and there are 3 different cafes to go to, they are of the type you get in a normal workplace, were you queue up with a tray and shuffle along filling your plate until you reach the till, nothing particular fancy. But you can get a meaty feast wrap for breakfast which is a flatbread stuffed with black pudding, bacon, sausage etc.\nThis question has also given me an idea to start sharing with you my day to day life in Parliament. From things like the toilets getting blocked to the kind of food we can get in the cafes to missing the tube needed to get to a meeting on time. So watch this space…\nI truly hope you all have a great weekend, I am going to spend a few days with my children and hopefully have a relaxing weekend as well.\nEmma x",

As an MP, I feel a moral duty to do everything I can to promote peace and an end to this bloodshed, and my prayers are with each and every person who is suffering.\nSince the horrific events on 7th October and throughout the ongoing conflict, I have and will continue to ask Government to do all they can to support getting humanitarian aid to those in Gaza, to ensure that international law is upheld and to make sure all Israeli hostages are released.\nThe events of October 7th happened when Parliament was in recess and therefore when parliament returned, I used the first opportunity on 18th October to speak in a debate in Parliament, calling for humanitarian corridors, access to aid and international law to be upheld.\nhttps://fb.watch/oAzZKP1cGR/\nOn 26th October, I wrote to then the Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Affairs, James Cleverley to ask that the British Government, call for international law to be upheld and support Palestinian refugees.\nI have also asked Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development affairs the following written questions:\n- 24th October- To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Affairs, what assessment he has made of the extent of the damage to the Islamic Relief offices in Gaza City.\n- 24th October and 7th November- To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Affairs, what assessment he has made of the adequacy of humanitarian aid supplies to Gaza; and what steps he is taking to support (a) Islamic Relief, (b) the Egyptian Red Crescent and (c) other aid agencies in delivering aid.\n- 7th November- To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Affairs, what steps he is taking to help secure the release of hostages taken by Hamas since 7 October 2023.\n- 7th November- West Bank- To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Affairs, what assessment he has made of the implications for his policies of the situation in the occupied West Bank territories; and whether he has had discussions with his regional counterparts on (a) supporting, (b) strengthening and (c) reforming the Palestinian Authority.\nThroughout the conflict I have shared and posted across my social media, calling for peace and to ensure those in need have access to essential aid. This includes on 22nd October sharing Lisa Nandy’s interview with BBC calling for an urgent upscale of aid to Gaza and on 25th October, sharing Keir Starmer’s call for pause so people can access humanitarian aid stating that “the only way to get aid to the innocent Palestinians is to have a humanitarian pause in all hostilities.”\nOn 30th October I met with Labour’s Muslim Network and heard about their concerns about the rise in islamophobia in the UK.\nOn 25th October I met with the Palestinian Ambassador to the UK to discuss the need for humanitarian aid to get to Gaza.\nOn 14th November I met with Labour Friend’s of Israel and heard about their concerns over rising levels of antisemitism in the UK.\nOn 15th November I again, spoke in a debate in Parliament thanking Islamic relief for their work to provide aid to those in Gaza and calling for siege conditions to be lifted with aid and essential supplies switched back on.\nhttps://fb.watch/oAzQQieFGS/\nOn 15th November I voted for Labour’s amendment calling for an “enduring cessation of fighting” and a “credible, diplomatic and political process to deliver the lasting peace of a two state solution.”\nhttps://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=914143506975569&set=a.468883471501577\nOn Monday 20th November I asked the Secretary of State what the Government is doing to ensure that unrestricted aid is reaching all the people that need it and that importantly, Israel lifts siege conditions.\nhttps://fb.watch/oAzLyY85Nu/\nOn Wednesday 22nd November I had a moving call with the Palestinian Ambassador to the UK. We discussed the humanitarian situation, which is devastating beyond words and practically what needs to happen in order for there to be a permanent two state solution.\nhttps://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=918354523221134&set=a.468883471501577\nOn Monday 11th December I questioned Government Ministers about UN Security Council being unable to find the wording for a resolution they could all agree to stop fighting in Palestine and save lives. I said that we need to make political progress towards the permanent ceasefire we all desperately want.\nhttps://www.facebook.com/EmmaHardyHullWestandHessle/videos/1851869345323127\nAs Parliament returned from recess on Monday 8th January 2024, I questioned Government Ministers about an International Coalition for a two-state solution, how likely that is to be engage the Israeli Government and what Britain’s role in that coalition will be. I also urged the point that Palestine must be run by Palestinians and there should be no forced resettlement. See my full question and the response below-\nOn 22nd February I voted for Labour’s call for an immediate ceasefire in the region. This passed through Parliament.\nOn 27th February I urged the Government to do everything possible and work with the international community to prevent an Offensive in Rafah-https://www.facebook.com/share/v/8yrMhLo1Q1Mq6nVW/?mibextid=WC7FNe\nOn 19th March I asked the Government to resume UNWRA funding to get aid into Gaza- https://www.facebook.com/share/v/UcFNzpmaLFcUUYWi/?mibextid=WC7FNe\nOn 25th March I urged the Government to build relationship and work with Middle Eastern countries to get help into Gaza- https://www.facebook.com/share/v/9DceKszF4MXkGHqt/?mibextid=WC7FNe\nOn 15th April I again asked the Government again about resuming funding to UNWRA to ensure aid gets to those who need it- https://www.facebook.com/share/v/XGqxsYZXHsiAuMa3/?mibextid=WC7FNe\nI stand against the rise in anti-Semitic abuse, threats and assaults at home and against the rise in Islamophobia. I do not want to see Britain become somewhere where Jewish schools are closed and Jewish families stay home and hide their identities. Nor do I want British Muslims to face increased Islamophobia or threats to their communities. I fully support police action and extra assistance for the safety of our communities.\nAt the forefront of my mind is always how the actions I take and the words I speak can try and help reduce the suffering of innocent Israelis and Palestinians. I want to assure every one of my commitment to calling for an enduring cessation of fighting. At this moment the chance of peace feels incredibly far away but I know that conflict only ever ends through dialogue and a negotiated peace process, and I will always speak up for it.",

It continues to be a busy time for me in Westminster, with a full ministerial diary and so much still to do. I count myself fortunate to have such hard-working staff who provide support and outreach work in the community when I’m in Parliament, and the best part of my week is still the time I spend in the constituency meeting residents and attending local events. This week is Parliament Week, an annual event to inform and educate people about the work and role of Parliament across the UK. As a part of that I’m really looking forward to visiting schools in the constituency to talk to pupils about the job of an MP and how government works.\nBus service for Well Lane/Parkway\nGood news! East Yorkshire buses now have a service for Well Lane and The Parkway in Willerby. It’s something constituents have contacted me about and I have written to East Yorkshire buses asking them to implement, so I am very pleased they have listened. It’s a revised number 26 service, which runs between Beverley, Cottingham, Castle Hill, Willerby, Anlaby and Hessle. Full timetable here.\nLabour is determined to improve our bus services and this week the Transport Secretary announced £1 billion of funding to support, improve and protect crucial bus services across the country. Every region in England will benefit from the funding – but particularly those areas which have been historically underserved, like rural areas and small towns. We are introducing new powers for every community to take back control of services and reforms to speed up the delivery of public control, alongside a new Buses Bill to end the postcode lottery of services.\nGreen Energy boost for Hull\nLabour’s commitment to decarbonising the economy, making the country a leader in green technologies and achieving energy security has paid off for Hull and our region. Siemens Gamesa has landed a £1 billion contract to produce wind turbine blades for the East Anglia TWO offshore wind farm at their factory in Hull.\nThis will support over 1,300 jobs in our area, with Hull at the heart of the UK’s clean energy revolution. The new turbines will provide clean energy to power almost 1 million homes.\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer said: “Our mission to make Britain a clean energy superpower is creating good jobs in towns like Hull while protecting future generations from the climate crisis.”\nMedical Aesthetic treatments\nRecently, a few people have contacted me with concerns over the regulation and licensing for Medical Aesthetic treatments.\nI’m really interested to hear local residents experiences of this and what their feeling are around licensing and regulation so I’d be really grateful if you could fill in this quick survey and I’ll use the results to help guide my next steps.\nIf you have suffered from poor treatment or you have concerns about someone offering treatments, you can now raise the issue with the Joint Council for Cosmetic Practitioners. Because the sector is currently unregulated, the JCCP is collecting evidence to help press the case for change. They also promise to look into what you say and provide you with support, advice and guidance. They want to hear from both the public and professionals in the sector. You can raise your concerns or experiences here.\nBathing water improvements\nAnother topic I would like your views on is something I am involved in as Minister for Water. These are proposals on modernising bathing water rules. Bathing waters are officially designated outdoor swimming sites and there are over 500 in England and Wales. I know many people love to wild swim whatever the weather which is why the proposals include flexibility in extending season dates. We would also like to put a greater focus on water quality and include other water users like surfers and paddle boarders too.\nYou can read the full proposals and have your say here.\nSmall business awards nominations\nIt’s Small Business Saturday on 7 December and to mark the day I am running my annual celebration of small businesses in the community with the Emma Hardy Small Business Award 2024. Make sure your favourite local business is in the running by nominating them here\nToo soon to mention Christmas?\nI’m not one to put up decorations in November, but I am starting to look forward to Christmas and the festive season. As always, there are lots of events on and these are some in the constituency:\nWomen in Business Awards\nIt was my great pleasure to be invited to the Women in Business Awards last week and meet some of the incredible nominees. It was wonderful to meet so many inspirational women and hear of their achievements. There was a celebrity presence in the form of Janet Street-Porter, who is still going strong!\nDawn from the HU4 Community Trust and Katie and Victoria from Endo Buddies were nominated for their outstanding work in the Voluntary Category. I have been a proud supporter of their work over the years, and I know how much they put into it, so it was great to see their efforts recognised.\nIrregular immigration\nThe Prime Minister promised to tackle the dangerous Channel crossings by targeting the people smugglers who exploit vulnerable individuals for profit. That promise is now turning into action. Last week, a Turkish man known as the “Boat King” was arrested in Amsterdam, accused of supplying hundreds of boat motors to smuggling networks. He has since been extradited to Belgium to face charges. This is a significant step in dismantling the supply chains fueling this illegal and exploitative trade, as part of a Europe-wide effort led by the UK to target the ringleaders of these criminal gangs.\nThese achievements are thanks to the establishment of the new Border Security Command, which coordinates action across agencies. Labour has bolstered the National Crime Agency (NCA) by recruiting specialist intelligence and investigation officers tasked with targeting organised immigration crime networks. The number of NCA officers stationed in Europol has also been increased by 50% to ensure international collaboration.\nThe Prime Minister also promised swift action for those who do not have a genuine claim to asylum. Since July 5th, 25 bespoke returns flights have taken off, including the three largest in history. 9,400 individuals with no legal right to remain in the UK have been returned to their home countries, including nearly 2,600 forced deportations – a 19% increase compared to 2023. Labour has also overseen a 14% rise in the removal of foreign criminals in the same period.\nLabour is also committed to tackling the exploitation of migrant workers by unscrupulous employers. Intensive Immigration Enforcement teams have conducted inspections at over 275 businesses, leading to 135 penalty notices issued to employers and 85 illegal workers detained for removal. These measures send a clear message that the exploitation of workers and undercutting of wages and conditions will not be tolerated.\nThis Labour government is delivering real results where others have failed. In just four and a half months, it has begun implementing effective, fair, and humane solutions to tackle illegal immigration and exploitation. Workers and communities deserve action, and Labour is proving it can deliver.\nLegacy ministerial meeting\nWe’re all aware of how deeply upsetting the events surrounding Legacy Funeral Directors have been for the families concerned and the wider community. It is shocking that the industry is unregulated, and this must change so that those awful events can never be repeated.\nUntil the trial has taken place, there are limitations on what can be said publicly, but I felt it was vital that the voices of those directly affected should be heard by those whose responsibility it is to frame any new legislation.\nI arranged for Tristan and Claire, whose Nana was one of the 35, to travel to Westminster and meet Alex Davies-Jones, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Victims. Together, they watched a video in which they and other victims of Legacy told their stories. It was difficult to watch, even as someone familiar with the events, and the minister was clearly moved. I was impressed by her empathy and understanding as she spoke with Tristan and Claire after the video. She was able to assure them that work was underway between the three departments involved – Justice, Home Office and Local Government – and that the families would have advance notice of any announcements before they became public.\nWe then made our way to Downing Street where Tristan and Claire presented a letter for the Prime Minister to an official on the steps of Number 10. The visit was covered by Look North.\nI’m so pleased Tristan and Claire felt they had been listened to and that the meeting was worthwhile. Of course, I will continue to push for regulations to be introduced as soon as possible.\nAnd finally…\nAs always, if you are a constituent and think I can support you in any way, please contact me either by mail at emma.hardy.mp@parliament.uk or ring my office phone, 01482 219211.

Emma has also asked several Parliamentary questions to the Ministry of Defence about issues such as securing more contracts for Hawk aircraft.\nCommenting, Emma said “I can’t say too much at the moment, other than to thank the trade unions for helping to organise it. There will be more information available next week but I am reassured of his commitment to the Brough site and I reiterate my commitment to maintaining the high quality jobs at the site.”",
  "https_www_emmahardy_org_uk_/https_www_emmahardy_org_uk_2020_02_07_notes-from-westminster-chapter-3/content_85.html": "This week in Westminster was action packed one.\nWe had the National Apprenticeship Week, questions in the House of Commons, APPG’s, lots of media appearances and a half-day tour around London as part of the All-Party Parliamentary Group Against Antisemitism.\nSo we kicked-off in Westminster with a question on defence and I asked how young people from disadvantaged backgrounds can achieve high ranking positions within the military, when public schools sometimes have officer recruitment bases on their grounds.\nI had an education team meeting with the rest of the shadow team and later on discussed the state of medical education and research in the UK.\nTuesday started with a few interview with Times Educational Supplement and FE Weekly who are the foremost publications in the UK regarding education. I spoke to them about National Apprenticeship Week and also on why the current apprenticeship levy is failing disadvantaged young people in gaining access to apprenticeships.\nI also dropped by to see some off the amazing work some companies and young people are doing with apprenticeships, and even though the levy policy is failing, there is still some great work being done.\nSo, despite the failings of the Apprentice Levy policy implemented by this government in 2017, there are rays of light within apprenticeships.\nWe used the ‘Looking Beyond’ phrase to overcome the stigma of old to help people understand that apprenticeships can be a great access to excellent careers.\nThis was followed by a few APPG on Sixth Form and the APPG on Apprenticeship Fair, finally there was the LBGT History Month reception and a quick hop across to Millbank for an interview with BBC Look North.\nWednesday began with another BBC interview and lots more NAW meetings. But I also managed to speak to the Rail Minister before finishing off the day with the Apprenticeship Award Ceremony.\nThursday saw me heading back to the constituency in the PM but not before a really fascinating tour around London as part of the APPG Against Antisemitism which involved visitng a Jewish day school and speaking to some pupils, a meeting on modern antisemitism and how to combat it, and finally a bit of lunch before the getting the train back to Hull.\nFriday, as I am typing, is back to the Surgeries, where I am meeting constituents to discuss local and national issues. A visit to Hull College and finally I am taking my children to the Bonus Arena for the Song for Hull event, which I can’t wait!\nJust before I wrap this up, I have a survey I would like you to fill out (if you are a constituent of Hull West & Hessle), the link is here and it will only take a few minutes of your time. It is about our future priorities following our exit from the EU, and how we can rebuild our communities after such a decisive topic. I would very much appreciate you giving me your thoughts.\nAnyway, I wish you all a great weekend, thank you for all your support and please do get in touch if you need to speak to me.",

  "https_www_emmahardy_org_uk_/https_www_emmahardy_org_uk_2023_07_07_july-2023-newsletter/content_62.html": "Dear Friend,\nI hope this finds you well. It’s been another busy month in London, but when I’m on my way back and the towers of the Humber Bridge come into view I get that lovely feeling knowing I’m nearly home. There really is something special about the people around here and once again I’ve had the privilege to meet some inspiring residents doing great things in their community.\nThe Great Get Together\nThe event took place at Constable Street Community Allotments with Friends of Constable Street Fields and it’s safe to say everyone had a great time. The weather was hot, but we had plenty of shade under the gazebos and a beautiful tree. The Humberside Fire and rescue turned up with an engine then got a callout, but thankfully it wasn’t serious and they returned later, so all the children who wanted to climb into the seats look at the equipment and try on a fire-fighters helmet got their chance.\nWe had great entertainment from the musicians who came to play, The Snake Oil Charmers and The Cox Brothers – it was like our own mini-Glastonbury – so a massive thanks to them. The Tigers Trust were running footballing sessions on the field next door, Butterfly City had brought seeds, pots and soil for children to grow their own butterfly-friendly plants and Hull Food Partnership were there giving advice on eating and growing healthy food.\nThanks to MS3 for helping to support the event with free food and bug-hunting kits for children to discover all the little creatures thriving in the allotments. Thanks to the “no-dig” and organic approach to growing, there were plenty to find. Butterfly City also recorded five different species of butterfly and one day-flying moth. It was a lovely day and a fitting tribute to Jo Cox, in whose memory this annual event honours.\nSupport for the victims of war in Ukraine\nThe war in Ukraine is still going on, and the people there still need support, especially in the areas affected by the appalling destruction of the Kakhovka hydroelectric dam by Russian troops, which has left 200,000 without drinking water.\nI visited the new Hull4Ukraine donations hub last month Whitefriargate, Hull. It was lovely to meet the volunteers down there who are doing an amazing job collecting items to send. They still need more items such as sleeping bags, personal hygiene products, basic medicines as well as clothing so please donate at the hub or online using https://hull4ukraine.org/ Any help will really go a long way.\nP.A.U.L. for Brain Recovery\nSir Chris Bryant was in Hull last month for a Labour Party event. He is a passionate campaigner for better treatment of Acquired Brain Injury (ABI) and had a big hand in persuading the Department of Health and Social Care to produce a strategy which is now awaiting publication, so I took the opportunity to introduce him to the incredible people at P.A.U.L. for Brain Recovery.\nP.A.U.L. for Brain Recovery are a Hull-based charity that provides support for people with ABI, along with their families, on all aspects of rehabilitation and adjustment. Sir Chris was just as impressed as I am with the all-round support they provide, and the structured way it is done. Their services are much sought after, and I am helping them seek further support to help more people in the East Riding and South Bank.\nSATS and assessment\nI know from my time as a primary teacher and from the many conversations I’ve had with parents since, just how stressful the SATS and the regime of continuous testing it encourages can be for children. I’ve been working with the All-Party Parliamentary Group for schools, learning and assessment, gathering evidence on the effectiveness of SATS in making judgments on a school and on the quality of the education a child is receiving.\nThe problem seems to be that if you are going to decide the success or failure of a school on an all-or-nothing set of exams, then it is impossible to avoid the problems of schools concentrating on “teaching-to-the-test” and trying to get children to score as high as possible. This can only come at the expense of broader learning and a more relaxed experience. At a time where more children appear to be suffering with anxiety and other mental health issues, and schools are struggling to retain staff, another way is needed.\nTo that end, the inquiry has also been hearing evidence on ways of assessing what children have learned and understand in ways that can provide the information we need to be sure our children are getting the education they need, but without the added stress for them and their schools. The APPG will be publishing its Report soon.\nKingston upon Hull West and Haltemprice Borough\nLast month I was able to announce being chosen as the Labour candidate for a new constituency based around the old one of Kingston upon Hull West and Hessle. The new boundaries have now been officially announced along with its new name: the constituency of Kingston upon Hull West and Haltemprice Borough.\nI think it’s worth repeating that if you live in any of the new wards, and you’d like to get to know more about helping with campaigning, then please drop me a message and I’ll get in touch. Similarly, if you know anyone in the new wards who might be interested in receiving this newsletter, please let them know.\nI have already had an ex-pupil get in touch and offer to help, which is amazing – although their age took me by surprise a bit – how time flies!\nOnce again, until the next General Election I remain the MP for the original constituency of Hull West and Hessle and I will carry on working my hardest to give everyone the best representation I can.\nAnd finally,\nAs always, please feel free to share this letter with anyone you think might be interested. I will be doing as much as I can to offer assistance and advice over the coming months and represent the constituency in Parliament; please do not hesitate to contact me if you think I can help.",

I’m anticipating that there will be a statement by the Department for Education on the Timpson Review on exclusions from schools. This is something I have done a lot of work on since I became an MP and it is fair to say that the review does not go far enough. At time of writing, I have yet to decide exactly which aspect of the review to ask about but I will be bobbing in the House of Commons Chamber to ask a question of the Minister.\nFollowing this, I will be meeting with the Justice Minister, Edward Argar to discuss rates of solitary confinement in Young Offenders Institutions. Young Offenders Institutions (YOIs) must balance punishing a child for committing a crime with the need for rehabilitation and assisting the child to become a productive member of society who will not offend again on release. The use of segregation in YOIs, in a similar manner to those used in adult prisons, does not create the right balance between these goals.\nWednesday\nOn Wednesday, I will be attending a meeting of the Education Select Committee to discuss Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND) and the role that local government can play in supporting SEND children. This is the eleventh oral evidence session of the Committee’s inquiry into special educational needs and disabilities. This session is an opportunity for local authorities that were unable to attend the Committee’s earlier session with local authorities to give evidence to the Committee. It will also be an opportunity to ask local authority representatives further questions and for clarification based on oral evidence that the Committee has taken.\nLater in the day, there will be an opposition day debate on TV licences for over 75s. For many over 75s, especially those who are housebound or isolated, television is a vital source of entertainment and it would therefore be wrong for the government to remove free TV licences from these pensioners. I will be intervening in the debate to put this case to the Minister. Following this, I will be meeting with Tobias Ellwood, the Minister for Veterans and Paul Matson from Hull 4 Heroes to discuss the development of a new Veterans Village in Hull. I hope to be able to furnish you with more details from the meeting as soon as I can.\nThursday\nOn Thursday, my meetings will include Elizabeth Nassem, a researcher from Birmingham City University, to discuss punishments used in schools and bullying, Paul Andrews from Smith and Nephew and a visit to the Scope Shop.\nFriday\nMy meetings on Friday include a visit to the new community hub of the Raise the Roof Hull Homelessness Project, the Associated British Ports (ABP) and Matt Jukes, Chief Executive of Hull City Council.",

The audit involves linking data on patients’ conditions and the type of surgery to subsequent hospital treatment and consultations in the NHS. Once those data have been gathered and analysed, they will be published by the Department. The work is expected to be completed by April.\nThe study will provide the most accurate data possible about how many women in England have had mesh implanted, and how many of them have experienced problems after surgery. NHS England estimates over 100,000 women have been operated on using mesh and that complications affect between 3-5% of cases. However some recent studies suggest serious complications occur for one in ten women. The APPG has been calling for this audit in order to better understand the scale of the risks involved for women.\nThe announcement comes ahead of the forthcoming APPG meeting this evening in Parliament, where MPs from all political parties will meet with clinicians to discuss mesh.\nCommenting on the news, Vice Chair of the APPG on Surgical Mesh Implants, Emma Hardy MP said:\n“In my first speech on Mesh in Westminster Hall in October, I urged Ministers to conduct an investigation to fully determine problems related to mesh surgery.\n“I’m delighted that the government has listened to our concerns and has now agreed to undertake this audit to get a better understanding of complications related to mesh surgery. I hope the audit will provide crucial answers about the proportion of women adversely affected by mesh surgery.”\nKath Sansom, Founder of Sling the Mesh said:\n“After two decades of mesh use with poor audit, the Government is finally hearing the voices of women whose lives have changed beyond repair.\n“A survey of 570 women in Sling The Mesh shows a third have suffered mesh slice into their vagina or organs and eight out of ten have pain walking or sitting. Six out of ten have lost partners because of the strain while seven out of ten have lost sex lives. A third have had to give up work because of pain. Not surprisingly six out of ten suffer depression and anxiety.”",

The Prime Minister’s announcement represents the most ambitious yet honest blueprint for government in a generation and will allow the public to track our progress.\nWith that in mind, I am wanted to let you know that the work that is already underway to improve people’s lives in Hull West and Haltemprice.\nOur Plan for Change consists of the following milestones:\n- Higher Living Standards across the country, measured by Real Household Disposable Income per capita. So, working people have more money in their pocket as we deliver the fastest growth in the G7.\n- Rebuilding Britain, with 1.5 million homes over the Parliament and planning decisions made on at least 150 major economic infrastructure projects.\n- Ending hospital backlogs by meeting the NHS standard of 92% of patients waiting fewer than 18 weeks from referral to treatment.\n- Police back on the beat, with 13,000 more officers, PCSOs and special constables in neighbourhood roles and a named officer in every community through our Neighbourhood Policing Guarantee in England and Wales.\n- A best start to life for children with a record proportion of five year-olds starting school ready to learn, allowing teachers to focus on the whole class. That means hitting the Early Years Foundation Standard at age 5/\n- Secure, home-grown energy, with billpayers protected as we deliver Clean Power 2030.\nThese milestones are underpinned by our foundations of sound public finances and secure borders. We will reduce small boat crossings and net migration while restoring order to asylum and immigration systems by ending asylum hotel use and increasing returns. We will also meet our fiscal rules and strengthen national security.\nWhile this Plan for Change sets our course for the next Parliament, we have already made great strides in rebuilding Britain after 14 years of chaos and managed decline under the last government.\nWe have given the NHS the biggest uplift in funding outside of Covid years since 2010 and have started a huge national conversation about the NHS to inform our 10 Year Plan for change and modernisation. We’ve kickstarted the rollout of our specialist neighbourhood police training programme and announced new Respect Orders to give police and councils the powers they need to crack down on repeated anti-social behaviour.\nTough decisions in the Budget stabilised the economy and prevented a return to austerity while protecting working people’s payslips, and we’ve already set out how we’re overhauling planning to get Britain building. The launch of Great British Energy will provide clean, secure and homegrown power. Families will soon be able to access free breakfast clubs at Primary School, and we’ve already set out funding for up to 300 new or expanded nurseries in state primary schools.\nWhen Labour won power, we inherited crumbling public services and an economy in dire straits. We have taken immediate action to steady the course, and are now setting clear goals to galvanise work across government and make local people better off.\nLabour’s Plan for Change sends a clear signal that this government chooses stability, investment and reform over chaos, austerity and decline.\nAs always, if you’re a resident in Hull West and Haltemprice and would like to contact me about this or any other issue then please don’t hesitate to get in touch.",

This treatment was prescribed because it is the most effective treatment for their chronic pain management.

Their everyday activities would be seriously curtailed and simple tasks like sitting or sleeping would become intolerable causing them extreme distress.\nAlthough Intravenous Infusion is not normally funded as a matter of course by either Hull or East Riding Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs), these patients have been receiving this treatment for several years because it has been accepted that they have exceptional clinical circumstances that justify them getting funding.\nAs part of the regular review of this funding these patients, through their specialist Pain Management Consultants, have had to provide a supporting management plan to the Individual Funding Request Panel explaining why their exceptional clinical circumstances merits them receiving funding to carry on with the Intravenous Infusion.\nShortly before Christmas, the CCGs informed these patients that the Funding Request Panel has found that there is now a lack of clinical evidence to support the use of this treatment and it will be immediately adjusted and withdrawn over the next twelve months.\nEmma is extremely concerned about why so many patients are now having this treatment withdrawn and the repercussions it will inevitably have on their quality of life. She has previously questioned the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care on the issue and has written directly to both Hull and East Riding CCGs as well as NHS England.\nCommenting on the cuts to treatment, Emma said: “So far 10 people have come to see me about this same issue. They see their future as a life of severe and constant pain with no light at the end of the tunnel, many have told me they would see no point in continuing to live and the reason why is because they have received letters from either Hull or East Riding CCG informing them that their pain infusion treatment is being cut and then cancelled.\n“We all know why this treatment is being removed, it’s nothing to do with NICE guidelines and it’s everything to do with the NHS having to ration treatment because of cuts. The cuts to the NHS shouldn’t be counted in terms of budgets but in lives destroyed. Today I called on the Prime Minister to show some compassion and commit today to both urgently providing Hull and East Riding CCGs with extra funding, and intervening personally in these cases to prevent my constituents facing a life of pain. I won’t stop pushing this government until she’s done both.”",

It was asked in view of the strikes at FCC Environment. FCC Environment are a multinational corporation, headquartered in Spain, who refuse to pay any worker below management level sick pay as of right.\nFCC Environment carries out public sector contracts across 160 parliamentary constituencies and workers carry out work in a hazardous environment.\nEmma’s intervention comes after three visits to the picket line in Hull. She is also co-ordinating a letter of MPs to send to the directors of FCC Environment.\nWilmington strikers are fighting to share the same rights to paid sick leave as the managers and supervisors in the company they work for. At a recent meeting with FCC, UNISON argued that given the nature of the job, using heavy equipment to deal with contaminated waste in all weather conditions, a sick pay scheme is a ‘safety net’ for when people fall ill.\nUnfortunately the attitude of FCC Managers; who receive sick pay; was that their blue collar employees “should find their own safety net”.\nManagers and supervisors with the same or similar illnesses would have been able to take time off on sick pay to recover.\nWorkers have previously stated that they would be prepared to forego their annual bonuses and other payments to ensure that the company is able to pay for sick pay for them.\nCommenting, Emma said “Sick pay is a basic right for employees and a basic duty for employers to pay- it is not something that you can pick and choose, it is part of the cost of employing somebody. This is not just an issue in Hull as the company employs people in 160 different parliamentary constituencies. I am pleased that MPs from across the House seem to agree with me on this particular case. I’ll be sending a letter in the near future to the directors of FCC asking them to pay up that I’m hoping will be signed by members of all parties.\n“But this is part of a wider issue concerning public sector contracts and promoting employment rights. If a firm is in receipt of public contracts then it has a responsibility to live up to a higher standard and our rules of government procurement need to reflect this. That’s why I asked the government minister today to review the rules and make the changes necessary to increase employment rights.”",

This comes at a critical time with concerns over the extra strain this will put on A&E and GPs services in the city during what is expected to be a busy winter period.\nOver recent years, pharmacies have become part of the primary care system, with people encouraged to consult a pharmacist for non-urgent matters as a way of alleviating pressures on GP services. These closures will now mean Hull will lose some of it’s vital primary care services therefore adding additional pressure on already struggling GP practices across the city.\nThere has also been concerns in recent times over shortages of some medication and pharmacy closures only adds to those concerns. The closure of these pharmacies will further limit availability of medication which will be a huge worry for those who are dependent.\nWhile it is currently unknown what the closures mean in term of job security for employees, there will certainly be worries as closures in other parts of the country have seen redundancy and job losses. Many pharmacists across the city have been part of the ‘Save Our Pharmacies’ campaign, something which Hull West and Hessle MP has supported and raised in Parliament.\nSpeaking on the closures Emma Hardy has said: “After 13 years of Tory cuts to our NHS, pharmacies have had to become a vital part of the primary care system and I am deeply concerned about the implications of this on our struggling A&E department and GP surgeries.”\n“I also worry about the impact on resident in West Hull. Pharmacies play a vital role in our community, providing essential services and advice and particularly for those who use a pharmacy regularly, they will be losing a service which has knowledge and understanding of their medical history.”\n“Over the past few years, I have met with several pharmacists in Hull West and Hessle, who have raised concerns about the future of their profession. It is important to support pharmacists and their staff and I will continue to raise these concerns in Parliament as it is essential that residents have adequate access to pharmacy services.”",

With the latest Ofgem price cap increase coming into effect, the Universal Credit uplift coming to an end and inflation increasing to 3.5% – more and more households are going to struggle to stay warm and well.\nThe taxes we pay are the highest since the war but we are getting so little in return, fewer police on the street, growing tax sizes and longest waiting times for hospital treatment, with ambulance waiting times expected to hit 6 hours in parts of the UK this winter.\nThere is a shortage of carers in our area. We need more funding to be allocated to Local Authorities so they can pay carers more – this will help to retain the carers we have whilst attracting new people to the role. On top of this we are facing a mental health crisis with our local mental health services needing more funding to meet the rising demand on their resources. It is unacceptable that people are waiting months to be seen by specialists.\nAfter 11 years in Government, the Conservatives have weakened the foundations of our economy, and have no plan to address the critical challenges we face.\nLabour would tax fairly, spend wisely and get the economy firing on all cylinders.

Now the prime minister thinks that schools can solve the mental health crisis facing our children. The mental health crisis that HER government’s education assessment system helps to fuel!\n“We should not be making our schools learning factories that churn out compliant, unquestioning ‘units for work’, we want our children to be creative, to question, to enquire, to explore and to think independently – especially during this era of ‘fake news’.\n“I am honoured to be a Patron for The Warren in Hull which gives support to marginalised and vulnerable young people and one of the things I would like my legacy to be is that I encouraged and inspired so many other people to get involved, people who were also told their opinions didn’t matter because everyone matters equally.\n“The political choices made by this government to cruelly cut benefits – especially to disabled people, to under invest in education, to under invest in our NHS and to deny our public sector workers a pay rise are making people suffer.

Clauses 7 and 8 allow the government to bring in a statutory debt respite scheme.\nOn this government’s watch, household debt is now higher as a percentage of disposable income than at any time since 2008 and figures show that nearly 4000 families in Hull live in problem debt.\nThe stress of not knowing what demands a letter contains and never being sure if it’s the bailiffs at the door can sour relationships, destroy families and make people ill.\nIn her speech, Emma made three asks of the government:\n- The scheme must be applicable to all relevant debts including central and local government debts.\n- The scheme must make sure that the government’s consultation, while thorough, is as quick as possible.\n- The scheme must make sure that the breathing space is long enough to provide time for families to stabilise their finances and that support is in place to allow them to pay their debts in a manageable way.\nCommenting on the bill, Emma said “We must get this bill right. To not do so would not be in the interests of our economy which already struggles with high levels of personal debt. It would not be in the interests of the creditors, because statistics from Scotland show they collect more of what is owed to them when a payment plan is followed. And it would definitely, definitely not be in the interests of the many families in my constituency of Hull West and Hessle who are drowning in an ocean of personal debt. The government finds itself in the rare position of enjoying cross party support and with the rare opportunity to make my constituents’ lives a little easier. On their behalf, I ask the Secretary of State to act quickly and take the opportunity to help them.”",

The so-called ‘youthquake’, by some estimates, saw the highest number of those aged 18-24 voting in 25 years, with reports suggesting that turnout among young adults was around 60%. Even if these figures have been criticised as exaggeration by some critics, there is no denying that voter turnout among younger generations increased significantly in last year’s general election.\nAnd what an impact it had! Despite Labour remaining in opposition, Theresa May and the Conservative Party threw their majority away in favour of a hung parliament, barely managing to cling onto power. All this has showed us what young voters are capable of achieving. And yet, when it comes to local and European elections, youth turnout can be lower than 20%. According to the electoral commission, nearly half of 18-34-year-olds said that they did not have enough information to vote. This reflects the general apathy that the whole country feels – only a third of the UK bother to vote in local elections at all.\nThis seems bizarre, given the brutal cuts to local government funding seen under the Conservatives. Especially in cities like Hull, ensuring that people vote in local elections is vital. In this city, 1 in every 3 pounds has been lost to cuts since 2010. This has a hugely negative impact on the lives of residents, with Hull City Council forced to cut funding to the much-needed Children and Young Person’s Services and Adult Social Care services. Cuts of £37.2 million to the Children and Young Person’s Service have made the lived of the 20,000 children in Hull who live below the poverty line even harder.\nAnd it’s not just children’s services that are feeling the pressure. Spending on help for vulnerable people with physical and mental disabilities in 2016/17 was down almost 10 million from the amount spent in 2014/15, with the council looking to save an extra 16 million by 2020. Proposed cuts to spending on Hull’s public health services are estimated at £2.5 million, with cuts being made to drug and alcohol services, weight management services and sexual health advice.\nAnd this isn’t only a local problem. A survey of councils by the Local Government Information Unit thinktank found that three-quarters of councils in England and Wales had little faith in local government finances, and that there was also significant concern from some councils that they would become unable to meet legal requirements to deliver core services. In 2017, a shocking 94% of councils intended to increase council tax to meet costs. At the end of 2017, the Local Government Association said that councils will see their central funding cut by £2.7 billion between 2018/19 and 2019/20. This means that council funding could be halved in the next two years.\nSo, what do all these statistics have to do with local election turnout? These cuts are the result of a government that is detached from reality, who do not recognise how many people depend on vital public services. By starving councils of funding, they are unable to provide these essential services, or forced to scale them back, something which puts the most vulnerable in society at risk. Especially in cities such as Hull, which have significant deprivation, support for local councils is needed more than ever. Local elections give local people the chance to voice their concerns within their community. A meaningful vote for councillors who have your best interests at heart can truly make a world of difference in how councils spend their budgets, allowing local people to ensure that their councils are working in their best interests. Not only that, but local elections give an excellent indication of national politics, meaning that your local vote is heard by politicians, policy makers, and media across the country.\nAnd it is the youth vote that has the power to change things. Large youth turnout forces councils to listen – after all, if you’re the ones who voted them in, they’re likely to act in your best interests. You don’t need to know the ins and outs of Westminster party politics to vote in local elections. You don’t need to know everything about every policy of the party you’re voting for. You just need to know what matters to you, as a member of the local community, and what changes you’d like to see in your local area.\nOn 3rd May, you can show your support for a fairer, more equal society, by casting your vote in the local elections. There’s no need to wait for a general election to make your voice heard.\nBy Isabelle Kennedy\nThe deadline to register to vote in 3rd May elections is 17th April.\nThe deadline to apply for, change, or cancel a postal or proxy vote in 3rd May elections is 5pm, Wednesday 18th April.",

The debate will take place at 0930 in Westminster Hall.\nIn the speech, Emma will welcome Labour’s pledge for a public inquiry and call on the government to follow suit. Emma will also call for the government to take the following actions to address this issue:\n1. Commit to a full retrospective audit of all interventions using mesh to investigate how many people have had problems and to ensure that all complications and mesh removals are accurately recorded.\n2. Commit to ensuring all mesh procedures are properly recorded with mandatory reporting of all complications.\n3. Suspend prolapse and incontinence mesh while the audit is being carried out to ensure that no further damage is done.\n4. Bring forward the NICE guidelines for mesh in stress related urinary incontinence from 2019 to 2018.\n5. The government should produce written guidance to raise awareness of this condition with doctors and members of the public and help build an evidence base to track the use of surgical mesh in future.\nMesh surgery is a medical procedure used to treat incontinence and prolapse in women, often as a result of childbirth. An increasing number of women have reported suffering from complications after mesh surgery including debilitating pain, infection, inflammation, loss of sex life and mobility issues.\nIn conjunction with Sling the Mesh campaign group, the All Party Parliamentary Group has organised a meeting straight after the debate with mesh-injured women, clinicians and MPs to discuss mesh surgery and its risks.\nEmma said: “I’m delighted to have secured a debate on this very important issue. I was first alerted to the issue of mesh complications after a constituent contacted me who had been suffering in silence for years. Since calling for this debate my email inbox has been filling up with emails from men and women across the country telling me their horrific stories after having mesh implanted.\n“Mesh implants have left women in permanent pain, unable to walk, and unable to work. This is an ongoing public health scandal and the Government need to do much more to support those affected. The Government have failed to answer big questions about the extent of this public health scandal, including how many women have been affected and why a product with such terrible risks was allowed into the market in the first place.\n“I hope that the government will take action and heed Labour’s call for a public inquiry into the use of mesh.”",

This year’s People’s Planting Week saw just over 2,000 young buckthorn saplings distributed free to individuals, schools, community and voluntary organisations across the city and beyond.\nThe leaves of the buckthorn are food for the caterpillar of the yellow Brimstone Butterfly, so more buckthorn means more Brimstones.\nThe launch was held at Hull Church’s Resident’s Association where children from Priory Primary School and resident’s decorated pots, sowed seeds and planted buckthorn in the grounds. It was a lovely morning and took me back to what was so rewarding about my days as a primary teacher. The children also took buckthorn back to their school for planting in their grounds.\nThe buckthorn was made available through a network of pick-up points and events across the city, co-ordinated by Rosie Ireson, and were gone within days.\nThe saplings were grown by Mires Beck nursery, a local charity which employs and trains adults with learning disabilities and paid for by Reckitt who also distributed 70 to staff and planted some on site. They have provided a map of where their staff will be planting theirs. As you can see from the map of Brimstone sightings for 2023 from Butterfly Conservation, we are already having an effect and the buckthorn are going in the right places!\nIf you’d like to do more for butterflies in your own space, get in touch with Sean at butterflycityhull@gmail.com\nPPE for protected characteristics bill presentation and debate-\nEarlier this month I met Katy Robinson, a project manager for East Riding of Yorkshire Council, who told me about her campaign to make PPE for people with protected characteristics statutory. She told me about problems women have in getting PPE that fits properly.\nWhen I heard about Katy’s campaign I immediately offered my support and I was able to present a bill and secure a debate in Parliament calling for PPE for people with protected characteristics to statutory.\nFailures during the pandemic highlighted how dangerous ill-fitting PPE can be and as we try to encourage diversity in STEM careers, we must ensure that ill-fitting PPE is not a barrier.\nI want to see this guidance become statutory and will continue to work with Katy to ensure that PPE is not a barrier to accessing work.\nLegacy Funeral Directors-\nThe situation with Legacy Funeral Directors has been truly devastating for all those affected. I want to thank the police for their quick action, diligence and compassion while dealing with this case. I cannot comment too much as the investigation continues.\nI was shocked to learn that the funeral director profession is completely unregulated and there is no system of statutory licensing or inspection in place. Having spoken to government ministers, I called for the process of bringing all funeral directors under a regulatory system. I have been told by the government that this will process will begin in the next few months. I understand that this process will take time and therefore in the meantime, I would like to see all funeral directors encouraged to subject themselves to voluntary regulations by one of the trade bodies.\nIt has been a deeply upsetting time for our area but the community came together to support those affected with a vigil at Hull Minster. It was a deeply moving service, honouring the lost with dignity and respect through lighting candles. It was an emotional event and I hope it offered comfort to those who attended.\nCommunity Champion Award-\nVoting is now open for my Community Champion Award!\nThe last few years have been challenging for many people with the pandemic and now the cost of living crisis.\nThrough the most difficult times there has been a beacon of hope; the wonderful people and organisations that volunteer to support their community.\nI, and I’m sure many others, want to give back to those who generously give their time to ensuring people in our communities are looked after. That’s why I’ve created the Emma Hardy Community Champion Award to recognise those who do so much for others.\nPlease complete the voting form linked below to vote for an individual and/or an organisation based in Hull West and Haltemprice you think deserves recognition!\nSave Pickering Park Pool-\nI was extremely disappointed to hear that Hull City Council will not open Pickering Park pool over the summer due to repairs which need making.\nDuring the midst of a cost of living crisis, the pool is a fantastic, free resource, which many families across Hull West and Hessle enjoy. I know it will be hugely missed by those who use it. Hull City Council have also announced that they will take the summer to run a consultation on the future of the pool. I fear that this will be used as a way to justify a permanent closure of the pool.\nI have written to Hull City Council expressing my disappointment over it’s closure and asking for full transparency over their decision to close it this summer and future plans for the pool.\nI have also started a petition to save the pool. You can sign it here- https://forms.gle/Kskz2QtAbdTRXEcZ7\nPrivate Parking Regulations Bill-\nAll too often I’m hearing from constituents who are receiving threatening letters after submitting appeals to parking fines from private car parks. It highlighted to me the urgent need for regulation in this space.\nThe Government attempted to introduce a code of practice which the parking companies immediately attacked through the courts two years ago. The government withdrew the code, held a call for evidence and we’ve heard nothing since.\nThis is why I presented a bill to Parliament calling for regulation of private car parking companies to ensure a better consumer experience.\nTelegraph Poles meeting and bill presentation-\nEarlier this week I attended a ‘roundtable’ event hosted by Minister Julia Lopez, as well as other local MPs, Dame Diana Johnson and Graham Stuart. The event included a robust discussion on how current legislation, policy and Ofcom guidance is impacting on not only Hull West and Hessle, but the entire city of Hull and surrounding areas. The realities of the situation were made clear to Minister Lopez and I explained that in the area, alternative providers to KCOM are effectively racing to install infrastructure in a bid to quickly offer services alternate to the ones offered by KCOM.\nFollowing the meeting, I was happy to sign a letter organised by Graham Stuart MP, reiterating the concerns raised in the meeting to the minister and setting out a number of asks, including;\n- asking the minister to direct Ofcom to bring forward its review of the ‘Hull Area Wholesale Fixed Telecoms Market Review 2021-26’ to now, with a view to setting out when Ofcom can act should broadband providers fail to share already existing infrastructure, and\n- ending Permitted Development Rights for telegraph poles where infrastructure exists, either overhead or underground, and\n- expedite the assessment of creosote and whether it is safe to use (in this case, on telegraph poles) in residential areas, based on current evidence.\nI have also presented a Private Members’ bill to the government entitled ‘Telecommunications Infrastructure (Requirement to Share Apparatus) Bill’. The bill calls for:\n”Bill to require providers of electronic communications networks to grant access to their apparatus to other such providers in certain circumstances; to prohibit the installation of new electronic communications apparatus where services can be provided by sharing apparatus; and for connected purposes.\nI know that this issue is a source of concern and frustration for so many and I’d like to take this opportunity to remind you that I fully share your concerns. Please be assured that I will continue to speak up on your behalf at any given opportunity and will do everything I can to push for change that will make infrastructure sharing a legal requirement.\nBest wishes,\nEmma",

Emma has been a key figure in trying to improve local NHS services and successfully got the CAMHS Inspire unit opened in January, providing key child and adolescent mental health services to young people across the region.\nSome of Emma’s successes in Parliament include getting the A63 Major Improvement Scheme approved by the government, this scheme will have a transformative effect on Hull’s traffic infrastructure and ease congestion. Also alongside the A63 is the completion of the Princes Key Bridge, further improving pedestrian access and safety across the A63.\nEmma has long campaigned for investment in Hull that will boost employment and the future sustainability of the city, including becoming a spoke person for the Lagoon Hull project, which plans to rejuvenate the entire area with a £1.5bn project making Hull a key city across Europe\nEmma Hardy said:\n“It has been the greatest pleasure serving the wonderful people of Hull West and Hessle during the last three years. I have always worked hard in making our lives just a little better and rest assured I shall keep working hard for everyone in Hull West & Hessle. I feel privileged to represent you all in parliament and look forward to doing so moving forward.

  "https_www_emmahardy_org_uk_/https_www_emmahardy_org_uk_2018_03_26_emma-hardy-mp-complicated-benefits-process-is-attack-on-disabled-people/content_338.html": "Emma Hardy, the MP for Hull West and Hessle, has slammed the government for making the application process too complicated and called it an attack on disabled people.\nSpeaking in the House of Commons during questions to the Work and Pensions Secretary, Emma raised concerns expressed to her by a number of constituents about the difficulty of the application process for the Personal Independence Payment (PIP) and Employment and Support Allowance (ESA).\nThe application forms are lengthy and often very difficult to understand, especially without expert support offered by an organisation like Citizens Advice or Welfare Rights, and the assessments in each can be extremely stressful to applicants.\nThis is especially concerning considering that such benefits are exclusively applied for by individuals that are experiencing varying degrees of physical or mental ill-health and in some cases, both.\nThere is also a significant overlap of information between ESA and PIP applications and, while not every claimant will be entitled to both benefits, significant numbers will be.\nTo save them the stress of completing two incomprehensible forms and going through a highly stressful application process twice, Emma has called on the government to make the forms easier to understand and allow claimants to be considered for both benefits from the same application form.\nEmployment and Support Allowance (ESA) is for people who have an illness, health condition or disability that makes it difficult or impossible to work. There are 2 types of ESA – called ‘contribution-based’ and ‘income-related’. You can be eligible for either, or both at the same time.\nPersonal Independence Payment (PIP) is extra money to help you with everyday life if you’ve an illness, disability or mental health condition. You can get it on top of Employment and Support Allowance or other benefits. Your income, savings, and whether you’re working or not don’t affect your eligibility.\nThe latest available figures show that the number of PIP claimants in Hull West and Hessle is 2920 while the number of ESA claimants is 5560.\nCommenting after the question, Emma said “Applying for PIP and ESA is an exceptionally difficult and stressful thing to do, undertaken almost exclusively by those who are among the most vulnerable in our society. The fact that the forms for both benefits are exceptionally complicated, that expert help is not always available and that the assessment process following a claim is unduly stressful only add to the hardship for disabled people. It is almost as if this government wants to make claims unnecessarily complicated and difficult to process.\n“The Labour Party invented the welfare system to look after those with genuine need but, under this Conservative government, the system attacks disabled people and is not fit for purpose. I asked the Minister today to look at how the application form can be made simpler and how changes can be made to make sure that the large number of claimants who are eligible for both ESA and PIP don’t have to go through the same process twice. I will continue to press the government to make sure these changes are made and disabled people are put back at the centre of our welfare system.”",

The allowance for a 1 bedroom or shared accommodation in Hull is £69.73, almost a third of the Local Housing Allowance in Central London. Labour had pressed the government to drop these plans.\nAt Prime Ministers Questions, it was announced that the Government would follow Labour’s plans and drop the Local Housing Allowance cap. The Government will make an announcement on how it will fund supported housing going forward. Emma will follow the announcements closely and push the government to make sure they get the funding formula right.\nSpeaking in the House of Commons, Emma said: “During conference recess I held a series of events in my constituency called the Big conversation and I was pleased to visit an open day on supported housing at the Salvation Army Hostel in Hull called William Booth House. There were also representatives from Emmaus, the Hull Resettlement Project and other local providers.\n“The message I kept hearing from each and every supported housing organisation I spoke to is that the uncertainty over the future of supported housing funding is extremely worrying and that if the government gets the funding formula wrong, it could mean that every organisation in Hull would be at risk of closure.\n“Although it’s great that the Prime Minister is giving into Labour Party pressure and abandoning the Government’s plans to cap housing benefit at Local Housing Allowance level, the Devil will be in the detail and I will be pushing the Government to make sure they get it right.”",

I’m so pleased to have been elected as the first MP for the constituency of Kingston upon Hull West and Haltemprice, to give it it’s full name. It is truly an honour and a privilege, and I am looking forward to representing everyone with the same energy and commitment I gave to the old constituency. I’d like to thank everyone who supported me. I have had many messages of congratulations, and they mean a great deal to me. All I have ever wanted is to do the best job I can for you all. As a subscriber to this newsletter, you know I fight for everyone in the constituency without fear or favour. Community Awards I managed to finish presenting my Community Awards before voting day. The Community Champion Award went to Dawn North for the amazing work she does with her team at Connect Community Church in Gipsyville. There they provide a fantastic play group for local families. There are games, crafts, singing and I have to say, as an ex-teacher I was so impressed by how calm and relaxed it all is. It’s such a welcoming and supportive atmosphere. It costs £1 for the whole family, and unsurprisingly there’s a waiting list. |\n|\n|\n|\nArmed Forces Day I also got to visit the event in Victoria Square for Armed Forces Day. Their service is invaluable and I’m so pleased that the new Labour government is committed to strengthening support for our Armed Forces communities by putting the Armed Forces Covenant fully into law and establishing an independent Armed Forces Commissioner to improve service life. Support after service is just as important, and Labour is committed to ensuring veterans have access to the mental health, employment, and housing they need. |\n|\n|\n|\nIn government with new challenges For the first time I am a part of a Labour government. It is both exciting and daunting. We understand we have been given the job of restoring trust in politicians to put the needs of the country before party, and to rebuild so much that has been lost. It is a huge task, but one we are determined to meet. I have been encouraged by how quickly Keir has appointed his team and the way he has set about this task. I hope it is clear that the Labour Party has not been sat on its hands in opposition but has been making preparations should it win the general election, whenever that was called. That was certainly what I saw as a part of the shadow Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) team. I’m delighted to be able to say the Prime Minister has appointed me as a Parliamentary Under Secretary in DEFRA as Minister for Water. I’m excited to be at the beating heart of a Labour government ready to make changes to improve the lives of people right across the UK. Wish me luck! |\n|\n|\n|\nSupporting the constituency Now I’m an MP again it’s back to my usual email address and office phone number if you need to get in touch. Email: emma.hardy.mp@parliament.uk Office phone: 01482 219211 I will be holding my first constituency surgeries on Friday and continue supporting constituents in the same way I have for the last seven years.

This vital document ensures that employees with endometriosis receive the recognition, understanding, and flexibility they need to continue working while managing their condition. The Charter has been signed off by trade unions and is now ready for implementation.\nOne of the most important aspects of this initiative is that the Charter is completely free of charge.

Flats in Hull West and Hessle do not have panels made from ACM, but Hull City Council, rightly, feel it is important to test all cladding panels to demonstrate they are safe and to ensure that residents feel reassured.\nEmma Hardy MP said:\n“The Council are taking positive steps to test the panels on their high-rise flats, but this will come at considerable expense and is bound to impact on the spending capacity in other areas of council activity.\nBy refusing to confirm they will fund the testing of all cladding panels in high-rise flats, the Conservatives are yet again showing disregard for the concerns of residents and are ignoring the funding pressures they have inflicted upon Hull City Council.”\nNote: The two written questions are:\nTo ask the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, if he will provide funding to councils to test for fire safety of the cladding on high rise flats which do not have aluminium composite material.\nTo ask the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, whether his department plans to provide funding required by (a) Hull City Council and (b) other councils to carry out fire safety tests on cladding for high-rise flats other than those which have aluminium composite material panels.",

This will be the third consecutive time I have held these events across our constituency. Last year I held 19 events across 4 weeks and contacted over 36,000 households.\nThese events are designed with you at the very heart of them; it is you that come along and deliver to me what the driving issues are in your area.\nLast year, because of these events and of what you told me, I have been able to address the government and push for a fairer education system that focuses on individual abilities rather than league tables and exam results. I have been able to campaign on period poverty and menstrual well-being so our children are better able to develop in schools. And I have been able to secure changes to governmental guidance for school uniform, ensuring that it will have less branding and become more affordable for all families.\nThere were many more issues that you asked me to voice in Parliament such as anti-social behaviour and improvements to policing, campaigning for better Mental Health services within schools, and I have been able to support constituents on Universal Credit and direct them to services which can assist them further. These are all ongoing battles that I am having with the government but ones from which I shall not shy away from until I get the results that you deserve.\nFor a comprehensive breakdown of all the action I have taken from last years events click on this link Big Conversation.\nSo, soon enough you shall be receiving my Big Conversation 2019 information through your door and on my social media posts on Facebook and twitter advertising where I shall be and when.\nI truly hope to meet and listen to as many of you as possible, because what matters to you matters to me…and it directs the actions I take in Hull West & Hessle and in Parliament.\nAs ever, do please get in touch if you have any issues or would like updating on any of my actions, and do take care…\nEmma",

I have spoken in the House on this matter and it is one of keen interest to me and my constituents, some of whom brought this event to my attention and asked for me to attend.\nFollowing that, I shall be meeting a representative of the Worth Less? campaign in Portcullis House. Worth Less? have representation across 64 Local Authorities and boroughs and have been focussing on adequate funding for schools, improved teacher supply and retention, and social mobility.

This is a crucial step towards ensuring the security and dignity of the deceased.\nWhile the inquiry was initially commissioned to investigate inappropriate and unlawful actions in the mortuaries at Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust and why they went apparently unnoticed, the phase 2 interim report’s findings resonate deeply with people in Hull and East Yorkshire, in light of the distressing case involving Legacy Independent Funeral Directors which followed the inquiry’s commissioning. It is imperative that we take these lessons to heart and act swiftly to implement robust regulatory measures. Our loved ones deserve the utmost respect in their final arrangements and I will continue to campaign for this essential reform.\nHere are the recommendations from the phase 2 interim report- The Inquiry is unable to investigate these allegations itself and is not able to commentspecifically on matters that are the subject of ongoing criminal investigations. However, we highlight the existence of these allegations in order to emphasise the urgent need for independent statutory regulation in the sector.\nRecommendation 1\n– The UK government should establish an independent statutory regulatory regime for funeral directors in England as a matter of urgency in order to safeguard the security and dignity of the deceased. This regime should include a licensing scheme, mandatory standards against which funeral directors should be inspected regularly, and enforcement powers. The Inquiry would expect to be informed by the government what this statutory regulatory regime will be before publication of the Inquiry’s Final Report.\nRecommendation 2\n– These regulations and standards should be considered within the overall care and journey of the deceased rather than applying in isolation to funeral directors. This will be explored further and commented on by the Inquiry in the Final Report of Phase 2.\nRecommendation 3\n– The standards should include details of mandatory information to be given to customers by funeral directors to provide transparency about the care of the deceased, including information on measures to protect their security and dignity, and what should be expected of funeral directors’ services.\nRecommendation 4\n– Direct cremation businesses should also be considered in this context, and mandatory standards to protect the security and dignity of the deceased should be applied to these businesses and to any emerging new models of delivery of care for the deceased.\nRecommendation 5\n– While the introduction of a proportionate statutory regulation and inspection regime may require significant adjustment by funeral director organisations, it is the view of the Inquiry that the benefit to customers and the need for public confidence outweigh the difficulties that may be experienced by some businesses.\nYou can read the full report here- https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/david-fuller-inquiry-phase-2-interim-report",

They are the beating heart of our communities. They are where we come together.\nWhen shops reopened last week, we were celebrating that we could get back to the places we love, spending time with the people we love.\nBut even before Covid hit, our high streets were suffering.\nHere in Yorkshire and Humber region in the last decade we’ve lost 1,085 shops, 400 pubs and 190 libraries.\nWe can’t turn the clock back on online shopping and we shouldn’t try. But a change in shopping habits shouldn’t mean losing what we all love and value about our high streets.\nWe should be thinking about the high streets of the future. Starting with what local people want and need.\nSadly, this Conservative government is doing the opposite.\nThis summer, they’re changing planning rules so our high streets can be sold off and converted into poky flats. Local communities won’t get a say.\nThey’ve done nothing to help high street stores cope with business rate bills.\nAnd they’re bringing in a tax break for Amazon and other tech giants who already don’t pay enough.\nIt’s typical of the Tories – leaving people behind, letting them sink or swim.\nLabour wants to see a brighter future for our high streets.\nThat means listening to the people that matter: local communities and experts like those on our new Rebuilding Our High Streets Commission.\nIt will bring together experts from retail, leisure and hospitality, as well as the trade union movement, local government, cooperative and social enterprise sectors.\nWe need to act now so our children and grandchildren can still have those places to come together, to spend time with one another and to build those bonds of community that this last year has shown are so important.",

In 2007, Hull was hit by floods causing £40 million worth of damage and many still have vivid memories of the water devastating our city.\nWithin Hull West and Hessle only the wards of Hessle (35%) and Newington and Gipsyville (95%) have less than 98% of their population within flood risk category.\nI firmly believe that we need houses fit for the future. Climate change means that flooding is now inevitable – it is no longer a case of if flooding will happen but when. Without positive action from the government tens of thousands of homes and businesses will be built without the protection they need. This is another housing scandal in the making.\nThere have been some improvements over the years such as the Flood Re scheme but this needs improvement. The Bill I proposed calls for 5 areas of change. Firstly, to set out binding planning requirements for properties, enforced by local authorities. Secondly, to create a scheme, binding on the insurance industry, to recognise when a home has obtained flood prevention measures; and thirdly, to extend the Flood Re scheme further.\nI recently asked the Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities that business and community flood recovery support funding would be a priority. The Secretary of State agreed to meet with me and the relevant minister before the end of February to discuss the Bill and I hope they will reconsider supporting my urgently needed proposals.\nAlongside my Flooding bill, I have also launched an online petition and Parliamentary petition which urge the Government to commit to statutory flood protections.

The move follows concerns raised by parents, with a third still worried about uniform costs, and reports showing that some schools have increased the number of branded items required.\nEmma Hardy, MP for Hull West and Haltemprice, has long campaigned for affordable school uniforms for families and has championed policies to reduce costs nationwide. She also set up Re:Uniform, a scheme dedicated to helping local families access low-cost school clothing.\nCommenting on the new measures, Emma Hardy MP said:\n“I am so pleased to see this issue finally being addressed. For years, I have campaigned in Parliament to reduce the burden of uniform costs on families, because no parent should have to struggle financially just to send their child to school in the right uniform.\nHaving founded Re:Uniform to support families in our local area, I’ve seen firsthand how reducing these costs can make a huge difference. This new law is a significant step forward, and I hope it will bring much-needed relief to parents across Hull West and Haltemprice and beyond.”\nThe uniform cap is part of wider provisions in the Children’s Wellbeing and Schools Bill, which aims to strengthen protections for vulnerable children, introduce free breakfast clubs in schools, and raise school standards across the country.\nWith these latest changes, parents will have greater flexibility to shop for affordable uniforms, ensuring that school costs are no longer a barrier to education and opportunity.",

Each month I try and give an outline of the work I have been doing in parliament and in the constituency so I hope you find it useful, please do feel free to reply with comments on the issues I have raised or suggestions on what I could cover in the future.\nHelp for Hessle Feast\nI had a fabulous time at last year’s Hessle Feast. The sun was shining, and my stall was hosting Butterfly City, where children could decorate their own pots before planting seeds for butterfly foodplants and we were releasing Brimstone butterflies as they emerged from their chrysalides. It was a really well organised, very popular event and it was a pleasure to visit the other stalls, listen to live music and meet constituents.\nI was delighted to hear the funding needed to continue has been found, but now the organisers want your help in making this year’s Hessle Feast the best ever!\nThey are holding an event planning meeting at The Hase pub on Swinegate on Tuesday 7th March at 6pmand would love to see as many business owners, residents and community members there as possible to get your input into how to make this year’s Feast a success, and to help in the planning stages. They are especially keen to hear from anyone who can volunteer to put in a little time, especially on the day itself. More information on their Facebook page here, or email hesslefeastinfo@gmail.com.\nI hope to see you there in the summer!\nMore flooding news\nI know, I know, more flooding! What can I say? This stuff is important! I heard powerful evidence given in the Treasury Select Committee by Matt Hammersmith, CEO of Barclays Bank. Most homeowners think that the value of their property will naturally increase over time but the honest truth is that houses in flood areas will not unless we take necessary action in flood mitigation and protection.\nThe Humber 2100+ project – to protect the people and industries along the Humber, Ouse and Trent into the next century – is progressing slowly. The comparable Thames 2100 project has £178.1 million funding for the next three yearsand a projected budget of £10 billion confirmed as “cost-effective.” There is also £501 million being spent on the Thames upstream of London in Surrey in a separate flood prevention project. At the same time, Humber 2100+ is relying on Defra grants for its funding – £12.1m for the next three years – while £59.6 million has been allocated for flood improvements (majority Defra grants again) with no budget proposed for the long term. This is simply not good enough and I will be looking into how we can get better support from central government to speed things up.\nGood news: I’ve just been shown round some of the sites in Derringham selected for improvement by the Living with Water team to prevent local flooding. I’m particularly pleased that an area I brought to their attention after complaints from residents has been included. More updates as I get them.\nCelebrating the Headscarf Revolutionaries\nIan Cuthbert first wrote to me in November 2021, asking for my support for his campaign to see the Headscarf Revolutionaries recognised with a statue in Hull. I was delighted to help out – it is an amazing story of bravery and determination to make change following appalling tragedy, and it should never be forgotten. Progress is being made, a petition is available to sign here, the FaceBook page is here and you can email headscarfpride@yahoo.com if you want to get involved.\nThere will be a Headscarf Parade in the city centre on Wednesday 8 March 10:15 am to celebrate these daughters of Hull and their remarkable achievement, as well as raise funds towards the statue. It is also, appropriately, International Women’s Day. There is also funky merchandise available to support the campaign on the Clem Wear website here.\nCost of living increases\nI’m really disappointed that with all the other cost-of-living pressures we face, the new Lib Dem council has chosen to raise council taxes by the maximum allowed. Council tax is not a progressive tax in Hull, where two thirds of properties are band A and only 5% are band D and above. I understand things are tight at the council but they must know that this will hit a lot of people hard. They have also raised rents on council properties by 7%. This is too much at this time, and may even end up as an own-goal by bringing in less total revenue as more people are forced into arrears. The council have to deal with the consequences of homelessness, so again they may be increasing costs elsewhere if evictions rise. It will also have a knock-on effect in the private rental sector as landlords will now feel justified in putting up their rents. These are the reasons the Labour-led council had a rent freeze in place – I think it is a poorly thought out decision and I really am concerned about the consequences.\nNHS pressures\nIt is very worrying to hear that Hull Royal infirmary’s waiting times are among the longest in the country. I know the staff there are working as hard as they can. I am concerned about their well being as they are under continual pressure because there are not enough of them, and not enough beds. The inevitable delays this causes makes it almost impossible for them to do the job the way they want to. As you know, I have written to the government about this on numerous occasions and raised it directly with ministers many times on the floor of the House, so I was delighted to see the NHS announced recently by Keir Starmer as one of Labour’s 5 Missions. We need a plan and we need a government committed to taking meaningful action.\nThe five missions are:\n- Secure the highest sustained growth in the G7, with good jobs and productivity growth in every part of the country making everyone, not just a few, better off.\n- Make Britain a clean energy superpower to create jobs, cut bills and boost energy security with zero-carbon electricity by 2030, accelerating to net zero.\n- Build an NHS fit for the future by reforming health and care services to speed up treatment, harnessing life sciences and technology to reduce preventable illness, and cutting health inequalities.\n- Make Britain’s streets safe by reforming the police and justice system, to prevent crime, tackle violence against women, and stop criminals getting away without punishment.\n- Break down the barriers to opportunity at every stage, for every child, by reforming the childcare and education systems, raising standards everywhere, and preparing young people for work and life.\nI believe it is possible is to build a better Britain for everyone, and that these are important commitments towards making that happen. More detail on how Labour will achieve these missions can be found here.\nAnd finally, As always, please feel free to share this letter with anyone you think might be interested. I will be doing as much as I can to offer assistance and advice over the coming months and represent the constituency in Parliament; please do not hesitate to contact me if you think I can help.",

  "https_www_emmahardy_org_uk_/https_www_emmahardy_org_uk_2022_06_09_emma-hardy-mps-newsletter-june-2022/content_236.html": "They say a week is a long time in politics, but the past five years since I was elected MP for Hull West and Hessle have contained what seems like a lifetime of change.\nWhen I first entered Parliament, it was in deadlock, but despite the internal warring I was able to get on with the job I was elected to do. My first tangible success was securing the A63 improvements and the Murdoch Connection, work that many had given up on ever happening. It taught me that perseverance and persuasion could pay off.\nAfter meeting Angie, I started my campaign against the use of Vaginal mesh which eventually resulted in a ban on the procedure and the ground-breaking report First Do No Harm, which exposed the appalling way women were (and continue to be) treated in the health system.\nThen I met Kate who told me all about her struggles with Endometriosis and this has led to me becoming the vice Chair and then joint Chair of the APPG on Endometriosis and leading the campaign in parliament to improve research, treatment and knowledge of the disease.\nMy love of teaching led me to joining the Education Select Committee and the work I am most proud of so far: the report we produced on children with Special Educational Needs and Disabilities. We received hundreds of pieces of evidence which exposed the constant battle parents of SEND children face to get their child the support they need. The system is rationed, piecemeal and in need of real investment and change. This led to my formation of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on SEND and I have remained in regular contact with local groups so I can continue to advocate for them in Parliament.\nA regular complaint from parents was the cost of school uniform and so after talking to my amazing friend Susie we created Re:Uniform, which has now redistributed donated uniform to hundreds of children in HU postcodes. It has expanded to provide coats for winter and shoes and as the cost of living gets worse it’s needed more than ever. At the same time, I supported my friend and colleague Mike Amesbury with his Cost of School Uniform Private Members Bill, which is now law and should be helping to reduce the cost of school uniform from September.\nWe also started Butterfly City, a scheme designed to improve biodiversity here by supporting the Brimstone butterfly population. It has now distributed over 2,500 buckthorn plants free to members of the public and got school pupils involved across the constituency and has led to a further 2,000 buckthorns planted by other conservation groups in the local area. A recent study showed a 60% decline in UK flying insects since 2005, so keeping Butterfly City going is more important than ever.\nIn 2019 Theresa May was swept away by her own MPs to be replaced by Boris Johnson. A difficult election followed, and as the dust settled on the new government the pandemic struck. We saw restrictions on our liberties that we had never seen outside of wartime, elections were cancelled, and we have seen the tragic deaths of 179,000 people from COVID. Parliament became virtual as movement around the country was limited and I resigned as Shadow Universities Minister to give me the time I needed to focus solely on everyone living here in Hull West and Hessle.\nFrom Feb 20th to 19th July 2021, I received over 8,500 communications concerning the pandemic from businesses and charities desperate to keep afloat, people worried about their jobs or excluded from any financial support, the clinically vulnerable needing help with shopping, as well as heart breaking stories from people desperate to see loved ones. The rules and what was available were constantly changing and keeping up with them was difficult for everyone.\nOne of the industries I championed was the coach industry who, because of the way they were classified, got very little support from government. I organised lobbying and meetings with ministers. Our beloved Hull FC was also facing difficulty and I worked with my friend and colleague Karl Turner to get them the help they needed to survive.\nI also set up a laptop donation scheme and worked with the Northern Powerhouse to obtain machines for pupils learning at home in Hull West and Hessle.\nLockdown meant I couldn’t get out and about as usual or do my Big Conversation face to face so I started doing Facebook Live events with experts to help out on a range of topics. We had employment lawyers on worker’s rights, the Federation of Small Businesses on small business support and Dementia UK on access to care-homes amongst others. I also began online surveys of residents so I could take their concerns direct to government, and I am very grateful to everyone who completed them.\nDuring this time, I was asked to join the Treasury Select Committee. This was not an area I was familiar with, but it is one where I have learnt quickly. Being able to scrutinise how our taxes are spent and accounted for is vitally important, as the scandal and scale of unrecovered Covid fraud shows. The regulation of financial services is not one which attracts a lot of attention, but it is one which affects us all in many ways – some small, and some, as the 2008 crash demonstrated, very large indeed.\nWhile we focused on our survival here, the world was changing. 20 years of British Armed Forces in Afghanistan ended in a chaotic withdrawal as the Taliban rapidly regained control of the country. Many Afghans who had been involved in the efforts to build a more free and democratic country were suddenly in desperate fear for their lives. I received an avalanche of calls and emails from constituents desperately worried about the safety of their loved ones and sadly I am still trying to get the support from government many both need and deserve.\nAs Parliament reopened, I began a new campaign for increased flood protection for homes and businesses with a Private Member’s Bill, as well as amendments to other bills passing through Parliament. This is a really important issue and one I continue to work on.\nThe revolutionary change to the way we worked during the pandemic proved that people can work well remotely. I see this as a huge opportunity for Hull and so I have been working with local businesses, Hull University and others to create Work Hull: Work Happy, so that people don’t have to leave the place they love for the job they want. Accepting the role of Chair of the APPG for Apprenticeships is another part of my push to increase job opportunities for the region.\nAfter a decade of austerity, we were already burdened with slow economic growth, stagnating wages and a growing cost-of-living crisis but the invasion of Ukraine by President Putin’s forces has seen the price of gas and oil rocket and added further inflationary pressure.\nMy focus right now is on the cost of living. I’ve started a new campaign with Fair By Design to tackle the Poverty Premium. The PP is when people with the least money pay the most for goods and services. One very current example is people on a pre-payment meters paying more for the same gas and electricity.\nWe cannot know what the next five years will bring: I’ve been your MP under two Prime Ministers, and it looks like another may be on the way before the next General Election, but whatever is happening down there in Westminster and whoever the PM is my focus will not change. I promise that for as long as I am your MP you can rely on me to be on the side of the people of Hull West and Hessle and to campaign on the issues you bring to me.\nThank you for all your support.",

The upshot of this is that Hull College are having to get rid of 231 FTE jobs. This amounts to one in every three jobs at the college.\nEmma has previously questioned Secretary of State for Education, Damian Hinds, on the issue of further education cuts when the Secretary of State appeared in front of the Education Select Committee in April.\nIn answer to Emma’s question, the Minister did not mention the 60% cap but assured Emma that the Further Education Commissioner and her department would continue to work closely with Emma to find the right solution for Hull.\nCommenting after Education Questions, Emma said ‘While I am pleased that the Minister has said that she will work closely with me going forward, I was not happy with the content of her answer. She singly failed to even acknowledge the problem that the cap raises for the college and those who will lose their jobs because of it. Nor did she acknowledge that it is the political choices of her government to cut funding from Further Education that have led directly to the difficult financial circumstances that Hull College finds itself in. Fresh Start funding is also an extremely shady area and one where the light of transparency desperately needs to be shone. I have already submitted a written question asking for clarification on the subject and will continue to press the government until I gain a satisfactory answer.”",

The meeting will be addressed by the student climate activist Greta Thunberg. Greta was responsible for forming the ‘School Strike for Climate’ movement in November 2018 and has been such an inspiration in promoting both youth activism and pressing for world leaders to take action on the disaster of climate change. I am proud to support the Green New Deal put forward by the Labour Party for the UK and want to see Hull, as the Energy Estuary, benefit from this deal. Later in the day, I will be attending an event on Mental Health in schools that is being run by the All- Party Parliamentary Group on Psychology and the launch of the British Sikh report.\nWednesday\nOn Wednesday, I will be attending a meeting of the Education Select Committee. The topic of this week’s meeting will be Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND). This is the tenth oral evidence session of the Committee’s inquiry into special educational needs and disabilities. This session is an opportunity for Members to hear about Ofsted and CQC’s joint inspections of SEND provision, as well as hear about the accountability of the system, through complaints, mediation and tribunals.\nFollowing this, I will be attempting to speak in both the Opposition Day Debate on Local Government and Social Care and the Westminster Hall debate on the work capability assessment in relation to employment support allowance and universal credit.\nIn the former debate, I will be raising issues around adult social care. There is evidence to show that some people are being discharged from hospital without any care provisions being put in place for them. Constituents have also spoken to me about there being no flexibility in the care system with some people being forced to wait until 10am to get out of bed or being required to go to bed extremely early because care companies do not have the capacity to offer flexible care. The answer to this is for the government to provide more money for adult social care and you can send a message to them by voting for Labour candidates in the upcoming local elections on the 2nd May.\nIn the latter debate, I will be raising the issue of the placement of the sites for work capability assessments. The site in Hull is located on Melton Industrial Estate. This site is completely inaccessible by public transport and is therefore extremely difficult for anyone to get to unless they have a car. We have to acknowledge that many of the people going to these assessments are extremely vulnerable and, if we are to subject them to assessments, it is not too much to ask to ensure that the venues of these assessments are reasonably easy to get to.\nLater in the day, I will be hosting a meeting with professors from Bristol University to discuss how the Government’s Progress 8 accountability measure for schools can be adapted to take into account social and demographic factors so that it can provide a more accurate reflection of the progress that a school gives to its pupils.\nFinally, I will be hosting a briefing event between Humberside MPs, local Stakeholders and the Humber Lagoon board to tell us about the Humber Lagoon project. I hope to release more information after the meeting.\nThursday\nOn Thursday, I will return to Hull. My events for the day include the ANZAC Day interfaith service in Hull, Dr Rachel Mathieson of Leeds University to discuss teacher retention and the History Troupe. I will also be shadowing a postie in Hull as they undertake their morning rounds.\nFriday\nOn Friday, I will be meeting with BAE in Brough to discuss the ongoing situation with the site. I will subsequently spend the day in my constituency office meeting with constituents and assisting them with casework.",

Instead I’ll be “paired” with an MP who would be voting for the bill. They then don’t vote, and so the overall result is not affected. But this is an informal arrangement, and it means on the official voting record I will go down as having no vote recorded.\nAs you may know, this Bill will allow Ministers to amend or repeal all legislation carried over from our membership of the European Union – thought to consist of over 2400 pieces of law, and possibly as many as 3,800 – with nearly no parliamentary scrutiny. If the Government does not pass a replacement to any of piece of legislation before the end of next year, it would expire and no longer be law in our country. I am concerned that this puts at risk hard-fought rights and protections for British workers, while diminishing democratic scrutiny and accountability in key areas of British law. Environmental protections also form a substantial part of retained EU law, and the Bill puts some of our most important environmental social protections on a cliff edge.\nI supported amendment 36 to the Bill, which would have required the Government to publish a list of every piece of legislation affected and allowed for parliamentary oversight of this process. It is completely unacceptable that the Government wants the power to potentially allow thousands of pieces of legislation to be removed from our statute book at the end of this year and we have no idea of the exact legislation it would apply to. Unfortunately, this amendment was voted down by Government MPs.\nMore broadly, I am completely opposed to this Bill, which I believe represents a reckless approach to our legislation. The Bill would cause enormous levels of uncertainty as we would have no idea what our laws will consist of in 12 months’ time. I share concerns that the Government is seeking to use this Bill to embark on a process of mass deregulation. The laws at risk are not cumbersome red tape but rights and protections British people rightly expect.\nI voted against the Bill at every opportunity in the House of Commons, and spoke in Parliament on behalf of the many prominent wildlife charities that have voiced their own opposition to the proposals. You can watch my speech here: https://fb.watch/i8TIIX5fAP/\nWe do need to establish the future status of laws carried over from our time in the EU, but I fundamentally disagree with the Government’s approach to doing this, seeking to give itself the power to sweep away key areas of law, of great importance to people across the country, with no scrutiny, no say and no certainty over their replacements.\nInstead, the Government should bring forward a positive set of proposals about where the law needs to change or whether something can be done better, and allow MPs to scrutinise those proposals on behalf of our constituents.",

I’ve really enjoyed being in Hull West and Hessle and speaking to residents about the issues which matter most to them.\nOver the next few weeks I’ll be reflecting on the conversations I’ve had and incorporating the concerns and issues raised with me, into a plan for the upcoming months.\nWithout a doubt, the biggest concern amongst our community was the cost of living, especially with winter approaching. I’ll be looking at ways to support constituents through the winter and calling on the Government to offer support too.\nThere were some brilliant steps forwards in terms of supporting endometriosis sufferers at work during a meeting with local trade union reps and HEY Endo Support. My aim is to make Hull the most endometriosis friendly place to work in the UK.\nI met with Federation of Small Businesses and heard about some of the pressures they are facing at the moment. Small businesses are a vital part of our economy and it is essential they receive the support they need to thrive and grow.\nI held a coffee morning with Ukrainian refugees to hear about how they’ve settle down in Hull and what issues they’re facing as refugees. With the uncertainty of the war, it’s clear that more clarity is needed from Government about how long refugees will be able to stay in the UK. This is something I will be taking directly to the Home Office.\nThe annual plant and seed swap at Anlaby Park Library is always a highlight and it was great to work with Butterfly City, handing our free seeds and plants to encourage people to get their fingers green.\nAs always, I’ve loved meeting with our fantastic local community groups and charities, HU4 Hub, Royal British Legion, Hessle Road Network and Peel Project’s Women’s Group. These groups provide important opportunities for socialising and supporting one another. They’ve also raised key issues which I will be following up on.\nIt was also good to have the opportunity to speak to residents one to one at the surgeries I held in each ward. I hold surgeries weekly so if you live in Hull West and Hessle and want to raise an issue with me then please contact my office to arrange a meeting.\nI’ve met lots of people out at meetings and events but I’ve also put on five Facebook live events with expert panels on housing, SEND, flooding, endometriosis and anti-social behaviour. It was great to give people the opportunity to ask the experts questions directly and give them immediate answers and to discuss relevant issues to such a wide audience.\nTo conclude, it’s been a really interesting two weeks and I’m looking forward to working on the issues that were raised with me. Thank you to all those who were part of meetings, events, surgeries, Facebook lives. All being well, the Big Conversation will be back for 2024!\nEmma.",

I also got to catch up with our young Mayor and Deputy Mayor and it was really great to hear their plans.\nI had the opportunity to spend some time with older residents for a coffee morning at Edinburgh Street Community Centre as well as those young and older at Hessle Road Network.\nMy favourite of course was having stalls at West Park family fair and Pickering Park family fair and getting to do Butterfly City activities with all the children. We learned lots about the importance of caring for caterpillars and all the children were so interested and well behaved.\nA standout moment of the summer must be our Lionesses reaching the World Cup final. I feel so proud of the team, they are all amazing and inspiring women.\nAnd of course, thanks to Councillors Dearing, Petrini and Kennett, Albert Ave Lido is now open! This is going to be so great for the community.\nI’ve had such a wonderful time seeing everyone over the summer but next week I will be returning to parliament and I’m ready to hit the ground running.\nI’ll be carrying on with my campaigns on flooding, endometriosis, financial inclusion, Work Hull Work Happy and of course butterfly city as well as continuing to sit on Treasury Select Committee. I’ll of course keep you all updated with what I’m up to in parliament on my social media.\nOn a final note, I’m pleased to announce that my ‘Big Conversation’ is returning in 2023.

This has meant it is more difficult to renew our road infrastructure and make improvements to its design where necessary and has led to problems like the ones that we have been experiencing on Calvert Lane. Hull City Council has acted swiftly to try to get the much-needed money to redesign Calvert Lane but it was knocked back by this government. The government now needs to step up and put its hand in its pocket to make sure that we have the modern road network we desperately need.”\nAmber Goodwin said “Boothferry’s Labour team spend a lot of time listening to residents and working within our community and this is one of the major issues that they’ve told us about. Calvert Lane desperately needs improving and I’m really glad to have the opportunity to work with Emma on this to bring it to the attention of the government. I look forward to gaining a positive response from them and won’t rest on this issue until we get one.”",

Only by creating growth will we get the economy back on its feet. Instead, Rishi Sunak has decided to repeat the mistakes of the last ten years by squeezing wages and increasing costs for ordinary people.\nNow we know where the extra help for councils is coming from: straight from us. A 5% hike in council tax is on its way. After spending weeks clapping our key workers today the government showed them what they really think. Freezing pay for police officers, firefighters, social workers, prison officers, teachers, probation workers and many other key workers will hit people in their pockets and pull spending out of our high streets and small businesses. It didn’t work last time and it won’t work now. You can’t give our local economy a boost by cutting wages.\nIncredibly, Rishi Sunak said our “economic emergency has just begun.” The people of Hull and Hessle will have trouble believing their ears, we’ve been in an economic emergency for months! What we need is news on support for our hospitality trade, local small businesses, all those people facing unemployment, those people excluded from support and the council to have the money they have spent on COVID replaced.\nPeople are right to be concerned about the cost of the COVID pandemic which is why they have the right to total transparency round the criteria on which Conservative donors gained multi million pound contracts. This is starting to appear like if you’re a friend of the government you will get a blank check, if you’re a frontline worker – you’re picking up the bill. The hundreds of millions of pounds spent on PPE that is not fit for purpose as well as the multiple conflicts of interest are hard to refute. Too much money has been wasted.\nThe Conservatives are very good at making big promises but not so good at delivering on them; I am still waiting for Norther Powerhouse Rail which was announced six years ago, so I remain sceptical about the new regional fund they have announced and what criteria will be used to award it.\nThe UK is facing its biggest economic downturn for a century and a crisis in jobs but this government has no answers. It has missed a huge opportunity to commit to making our country the best to grow up in and the best to grow old in. Instead, it has set us up to pay the price for its failures.",

At a time when they’re working to support the National effort, they face a funding crisis, and the universities minister should be giving them her full support.\nEducation has been underfunded for a decade so if the Minister really wants to promote social mobility she must tackle the barriers to learning which include deep rooted poverty and disadvantage.\nThe Minister needs to recognise that every student is an individual with aspirations and abilities. Supporting universities to provide a rich and varied offer with a focus on excellence that enables students to reach their potential must be a priority.”\nENDS\nExtracts taken from BBC News, full article can be viewed here.",

The topic of my question will concern the location of Assessment Centres for Universal Credit. Whatever your opinion of Universal Credit, we can all agree that anyone who I asked to go for an assessment at one of their centres should not lose out on the benefit because they physically could not make it to the assessment centre. I have had a number of constituents contact me to let me know that they have had issues accessing the assessment centres because they are unable to reach the location. This is completely unfair and I will be asking the Secretary of State to review the accessibility of these centres.\nI will also be holding a catch up meeting with Endometriosis UK, we have secured the date for the hand in of the petition for menstrual wellbeing to be taught in school. This will happen on the 5th March 2019.\nTuesday\nOn Tuesday, the Education Select Committee will be holding a further session into Special Educational Needs and Disabilities and, in particular in this session, how cash strapped local authorities are struggling to meet their statutory duties to children with Special Educational Needs and Disabilities.\nLater in the day, I will be chairing a meeting between MPs and the National Education Union (NEU) where we will discuss their campaign against school cuts. Nationwide, schools have lost £3 billion in funding since 2010 and Hull has been particularly badly affected by schools cuts as we have a £5 million deficit in our high needs education budget and each school in Hull West and Hessle has lost an average of just over £130,000.\nI will also be speaking in a debate in support of young carers. Young carers do amazing work and often take responsibilities that stretch well beyond those usually expected of young people their age. Being a carer takes its toll on a young persons education, physical health and emotional wellbeing and I will be calling on the government to do more to support them to live normal childhoods.\nWednesday\nOn Wednesday, I will be meeting with the Worth Less campaign to discuss how to promote better funding for schools, improving teacher retention and boosting social mobility. Later in the day, I will be speaking in a debate on Alternative Provision in Primary Schools.\nThursday\nOn Thursday, Theresa May will be making a statement to the House of Commons about her efforts to renegotiate the EU Withdrawal Agreement. The statement will then be followed by a debate on an amendable motion. We are not yet clear as to what the exact amendments will be at the moment and I envisage releasing a statement closer to the time about how I will be voting on each of them. I would just say, at this moment in time, that Jeremy Corbyn’s letter to the Prime Minister has set out a comprehensive way for her to gain Labour’s support on the agreement, one that is realistic, has been welcomed by the EU and demonstrates the only path currently available to help respect and deliver the result of the referendum. I sincerely hope that the Prime Minister works in a constructive manner with us to make this happen.\nFriday\nOn Friday, I will be chairing a suicide prevention roundtable meeting to hold discussions with key stakeholders about how we can address the increasing number of suicides in our local area. My other meetings for the day will include the Hessle Heritage Centre, the Parent Carer Forum and a visit to the knife angel.",

The appeal, which is asking for people to donate food items and parcels for each day of advent, but in reverse, up to the 15th December.\nThe Reverse Advent Calendar works differently to a traditional one by using the days in late November/December to put items into a box daily ready to take to a local foodbank in time for Christmas week. This means instead of opening something for advent, people are giving something back to the community each day. Depending on when they begin the reverse calendar will decide on how many items are eventually in the box.\nMs Hardy is working with Hull Foodbank, Anlaby and Hessle Foodbank and HU4 Hub foodbank with more drop off points to be announced to ensure the initiative reaches the widest possible audience and that as many donations as possible are collected for what is forecasted to be a very difficult winter for many people in our area.\nEmma Hardy MP said:\n“Food poverty continues to worsen across the country and especially in my constituency of Hull West and Hessle. I’m hearing from some foodbanks in our area that demand has more than doubled just in the past month.\nWith the current cost-of-living crisis, rising heating bills, rising cost of food and fuel for cars, I know everyone’s budgets are at breaking point, that is why I am hoping this appeal will be able to help out those who are struggling the most in my constituency and hopefully spread a little bit of Christmas joy.”\nIf you would like to be a part of this then please can all advent calendar boxes be dropped off at one of the below foodbanks by 15th December.\nThe three foodbanks details are:\n- Hull Foodbank- 28 Paragon Street, HU1 3RJ\nOpen Mon,Wed,Thurs and Friday 11-2pm to drop off\n- HU4 Hub-18 Sibelius Road, Hull, HU4 7NH\nTuesday, Wednesday and Thursday for drop offs\n- Hessle and Anlaby Foodbank- Co-Op Hessle/ Hessle Community Centre\nbetween 9.00 and 3pm Monday to Thursday\nSuggested items to include in a Christmas Food Hamper\nTins\n- Fray Bentos pies\n- Tinned ham\n- Corned beef\n- Stewing steak\n- Soup but multipurpose i.e. condensed/chunky\n- Tinned potatoes\n- Spaghetti hoops\n- Tinned meatballs in sauce\n- Baked beans with sausages\n- Macaroni cheese/veggie ravioli\n- Mild curry\n- Custard\n- Rice pudding\n- Tinned fruit cocktail\nPersonal Care\n- Deodorant\n- Body spray\n- Shower Gel\n- Plasters\n- Bar of soap\n- Flannel\n- Toilet roll\n- Toothpaste\n- Toothbrushes\n- Washing powder\n- Washing up liquid\nDried items/packets\n- Cereal (which can be eaten without milk, such as Frosties or Cheerios)\n- Raisins\n- Instant noodles\n- Instant mash\n- Boil in the bag rice\n- Meat paste for sandwiches\n- Crumble mix / crumble topping\n- Kids baking kits where you just add water/oil\n- Ketchup\n- Brown sauce\n- Jam – no ‘bits’ – raspberry good\n- Chocolate spread\n- Stock cubes\n- Gravy granules\n- Granulated sugar\n- Crisps\n- Golden syrup\nDrinks\n- Instant hot chocolate powder\n- Milkshake powder such as Nesquik\n- Powdered milk\n- UHT milk\n- Tea\n- Instant coffee\n- Squash/cordial\nTreats\n- Ginger biscuits\n- Chocolate digestives\n- Yule log (chocolate log)\n- Bars of chocolate\n- Christmas biscuit selection",

This year the Great Get Together will be built around the theme of welcome: welcoming all to our communities and making new connections.\nYesterday (Sunday 26 June), myself and the Peel Project held a Great Get Together event in Hull on Peel Street Park. It was a beautiful sunny day and I was so pleased to see lots of people come together to celebrate everyone who makes up Hull’s vibrant community.\nThere was a football tournament with local young people and free food and drinks provided. I also had a crafting tent set up where children designed bunting with positive messages (with lots of glitter, of course!). We also heard from local faith and community leaders who all spoke to the #moreincommon message, shared local resources and the importance of community.\nOver the past few years we’ve seen just how valuable community spirit and resilience is – proving that Jo Cox’s #moreincommon message is more powerful and relevant than ever.\nWith conflict globally causing so many families to be displaced, this years’ theme of welcome has struck a chord with many. Hull has historically played an important role in offering sanctuary and this continues today. When the conflict in Ukraine started, it was heart-warming to see the outpouring of support from local people and I know that many have already welcomed Ukrainian families into their homes.\nI always say that Hull is like a village, where everyone knows each other and is happy to help if you need it. The communities in Hull are brilliant and deserve to be celebrated.\nI want to say a huge thank you to the Peel Project for making this event possible, the brilliant local Cllrs for the area Aneesa Akbar and Shane McMurray, and to everyone who attended!",

They brought in a New Patient Premium scheme that didn’t have any impact for new patients, with figures this week revealing that £88 million was wasted on the\nscheme.\nEmma Hardy, MP for Hull West and Haltemprice said: “Everyone in Hull West and Haltemprice knows the scale of the challenge facing NHS dentistry after years of failure under the Tories.\n“In recent years it has become near impossible to get an NHS dental appointment and it is scandalous that the number one reason that five to nine year olds are admitted to hospital is because of tooth decay.\n“Of course it cannot be rebuilt overnight, but I am delighted that this Labour Government is taking such an important step not only repairing NHS dentistry but making it fit for the future.\n“Labour made a promise and is now delivering that promise through our Plan for Change.”\nStephen Kinnock, Minister of State for Care said: “We promised we would end the misery faced by hundreds of thousands of people unable to get urgent dental care. Today we’re starting to deliver on that commitment.\n“NHS dentistry has been left broken after years of neglect with patients left in pain without appointments or queueing around the block just to be seen.\n“Through our Plan for Change, this government will rebuild dentistry – focusing on prevention, retention of NHS dentists and reforming the NHS contract to make NHS work more appealing to dentists and increase capacity for more patients. This will take time but today marks an important step towards getting NHS dentistry back on its feet.”",

The Raise the Rate campaign states there has been a 78% reduction in student support and extra-curricular activities. This will impact most heavily on pupils who need the most support – typically those from disadvantaged backgrounds, and this extra funding would benefit these students the most.\nA topic that has a detrimental affect to our region is the increase in Vehicle Excise Duty on Motor homes by 705% and already there are talks of redundancies as the local industry is expected to take a hit. I spoke on this on Tuesday in Westminster Hall, where I raised my concerns and asked the government to reconsider. Click here to see the clip. I will be following this very closely and updating you when I have more.\nPrior to the election, I was part of an All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Endometriosis and last week it was agreed that the APPG would launch an inquiry into endometriosis early this year. This will be a huge opportunity to hear from the endometriosis community and healthcare practitioners about what challenges women are facing in accessing care and what the Government can further do to support.\nOn Wednesday, the House of Commons considered amendments made to the Government’s EU (Withdrawal Agreement) Bill by the House of Lords. The House of Lords made amendments to the Bill in four areas: citizens’ rights; Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU); devolved legislatures; and unaccompanied child refugees.\nI am particularly disappointed that the Government also removed an amendment by Lord Dubs. The amendment would have reinstated a commitment previously made by the Government to negotiate reciprocal arrangements with the EU to allow unaccompanied child refugees to reunite with their families. The Bill therefore passed all its parliamentary stages unamended. It has now become an Act of Parliament, following Royal Assent on Thursday.\nWhat upsets me the most about these amendments not being passed is that the UK has always been a haven for refugees fleeing situations not of their making and to not allow unaccompanied children to seek refuge in the UK is heart-breaking news. Children so often suffer for the mistakes that we, the adults make.\nOn a lighter note, back in Hull I had the privilege of being on the board of members that will decide the winning name for the new A63 bridge. There have been lots of essays submitted by children across Hull with some wonderful tales, and heartfelt stories, I look forward to this competition progressing and to declaring the winner!\nI have also met with lots of residents at my office and in surgeries across Hull West & Hessle again and if you would like to arrange one please do get in touch: emma.hardy.mp@parliament.uk\nWell that’s it for another week, keep an eye out on my twitter and Facebook for my latest vlog, have a great weekend and see you on the other side!",

The isolation payment is not reaching the people it needs to and statutory sick pay is not enough to support those that have to stay off work due to COVID-19.\nWe know that pubs are not getting enough money to cover their fixed costs, and without support many restaurants and pubs will not reopen again. We are already facing high levels of youth unemployment in Hull. We asked for the armed forces support and were told we’d have to pay. Track and Trace is not working effectively and the amount of money the government have wasted on failed PPE equipment and private contracts is a real slap in the face to all those excluded from support.\nI accept some restrictions are needed to control the spread of the virus and save lives so on this occasion I won’t vote against, but I will not vote for Tier 3 restrictions until Hull and Hessle get the financial support we need. As I’ve said before, we will NOT be the forgotten city.”",

The main order of business for the day is the continuation of the debate on the EU Withdrawal Agreement. As the Parliamentary Private Secretary to Labour’s Brexit team, I will attend the debate but will be unable to speak. I’ll also be attempting to ask a question to the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government about land banking. This is the practice of companies buying up land but refusing to develop it. This is a particular issue in Hull and reduces the supply of housing in the city making it harder for people to get onto the property ladder. Following this, I will be having a phone call with the Children’s Commissioner about internal exclusions in schools. While teachers should definitely be able to remove disruptive children from their classrooms to make sure that they don’t disrupt the learning of others, putting a child into isolation for a lengthy period of time to do menial activities such as copying from a textbook will seriously damage the education of that child. I will be asking the Children’s Commissioner to issue guidance on the proper use of these internal exclusions that schools can follow.\nTuesday\nOn Tuesday, the House of Commons will be voting on Theresa May’s Brexit Deal and Political Declaration concerning the future partnership. I will join other colleagues from all parties in voting down Theresa May’s disastrous deal for the country in line with the wishes of many of my constituents. I will also be trying to ask a question to the Chancellor of the Exchequer to ask him to provide more money for youth services as a method of tackling the anti-social behaviour that has blighted some areas of Hull.\nWednesday\nIt isn’t entirely clear what will happen after the result of the vote on the Withdrawal Agreement is announced. It currently looks like the Government will be defeated but there are any number of scenarios that could play out after Tuesday. It is therefore very difficult to say exactly what I will be doing on Wednesday and Thursday although I expect that I will be in Parliament during that time. I have a phone call with Emma Latimer, the chair of Hull CCG. Among issues I will be raising with her is the issue of headlice and the availability of bug busting kits and guidance on wet combing. Bug busting kits cost the NHS less than £5 each and can be used time and time again, this means they are cheap, efficient and reusable and a good investment for the NHS. I will also be attending meetings of the All Party Parliamentary Group for Mesh and Labour Friends of Local Government.\nThursday\nOn Thursday, I will be asking a question to the Leader of the House of Commons, Andrea Leadsom, about Endometriosis. While I have been campaigning on the issue for a number of months now, it is still vital that awareness is raised. Predictions by the charity Endometriosis UK show that 1 in 10 women in the UK suffers from endometriosis. I will be asking the Leader of the House whether we can have a debate about the topic to raise awareness of these issues. I will spend the rest of the day working on casework issues for my constituents.\nFriday\nOn Friday, my meetings will include a visit to meet with the Yorkshire Brewing Company and Susan Lea, Vice Chancellor of the University of Hull.",

It involved Emma, the police local councillors and Hessle Youth Group.\nTonight’s meeting is the second to be held this week. The first was a very successful meeting with the residents of Great Thornton Street flats, culminating in many residents expressing interest in setting up a residents group. There will be a follow-up letter sent to residents and a follow-up meeting in around two months time.\nThese meetings are taking place on the back of reports of anti-social behaviour across the constituency and aim to bring residents and other stakeholders together to empower them to solve the problems of anti-social behaviour that they currently face. The meeting will also focus on building a community mechanism that can be helpful in solving problems in the future.\nThe meetings are based on an initiative, led by Emma, previously used to address a similar situation in Spring Bank which had seen a variety of anti-social behaviour issues involving drugs and alcohol. By involving local residents and giving them the opportunity to come together with the police and other stakeholders, progress was able to be made on tackling the anti-social behaviour.\nAlongside her work locally, Emma has also been campaigning on this issue nationally. In a speech made on the 13th March, Emma expressed concern around the constantly shifting crime spots in Hull and Hessle. Following the successful earlier effort to solve problems with anti-social behaviour in Spring Bank, issues seem to have migrated to other areas of the constituency. Emma called for a long-term solution including investment in education, community support and investment in the police, particularly in front-line police officers.\n“When I spoke in Parliament last month on anti-social behaviour, I talked about how much of a blight it can be on the lives of those that experience it. Monday’s meeting at Great Thornton Street really brought that home. Home is where you are meant to feel safest but for many that just isn’t the case. I was really pleased with how the meeting went and that I got the chance to listen to people’s stories.\n“While the issues in Hessle may be different on the surface, I am sure that the same approach of bringing residents together and empowering them to tackle their problems will work. This was part of the approach that worked in solving anti-social behaviour problems in Spring Bank last year and I’m sure it can work again here.\n“However, tackling these issues locally is only part of the problem, if we are to stop the merry-go-round of anti-social behaviour moving from one place to the next then we must work on tackling issues on a national level. This means investment in youth services, investment in community support and investment in the police, particularly in frontline police officers. Last year, I stood on a Labour manifesto that promised all three and residents should rest assured that I will continue to push the government to act.”",

As you know I have been working very hard to ensure all our children and young adults get the opportunity to fulfil their potential in my constituency and I will now be able to work with our Shadow Education Secretary to hold the government to account nationally, and this is something I am looking forward to.\nSince I was first elected, I have paid special attention to our children and young adults needs, including sitting on the Education Select Committee where I helped secure agreement from government to cut the cost of school uniforms through reducing branded items. I have also campaigned to have SEND provisions reformed, called for university fees to be scrapped and for a ban on schools use of informal exclusions.\nI will use my new position to push for increased funding for FE and HE, a high focus on quality vocational training and apprenticeships and access and support for children with SEND too. I now have a great opportunity, to help children in Hull and across the country to unlock their full potential by ensuring the government provides the necessary educational resources, funding and infrastructure that our children and young adults require. I will provide the strong opposition our country needs by rigorously scrutinising the policies this Tory government introduce.\nFinally, rest assured I will not neglect or let up on the hard work I do for everyone in Hull West & Hessle and it is because of your support that I can do what I do.\nThank you all for your continued support, and I hope to see you all soon.\nEmma Hardy MP",

She asked the government to follow Labour’s lead and commit to 10,000 more front line police officers. She also asked them to support her campaign for youth provision to be made statutory.\nEmma raised concerns that without these changes problems with crime would just be moved around the city without dealing with the cause of the problems or providing an adequate long term solution. In the speech, Emma described this as ‘fire- fighting without dealing with the cause.’\nThe speech comes in the wake of a number of incidents in different areas in Hull.\nEmma has received several reports of anti- social behaviour in Hessle about groups of youths who are, amongst other things, running in front of buses to make them have to perform emergency stops, damaging property, shouting insults at elderly residents as they race past on bikes.\nIn Great Thornton Street, another inner- city tower block, many are being subjected to hate crime and aggression and are witnessing to drug abuse, violence and even human faeces in the corridor outside their home.\nMeanwhile Bean Street has been plagued by drug taking and anti-social behaviour. On more than one occasion, a nearby park has attracted drinkers and drug users have been seen shooting up in broad daylight.\nEmma’s demands included:\n- A single point of contact and single complaints system where you can go if you want to make a complaint.\n- Taking action to ensure when victims phone 101 the phone is answered quickly.\n- Ensuring that there is better communication with victims about the outcome of their cases.\n- A more powerful victims’ commissioner to make sure that victims can make their voices heard.\nCommenting after the debate, Emma said “For far too long, victims of crime have been left without a voice. By listening to these proposals and acting proactively to prevent crime and promote victims’ rights, the government have a chance to end the merry-go-round of constantly shifting crime hot spots. I’ll be pushing the government to accept these proposals. I am currently arranging residents meetings with the police for both Hessle, Bean Street and Great Thornton Street and I want to support the communities in the same way which I did with Spring Bank, a part of Hull’s city centre, where menacing gangs were previously caught fighting, swearing, urinating, defecating and drinking alcohol on the street. I’ll also be pushing the government to provide more funding to pay for these provisions.”",

We will leave the EU whether we all vote for this bill or not. This bill is not about whether we leave the EU but HOW we leave the EU.\nThis Bill is a power grab by Theresa May’s failing government. She should not be using Brexit to hoard powers in Westminster. No one voted to “take back control” and powers from the EU to just give it all to Theresa May.\nAs a trade unionist I have many deep concerns about the impact this bill could have on workers rights and no matter how many times the Tory David Davis asks us to trust him, I don’t! We all know what they did to Trade Union Rights with awful the Trade Union Bill.

Due to the impact of flu and COVID19 circulating at the same time, this is anything but a typical year and people at high-risk from COVID19 are those most at risk from flu. These include; adults age 65 and older; pregnant women; people with a chronic illness and people with weak immune systems.\nThe flu vaccination programme in Hull and East Riding started in September with GP Practices contacting those patients classed as ‘high-risk’, along with household contacts of people who are shielding from COVID19 and parents and carers of young children, inviting them to make an appointment for their vaccine.\nIn addition, the school immunisation service commenced with public health contacting parents and carers of children in reception and year 7 for consent for their child to have the vaccine in school.\nThis year, 50 to 64 year olds who do not have a health condition are also eligible for the free vaccine. GPs will contact this group of people later in the year, around December, once they have prioritised and vaccinated the high-risk eligible groups.\nDr Anne Jeffreys, local GP and East Riding of Yorkshire Clinical Commissioning Group Chairperson said, “For many people flu can be a mild condition, however, it can easily spread from person to person and for some people, particularly those in the high-risk groups, it can lead to hospital admission and sometimes even death. This year it is more important than ever that people who are eligible for the vaccination receive it so they can protect themselves, their families and friends.\nI would urge anyone in the high-risk eligible group, and those who are household contacts of shielded people, to contact their GP practice if they haven’t already heard from them.”\nDr Dan Roper, Hull Clinical Commissioning Group Chair said, “I want to emphasise that we shouldn’t think ‘it’s just flu’, because for someone with underlying health conditions, people with learning disabilities, pregnant women or the elderly it can be very serious.\n“The vaccine is offered free of charge to vulnerable groups because we know that they need it to stay well during the winter season. This year with COVID19 still circulating, it is more important than ever that people have their vaccination. Research shows that people are more likely to be seriously ill if they get flu and COVID at the same time. Having your vaccination will also help reduce pressure on the NHS and social care staff who may be dealing with coronavirus.”\nJulia Weldon, Director of Public Health at Hull City Council, said, “If you qualify for a flu vaccine I cannot urge you strongly enough to ensure you take it up. Flu is not just a bad cold; it can be a very serious illness particularly in anyone with a vulnerability. We tend to see a lot of information circulating, particularly on social media that the vaccine can give you flu – it is absolutely not true.

More information about NCWCIC can be found here: http://nationalcareersweek.com/\nAmong the several sponsors of the event was Hull University.\nNational Careers Week (NCW) is a celebration of careers guidance and free resources in education across the UK. The aim is to provide a focus for careers guidance activity at an important stage in the academic calendar to help support young people leaving education.\nWith youth unemployment remaining high and employers citing that young people are ill prepared with the basic skills needed for employment, there has never been a bigger need for careers guidance to be promoted and celebrated in education.\nNational Careers Week is the perfect platform to advise and inspire the next generation as they enter the world of work. National Careers Week, which takes place between the 5th and 10th of March, encourages education providers to bring together students, local employers and advisers through careers events and activities.\nNational Careers Week is driven to improve the life chances and social mobility of those that need it most.\nEach day of NCW has a key theme, focus and partner. These are as follows:\n- Monday- RBS\n- Tuesday- Careers at Sea\n- Wednesday- Institute of the Motor Industry\n- Thursday- Milkround\n- Friday- NHS Health Careers\nNational Careers Week are encouraging organisations to make pledges on Twitter using the hashtag. Pledges have included:\n- Running a career focused lesson.\n- Promoting and getting involved with NCW.\n- Arranging to visit a local school, college, training provider or university.\n- Freeing up staff time to get involved in NCW.\n- Giving an insight into a career area.\n- Supporting Careers Events.\n- Career insights and talks.\n- Providing work experience.\nCommenting after the event, Emma said: “Since this Conservative Government took office in 2010, it’s become harder and harder for young people to find stable employment. I was delighted to host this event today and to support National Careers Week. The work that they do is vital in promoting career opportunities and encouraging young people from lower income backgrounds to fulfil their potential. But proper careers education can’t be left just to one week a year and I look forward to working with National Careers Week and Hull’s local schools and businesses in the coming weeks and months to promote opportunity in our city.”",

  "https_www_emmahardy_org_uk_/https_www_emmahardy_org_uk_2020_06_16_full-caravan-adjournment-debate-speech/content_175.html": "I first wrote to the government on the challenges facing the caravan industry in a letter dated 20th May, jointly with my fellow Hull MPs Karl Turner and Dame Diana Johnson and addressed to the prime Minister. In it we asked that caravan dealerships should be opened at the same time as car dealerships and that, in line with the then current guidance for estate agents on house viewings, caravan parks should also be allowed to open for sales and lettings. I am happy to say that those asks were met by Government and I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for heeding the calls from the industry and acting upon them.\nLike businesses across the country, caravan manufacturers have also benefited from the\nGovernment’s economic support measures, including the Job Retention Scheme and the Business Interruption Loan Scheme.\nUnfortunately, all these measures have not been enough to alleviate sufficiently the pressures on the industry and without further intervention the future is stark. The position of the caravan manufacturers sets them apart from others in the manufacturing sector as they are entirely dependent on trade in the leisure and tourism sector, but are not eligible for the extra Government support leisure and tourism enjoys. So I am here before you today to make the case for an industry facing unique challenges and one which plays a pivotal role in the prosperity of a region which is has no capacity to withstand its loss.\nNational Picture\nThe caravan industry is a great British manufacturing success story. The entire sector, including the manufacturers and sellers of static caravans, holiday homes, park lodges, traditional caravans and motorhomes, contributes £9 billion a year to the UK economy and is a growing exporter. Employment within the supply chain stands at 207,580.\nWhen the lock-down came on the 24th of March, 3,361 caravan parks closed along with 381 caravan dealerships. Restrictions on travel were introduced and the public were ordered to stay at home. At a stroke, 2.4 million people were denied use of their caravan, either static or towed. This resulted in the entire caravan manufacturing industry coming to an abrupt halt. Notwithstanding the requirements for effective social distancing and hygiene in workplaces, as no more orders were arriving on the companies’ books 208 caravan manufacturers and 647 suppliers closed.\nThe manufacturers have been working hard ensuring their factories can re-open safely for their workers, respecting the relevant distancing and hygiene guidance. However, the caravan industry is a seasonal business with the prime selling period occurring between March and August. The lock-down could not have come at a worse time – right at the start of this crucial period. The longer the closures have continued, the greater the losses have become. As I speak in mid-June, with possibly the entire season in jeopardy, the prospect of business failures and substantial redundancies looks inevitable without further Government intervention. As the 2020 caravan peak selling period was ended early, there is now an excess of unsold stock in the supply chain. This means whenever the caravan parks do reopen there will be little demand for the production of new units.\nThe independent forecasts for 2020 sales are worse than experienced in the Global Financial Crisis. Compared to 2019 touring caravans face a market decline of 49%; holiday, or static caravans a decline of 56% and motorhomes a decline of 55%.\nThousands of employees are currently furloughed. These will be either made redundant – current estimates are around 40% – or lose their jobs through company failures. The economic and social impact will be directly felt in areas already under tremendous economic pressure and with high levels of deprivation.\nHull\nThe Hull and East Riding caravan industry originally developed in the region in the 1950s, taking advantage of the plentiful imports of timber through the ports of Hull and Goole. Leading companies based in the area now include, Swift, Willerby, ABI,\nAtlas, Delta, Coachman, Europa and Victory. They are responsible for producing over 75% of the country’s static caravans and holiday homes, as well as park lodges, traditional caravans and motorhomes. In addition, the wider industry produces modular homes and relocatable buildings. These companies, and other smaller manufacturers, support many others as part of their supply chain. A typical static caravan requires two and a half thousand parts and require hand-finished by skilled crafts-people. Around 10,000 are employed directly with an estimated 10,000 more in the supply chain.\nPrior to the crisis these companies’ order books were full and at least one of the major manufacturers was planning to expand its facilities. In the medium to long term it is also anticipated demand for static caravans and lodges – based on bulk orders emanating from lodge and caravan parks – as well as demand for touring caravans and camper vans will be significant. It is entirely plausible that in our altered circumstances they will see an increase in demand beyond that anticipated as people prefer to holiday in the UK on sites where social distancing can be achieved. Static and mobile caravan sites are well placed to meet those requirements. The question will be who will meet that demand? Will another once proud British industry be allowed to go to the wall and see demand replaced by imports, with jobs and money flowing out of the country? This is surely not what is meant by the Government’s aspirations to a “Global Britain”?\nVED succees\nThis was the very real danger facing the motorhome industry recently, and one which I was proud to take up the fight for. Changes in Europe-wide legislation on vehicle emissions had led the Treasury to alter UK vehicle emission duty in such a way as to lead to a massive increase in road tax for motorhomes. The UK motorhome industry is healthy, but comprised of small to medium sized companies. The shock of the tax increase on the market would have driven them quickly out of business. However, their European competitors were part of large parent companies with deeper pockets and able to ride out the initial blow. The UK market for motor homes would not have disappeared – it would no doubt have recovered eventually – but the choice of buying British would have disappeared. The jobs would have disappeared along with the revenue to the Exchequer.\nI am happy to say the Government listened to industry on that occasion, the increases were dropped before implementation and there was a huge sigh of relief all round. The key to that success was that Government listened, it recognised and understood the problems and the need for urgent action. Making the changes after a year would have been too late, the damage would have been done. I hope the Government will recognise the same need for urgency in the case of the wider caravan industry – which, let us not forget, includes the recently saved motorhome sector – and will act with the same speed and effectiveness.\nWhy the sector needs special consideration\nAs I said earlier, caravan manufacturers have benefited from the Government’s economic support measures. Most staff are furloughed and they are able to access the Corona Virus Business Interruption Loan Scheme. However, the industry is entirely dependent on trade in the leisure and tourism sector. This sector was rightly identified by the Government at the start of their pandemic response as being uniquely impacted by the requirements of the lock-down, the new rules on social distancing and the initial restrictions on even small gatherings. It introduced extra support for this sector. However, the caravan industry has not been made eligible for this support despite the fact that it is totally reliant on the sector. There are no alternative outlets for its products, there are new markets to expand into.\nIn fact, because of the destruction of its 2020 selling season and the consequent remaining unsold units, even as the restrictions on the leisure sector are eased and caravan parks and camp sites reopen, the caravan manufacturing industry will see very few new orders. As things stand it can only hope to struggle on until winter before economic realities can be no longer be avoided.\n95 percent of all caravans are privately owned; they are self-contained and the generous separation distances between units required by law of 5 to six metres on parks is greater than the spacing of many new detached houses.\nAs such they offer perhaps the safest form of leisure and holiday accommodation now that the restrictions the Covid 19 pandemic has imposed on us look set to be with us for some time. The demand and the opportunities for overseas travel are likely to be reduced. Demand for safe, domestic holidays will increase without doubt. A caravan-based holiday could soon register towards the top of the list of holiday accommodation choices.\nHowever, this demand will not be fully realised until the summer of 2021 at the very least. The government must support our caravan industry now so that the demand, when it comes, can be met by British manufacturers.\nAsks\nHull City Council and the East Riding of Yorkshire Council wrote to the Chancellor on the 5th June asking for clarification on whether the caravan industry is eligible for Business Rates Relief funded by Government. As the fortunes of the industry are tied directly to the holiday and leisure sector it would seem to be wholly reasonable for the Government to extend to them the same facilities. Their position, and also that of the industry, is that granting such access would allow the local authorities to offer significant support and be invaluable in preventing further job losses while retaining the capacity to immediately respond to any eventual upturn in the market.\nI would ask the Minister to urge his colleagues at the Treasury to make these funds available.\nCurrently the furlough scheme is proposed to start to be reduced in August. This coincides with what is normally the latter part of the industries sales season. Existing surplus stock is likely to cover any pick-up in demand before the winter when sales are normally very low and there is no reason to believe this winter will be any different. Therefore, while the rest of the economy might be expecting to show signs of recovery as activity and demand begin to grow, the caravan manufacturers will remain in the doldrums with little or no new work available for their employees.\nI would therefore ask that consideration is given to a flexible, sector-focused approach to ending the furlough scheme, which would allow its extension in the case of the caravan manufacturing industry so that companies are able to retain staff through an extended period of inactivity. This will avoid job losses and enable them to respond quickly to improvements in market conditions when they arrive.\nCan I ask that the Minister impress upon his colleagues at the Treasury the exceptional circumstances of this industry? Circumstances that set them at odds with what may be happening in the economy as a whole.\nAs a way of stimulating demand I would urge the Government to consider mechanisms for the caravan market such as site owners being able to accelerate capital write-down or other Value Added Tax measures.\nI am also hopeful to see the phased reopening of caravan parks as soon as it is safe to do so. The NCC have suggested this begins with facilities for private holiday caravan owners and holiday makers with no on-park facilities like pubs or restaurants. When the wider hospitality restrictions are lifted caravan parks with hospitality and facilities should reopen to private holiday caravan owners and holidaymakers.\nCall to action\nFollowing the 2008 financial crash, three out of every ten caravan manufacturers in Hull closed their doors. This was a body-blow to the city and the surrounding area. Thousands of families were affected and the effects can still be felt. Hull remains one of the most deprived local authority areas in the country on every metric. The last two years have seen the unemployment rate actually rise in Hull. It now faces a round of closures and redundancies that are set to eclipse even the disaster of 2008. If the government’s stated intention is to truly “level up” the country then Hull and those areas that accompany it at the top of these lists – lists which in my opinion are a damning indictment of ten years of Conservative economic policy – must be the places they begin the process.\nThose within the industry assure me that without further intervention from Government the impact of Covid 19 is likely to hit the industry twice as hard as 2008. I cannot bring myself to contemplate the devastation that would bring. It simply cannot be allowed to happen. I would like to remind the Minister that before the pandemic enveloped us this was a healthy and growing industry – and it can be again, so long as it is given the support it needs now. I urge him to recognise its unique circumstances and its vital contribution to some of the most deprived areas in the UK. I ask him to consider the calls for support from the industry and the National Caravan Council, engage with them and take their cause to the Treasury to avoid the destruction of thousands of jobs and the families and communities those jobs support.",

Guidance for the new subject of health education confirms that all pupils – regardless of their gender – will be taught the facts about menstrual wellbeing.\nEmma Cox, CEO of Endometriosis UK said: “Endometriosis UK is incredibly encouraged by the response to the new Health Education curriculum that will make it compulsory to teach menstrual wellbeing in both primary and secondary education. This change will help overcome the taboo and embarrassment around periods, as well as equipping girls with the knowledge of what is and isn’t normal for their menstrual cycle, and in turn the confidence to seek help when it is needed. Importantly, they will also know the correct language to communicate with their parents or medical practitioners.\n“Endometriosis UK is now looking forward to working with the Government to ensure the new curriculum is implemented across the country to empower children, parents and teachers to talk openly about menstrual wellbeing. The education system plays a pivotal role in teaching young women about menstrual wellbeing, and providing an open and safe environment to discuss what to expect from puberty. The Government must get the guidance right so teachers feel empowered to be part of this crucial change in the curriculum so that we begin to break down the barriers facing young women in seeking help for menstrual conditions such as endometriosis”.\nSince the announcement, teachers, school children, and MPs have come forward to welcome the plans.\nAmongst those welcoming the news, Deputy Head Teacher Ewan Laurie from St John’s school in Leatherhead said: “Puberty can be a confusing time for young adults and taboo and lack of practical information can contribute to the ‘mystery’ surrounding topics like menstruation. One of the key barriers facing young women when it comes to their menstrual cycle is not understanding what is and isn’t normal for most, and when and how to seek help. I’m delighted that the Government has now recognised the vital need to teach both boys and girls about menstrual wellbeing in a safe and open environment. At St John’s School, Leatherhead, pupils have been taking part in workshops to discuss the needs of young people and helping to design teaching resources that work for them. We are delighted to be taking part in such projects as we are committed to giving children the education they need to excel in later life.”\n“This exciting change in the curriculum will equip young people with the language and confidence they need to discuss periods more openly and recognise in themselves or others close to them when it might be time to ask for support. Education in this area will help demystify menstruation, empower students and educate teaching staff; ensuring that young women who might be suffering from a condition such as endometriosis have the knowledge and skills to seek help sooner rather than later.”\nEmma Hardy MP, member of the Education Select Committee, who has been campaigning to raise awareness of endometriosis both in Parliament and across her constituency added: “I am pleased that the Government have listened to Endometriosis UK and other campaigners and included menstrual wellbeing in the new Sex and Relationship curriculum. I first became aware of the plight that endometriosis sufferers face when I was visited by my constituent Kate and have been campaigning on the issue ever since. We can all agree that 7 and a half years is too long for anyone to suffer with no diagnosis and the introduction of menstrual wellbeing on the curriculum will undoubtedly help. I look forward to pressing the Government to improve diagnosis and treatment for people suffering with endometriosis”.\nNick Gibb, Minister for School Standards, added:\n“Our new health education curriculum is designed to give young people all the facts they need to live healthy lives – ensuring every pupil learns about menstrual wellbeing is an important part of that.\n“This teaching will build on what pupils learn in science, giving them a well-rounded picture of health – both mental and physical – and encouraging them to discuss these issues with confidence.”",

The latest Government apprenticeship starts figures show there were just 27,000 apprenticeship starts last November, 40% fewer than in 2016. This follows the pattern we have seen since the introduction of the apprenticeship levy in April where take-up by young people and employers is decreasing.\nOn top of this, the scandal around Learndirect- as highlighted by the stinging report from the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee- and the collapse of Carillion have left thousands of apprentices without employment temporarily, and unable to continue their learning.\nLabour has pledged to look at ways to make it easier for our apprentices, including finding a solution to the extortionate travel costs many of them face just getting to work and Emma raised a question in the House of Commons relating to the financial difficulties that apprentices in Hull West and Hessle face.\nIn addition, Labour’s pledge to roll out a National Education Service is based on the principle that people from all backgrounds both young and older have the opportunity to grasp one of the life-changing quality apprenticeships that must be at the heart of our future skills base in the 2020s.\nCommenting after the visits, Emma said “It was a pleasure to meet with the apprentices at both Hull Training and ARCO. When they are done right, apprenticeships are really beneficial to young people as a way of improving life chances and gaining skills and experience and moving into the world of work. National Apprenticeship Week celebrates all that is good about apprenticeships and I’m proud that it was a Labour Government that started it.”\n“But current Conservative Government policies are putting all that is good about apprenticeships at risk. All too often, there is little to no progression from Level 2 apprenticeships to the higher skilled Level 3 and 4 apprenticeships and apprenticeship contracts are used to undercut wages. The take up rate of apprenticeships is also being put at risk with the Government’s apprenticeship levy meaning that only half the number of apprenticeships created since 2016 have been filled. Constituents should rest assured that I will do everything I can to push the government to reverse these trends and return apprenticeships to what we know they can be- real opportunities that can change young people’s lives for the better.”",

Fortunately in Hull we have been spared the worst of it, but it has been horrendous across much of Yorkshire.\nFor myself, I started Monday by doing a keynote speech at the Annual Apprenticeship Conference in Birmingham where I talked about the problems we have with lack of funding for further education, higher education, apprenticeships and skills and argued how the government can improve its performance and provide the services and education our young people need.\nI followed this up by asking how the government is going to implement its new T-Level qualification in rural areas that can not provide the work placements needed to fulfil its criteria. Also on Monday we saw the first of the allegations of bullying by Priti Patel, obviously I don’t know the details but its sufficient to say there should be an investigation as bullying of any kind in the workplace should never be tolerated.\nTuesday was a good day as it saw the launch of the APPG SEND, in which we will look at how we can reform SEND provision within schools. We collected over 300 signatures from Heads of schools in a petition and hand delivered it to 10 Downing Street, hopefully we can get some results for SEND soon.\nWednesday saw me stand up in Parliament again and ask if the Minister would come along and have a meeting about the flooding, discuss Lagoon Hull and the University of Hulls proposal to build a National Flood Resilience Centre in Scunthorpe.\nI have had some good responses from Ministers from across the House and have so far secured 2 meetings to discuss child services and flooding.\nRegardless of the balance of power in Parliament it is paramount that cross party groups and MP’s try to work together to change the mistakes of the past. Obviously the government doesn’t agree with everything I wasn’t, but I shall always try to make headway for the important issues.\nThursday and Friday saw me return to Hull were I have had many meetings including at The Warren with young people to discuss how we can better police our identities online so they don’t end up being used unscrupulously. This is a complex issue but one that needs addressing, especially with young people and vulnerable children being involved.\nI presented an award at the George Orwell Youth Prize to young writers that engage with todays political climate and wrote some fantastic pieces on their viewpoints. It was an honour to attend and see so many talented individuals.\nSo you can see that what I do in parliament links directly to what happens in Hull, I am always trying to get the governments attention to Hull, to see what issues we have and to provide further funding and services that we need.\nI hope you all have a great weekend and I will see you soon.\nEmma x",

Emma raised the case of her constituent Angie who has been referred from Hull to Manchester for treatment and will now have to wait months before receiving treatment. Support and more resources need to be made available while the review goes ahead.\n· Second, the licencing process needs to be looked into for which products are and are not allowed to be placed on the market. If necessary, the current equivalence model needs to be reviewed.\n· Third, the review must look not just at the training given in fitting the surgical mesh but the quality of the mesh itself.\nDuring today’s PMQs, the Prime Minister announced a medical device safety review, which will investigate issues related to the reporting of problems with mesh, primodos and sodium valproate. The review will be undertaken over a period of up to nine months.\nThe Prime Minister cited the surgical mesh scandal as an example where the handling of issues relating to medical devices has been inadequate.\nIn a statement this afternoon, the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care announced the introduction of a prospective registry of mesh procedures for prolapse and incontinence in women.\nThe review will be chaired by Baroness Cumberlege and will concern the following four areas:\n· The balance around the criteria or threshold for a ‘legitimate concern’ in launching a statutory public enquiry.\n· The best way to support patients where that threshold is not met.\n· The best way to represent patient experience.\n· Whether a new entity is needed and how that will interact with existing regulatory bodies.\nMesh surgery is a medical procedure used to treat incontinence and prolapse in women, often as a result of childbirth. An increasing number of women have reported suffering from complications after mesh surgery including debilitating pain, infection, inflammation, loss of sex life and mobility issues.\nIn response to complications related to mesh, New Zealand recently banned its use to treat incontinence and prolapse and Australia has banned mesh for the treatment of prolapse.\nEmma lead a debate on surgical mesh Implants in Westminster Hall on 18th October 2017.\nCommenting on the statement today, Emma said “After months of campaigning and pressure put on the government, I welcome the announcement today that, along with a review, the government will be putting £1.1 million into developing a comprehensive database for vaginal mesh treatment. I was also pleased that the Secretary of State’s indicated, in response to my question, that he will look into the licencing issues surrounding mesh.\n“But while this is definitely good news, we should always remember that there are real people at the centre of this scandal. These women have been injured by surgical mesh and need treatment now. They can’t afford to wait 9 months while this enquiry runs its course and the government needs to make more resources available to support them now. I’ll be continuing to push the government all the way through this review to make sure the interests of the patients are put front and centre.”",

Teacher recruitment and retention rates are extremely low and one in ten young people now has a mental health problem. The curriculum has effectively been narrowed to focus on maths and English at the expense of all other subjects.\n“All the while there is still not enough money available in the education system and lots of schools are losing out. Some of the hardest hit pupils will be those with special educational needs. It is disgraceful that we have reached a point where headteachers need to be writing to the Education Secretary to ask him for more money to fill the deficit that his government’s policies have left in the Hull High Needs Budget. I’m completely on the side of the headteachers and will be pushing the government to end this false economy and stop trying to fund schools on the cheap. Because if you pay cheap, you end up paying twice.”\nNotes for Editors\n- As many as 526 children aged four and under in Hull have been identified as displaying challenging behaviour or SEN.\n- The number of pupils in Hull with EHCPs – a measure of more complex special educational needs and disabilities – rose to 1,226 last year, according to , following a steady increase over the past decade.\n- This equates to 3% of the city’s total school population, higher than the national average of 2.8%.\n- But in Hull, the High Needs Budget is £2.2 million in deficit.\n- In March, the Guardian ran an article that said that Hull schools have reached breaking point after head teachers wrote to the Education Secretary to warn him that they no longer had the resources to properly look after children with SEN.\n- Specialist schools and pupil referral units are all full and mainstream schools are finding it virtually impossible to deal with the influx of children with specialist needs or challenging behaviour.\n- In the letter, the headteachers wrote “Mainstream schools are increasingly having to resort to fixed-term and permanent exclusion to deal with challenging pupils. This is despite the best efforts of dedicated staff in schools. There is a feeling that something has to change or schools will implode.”\n- The Headteachers say that they need a further £5 million to fix the problem and ensure that no child is left behind.\n- More widely, the Government’s national funding formula has seen school budgets decimated leading to higher class sizes and staff redundancies. Secondary Schools in Emma’s constituency of Hull West and Hessle have lost on average £1.46 million in funding since 2015, an average of £476 per pupil. For Primary schools, those figures are £723,022 in funding lost and £139 per pupil.",
  "https_www_emmahardy_org_uk_/https_www_emmahardy_org_uk_2019_03_04_my-week-ahead-week-commencing-4th-march/content_396.html": "Please find below a summary of my activities for the week\nMonday\nOn Monday, I will return to Parliament and will be meeting with Labour’s Brexit team. Following this, I will be hosting the launch of National Careers Week in Parliament. National Careers Week (NCW) is a celebration of careers guidance and free resources in education across the UK. The aim is to provide a focus for careers guidance activity at an important stage in the academic calendar to help support young people leaving education. This is the second year in a row that I have hosted this event and I am always proud to support methods of empowering students with good quality careers guidance, something that has become a lot harder since this government cut the Connexions service since it took office in 2010.\nAfter this, I will be attempting to ask a question in Housing, Communities and Local Government questions about Calvert Lane. Last summer, I, along with our fantastic Boothferry Labour candidate Amber Goodwin, spent time collecting signatures on a petition asking for more funding from central government to improve Calvert Lane. The Council has previously bid for some money under the Transformational Cities Development Fund but were unsuccessful in their attempt. I will be asking the Government to make these funds available so that we can carry out much needed improvements to this road.\nLater in the afternoon, I will be speaking in a debate on cuts to School Funding. Schools are in dire need of more money. When Members of Parliament on both sides of the House are looking at the examples of schools asking teachers to contribute to the purchase of classroom supplies, or cancelled school trips, or ever increasing numbers of teaching assistants being laid off, or SEND needs being inadequately met, or music lessons being cancelled and not believing the government’s line that more money is being put into the system then it shows that something must be wrong. I will be arguing that investing money into our education system now will save us money further down the line and is a worthwhile investment.\nTuesday\nOn Tuesday, the Education Select Committee will be holding a session on Special Educational Needs and Disabilities with the Minister of State for Care, Caroline Dineage. This is the eighth oral evidence session of the Committee’s inquiry into special educational needs and disabilities and is focussed on the implementation of the Children and Families Act 2014 which introduced Education, Health and Care Plans (EHCPs). While there are many positive aspects to the act, I have significant concerns over the ability of children to access EHCPs as it usually requires parents to spend thousands of pounds in order to access these plans. I will be asking the Minister what role her department can play in making care more accessible to children with these plans.\nLater in the day, I will be speaking in a debate on Investment in Regional Transport Infrastructure. Regional Transport Infrastructure is essential to make sure that we have a successful local economy and this is why I have continually championed projects such as bringing forward the introduction of new rolling stock for Hull Trains and completing the works to Castle Street since I have been elected. I will be focussing my contribution to the debate on Tuesday to advocate for better cycling facilities in Hull. This is vital because it has positive environmental benefits and makes it easier for people to get around the city. Hull’s Labour Council has done an awful lot of work to invest in cycling and are deserving of praise because of this but it is also vital that the Government steps up and plays its part through investing in the city to allow us to do more. I will be pushing for them to do just that.\nWednesday\nOn Wednesday, I will be meeting with several headteachers to discuss the use of isolation rooms in schools. This is part of my wider campaign to encourage guidance to be established to make sure that where discipline is exercised in schools, it is done in a fair and just manner. I will also be releasing a letter that I have co-signed with Dr Paul Williams to the Children’s Commissioner on this subject. I will spend the rest of my day working on correspondence from constituents and meeting with Parliamentary colleagues and others.\nThursday\nOn Thursday, my meetings include an event with the Bank of England to discuss inflation, Dove House Hospice and Hull 4 Heroes.\nFriday\nOn Friday, I will be unveiling a plaque to commemorate the author Elsa Gidlow who was born in Hull in 1896. She may well be the most influential lesbian author of the twentieth century (alongside Virginia Woolf and Radclyffe Hall), having published the first volume of lesbian poetry in North America and the first openly lesbian autobiography. She was at the heart of counterculture in the fifties and sixties and has an incredible range of connections to American authors and artists and is someone that is definitely worthy of commemoration. I will also be holding a drop in surgery at the Manor Farm pub on Willerby Road.",

I’ve been back in Westminster after the holidays, and it’s been a busy start to the year with some important work underway. I wanted to share a few key updates about what’s been happening locally and nationally, and how it’s all benefiting our community.\nWater Quality and Special Measures Bill\nAs you may have heard, I’ve been the lead Minister in the Committee Stage of the Water (Special Measures) Bill. This Bill will improve water quality and ensure that water companies are held accountable for cleaning up our rivers, lakes, and seas. It’s meant some long days, but it is an important Bill that will improve water quality and services for everyone and sends a clear message to water bosses: fail to clean up our rivers, lakes and seas, fail to get your bonus. Obstruct investigations into water pollution, end up with a criminal record.\nWater Priority Services Register\nI’d like to highlight Yorkshire Water’s Priority Services Register, which could make a real difference for some people in our community. If you, or someone you know, would struggle if the water supply was interrupted (for example, due to mobility issues, sight or hearing problems, or using home dialysis), you can sign up for this free service. It ensures that if there’s a problem, priority support is given, including emergency water deliveries. You can find more details and sign up here.\nExtra Financial Support for Local Councils\nI’m pleased to share that Hull City Council and the East Riding of Yorkshire Council (ERYC) are receiving much-needed additional government funding to improve services and infrastructure.\n• Hull City Council is receiving an extra £1.375 million for its Start for Life services, which support families from pregnancy to age 2. This funding will go towards family hubs that offer essential support to new parents and children in their early years.\n• Hull City Council has been granted £3,038,293 through the Household Support Scheme to assist families struggling with essentials like food, energy bills, and more. Similarly, East Riding of Yorkshire Council (ERYC) will receive an additional £2,061,832 through the same scheme to support residents facing hardship.\n• Pothole Repair Funds: The condition of our roads is something many of you have raised with me. To tackle the growing problem of potholes, both Hull City Council and East Riding of Yorkshire Council have been allocated significant funding from the government’s Pothole Fund:\no Hull City Council will receive £4,482,000 to fix potholes.\no East Riding of Yorkshire Council will receive £22,015,000.\nThis additional £33.9 million in local funding is just part of our ongoing commitment to support local communities and improve everyday life for our residents.\nPotholes Survey\nI know potholes are a big issue in our area, and I want to make sure the extra money our councils have received goes where it’s most needed. That’s why I’ve set up an online potholes survey to gather your feedback. If you’ve noticed potholes in your area that need fixing, please take a moment to fill out the form so I can pass this information directly to the relevant council. You can submit your feedback here. I’ll make sure the councils take action and keep you updated.\nHomelessness Funding Boost\nThis winter, Hull City Council will benefit from additional government funding to support those sleeping rough. The Labour government is tripling emergency funds for rough sleepers, with an extra £20 million allocated across more than 280 councils to provide emergency accommodation and support. Hull City Council will receive a portion of this funding to help those who need it most, including a focus on vulnerable groups like veterans, care leavers, and victims of domestic abuse. This funding is part of a wider £1 billion package to tackle homelessness and prevent people from falling into it in the first place.\nLocal Business of the Week\nI’ve been overwhelmed by the fantastic local businesses that were nominated for my Small Business Saturday competition, and I’m excited to announce that I’m now introducing a Business of the Week award to continue celebrating our incredible local entrepreneurs.\nThis week’s winner is The Black Cat – Tea & Coffee Room in Hessle. They’ve recently expanded into a larger space and offer a great range of sweet treats, coffee, tea, and meals. It’s a wonderful local spot for breakfast, lunch, or a catch-up with friends. If you’re in the area, I highly recommend paying them a visit!\nA reminder of our winners and runners up from 2024\nFood and Drink\nWinner Cafe Two-O-One\nRunner up The Milk Well\nHair and Beauty\nWinner Von-Rose Hair and Cosmetics\nRunner up Paige Lauren Bridal\nRetail\nWinner Tea & Bisque-it\nRunner up Lila & Mila\nFitness and Wellness\nWinner NKH_Performing Arts\nRunner up Gymophobics Hessle\nServices\nWinner Pink Banana Marketing\nRunner up Andy Winter Plastering Ltd\nNHS Elective Reform and Local Health Services\nSo many of you have raised concerns about accessing NHS treatment and services. Your Labour government is committed to rebuilding the NHS with the launch of its Elective Reform Plan. This ambitious initiative aims to meet the 18-week referral to treatment target by the end of this Parliament, a goal abandoned by the previous government. With 7.5 million people currently on the waiting list, including 85,275 in the North Yorkshire and Humber ICB area, this plan addresses the urgent need for change.\nKey actions include the opening of Community Diagnostic Centres in the evenings and weekends to make tests more accessible, and expanding surgical hubs to protect planned care. The plan also promises the biggest investment in General Practice in years, focusing on restoring the family doctor relationship that improves care standards. These measures are set to provide 2 million extra appointments in 2025, ensuring 40,000 additional appointments each week.\nRenter’s Rights Bill\nIt’s time for real change in the rental market, and the Renter’s Rights Bill is making its way through Parliament. The Bill will end no-fault evictions, limit rent increases to once a year, and restrict how much rent can be demanded upfront. It will also give renters more security, including the ability to request to keep a pet in their home, and extend protections to tenants who face losing their homes due to the death of a relative. These are important steps toward making renting fairer and more secure for millions of people.\nTicket Touting Reform\nI’ve heard from many of you about the frustrations of ticket touting – when tickets for sold-out events appear on resale sites for inflated prices. Labour is now taking action to tackle this issue. We’ve launched a public consultation on introducing stronger protections against ticket touts, including setting a cap on resale prices and improving accountability for ticket resale websites. This is an important step towards ensuring fans are treated fairly.\nBuses and Local Transport\nReliable public transport is crucial for many in our community, and I’m committed to addressing concerns from residents and businesses.\nI’ve been in touch with EYMS regarding the issues with Services 26 and 54. In response to feedback, EYMS has explained that the restructuring of Service 26 aims to improve punctuality by splitting the route at Beverley, and adjustments to the timetable will be made in February 2025. They also acknowledged concerns with Service 54, particularly regarding cancellations, and are working to enhance reliability through investments in data analytics, driver recruitment, and training.\nHaving spoken to businesses and residents around the Marina I have written to Hull City Council to ask that they support local bus companies to fund a service which includes the Marina, similar to what they’ve done with the service to the Deep. The Marina is a huge asset to our city but the lack of public transport and lengthy roadworks means some businesses and residents are struggling. We must do all we can to make this bustling area of our city accessible for all.\nI will continue to monitor the situation and advocate for improvements, ensuring that our local transport services meet the needs of our community. Thank you for your ongoing feedback.\nChildren’s Wellbeing and Schooling Bill\nYou may have recently heard false claims suggesting that Labour MPs, including myself, voted against an inquiry into grooming gangs. I want to set the record straight: these claims are simply not true.\nThe amendment put forward by the Opposition, if passed, would have resulted in the defeat of the entire Children’s Wellbeing and Schools Bill. This would have blocked essential child protection reforms and prevented the bill from being reintroduced due to parliamentary procedure.\nThe Children’s Wellbeing and Schools Bill is a landmark piece of legislation designed to introduce major reforms, including free breakfast clubs for primary school children, more affordable school uniforms, and enhanced child protection measures. These reforms are vital for the wellbeing and safety of our children, and I remain committed to supporting them.\nThe Home Secretary, Yvette Cooper, has ordered an urgent national review of the scale of grooming, intended to be completed in three months, as well providing an extra £10m in funding for councils to run local inquiries and support the victims.\nWe must never forget that at the heart of these horrific crimes are real victims who have to cope with the trauma of what happened to them.\nThank you for your continued support and understanding.\nLegacy Funeral Directors Investigation\nI welcome the news that Humberside Police have submitted evidence to the CPS for the investigation regarding Legacy Funeral Directors. It’s been a long wait for progress for those affected by these horrific crimes, so I’m sure this news will provide relief.\nI want to thank the Humberside Police staff involved in this investigation for their meticulous work.\nMost importantly, I want to pay tribute to those who have been affected. You have shown us all the true meaning of resilience and community in the most difficult circumstances. The fight for justice continues, and I will do all I can to support you.\nAs always, I’m here to support you. If you have any questions, concerns, or ideas about how I can help, please don’t hesitate to get in touch. You can email me at emma.hardy.mp@parliament.uk or call my office at 01482 219211. Leave a message if I’m unavailable, and I’ll get back to you as soon as I can.\nBest wishes,\nEmma Hardy MP\nHull West and Haltemprice\nP.S I’m delighted to announce that Margaret Pinder is the successful candidate to stand as the official Labour Party candidate for the Hull and East Riding Combined Authority Mayoral election in May. Her FaceBook page is here, and if you’d like to get in contact with her email campaign@margaretpinder.com",
  "https_www_emmahardy_org_uk_/https_www_emmahardy_org_uk_2023_12_04_newsletter-november-2023/content_135.html": "Dear friend,\nI hope this finds you well.\nBroadband Installation\nI managed to bring telegraph pole installation temporarily to a halt in Hessle after raising issues around MS3 failing to implement health and safety rules properly with East Riding Council. They forced the company to stop, however it didn’t take them long to comply and begin work again.\nI was pleased to meet with Hessle residents in Parliament to speak about a plan of action moving forward and for them to handover a petition to government.\nI presented a petition in Parliament with over 360 signatures demanding the government to change the rules which allow the current situation of broadband companies essentially being able to install telegraph poles where they want, when they want. The petition will receive an answer from the government in due course, which I will share.\nSmall Business Awards\nIt’s the third year of my Small Business Awards and so many of you nominated fantastic local businesses that this year I decided to put them into categories with an award for the winner of each.\nI’ve been overwhelmed by the number of you who voted for your favourite small businesses in our area. Over 1500 nominations and over 2300 votes! The people of Hull West and Hessle have really gone all out this year to support their favourite local businesses.\nSmall businesses play such a vital role in our local community and I know like many others, small businesses are really feeling the pinch at the moment. The pandemic proved that when it really matters, it’s small local businesses that are there providing the services we need and so it’s really important we support them.\nKeep an eye on my social media to find out who has won in each category and remember, Saturday 2nd December is Small Business Saturday so get out there and shop local!\nPostcards for Veterans\nThis year I teamed up with Adelaide Primary School to create postcards for veterans who were unable to attend remembrance services.\nVeterans from Hull4Heroes, Hull’s Young Mayor, Amaya and myself went to Adelaide Primary to collect the post cards. The veterans talked a little bit about what they did and where they served and some of the students read out their messages of thanks.\nThe messages that were read out made everyone in the room a little bit emotional. I was so impressed with all the students with how articulate and understanding their messages were, they were very moving and written with such compassion.\nHull4Heores then handed these out to veterans over remembrance weekend and also to serving personnel as part of their shoebox appeal.\nI want to say a huge thank you to all pupils and staff at Adelaide Primary School for getting involved in the project and creating such beautiful postcards. I know it will have meant a lot to all those who received one.\nReverse Advent Calendar Appeal\nMy Reverse Advent Calendar Appeal is back for it’s third year!\nThe Reverse Advent Calendar works differently to a traditional one by using the days in late November/ early December to put items into a box daily, ready to take to your local foodbank in time for Christmas week. This means that instead of opening something for yourself for advent, you are giving something back to the community each day.\nI am working with Hull Foodbank, HU4 Community Trust and Hessle and Anlaby Foodbank with the hope that we can get as many people involved in the project as possible. It’s forecasted to be a really difficult winter for many people in our area and this will go a long way to helping those in the community who need it most.\nI understand at the moment people are having to tighten their purses, so please only donate if and what you can, but if you are able to help then I know there will be so many families grateful for the support.\nHere’s a list of suggested items that the foodbanks have said they need:\nTins\n- Fray Bentos pies\n- Tinned ham\n- Corned beef\n- Stewing steak\n- Soup but multipurpose i.e. condensed/chunky\n- Tinned potatoes\n- Spaghetti hoops\n- Tinned meatballs in sauce\n- Baked beans with sausages\n- Macaroni cheese/veggie ravioli\n- Mild curry\n- Custard\n- Rice pudding\n- Tinned fruit cocktail\nPersonal Care\n- Deodorant\n- Body spray\n- Shower Gel\n- Plasters\n- Bar of soap\n- Flannel\n- Toilet roll\n- Toothpaste\n- Toothbrushes\n- Washing powder\n- Washing up liquid\nDried items/packets\n- Cereal (which can be eaten without milk, such as Frosties or Cheerios)\n- Raisins\n- Instant noodles\n- Instant mash\n- Boil in the bag rice\n- Meat paste for sandwiches\n- Crumble mix / crumble topping\n- Kids baking kits where you just add water/oil\n- Ketchup\n- Brown sauce\n- Jam – no ‘bits’ – raspberry good\n- Chocolate spread\n- Stock cubes\n- Gravy granules\n- Granulated sugar\n- Crisps\n- Golden syrup\nDrinks\n- Instant hot chocolate powder\n- Milkshake powder such as Nesquik\n- Powdered milk\n- UHT milk\n- Tea\n- Instant coffee\n- Squash/cordial\nTreats\n- Ginger biscuits\n- Chocolate digestives\n- Yule log (chocolate log)\n- Bars of chocolate\n- Christmas biscuit selection\nFlood prevention in Derringham\nYorkshire Water are currently building a flood scheme in Derringham and want to hear from residents. They are holding drop ins over the next few months at Derringham Priory Baptist Church between 1pm-3pm on the following dates:\n2023\nNovember 22nd\nDecember 6th, & 20th\n2024\nJanuary 3rd, 17th & 31st\nFebruary 14th & 28th\nMarch 13th & 27th\nApril 10th & 24th\nMake sure you have your say!\nI’m really pleased this is happening as the need for a flood scheme in Derringham is something I have been talking to Yorkshire Water about for a while now.

She has been totally dedicated to her role as councillor since her election in 2019, working tirelessly for the area, and I know whenever I need to contact her over any issues in her ward I can expect an immediate response.\nPaul Harper – Boothferry\nAs a retired teacher who spent his entire career teaching in Hull primary schools, Paul understands the people of Hull from the inside out. Since his retirement he has continued to support the community through his work for the Hull Active School Sports programme and as a blue-coat for HEY! Volunteering. A former Deputy Headmaster, Paul understands what responsibility means and the hard work needed to discharge it. He would make an excellent representative on the council.\nAneesa Akbar – Central\nIf you wanted a definition of ‘the heart and soul of the community’ you couldn’t go wrong with Aneesa. I love being out campaigning with Aneesa – there’s hardly a door we knock on or a passer-by in the street who doesn’t know her. Her work with the Peel Street Project is making a huge difference to the area and Aneesa is a fierce campaigner for equality and inclusion. With Aneesa on your side, you will always have have a powerful voice and a loyal friend.\nSarah Hicks – Derringham\nBefore she joined the NHS Mental Health Service, Sarah organised community events for local residents with dementia. Despite her demanding job and being a single parent, Sarah remains committed to improving her local area and as a committee member of The Bank is helping create a community space which will provide much-needed facilities and support for the people of Derringham. She is a resourceful and courageous woman, and I would back her to put the community first every time.\nLynn Petrini – Newington and Gypsyville\nThe current Lord Mayor might need little introduction, but she has always been prepared to go the extra mile to involve herself in the lives of others. I still remember how keen she was to come to the Primary school I taught at with her husband Graham to share their stories of life on the trawlers and in the fishing community of Hessle Road, and what an impression she made on the children. Lynn is Hull through and through and there’s nothing she wouldn’t do for the city.\nTerry Sullivan – Pickering ward\nTerry is the definition of someone who sees a need and then gets on with finding solutions. Together with his wife Dawn, Terry founded the HU4 community group which has now opened HU4 Hub – a space for local residents to go for support, socialise or take part in community events. They have arranged craft sessions for children at Dragon Park, deliver food parcels to families in need, and Terry even dressed at Father Christmas and gave out Christmas hampers to families across Pickering. Terry wears his heart on his sleeve, and what a good heart it is.\nI am confident that every one of these candidates will do an excellent job if elected and I hope you will be supporting them at the ballot-box on Thursday.",

Although the site is not in my constituency, BAE are a big local employer and the men and women who work on the Eurofighter are highly skilled workers. The loss of these jobs is going to have an appalling impact on them, the local economy and wider supply chains.\n“While it is BAE that has taken this decision, it is this Conservative government’s decisions on defence spending that have ultimately led to this situation. They must come forward urgently with a clear plan to secure these jobs at BAE.\n“The major reason that has led to this job loss is the slowdown in orders for the Hawk aircraft that is made at the site at Brough, but the Government could take immediate steps to help this by ordering 9 new Hawks for the Red Arrows and bring forward a Defence Industrial strategy that supports service personnel, industry, British manufacturing and jobs all along the supply chain.”",
  "https_www_emmahardy_org_uk_/https_www_emmahardy_org_uk_2023_10_25_october-2023-newsletter/content_100.html": "I hope this finds you well. The last few weeks have been very busy – the Big Conversation events all over the constituency, the Labour Party Conference and finished off this Saturday with the Menopause Hull 2023 event in Prince’s Quay.\nHowever, I’ll start with something else that has been gaining pace recently, and that is broadband installation in the area.\nThe companies seem to have completed most of their digging and moved on to pole installation resulting in streets with numerous telegraph poles installed by different providers, or poles in areas which previously had none. It’s causing a lot of upset and confusion on what people’s rights are and why the companies aren’t using KCOM’s equipment or sharing each other’s.\nI thought it might be helpful to share what I know and have done up to now.\nBroadband Installation – The Legal Situation\n- Telecom network operators fall under the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991, allowing them to install infrastructure on public roads without needing consent from the local authorities. Telegraph poles are not subject to planning permission, and there are limited requirements for notice to the Local Planning Authority and residents.\n- While Hull City Council and East Riding of Yorkshire Council have received numerous complaints, the current legislation empowers telecoms companies to proceed without permission.\nMy Recent Actions on Broadband Installation\n- Met with all the new telecom providers, urging them to consider underground cabling rather than telegraph poles. Unfortunately, they intend to proceed with their plans as is.\n- Convened a meeting with these companies in an attempt to encourage them to share infrastructure and limit the need for additional poles and street works, but we couldn’t reach an agreement.\n- Attended meetings between residents and company representatives.\n- Raised the issue with the relevant minister, Sir John Whittingdale, who advised me to engage with Ofcom, the UK communications regulator, to seek resolution.\nOfcom’s Involvement\n- After meeting with Ofcom, I learned that they need a formal complaint from one of the new companies to investigate obstacles preventing the economically viable sharing of existing poles and ducting belonging to KCOM. Ofcom lacks the authority to issue instructions to new providers who aren’t existing monopolies.\n- I’ve urged Ofcom to organize a meeting with all the companies involved to work towards a joint resolution. They have agreed to do so, and we have scheduled another meeting with me in a month for an update on their progress.\nLetter to Sir John Whittingdale\n- Following the Ofcom meeting, I wrote to Sir John Whittingdale requesting changes to the rules to empower Ofcom to intervene in sharing infrastructure without waiting for an industry complaint, and to review the impact of the Town and Country Planning Order 2015 on communities in our region. I’m awaiting the minister’s response and will continue collaborating with the other Hull MPs on this issue.\nThe Big Conversation\nThe Big Conversation is over for another year, but it has been a brilliant two weeks of events and meetings. I’ve really enjoyed being in Hull West and Hessle and speaking to residents about the issues which matter most to them.\nWithout a doubt, the biggest concern amongst our community is the cost of living, especially with winter approaching. I’ll be looking at ways to support constituents through the winter and calling on the Government to offer support.\nI held meetings with some of our fantastic local community groups and charities, including HU4 Hub, Royal British Legion, Hessle Road Network and Peel Project’s Women’s Group. These groups provide important opportunities for socialising and mutual support, and I have enormous respect and appreciation for the work they do.\nAll five Facebook live events went well, with expert panels on housing, SEND, flooding, endometriosis and anti-social behaviour. They gave people the opportunity to ask questions direct to the experts and receive immediate answers, and allowed a wider discussion of the topics.\nI took forward the issue of support for endometriosis sufferers at work in a meeting with local trade union reps and HEY Endo Support. Our aim is to make Hull the most endometriosis friendly place to work in the UK.\nI held a coffee morning with Ukrainian refugees to hear about how they’ve settled down in Hull and what issues they’re facing as refugees. With no end to the war in sight, clarity is needed from Government about how long refugees will be able to stay in the UK and I will be taking this directly to the Home Office.\nThe annual plant and seed swap at Anlaby Park Library is always a highlight and it was great to work with Butterfly City, handing out free seeds and plants to encourage people to get their fingers green and make their spaces a home for butterflies.\nOver the next few weeks I’ll be reflecting on the conversations I’ve had and incorporating the concerns and issues raised by constituents into a plan for the upcoming months.\nMenopause Hull 2023\nThe 2023 Menopause Hull event in Princes Quay was a great success, bigger and better than ever with stalls offering support, health and wellbeing tips and wonderful speakers across a range of subjects from HRT to gaining and maintaining your strength through menopause. Special thanks to Menopaus’ull Support Network for co-hosting the event with me.\nIf you missed the event this year then don’t worry, we’ll be back next year. In the meantime, follow the Menopaus’ull link for information, advice and support.\nLabour Conference\nI attended my first events in my new role as Shadow Minister for Flooding, Oceans and Coastal communities. Two were on the familiar subject of flooding and how our planning and building must change to take account of climate change, the other a roundtable on the health of our oceans. It was inspiring to hear people talking so passionately about protecting UK seas and sharing their ideas on how to build a thriving, sustainable “blue economy” to help in the regeneration of our coastal towns and cities.\nI was really excited by the proposals coming out of Conference. Keir Starmer gave an excellent speech which showed he understood the size of the task a Labour government will face to make the changes we desperately need. To do that we need an end to sticking plaster politics and focussed, long-term planning. That focus will come through our five missions – full details here – but the following announcements stood out as particularly good for Hull and the East Riding:\n- I have been campaigning for more dentists in our region, so I was delighted with the pledge for 700,000 extra dental appointments and incentives to recruit new dentists to work in areas with the greatest need.\n- Hospital waiting lists in Hull are simply unacceptable and the pledge for 2 million more operations and NHS procedures can’t come soon enough.\n- Crime is always near the top of local concerns, so again I was very pleased with our five point plan to tackle crime and anti-social behaviour involving guaranteeing town centre patrols and a named officer in every community, a new offence of assault on a retail worker, ending the Tories’ de-prioritisation of shoplifting under £200, and new expedited Public Space Protection Orders to ban known troublemakers from town centres.\n- Jobs are a priority in Hull and East Riding, and our plan to introduce new Technical Excellence Colleges that get people into good jobs and gives local business the workforce they need will give this area a boost – especially with the Humber having a huge potential for the green industries of the future.\n- These policies come on top of already existing commitments to ban zero hours contracts, outlaw fire and rehire, establish GB Energy and have a fair pay agreement in adult social care, all of which will really benefit this region.\nSmall Business Saturday competition\nIf you know a business in Hull West, Hessle, Anlaby, Willerby or Kirk Ella that deserves some recognition then nominate them using this link\nLast year of 650 of you voted for your favourite small business in our area, and this year small businesses need our support more than ever. Let’s show our appreciation for these vital parts of our local community and get nominating!\nAnd finally,\nAs always, please feel free to share this letter with anyone you think might be interested. I will be doing as much as I can to offer assistance and advice over the coming months and represent the constituency in Parliament; please do not hesitate to contact me if you think I can help.",

It does nothing to address the concerns of the people of Hull West and Hessle. It fudges figures, talk in vague terms that half promise money without committing and re-announce funds that they have already committed like it’s a new pot of money.\n“It is easy for the Chancellor to throw around figures but 9 years of Tory austerity are having a real effect on people’s lives. I spoke today in the Chamber about there being no extra money coming forward for children with special education needs and disabilities in schools, despite the fact that there is evidence to suggest that children are being given support not on the basis of what they need but on the basis of what mere rations are available. There is no extra money for roads in Hull, despite the fact that roads like Calvert Lane need to be repaired and remodelled. There is no extra money for mental health, despite the fact that suicides in Yorkshire are up 30% from 10 years ago.\n“This Spring Statement is a complete disappointment and I will be pushing the government over the coming weeks and months to do so much better.”",

I voted against them at every opportunity but ultimately the government’s 80 seat majority saw them prevail.\nThe Elections Bill is an awful piece of legislation which attacks this country’s proud tradition of democracy. It undermines the independence of the Electoral Commission and is set to waste millions of pounds on a completely unnecessary Voter ID system which will make it harder for a lot of people to vote. It is difficult to view this Bill as anything other than an attempt to tip the electoral scales in favour of the Conservative Party.\nInstead of seeking to increase the powers of the independent elections regulator, enabling it to further protect and defend our democracy, this government are instead intent on stripping the Electoral Commission of the ability to do its job. A country where the Electoral Commission is told what to do by the executive is not a country with free and fair elections. The regulator of our elections needs to be independent and impartial, not subject to political control. This is not the behaviour of a government which values the scrutiny and the checks and balances that are the hallmarks of a healthy democracy.\nVoting is safe and secure in Britain. In 2019, a year with a high turnout general election, the UK saw just one conviction for impersonation – which the new voter ID laws are supposed to prevent – out of over 59 million votes. Currently, three and a half million citizens – 7.5% of the electorate – do not have access to any form of photo ID. The elderly, low income and Black, Asian and ethnic minority voters make up the bulk of these citizens. This law is discriminatory, and the need for it is unsupported by evidence. We have every right to be asking why this government has rammed it through against the facts and all outside advice. Once again, we are left with little choice but to conclude it is abusing its position to secure party-political advantage.\nAt a time when freedom in a European country is under direct and violent attack, I am appalled that the government is taking notes from regimes like Vladimir Putin’s on how to remove the right to peaceful protest. The Police, Crime and Sentencing Bill passed this week gives police in the UK the power to restrict protests and arrest protestors which are in their judgement “too noisy”. In other words, a blank cheque to pick and choose which protests are allowed and who is arrested and charged. British protestors can now be removed as quickly and easily as we saw Russian anti-war protestors disappear from their streets. It is a shameful Bill which diminishes us in the eyes of democratic countries the world over.\nThe Bill also effectively criminalises an entire minority and their way of life, by turning trespass from a civil into a criminal offence. This allows the arrest of people who are Gypsies, Roma and Travellers (GRT) and the confiscation of their homes if they stop in places that have not been designated for them. They can also face a three-month jail sentence. A recent study by the group Friends, Families and Travellers found that only eight of the 68 local authorities questioned had met their own identified need for Gypsy and Traveller pitches. There are simply not enough authorised sites and stopping places for the GRT people who need them. The government knows this, but chooses to criminalise those with nowhere to go. This is a callous and unjust attack on a vulnerable minority. These Bills should concern us all. They are deeply undemocratic and speak to a government which is becoming increasingly authoritarian.",

  "https_www_emmahardy_org_uk_/https_www_emmahardy_org_uk_2024_11_01_chencellors-budget-2024/content_79.html": "Dear Friend,\nYesterday saw the first Budget by a Labour government for 14 years, and the first ever Budget delivered by a woman Chancellor, Rachel Reeves. As well as being a woman, Rachel is unusual in being a Chancellor with a Masters degree in Economics and a career in the profession which included working at the Bank of England.\nShe has been handed a challenging inheritance; £22 billion of unfunded in-year spending pressures, debt at its highest since the 1960s, unrealistic plans for departmental spending, and stagnating living standards.\nThose who had been battered by the cost-of-living crisis were in desperate need of support. Public services which had been starved of resources to the point of collapse were in desperate need of an injection of funding. The country’s infrastructure was crumbling after years of neglect.\nI believe she delivered what will prove to be a transformational Budget. It is one that understands and recognises the value of investing in our services, our infrastructure and our people.\nThe commitment to rebalancing the wealth of this country and restoring living standards is clearly illustrated in the graphic below which shows whose lives this Budget will positively impact and by how much.\nAddressing the cost of living\nIn 2022/23, UK household’s disposable income fell by 2.1 per cent, the largest year-on-year drop since records began in the 1950s. To put money into the pockets of those earning least, the Chancellor raised the minimum wage to £12.21 an hour from April 2025. This is the highest real value in the history of the UK’s minimum wage and means a pay-rise for 3 million workers. Someone working full-time on minimum wage will get an extra £1,400 a year.\nI know what an invaluable job carer’s do and from my constituency work how much of a struggle it can be. So, I was delighted to hear Rachel Reeves announce that the Carer’s Allowance weekly earnings limit will be increased by £45 per week. This will make a big difference to so many people. There are also changes being made to ensure that the awful situation we have seen develop where carer’s have been asked to pay large sums back because their earnings slipped over the threshold without anyone noticing will not be repeated.\nAnother problem with overpayments, this time with Universal Credit, has been addressed. It is something that happens quite a lot, as UC for those in work is calculated on a monthly basis and if your income varies every month overpayments can easily occur. A new fair repayment rate will mean UC claimants who have been accidentally overpaid will only have to pay back 15% of their allowance each month, falling from 25%. This means a gain of around £420 a year for roughly 1.2 million households, and I know it will help locally because I have often heard from constituents struggling because of these repayments.\nFree breakfast clubs for all primary school children is a manifesto pledge and Rachel Reeves confirmed there would be £30 million available. A ‘test and learn’ phase will begin from April 2025 in 750 early adopter schools in advance of the national rollout. This will boost parent’s finances as well as ensuring every child starts the school day with a proper meal, whatever their circumstances.\nRachel Reeves also confirmed the extension of the Household Support Fund with an increase in funding to £1 billion. This money goes to councils specifically to support those most in need. This extra funding has allowed both Hull City Council and East Riding Council to make automatic £200 payments to pensioners just above the pension credit threshold who no longer receive Winter Fuel Payments.\nThe full new State Pension will rise £470 a year and the full basic State Pension will increase by £360.\nFuel duty and reduced tax on a pint of beer by 1p.\nAlong with keeping income tax, personal National Insurance contributions and VAT unchanged, Rachel Reeves has made changes that will directly benefit the majority of our country. It’s also worth remembering that a boost for those on the lowest incomes is also a boost for the economy. Most of their income gets spent, going straight back into the economy, much of it locally. This is particularly important for places like Hull.\nPublic services\nThere will be an essential boost in real-terms spending on public services and investment by £326 billion across the next five years.\nThe new investment in the NHS is huge. There is £1.5 billion capital funding for new surgical hubs, diagnostic scanners and new beds which together with the £22.6 billion for day-to-day spending over the next two years will deliver an extra 2 million NHS operations, scans and appointments a year. This will bring waiting lists down, help shift more care into the community and begin to ease the pressure on staff.\nIn our schools there will be more funding to address teacher shortages in key subjects and £2.3 billion increase in the core budget to increase per pupil spending in real terms.\nHowever, this isn’t about “throwing money” at a problem. The government has been clear from the start it will not tolerate wasteful spending – and that means treating taxpayers’ money with respect. For the next financial year, all government departments will have a 2% productivity, efficiency and savings target.\nWe are also pursuing Covid fraud. A Covid Counter-Fraud Commissioner is due to be appointed and over £600 million of fraud which the previous government had ordered written off will now be back under investigation.\nAdditionally, those who owe tax should pay it. Tax loop-holes have been tightened and HMRC will recruit 180 new counter-fraud staff to crack down on tax fraud and evasion.\nInfrastructure\nIf we are to get the country back on its feet, we need to understand not only the value of investing in people but of investing in our infrastructure, and of planning for the long-term.\nNo-one can have failed to notice the state of our roads has got worse. To bring them up to scratch, Rachel Reeves has pledged a total of £1.6 billion to fixing local roads and filling potholes. This isn’t just cosmetic: roads in poor repair have a knock-on effect in extra costs to the economy in vehicle repairs and accidents.\nAs well as more funding to repair the NHS estate, there will be £1.4 billion to tackle crumbling school and college buildings across the country. This paves the way for a long-term strategy to improve schools nationwide so that students can learn in safe, modern buildings.\nAnd we need more affordable housing, whether that’s to rent or buy. The Affordable Homes Programme to kickstart the biggest increase to social and affordable housebuilding in a generation and this Budget added £500 million to the funding.\nProtections for small business\nObviously, government revenues have had to be increased. One source was increasing employer National Insurance contributions. However, small businesses have been protected from the impact by increasing and expanding Employment Allowance, allowing firms to employ up to four National Living Wage workers full time without paying employer National Insurance on their wages.\nThe Treasury will also provide relief on business rates of 40% for the retail, hospitality and leisure industry and from 2026-27 permanently lower tax rates will be introduced.\nA Budget for the future\nThis is a responsible, joined-up Budget by a Chancellor who understands how government finances and markets work. It might come as no surprise then that the International Monetary Fund, who criticised Liz Truss’s disastrous budget and warned Jeremy Hunt about his unfunded tax cuts has praised this budget’s investment in public services and “sustainable tax rises.” It is the Budget of a government which is determined to rebuild the foundations of our economy and our public services, lift up those on the lowest incomes and to make work pay.",

I hope the college seeks all opportunities to work with the unions such as UCU and Unison to ensure as many staff as possible can be redeployed, retrained or given support to seek other employment opportunities.\nI am pleased to have been reassured that this will be the last restructuring Hull College will face for a long time and I look forward to a period of stability so that the staff do not constantly feel the strain of uncertain employment and the students can learn in a supportive environment.\nI wish everyone the best at the college and will continue to support you as much as I can.",

  "https_www_emmahardy_org_uk_/https_www_emmahardy_org_uk_2023_01_25_january-2023-newsletter/content_362.html": "We’re well into January now, and I hope this finds you all well and looking forward to 2023. I’m writing this on so-called Blue Monday, but I was reading a post from the Samaritans explaining that this was a myth – there’s no evidence to suggest it’s any worse than any other Monday and it was made up by a travel company in 2005 to help sell holidays. They would like to rename it “Brew Monday” – a day where we reach out to connect with family, friends, colleagues and loved ones, and make time for a cuppa and a catch-up. I think that’s a great idea. There’s no reason why any Monday can’t be a “Brew Monday”, and there are ideas and resources for holding your own here. Make it a regular thing and help put a smile on someone’s face.\nCost of living\nThe company and emotional support of others is an important part of keeping healthy and happy, but we still have to pay the bills, and I know things will be difficult for a lot of us this year. That’s why I do a lot of work in Parliament on trying to make sure work pays, and that the poorest don’t end up paying more for products and services than everyone else. For example today I signed a letter to the government asking for a ban on forcing people onto gas and electric prepay meters and fixing the unfairness in pricing which sees meter users pay a higher rate than everybody else.\nWhen I was invited to serve on the Treasury Select Committee I understood holding ministers and institutions to account over financial matters was important, but I wasn’t sure how applicable it would be to my constituency work. It turns out it really is. Recently I have been able to ask the Chancellor about the “tax gap”, which is the difference between how much tax should be collected and how much actually is – a staggering £32 billion for 2022! That money is desperately needed and I was able to quiz him on why the Treasury wasn’t spending more on fraud and evasion (which claws back £18 for every £1 spent). Next week we will be questioning the Governor of the Bank of England on interest rates, which affect everyone with a mortgage and variable rate debt repayments.\nTo help in the constituency I am putting on a Cost of Living Facebook Live event on Thursday 26 January. Panellists will include Martin Coppack, from Fair by Design, with whom I have been working closely on ‘financial inclusion’ (explainer on this important work here), and for specialist advice on the effect of the cost of living increases on people with disabilities, there will be a representative from the charity SENSE.\nFinally on this subject, a reminder that I have put together a booklet with everything my office has learnt about dealing with debt, along with information on how to make sure you are getting any grants or benefits you are entitled to, which is available here. If you can’t find the help you need in it, don’t hesitate to contact me directly and please share this information.\nKnow your employment rights\nI will also be hosting a FaceBook Live event on employment rights on Thursday 9 February. It will hopefully provide you with everything you need to know on what you can expect from your employer and what your rights are. Panellists will include an employments rights solicitor, a representative from Disability Rights UK, as well as Trade Union reps.\nDetails of this and the Cost of Living Event will be on my Facebook page.\nCarol Thomas\nUntil the fantastic achievement of the Lionesses in winning the Euros at Wembley last year, the most successful women’s England captain in terms of trophies was Hull’s own Carol Thomas, who lead the team over 50 times and lifted the unofficial world cup, Mundialito, in1985. This was before the team was under the auspices of the FA, so they tend not to include these achievements when talking about the current England women’s team, which is a shame. Nevertheless, she was inducted into to the English Football Hall of Fame last year, and I had the pleasure of meeting her to celebrate. The stories she shared about her experiences in the football world back in the 70s and 80s were amazing.\nI’m delighted to say she was given the Freedom of the City of Hull by the Lord Mayor in a ceremony in the Guildhall last Thursday, and quite right too!\nBirds, butterflies and a new wildflower meadow\nAs you might know, I am the RSPB Parliamentary Species Champion for the Brimstone Butterfly. I was asked to accept the role because of my work supporting the Butterfly City project. I am delighted to say that the constituency now has its first Butterfly City wildflower meadow on Park Street. The Land Registry have agreed to manage a large area of grass on their premises as a wildflower meadow. Previously, this was cut regularly but will now be managed for wild flowers and grasses. They have put up signs explaining the work and I’m looking forward to its first year without regular mowing which will allow flowers to bloom and pollinating insects to feed. The longer grass will also be home to many more invertebrates, which in turn provide food for birds and small mammals like shrews and voles.\nNational threat to wildlife\nThe RSPB, along with several other wildlife charities, contacted me recently over their extreme concerns for nature protection because of the proposed government Bill to scrap all EU legislation by the end of the year, regardless of whether it has been replaced. This covers at least 1,100 pieces of environmental law and 1,000s more pieces of environmental “minor regulation”. A lot of this existed before we joined the EU and has been adopted into it, and much more has been enhanced by the UK government itself – as EU protections are only a minimum. These cover things like rare habitats and species protections, clean water, pesticide use and there is simply not enough time to review and properly replace them all. Wildlife charities are saying this would be a huge backward step from all the work done protecting our nature and environment, and I agree.\nBig Garden Garden Birdwatch\nThe RSPB’s Big Garden Garden Birdwatch is taking place this month, 27 – 29 January and you don’t actually need a garden to take part. If you are interested, the details are here\nAs always, please feel free to share this letter with anyone you think might be interested. I will be doing as much as I can to offer assistance and advice over the coming months and represent the constituency in Parliament; please do not hesitate to contact me if you think I can help.\nAll the best for 2023\nEmma",

I am pushing forward to introduce regulations to the funeral director profession and I recently met with the new Minister, Alex Davies, to discuss this and hope to make further progress on this in the very near future.\nI know Hull City Council and East Riding of Yorkshire Council are continuing to provide a support line for anyone who has been affected by this. You can contact the support line by calling- 0800 281 1136. There are also ongoing talks with Hull City Council with those directly affected about a permanent memorial place.\nDuring this moment of reflection, I wanted to highlight how amazing our community is. We banded together in the most devastating circumstances.

  "https_www_emmahardy_org_uk_/https_www_emmahardy_org_uk_2023_06_27_22717/content_209.html": "Dear Friend,\nI hope this finds you well. The last bank holiday weekend of May is over and summer is on its way – even if the weather doesn’t quite agree yet! June will see Shadow Secretary of State for Business and Industrial Strategy visiting Hull to see some of the exciting start-up businesses in the city and meet the people behind them, as well as a tour of tech-hub CD4I. There’s also the Great Get Together event on Saturday 24th – details tbc.\nMinster meeting over funding\nHull needs a fairer share of central development funding, especially after the Humber region’s bid for developing carbon capture and hydrogen power was surprisingly rejected. I met recently with Dehenna Davison, the Minister for Levelling Up, to press Hull’s case and to explain in more detail some of the challenges – and opportunities – for Hull and the region. The minister listened to what we had to say, and I hope that our continued pressure on this issue will eventually bear fruit.\nNHS Dentist petition\nAs you know, I am campaigning to make sure everyone can access an NHS dentist, and as part of that campaign, Diana Johnson and I met with Minister for Primary Care and Public Health, Neil O’Brien to discuss a Dental School in the region. The Universities of Hull and York are ready and willing to establish one on the same lines as the Hull York Medical School which opened in 2003, and now sees over 150 newly qualified doctors a year enter the profession.\nYou can do your bit by adding your name to the petition “we need more NHS dentists in Hull and East Riding” here.\nFacebook Live event\nI also organized a Facebook Live event with Mark Green, an NHS dentist working in Kirbymoorside and representing the British Dental Association, and Chris Groombridge, Director of the Association of Dental Groups. It was an eye-opening hour, and is still available to watch here. Thanks to everyone who contributed.\nCurrently we are training 1.300 dentists a year when we need to train 2,000. This is why a Dental School in the area makes perfect sense. We also learnt that the current NHS contract has been unfit for purpose for more than 10 years, but the promised reforms have still not been made and dentists are unable to keep their business going on NHS fees alone. This is forcing them into the private sector to subsidise their NHS work. Many are giving up NHS work altogether or simply leaving the profession.\nThere was some good news: Mark and Chris have got NHS England to agree a trial system for North Yorkshire and Humberside where if you can’t get an NHS dentist, but you need treatment, you can ring 111 and they will find you one. You won’t be “put on the books” but you will have your immediate problem sorted. If you know anyone in this situation, please let them know.\nNew constituency boundaries\nI’m delighted to announce that I am now officially the Labour candidate for the next General Election for the new constituency of Hull West and Hessle Borough, although the decision on the name lies with Boundary Commission who are also considering Hull West and Haltemprice. The new constituency consists of the West Hull wards of St Andrews and Docklands, Newington and Gypysville, Derringham, Boothferry and Pickering, and the East Riding wards of Hessle, Tranby, and Willerby and Kirk Ella.\nIf you live in any of the new wards and you’d like to get to know more about helping with campaigning, then please drop me a message and I’ll get in touch (ex-pupils are especially welcome!). Similarly, if you know anyone in the new wards who might be interested in receiving this newsletter, please let them know.\nUntil the next General Election I remain the MP for the original constituency of Hull West and Hessle and I will carry on working my hardest to give everyone the best representation I can.\nFloodwater management and increasing biodiversity\nKeeping more water on land for longer helps prevent flooding elsewhere, and recently I took a trip outside the constituency to visit Dumble Farm in Arram because that’s exactly what they are doing. By converting pasture to water meadow, they are also creating more habitat for ground nesting birds like Lapwing, Skylark and Meadow Pipit. The meadows hold flood water from the River Hull, which is water that would otherwise be travelling downstream into the city.\nTheir beautiful (and super cute!) Highland cattle are the perfect grazing animals for sustaining this landscape. Currently, there is no funding available for using land to hold back water and this is something I would like to see change. The government has made promises that this will be available through the new Environmental Land Management Scheme in future years, but the devil is always in the details.\nApplying for funding is a difficult and complex process as Fi explained to me. We need to make the process more straightforward for farmers, especially those on small farms who can’t afford consultants.\nDumble Farm is also open to the public so you can help support them and go on a farm tour on their awesome bus and walk the younger Highland cows! Find out more on their Facebook page Dumble Farm\nAnd finally,\nAs always, please feel free to share this letter with anyone you think might be interested. I will be doing as much as I can to offer assistance and advice over the coming months and represent the constituency in Parliament; please do not hesitate to contact me if you think I can help.",

This not only has a negative impact on the physical and mental wellbeing of those children, it also impairs learning by reducing their ability to concentrate.\nAlmost half of respondents to a survey by the National Education Union stated that their school directly provides one or more of a range of anti-poverty services such as a food club, a food or clothing bank, free or subsidised family meals and in a small number of cases, emergency loans to families. All of these services are suffering because of government school funding cuts.\nMeanwhile, the Chief Executive Officers and other senior staff at some Multi Academy Trusts are receiving large yearly pay packets from tax payers money.\nCommenting after the exchange, Emma said “Nobody is saying that schools cannot improve educational outcomes for disadvantaged children but to deny the role of outside factors in entrenching educational disadvantage is simply not realistic, nor is it fair. It is even harder for them to do that when taxpayers’ money- already in short supply because of this Government’s education cuts- are being taken away from schools and handed over to line the pockets of MAT CEOs and senior staff. I asked Nick Gibb today where his priorities lie and it’s clear that our priorities are very different.”\nYou can see Emma’s full exchange with Nick Gibb on her Youtube page.",

In her speech she argued that Young Offenders Institutions (YOIs) must balance punishing a child for committing a crime with the need for rehabilitation and assisting the child to become a productive member of society who will not offend again on release. The use of segregation in YOIs, in a similar manner to those used in adult prisons, does not create the right balance between these goals.\nEmma commented “To send a child to prison is something that nobody wants to see done. It shows a failure of many parts of our societal infrastructure and everyone would agree that it should definitely be a last resort. Young Offenders Institutions (YOIs) must balance punishing a child for committing a crime with the need for rehabilitation and assisting the child to become a productive member of society who will not offend again on release.\n“The use of segregation in YOIs, in a similar manner to those used in adult prisons, does not create the right balance between these goals. When we are witnessing a serious mental health epidemic in our prisons the Government must ask themselves why they are subjecting young people to segregation for extended periods, particularly as they know the impact that it has and how ineffective it is in helping rehabilitation.”",
  "https_www_emmahardy_org_uk_/https_www_emmahardy_org_uk_2024_04_26_telegraph-pole-update/content_267.html": "It’s been a while since I last updated you on the work I have been doing to tackle the proliferation of telegraph poles across Hull West and Hessle. I know that many of my constituents have contacted me directly to express their frustration and I would like to reassure everyone that I know how much you care about this issue and that i’m working hard to ensure a positive outcome for my constituents and our local area.\nI’m pleased to say that, since my last update in January, there has been some positive developments regarding infrastructure sharing and we now know that talks between KCOM and Connexin are underway.\nif you’ve contacted me about telegraph poles or seen me on TV, you will know that I believe that infrastructure sharing, that is, new providers using KCOM’s telegraph poles and ducts, rather than installing their own, is the only way to stop vast numbers of telegraph poles being installed all across Hull West and Hessle like we have seen in recent months. The beginning of talks between KCOM and Connexin has also meant that Connexin has ‘paused’ the installation of any new telegraph poles for the time-being (although you may still see engineers wiring telegraph poles that have already been put up).\nSince January, I have tried my best to respond this issue locally by meeting with KCOM, MS3 and Connexin to urge them all to work together and to reach an agreement on infrastructure sharing. and also by raising it with the government. In my last update, I told you that I had written to the Minister, Julia Lopez, to ask that she in her a role as government minister, instruct Ofcom to take action to review guidance around infrastructure sharing.\nFollowing this, I attended a ’roundtable event’ hosted by Minister Lopez and attended by several other MPs. In this meeting I made clear the issues faced by my constituents and the impact of the continuous works on the environment and in our local area. After the meeting, I also signed a joint letter (below) to the Minister to reiterate all of the concerns raised in the meeting. I know some of you have contacted me about the use of creosote on telegraph poles and this was again addressed with the Minister.\nYou will see from the response I received below that the Minister has listened to the concerns raised by myself and the other MPs. One of the things the government has done is to take steps to issue further guidance to the local councils as to how they might prevent providers from simply turning up and installing telegraph poles and clarified Ofcom’s role should new providers not adhere to the requirements and guidelines put in place.\nYou will see that the government has given confirmation that the substance creosote has undergone rigorous safety checks and is currently approved for use to preserve telegraph poles.\nRegrettably, the government has stopped short of introducing legislation that would force providers to share infrastructure, instead preferring to focus efforts on delivering better working practices in the industry. This is is disappointing given the impact that the lack of this type of legislation has had on the local area, i.e. numerous providers digging up streets to install cabling or installing telegraph poles.\nAlthough there has been some positive developments and Connexin has currently paused its works whilst infrastructure sharing is explored, please be assured that I will continue to work with and to urge these local providers to share infrastructure for the benefit of all.\nI hope this update reassures you that I have and will continue to work hard on this issue – by liaising with local providers and the government – to ensure that our streets are no longer blighted by the installation of broadband infrastructure.",

They have raised concerns that the assessment form, descriptors and face-to-face assessments are not set up in a way that accurately reflects the fluctuating nature of epilepsy.\n3 out of 5 people with epilepsy who had previously received Disability Living Allowance had their award decreased or disallowed when they were reassessed for PIP. In raw numbers, this is 18,000 people, 20% higher than for any other condition. In Hull West and Hessle, 1800 people have applied for PIP since 2013, of which 1000 have had their award reduced.\nCommenting after the debate, Emma said:\n“The Government set up the Personal Independence Payment to provide independence to those with long term health conditions.\n“Yet despite this, the stress that the process causes can make people’s illnesses worse, too many applications are judged by people with no medical training and PIP’s points based system leaves too many people with less visible conditions to fall through the gaps.\nAccording to Epilepsy Action, the number one reason given for a claimant not taking their case further was the stress of going through the appeal. Can you imagine having to make that decision? Choosing, on the one hand to go through an arduous trial of your condition or, on the other, to give up the money that has given you independence and quality of life? Where do you even start with a decision like that?\nI am concerned that the departments previous announcement by the department around supervision and safety, which is the change that could potentially have the most impact for people with epilepsy, is in danger of being neglected.\n“In short, on the question of providing quality of life and independence, PIP has so far categorically failed and needs to be reformed. I hope that the Government will agree with the suggestions I have made and take the first steps to making the PIP assessment system fairer.”",

  "https_www_emmahardy_org_uk_/https_www_emmahardy_org_uk_2021_06_22_the-heartbreaking-reality-of-retail-worker-abuse/content_91.html": "Article by Emma Hardy\nCoronavirus crisis threw a light on the vital roles of many previously unheralded workers without whom our country simply cannot function. A new term was coined – “key workers” – and there was a new appreciation of these people and their roles in our daily lives.\nSo, it is heartbreaking to discover that during the crisis there has been a significant increase in abuse, threats and violence towards workers in the retail sector.\nUSDAW’s survey during the peak of the first wave showed incidents of abuse had doubled compared to 2019. I have personally received communications from constituents who have been on the receiving end of such abuse – which included cases of actual physical assault – and which have led to increased anxiety and clinical depression.\nThe most recent USDAW survey of 2,729 shopworkers across the UK found that 88% had experienced verbal abuse, 61% had been threatened by a customer and a shocking 9% had suffered actual assault.\nThe Co-op’s survey of its own workers backs up these results, with one in four of its front line shopworkers reporting violence, abuse and anti-social behaviour, and a 36% increase in these incidents during the first year of the pandemic.\nI believe this situation cannot be allowed to continue, and it appears the public agree. The Co-op also included their customers in their survey, 84% of whom said it was unacceptable for shopworkers to put up with any form of violence or abuse and 82% calling for greater sentencing for offenders.\nOn September 22 2020, I raised the increased abuse that shop workers were reporting with The Lord Chancellor. He replied that it was “incumbent on all of us to make sure that sentencing guidelines properly reflect the role that they [the shopworkers] play.”\nI am aware Government ran a public consultation on violence and abuse toward shop staff last year. However, the scope of the original Call for Evidence was limited to asking if there was further non-legislative action which the Government could take\nThis was despite their being an almost universal view across the in industry – from trade bodies like British Retail Consortium, the Association of Convenience Stores and the Co-op Group as well as all the unions, that legislation was necessary because the current laws in England were failing retail workers\nAt the end of 2019, the Co-op submitted a Freedom of Information request to all police forces – 75% of whom responded. The results showed that two out of every three incidents reported in Co-op stores across the UK did not even lead to the police attending. Where police did attend, prosecution was unlikely. Usdaw has collected numerous examples of the police and CPS deciding not to prosecute cases, in spite of ample evidence. Members report that decisions on whether to prosecute are based on the value of any thefts or property damage, not on the impact on retail workers.\nIn February 2021, over 65 leading retailers and industry bodies wrote to the Prime Minister calling on him to take urgent action to tackle violence and abuse towards retail workers and to call for the creation of a new statutory offence of abusing, threatening or assaulting a retail worker.\nSadly, the government declined the opportunity to include legislation to increase protections for these valuable workers in the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill this year. Nor did it choose to support my hon. Friend Alex Norris, in his efforts to bring in a private Member’s Bill on assaults on retail workers.\nThis has not been the case in Scotland, where cross-party cooperation has led to its retail workers now enjoying a greater protection than those in England. On January 19 this year the Scottish Parliament unanimously passed Daniel Johnson MSP’s member’s bill, the Protection of Workers (Retail and Age-restricted Goods and Services) (Scotland) Act, giving greater protection in law to retail workers, particularly where they are providing goods and services that are age restricted.\nEvery day in 2019, 455 staff were abused or assaulted. It is time for the government to bring forward legislation that offers English retail workers the same protection they deserve, and that are enjoyed by their colleagues in Scotland; protections that have the support of the general public, retail employers and the unions.",

The Government’s real-terms cuts to education funding have seen £2.8 billion cut from school budgets since 2015. This is resulting in significant damage to the education our schools and colleges are able to provide.\nWorse still is on the horizon with 17,942 schools (equal to nine out of ten) hit by a real terms cut in funding per pupil from 2015-19.\nNew research by the school cuts coalition of unions (NEU, NAHT, ASCL, UNISON, GMB and Unite) shows that 62% of secondary schools in England have increased the size of their classes in the last two years (2014/15 to 2016/17).\nOver the same period, staff numbers in England’s secondary schools have fallen by 15,000 between despite their being 4,500 more pupils to teach.\nThe School Cuts website has recently been updated to include these new figures on staffing numbers. The website continues to provide details of the cuts since 2015 school by school. The website indicates that, on average, school funding has been cut by £250 per pupil in Hull West and Hessle over that time frame.\nCommenting, Emma said:\n“Schools have been doing all they can to shield their pupils from the damage caused by this Conservative Government’s decision to cut £2.8 billion from school budgets since 2015 but this lack of investment is really starting to bite.\n“I am not going to stand back and let these cuts happen. Children and young people only get one chance at school and college and we know that education cuts never heal. As a country we should be investing in this and future generations of young people. I am calling on the Government to urgently address the funding crisis urgently and not continue to ignore these very real problems”.",

It has been there for us for over 76 years, but to make sure it is here for the next 76 years, doing all it can to support the health of everyone, we need to make changes. Of course it needs proper funding, but the world is changing quickly, and the NHS needs to change with it.\nSo we want to have the biggest ever conversation about the future of the NHS, and we want you to be a part of it, whether that’s as a member of the public, a patient, staff, or as a member of health or the care industry.\nIt doesn’t matter whether you have a lot or a little to say. Your views, experiences and ideas will shape a new 10 Year Health Plan for England.\nWe have created a dedicated website and questionnaires at Change.NHS.uk as a part of creating a health service fit for the future. This is an early opportunity to share your insights as we begin an extensive programme of engagement to develop the 10 Year Health Plan. If you register your email address, we will stay in touch so we can continue to seek your views as the 10 Year Health Plan develops.\nHull City Council consultation on current Public Spaces Protection Orders\nThere is also a local consultation process underway which you might want to contribute to.\nA Public Spaces Protection Order (PSPO) can be used to deal with the consumption of alcohol in public spaces where it is, or is likely to be, detrimental to the local community’s quality of life.\nThe current Public Spaces Protection Order (PSPO) in Hull is due for renewal March 2025 and Hull City Council is holding a consultation to give residents, businesses and visitors the opportunity to comment on the proposed prohibitions.\nIf you are a resident, visitor, worker or run a business in the following wards\n- Drypool\n- St Andrews and Dockland\n- Newington and Gipsyville\n- Avenue\n- Bricknell\n- Central\n- Orchard Park\n- University\n- Beverley and Newland\nThe council want your input. Have your say here. The consultation closes 2 December 2024.\nThe Big Conversation\nThe Big Conversation has been a Big Success again, and I have really enjoyed being out and about in the constituency. It was really interesting talking to students at Ron Dearing UTC about their hopes and fears for the future.\nThey were a bright and ambitious group and our conversations left me feeling optimistic.\nI also met veterans at the Hull 4 Heroes Armed Forces Community Hub and discussed Labour’s Homes for Heroes policy, which will guarantee our veterans have a roof over their heads. I also took the BC to the “new” part of the constituency at St Andrews Church in Kirkella, where I spoke with the Rector and church leadership about issues which can affect people in the community, such as loneliness.\nSmall businesses are the backbone of our local economy and I met with the Hull Federation of Small Businesses to discuss how we can support them to thrive, including doing more to ensure businesses stay connected with one another and how we can encourage people to shop with their local small businesses.\nI held an online webinar on dentistry and was delighted to learn that a Centre for Dental Development will be opening soon in Hull, which will allow students to learn here (and hopefully stay after qualification) and will take people from NHS waiting lists across the city to ease the backlog.\nMenopause Hull 2024 event\nAfter last year’s success, I am excited to be working with the fantastic women in the Menopaus’ull Support Network team to put on the Menopause Hull 2024 event at Princes Quay Shopping Centre, from 11:00 am – 3:00 pm. The menopause affects half of our population at some point in their lives and is so often more than a few “hot flushes”. Events like this help increase understanding and awareness and provide support and sign-posting to those who need it.\nIt is promising to be a great event once again so I hope that lots of you will come along!\nBack to school with RE: Uniform\nIt’s over five years since I sat in an Education Select Committee hearing, listening to mothers explaining how they had to skip meals to be able to afford school uniform. That shocking testimony drove me to work with some fantastic people locally in the creation of RE:Uniform.\nIt’s the start of the new school year, so they have been busy again with the redistribution of unwanted but perfectly usable school uniform in Hull and the East Riding, keeping it out of landfill and saving parents much-needed money. They even found time to get a photo of them all together. Brilliant!\nRNIB walk\nThe RNIB took the saying “walk a mile in another’s shoes” literally and arranged for me to go on a guided walk in Hull city centre wearing a special pair of glasses.\nI’ve worked closely with the RNIB for a while and thought I had a grasp of the barriers blind and visually impaired people face but the walk proved I really had no clue.\nI felt incredibly vulnerable; it really brought home the barriers those with sight loss face trying to maintain their independence, and what can be done to help.\nPavement parking\nA particular hazard for those with visual impairment – and many others with a disability, people with pushchairs and sometimes anybody at all trying to get past is pavement parking.\nLocal Authorities have very limited powers to prevent pavement parking, and I raised this matter with the previous government on a number of occasions through a series of Parliamentary Written Questions. They halted a private member’s Bill on pavement parking with the promise of a public consultation on how new legislation should look. Although the consultation was held, it closed in 2020 and the government never published a summary and response, despite promising to do so.\nAfter the General Election. I wrote to the new Secretary of State.\nI am pleased to report that I received a reply from Lilian Greenwood, Minister for the Future of Roads, saying her plan is to publish a formal response to the consultation, summarising the views received and announcing the Government’s next steps for pavement parking policy.\nIt looks like we will finally get some progress – all it took was four years and General Election!\nBiowise\nAs MP for the new constituency of West Hull and Haltemprice I now have a lot of constituents affected by odour from the Biowise plant which processes household organic waste to produce compost.\nJudging from the emails I have received, although work has been undertaken at the plant there are still issues with odours, so I began correspondence with Biowise and the Environment Agency.\nI attended the community liaison meeting held by Biowise on September 19 along with representatives of the Environment Agency, Environmental Health, East Riding and Hull City Councils, and local councillors.\nBiowise has now completed all the improvements on site requested by the Environment Agency which were determined by ‘Best Available Techniques’. These included adding covers to bays and a carbon filtration system for the leachate tank.\nThis was followed by the first period of monitoring from June to the end of August, which was undertaken by an accredited third party, with the protocol designed by the national EA odour team. Its purpose is to check the efficacy of the improvements, identify the processes and activities where odour is generated and to quantify it to allow meaningful comparison with the next round of monitoring in summer 2025. The first results are expected later in the Autumn.\nAt the meeting I shared my opinion that the results will be invaluable for getting a clear idea of what activities are causing the most odour and how they might be used to help develop action plans to further reduce it.\nI have also obtained a definition of the 1-6 smell scale used by the EA and other agencies and thought you might find it helpful too. Feel free to share it.\nIntensity\n0 – No odour\n1 – Very faint odour (need to inhale into the wind to smell anything)\n2 – Faint odour (you can detect an odour when you breathe normally)\n3 – Distinct odour (there is clearly an odour in the air as you leave your car or enter the area)\n4 – Strong odour (a bearable odour but strong, you could stay in the area for some time)\n5 – Very strong odour (unpleasantly strong, you will want to leave the area quickly)\n6 – Extremely strong odour (likely to cause nausea and a strong need to remove yourself from the odour immediately)\nIt is useful to include this when making a complaint to the EA, which is best done on the Environment incident hotline: 0800 80 70 60 (24-hour service)\nThe next steps following the meeting will be to look at what the monitoring data is saying, and I will be following up with EA on the timetable for that information which it was agreed will be publicly available.\nLegacy Independent Funeral Directors and the Fuller Report\nThe Fuller Inquiry was established to investigate how David Fuller was able to carry out inappropriate and unlawful actions in the mortuaries at Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust and why they went apparently unnoticed. It began before the awful circumstances around Legacy Independent Funeral Directors became known, but phase 2 of its inquiry looked at the broader national picture on procedures and practices in any settings where deceased people are kept, regarding the security and dignity of the deceased.\nIt has published its phase 2 interim report, and although it could not take evidence directly from those affected by Legacy due to the ongoing legal proceedings, the Inquiry was very much aware of what had happened and its findings will resonate deeply with people in Hull and East Yorkshire.\nIt makes five recommendations, the first of which is that the UK government should establish an independent statutory regulatory regime for funeral directors in England as a matter of urgency. It emphasises the need for action by saying “The Inquiry would expect to be informed by the government what this statutory regulatory regime will be before publication of the Inquiry’s Final Report.”\nIt goes on to recommend the new standards and regulations should cover the whole journey of the deceased, not just funeral directors, and that direct cremation businesses should also be included.\nThe full report can be found here\nIn September we passed the six-month mark since our community was shaken to its core by the revelations of what had happened at Legacy. My thoughts continue to be with the family, friends and loved ones of the victims of these awful crimes. Needless to say, I will be giving these recommendations my wholehearted backing and will be pressing the government to act on them without delay in the hope they will ensure the terrible events of Legacy and the suffering of the families and loved ones affected can never be repeated.\nGet Green!\nA chance to get outside, get your hands dirty and do something positive for nature this weekend!\nVolunteers are needed to plant 4,000 wildflowers and 120 trees at Humber Bridge Country Park. Sessions will be held from Saturday 26 to Monday 28 October. Wildflower meadows help bees, butterflies and other creatures thrive and spending time in them is good for the soul.

That said, I will start with the commemorations of 50th Anniversary of the loss of the Gaul.\n50th Anniversary of the Gaul\nThe Gaul was lost with all hands sometime during the night of February 8/9th 1974 in storm conditions in the Barents Sea. Last week saw a series of events organised by Bullnose and STAND to commemorate the 50th anniversary of that tragic night and it was an honour and a privilege to attend them.\nIn Parliament I tabled an Early Day Motion.\nThe events were all very moving. I was particularly touched hearing the original Gaul Bell, salvaged from the wreckage, rung and the heartfelt words from relatives who had lost loved ones. There were two fabulous murals unveiled – at the MKM Stadium and the Boulevard, It was great to see our football and rugby teams unite to honour the memory not just of those who were lost on the Gaul, but of all those who have sailed from Hull for the fishing grounds of the Northern and Arctic Seas, never to return.\nThe deep-rooted connection between our community and the fishing industry remains unbroken and will never be forgotten.\nFuture Parliament School\nI’m thrilled to announce the launch of the Future Parliament School, a three-day programme designed to provide 16-19 year olds in Hull West and Hessle with a comprehensive understanding of UK politics at all levels.\nIt is really important to me that future generations understand, and are actively engaged in, the political processes that affect their lives. Hull West and Hessle had a low voter turnout in the last general election and I believe something needs to be done to help get young people have a better understanding of the role of an MP and why it is important.\nI have developed a programme with Hull College and University of Hull to start to address this and to raise awareness of the many career opportunities in politics that beyond being an MP.\nThe programme will cover various aspects of UK politics, including parliamentary roles, the running of a local council and public speaking skills, and contain guidance from experienced professionals including media experts.\nGuest speakers will also include the CEO of Hull City Council, Matt Jukes, the leader of the Council, Mike Ross, and leader of the opposition, Daren Hale. And of course, yours truly.\nThe Future Parliament School will challenge the notion that a career in politics depends on who you know. We need a political landscape that represents a wider cross section of our country, but that will only happen if we have the confidence to put ourselves forward. This course will widen the knowledge, understanding and opportunity of young people in the constituency.\nIf you know of anyone living in Hull West and Hessle who is 16-19 and might be interested, then please encourage them to apply here- https://bit.ly/3Uqi6OD\nRe:Uniform\nIt’s hard to believe that Re:Uniform was launched almost five years ago and has sent out over 4,800 bags of uniforms to families struggling with school uniform costs. Demand for our service has increased amidst the worsening cost of living crisis.\nThis week, I volunteered at Re:Uniform, assisting with making up and delivering bags for families in Hull West and Hessle. As a mother, I understand the challenge of keeping up with the needs of growing children and the financial strain of having to purchase expensive branded uniforms when affordable alternatives exist.\nWhile projects like Re:Uniform offer vital support, sending children to school should not be financial burden. Since becoming an MP I’ve advocated for lower school uniform prices. Although progress was made with the School Uniform Bill passed in 2022, enforcement remains lacking. According to the Children’s Society in 2023, the average annual cost for primary and secondary school uniforms was £287 and £422 respectively.\nI’m pleased that the Labour Party has proposed a policy limiting schools to only two mandatory branded uniform items. This will significantly reduce the costs on families, saving them hundreds of pounds annually.Until then, Re:Uniform are always looking for volunteers to help deliver uniforms to those in need, especially during school holidays. So, if you or anyone you know can help them out, please get in touch- Reuniform.trinity@gmail.com\nButterfly City is back!\nButterfly City is partnering with Mires Beck Nursery and Reckitts to distribute 2,000 buckthorn plants to the community. These plants, provided, will be available at various events and pop-ups across the city.\nThe initiative aims to boost the Brimstone butterfly population in Hull and enhance biodiversity. The Brimstone caterpillar thrives on healthy buckthorn plants, which are essential for its growth. Additionally, buckthorn flowers attract bees, contributing to pollination efforts.\nThe first giveaway stall will be at the Hull Seed Swap event at Jubilee Central on Saturday, 24th February. Pop along to learn more about butterflies, attracting them to your outdoor space, and to collect your complimentary buckthorn plant and care leaflet. Let 2024 mark the year you engage in gardening, support butterfly conservation, and help environmental sustainability. Stay updated on additional giveaway dates and\nlocations by following Butterfly City’s Facebook page.\nNational Apprenticeships Week\nDuring National Apprenticeships Week, I visited two apprentices in Hull West and Hessle, each pursuing different paths, showcasing the diversity of opportunities available through apprenticeships.\nJosh, a degree apprentice at Asda, highlighted the invaluable hands-on experience gained alongside his degree qualification. He emphasized how this approach better prepares him for his future career compared to a traditional university route, thanks to learning on the job and working with experienced colleagues.\nOn the other hand, Lauren, undergoing a tailoring apprenticeship at Cock of the Walk, shared that without the apprenticeship, she wouldn’t have acquired the necessary skills to become a tailor. Despite initially pursuing a textiles degree, she felt inexperienced after graduating. The apprenticeship provided her with the practical experience she lacked.\nWhile I’ve long supported apprenticeships, there’s a need to further encourage businesses to take on apprentices and raise awareness among young people about the range of options available. “You don’t know what you don’t know” – if young people aren’t aware of their options they can’t take them up. It’s really important young people are provided with high quality advice early in their journey through secondary school. Labour’s commitment to provide careers advice covering all options to all young people is something I am 100% behind.\nCost of Living\nI know from conversations across Hull West and Hessle that for too many people work doesn’t pay anymore. Families in our area are facing the biggest hit to living standards on record, trapped in the cycle of insecure work, with costs spiralling.\nI recently visited St Martin’s Foodbank on Anlaby Road. The volunteers there do a fantastic job and it was a pleasure to be able to thank them in person. Reading their 2023 report, I was shocked to see that the largest percentage of users were people in employment. This should never be the case.\nWe must make work pay, and I am pleased to support Labour’s ‘New Deal for Working People’ which will boost wages, make work more secure, and support working people to thrive.\nDelivering a genuine living wage, banning zero hour contracts, and ending fire and rehire. This will create jobs that provide security and a decent wage. But this won’t just benefit working people. The plan will be good for businesses and the economy too.\nIt’s surely time to change the cycle of low pay, low investment, and low productivity.\nFinally,\nAs always, please feel free to share this letter with anyone you think might be interested. I will be doing as much as I can to offer assistance and advice over the coming months and represent the constituency in Parliament; please do not hesitate to contact me if you think I can help.",

On 13th December, they booked fourteen twin-rooms for homeless people to stay at the Royal Hotel in Hull from 24th to 26th December, crowd funded by the generosity of Hull’s people. The hotel was fully aware that the rooms would be used by homeless people at the time of booking. Carl Simpson from Raise the Roof believes that it is now too late to find alternative accommodation for the guests.\nCommenting, Emma said ‘I am sure that everyone who has heard this story can imagine what a welcome and luxurious treat this would have been for the twenty-eight homeless people. I am extremely disappointed that these rooms were cancelled at such late notice and that no reason was given. Instead of such a lovely Christmas treat in a hotel, these people will find themselves sleeping on the streets. Christmas is meant to be the season of goodwill and I would urge the hotel to reverse its decision and honour the original booking.”\nA copy of Emma’s full letter can be seen below.",

These cuts are now undeniably affecting front-line teaching.\nThe latest School Cuts research – drawn solely from Government figures – shows that staff numbers in secondary schools have fallen by 15,000 between 2014/15 and 2016/17 despite having 31,000 more pupils to teach. This equates to an average loss of 5.5 staff members in each school since 2015; in practical terms this means 2.4 fewer classroom teachers, 1.6 fewer teaching assistants and 1.5 fewer support staff.\nThe cuts to front-line teaching posts are happening at a time when pupil-to-classroom teacher ratios are rising, which means bigger classes and less individual attention for children.\nThese average figures also mask significant regional variation. Despite the Government’s claims to be concerned about underfunded areas, some of the largest staffing cuts are in the areas with the lowest average funding per pupil such as: Reading, Isle of Wight, Central Bedfordshire, East Riding of Yorkshire, York, Derby and Milton Keynes.\nThe introduction of the National Funding Formula can’t solve this problem unless the funding cuts are reversed and significant extra resources included for underfunded schools. Four of the five worst hit local authorities – Middlesbrough, Reading, Isle of Wight, Doncaster – face further budget cuts over the next two years, even after taking into account any gains predicted by the Department for Education from its new funding formula. This will inevitably put even more pressure on staff numbers.\nThe situation is likely to get even worse, as it’s predicted that 17,942 (nine out of ten) primary and secondary schools in England and Wales will be hit by a real-terms cut in funding per pupil between 2015-19.",

I will then be participating in a debate on funding for further education colleges. Despite the fact that education is compulsory for 16-18 year olds, students lose about 25% of their funding after the age of 16. On top of this, FE colleges have seen a disproportionate cut in funding when compared to other education bodies with an average funding cut of 30%. I will be arguing that colleges need more money and should be funded on the same basis as 11-16 education.\nLater in the day, the Prime Minister will be making a statement to Parliament about what her plan is with regards to Brexit following her overwhelming defeat in the House of Commons last Tuesday. With MPs from across parties turning against her deal, it will be interesting to see what her plan will be for the next steps. As with other Brexit related statements, I am not able to speak in the House of Commons due to my roll in Labour’s Brexit team but I sincerely hope that she decides to act in the national interest, rather than her own party’s narrow interest and envisage releasing a comment after her statement to detail my thoughts on it. I will also be raising the issue of police cuts with the Home Secretary during Question Time.\nTuesday\nOn Tuesday, I will be attending the Education Select Committee. This week’s session will be returning to our enquiry on Special Educational Needs and Disabilities. In the afternoon, I will be chairing a meeting of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Oracy to plan an enquiry into the teaching of speaking and listening in schools. We envisage that the enquiry will take evidence from a range of witnesses and will help to produce a report. I will then be campaigning for the recommendations of that report to be taken up by the Government.\nWednesday\nOn Wednesday, I will be attending a meeting about isolation rooms. I am deeply concerned that schools are using isolation rooms as a form of unregistered exclusion for pupils for extended periods of time, thereby severely harming their education. I will be meeting with Dr Paul Williams MP and a range of experts from the education sector to do discuss how we can investigate this issue further and to plan next steps.

And the very least they deserve is a safe and decent home.\nToo often over the past 14 years, forces families in Yorkshire and the Humber were let down as the Tory government failed to invest in their housing. And this goes back further. In 1996 the Conservative Government under John Major sold off our military housing in one of the worst privatisation deals imaginable – selling off armed forces married quarters and renting them back at taxpayers’ expense.\nBy the time Labour entered Government, these rental payments had hit £600,000 a day, with homes run\ndown and left to rot. Private investors cashed in while families lost out.\nSo after six months in office, we announced the landmark buy-back of 36,000 homes, bringing forces’\nfamily housing into public ownership where they belong.\nOur Labour Government is prepared to step in when our national interest is at stake – just as we’ve done with British Steel. And our historic deal on military homes gives us the opportunity to stop the rot and start the renewal of an estate run down over decades. Bringing real benefits to families across Yorkshire and the Humber.\nOur historic deal means we can kick-start change with a new Consumer Charter for forces families –\nannounced.\nWe will deliver the common-sense standards for military homes that any of us should expect. Tougher\nrequirements so that homes are clean and functional when families move in, reliable repairs when things\ngo wrong, named housing officers to help, an end to rules that ban families personalising and improving\ntheir homes, and a new, simpler complaints process to sort out problems.\nThese are the basics on which forces families have been failed for years but where we will now act, with changes in place by the one-year anniversary of these homes being bought back.\nWe are a Government that is delivering for defence and for our Armed Forces. We are increasing defence\nspending and using that money to back the brave service men and women who keep our nation safe.\nLabour will renew the contract with those who serve and boost our national security as the foundation of our plan for change",
  "https_www_emmahardy_org_uk_/https_www_emmahardy_org_uk_2018_04_08_the-future-of-school-accountability/content_302.html": "The system for holding our schools to account is broken – and it’s breaking both our children and our teachers.\nDespite all the rhetoric about increased power and choice for parents, their role and influence has been diminished. There has been little improvement in the educational outcomes for children leaving school since 2010 and the only things that have dramatically risen in that time are teachers’ workloads, cases of children’s mental health problems and the number of children living in poverty.\nIncreasing numbers of children are being home schooled. There are worries that this is because schools are moving supposedly low-achieving children on for the sake of the exam league tables – a practice known as “off-rolling” – or because parents refuse to allow their children to be exposed to modern day state education.\nMany of our children face a limited educational diet because schools solely focus on English and maths in their fight to avoid being put into special measures. Time that used to be available for other subjects is swallowed up with extra maths or English ‘boosters’ or ‘interventions’, so inevitably other subjects suffer.\nThe behaviour policies set by some chains and schools are also under scrutiny, with some questioning whether they illegally damage the rights of children. The Children’s Commissioner had to intervene and write to the previous Secretary of State to ask her to remind schools that their behaviour policies should not violate the rights of children. Social mobility, if it ever existed, has stalled and now some – even those appointed by the government – are turning to eugenics to excuse why some children fail to achieve.\nTo illustrate just one example of how our flawed accountability system has unintended consequences and drives unwanted behaviour I want to focus on school attendance.\nSchools Minister Nick Gibb has repeatedly stated that: “Even one day missed from school without very good reason is one too many” and when launching the change to school attendance his ‘behaviour tsar’ Charlie Taylor said: “This is why good primary schools take a zero tolerance approach to poor attendance from the very start of school life.” (https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-data-highlights-true-picture-of-school-absence)\nOfsted says for a school to be ‘outstanding’:\n“Pupils value their education and rarely miss a day at school. No groups of pupils are disadvantaged by low attendance. The attendance of pupils who have previously had exceptionally high rates of absence is rising quickly towards the national average.”\nBut the unintended consequences of these well-meaning statements can provoke real concern among parents: witness the thousands who signed a petition protesting against the East Sussex County Council school attendance campaign, a campaign they called ‘aggressive’ and ‘offensive’.\nA Facebook post from a parent explaining why she wouldn’t let her child collect their attendance award was viewed and shared over four million times and sparked a debate about the fairness of such policies, (see photo).\nI was a primary teacher for 11 years and attendance awards were just part of school life. But a recent visit from a constituent showed just how problematic they can be for some who cannot avoid missing school. This constituent was a parent of a child who had developed significant mental health problems and extreme anxiety. She had become very ill and was finding it impossible to attend school. The parent believed that the school were more focused on her child’s attendance than her welfare.\nDuring this difficult time the parent was seeking support from CAMHS, whilst facing the obvious delays in getting an appointment. The pressure from the school to force her child to go to school was fuelling her child’s anxiety and it was only when her child’s hair started to fall out that the school “backed off.” The parent was going to be fined for her daughter’s lack of attendance but luckily the judge in the case had some common sense.\nWhen the parent tried to get her child into a different school, following a mental health diagnosis, the head of year called her into the school to set targets for her child’s attendance. This school knew that the child had a mental health condition and that she had been out of school for months but still prioritised her attendance over her health.\nThe child never returned to school. The targets for attendance set back her recovery and her parent instead sent her to the local 14-16 college.\nThe attendance issue is not an isolated example. Our accountability regime means pupils are losing out in many ways: Fewer children are studying music, some pupils are not allowed to choose subjects they are interested in if the school doesn’t believe they will get the top grades, while less time is being spent on sport despite the epidemic in childhood obesity.\nThe only way we will get the broad and balanced curriculum we need, make every child matter again and remove the fear that permeates every aspect of school life, is with a radical overhaul of our toxic accountability regime.\nSchools should of course be held to account. But the current set-up, with its focus on centralised – and often arbitrary – targets that is distorting our whole educational system.\n(This is a copy of the article I wrote for the Fabian magazine)",

They had previously been receiving monthly infusion therapy. Nearly 90 patients are affected by this decision.\nLast week, Emma raised the issue with Theresa May during Prime Minister’s Questions. In the exchange, Emma told the Prime Minister of the heart breaking stories of the constituents who had come to see her – some of whom claimed to be considering suicide – before asking the Prime Minister to personally intervene. She stated that cuts to the NHS were leading Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) to have to ration the range of treatments they are providing to patients.\nThe Prime Minister’s response did not engage with the situation and denied that funding cuts to the NHS have led to the decision by Hull and East Riding CCGs. Diana, Karl and Emma are writing to the Prime Minister to give her a chance to reconsider becoming personally involved. In addition to this, they are pursuing other options such as writing to Hull and East Riding CCGs and NHS England and making representations on behalf of individual constituents to these bodies.\nEmma contacted the other Members of Parliament for East Yorkshire to ask them to sign the letter but did not receive a single positive response.\nNICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) guidelines have not changed on the drug since funding was granted for these patients to receive pain infusion treatment. In some areas, such as Lincoln, the CCG is actively promoting the use of pain infusion therapy.\nCommenting on the letter, Diana said: “We appreciate that the Prime Minister may not have had all the facts available to her when she answered Emma’s question but this is an issue that is too important to too many people living in Hull and East Yorkshire. It’s really important that Theresa May looks again at our request to contact the CCGs and personally intervenes in the issue.”\nKarl said: “It’s clear that this decision has been made for financial reasons because of the cost pressure that the NHS has been facing. Diana, Emma and I are really concerned about the real, human effect that these funding decisions are having on the patients who rely on this treatment to let them live a quality life. The Prime Minister must reconsider her answer from last week and intervene personally to make sure that CCGs don’t have to ration treatments like this.”\nEmma said: “I recently met with a constituent who has informed me that she was was receiving pain infusions to help her with her 10 spinal fractures, these infusions are giving her the opportunity to enjoy real quality of life and she is so worried about what she will do without them. That’s why we’re calling on the Prime Minister to personally intervene, encourage the CCGs to review their decisions and ensure that these patients receive the treatment they need to live a quality life.”",
  "https_www_emmahardy_org_uk_/https_www_emmahardy_org_uk_2018_11_27_parents-with-send-children/content_411.html": "Over the last few weeks, I’ve spoken on a number of occasions about the issues that parents with children who have special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) face in trying to get support through an educational health and care plan (EHCP).\nI always like to keep my constituents and the educational community up to date with what I am doing so I have put videos of many of these occasions onto social media. I was overwhelmed by the number of people who responded to my post, many of them telling their stories about trying to navigate the system to get their children an EHCP and then to get the resources promised in the EHCP. These stories are harrowing, upsetting and a better critique of the system than anything that I or any other MP could ever make. I want to share some of those stories with you today.\nAmanda tells us that there are problems at every point at the system- poor accountability, lack of funding, lack of appropriate provision, lack of knowledge around the legislation, lack of knowledge around SEN itself and individual needs, lack of authority to enforce the right things, poor curriculum and withdrawal of more SEN friendly curriculum subjects with too much focus on school performance and grades rather than individual outcomes and also the increase in the size of education settings!\nSarah went further and said that she had no idea what part of the system she was fighting.\nSarah said that she had to fight the school to do the referral for an EHCP before they permanently excluded him. Then she had to fight for enhanced provision because he son kept getting turned down at panel but his draft EHCP was rejected from multiple schools stating they couldn’t meet need meaning that he basically missed a whole year of school because of it all.\nAnd the cost of getting an EHCP in place is prohibitively expensive, Elizabeth said that she had been forced to fund independent assessments due to failure of their local authority to complete the same. They have already spent £5000 on independent assessments this year and while they have received some support from family, it is not a sustainable situation. Sharon, meanwhile, spent £7,500 on private assessments and employed an advocate to help them navigate the exceptionally complex system. She says that the local authority pushed them all the way to Tribunal before conceding in the corridor just before the tribunal started, incurring more costs for her and her husband as they then had to pay for their witnesses and advocate’s attendance.\nBut even after all the effort of getting an EHCP, the battle isn’t over, and many parents struggle to get the agreed support actually put in place. Kelly’s son’s main priority under his EHCP is his speech disorder but could not get support for his condition and she had to get help from a local authority intervention officer before getting any kind of support.\nThis system is failing our young people. Marianne’s daughter went from primary school where she attained three ‘6s’ in her SATs to a situation where she was failing English and not achieving in her other GCSEs. I believe that this is partly because our schools do not have the funding they need to put the resources in place to fulfil her EHCP\nDeborah’s son has an auditory processing disorder and is severely dyslexic. She says that he was very well supported in junior school but when he got to secondary school, that support was taken away. The school claims that nothing came up from the junior school and Deborah’s son’s behaviour began to deteriorate. In year 10, he was expelled. Leigh argues that this is even more true as the child moves into Further Education. This has led many parents, like Tina who fears her son is likely to end up in a Pupil Referral Unit, to be stuck in a constant cycle of moving their children from school to school.\nOur education select committee is in the middle of an enquiry into SEND funding and are yet to make recommendations, but it is already clear that something must change. Labour have promised to deliver a strategy for children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) based on inclusivity which is so desperately needed.",
  "https_www_emmahardy_org_uk_/https_www_emmahardy_org_uk_2022_03_31_emma-hardy-mps-newsletter-march-2022/content_387.html": "Ukraine\nI have been proud of the response of our local organisations to the suffering of the Ukrainian people due to Putin’s unprovoked war. From Hull4Heroes to UNISON, people have stepped up to the plate to do whatever they can to help. It is estimated that 4 million refugees have now left Ukraine for Europe. Over 200,000 households in the UK have offered a place to Ukrainian refugees, nearly all of whom are women and children. However, the Government have admitted this week that only 1 in 100 of those offers has been taken up. This is disappointing and I will continue to push for more in Parliament.\nWork Hull, Work Happy\nTwo years ago, very few people had heard of Zoom and Teams, much less used them. Now they are an every day part of many people’s lives. Remote working has opened up new possibilities and I want to make sure the people of Hull and its businesses benefit from them. Although we learnt during the pandemic that remote working is no barrier to productivity there were downsides. Not everyone has the space in their home or access to all the facilities of a conventional office. Isolation was also a problem for some. In response to this companies are now offering office space for individuals, and “hot desking” and “co-working” have become the new buzzwords.\nI launched the Work Hull, Work Happy project this month to connect workers with local businesses offering flexible digital office space, and to promote Hull as a the remote-working capital of the UK. We have the best network of high-speed fibre broadband in the country, a relatively low cost of living and housing and a top university. The launch was a great success and was attended by representatives of key businesses from across the region along with Rachel Reeves, the Shadow Chancellor.\nWhether you have lived in Hull all your life, come here to study, want to down-size, or are a business looking to recruit the talent you need, Work Hull Work Happy wants to change the way people think about what’s possible in the city. You can find out more here https://www.workhull.com/\nThe Spring Statement and the Poverty Premium\nThe cost of living crisis is on all of our minds at the moment and I was very disappointed that the Chancellor’s Spring Statement offered so little to those in work and nothing to those who aren’t.\nIt has brought what is known as the “Poverty Premium” to the attention of more people. When it was explained to me, I realised there were parts of it I had been aware of but hadn’t put it all together. Basically, the Poverty Premium is about how many day-to-day essentials cost more if you are hard-up. For example, if you’re income varies month to month and you can’t commit to direct debit for fuel bills you pay more. The same applies to pre-payment meter rates. If you have insecure income or a non-salaried job and need a loan or credit card, your interest rates are higher. Any time you can’t afford to pay up front – especially insurance – then instalments are always more expensive. This all adds up. A study by Fair by Design shows that some households in places like Hull face a poverty premium equivalent to 14 weeks of food shopping a year or £478. I have been supporting Fair by Design’s campaign in Parliament and as a member of the Treasury Select Committee. As the cost of living is rising quickly we need real action from Government and a fair deal for everyone.\nPension Credit\nThere are estimated to be 850,000 people eligible for Pension Credit who are not claiming it. Pension Credit can be claimed alongside the State Pension and private pensions and tops up income to a guaranteed minimum. It also gives access to a range of other benefits.\nAge UK has a step-by-step guide here: https://www.ageuk.org.uk/information-advice/money-legal/benefits-entitlements/pension-credit/\nOr you can call the Pension Credit claim line on 0800 99 1234 (textphone: 0800 169 0133). They can fill in the application over the phone.\nPlease share this with anyone you think might be eligible, it could make all the difference.\nButterfly City Week\nThe buckthorn give-away week at the end of February I talked about in the last newsletter went ahead and all 1,500 plants were taken, with demand exceeding supply, so we shall be looking to repeat it next year. Before then, Butterfly City hope to hold more events in the summer helping people to do more to encourage butterflies to thrive in our city.\nThe launch event at Chiltern Primary had to be postponed because of the storms. On the day it was rescheduled, Ed Miliband, the Shadow Secretary of State for Climate Change and Net Zero was due to be in Hull so I invited him along and he said yes. This time the sun was shining and Ed and I, along with Lynn Petrini the Mayor, had a lovely time talking to the children and helping them to plant the buckthorns in the school grounds.\nSupport for the Humber Rescue Boat\nAs a Hessle resident the foreshore is a great place to take my children for some fresh air and to enjoy the views of the bridge and the river. Occasionally, we might have the excitement of seeing the Humber Rescue Boat launched.\nIt is the busiest independent lifeboat in the United Kingdom, averaging 110 callouts a year and often working in co-ordination with Humberside Police and Hull Coastguard Rescue Team. Like all other lifeboats in this country, they rely on donations from the public to undertake their life-saving work. Until very recently, they had no national voice beyond that of constituency MPs.\nHowever, the National Independent Lifeboat Association (NILA) has now been founded, registered and approved by the Charity Commission and I am delighted to say that Humber Rescue has already become a member. I have written a letter to the Minister of Transport, Grant Schapps, in support of this new organisation and the work that Humber Rescue does. I also asked him to reinstate the Rescue Boat Grant Fund which was closed by Government in 2020 after running successfully for six years and providing vital funds for new equipment and estate.\nAnd Finally…\nAs always, let me know what you think to this newsletter, particularly if you’ve got something that I should talk about in future editions. If I’m your MP and you need to talk to me at any time, you can call my office on 01482 219211.\nLastly. If you know anyone else who might be interested in hearing from me, ask them to email contact@emmahardy.org.uk\nHave a great day everyone\nBest wishes\nEmma\nTwitter: @EmmaHardyMP\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/EmmaHardyHullWestandHessle\nWebsite: https://www.emmahardy.org.uk/",

The state of the bioethanol market at that point, along with the political inactivity of the government in not bringing forward the RTFO regulations, caused the Hull Plant to close. This decision had a significant impact on the 150 employees at Vivergo Fuels in Hull and 3000 jobs in the company’s supply chain.\nPressure from Emma led to the Minister meeting with Mark Chesworth and making the announcement in his letter to her this week.\nEmma said “I’m pleased that the Government has succumbed to the pressure that Vivergo and I have placed on him and announced a date when the Renewable Transport Fuels Obligation will be reviewed by Parliament. Vivergo provide high skilled, well paid jobs to our area and they should be commended for the way they acted to keep their employees in work while the plant was shut down. This announcement will hopefully go a long way to helping them restart the plant and put the future of their employees and businesses on a firmer footing.\n“That being said, the situation should never have been allowed to reach this point. It is completely unacceptable that the political inaction of this Conservative Government put 150 jobs and a company that has invested £400 million in the local economy at risk. This uncertainty was totally preventable and could have been mitigated massively if only the Government would have acted sooner.”",

This treatment was prescribed because it is the most effective treatment for their chronic pain management.\nEast Riding of Yorkshire Clinical Commissioning Group have informed these patients that the Funding Request Panel has found that there is now a lack of clinical evidence to support the use of this treatment and it will be immediately adjusted and withdrawn over the next twelve months.\nWithout this treatment, the constituents would be living in constant pain which effects the whole of their life. Their everyday activities would be seriously curtailed and simple tasks like sitting or sleeping would become intolerable causing them extreme distress.\nAlthough Intravenous Infusion is not normally funded as a matter of course by East Riding of Yorkshire Clinical Commissioning Group these patients have been receiving this treatment for several years because it has been accepted that they have exceptional clinical circumstances that justify them getting funding.\nAs part of the regular review of this funding these patients, through their specialist Pain Management Consultants, have had to provide a supporting management plan to the Individual Funding Request Panel explaining why their exceptional clinical circumstances merits them receiving funding to carry on with the Intravenous Infusion.\nEmma is specifically querying why the Funding Request Panel have previously accepted the supporting management plans submitted by the patient’s health care professionals. Yet on this occasion they have stated that the supporting management plans, prepared by the same health care professionals, does not justify these patients getting funding for ongoing treatment.\nEmma said: “I am very concerned about why so many patients are now having this treatment withdrawn and the repercussions it has on their quality of life, and I intend to query in Parliament this change in attitude to funding by NHS England with a view to getting an explanation as to the reasoning behind their rationale.\n“As well as raising this issue of why this group of patients should suddenly not become eligible for previously funded treatment in Parliament, I will be writing to The East Riding of Yorkshire Clinical Commissioning Group and NHS England about these constituents individually. The Government needs to let us have a debate on CCG Funding so that we can talk about how these cases are funding nationwide and that’s what I asked them for today. The response I received from the Minister showed no compassion and was just a series of figures but my constituents should rest assured that I’ll keep pushing the government on this until the issue has been resolved.”",

I go straight to the office with my luggage put the kettle on for a cuppa and start the day around 11am.\nI met with the TUC soon after to discuss how we can better facilitate people learning new skills, and furthering themselves in the workplace including having a ‘right to learn’. This would be a scheme where employers would allow time for employees to learn new skills relevant to their workplace, maybe management or a qualification which would allow them to be promoted. The benefits would be obvious for both employee and employer.\nA few phone calls, a meeting with the Parliamentary Labour Party and I left the office around 8pm.\nTuesday morning started at 8am by joining the PCS strike action outside parliament with Interserve workers to demand better work conditions, I was joined by lots of other Labour MPs showing our support.\nI was standing with the cleaners, porters and workers from the Foreign Office who are striking for better pay and rights.\nHopefully with a bit of pressure Interserve will relent.\nI then moved onto a APPG meeting with ITV, a quick hop to Safer Internet Day 2020 helping to improve the internet for our children and young ones before moving into the House of Commons to ask Boris Johnson about rail improvements in Hull.\nI am sure you agree with me when I say I don’t believe he treated the question with due amount of respect, and to be honest I’d be surprised if he even knows where Hull was. Seriously though, it is just not good enough to disregard such important issues. Hull needs more rail improvements to help with congestion and to improve our daily commutes.\nAfter this I moved on to the Apprenticeship Levy:\nThe Apprenticeship Levy debate was a great opportunity for me as a new Shadow Education Minister to make recommendations to the government to improve the current levy which is failing small medium enterprise’s (SME’s) and our young people.\nI then popped across to the Education Centre to see a school that had come all the way down from Hull to see me. The children were so lovely, thank you so much for the visit!\nWednesday started with a visit from a group that is working towards lowering the cost of assessing children’s needs through innovative digital solutions, allowing schools and colleges to quickly diagnose such conditions as dyslexia, dyspraxia etc. This would allow quicker adaption of more suitable teaching methods and improve pupils experiences in schools.\nThis was followed by a lovely interview with FE Week, in which we talked about my childhood, growing up and how I have come to the position I am today. It was a great wander down memory lane and brought up some wonderful stories from my past.\nA few more meetings later in the evening before I finished for the day.\nThursday I started with an interview for the Sunday Times which I’m looking forward to reading, this was my first interview for the Sunday Times. Should be a good read, hopefully!\nI followed this up by attending the days business questions in the House of Commons, a few more meetings before the second debate on apprenticeships, this time raised by my wonderful colleague Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi MP for Slough, the abridged version is below:\nThis was followed by a burst across the city to catch my train back home to Hull.\nFeeling a little more refreshed Friday I was back in the constituency office in the morning trying to decipher and analyse what the governments cabinet reshuffle was all about from last night. It seems that Boris Johnson is quite prepared to sack anyone that doesn’t bow to his command and promote others that are quite unproven as long as they do as he demands.\nAnyway, Friday consisted of me going out and about in my constituency talking to our community members, the council and also marking the essays for the A63/Princes Quay naming competition, this competition has seen some wonderful entries from schools and children across Hull and I am looking forward to the final results!!!\nSo that was the week that was.

The hardest hit schools in the area will see per pupil losses in funding of up to £573.\nAfter meeting with head teachers, Emma, Diana and Karl will be sending a joint submission to the Chancellor of the Exchequer in advance of his Budget statement to Parliament later this year. The submission will lobby the Treasury for the resources and investment needed for the communities of Kingston upon Hull and Hessle.\nEmma Hardy MP said\n“If this Conservative Government’s new National Funding Formula goes through as it currently is, the cuts to school budgets in Hull and Hessle will be devastating. School leaders will struggle to make ends meet and it will be the children and young people who lose out.\n“We will see larger class sizes, further narrowing of the curriculum and support for the most vulnerable children being reduced.

In theory, some employers could pay the extra 20 per cent to workers so that they remain on full wage. In practice, given the huge financial constraints companies are under, this seems unlikely.\nThe scheme will work by the government paying grants to the companies affected, who will then pass on the wages to workers.\nPayments will be backdated to March 1, which will mean companies can put workers back on the payroll if they have already taken steps to lay them off.\nIt is unlikely, however, to be able to pay out until the end of April and the Treasury is in the process of setting up a website where firms can apply. All the preliminary information on the scheme is here.\nCompanies with up to 250 staff will also be able to claim back the cost of paying workers’ statutory sick pay for up to two weeks of absence caused by coronavirus or self-isolation. The government is yet to clarify how companies can apply for this.\nIf you cannot work because of coronavirus, you’re unlikely to be able to get tested at this stage and GPs will not want to see you. However, you can now access a digital sick note without going to the doctor, which will be provided as evidence that a person has to self-isolate. People are being told to self-isolate either if they have symptoms themselves or live with someone who has them. The notes can be accessed here.\nLOSING YOUR JOB\nIf you’ve been made redundant from your company and they tell you it is because of the fact that it cannot afford to keep employing you because of damage to its business caused by the coronavirus pandemic, you have a number of rights and expectations about how much money you’ll receive.\nYou’ll be entitled to a statutory payout if you’re an employee and you’ve been working at your current employer for two years or more. According to the law, this payout will be half a week’s pay for each year you were under the age of 22, one week’s pay for each year you worked if you’re aged between 22 and 40, and one and a half week’s pay for each year you were 41 or older. Your weekly redundancy payout will be capped at £525 and the maximum statutory payout is £15,750. However, it is reasonably likely that your company will present you with a package that exceeds this; the vast majority have their own bespoke redundancy policies.\nIf you feel that coronavirus is not a truthful reason for laying you off and that you are actually being punished for taking time off or for something else, you could make a claim to an employment tribunal. However, you will have to make a claim within three months of your employment ending. If you’re on a zero-hours contract you can’t claim for unfair dismissal.\nIf you don’t feel your redundancy payout can sustain you — and if your employer hasn’t restored you to the payroll after last Friday’s government wage payment (see above), you could be eligible for benefits. universal credit is available for those who are unemployed, aged at least 18, and have less than £16,000 in savings. Universal credit is a new government welfare scheme which combines lots of benefits into a single monthly payment. The government has a comprehensive guide, including a benefits calculator here which will tell you everything you need to know.\nSELF-EMPLOYED WORKERS\nAt present self-employed workers such as musicians, taxi drivers and supply teachers aren’t going to benefit from rules paying employees 80 per cent of their wages.\nThe Treasury said it is considering greater provisions to help the UK’s five million self-employed workers, but for now, there are ways to access help.\nSick or self-isolating self-employed workers can access universal credit at the same rate as employees would claim statutory sick pay, £94.25 per week. Previously this was available from day four, but is now being made available from day one. The first step to claiming this is to get an isolation note from the NHS, which you can do here.\nThen, self-employed workers have to apply for new-style Employment Support Allowance by calling the universal redit helpline on 0800 328 5644, which is open between 8am and 6pm. They will ask you to fill out a claim form, which can be done by post or email, and looks like this.\nIt’s also much easier to claim universal credit because a cap to payments known as the minimum income floor — which effectively curtailed the benefits given to the low-earning self-employed — has been temporarily suspended. The amount you get depends on your circumstances, but the first step is to create a universal credit account and give some details about your income, savings and outgoings, which you can do here.\nThe July 2020 self-assessment tax payment deadline, which is paid by some self-assessment taxpayers who make advance payments on their bill, has been pushed back to January 2021. This means that those expected to pay some of their bill in July, will now be expected to do so in January. There will be no late payment penalties until this time and workers don’t need to do anything.\nLastly, any VAT bills from now until the end of June will be deferred until the end of the tax year, in April 2021. If you’ve missed an outstanding tax payment or think you might miss your next payment, HMRC urges people to contact its dedicated Covid-19 helpline on 0800 0159 559.\nYOUR HOME\nIf you own your own home and find yourself unable to pay the mortgage, you can apply for a payment holiday from your bank for three months. These holidays will be made available to any homeowner concerned about their ability to meet repayments due to a loss of work or other circumstances.\nYou won’t have to go through any kind of means-test, and you won’t need to provide evidence you’ve been affected by the coronavirus crisis — in effect, you’ll be able to self-certify.\nHowever, whether or not you apply for such a holiday must still be a careful decision, because it will cost you extra in the long-term. You’ll still owe the bank the same capital amount as you do now but interest will continue to accrue while you stop payments.\nThis means that, ultimately, it will take you longer and cost you a little more to clear your mortgage. On a £500,000 mortgage over 25 years, at a rate of 3 per cent, that would add almost £3,000 to your overall debt. The longer you are through your mortgage term, and the lower interest rate you have, the less it will be.\nLenders will not charge you any additional set-up fees to authorise a payment holiday.\nAfter three months, your lender will contact you to assess your circumstances and agree on a manageable way for you to make up the deferred payments. Lenders will provide a range of options, which may include extending your mortgage term or altering your monthly payments if it’s affordable to do so.\nYou’ll need to contact your bank or building society directly to arrange a holiday, but there have been some teething problems. With phone lines flooded, many lenders have offered an online form where you can apply. Barclays and HSBC have yet to offer these. Barclays has yet to extend its mortgage repayment facility to landlords, although it stresses it is “working on an appropriate solution”. The key thing is to have patience.\nYOUR RENTAL HOME\nUnder emergency rules, private landlords are banned from beginning eviction proceedings for the next three months, giving private renters some breathing space.\nThe same applies to housing associations, which have promised not to evict tenants who are ill and fall behind on rent payments.\nEven if your landlord has already applied to give you notice, they won’t be able to take you to court to begin eviction proceedings for the next three months.\nCommunication is key. Speak to your landlord to explain you might struggle to pay your rent.\nLandlords can apply for a mortgage holiday if they hold a buy-to-let mortgage, in the same arrangement as homeowners (see above). The government has urged tenants and landlords to work together, for example to agree a rent holiday or repayment plan once the financial climate has improved. If possible, get any agreements in writing.\nIf you want to leave rented accommodation as soon as possible (for example because you want to reduce your outgoings and move in with someone else) and have signed a fixed-term contract, it will only be possible to leave early by negotiating this with your landlord.\nCheck your rental agreement, as 12-month assured shorthold tenancies usually include a six-month break clause, for either landlord or tenant to exit the agreement, so it may be possible to leave earlier than you might think.\nThe government has promised to pay 30 per cent of average rents in your area. To do this, renters must apply for the Local Housing Allowance, a type of housing benefit for private renters, which is administered by local authorities. Contact your local authority for details on how to claim.\nThe Valuation Office has an online form for working out Local Housing Allowance rates here. If you’re renting a property that costs above average for the area, be aware that the benefit might cover less than 30 per cent of your actual rent.\nYOUR OTHER FINANCES\nIf you’re struggling to repay credit card or personal loan debts, the first step is to contact the company you have the debt with, since many are offering payment holidays or waiving late payment charges for those financially affected by coronavirus.\nThis isn’t an automatic right, but will be up to the bank or financial firm to look at your circumstances and decide whether it should step in to help.\nBarclays, for example, has promised mortgage holidays but says personal loan holidays are to be decided on a case-by-case basis.\nSantander says it will consider extending people’s borrowing if they contact the bank. Before you contact your provider, gather plenty of information to explain why your income has been hit by Covid-19, such as if you have been unable to work. Be aware that many lenders are busy with requests from other customers, so it may take longer to get through to email and online forms, so calling is probably the best way to get advice quickly.\nIf you have money locked away in a fixed-rate bond, some savings providers have relaxed the normally tough rules on accessing money early. This means you may not have to pay a penalty to get the money out.\nAgain, contact the firm you hold an account with and explain your situation, because technically they can still stick to the terms and conditions of the account, which might impose withdrawal penalties or ban any access to cash before the fixed term ends.\nWHAT TO CLAIM IF YOU’RE WORKING FROM HOME\nMillions of people are working from home for the first time. If you have to work from home regularly your company can pay you a modest tax-free homeworking allowance, which should be added directly to your wages.\nThis is designed to cover costs such as higher gas and electricity bills and is due to increase from £4 a week to £6 on April 6. It should compensate for any extra spending on energy as a result of the coronavirus outbreak.\nIf you can prove that you have spent more than this, claim back the outlay on expenses. Your company would usually facilitate your home-working by providing tools you don’t have such as laptops, but it doesn’t by law have to give you anything.\nIf you’re a full-time employee and you need to buy things that could help you set up your home office, you could get back some of your money as employment expenses via a P87 form. You can use a P87 if you’re not filling in a self-assessment form, if you are an employee and you have spent your own money on expenses that have not been reimbursed, and if your allowable employment expenses are less than £2,500 for the tax year (any more and you will have to fill in a full return).\nHMRC guidance says that anyone can claim tax relief via this form for expenses that are incurred “wholly, exclusively and necessarily” in the performance of their role. This is where it can get tricky, as proving you only use laptops, cars or internet broadband connections solely for work purposes would be extremely difficult. Items such as a desk chair should be acceptable, along with other office furniture and stationery, provided you can convince HMRC they were necessary for you to do your job properly and not bought for your own convenience or for other personal reasons.\nThe amount of tax relief you receive will depend on your income-tax rate. For example, if you are a basic-rate taxpayer claiming relief on £1,000 of allowable expenses, you will receive £200 — that is, 20 per cent of £1,000.\nThe rules on timing for P87 forms are nowhere near as rigid as tax returns. You have four years from the end of the tax year to make a claim: so, for 2019-20, you must make a claim by April 5, 2024. You can find the form here.\nIf your claim is successful, HMRC will pay what it owes you by cheque or it will adjust your tax code and pay you via your wages. You will not have to submit any receipts with the P87, but keep them anyway, as HMRC may want to check them.\nHERE IS THE LINK TO THE FULL ARTICLE: The Times Money Mentor\nTo note:\nThe support from the government doesn’t really cover those employed on a zero-hours contract that are unable to get work because their usual employer has closed (not because they have, or think they might have the virus). In this situation I think it is for people to apply for Universal Credit. However, remind them of the following:\n- They should claim the day after they receive their last pay from their previous employment (otherwise their pay will be included in their Universal Credit calculation and they will receive less)\n- If they are claiming old-style Child Tax Credits or Working Tax Credits, these will immediately stop as the claim for Universal Credit is being processed. This will no doubt place the person in a precarious financial position therefore they need to weigh up whether they can feasibly do it or not. Applying for Universal Credit may also mean that they are entitled to less overall going forward.\n- To my knowledge there is still a 5-week wait for the first Universal Credit payment.\nThe second and third bullet points can be alleviated by applying for a Universal Credit Advance although this does need to be paid back within 12 months.\nwww.turn2us.org.uk is a really good website for benefits advice and there is a special Coronavirus section.\nI hope you can find some help in this article\nEmma x",

We hoped to highlight an issue that we all felt that had been overlooked and undervalued for too long – the need for children to develop the ability to articulate themselves and become confident communicators.\nThere was a feeling that the narrowing of the curriculum through SATS in primary schools had seen oracy reduced to the role of bystander. Classrooms were growing silent and being commended by some for doing so. The purpose of the Inquiry was to explore the reality of the teaching and status of oracy in English schools and produce a report which would detail a way forward.\nThe past few years have seen growing division in our country and improved oracy skills, learning to disagree without being disagreeable, is needed more than ever.\nIt couldn’t be more important for us to act now. The evidence we received on the impact of Covid-19 school closures on children’s spoken language skills paints a stark picture, with the already persistent language gap between disadvantaged students and their peers further exacerbated across all ages.\nThe response to the Inquiry was fantastic. We heard from leading academics, international experts, key education influencers and decision makers, school leaders, hundreds of teachers and most importantly children and young people. We examined over 130 pieces of written evidence, heard five oral evidence sessions, held roundtables, public events, case studies and polling. And the message has been clear.\nOracy in education matters. We are not doing it well enough and we need to do better, starting now.\nWe need an enduring shift towards oracy in educational culture and values, and in policy and practice. When we teach children how to speak; when we provide real opportunities for discussion, debate and a sharing of voice, children’s attainment and life chances can be improved.\nTo do this we must begin by acknowledging that despite what is included in the current National Curriculum on speaking and listening, oracy education is not being consistently or comprehensively provided in our schools – for some children, school is their only chance to develop these skills. Less than half (46%) of primary teachers and a quarter (23%) or secondary teachers reported being confident in their understanding of the ‘spoken language’ requirements outlined in the National Curriculum. Only 14% of classroom teachers felt that their school was meeting the spoken language requirements of the National Curriculum to a ‘great extent’.\nLockdown showed us the need we all have for human interaction; we are social beings who need a connection with others. Oracy is particularly important for young people’s social development and wellbeing and the majority of teachers want and understand this. 80% of headteachers and 62% of classroom teachers said oracy should be treated as essential now schools have reopened. However, 26% of classroom teachers said oracy is not a priority in their school and only 8% of teachers strongly agree that their school has a consistent approach to oracy. This chimes with my experience as a former primary school teacher; how the pressures, challenges, incentives and competing priorities schools face can act as barriers to focusing on what we, as teachers, know is most important.\nBut some schools and teachers are making it happen. It was a privilege to hear teachers describe to the inquiry their hopes and ambitions for the children and young people they serve; the obstacles and challenges those young people face and the impact that oracy education was having on their success both in school and in their life beyond the school gates.\nThe work of producing the report has left us in no doubt that oracy education cannot be viewed as a “nice to have,” something relegated to a short-lived project or initiative, or an extracurricular opportunity for a self-selecting few.\nThe report presents its case in great detail and its recommendations include: investing in a teachers’ professional development at every stage; equipping and empowering teachers and schools to provide sustained, and comprehensive, high-quality oracy education; including oracy as part of funded policy initiatives such as opportunity areas and English hubs; ensuring that oracy is part of any recovery or ‘catch up’ investment; and the return of an oral language component as a part of the grading at GCSE level.\nOracy education is a moral imperative and a matter of social equity. Just as talk is the heart of how we communicate, learn, discover, explore, express, interact, relate, empathise, create, collaborate and connect, so oracy must be at the heart of education.\nThe report and its recommendations aim to establish oracy as the golden thread running through a child’s education from beginning to end. Oracy is too important to miss out on especially for those young people that need it most.\nEmma Hardy is the Labour MP for Kingston upon Hull West and chair of the APPG on Oracy.",

Labour wanted to extend to every young person the options that wealthier families took for granted, with bigger initial payments for the children from the least well off backgrounds.\nUntil the Conservatives closed the scheme in January 2011, the Labour Government invested at least £250 in a fund that only the beneficiary can access, and only when they turn 18. The money went into an account their parents could open with a financial services provider, using a voucher sent out by the government – and for children whose parents didn’t use their voucher, the Government set up an account for them.\nParents and others could pay more money into the account too, subject to an annual cap. In Wales, the Welsh Labour Government put extra money in when children reached primary school age. Children with disabilities were entitled to extra annual payments into their Trust Fund from the Government, because of the extra needs young adults with disabilities face.\nAround 55,000 children every month will come of age and benefit from the scheme, from now until January 2029, but only if they know about the scheme and know where their account is.\nEmma Hardy MP, said:\n“A generation ago, a Labour government looked ahead to the future of today’s young adults. People turning 18 today and for years to come will be the beneficiaries of their foresight and Labour’s determination to make lives better and society fairer.\n“The contrast with the mishandling of young people’s futures – on public health, on schools, on exams, on jobs – by the current government in Westminster could not be starker.\nFor every 18-year-old, this is the difference a Labour government makes in spreading power and opportunity in our society. Labour’s generation, the school-leavers for whose futures the last Labour government planned, meanwhile has been let down by a Tory government which doesn’t do its homework.”",

Emma and Cllr Mancey will now meet with Highways England on the 28th November to press for no more slippage on this vital scheme.\nCommenting on the announcement, Emma said:\n“This development is key to the continued economic growth of the Hull and Humber region and so this news is welcomed. Hull has seen vast economic investment since it gained City of Culture status and Siemens built its green energy hub in the city. With regional devolution, Hull will also continue to grow as a port which will be crucial in the development of this region and the country.\n“The investment into the Castle Street Development will more than pay for itself and ensure Hull continues to grow and build the economy of the United Kingdom.\n“After I met with Chris Grayling last week to press him on this issue, It is also fantastic to hear that the building of a permanent bridge has been brought forward as this will definitely help alleviate some of the traffic and health and safety problems. However there has been no announcement or confirmation on whether the rest of the project will be delayed further. This is something I asked the Government about at our meeting last week.\n“While the announcement that the bridge has been brought forward is a major step in the delivery of this essential improvement it is by no means the end of the road and I will continue to press both the Government and Highways England to ensure that they stick to the plans they’ve laid out today and the programme for the remainder of the main scheme they previously committed to.”\nCouncillor Mancey, commenting on behalf of Hull City Council said:\n“After years of lobbying successive Secretaries of State I am relieved that we have, at last, gained a commitment to the timetable for the construction of the footbridge. This is an essential part of the infrastructure connecting the city centre to the newly emerging and highly successful regeneration of the fruit Market. It is disappointing that it has taken so long for the government to acknowledge the importance of this bridge but at least we now have a firm date for construction to commence. We must now maintain the pressure on Highways England and the Secretary of State to deliver the rest of the scheme without further delay.”",

Such a move would entitle apprentices to incentives such as cheaper transport and free prescriptions. These are already available for young people still at school or college until age 19.\nApprentices, and especially younger apprentices, have typically been paid much less than those who are not in apprenticeships. The minimum wage for apprentices is £3.50 while the minimum wage is £7.05 and the Government’s living wage- which is paid only to those over 25- is £7.83.\nYet despite the difference in minimum wages, apprentices receive no discount on public transport, prescriptions or any other service.\nEmma’s question was inspired after speaking to her constituent, Chloe who is on an apprenticeship. Chloe visits college for two days a week and pays a full train fare. She also needs to pay full prescription fees.\nSpeaking after Education Questions, Emma said: “Many people on apprenticeships spend some time in college learning their trade but they have absolutely none of the benefits available to other people in education.\n“One of the reasons given by the government for allowing a lower wage for apprentices is because they are meant to be a period of training for those involved. The disparity between these two positions is very confusing. Why is it a period of training for the purpose of wages but not for the additional benefits that come from being classified? Constituents should rest assured that I will be doing everything I can to push this issue and make sure the government ends the disparity.”",

  "https_www_emmahardy_org_uk_/https_www_emmahardy_org_uk_2025_04_04_community-newsletter-march-2025/content_41.html": "Dear Friend,\nI hope this finds you well and that you’re finding a moment to enjoy the beautiful Spring days we’ve been blessed with recently.\nA wonderful sign of innovation in our area was seeing the huge ship Wind Peak docked at the Siemens factory loading up with blades and towers to take out to the new wind farms in the North Sea. These blades are now recyclable, which is an industry first and another step forward to a truly Green economy.\nSpring Statement Brings Hope Amid Challenges\nEven with the sunny weather, I know many people feel uneasy about the global situation. That’s why I’m relieved the government is prioritising security with an additional £2.2 billion in defence spending. Protecting citizens is a fundamental responsibility, but there’s still more to do.\nThe Spring Statement also brought encouraging news—our country is turning a corner. While growth may slow this year, next year’s forecast has been revised upward. The Planning and Infrastructure Bill will play a key role in this progress, reforming planning rules to unlock potential and get our country building again. From rail tracks to flood defences, we urgently need to repair and renew.\nI’m pleased to see wages rising faster than the cost of living and NHS waiting lists falling for five months in a row. We’re also improving military housing and investing in public services to support those who serve our country.\nHowever, I understand that welfare changes are causing a real worry for some people and so I want to be clear that those unable to work will always have support, and without having to face degrading reassessments – a promise that was repeated by the Prime Minister this week. For those who can work, we’re committed to helping them find the right opportunities through initiatives like the “right to try,” where individuals can explore work without risking their benefits, and further investment in supporting and helping people.\nI also want to reassure you all that this Labour government is committed to reducing child poverty, and we will soon publish details from the Child Poverty Taskforce recommendations. Our commitment is unwavering, and every department is exploring additional steps we can take. Because we haven’t yet published the taskforce’s recommendations, their actions weren’t reflected in the recent impact statement released with the Spring Statement. Of course, I will keep you updated.\nFinally, we’re making tough but necessary decisions to reduce Civil Servant costs by 15%, ensuring taxpayers’ money is spent wisely. A £3.4 billion transformation fund will help make public services more efficient and cost-effective in the long term.\nThere’s still work to do, but these steps show we’re moving in the right direction.\nHull and East Riding Chamber of Commerce Event Highlights Opportunities and Challenges\nOur region’s geography has always been key to its success, and once again it’s driving Hull and East Riding forward. With Net Zero initiatives on the horizon, we are perfectly positioned to benefit from offshore wind expansion, hydrogen gas development, new boiler technologies, and carbon capture and storage. These are HUGE opportunities for growth and prosperity.\nLast week, local businesses met with Rt Hon Ed Miliband to discuss exciting investment prospects for our area. Building on this momentum, I plan to host an “Investing In The Humber” event in parliament to showcase all that Hull and East Riding has to offer. This matters because getting this right will mean creating good, well-paid jobs, improving living standards, and boosting our local economy.\nHowever, businesses regularly raise concerns about obstacles like issues with the planning system and even water shortages. It’s shocking that these problems are still holding back growth, but we’re determined to tackle them. After all, more growth means more funding for essential services like the NHS, schools, and emergency responders—the things we all depend on.\nWith the right strategy, Hull and East Riding can lead the way in Net Zero innovation while strengthening our community and economy for years to come.\nBusinesses of the Month – Celebrating Local Gems\nThis month, I’ve been visiting some wonderful small businesses in Hull West and Haltemprice that truly showcase what makes our community special.\nGingers of Willerby\nThis charming dog-friendly café on Main Street, Willerby, is a must-visit. Their food is locally sourced, with meat from Gary Aldens Butchers in Hessle and excellent coffee from BlendingRoom on Boulevard. When I stopped by, I had a brilliant ham and salad sandwich—it was fantastic. Gingers also hosts themed evenings and quiz nights, so there’s always something fun going on – the next events are a Mediterranean evening on Friday April 11th and quiz night on Tuesday 17th.\nPlant & Paint on Humber Street\nIf you’re out enjoying the sunshine, take a stroll down Humber Street and pop into Plant & Paint, a gorgeous independent plant shop. They sell stunning indoor plants and accessories and regularly host workshops. Lara and Emma, the small but mighty team, are always busy helping the community—they’ve even supported Hull Butterfly City’s buckthorn giveaways.\nThe Norland in Hessle\nTo round off your day, why not stop by The Norland in Hessle? This friendly pub is at the heart of the local community. They host over-55s afternoons and weekly bingo sessions every Sunday. The team is welcoming, and it’s a favourite spot for locals to relax and catch up.\nThese fantastic businesses show the strength and spirit of our community, so let’s keep supporting them! Whether it’s grabbing a bite, shopping local, or enjoying an evening out, there’s something here for everyone.\nUpdate on Connexin Fibre Network Changes\nYou may have heard that Connexin’s fibre network in Hull and East Riding is being acquired by Cityfibre, including plans to expand the network.\nI’ve been reassured by Connexin that Cityfibre is fully aware of the ongoing trials with KCOM to agree on infrastructure sharing. This process is still on schedule, with KCOM aiming for a final agreement by June.\nLocal residents have raised concerns about the number of broadband poles in the area, and I know how relieved everyone was when the installation of new poles was paused. To make sure progress continues smoothly, I’ve written to the Cityfibre Chief Executive to confirm their commitment to these plans.\nI’ll stay closely involved to ensure that changes to our fibre network benefit the community. If you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to reach out!\nLabour Government Strikes Deal to Improve GP Services\nWhenever I talk to residents, one of the main concerns I hear is about NHS services and the difficulty of getting a doctor’s appointment. That’s why I’m so pleased to share that Your Labour government has reached a new agreement with GPs—the first since the pandemic. This deal, backed by an extra £889 million next year, marks real progress in rebuilding general practice.\nThe deal includes:\n• Online Appointment Booking: By October, all surgeries will offer online booking, putting an end to the stressful 8am scramble.\n• Family Doctor Relationships: Financial incentives will encourage continuity of care, bringing back the trusted relationship with a family doctor.\n• Cutting Red Tape: Nearly half of the current targets and measures will be removed, giving GPs more time to focus on patient care.\nCombined with 2 million extra appointments and falling waiting lists announced last month, this is another big step towards putting the NHS back on its feet. Labour is committed to delivering the improvements we all need.\nNew Program Brings Brighter Smiles to Local Schools\nExciting news for children’s dental health! A new initiative called Prevention/Access/Treatment (PAT) is helping kids in our community build strong, healthy smiles that last a lifetime. Launched by our Integrated Care Board (ICB), PAT is already making a difference at Chiltern Primary, Newington Academy, and Rokeby Park Primary.\nHere’s what the program offers:\n• Daily Tooth Brushing at School: Kids brush their teeth under supervision, learning good habits.\n• Twice-a-Year Dental Checks: Regular assessments help identify kids who need treatment, with care provided even if they don’t currently have a dentist.\n• Fluoride Varnish Treatments: A special varnish is applied during these checks to protect teeth.\nPAT is a fantastic example of smart planning and teamwork, improving children’s health while supporting local dental practices. This innovative program shows how a little creativity and dedication can bring big benefits to our community!\nCelebrating Inspirational Women in Hull West and Haltemprice\nThis March 8, we marked International Women’s Day by shining a spotlight on some of the incredible women who inspire and support our local community. Thank you to everyone who shared their nominations—here are just a few of the amazing women who make a real difference every day:\n• Hilary Hogan Moss: As Chair of the Hessle Waits carol singing group, Hilary plays a vital role in local events, working tirelessly to make Hessle a better place for families and residents.\n• Ashleigh Hirst: Co-founder of HEY Endo and Doreen’s, Ashleigh supports women across Hull while bravely managing her own struggles with endometriosis. Her hard work and dedication make her a true inspiration.\n• Margaret Carey: After 44 years of service at the Jobcentre and more than 20 years as a Cub leader, Margaret has also dedicated herself to supporting charities like Macmillan and Dove House. Her exceptional contributions were recognized with a BEM in the first King’s Birthday Honours.\n• Sally Smith: Leading the CHAT group, Sally provides vital support and encouragement to its members.\n• Courtney Wright: Always ready to lend a hand, Courtney helps residents with housing, benefits, social services, and more.\n• Helen Brewster: As Co-founder of HEY Endo, Helen works tirelessly to raise awareness of endometriosis and support women affected by the disease, despite facing her own challenges.\n• Dr. Barbara Guinn: A trailblazer in STEM, Dr. Guinn conducts groundbreaking research into endometriosis, improving the lives of so many in Hull and beyond.\n• Fiona Woodcock: Manager of Dove House in Hessle Square, Fiona dedicates countless unpaid hours to fundraising and organizing events for the hospice and local community.\n• Melanie Sumpton: Known for her kindness and dedication, Melanie made a big impact during her time as manager of the AGE UK shop in Hessle and is adored by many.\n• Suzanne Stone: At her local gym, Suzanne empowers individuals with disabilities to participate in classes, and she’s always there to help her neighbors in need.\nThese extraordinary women embody strength, compassion, and community spirit. Remember to thank the inspirational women in your own life—they truly make our community shine!\nHere’s to celebrating the women who make a difference every day!\nNew Charter Helps Workers with Endometriosis\nAshleigh and Helen, founders of HEY Endo, are making a huge impact with the launch of their Workplace Best Practice Charter. This fantastic initiative, created with Hull and District Trades Council, supports those with endometriosis by encouraging workplaces to be more understanding.\nTheir dedication is inspiring—what began as a simple idea over coffee is now helping people stay in work. Several major employers have already signed up, and with free training available, it’s easy for more to join.\nThanks to Ashleigh, Nel and Helen’s hard work, Hull and East Yorkshire are leading the way in supporting workers with endometriosis.\nMake Your Voice Heard on the Future of Our Water\nEarlier this month, Labour’s landmark Water Act became law, giving new powers to tackle pollution by banning unfair bonuses for water bosses and introducing criminal charges for those who break the rules. As part of our Plan for Change to clean up rivers, lakes, and seas, the Independent Water Commission has been set up to help shape a better, more sustainable water sector.\nThe Commission is calling for evidence, and they want to hear from anyone who cares about protecting and improving our water. This is your chance to share your ideas and concerns—after all, cleaner water benefits us all!\nThe Call for Evidence is open until 23 April, and your contributions will help the Commission make recommendations to the UK and Welsh Governments this summer. Together, we can ensure a brighter future for our water.\nLet’s seize this opportunity to make a difference!\nMayoral Election: A Chance for Change in Hull and East Riding\nOn Thursday 1st May, residents will vote for the first-ever mayor of the Hull and East Riding Combined Authority—a historic moment for our region. Labour’s candidate, Margaret Pinder, has set out a bold plan to deliver real change for local communities.\nMargaret’s vision includes creating new job opportunities through an apprenticeship scheme, improving access to GPs, and boosting regional connectivity with free travel to our stunning seaside towns. Her commitment to making Hull and East Yorkshire a better place for everyone is clear.\nThis election is a chance to shape the future of our area. A vote for Margaret Pinder on 1st May could bring the positive change our region deserves.\nYou can learn more about Margaret’s plans for our region here.\nRegister to vote here. Apply for a postal vote here. And remember to bring I.D!\nAnd finally…\nAs always, I’m here to support you.

  "https_www_emmahardy_org_uk_/https_www_emmahardy_org_uk_2017_07_05_isp-ipsum-dolor-sit-amet-consectetur-adipisicing/content_35.html": "Today, Labour asked an urgent question to the government on public sector pay.\nAt the moment- and for the last 7 years- the Conservative’s public sector pay cap means that wages for public sector workers like nurses, teachers and police officers have not been able to rise by more than 1% per year.\nInflation- which measures the way the cost of living goes up from one year to the next- has often been more than 1%. This means that public sector workers have, in effect, seen their pay been cut in the last few years. Research by the Office of Manpower Economics shows that since the pay cap was introduced, the average teacher has lost £3 an hour in pay while the average police officer has lost £2 every hour. This is obviously a significant chunk of the overall salary of Public Sector Workers.\nGiven the talk on the news recently about the disagreements in the Cabinet over the pay cap I was hopeful that the government may make some concessions. I was bitterly disappointed.\nNot only did Liz Truss, the Conservative Chief Secretary, to the Treasury tell us that the government would not move an inch on its policy, she attacked Labour for asking the question.\nThis is proof, if ever it were needed, that the Conservatives do not act in the interest of working people. But I do. I will continue to work hard for the people of Hull West and Hessle and have written to Liz Truss to reiterate my party’s calls to end the public sector pay cap. I look forward to her attacking Labour again in her response. Because, as the saying goes, if they are attacking you then you must be doing something right.",

This included the Build Back Better scheme which offers those whose homes have been damaged by flooding an additional £10,000 to make them more flood resilient.\nWe know all too well in Hull and East Yorkshire the devastation flooding can cause. In 2007 many people had to leave their home due to flood damage and I know that even once they’d returned home, there was a lot of anxiety about the possibility of it happening again. This scheme aims to alleviate some of that anxiety by making properties as flood resilient as possible.\nIt was a really positive conversation and I’ll continue to work with all insurance companies so we can protect as many homes from the devastating impact of flooding.",

  "https_www_emmahardy_org_uk_/https_www_emmahardy_org_uk_2023_05_12_may-2023-newsletter/content_215.html": "Dear Friend,\nI hope this finds you well. It’s back to work in Parliament for me after the local elections and the long Coronation weekend.\nNHS Dentists\nTop of my list is to try to improve the situation over access to NHS dentists. I know that this is not a problem restricted to Hull and Hessle, but an increasing number of constituents have been getting in touch with the same problems. Some of them are quite desperate and their stories are heartbreaking.\nOne problem is that we simply don’t have enough dentists in the area, so part of the solution would be a Dental School in Hull. It would bring other benefits beyond just more dentists and I have begun working closely with our other two Hull MPs, Diana Johnson and Karl Turner, on a how best to achieve this.\nAnother reason for the decline in NHS dentists is the inadequate dental contract the government is currently offering. There is an opportunity to tackle this locally through the new Humber and North Yorkshire Integrated Care Board and I am hoping they can be persuaded to trial an alternative funding system.\nI am also planning a Facebook Live event on the growing problem. I will share information on how to join and ask questions as soon as it has been finalised. I will also be conducting a survey so that everyone can share their experiences and I hope this will be a powerful part of the campaign.\nThere is no overnight solution to a crisis that has been 13 years in the making. It will be a long battle, but one that I am determined to win.\nLocal elections, doorstep conversations and voter I.D.\nI have been out and about the last few weeks supporting the local Labour candidates in the council elections, and it has been a great opportunity to talk to constituents and hear their hopes and concerns – and criticisms! – directly. The people of West Hull and Hessle are a great bunch and I do enjoy this part of my job.\nPeople are really feeling the rising costs of daily living and the message I heard over and over again is that the country needs a change. As the Conservatives lost more than 1,000 seats across England we are not alone in that feeling.\nI also spoke to a number of people who had either applied for I.D. and not received it in time, or simply hadn’t got around to it. I found this troubling.\nIt is worth remembering that a postal vote does not require photo I.D. and you can apply for one at any time. You will then be prepared for the next election, whether that is local or national. You need to be already registered to vote and to apply in writing. You can download the form to print out here, or request a form is posted to you for Hull here or East Riding here.\nAction following Derringham Residents meeting\nI’m really grateful for Sue from the Abbey Pub in Derringham, first for reaching out to me, and second for arranging the use of Priory Baptist Church for a resident’s meeting. Sue had got in touch over her concerns with the increase in anti-social behaviour and fly-tipping and it was clear to me that we needed to get everyone together. It was the first chance many residents had had to raise issues direct with their ward councillors which I found hugely disappointing to hear. I was pleased that Rich from Humberside Police and Luke from Renew attended the meeting as well.\nListening to those present, It was clear that austerity cuts to policing, youth services and probation were having a harmful effect on the community.\nFollowing the meeting I contacted West Hull Community Police Team, the Antisocial Behaviour Team at the council and the Neighbourhood Network. Lucy Kevan, the new police inspector for Hull West, responded with the news that PC Harrison is now in the process of setting up a group with the Neighbourhood Network for the ward and will be running a regular police surgery. They will be inviting the ASB Officer to these surgeries as well, and this will give the residents the opportunity to speak with them on a regular basis regarding any concerns they have.\nThe Council’s ASB Team have also got back to say they are keen to work with residents and are looking at making Coronation Road and the surrounding area a priority area for response.\nTo help address the effects of anti-social behaviour on people’s mental health, I contacted the charity Mind. They have offered to put on a group session for anyone who would benefit from talking about their experiences.\nCuts to BBC Radio Humberside\nI’m sure a lot of you will have heard that Burnsy will no longer be presenting his show on Radio Humberside and that Andy Comfort and Fiona Mills are also leaving. In fact, I understand that all Radio Humberside presenters were asked to reapply for their jobs and only one was successful.\nBurnsy is an award-winning broadcaster who held the local authorities and MPs to account, and he did so without fear or favour. Radio Humberside gives its listeners a voice, and I was always happy to appear to be questioned by Burnsy, Andy or Fiona because I knew I would be answering direct to the constituents of West Hull and Hessle.\nI secured an Urgent Question in Parliament when these cuts were first announced and then wrote to the Director General of the BBC with my concerns. This news confirms the worst of my fears: a haemorrhaging of talented local presenters with deep knowledge and connections to the region, the abandonment of a significant demographic of current listeners, and an effective end to high quality local radio.\nI have now drafted a further joint letter to the Director General, which has been co-signed by all the MPs in the Radio Humberside region.\nSupport for armed forces families\nRecently I met with two impressive young people called Elizabeth and Emily who discussed their ambition to set up an Armed Forces Champion in every school. Moving home – and so schools – can be a regular occurrence for children with a parent in the armed forces and they also experience pressures and challenges unique to them. Armed Forces Champions would welcome and support them through any transition issues which may arise, and be there with an understanding of their lives as they pursued their education. Ideally, there would be two Champions in every school: a pupil and a member of staff.\nIt’s a great idea and one I fully support. Elizabeth is planning an event with Paul Matson and the Hull for Heroes team and I have arranged a meeting with Hull academy trust executives this week.\nIf you work in a local school and you’re interested in this please get in touch.\nAnd finally,\nAs always, please feel free to share this letter with anyone you think might be interested. I will be doing as much as I can to offer assistance and advice over the coming months and represent the constituency in Parliament; please do not hesitate",

  "https_www_emmahardy_org_uk_/https_www_emmahardy_org_uk_2018_11_26_my-week-ahead-26th-november-2018/content_265.html": "Hi everyone,\nThis week I’m starting a new feature on my website to tell you all about what I’m going to be up to over the course of this week. Many members of the public have no idea what an MP gets up to and, as your voice in Westminster, it’s important to me that you know what I’m doing on your behalf. If you have any feedback or questions on any of these activities then please don’t hesitate to get in touch with my office on 01482 219 211 or by email on emma.hardy.mp@parliament.uk\nMonday\nOn Monday, I will be in Parliament. I’ll be meeting with the Labour Brexit team. Following this, I’ll be asking a question in Defence Questions about BAE in Brough. I have significant concerns about the over-reliance of the site on Hawk aircraft. Workers seem to be constantly in fear of their jobs and unable to guarantee that they will remain in post for more than 12 months if new Hawk orders do not come in. Last week, I launched a letter that I co-signed with several other MPs asking for a meeting with the Chief Executive of BAE to discuss diversification of the site to guarantee jobs and put workers’ minds at ease.\nTuesday\nOn Tuesday, the Education Select Committee will be holding a hearing on the Fourth Industrial Revolution and I will be asking the witnesses how they think our education system should change to identify and train students for a future where automation is likely to change the way the world of work operates and affect who is able to access it. I recently visited Germany where a German Green Party politician told me that he couldn’t understand our obsession with treating education as a commodity rather than a social good when we face these dramatic future changes in the way our economy works.\nFollowing this, I will be asking a question to the Health Minister Steve Brine about what effect the ban on GPs from prescribing treatment for headlice will have on the ability of children from lower income families from accessing treatment for it.\nI also have a meeting with the other Humberside MPs and Sajid Javid about the Police Pension Scheme and the effect that it is having on Humberside Police. The last revaluation of the scheme was undertaken in 2016 and resulted in a reduction in the employer’s contribution by 2.9%. This saving was not passed onto the police service but was instead retained by the Treasury. For Humberside Police, this equated to £1.7 million. The current revaluation adds £6.6 million per year to Humberside Police’s costs from 2020/21 onwards and would require losing the equivalent of 132 officers to bridge this gap. I will be arguing\nWednesday\nOn Wednesday, I will be attending a Surgical Mesh stakeholders workshop to continue to press the case for better treatment of mesh injured women. The workshop is being run by HQIP (Healthcare Quality Improvement Partnership) who are undertaking exploratory work on behalf of the Department of Health around the data capture and reporting requirements of procedures for stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse using surgical mesh.\nThursday\nOn Thursday, I will be asking a question to the Leader of the House of Commons, Andrea Leadsom, about Police Funding and its effect on Anti-Social Behaviour in Hull West and Hessle. The exact content of my question may change depending on the content of the meeting with Sajid Javid on Tuesday. Following this, I will be participating in a debate on ‘Standards in Education’ and raising the issue of access to education. With recent statistics showing that the number of children being ‘home schooled’ in Hull has risen from 120 cases in 2015/16 to 278 cases this year, the issue of children being unable to access their education is already a huge news story this week but exclusions from school is only part of the issue. Some schools use long term isolation to prevent children from accessing their education for long periods of time. These children are overwhelmingly those with Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND) who could be integrated into classes with more support. Unfortunately, this support is not available due to lack of SEND funding from central government.\nFriday\nMy meetings on Friday include the Refugee Roundtable meeting and a meeting with Yorkshire Water to discuss the recent news that some of their pipes in Hull are over 95 years old. This was recently in the spotlight when a water main burst in Hull City Centre and caused extensive flooding between Osborne Street and Midland Street last month.\nAll the best,\nEmma",

Like climate change, the virus cannot be bargained with or bought off. It is not susceptible to PR campaigns or influenced by social media. It follows a set of rules that we are free to ignore, but not to change.\nSince the last Waterline conference we have learned more about the rules that climate change is following and the news is not good. The latest research has shown that the melting of the Antarctic ice cap is now irreversible, even if we keep to the maximum two degrees overall rise in temperatures set out in the Paris Agreement. The Arctic Sea is now predicted to be ice-free over summer by 2050 in all models. In some areas of the Arctic Circle the permafrost is melting 70 years ahead of predictions. The deepest waters of the oceans are warming more quickly than expected\nAll of these factors mean significant rises in sea level are inevitable during this century and they will have profound consequences for regions like the Humber. 90% of Hull lies below the present high tide mark and the challenges we will face will be considerable.\nWaterline and Zero Carbon Humber\nInitiatives like Waterline have never been more important or more urgently needed. The future of humanity rests on achieving a net zero carbon economy and getting there soon. Someone, somewhere has to take a lead and those of us in the region surrounding the River Humber are well placed to do so\nIn fact, that work has already begun. The Zero Carbon Humber campaign is headed by energy companies Drax Group, Equinor and National Grid Ventures along with the Humber Local Enterprise Partnership and CATCH, a trade body for industrials in the region. Feasibility work is underway to show how pioneering carbon capture, usage and storage technology can make the Humber a net zero carbon economy while providing the foundation for the roll-out of low carbon hydrogen as a fuel for industry, power, heat and transport across the wider Yorkshire and North of England region.\nInvestment in wind energy continues unabated and Humber Gateway and Westermost Rough have been joined by Hornsea One, the world’s largest wind farm, with Hornsea Two under construction.\nThese large scale projects didn’t come out of nowhere. Research, innovation and development are key. There must be the means to facilitate the exchange of ideas and support new ventures. The Aura Innovation Centre at Bridgehead Business Park, Hessle, opened its doors last year, aiming to deliver ground-breaking low-carbon projects and kick-start new ideas by bringing together experts at the University of Hull with businesses in the Humber region and beyond.\nHull City Council has declared a Climate Emergency and is aiming to make the authority Carbon Neutral by 2030. Such local action is equally important in changing the wider community’s perceptions and last year, when Waterline was a physical conference, the Butterfly City project had a stall, distributing free foodplants for the Brimstone butterfly. It brought together many local groups, schools and individuals enabling them to make a positive difference to their environment\nEarth 2050\nEarth 2050 began in 2016 with a recognition that many people especially those in urban environments – are divorced from the ecological systems that surround them and sustain all life on this planet. Its aim was to awaken that awareness and illuminate the destructive pressures on those systems. Pressures that result from the way we live our lives and the processes that support our technological civilisation.\nIt chose to do so through art: to pose the question “what will the world look like in 2050?” Some of the answers to that question have already been decided, but it still remains that the choices we make and the actions we take today and tomorrow will shape the final answer.\nWherever we find ourselves in 2050, how we have got there and the direction of travel will be equally as important. We must have decisively changed the course of our civilisation and for that to happen there must be a corresponding change in the way we relate to the living world around us – in our hearts and in our minds.\nArt can help us to achieve that – to help us to look at our world in a new way – to our feelings and our approaches. There is much talk of “individual action” in the fight against climate change and environmental destruction, but the truth is we are a social animal – we evolved to live and solve our problems communally. The fragmentation of society works against our very natures\nArt brings us together. In both its creation and its appreciation it acts as a focus. People and ideas mix, thoughts and feelings are shared. Connections are made. Hope is kindled.\nMaking a Difference\nThe task ahead of us can seem daunting, but we can ease those feelings of helplessness through individual actions. There are plenty of options and they can all contribute to reducing waste, environmental destruction, depletion of resources or greenhouse gas emission. I don’t think it would be helpful to begin a list of all the choices, however I will name the one I think is the most important.\nGet involved.\nIt will only be through collective action that we can finally achieve the changes necessary.\nI’d like to congratulate everybody who has taken part in the competition and all those who have facilitated it. I hope the earth2050 project continues to bring people together, open eyes and minds to the challenges our world faces and inspire creative and hope-filled responses to them.",

This new institution will play a crucial role in expanding and improving SEND provisions in the area, providing an additional 125 SEND places for the city.\nLocal representatives have expressed their excitement and gratitude for this decision. “Expanding and improving SEND provisions is a top priority for me, and I know just how much this school means to families in our community,” said Emma Hardy MP. “I’m thrilled that the government has stepped up to ensure Willowfield Free School becomes a reality, giving children with additional needs the support and opportunities they deserve,” she added.\nThis funding marks a significant step forward for SEND education in Hull, promising enhanced support and opportunities for children with additional needs.",

This funding is aimed at ensuring safer and smoother roads for local communities and vehicles.\nIn an effort to ensure that the funding is directed where it is most needed, I have launched a survey to gather input from residents. The survey seeks to identify areas within both council areas where potholes and road conditions are a significant concern.\nI am pleased that the government recognises the importance of addressing the challenges posed by poor road conditions in our community. The funding for both East Riding of Yorkshire Council and Hull City Council is a welcome investment in our local infrastructure.

Tackling anti- social behaviour has been a huge priority of mine in the two years I have spent as an MP so far and I have raised the issue several times in Parliament, including leading a debate on the subject in Westminster Hall. This walk around will allow me to see exactly what the issue is like on the ground in Boothferry and I hope to be able to work closely with Humberside police to put local strategies in place to tackle anti-social behaviour in the ward. I will spend the rest of the day in my constituency office meeting with constituents and helping them solve the issues that matter to them.\nTuesday\nOn Tuesday, I will be in my constituency office meeting with constituents and helping them solve the issues that matter to them.\nWednesday\nOn Wednesday, I will return to Parliament and to a meeting of the Education Select Committee where we will be holding an accountability hearing with the Secretary of State for Education. While it is true that a new Prime Minister will soon be in place and that he may very well choose to appoint a different Education Secretary, this will still be a good opportunity to raise issues with the institution of the Department for Education as a whole that affect the ability of all our children to get a good education.\nLater in the day, I’ll be attending a mass lobby on climate change. Climate change is obviously one of the most pressing issues of the day with the UN stating that we could do irreversible damage to the planet if we do not make a serious dent in carbon emissions by 2030. I was proud to vote for Labour’s motion to declare a climate emergency in Parliament earlier this year and I want to see sustainability as a key factor in any future development in Hull. I hope to be able to learn more about the strategies we can take from this lobby. Following this, I will be holding a meeting with the Spinal Injuries Association to talk to them about the way that the government’s drastic cuts to social care are affecting their members.\nThursday\nFollowing questions to the Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, I will be meeting with Keith Hunter, the Police and Crime Commissioner to hear about his priorities for policing in the constituency. I will also be pressing upon him the importance of tackling anti-social behaviour and illicit tobacco sales and discussing ways that a police presence can be maintained in Hessle.\nFollowing this, I am pleased to announce that Labour’s Shadow Brexit Secretary, Keir Starmer will be visiting Hull to talk to residents about their views on Brexit. Keir will be holding a series of events across the constituency including a meeting with the Chamber of Commerce and several roundtable meetings. I am absolutely delighted that Keir is coming to Hull to listen to what we have to say. This is just the latest indication of Labour’s willingness to listen to all parts of the country and try to find a method of achieving Brexit that brings the country together and works for the many, not the few.\nFriday\nOn Friday, representatives of First Group will be coming to Hull Station for a tour of the station. As part of this tour, I will be raising the issue of access to the station. You will no doubt have seen in the media recently that a number of people, led by the amazing Labour activist Tracy Dearing, have raised concerns about the effect that closing off the side access to the station will have on disabled or other vulnerable people. I have been supporting the petition they have made and hope that First Group take it very seriously. Other visits for the day include Northumberland Court and Wyke College.",

  "https_www_emmahardy_org_uk_/https_www_emmahardy_org_uk_2020_06_04_looking-back-better-2-the-future-forum-on-community/content_301.html": "The second part of a three part guest article series:\nWhat is ‘community’? What does it look like? How has our perception of the term changed in the course of the coronavirus crisis?\nby Alex Talbot, originally published at www.rethinkingpoverty.org.uk\nAny meaningful engagement with the idea of ‘community’ requires interrogation beyond its woolly associations with cosy inclusion. Pulling apart the term requires critical bite. In Hull, we opened discussion of our topics (community, technology, education and climate) with provocations designed to challenge. In her opening provocation playwright Maureen Lennon brilliantly brought the bite needed to discuss community.\nMaureen questioned the way the term is thrown around, highlighted its natural exclusivity, expanded its meaning beyond physical proximity in our networked world. She also looked directly at Hull, a city whose identity has been the subject of national interest, from post-industrial decline to city of culture, asking: what now?\nAccompanied by actor and academic Michael Howcroft, Maureen then worked with the young people to facilitate discussion and help them create a 3-minute provocation, using theatre techniques to draw upon their own experience. Their pithy piece opens with a call for communities that are connected, kind and educated. Smaller conversational scenes consider hierarchies of power in the workplace, the vulnerability of the homeless (‘we have each other, but that guy had no one’), and the limitations of the ‘social’ in social media. The line ‘there’s nothing like meeting face to face’ now has added poignancy in the context of our socially distanced lives. The scene ends with a confrontation, sparked by pro-Brexit posters and the invocation of the abstract ‘foreigner’ apparently responsible for the unfair distribution of resources. More subtly, it draws attention both to the hope invested in ‘facts’ and solutions that have since been exposed as empty propaganda, and to the limited capacity for many to be politically engaged when immediate concerns of secure employment and supporting families consume your day to day. The two women in the argument share the same concerns, the ‘foreigner’ finally protesting: ‘we need help and support out here too.’\nBut what of community now? In a short space of time, the once radical concept of mutual aid has become a household term. At a time of crisis community building has frequently worked faster than official channels of power. At the same time we have also seen previously unimaginable moves from those official channels, with the government working to house the homeless, sending care packages to the vulnerable and calling upon a willing public to boost morale around and volunteer for the NHS.\nAnd what of the ‘foreigner’ our Hull performance invokes? The loaded term inaccurately and destructively denies the complexity of our uncomfortable history and the benefits of immigration for our economy and society. In the last few weeks, we have seen the unimaginable sacrifices made by the BAME workforce that is the backbone of the NHS. Further, we have actively called on the ‘foreigner’, with some 150 Romanian field labourers arriving despite all to support fruit-picking on British farms and ‘help feed Britain amid a continuing recruitment crisis in the agricultural sector’. Arguably in a crisis we, as a nation, are happier to herald those who are supporting our needs, whatever their background and race, but this is not enough. We need long-term structural support for migrant workers and a real and accurate understanding of ‘nationality’ that will boldly challenge any return to a lazy and harmful ‘foreigner’ narrative.\nWhat about ‘community’ where ‘face-to-face’ contact is no longer possible? We are all embracing the technology available to us (and yet it is not available to all of us). In a sense there is a renewed feeling of responsibility – to support communities, to hold the government to account, and to look at our national response in relation to others. But as Emily Maitlis so effectively pointed out, this virus is not a simplistic leveller. With existing inequalities exacerbated, the most vulnerable communities bear the brunt of the worst outcomes. Further, while we are all dealing with the same threat, we have also all become a potential threat to our neighbours. While some seek collaboration, fear and insecurity has also driven selfishness and hostility towards the ‘other’.\nThe experiences and questions raised in Hull foreshadow our current reality. How community is invoked through and beyond this crisis is a key question. Does the (frequently performative) solidarity engendered by the extremity of our present situation have a life beyond it? Making the connections between then and now will be important if we are to hope that it might lead to a more widespread call to tackle longer-term systemic inequalities.\nAlex Talbott is Programme Manager for The Orwell Youth Prize",

In addition to boosting the workforce, this initiative will provide vital support in managing current waiting lists, helping to ensure that patients waiting on lists across local dentistry practices receive the care they need in a more timely manner.\nHull West and Haltemprice MP Emma Hardy stated, “Recently, the oral health of residents in our area has been extremely negatively impacted by consecutive Conservative governments’ failures to address issues around the NHS dental contract. The current government is looking into these vital reforms, but in the meantime, the Centre for Dental Development is a much-needed boost for our local dental services. It reflects our ongoing commitment to improving access to dental care for our community. While this is an encouraging step, we recognise that there is still much work to be done in tackling the NHS dentistry crisis in Hull.”\nHull North and Cottingham MP Diana Johnson added: “NHS dentistry is in crisis after years of austerity and neglect that left many of our constituents struggling to get or keep access to NHS dental services. While the new Labour Government is working on reform plans to reverse the decline nationally, Labour MPs locally have been working to boost the number of NHS dentists trained to serve our area. There is still much to do, but this new Centre is a welcome step towards restoring NHS dentistry to local communities.”\nAndrew Hobson, Deputy Director for Dental Commissioning, shared his insights, stating, “I was grateful for the opportunity to join Emma in a recent discussion about the current challenges in NHS dental services. We understand the frustrations many people face when trying to book routine appointments, and we know that dentists are doing their best to offer as many NHS slots as possible to meet this high demand. Unfortunately, the ongoing difficulties with recruiting and retaining dental professionals are further limiting the ability of practices to accommodate all patients.\n“During the conversation, we highlighted some of the steps we’re taking to address these issues, including the Centre for Dental Development planned to launch later this year. This initiative aims to improve recruitment and retention of dentists in our local area. We encourage everyone to keep reaching out to NHS dentists, as they do not have registered patient lists like GPs do, and practices can open their books to new patients at any time. For those in urgent need of dental care, NHS 111 remains available to assess symptoms like severe ongoing tooth pain, ensuring that those with the most pressing needs receive timely support.”\n“The Centres of Dental Development are a positive step in the right direction by the ICB, they will help increase access, aid recruit and retention of dentists and increase the level of skills and expertise in our region” said Chris Groombridge, Secretary of the Local Dental Committee for Hull & East Yorkshire.\nDespite this positive development, both MPs acknowledge that challenges remain in fully addressing the NHS dentistry crisis in Hull and East Yorkshire. They emphasise the need for continued investment and support to ensure sustainable solutions for the long-term future of dental care in the region.\nAs the Centre for Dental Development prepares to open its doors, Emma Hardy and Diana Johnson reaffirm their commitment to advocating for the health and well-being of their constituents. They will continue to work collaboratively with local healthcare providers and the ICB to ensure that dental services are accessible, equitable, and efficient.",

  "https_www_emmahardy_org_uk_/https_www_emmahardy_org_uk_2020_03_02_annual-apprenticeship-conference-2020/content_58.html": "KEYNOTE SPEECH\nI’m now eight weeks into my new role as Shadow FE and HE Minister and I want to give thanks to my predecessor Gordon Marsden whose dedication and commitment to FE and HE was unrivalled, he is a truly decent man and I can only hope to do his work justice and build on the positive relationships he developed throughout the sector.\nIntroduction\nPrior to being elected I was a primary teacher for eleven years, National Education Union employee and education activist so it was no surprise that after entering parliament in 2017 I chose to serve on the Education Select Committee. I was delighted to asked to become the Shadow FE and HE Minister, and I cannot see a future where I am not involved in education.\nSince accepting the role of Shadow FE Minister, I have been touched by the warm welcome from the sector and the clear and tangible desire you have to improve the life chances of people throughout the UK.\nLabour party committed to a National Education Service in its 2019 manifesto and I believe that Lifelong Learning should be a right of everyone in the UK. That this not only benefits the individual but brings benefits to wider society. That includes the world of business and commerce.\nApprenticeships are an ideal vehicle for providing a pathway to improvement throughout a person’s working life and so a natural fit with our vision for the UK of the future.\nThanks to the work of all of you and people working in FE up and down the country the prestige of apprenticeships is rising. Within the last month there have been three parliamentary debates on FE with two dedicated solely to apprenticeships. The Speaker of the house of commons has announced he will have an apprentice and this year’s Apprentice Week in the House of Commons was very well attended. For the first time in years there is a growing consensus that being an apprentice is a ‘good thing’ in the same way that they were highly sought after in the past.\nSo how can something as universally ‘good’ as apprenticeships be failing in so many areas?\nChallenges\nDespite the hard work of the FE sector the funding cuts and ill-considered changes have created an education system where “if at first you don’t succeed, then you don’t succeed” as life chances and opportunity have been taken away from those who need it the most.\nThe rushed implementation of the Apprenticeship Levy has resulted, not in an increase in apprenticeships and opportunities for the most disadvantaged, but quite the opposite.\nThis approach has thrown up several questions. Is the levy a skills tax or an individual companies funding pot? What is an apprenticeship? Who, exactly, is the levy primarily intended to help?\nAlison Wolf, The governments skills advisor, warned the Education Committee in June 2016 that rushed implementation could result in “unforeseen consequences and perverse incentives” but her warning has not been heeded.\nRebadging apprenticeships\nThere are significant concerns that companies are rebadging existing qualifications. The Sutton Trust was quick to spot the developing situation and warned in November 2017 that an estimated two-thirds of businesses apprenticeship schemes were merely ‘converting’ existing employees and certifying existing skills, and that the Levy may encourage more of these ‘conversions’ and re-badgings as a way for levy payers to reclaim their money.\nThe controversial EDSK paper by Tom Richmond illustrates an example where 23 HE institutions have worked together to create an apprenticeship which requires a Level 8 or PHD to start, surely this should not be considered an apprenticeship.\nThe government should end the 100% use of levy money for master’s courses.\nDegree apprenticeships though are a different matter. They provide opportunities for people who have never considered they could have a degree the chance to learn and earn at the same time.\nThey have the potential to be real drivers of social mobility and address current occupational shortages.\nMore work must be done to ensure equal representation within Degree Apprenticeships, and I support the expansion of them at HE institutions throughout the country.\nI believe that Degree apprenticeships should continue to be fully funded from the levy for people 25 and under, occupations on the shortage occupation list and adults who do not already have an equivalent qualification.\nLow skilled qualifications\nThe Government’s stated vision for apprenticeships “to be available across all sectors of the economy, in all parts of the country and at all levels” was an invitation for low value schemes without effective safeguards in place.\nWe have seen levy funding used to deliver various “low-skill and generic jobs that are now counted as an apprenticeship which lack occupation-specific knowledge and skills.\nThere is little doubt that when over 35% of pupils leaving school without the qualifications they need to start on L3 that L2 is a crucial first step but it should not be an endpoint.\nA L2 qualification currently provides no average wage increase compared to a worker without L2 but L3 gives average wage increase of 20%.\nCurrently two thirds of apprentices engaged in L2 do not go onto a L3.\nI believe that there are simple changes that the government could make to address this imbalance.\nI support the TUC who believe that all apprentices who have the aptitude and desire to progress should be given opportunities to do so and the Sutton Trust who think “Progression for those beginning on lower level apprenticeships should be seamless and automatic so that young people don’t drop out before getting a good quality apprenticeship.”\nTo reinforce Level 2 Apprenticeships being seen as a starting point and not an end point they should be rebranded as Foundation Apprenticeships.\nYoung Apprentices\nWe have seen a 20% fall in 16-to-18 apprenticeships which is cutting off the apprenticeship progression route.\nApprentices in this age group also face challenges with loss of child benefit for parents and being expected to pay full price for prescriptions.\nThere should be full funding for all 16-18 year old apprentices out of the education budget. This would be a recognition of the extra resources and time required by employers for this age group and give an equal status of apprenticeships with other qualifications taken by young people.\nOver 35% of students did not get a grade 4 or above in GCSE English and Maths at first attempt which indicates they need support above and beyond what they had at school to obtain the results they need.\nWe have a situation where around half of the working-age population lack basic numeracy skills. This proportion is similar in all the regions of England and in Wales with one in six of the working-age population lack basic literacy skills.\nI share concerns that the current funding rate of £471 per subject in functional skills is almost 50% less than the stand-alone rate for the same programme. But even the standalone rate of £724 per learner is not enough to deliver the subjects without incurring financial losses.\nThere must be double the funding for maths and English in apprenticeships.\nLevy issues\nWhen I questioned the FE Minister at a debate in February, she told me “We do not and did not anticipate that all businesses that paid the levy would need or want to use all the money” If companies were never intended to use all their levy why give them access to all?\nCompanies now are using 78% of their levy with all indicators showing the trend is for companies to spend more but the current system the government created is based on the premise that they will only use 60-70%. The levy is running out of money.\nThe government should end the 10% contribution to levy payers digital accounts and stop the 95% funding for levy payers who have used all their levy.\nSMEs\nTraditionally, SMEs have been the largest recruiters of young apprentices, and they have generally been the recruiters of apprentices at a starter level. They have suffered the most under the botched levy reforms introduced by this government.\nThere has been a fall of 171,000 apprentices in SME. That is down an estimated 49% since the levy was introduced and SMEs receive only half as much apprenticeship funding compared with April 2017, when the levy was introduced.\nCurrent estimates are that between 30,000 and 40,000 SME apprenticeship vacancies remain unfilled and there could be a loss of 75,000 apprenticeships in SMEs by the end of 2020.\nYet we find that for once in education there is unity; the chief executive of the employer-led Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education believes that the apprenticeship levy needs to be topped up with additional Government funding to address the shortage of funds available for apprenticeships offered by smaller businesses. Her comments follow similar concerns expressed by Ofsted’s chief inspector that the levy is not working in a way which would satisfy the Government’s ‘levelling up’ agenda across the UK regions.\nGovernment must provide a separate ring-fenced funding stream for SMEs of £1.5bn.\nThe government’s suggestion to solve the problem by putting SMEs on the digital platform will not solve the problem. Even increasing the numbers by 15,000 will not be enough to cover the 49% decrease they have already seen.\nGiving people more access to a system that does not have enough money just means that they have greater access to having no money; it does not solve the problem.\nThere are also specific concerns with the design of the online digital platform for SMEs which need addressing.\nAddressing Disadvantage\nDisadvantaged people of all ages are disproportionately clustered at the lower levels of apprenticeships; they are significantly more likely to be studying at Level 2 or 3 apprenticeships than in higher or degree-level apprenticeships.\nHowever, not only has the Levy led to a dramatic fall in Level 2 and level 3 provision but at the same time people from deprived communities are being squeezed out of higher-level apprenticeships.\nIn 2015-16 – before the introduction of the Levy – the most deprived 20% of the population accounted for 21.9% of apprenticeships starts at level 4 or higher. By 2018-19, this figure had dropped to 16.4%.\nThe Social Mobility Commission has warned that a “two-tier system … based on apprentices’ backgrounds,” may be emerging.\nWe know that too many leaners are facing apprenticeship poverty and spending more money on travelling to work and college than they earn.\nI recognise that although the national apprenticeship minimum wage is £3.90 the average wage is £6.70, but that is still nowhere near a living wage. The National Women’s Trust reported that one reason young women stop apprenticeships is because they receive less in wages than it costs them to do the apprenticeship. Social mobility is an unrealistic dream if the barriers to learning are too high.\nIt is outrageous that 26% of employment law cases involving employers not paying the minimum wage are from apprentices despite the fact they only make up 3% of employees. This blatant exploitation is appalling.\nWhat makes this even worse is that between January 2016 and June 2017 fewer than five employers were prosecuted.\nThe £240m saved from ending the 10% employer contributions to levy payers should be used to create a bursary package for disadvantaged apprentices to support with travel costs, equipment and related expenses and reach underrepresented groups.\nThe apprenticeship minimum wage should be increased.\nIt is not enough to “name and shame” employers who exploit apprentices, they should face criminal prosecutions and the government should invest in more effective enforcement.\nFuture Proof Apprenticeships\nWe need to future proof apprenticeships. The world of work is changing and few can agree on the impact of automation but we need to be honest and ask, with some of the apprenticeship standards we are developing are we training people for work in a specific company or giving them the transferable skills, they need to survive in a changing world.\nWe need to look at providing relevant qualifications for all levels of apprenticeships to enable people to take their learning with them.\nClimate change is happening now, and effects will become increasingly apparent. There will be increasing demand for existing solutions as well as big rewards for being first to develop workable new solutions. Labour’s pledge to create 320,000 climate apprenticeships was with the purpose of making the UK a world leader in the technologies of the future.\nWe need to develop new Green Apprenticeship standards.\nThe most difficult challenge of all is to transform our society into one that loves and values lifelong learning. We must forever change from “if at first you don’t succeed you don’t succeed” to “you never stop learning.” We need to make the country fall in love with learning.\nWe need a universal, right to learn throughout life, underpinned by a minimum entitlement to fully-funded local level 3 provision and the equivalent of 6 years’ publicly-funded credits at level 4 and above, with additional support for priority groups.\nLabour will be bringing forward amendments in the upcoming Employment Bill to introduce a universal Right to Learn for every citizen in our country.\nTo fully utilise the legislative power having a ‘Right to Learn’ gives, we need to look again at having Individual learning accounts. This would give every individual the right to learn and the resources to access the learning they need.\nConclusion\nOur actions show what we value. At every stage, if it’s not working for the disadvantaged in our society then it’s not working. The government should complete an equality impact assessment for every change, so they don’t continue to make the same mistakes.\nWe cannot do nothing. Doing nothing is an active choice to allow deterioration to continue for our young people and SMEs.\nWhen the government talk of hard choices the most disadvantaged always seem to suffer the most.\nI believe everyone is equally important. Education can be the most powerful tool in the world and everyone deserves equality of opportunity. Equality is not giving everyone the same and wondering why some achieve and others don’t, it is about giving everyone exactly what they need to achieve and recognising that needs to be bespoke.\nThis is why FE is so crucially important.\nAs your Shadow representative and future Minister, it is my ambition to work closely with you to focus that desire for true equality of opportunity relentlessly at the government until we see the changes that young people and the sector needs.\nDisclaimer: This article by Emma Hardy MP is not binding nor official Labour Party policy and is open for discussion.\nFor more information contact Sean Clough Parliamentary Researcher sean.clough@parliament.uk or Lee Holland Communications Manager lee.holland@parliament.uk",

There is a growing consensus across society including government, employers, teachers, and parents, as to the importance of oracy in education. However, members of the Oracy APPG are concerned that oracy is being undervalued and overlooked within state education, denying the majority of children and young people the opportunity to develop these vital skills and hampering social mobility, educational achievement, wellbeing and future employability. This inquiry will investigate the current provision of oracy education in the UK, assess the value and impact of oracy education and identify the barriers to children accessing and receiving quality oracy education.\nI will also be attempting to ask the new Secretary of State for Defence, Penny Mordaunt, about what support can be given to veterans suffering with mental health problems following the recent suicide in my constituency.\nTuesday\nOn Tuesday, I will be attending the Education Select Committee. This is the twelfth and final oral evidence session of the Committee’s inquiry into special educational needs and disabilities. This session with Ministers and civil servants is an opportunity for Members to seek clarification on evidence that has been gathered throughout the inquiry and explore the SEND reforms with the Department. I will be raising concerns about the lack of funding and support for children with SEND.\nWednesday\nOn Wednesday, I have the privilege to join Diana Johnson in hosting the headscarf revolutionary, Yvonne Blenkinsop at the House of Commons. Yvonne’s story is exceptionally inspirational and is one that should be shared widely both in Hull and outside of it. I will also be speaking in the Opposition Day debate on social mobility and inequality. Hull has some of the poorest areas in the country and, in my constituency of Hull West and Hessle, one in three children live in poverty. Poverty affects life chances and fewer people in Hull are likely to be in a managerial or professional role than in other parts of the country. I will be arguing that it is only through regional investment that we will see an increase in social mobility and a reduction in poverty.\nThursday\nMy meetings on Thursday include STAND about the ongoing dispute around the fisherman’s memorial and how I can support them. I will also visit Advanced Modular Management Solutions, I have spoken before about how keen I am to support the modular building industry and I see it as a key area for growth of high quality jobs in the area.\nI will also be hosting an evening to discuss how we help children who have experienced Adverse Childhood Experiences. The other important thing that is happening on Thursday is the European Elections and I would encourage everyone to vote Labour. No one expected us to be holding these European elections, but the Government’s complete failure on Brexit means they are going ahead. Only the Labour Party, which represents all parts of the country, whether people voted to Leave or to Remain, is committed to finding a solution which can bring the country together. From taking urgent action on the climate emergency, to protecting and strengthening workers’ rights, to facing down the far right, our manifesto speaks to the lives of people in Britain and across Europe. The real divide in our country is not how people voted in the EU referendum. It is between the many and the few- Labour is on the side of the many. Labour is on your side.\nFriday\nMy meetings on Friday include the Ergo Innovation Centre, the Education Alliance and the Apprenticeship Ambassador Frank Clayton.",

The fact that the forms for both benefits are exceptionally complicated, that expert help is not always available and that the assessment process following a claim is unduly stressful only add to the hardship for disabled people. It is almost as if this government wants to make claims unnecessarily complicated and difficult to process.\nThe Labour Party invented the welfare system to look after those with genuine need but, under this Conservative government, the system attacks disabled people and is not fit for purpose. I asked the Minister today to look at how the application form can be made simpler and how changes can be made to make sure that the large number of claimants who are eligible for both ESA and PIP don’t have to go through the same process twice. I will continue to press the government to make sure these changes are made and disabled people are put back at the centre of our welfare system.",

Emma Hardy, MP for Hull West and Hessle, an area which knows the dangers of flooding only too well, hosted a roundtable event in partnership with Aviva, the UK’s largest home insurer, to discuss how these deficiencies could tackled – particularly through the forthcoming National Development Management Plans.\nThe event was held in Parliament on July 5, and was attended by representatives from the insurance industry, national bodies involved in planning, flooding and adaptation to climate change, Ruth Jones MP, Shadow minister for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and a range of other experts.\nOpening the roundtable, Adam Winslow, CEO of Aviva said, “Our homes are at risk like never before. The climate crisis is bringing more extreme heat, subsidence, storms and floods, and we know there is more in store. One in every four homes in the UK is at risk of flooding and at Aviva all too often we see the impact this has.”\n“National and local government need to work hand in glove with the construction and insurance industries to find practical solutions to ensure we build the right homes in the right places – not just for today, but long into the future too.”\nCurrently, developers are allowed to sell properties before they have put agreed flood mitigations in place. It was felt that this practice should be ended, and that building regulations should be updated to require all properties at risk of flooding to include property flood resilience measures.\nSpeaking after the event, Emma Hardy said “I am glad that the government is making the requirement for Sustainable Drainage Systems on new developments mandatory, but we need to make sure they are being done properly and continue to function. That means proper resourcing of Local Authorities to enforce regulations and monitor effectiveness.“\nPrevention of flooding in one area very often requires work and adaptions elsewhere and the consensus was that a more integrated approach to water management needs to be adopted. Where water goes after a new development is created is as important as where the water might be coming from.\nAt the moment, this wider view is not feeding through to local planning and decisions are being made which might have local benefit but create more problems elsewhere.\nThere were a number of contributions on the important role water management can play in increasing biodiversity and in meeting net zero targets. For example, bogs and salt marshes store water and slow the flow of water, but are also carbon traps and rich habitats for a diverse range of plants and animals. There was agreement that developing a truly integrated approach to water management could not be done without considering its role in improving nature and reaching net zero.\nIncreased enforcement of regulations and developing new approaches to managing water will require further recruitment and training. This should be seen as an opportunity for growing new skills and expertise.\nAlthough there are considerable problems to face as climate change begins to bite, tides continue to rise and extreme weather events become more frequent, there is reason to be optimistic. There is a concerted will in the UK from all those involved to tackle this problem and continue to ensure home owners are financially protected. Contrast this approach to California, where two of the biggest insurers recently pulled out of the market, leaving millions without cover.\nAdam Winslow concluded “Although change can be contentious, we have a fantastic opportunity to help the UK to build sustainably for the future, while still meeting the pressing demand for new houses. I was energised by the discussion, and believe we have strong support for reforms that deliver these goals.”\nEmma Hardy agreed “It was encouraging to hear such close agreement around the table, both on the problems and the best solutions. We’re looking forward to contributing to the NDMP consultation, to help government produce a plan with clear and straightforward standards which also gives Local Planning Authorities the powers to go above and beyond them.”",

A growing economy and public services fit for the future need a modern transport system to support the flow of people and goods across the country. Under the Conservatives Britain’s broken rail network is simply not delivering: cancellations have soared to record high levels, fares have risen almost twice as fast as wages since 2010, and strikes are costing taxpayers £25m for every day they go ahead, whilst taxpayers fork out huge subsidies to pay for trains that are overcrowded, delayed or cancelled.\nLabour will fold existing private passenger rail contracts into Great British Railways as they expire, without the taxpayer paying a penny in compensation costs, as part of a publicly owned and passenger focused railway.\nLabour’s plans mean an end to the misery Northern passengers across Yorkshire and the Humber face on a weekly basis.\nNorthern passengers have faced a huge 394% increase in cancelled services since 2016,[i] and only 50% of Northern trains were on time in October-December last year. [ii]\nThis compares to a shocking 61% increase in cancellations across Britain since 2016, with only 62% of services on time in October-December last year.\nDuring its first term, a Labour Government would:\n- Put the passenger first, by delivering a best-price ticket guarantee for passengers, and rolling out automatic delay repay and digital season tickets across the network\n- Establish a powerful new passenger watchdog, the Passenger Standards Authority, to hold Great British Railways to account for passengers\n- Deliver significant savings to the taxpayer by eliminating fragmentation, waste, bureaucracy and by stopping profits leaking out to private operators\n- Create a unified, publicly owned, accountable and arm’s length Great British Railways, which will be led by rail experts, not Whitehall\n- Expect to complete the transition to public ownership within the first term of a Labour Government, by folding existing private passenger rail contracts into the new body as they expire, without the taxpayer paying a penny in compensation costs\n- Give devolved leaders, including Mayoral Combined Authorities, a statutory role in the rail network, allowing decisions about the railways to be taken closer to the communities they serve\n- Support successful open access and freight operators to continue to deliver, and set clear objectives and targets for passenger services and freight growth\nLabour’s plans mean delivering a unified, publicly owned rail within the first term of a Labour Government, as franchises are brought in house as contracts expire, meaning taxpayers won’t pay a penny in compensation costs.\nEmma Hardy MP for Hull West and Hessle said:\n“For too long my constituents have been let down by unreliable and inefficient train services, holding back our economy and stopping people accessing opportunities.\n“That’s I am supporting Labour’s plans to create Great British Railways – a new, publicly owned and expert-led body to run our railways and put the passenger first.\n“Labour’s plans will mean reliable, safe, efficient, accessible, affordable and quality train services, no matter where you live.”\nLouise Haigh, Labour’s Shadow Secretary of State for Transport said:\n“Labour will deliver the biggest overhaul in our railways for a generation, ending the deepening crisis and chaos that passengers have been forced to endure in recent years.\n“Underinvestment, fragmentation, inefficiency, waste and 14 years of tinkering by Conservative Ministers have left our railways unfit to meet the demands of modern Britain.\n“Under Labour, a publicly owned and controlled railway will focus on what matters to passengers.”\nFor more information on ‘Getting Britain Moving: Labour’s Plan to Fix Britain’s Railways’ is available here: labour.org.uk/get-britain-moving\n[i] Office of Rail and Road cancellation data (accessed April 2024): https://dataportal.orr.gov.uk/media/2177/table-3123-trains-planned-and-cancellations-by-operator-and-cause.ods\n[ii] Office of Rail and Road punctuality data (accessed April 2024): https://dataportal.orr.gov.uk/statistics/performance/passenger-rail-performance/",

I express my deepest sympathies to Hull’s Muslim Communities and that I stand in solidarity with you.\n“My heart truly goes out to all the victims and their families. Mosques are a place of worship and to be attacked whilst at prayer is a cold, barbaric act.\n“I shall be writing to the Home Office to ask them to review their intelligence on far-right terror suspects, welcome the support of Humberside Police in keeping communities safe and continue to keep in close contact with our town’s fantastic faith leaders and groups.\n“As someone who personally takes great strength from the peaceful, reflective and restorative time I’ve spent in my local place of worship, it is an earth- shattering prospect to consider how such an act of extreme violence can be meted out in such a way.”",

With businesses desperate to survive the impact of the pandemic, being left by the government waiting for clarity with only days to prepare for changes is utterly irresponsible. This deal was as far from an “oven ready” deal as possible.\nI believe that a better deal could have been negotiated, already fishing groups are lobbying me saying they are bitterly disappointed that it does not offer them the control of waters they were promised, UK service industries are not included in the deal and face additional fees and barriers, and crucially it does not include access to the European Arrest Warrant (this was used to bring terrorists to justice after the London bombings in 2005).\nBrexit has already happened and there is no time left to negotiate something better. I have been constant about my belief that we need a deal and that a no deal would be a disaster.\nSome people are saying that Labour should abstain, but I believe that Labour cannot sit on the side-lines and abstain on the biggest issue that has defined a decade of politics. The overwhelming message from residents, in emails, conversations, messages and through my survey is now we have left the EU the majority of residents want a deal.\nWe cannot walk away from tough decisions. I care about what happens to businesses and people in Hull West and Hessle and if I can stop a no deal Brexit then I will. A future Labour government can improve this weak deal. We have a duty to act in the national interest and so despite its many failings I will vote for the deal and continue to hold this government to account for the way they have let us all down.\nI want a race to the top, I want a more equal and fair society, I want real devolution of power, action on climate change and a genuine, sustained investment in our area. Now together, let’s unite and focus our efforts and energy on recovering from the pandemic and getting Hull West and Hessle the support we need to rebuild stronger and better than before.",

This means that public sector workers have, in effect, seen their pay been cut in the last few years. Research by the Office of Manpower Economics shows that since the pay cap was introduced, the average teacher has lost £3 an hour in pay while the average police officer has lost £2 every hour.\nCommenting on the report, Emma said “The money that public sector workers have lost out on because of the Conservative pay cap represents a significant chunk of their overall salary.\nGiven the talk on the news recently about the disagreements in the Cabinet over the pay cap I was hopeful that the government may have used today’s Urgent Question to make some concessions. I was bitterly disappointed.\nNot only did Liz Truss, the Conservative Chief Secretary, to the Treasury tell us that the government would not move an inch on its policy, she attacked Labour for asking the question.\nThis is proof, if ever it were needed, that the Conservatives do not act in the interest of working people in Hull West and Hessle. Fortunately I do. I have written to Liz Truss to reiterate my party’s calls to end the public sector pay cap and will continue to work hard to make sure the voices of my constituents are heard in Parliament.",

How can the Government prepare for the roll out if they do not know how many people it will affect?\nThe way the Universal Credit system is set up, claimants have to wait up to six weeks to receive a payment.

The Oracy All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) meeting discussion our plans for 2020, and the Holocaust Memorial Day reception in Parliament.\nI have spoken in Parliament a couple of times this week raising issues about devolution of power to the North, of which I am still concerned about because I do not want Hull to be the forgotten city of the North, I will monitor the situation and report back as soon as I get further information.\nI also spoke during the Queen’s Speech Debate on the vascular disease crisis we have in the UK and particularly in Hull, (click this link for the unabridged version ) and I am glad to say that this issue has been covered in-depth by the media across the country and hopefully by raising these concerns we can raise awareness of the illness and hopefully stop the rise in amputations we are seeing in Hull.\nBack in the constituency I have met with several businesses looking to help our communities with innovation in technology, I have spoken to a Rail Consultant looking at ways we can ensure Hull gets the rail infrastructure, rolling stock and timetabling it needs to thrive and I have done some interviews with BBC, ITV, and newspapers to promote these issues.

The announcement aimed to combat the fact that 120,000 children do not have a home and homelessness has doubled since the Conservatives took power in 2010. Mr Corbyn told the conference that families need homes and developers should ‘use it or lose it’. This phrase is credited to former Labour Leader Ed Miliband who made a similar comment on the issue in June 2013.\nThis has been a major issue in Hull recently with Hull City councillors publicly lamenting the lack of powers they have to deal with landowners who fail to get development schemes off the ground.\nResponding to Mr Corbyn’s announcement, Emma said “The council’s recent call for more powers to tackle developers who don’t develop their land shows just how real this issue is in Hull West and Hessle and it is fantastic to see the Labour Party promising these new powers to councils. How can it be right to allow some developers to hold land and do nothing with it for years and years? I want to see Hull and East Riding boom and they really can’t if prime areas remain undeveloped.\n“This Conservative government could very easily fix these issues but have stood idly by, preferring instead to play politics with people’s lives. I will work tirelessly to continue to be a strong, local voice for the people of Hull West and Hessle and hold them to account. Labour is the only party that is offering real solutions to the issues that affect real people. As Jeremy said today, we are a government in waiting. I look forward to the day when we don’t have to wait any longer and can get on with building a society that works for the many and not just the few.”",

In a highly disappointing response the Minister fudged his answer and failed to give schools and parents the assurances they desperately need.\nhttp://www.parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/68a280f0-821d-4f75-a329-bb5954d9d13a\nAnalysis by the respected Institute for Fiscal Studies shows that after taking into account inflation and the forecast rise in pupil numbers, schools will have a total real-terms cut to per-pupil spending of around 7% over the six years between 2015-16 and 2021-22.\nThe National Union of Teachers and the Association of Teachers and Lecturers have used the IFS figures to calculate what these cuts would mean for schools in Hull West and Hessle. They have found that pupils on average will have their funding cut by £306or by 7%. This equates to a £129,247 cut on average for each school in the constituency.\nCommenting after the debate, Emma said:\n“The response from the Minister was deeply worrying. Nationally schools have already had their budgets cut by £2.8 billion over the last two years. Further damaging cuts are on the horizon unless the Government changes course\nFrom my conversations with heads, teachers and parents I know the pressure schools in our area are already under. Class sizes are on the increase and we are seeing subjects dropped from the curriculum. School staff are losing their jobs or vacancies are being left unfilled.\nI will be doing everything I can in Parliament to continue to put pressure on the Government.

It can affect all women and girls of a childbearing age, regardless of race or ethnicity. It is caused by cells which normally form a part of the lining of the womb growing elsewhere in the body but still reacting to the monthly cycle of hormones which regulate a woman’s period. This reaction causes a number of symptoms, the commonest of which are chronic pain and fatigue. The physical symptoms are not only debilitating in themselves but affect many other aspects of a sufferer’s life, leading to relationship problems and difficulty in fulfilling work and social commitments. Endometriosis can be an incredibly isolating disease.\nDespite the prevalence of the condition, an Endometriosis UK study showed 476,000 British women had to visit their GP more than 11 times for a positive diagnosis and endured on average a seven and a half year wait from their first visit until a positive diagnosis. There is a huge deficit in our knowledge of the disease – both in terms of medical research and in medical practice – and this deficit urgently needs to be addressed. At the same time the serious effects of endometriosis needs to be recognised more widely. In the same study, 94% of respondents reported the disease impacted badly on their mental health and yet mental health provision is not considered as part of endometriosis treatment.\nCurrently, the only definitive way to diagnose endometriosis is by a laparoscopy. This is an invasive procedure which requires a camera to be inserted into the pelvis via a small cut near the navel. It requires a strong anaesthetic and can take days to recover. It is also the only way to monitor the progress of the disease so sufferers may have to undergo the procedure at regular intervals.\nThe current definition and criteria for statutory sick pay fails to recognise long-term conditions such as endometriosis, and statutory sick pay is available only to an employee for a linked period of sickness to a maximum of three years, which penalises people who have chronic long-term conditions\nHull University is conducting research into identifying biomarkers for the disease, in the hope of developing a non-invasive method of detecting the disease and allowing much earlier diagnosis before the more serious complications have developed. However, this vital work which could improve the lives of millions of women is being undertaken on a shoestring budget.\nThis lack of investment in research is not the only indication of the inexcusably low priority endometriosis has. The average diagnosis time for endometriosis hasn’t decreased in a decade and in the absence of a national strategy means care for those with endometriosis is a postcode lottery. We hope the launch of this report will raise the profile of this disease and give a voice to the many women whose suffering has so far gone unrecognised.\nIt is long past time for genuine and sustained action on this disease and this report calls for us to make a start by raising the profile and understanding of the severity of the impact of endometriosis, both with health professionals and the general public; much faster diagnosis; recognising endometriosis as a source of chronic disability; and significantly increased and properly funded research.”",

Following this, I will be meeting with the Minister for Small Business, Consumers and Corporate Responsibility, Kelly Tolhurst MP to discuss the ongoing situation with regards to Grotto Hire UK. For those of you who are not familiar with what is going on with Grotto Hire UK, workers have not been paid and are taking the company CEO to court for non-payment of wages.

I will be asking her to provide guidance on the proper use of isolation rooms to make sure that they do not infringe the UN Rights of the Child Convention and to help schools utilise them in a more productive way. This action alone is not enough, however, and the Government needs to look again at school funding to make sure that schools have enough money to give every child a good education and not have to resort to isolation rooms in anything but the most necessary of circumstances. Following this, I will again be out and about in the community talking to residents.\nThursday\nThursday is local election day.

I’m hoping for some decent weather and a bit of peace and quiet with my friends and family.\nThe Budget\nIt was a very disappointing Budget from the latest Chancellor, Jeremy Hunt. The most recent figures show that since December 2019, the average household is having to find an extra £3,500 for the essentials of housing, fuel and power, food, clothing and footwear, household goods and services, and transport. The Budget did little to address the needs of the majority and instead gave away at least £2.75 billion to the wealthiest 1% by scrapping pension allowance and opening-up yet another tax-loophole for them.\nI am pleased that they have listened to the campaign I have been a part of on the injustice of pre-payment meters and have asked Ofwat to instruct the energy companies to charge people using them the same rates as those who pay by direct debit. I would have liked this change to begin immediately, but users must wait until July before the changes happen. There are still issues around their standing charges which remain very high, and what happens to pre-payment rates when energy companies begin offering cheaper deals again.\nThe Chancellor appeared before the Treasury Select Committee the following week, and I was able to ask him when he was going to fulfil the promise he made to me in November that he would meet with the head of the Trades Union Congress to discuss public sector funding and pay. The TUC had written to the Chancellor and his special advisor three times since then requesting a meeting and had no response. His reply was that he is waiting for “the appropriate time.”\nSupport your local businesses\nI also brought up the plight of small businesses with the Chancellor. They don’t have time to wait to see what the economic forecast will look like in six months’ time, they need support, and they need it now. The small businesses I speak to in Hull and East Yorkshire don’t share the Chancellor’s unrealistic view that “everything is fine” and neither do the Federation of Small Businesses who said his budget “proves that small firms are overlooked and undervalued.”\nI am trying to secure a debate in Parliament about the help they need, and in the constituency, I’m encouraging people to tell me about the great local businesses they use and have been visiting as many during Easter recess and then publicising it on social media to try and give them a boost. If you know of any you think deserve a shout-out, let me know. If the government won’t help them, it’s up to us.\nDerringham Aquagreen\nI mentioned last time that there were things happening around flood prevention in Derringham. I met with the Living with Water team for a look around and to hear their plans. The area constituents had contacted me about is getting its own aquagreen, which will soak away water and prevent water runoff into gardens and flooding down the ten foots. There will also be work in other parts of the ward including verges.\nRight now, residents are being consulted over the proposed works and how they would like it to look.

Each month I try and give an outline of the work I have been doing in parliament and in the constituency so I hope you find it useful, please do feel free to reply with comments on the issues I have raised or suggestions on what I could cover in the future.\nFlood risk – action needed!\nI was invited to sit on a roundtable event in Westminster organised by The New Statesman to discuss the increasing threat from climate-change related flooding, along with were representatives from insurance and mortgage sectors and FloodRe, which operates the flood insurance levy scheme. I know things are hard and it feels like we are bombarded with doomsday news, but the facts are that sea levels are rising and warmer air means heavier rainfall. We need to be taking action now for the changes that will inevitably come.\nIn Hull and Hessle we are more aware than most after 2007 and 2013, and as a result we have the groundbreaking Living with Water Partnership. As a result, new developments are built to higher flood resilience standards than elsewhere. However, the consensus at the roundtable was government is simply not moving fast enough to address the problems we know we are going to have to solve – both at the level of individual properties and for the country as a whole.\nI also got to see their presentations and to hear their ideas on how to go about improving things around the school. I even got to watch their mini parliament in action and I am very pleased to say it was conducted thoughtfully and considerately. And yes, I’m sure you’re all now thinking what I was thinking!\nThis meeting fed into a flood risk roundtable the following week I had organised myself in the constituency. It was attended by representatives from both councils, the University of Hull, Environment Agency (EA), Humber and N Yorks Drainage Board and the Town and Country Planning Authority. It was great to get so much expert opinion involved in water management and planning the region together, and I was encouraged by the level of agreement. The EA is leading the Humber 2100+ project, which has to bring 12 Local Authorities together to agree a strategy to cope with the effects of the minimum 1m sea-level rise expected by 2100 on the Humber and its tributary rivers. Finding agreement has been difficult, and I will be doing everything I can to give the EA the tools to make it happen. Time and tide wait for no-one.\nFlood risk – action being taken!\nAs I said, the Living with Water partnership means we are better prepared and protected than most areas and I got the good news that an area in Derringham I brought to the partnership’s attention, where water run-off and blocked drains are a problem for residents every winter, is being considered for conversion to an “aqua-green” which will prevent these difficulties. The proposals will also include community involvement to develop it as a nature-friendly green space. I will be having a look at this and other sites in the Derringham area ear-marked for possible work with the Living with Water team soon.\nThe next generation\nI’m sure you all know I was a primary teacher, and I still love spending time in a classroom with children. It was a pleasure to be invited to All Saints Primary School in Hessle to speak and answer questions about Parliament with their school council committees.\nIt was heartening to see our future generation so involved in democratic decision making. If we want our politician’s decisions to better reflect what is going on in our communities then we need more people to understand and be involved in local democracy, and there were definitely some future politicians in that group!\nNewington and Gipsyville walkabout\nIt’s really important for me to see what’s going on in the constituency for myself and to hear directly from residents. As well as regular door-knocking and attending of community events, I also like to do ward walkabouts with the Police Inspector responsible for that area. This month I was in Newington and Gipsyville with Inspector Alisha Dixon. It was really helpful to hear what has been going on and what is being done. After talking to some residents it was clear there are problems with HMOs (houses in multiple occupation) and drug dealing, and I will be attending the next residents’ meeting with local councillors and police.\nI was impressed with the proactive work of councillors Gill Kennett, Tracy Dearing and Lynn Petrini in supporting local residents with these issues. Some of the problems with HMOs need to be addressed at a national level, so I will be raising the matter in Parliament.\nHuntington’s Disease\nHuntington’s disease is a neurological condition with no known cure and which is degenerative – that is a disease which gets progressively worse. It is difficult both for those with the disease and their carers, who are often partners or close family. I recently helped a constituent in connection to this disease, and as a result I met with the Hull and East Riding Huntington’s Support Group and the Huntington’s Disease Association’s Yorkshire advisor. I was told there is a lack of understanding of the disease amongst assessors for Personal Independence Payment support and that leads to a lot of unnecessary struggles and hardship. Following the meeting I submitted a set of Written Parliamentary Questions and am writing to the DWP Minister to ask for the necessary improvements.\nNational Apprenticeship Week\nI’ve been Chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Apprenticeships for quite a while now because I believe they are a really important way of gaining skills and getting on in life. They can be a great start to a career or a way of improving your prospects when you are already in work. They don’t believe they always get the recognition or support they deserve, and so National Apprenticeship Week is designed to raise their profile. I’ve already met a couple of young men doing a bodywork apprenticeship with EYMS and will be attending more events during the week.\nI was really pleased that UCAS – who are normally associated with getting people into a university – now advise on apprenticeships too. Have a look at their advice here. If you are interested in what employers think the government could do to improve things, there’s a really good Yorkshire Post article here. More information on National Apprenticeship Week here.\nEndometriosis Action Month\nAnother issue which I have been involved with for some time is endometriosis, and March is Endometriosis Action Month. This year we want to highlight the real impact of living with endometriosis. Endometriosis is not “just a bad period” and pelvic pain is not “normal” There are lots of myths around endometriosis, including that it’s just something you have to deal with. This has to change if those with endometriosis are to get the care they deserve. If you want to get involved, or just learn more, visit the campaign page here.\nAnd finally,\nAs always, please feel free to share this letter with anyone you think might be interested. I will be doing as much as I can to offer assistance and advice over the coming months and represent the constituency in Parliament; please do not hesitate to contact me if you think I can help.",

Encouraged new telecoms providers, such as MS3, during a meeting with local residents to reconsider their plans in Hessle, including the possibility of using underground cabling instead of telegraph poles.\n2. Urged each broadband provider during a meeting with all providers and Hull City Council to attempt an informal infrastructure sharing resolution, but regrettably, no consensus was reached.\n3. Corresponded with East Riding of Yorkshire Council, emphasising health and safety concerns, which contributed to the council’s decision to temporarily halt MS3’s works in the East Riding.\n4. Engaged in discussions with Ofcom, the UK’s communications regulator, to express concerns about the proliferation of telegraph poles in Hull West and Hessle and the need for resource sharing among providers. Ofcom has committed to facilitating a meeting with all service providers, including KCOM, MS3, Grain, and Connexin, to seek a collaborative solution. I have requested a meeting with Ofcom to receive updates on their progress.\n5. Explored the alleged lack of infrastructure sharing by KCOM with Ofcom and discovered that a formal complaint from one of the new companies is required to investigate this.\n6. Advocated in Parliament by raising concerns directly with the relevant minister during a debate and I’ve collaborated with other MPs who are confronting similar issues in their constituencies. We are exploring cross party solutions.\nThis Week I’ve:\n1. Arranged a meeting with Connexin. This is due to take place at next Thursday 2 Feb 2024.\n2. Written (letter below) to the Minister for Data and Digital Infrastructure, Julia Lopez MP, to inform her of what is happening and to request that further efforts are made to promote infrastructure sharing in the area.\n3. Organised another parliamentary petition, again to urge the government to take steps to promote infrastructure sharing in Hull West and Hessle.\nI will of course keep everyone updated on and responses or progress made by these actions and if you live in Hull West and Hessle then please do contact me with your concerns.",

The patients have a variety of different conditions. In December 2017, they were informed that they their monthly treatments would be reduced to quarterly treatments during 2018 before being completely removed in 2019.\nNICE guidelines neither recommend nor warn against use of this treatment and there are other CCGs, such as Lincoln, that have recently increased their use of this treatment. Several of the regions MPs, from both parties, have raised the issue with the CCGs and the Prime Minister and patients have appealed decisions on their individual funding requests.\nEmma has been provided with letters from consultants that have said that stopping the infusions will lead to an increased risk of mortality for those patients. My concern is that the CCGs are making their decisions based on funding and not on medical evidence.\nCommenting, Emma said “This is exceptionally concerning. When I met with the CCGs, they told me that these decisions were being made based upon the grounds of medical evidence but now we see letters from consultants that tell us that the removal of pain infusions would increase the risk of mortality for patients. How can these decisions possibly be in the best medical interests of the patients if taking it will increase the chance that they might die? I look forward to the opportunity to meet with the Minister and to put these concerns to him directly. My constituents, and especially those who are suffering because of these decisions, should know that I will push him to intervene with the CCG and do everything he can to get them to resume the treatments.”\nENDS",

  "https_www_emmahardy_org_uk_/https_www_emmahardy_org_uk_2021_03_16_why-i-voted-against-the-policing-crime-and-sentencing-bill/content_52.html": "by Emma Hardy MP\nAs your MP, I wanted to explain why I have voted against the Crime Bill at Second Reading.\nA bill can contain a lot of different parts and it is not possible for MPs to pick and choose the bits they like and just vote for those. So it is important for me to begin by saying that there is a lot in this Bill that I support. Some of the best parts come from campaigns by Labour MPs. Stephanie Peacock has campaigned for years on tougher sentences for dangerous driving. Chris Bryant and Holly Lynch have been working for years on ‘Protect the protectors,’ which is designed to strengthen protection for our Emergency Service workers and police officers and the prosecution of those who attack them. John Spellar has worked on improving the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) scheme. Sarah Champion on greater protections against sexual abuse by people in positions of trust. All are parts of the Bill I would gladly vote for, if we were allowed to pick and choose. At Second Reading we cannot add Amendments. These add to or change parts of the Bill, so my choice is to take it or leave it.\nSo, what is it that has led to me voting against the Bill as a whole?\nIt’s rushed\nThis is a HUGE piece of legislation that contains really big changes that will affect the lives of all of us. It is being pushed through in just two days. I believe fundamental changes to police powers should only take place after a conversation with the general public and wider consultation with experts to make sure that there are no unintended consequences. This hasn’t happened and the government are rushing it through so Ministers can avoid answering the awkward questions.\nThere’s so much missing\nBecause it is rushed, because this government haven’t consulted widely, there is much that is needed but missing from this Bill. For example, for some time I have been supporting the work of USDAW in asking for protection in law for retail staff. Only last September I raised directly with the Lord Chancellor the increased abuse shop workers were facing during the pandemic.\nMy own constituents have told me they have been spat at, sworn at, had things thrown at them and knives pulled. Many have developed anxiety and depression as a result. It’s unacceptable. The Lord Chancellor replied to me that “It is incumbent on all of us to make sure that sentencing guidelines properly reflect the role that they play…if there is more that we can do to draw the courts’ attention to the particular importance of shopworkers, we should do so.” Yet six months later there is nothing in this Bill for them.\nThe biggest thing missing in the 300 pages of this Bill is the word “women.” Every day women are harassed on the street. If the government was serious about tackling the culture of violence towards women, it could start by making street harassment a crime. But this Bill doesn’t. And it doesn’t increase minimum sentences for rapists and stalkers. And it doesn’t seek to fast-track rape or serious sexual assault cases. There is nothing to increase protection for women in any way proposed in this Bill.\nIt’s got the wrong priorities\nWhat it does propose a 10 year maximum sentence for damaging a statue, an issue that would have been on no-one’s mind a year ago, but this government see it as more deserving of their time and support than, for example, protecting half the population as they go about their business on the nation’s streets.\nIt also ignores the truth that ‘Justice delayed is Justice denied’ and buries its head in the sand over the fact that the Crown Court backlog is now at an all-time record high of more than 56,000 cases. Victims of crime are being asked to wait up to four years to get to court.\nIn that time witnesses memories fade, the burdens on victims and the relatives of victims goes unrelieved, and many victims and witnesses simply give up entirely – forfeiting the justice they deserve for the need to get on with the rest of their life. Covid has brought things to crisis but this started over ten years ago with the austerity cuts.\nSince 2010 over half of magistrates courts in England and Wales have been axed. In the same period eight Crown Court centres have been closed and the remainder now sit for 27,000 fewer days than in 2016.\nThe promise of increased sentences means nothing if the perpetrators are never convicted.\nThis Bill does nothing to address the fact criminals are literally getting away with it due to successive cuts to our justice system.\nI support Free Speech\nFinally, there are aspects to the Bill I find deeply worrying for the future of our democracy – particularly Clauses 54 to 60. I cannot comprehend how, in February, the government can claim they are so concerned about free speech that they will introduce duties on universities “to stamp out unlawful ‘silencing’ on campuses” and then, in March, introduce a Bill that effectively removes the right to protest. Freedom to protest is a key part of free speech and it is a key part of some of the most important episodes of British history. The government is starting to look as if it supports only the “right kind” of free speech. Freedom for newspaper columnists and outspoken TV presenters whose voices get heard by virtue of their position, but jail for the members of the public whose only platform is organised peaceful protest.\nDon’t get me wrong – I don’t agree with every protest I see. And yes, some are really annoying, and some are really noisy. The coach industry’s noisy, inconvenient “honk for hope” protest outside Parliament brought the issue to my attention and I am proud of the work I have done since in their support.\nHowever, there are many other protests outside Parliament that are just as noisy and just as annoying whose aims I do not agree with but I cannot, I will not, accept that their protest should be criminalised as this Bill proposes.\nThere have been people protesting outside Parliament for centuries – what makes this government believe they no longer have to listen to the people they represent? That people bringing their grievances to Parliament are, in fact, criminals? It is crucial that everyone understands that when the people you disagree with lose the right to protest, everyone loses it. You can’t pick and choose. I will never support the silencing of the British people in this manner.\nSo, what happens next?\nLabour are not in government and the Conservatives have the majority to push this Bill through Parliament regardless of my vote against. The Bill will then be heard in the Lords. Then it comes back to Parliament for something called ‘Committee Stage’ and this is where Labour will be adding amendments to try and improve the Bill. If you share my concerns, then now is the time to speak out.",

That package would be paid for by bringing in a proper one-off windfall tax on energy giants – which Labour says the government has so far failed to do, and it would mean:\n- A new measure to pass on savings to households immediately, by stopping the energy price cap going up from April. Right now, government plans expose households to a major new spike in prices in April.\n- A new “insulation jump start” – a pot of funding that the government could use right now to supercharge home insulation across the country, saving families hundreds off their bills.\n- Ending the scandalous penalty imposed on prepayment meter customers, saying they will ensure customers do not pay more than those paying by direct debit, alongside a 3 month moratorium on the forced installation of pre-payment meters.\n- Offering off-grid households equivalent support, with funding available for households in Northern Ireland.\nIt follows Labour’s recent call for the government to rule out a fuel duty rise at the Budget, if OBR projections show it’s affordable.\nIf there is additional headroom in the upcoming Budget, the party is calling for it to go towards the cost of living crisis as a priority, starting by ensuring that fuel duty will not rise in the Budget.\nLabour Shadow Chancellor, Rachel Reeves outlined the package, saying:\n“Millions of households are still looking to a 40 percent increase in their energy bills, in April.\n“On a week when temperatures fell below zero, I know many families and pensioners will be feeling the pressure particularly acutely.\n“And at the same time, energy companies continue to enjoy record profits. That cannot be right.”\nCommenting on Labour’s long term plan, Hull West and Hessle MP Emma Hardy said:\n“Residents in Hull West and Hessle are facing extraordinary challenges and the cost of living crisis is really taking it’s toll on the community, sticking plaster politics over it is simply not enough.\nThat is why Labour has a plan to reach one hundred percent clean power by 2030 and retrofit millions of homes.\nThese policies could save a typical household up to £1,400, generating savings not just for one year but for every year to come.”",

Nobody should make any excuses for the shameful actions of the criminals who have been attacking police officers, looting local shops, and threatening local residents.\nFollowing this violence, I’ve been contacted by ethnic minority communities who are feeling unsafe to go about their everyday lives. There are international nurses feeling scared to walk home alone, Muslim women frightened to go out shopping or let their children play outside. We cannot ignore the racism, particularly Islamophobia, which fuelled this violence. Any racially motivated violence, physical or online, is unacceptable and has no place in our society or in our city.\nI know from speaking to resident many people have legitimate concerns about immigration and these concerns must be discussed and addressed. As your MP I am more than happy to have these discussions with you and listen to your thoughts. I will always do what I can to help, and if I disagree then I will do so with respect and understanding.\nOn a more positive note, amongst the chaos and violence we witnessed over the weekend, I also saw the true spirit of our city. Lots of people came out to help clean up the mess and many others have sent me messages condemning the actions of those involved in the unrest on Saturday and support for the minority communities who were targeted. This is the true representation of Hull: far more good and decent people than there are criminals.\nI strongly believe we can disagree without harming each other and our surroundings. We don’t have to agree politically but we need to show a united front that this violence is unacceptable, and ensure Hull is a safe place for everyone. I know as a city we are resilient and will bounce back stronger. If I’m your MP and you have concerns you wish to discuss with me regarding the events which unfolded in our city then please get in touch. I am always happy to listen to the views of residents.\nStay safe everyone.\nEmma",

I was then able to use all this information to prioritise what to tackle in the constituency and what to address in Parliament in the year ahead.\nSince October I have met with Hull City Council to address some of these issues directly. This was the case with concerns regarding cuts to a small local bus service that people rely on and with getting the backing and funding to reinstate the Pickering Park Aviary.\nThrough meeting and putting pressure on Highways England, I forced them to agree to begin work on the development of the A63, Castle Street underpass scheme, which was a very pleasing result for such a long standing campaign.\nInvolving myself in other campaigns to stop education funding cuts and prevent surgical mesh being used on the NHS, has made a huge difference, as well as championing charities such as Giroscope who support a volunteer scheme to make affordable housing for people in Hull West and Hessle.\nMy time in Parliament has enabled me to put pressure on the government to give more money to the Humberside Police and relay concerns of cancer treatment medication being stopped too early due to funding cuts. Then in July this year I was delighted to hear that after months of asking the Government to provide funding for the new Hull CAMHS mental health unit, they have released the money and it is due to open in early Autumn next year.\nI would like to say a huge thank you to everyone who got involved with The Big Conversation 2017. It provided me with the essential guide I needed in order to represent you all as my constituents and I hope you will help contribute to my next Action Plan by getting involved in The Big Conversation 2018.\nGet involved – here",

In the immediate aftermath of the lockdown Universities were faced with the challenge of moving their courses online, helping students to access those courses, confusion over accommodation, hardship funds, exams, awarding degrees – a seemingly endless barrage of problems all requiring prompt and robust solutions.\nDuring the first months of the crisis the DfE chose to sit on its hands. When called to act in support of universities it deferred to their independent status, generic business support or to the role of the Office for Students and left the sector to its own devices. Fortunately, higher education is populated with dedicated, adaptable and resourceful people and I would like to commend you all for coping with the pandemic as well as you did.\nThen the financial implications for the future started to roll in.\nThe Institute for Financial studies IFS gave its central estimate of total long-run sector losses at £11 billion – more than a quarter of the usual income in one year.\nUniversities are unlikely to be able to claw back a large portion of these losses through cost savings unless they make significant numbers of staff redundant. In the IFS central scenario, they estimate that cost savings could reduce the overall bill by only £600 million or around 6% without redundancies.\nThe London Economics paper on the “Impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on University Finances” predicted a total of 60,000 jobs could be lost in the sector.\nThe IFS study predicted thirteen universities, educating around 5% of students, would end up with negative reserves and so may not be viable in the long run without a government bailout or debt restructuring.\nIn some regions our universities are one of the few graduate employers and any job losses will have a negative impact on the local economy in which a university resides. Of the 60,000 job losses predicted by the London Economics paper, 30,000 were in the local community and the total amount of lost spending in local economies was a staggering £6.1bn.\nThe government must understand that you can’t level up by shutting down.\nThe Government’s response to the looming university financial crisis has been to launch an attack on the sector: accusing it of offering “low value degrees”; astonishingly implying that if you don’t come from a family where your parents have gone to university you could be tricked into attending university.\nThere is a real opportunity for true social mobility and revolutionary change in the makeup of universities if the universities all deliver on their 5 year widening opportunities and access plans, the government should be doubling down on this commitment rather than throwing widening participation targets under the bus by the University Minister telling the Education Select Committee “it doesn’t matter about looking at which groups don’t get to university.”\nHaving rejected proposals for both a sector-wide guarantee and then targeted bailouts, the government has now announced its Higher Education Restructuring Regime, which, in its opening remarks by Gavin Williamson, declares “it is not a guarantee that no organisation will fail”.\nLabour cannot countenance the loss of a single university because we cannot countenance the equal loss of opportunity. At a time when the country is facing the possibility of the deepest recession in its history – when unemployment is set to soar and when retraining and reskilling will be more needed than ever – the Government’s position is beyond rational comprehension.\nThe Higher Education Restructuring Regime also threatens the total breadth of provision the institution provides in its area.\nWholesale course cuts would create regional “cold spots” leaving a geographical area without adequate provision. Local provision is vital for so-called “commuter students” who are predominantly from the most disadvantaged groups – part-timers, low-income families, mature and BAME students.\nInstead of the government supporting Life Long Learning we could instead see a reduction of opportunity and aspiration at the local level for those who need it most at the worst possible time.\nAny University forced into accessing a loan through Higher Education Restructuring Regime must consider, amongst other things: ending “duplication of courses”; whether level 4 or 5 courses may be more appropriate; and whether local FE institutions might be better placed to offer them. These considerations must be placed in context and recognise the economic reality facing FE.\nIt cannot be overstated that FE has been defunded to the tune of £1.4 billion a year in real terms compared to 2010 levels. This government have offered only a £300 million sticking-plaster. There is very limited capacity to relocate students to local FE. In fact, if what we’re hearing is right, in the face of current crisis half of FE colleges are planning on making redundancies.\nGavin Williamson’s talk of “rebalancing” funding between FE and HE makes it sound as if resources have been pulled from FE into, HE. This is not the case. It was a Conservative Party decision to remove student number caps, create a market led university system, only offer loans and funding for degrees and cut funding to FE and adult Education. The funding, via loans, followed the market the government created.\nThe Labour Party’s position is that everyone, everywhere has the right to the education and training they need.\nWhat people need is high-quality careers advice and guidance combined with genuine choice. This means the course they want must affordable and locally available: whatever it is and whoever is providing it. For this to happen both further education and adult education must be properly funded. We need a post 18 landscape that includes even more degree apprenticeships, part-time degrees, modular courses and that is accompanied by levels of maintenance funding that makes them a realistic proposition.\nTo enable real choice for everyone the government should be focused on identifying the barriers to learning and breaking them down not establishing more.\nWe cannot ever see a situation again where Education is viewed as a privilege for the few and not a right for all. We all have a right to learn and having an educated population not only helps us individually but as a country too, no country’s economy has grown on the back of reducing access to higher education.\nIt matters which groups in society get access to university.\nIt is true that the biggest barrier preventing those born into disadvantage improving their situation is being born disadvantaged itself. Our universities are being asked to solve the problems of social mobility at the same time as child poverty is growing and the attainment gap widening, if the government are serious about social mobility then I suggest that they must tackle this problem head on.\nOur Higher Education system is not perfect and there is always more the sector can do, for example, to tackle the BAME attainment gap, support for disadvantaged students during university, the suitability of some courses and how welcoming institutions are to mature and part time students… amongst others, but I recognise the progress already made on Vice Chancellors pay and awarding grades and I would encourage the sector not to leave itself vulnerable to lazy attacks.\nThe development of blended learning has been an abject lesson in the sector’s responsiveness and willingness to evolve and this could be applied to improving the offer to those with SEND for example, to widen opportunities even further.\nLabour believe universities have a vital community and development role to play in helping the country to build back better. Many are already actively engaged in the task.\nI have read with great interest The Civic University Commission Report and its proposals that all universities develop a clear strategy, in cooperation with local partners, that is rooted in a robust and shared analysis of local needs and opportunities and I am very supportive of these suggestions.\nThe Government should be doing everything in its power to support and assist our universities. The vision Labour are keen to foster is that of universities as the powerhouses of local regeneration and of social mobility.”",

It comes on the back of Phillip Hammond, the Conservative Chancellor’s decision to include a proposal to reduce the Bank Levy in his budget on the 22nd November.\nLabour is opposing the reduction to the levy and Emma used her contribution in the debate to call on them to fund Children’s services instead.\nIn terms of Children and Young Person’s Services. the headline figures for Hull City Council are these:\n- Spending on Children and Young People’s Services is down by £19.5 million since 2010. This represents a loss of one quarter of the council’s spending power since 2010 and is just half of the £37 million that needs to be cut before 2020.\n- The average waiting time to get a diagnosis for autism is now over 14 months.\n- The Number of Sure Start Centres in the city has gone down since 2010 with 5 being cut in the city over the last year alone.\n- The number of children classed as Children in Need is up by 2068. This represents an increase of nearly 50% since 2010.\nThis is a result of a wider programme of Government funding cuts that have seen Hull City Council lose 32% of its spending power since 2010.\nEmma said “It is now nearly 8 years since the Conservative and Lib Dem Government came to power and began a programme of cuts. This has led to large cuts to Children and Young Person’s Services. While the cuts to these services have fallen hardest on women, the children and families who use them, the fallout has an effect on the economy and all our daily lives.\n“Given the desperate state of Children and Young People Services across the country, I am very surprised to see the Chancellor has made the choice to reduce the bank levy- effectively depriving the Government of funds that could be spent on vital Children and Young People Services. The Chancellor has to ask whether this Finance Bill will create the conditions to give every child the support they need to give every child the opportunity to fulfil their potential. Until we can answer yes to these questions, a reduction in the bankers levy is a luxury that we can’t afford. That’s why I’m backing Labour’s amendments and calling on the Government to provide more funding for Children’s Services before a single penny is taken off the banking levy.”",

There is an urgent need to address the challenges facing the health service, effectively contain the virus, support workers and businesses and protect the vulnerable.\nAs your MP, my job is to represent the needs of all residents. As the party of opposition, Labour’s job is to scrutinise the Government and hold it to account. We would not be doing our duty if we simply waived this Bill through. It is vitally important that this Bill does what it is intended to do in the best way possible. Those with the quietest voices in our society must be heard and nothing must be over-looked. The amendments that we are bringing forward are for the sole purpose of improving the effectiveness and the fairness of the Bill.\nPeople understand the need for temporary restrictions to our way of life. But I believe it is sensible to review this legislation every six-months, up to the proposed two years, with a vote in the House of Commons. The Bill’s powers are far-reaching, and the situation is fast-moving. It makes sense to be able to review and respond in this way.\nCurrently, the government’s proposed package of support for workers and businesses – particularly small businesses, the self-employed and those on zero-hours contracts – is inadequate. This must change. The Government must ensure everyone has enough to live on whatever their circumstances. Nor should anyone be made homeless. In line with the proposed mortgage holidays, rent needs to be suspended for those adversely affected by the impact of the crisis. The government’s three-month ban on evictions should be extended to six months, in line with the renewal period we propose for the emergency legislation.\nMyself and my office are continuing to provide advice and support for the constituency through my Facebook page, and can be contacted directly by letter, phone or e-mail.\nThank you.",

In the same period, the proportion of people saying they never see a police officer on the beat has doubled.\nLocal community champion and founder of HU4 Community Network Hub, Terry Sullivan said:\n“As police presence has declined, Pickering area has seen a huge increase in anti-social behaviour.\nMany people have approached me with concerns over the number of incidents happening, particularly on Boothferry estate, and I believe the increase is due to a lack of police presence in the community, to engage with local people and act as a deterrent. There are currently only two PCSOs covering our area and other areas of West Hull and it is simply not enough.\nI welcome Labour’s plan to bring back neighbourhood policing as I believe it will make a huge difference in the HU4 area and help clamp down on anti-social behaviour.”\nShadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper MP said:\n“The Tories have completely decimated neighbourhood policing, leaving our communities without the protection they need.\n“Knife crime has shot up putting young lives at risk, meanwhile antisocial behaviour is blighting town centres and local communities. But the neighbourhood police who could prevent crimes like this and support victims have disappeared.\n“Labour has a serious plan to bring back neighbourhood policing, with a fully-funded package for 13,000 extra neighbourhood police on our streets.\n“The last Labour government brought in neighbourhood policing, and now, after more than a decade of Tory neglect, we will restore it.”",

  "https_www_emmahardy_org_uk_/https_www_emmahardy_org_uk_2023_07_06_emma-hardy-mp-calls-for-government-to-turn-to-the-humber-for-uks-carbon-capture-and-storage/content_105.html": "It is a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for West Bromwich East. I particularly enjoyed her remarks about standing charges, with which I wholeheartedly agree.\nI will focus on carbon capture and storage. If we accept that we cannot all cheer for one individual football team, and that there is a need for many different energy producers on the pitch, we have to deal with carbon capture and storage to meet our net zero targets and decarbonise in the way we need to. I realise that many of us would like to move more swiftly towards green energy production but, if we are honest and realistic, we must accept the need for a mix that includes carbon capture and storage. I have severe concerns about the pace and scale of investment into that industry, particularly in the Humber industrial cluster.\nFor Members who are not aware, the Humber industrial cluster is the biggest carbon emitter in the country because of all the energy-intensive industries that we have there. Back in March, when the Government made their announcement about carbon capture and storage, not a single project in the Humber gained assent, despite that cluster being the biggest carbon emitter. The Government are saying that there will be a new process—the enhanced track 1 process—but, when 80% of the carbon storage facilities are off the east coast and accessible from the Humber, it seems rather illogical not to approve a project in the Humber. That does not make sense for the international businesses that are there, and that is the point.\nThese international businesses have investments in the US, Norway and Germany. Their boards are not looking particularly at the UK as the place they want to be. They are making an international investment decision. The feedback that I am getting from those different companies is that they are now looking to invest elsewhere. Collectively, those companies are willing to put about £15 billion of private investment into that technology in the Humber. They are saying that the indecisiveness—and the shock and horror that not one of their projects was approved—means that their boards are saying, “Hang on. Why are we looking to invest in the UK when we can go ahead in Germany or Norway, and the US is giving us incentives to carry out work there?” That is extremely worrying for the Humber because, to return to my earlier point, it is the biggest carbon-emitting region in the UK. If we cannot have a solution for the Humber, we cannot have a solution anywhere else.\nIt might be worth talking to the companies involved. They are telling me that the indecisiveness means that they might not be looking at the UK as a market to invest in any more.\nFor Members who are not intimately involved in what is going on in the Humber, there are two possible pipelines out to the North sea: one from Easington on the north bank, and one further along on the south bank. We are looking at both for carbon storage. In my opinion, we need to approve both projects because of the amount of carbon that the Humber emits, but as it stands, neither has been approved by the Government. The companies have not yet been given a fixed timetable on when the Government will see that through.\nAt oral questions earlier this week, the Minister for Energy Security and Net Zero told me that the Viking project was the “favoured” option, but when I speak to those companies, they say that they have not been told, “This is going ahead, and we are going to fulfil it—go for it.”\nAs it stands, the Government have not approved any of the carbon capture and storage projects for the Humber. They approved one for Teesside back in March, but they have not approved any for the Humber. The information that they are giving out is that they will do so “in due course” and that we will “hear shortly”, which is not the same as actually approving a project.\nFrance, Germany, Hungary and Norway are all moving ahead. Those international companies are making decisions now. Those in the Humber face the real possibility of carbon capture and storage infrastructure not being in place in time, in which case they will have to cease operations. These companies will then begin to move to countries where carbon capture and storage is available. Those looking for a place to invest and meet their targets will not choose the UK. Once we miss this opportunity, they are gone forever. For example, the companies are already signing 20-year contracts with Norway.\nWithout that infrastructure in the Humber, we will not meet our net zero target. According to the independent Climate Change Committee, the 2030 CCUS and hydrogen targets are essential to meeting that target. The UK has one third of Europe’s geological storage and the infrastructure and expertise from gas and oil companies. We have that huge advantage, but it is not enough.\nThe main message that I want to put across to Government is that investors and companies need certainty. They need to see unwavering commitments and action from Government. Instead, the outside world sees a slow and piecemeal bidding process that results in the UK’s largest industrial cluster being excluded from the first round.\nThe decision that was made in March was already delayed by nine months because of the political chaos in Government. These companies are already putting in millions of pounds-worth of investment. The hon. Member for Hyndburn (Sara Britcliffe) can shake her head all she likes, but I recommend that she goes to speak to these companies. They are telling me that jobs are at risk in the Humber and that the decision was delayed because of the political chaos in Government. Those are the facts. The Government’s indecision is resulting in £15 billion of private investment being put at risk along with the Government’s ability to meet their net zero target. Those are the facts, whether she likes them or not.\nOur international reputation is being permanently damaged. When I talk to these companies, they tell me that they no longer trust the UK Government and the UK Government’s ability to keep a promise and fulfil their commitments. That international reputation is essential if we want international investment from those companies.\nAbsolutely. The UK is unique in wishing to have a bidding process. In the USA, if a company says that it can reach the target needed for carbon capture and storage, that project is approved. In the UK, we have a bidding process instead, which means that companies have to invest money in entering the process to begin with, without the knowledge or certainty that they will be approved, even if they can evidence the gains in carbon reduction.\nThe least that the Humber needs is clarity. When does the Minister expect to move forward with track 2? The track 2 decisions on transport and storage need to be announced alongside decisions on key capture sites in the Humber, with confirmation—this is crucial—that the pipeline will run from the Endurance aquifer to the Humber, as was originally set out for the east coast cluster. Any further delay would risk the viability of the projects.\nThe good news is that, if the Government give certainty to these industries—if they meet them and provide them with the security and certainty that they need to invest—77,000 new jobs could be created in the Humber, and an industry worth £30 billion in taxable revenue could be there by 2050. That will happen only if the Government provide certainty to investors and move quickly and decisively to get all the UK’s carbon capture and storage capability on-stream ahead of our competitors. This is a one-off opportunity and the Government are dangerously close to blowing it.",

In December 2016 best estimates available indicated structural debt of £10 million and in-year budgeted deficit of a further £1 million. They have been awarded a fresh start grant.\nThe college has issued notice to UCU of the need to make 231 FTE redundancies across all 3 main sites of the College. This staffing cut represents a loss of 1 in 3 of the entire workforce and a 20% cut in teaching staff. This is to meet the Government’s imposed restriction of expenditure on staffing being n more than 65% of income.\n17% of students across all of FE have a learning difficulty and/or a disability. 17% of 16-18 year olds in FE claim free school meals at age 15. The fact there is no pupil premium at 16 means that colleges can only carve out targeted support by making savings elsewhere in their budgets. This lack of access to pupil premium shuts off a potential source of funding for Further Education colleges like Hull College.\nWhen he became Secretary of State, Damian Hinds said he would tackle burning injustices, Emma described this lack of access to pupil premium as a ‘burning injustice’.\nOn the issue of contact time, young people at Hull College have told Emma that they receive only 9 hrs a week (down from 15 previously) in contact time compared to more than 25 in many OECD countries. This reduction is due to the funding. Emma asked the Secretary of State to conduct a study into the number of hours students should expect to get in contact time and use this to calculate the funding each FE college needs.\nCommenting after the committee hearing, Emma said “Further education can be a real empowering influence to people- both immediately after school and later in life- and is something that we should be supporting whole heartedly but the levels of funding cuts to Further Education since this government took office in 2010 have been completely unsustainable and have severely damaged the delivery of FE in this country.\nThey’ve hit Hull College particularly hard. Today I identified three areas to the Secretary of State on funding cuts, pupil premium and contact hours where funding can be reformed and jobs saved at Hull College. That being said, FE needs real financial support and reform from this government to make it the learner focussed, empowering institution that we know it can be. I look forward to continuing to press the government on this issue.”",

What happens with the rest of the week is dependent on what the result of the Meaningful Vote is. I have therefore decided to slightly alter the usual structure of my ‘Week Ahead’ for this week in order to provide a more detailed picture of what my activities are likely to be. It is therefore split into what will happen if the meaningful vote does not pass and what will happen if it does. Anything that is not Brexit related will happen regardless of the result of the meaningful vote.\nMeaningful Vote does not pass\nAs I mentioned earlier in this piece, the House of Commons will be voting on the Prime Minister’s deal on Tuesday. I did not support the Prime Minister’s deal last time it was put to Parliament and very little of substance has changed this time around. I will therefore not be supporting the Prime Minister’s deal on Tuesday.\nIf Parliament votes the Prime Minister’s deal down on Tuesday then there will be a further vote on Wednesday to decide whether the UK should leave the EU without a deal. I have previously spoken about how much a no deal Brexit would hurt Hull and I will therefore be voting to avoid this cliff edge.\nIf Parliament decides that we will not leave the EU without a deal then on Thursday, we will be voting on whether to extend article 50 to give us more time to negotiate a good deal with the EU. She has made a big deal of saying that she will get the UK out of the EU by the 29th March and it is a big failure that she has been unable to secure this but we must now face reality. With just one month to go in negotiations and the Prime Minister failing to make any progress in negotiations or to shift her red lines, it is clear that extension of Article 50 is now inevitable as there is simply not enough time to legislate for and deliver an orderly Brexit on 29th March. I will therefore be voting to extend article 50 and avoid a disastrous cliff edge Tory Brexit however I my support is conditional on the length of the extension.\nMeaningful Vote Passes\nMonday\nOn Monday, I will be meeting with First Group, the owners of Hull Trains and TransPennine Express. There are currently plans to allocate a number of new units of rolling stock to TransPennine Express in the coming months as well as one new unit to Hull Trains. Hull Trains are receiving their new unit in December 2019. I will be asking First Group whether it will be possible to allocate one of the earlier pieces of rolling stock to Hull Trains rather than TransPennine Express. I will keep you informed of the decision.\nLater in the day, I will be attempting to ask a question in Education Questions. I will be focusing on school exclusions.\nTuesday\nAs well as the meaningful vote on Tuesday, I have been drawn for two questions in questions to the Justice Secretary. The topic of these questions will be 1) about the Ministry of Justice not paying the Living Wage to its staff and 2) the disparity of support services provided to someone who has been found not guilty and released after being held on remand and somebody who is released after serving a prison sentence. This is because of my constituent who was sleeping on the street after being released. I have spoken about him before here:https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2019-02-11b.595.2&s=speaker%3A25646#g596.0\nAfter this, I will be meeting with the charity Endometriosis UK and the Schools Minister Nick Gibb to discuss the implementation of Menstrual Wellbeing in the new sex and relationship curriculum. 1 in 10 women in the UK will I was delighted that, after pressure that we put onto him, the Minister has decided to include Menstrual Wellbeing into the new SRE curriculum and look forward to working closely with him to ensure that positive effects are felt from the new lesson plans. I became involved in this after meeting my constituent Kate.\nWednesday\nOn Wednesday, the Chancellor will be delivering his Spring Statement. Under the Tories working people are worse off. The Government is out-of-touch, with no idea of the reality of people’s lives and no plan to improve them. I do not expect anything of significance to come from the Spring Statement that will make the lives of people living in Hull West and Hessle any easier. I envisage making a statement on Wednesday regarding the specific contents of the Spring Statement.\nLater in the day, if there is not a vote on No Deal then I will be participating in a debate on Housing to argue for better regulation of rogue private landlords. There are 22,000 properties in Hull with a housing, health and social care rating hazard category of 1, the highest hazard rating that there is, and all these properties are in the private rented sector. The cost of repairing and removing these hazards is £23.5 million. I will be arguing that landlord licencing could help to solve this problem before it becomes a major issue.\nThursday\nOn Thursday, if there is not a vote on extending article 50, I will be returning to the constituency. My meetings will include the Ergo Innovation Centre, MS3 Networks and the Hornsea Project for Offshore wind.\nFriday\nOn Friday, my meetings will include visiting Vodafone at ResQ in Hull and Chief Superintendent Phil Ward of Humberside Police. I will also be holding my drop in surgery in Gipsyville Multipurpose Centre.",

Following this, I will be meeting with the Chief Executive Officer of BAE Systems to discuss diversification of manufacturing at Brough. Workers at BAE Systems in Brough have always been at the forefront of developing technology and manufacturing, but after meeting some of the workers recently I am becoming increasingly concerned about their sole reliance on the Hawk orders. I am glad that BAE are taking these concerns seriously and envisage making another statement after the meeting on Monday.\nTuesday\nOn Tuesday, the Education Select Committee will be holding an accountability session with Amanda Spielman, HM Chief Inspector at Ofsted and Sean Harford, the National Director of Education at Ofsted.\nLater in the day, I will be speaking in a debate on the Police Grant and Local Government Finance reports. Since being elected in 2017, I have made no secret of the fact that I feel that more money needs to come from central government for both our police and local government services. Austerity has really bitten in Hull and it is affecting the real lives of real people. The government’s scheme of placing more reliance on local areas to raise more of their own money locally is not a sustainable model for an area with a tax base as low as Hull’s and I will be telling the minister that on Tuesday.\nLater in the day I will be speaking at the All Party Parliamentary Group on Apprenticeships about raising the esteem of apprenticeships in education. I will be continuing to make the point that equality of esteem with apprenticeships can only come from equality of outcome and that there needs to be a clear pathway for progressing from a level 2 apprenticeship to a level 3 apprenticeship all the way up to a degree level apprenticeship.\nWednesday\nOn Wednesday, I will be hosting the winners of my Christmas Card design competition in Parliament. Later in the day I will be meeting with Minister Jackie Doyle Price to discuss mental health in schools and the alarming increases in the rates of suicide. I envisage making a further statement after the meeting.\nThursday\nOn Thursday, my meetings include Emma Latimer from Hull Clinical Commissioning Group, Ian Kelly from the Chamber of Commerce, Brigitta Laszlo from Ashiana- to talk about Human Trafficking and Modern Slavery, Tracy Stephens from the Fisherman’s Mission and Louise Cheeseman from Hull Trains.\nFriday\nOn Friday, I will be attending an update on the ongoing developments to Castle Street and Calvert Lane before hosting a drop in surgery.

Thousands of women have faced life-changing injuries following mesh surgery and they must not be ignored.\n“It is worrying that the new guidelines disagree with NICE guidance of December 2017 on pelvic organ prolapse, which stated mesh should only be used for research purposes. I cannot understand why NICE appears to have effectively lifted its ban on mesh for prolapse, and I have serious concerns that as a result, women undergoing mesh surgery for prolapse may not be aware of the potential risks.\n“While I am pleased that NICE is now advising against mesh as a first-line treatment for incontinence, the new guidelines fail to clearly outline that mesh should only be used once conservative methods have failed and when non-mesh surgery has failed. It is vital that a proper continence care pathway is established, with surgery as a last resort.\n“It is imperative that the new guidelines do not undermine the important work currently being undertaken by Baroness Cumberlege’s Independent Medicines and Medical Devices Safety Review, which is due to report later this year. While this is ongoing and until the safety of mesh can be proven, it must remain suspended.”\nEmma Hardy, MP for Hull West and Hessle and Vice Chair of the Surgical Mesh APPG said:\n“One of the biggest issues with this Mesh scandal was that mesh injured women felt they were not being listened to about their own bodies. Following the work done by the APPG and Sling The Mesh, it appeared as if we were moving in a positive direction but this announcement that the NICE guidelines are to be changed marks a definite backwards step.\n“To arbitrarily change the guidelines without waiting for the results of the Baroness Cumberlege review by the government is not just a betrayal of the mesh injured women, it is incomprehensible.\n“Surely it would make more sense to maintain the status quo until results of that review were published and make decisions from there? I will be working closely with the other members of the APPG to hold NICE to account for this and make sure the voices of these Mesh Injured women continue to be heard”\nKath Sansom of Sling The Mesh said:\n“We are appalled that despite political campaigns and the obvious suffering of many women, these guidelines are no different from what was published in 2003.\n“They are so weak, they clear the way for the next generation of women to be harmed.\n“We told our stories and NICE ignored us. NICE also ignored important scientific evidence showing mesh risk is at least 1 in 10 suffering, by deliberately omitting a key study of NHS figures.\n“Our Sling The Mesh survey shows 1 in 20 women have attempted suicide and more than half have regular suicidal thoughts because of chronic pain, loss of sex life, constant infections and auto immune disease.\n“These are unacceptable risks from what is sold to women as a simple fix. If a men’s operation was creating this level of harm it would have been stopped a long time ago.”",

The unfolding of events have thrown everything into turmoil and in the context of widening participation they are going to have profound repercussions for those who are at university presently, and for those who we are hoping to encourage and support through wider participation. What I have to say then is a view on where we are now and how I see it affecting widening participation in the future.\nFinances and effect on widening participation\nThe financial situation for universities is grim. I am extremely alarmed by the report commissioned by the UCU from one of Europe’s leading specialist economics consultants, London Economics, which forecasts a loss of £2.5bn to universities through the widely predicted fall in student numbers in September. It confirms what I have been hearing from representative bodies and individual Vice-Chancellors.\nI don’t believe it is scaremongering. It doesn’t take account of other income losses like accommodation or conferencing, and is based on a relatively optimistic view of the economic recovery. It is also backed up by last week’s analysis by the Office for Budget Responsibility which identified higher education as the sector most likely to take the hardest hit from the crisis.\nIt’s vital that no higher education institution should be allowed to fail. The disappearance of individual institutions will have a disproportionate effect on those we would be seeking to encourage and support to enter higher education through widening participation. It risks creating higher education “cold spots” in the country – regions where there is no local access to a higher education institute. This impacts widening participation in two main ways.\nFirst, most higher education institutes engage in outreach activities into their local schools and communities delivering a wide range of activities both on campus and in schools and colleges and for all age groups. This is vital in raising awareness of higher education and to cultivate the self-belief in individuals, so often a barrier, that this is something they can actually do. Without these interventions university will remain distant not just literally, but mentally and emotionally too.\nSecond, we know that commuter students – students who do not live on campus but remain in their homes, either with their parents or in those they were living in before attending – are predominantly composed of those from most disadvantaged groups in society. They are the part-time students, students from low-income backgrounds, BAME, parents, carers, mature students. The vast majority of them would simply not be in higher education without it being locally available.\nI have seen the University UK proposals for a comprehensive package of support from Government that will ensure the long term security of the sector and I completely support them. I am having regular online meetings with Michelle Donelan and she has intimated that the Government won’t let any university go to the wall. However, it looks like the Government want to avoid any sector wide deal and treat things on a case-by-case basis. They also seem to see mergers and acquisitions as the way to keep all institutions afloat. The OfS, when I spoke with them, seemed very aware of the role some universities play as anchor institutions in their communities and the damage that would be caused should any of them fail, which I found somewhat reassuring.\nStudent’s own finances are an area that is going to hit the most disadvantaged because it also affects access and opportunities, not just the nitty-gritty of meeting daily living expenses.\nStudents from low-income backgrounds will have been supporting their studies with work – as well as, obviously, most part-time students. These jobs are most likely to have been zero-hours or casual contracts that will not give access to the Furlough Scheme. Nor can full-time students claim UC as they are not actively seeking work. The Government is not interested in relaxing UC rules around this. Nor are they interested in using the SLC to get extra funds out. I was told they simply don’t have the capacity.\nA particular issue for final year students in Conservatoires for drama and music, which will disproportionately affect disadvantaged students, was brought to my attention this week. The end of year performances, as well as being the only way to really assess the students, act as auditions for future employment. Agents attend to watch, it’s a chance for the students to network and so on. These will have to be undertaken in the next term and are providing challenges for the institutions – which are small and not well resourced financially. These are mostly in London so students lacking financial support are really going to struggle. It’s an area where students from lower socio-economic backgrounds are poorly represented as it is, so this is a real kicker for those that have made it this far.\nThere is plenty of concern that the drop out rate amongst those students who don’t have recourse to extra funding – the bank of Mum and dad or whatever – is going to increase. It’s tragic that a lot of these are likely to be the ones that have been brought in through widening participation.\nThere has been a lot of support for the establishment of a Student Hardship Fund which would provide universities with funding to allocate to students in need – probably on the basis of eligibility for a maintenance loan. The Government’s only comment so far has been to suggest that students approach their own universities for assistance. In an answer to a Written Question, Michelle Donelan said “Many universities have hardship funds”. This contains an acknowledgement that some do not so it is not a comprehensive solution in any way. We are going to keep pushing on this.\nMental health and disabilities\nI said the drop-out rate would be increased by the extra financial struggles brought on by the crisis but of course the upheaval, stress and uncertainty will have put an intolerable burden on those students who had existing mental health problems or conditions like autism. I have raised this issue with MD personally, and she seemed to view it as a serious problem, not just for the students with pre-existing conditions but as a wider mental health issue for all students. Having said that, in a reply to a Written Question this Monday she made no suggestion that the Government intended to show any leadership on this issue, saying only “it is vital that students can still access the mental health support that they need” but leaving it up to individual institutions to deal with saying: “Many providers are bolstering their existing mental health services and adapting the delivery of these services to means other than face-to-face. These services are likely to be an important source of support to students during this period of isolation.” There is a consistent line emerging that whatever the issue, the ball is in the universities’ court.\nDigital access\nAs higher education has very quickly moved to provision of online content, it has shone a very bright light on the issue of digital poverty, while at the same time increasing the disadvantage for all those on the wrong side of it. I think there is an assumption that all young people (which are the only type of people to attend university of course) are plugged into the internet 24/7 and have all the latest devices. This is very far from the case. A smartphone with a data cap is not a laptop or PC with an unlimited data allowance. Many will have had access through free wifi in their accommodation. Now they are at home. It is likely that the homes of those widening participation is trying to reach will not be afforded the same facilities and ease of working that others have.\nI am also excited by a campaign for “data plan whitelists”. A letter proposing this idea and signed by representatives of Jisc, AoC, UUK and UCISCA was sent to Gavin Williamson this week. Downloads generated by visiting designated educational websites, accessing online libraries for research papers, Virtual Learning Environments, video lectures and so on, would be counted as free data on any student’s data plan. It’s a great idea and one that I believe should be maintained indefinitely as a way of supporting widening participation in the future.\nThe sudden move to online learning has also raised concerns on how well certain disabilities are being catered for – e.g. subtitles on all material for the deaf.\nWidening participation in the future\nEffects on next year’s cohort\nBut what about the efforts to widen opportunities for next year? There are real worries from some quarters that we are in danger of overlooking an entire cohort. Sixth forms and colleges are closed. I know they are doing their very best to support their students, but it is exactly the students we are concerned with in this discussion who will suffer most from missing the support and encouragement that comes from the personal relationships they have with peers and teachers, and the confidence gained from being a part of a group all headed in the same direction. Applying is a complicated and daunting prospect for many 18 year olds. If they are from a home where they would be the first in the family to go to university it puts them at an obvious disadvantage to those whose parents have been through the process themselves and will have an expectation that their child will make the same transition.\nAs there will be no exams this year, students are relying on an assessment process to provide the grades on which their access to higher education depends. I understand this will take in more than predicted grades, but there still remains the concern, to me at least, that because predicted grades have been shown in the past to discriminate against disadvantaged and BME students this will result in fewer getting into higher education this year. I would suggest it would make it less likely that they would be able to take advantage of Adjustment this year. I know this process is used by Cambridge University to attract disadvantaged students who have done better than they (and their teachers) expected.\nCommuter students\nI mentioned commuter students earlier and I’d like to return to them as we consider the future. The economy is retracting, unemployment will rise and as we attempt to find the “new normal” universities are going to have a central role to play in both training a new generation and reskilling older ones. We are likely to see an increase in commuter student numbers. As it is, they make up to 50% of the intake at some universities. This wouldn’t be a cause for concern if it weren’t for the fact that they have poorer academic outcomes than their on-campus peers. If we are going to see an increase in their numbers – and in all likelihood we are – then we really need to address this difference in outcomes. From what research there is it seems there is not a clear answer. The issues seem to be not simply those arising from these students being more likely to be from economically disadvantaged and BME groups. In fact commuter students are not a homogeneous group – they come from a variety of circumstances and backgrounds and consequently very few universities collect data on them or necessarily recognise them as a group. The existing evidence seems to suggest that the amount of engagement in activities beyond the lecture theatre has an effect and that while the universities do not always appreciate the barriers to engagement and proactively encourage involvement, the students themselves do not always recognise the value in them. This is certainly an area I believe needs further attention, not least from the Government who at the time of the Augar report’s commissioning were keen to increase commuter student numbers.\nHow do universities monitor widening participation and how is it reported?\nIf you flick through any university’s prospectus and you will find a section detailing their commitment to widening participation and statements on how much they value diversity and education as a force for social good. They all have WP teams, organised events, outreach activities and so on.\nBut who decides what WP actually is, how is success going to judged and what are the consequences for perceived failure? Different answers to these questions will have a profound effect on which students get access to university. As I understand it, the Office For Fair Access (OFFA) oversaw WP and had a stated strategic objective that ‘All students, from all backgrounds, with the ability and desire to undertake higher education, are supported to access, succeed in, and progress from higher education.’ OFFA seemed to take a whole-sector view of the issue with an expectation that individual universities did the same by asking them to think about how their evaluation, approaches and outcomes in their own institutions could contribute to the sector as a whole. A collegiate approach in other words – encouraging them not to become fixated with their own metrics.\nThis responsibility has now passed to the OfS, which has taken over – or “absorbed” OFFA. OfS have asked universities to create “access and participation plans” of up to a maximum of five years duration. OfS see it as their job to ensure “that the providers honour the commitments they make to students in these plans, and take action if they do not.” I honestly don’t know what kind of “action” will be taken, but it does potentially sound like the carrot and the stick, without the carrot. So how should the plans be drawn up and under what criteria will they be judged? As an echo of the OFFA approach OfS asks that in their submitted plan an institution should “consider their role in the national context using sector-wide evidence and data” but, significantly I think, adds “including the OfS key performance measures”. It also asks that they “reference the sources of data used in the assessment of performance which includes the OfS access and participation dataset” This sounds like they will be taking a central role not just in judging a higher education establishment’s performance in widening participation – fair enough, someone has to – but in setting the criteria by which that performance is judged. And failure to meet those criteria will have consequences. I think it is important therefore that those success criteria are flexible enough to allow for the particular circumstances of individual institutions and for a plurality of approaches to solving the challenges of widening participation. I hope a genuinely open and meaningful dialogue is maintained between OfS and the higher education community on this matter because ultimately it is the life chances of real people that are being affected and it is one I shall be paying attention to.\nThe Covid 19 crisis has highlighted and exacerbated existing inequalities for current students. It is looking extremely likely that it will alter the future higher education landscape in profound ways and this will pose some fundamental questions and challenges to widening opportunities. We must be ready to protect current provision and to take the opportunities that will present themselves to argue for the importance of improving access to higher education for all.",

Following this, I will be attempting to ask a question to the Home Office about how we build a future immigration system that is fit for purpose. Specifically, I will be raising the case of a constituent of mine who came to the UK and married an EU citizen. She subsequently discovered that her husband had been committing bigamy when he married her, meaning the marriage was null and void and has no status in the UK. I’ll be asking the minister what more can be done.\nFollowing this, I will be speaking in a debate about Cystic Fibrosis and pressing the government to do more to reach a deal with the US supplier of the drug Orkambi to provide the drug in the UK. Cystic Fibrosis is a condition that affects 10,000 people in the UK and half of all deaths happen to people who are under the age of 31. The drug has been licenced for three years and, while there is no cure for Cystic Fibrosis, it goes a long way to helping treat the symptoms. The government has to do more to make sure a deal is reached.\nTuesday\nOn Tuesday, the Education Select Committee is to question Children’s Commissioner for England Anne Longfield. The session will be a chance for the Committee to ask about her work in areas such as knife crime and school exclusions, as well as other issues relating to her role protecting and promoting the rights of children. I will be asking her about my ongoing campaign to provide guidance to schools about how and when to use isolation rooms in a way that does not contravene the UN Charter on the Rights of the Child and promotes good education in our schools.\nFollowing this, I will be meeting with Family Action and Magic Breakfast about the National School Breakfast Programme. You may have seen the recent media attention about the 23000 children who are living in poverty in Hull. I have organised this meeting to investigate whether their programme may be a method of helping to alleviate that poverty in the city. It is only part of the solution but I believe it will definitely play a part.\nI will also be chairing an event run by the National Association of Head Teachers on Relationships Education. You will have seen the controversy in the news at the moment where some parents are protesting the inclusion of aspects such as LGBT+ education in schools. This is an event\nFinally, I will be intervening in the debate on House Building Targets in Westminster Hall to raise the issue of land banking, where property developers gain planning permission for a piece of land and then hold on to it to in order to wait for the value of the land to rise. This includes areas of historic importance like Land Line. This is a significant issue in Hull and is one that I will be pursuing further. I am currently in talks with a number of organisations with the aim of introducing a private members bill into Parliament to try and address the issue.\nWednesday\nOn Wednesday, I will be speaking in a debate on inequality and social mobility. I will be using my contribution to further detail my plan for a future Hull that attracts new industry such as modular homes, develops skills and takes advantage of our unique place in the country to make the city really work for our residents. I will also be attempting to catch the Speaker’s eye during Prime Minister’s Questions and will release details of the question I will ask closer to the time.\nThursday\nOn Thursday, my meetings include Michelle Swithenbank from Hull College, the Alzheimers Society and FareShare.\nFriday\nOn Friday, I will hold my regular Tesco Drop In Surgery and will also be meeting with Shane Walker of Walker Modular Homes. I am visiting Walker Modular Homes with the Chair of the Humber Local Enterprise Partnership, Lord Haskins as part of my ongoing project to try and promote the building of modular homes as a specialist industry in Hull. We have a history of building caravans here and the modular homes market is growing and one in which caravan building skills could be easily translatable and could bring lots of jobs to the city.",

She is working closely with Hull North MP Diana Johnson and they have a joint meeting with the Hull Chamber of Commerce and TransPennine on Friday 9th March.\nAlongside the fact that it will be decades before Hull sees any improvements to our rail infrastructure, it is totally unacceptable to Hull passengers and our business community that Hull will soon be seeing a slower Transpennine rail service. This is not an ‘improved’ service.\nCommenting, Emma said: “The downgrading of the Transpennine Express’ service to Hull to a ‘stopping service’ is completely unacceptable. It is a positive step forward that the government is moving to help connect small local communities but it is vital that Hull also has an express service to cities like Liverpool and Manchester.\n“We cannot continue with a post code lottery on rail and road spending in the UK, northern cities need to be connected and the government needs to act to make sure they are sooner rather than later.”",

These debates have only happened because of Labour MPs securing Westminster Hall Debates and because of the Backbench Business Committee. Many of us felt there was insufficient time to properly debate the issue of climate change and many colleagues who wanted to attend were unable to do so.\n“Each debate has included a clear ask of the Government to allocate significant time to this issue within Government time in the House of Commons.\n“The Independent Climate Change Committee, Members from all sides of the House, non-governmental bodies and scientists have all said we need to debate this issue more fully and take action with more urgency.\n“We therefore call on the Government to commit to allocating at least one full day of Government time to this issue, perhaps in response to the advice from the Climate Change Committee on reaching net zero emissions targets, and for that debate to be led by you as Prime Minister.\n“Following the Climate Strike and Extinction Rebellion protest, David Attenborough’s ‘Climate Change- the facts’, Greta Thunberg’s excellent campaigning and increasing evidence, surely the least the Government could do is provide time to debate how the UK- and indeed our partners around the world- will meet zero and negative emissions sooner rather than later.”",
  "https_www_emmahardy_org_uk_/https_www_emmahardy_org_uk_2025_03_07_community-newsletter-february-2025/content_4.html": "Dear Friend,\nI hope this finds you well. I don’t usually start my newsletter with international politics, but recent events have left us facing a once-in-a-generation moment for the collective security of our country and our continent. As a leading European power, the UK must play its part, which is why the Labour government will continue to work closely with our European partners and increase our defence investment to 2.5% of GDP. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has provided global leadership in support of the brave people of Ukraine and President Zelenskyy, making it clear the UK will continue to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Ukraine in its fight to secure its sovereignty and a just and lasting peace.\nTelecomms infrastructure sharing\nOn 4 February I met with Chris Bryant, Minister for Data Protection and Telecoms, regarding the pole infrastructure sharing trials taking place in Hull. The purpose of the trials is to lead to an agreement that allows sharing of infrastructure, meaning no new poles or trench digging – something everyone in the area wants to see.\nThe following week, I met with the KCOM CEO Tim Shaw and MD of Enterprise Jan Collins. They updated me on progress of the infrastructure sharing trials with MS3 and Connexin.\nI was told one company has begun successfully connecting customers in their trial and it is hoped the other will begin doing so by the end of February. I will continue communicating with all the companies involved and do whatever I can to get an agreement as soon as possible.\nVeterans Minister visits Hull\nI was delighted to take our Veterans Minister, Alistair Carns, to meet local veterans and see the wonderful work Hull4Heroes Armed Forces Community Hub Hull and University of Hull are doing through their Veterans Career Transition programme.\nThe programme is funded by the government via the Armed Forces Covenant Fund Trust, and focuses on career development, designed specifically for veterans and their families who wish to transition from professions in the armed forces to new, fulfilling career paths.\nAlistair told me he was incredibly impressed with the programme and the support we give, as a city, to our ex-servicemen and women.\nRemembering our lost fishermen\nThe winter months were always the most hazardous for the fishermen from Hull in the icy waters of the far north and this time of year sees the anniversaries of many tragic losses.\nOn 5 February I attended a service to remember the 18 Hull trawlermen who lost their life at sea on the Ross Cleveland, and on 10 February I attended the memorial service for the 30 crew members from Hull and six crew members from North Shields who lost their lives 51 years ago on the Gaul. Both services took place on Hessle Road, which for so many years was the beating heart of Hull’s fishing community.\nIt was really encouraging to see so many people of all ages attend these services. We will always remember those from our community who lost their life at sea.\nCity Centre Development Delays\nI am deeply concerned that many of our city centre projects are falling behind schedule and exceeding their budgets. This includes the renovations of Queen’s Gardens, the old BHS building, and William Booth House.\nQueen’s Gardens, in its current state, is an eyesore and a deterrent for visitors. Keeping it closed for another full summer would be detrimental to city centre businesses. I wrote to the leader of Hull City Council, but the reply I received was disappointing. It confirmed that the work would not be completed before the end of summer and that the cost, which has now risen to £21.1 million, remains an “estimate.” We all want this project to succeed and I hope it is getting the attention and focus it needs.\nIt has been nearly a year since Hull City Council purchased William Booth House. Local residents were promised they would be involved in discussions about the building’s future. However, almost a year later, they are still in the dark. I have written to the leader of Hull City Council again, asking when we can expect action and when the promised consultation with local residents will take place.\nWhile it’s good news that all the asbestos has now been removed from the old BHS building, I was in town recently, and the site looks worse than when the scaffolding was up! The asbestos removal process took nearly two years, but discussions about the next phase of the project only began this week. Surely, these discussions could have been taking place while the work was ongoing?\nOn top of these delays, we are also facing setbacks with the A63 project. I’ve met with National Highways several times, and the delays are not due to a lack of funding or workforce. They are a result of complications during the build. The funding is in place, and the workforce is available—if they weren’t, I would be the first to ask the government to intervene. I will be having regular meetings with them and will keep you all updated on progress.\nI’ve also spoken with many businesses affected by these delays. They’ve suggested practical actions Hull City Council could take to support them, including having a bus stop and a taxi rank. At the beginning of the year, I wrote directly to Hull City Council, requesting they help fund a bus service to The Marina. I have yet to receive a response and have written again to ask about the possibility of setting up a taxi rank and improving signage to show that businesses are still open.\nI am disappointed with the lack of action from the Council regarding the city centre. There are steps they could be taking right now and commitments they could be making, but for some reason, they aren’t. I genuinely worry that having so much of our city centre out of action for such a long period will cause lasting damage and I really encourage you all to shop locally and use our shops and services in the centre.\nExtra NHS appointments and falling waiting lists\nSome good news! 2 million extra NHS appointments have happened since your Labour government was elected in July. As a result waiting lists have fallen by 160,000 from their record high under the last government.\nWe know that the job of fixing our NHS is a huge one, but this a really positive step in the right direction, and we will continue to do everything we can to ensure Hull West and Haltemprice residents have an NHS that works for them.\nLabour has announced 700,000 more NHS dental appointments across England to tackle the immediate crisis in access many people face and will mean an extra 27,000 appointments will be available in our region from April.\nYou can access them by contacting your NHS dentist. If you are not registered with an NHS dentist, you can call 111.\nThese additional appointments will allow patients to access the urgent dental care they need while we get on with our plan to reform NHS dentistry, which includes focusing on prevention, better retention of NHS dentists, and reforming the NHS dental contract to increase capacity.\nEYMS bus services\nI keep in regular contact with EYMS over the bus services as I know important it is for local residents. After I contacted them last week about cancellations of the 56 service they replied:\n“We have a number of changes coming in from this weekend where we have made the decision to reduce the frequency on 44, 51, 56, 57 and 58 which reduce the daily requirement for vehicles and drivers and should allow a more regular and reliable service. Looking at staff availability for next week, this is much improved so customers should see a more regular and reliable service.”\nThis cannot be a permanent solution, but I hope it will at least mean people aren’t stood waiting for a bus that isn’t coming until EYMS sort out their driver shortages. I want to assure you that I will continue conversations with EYMS while they address these issues because residents must have the frequent and reliable bus services they need.\nThe revised timetable is here.\nFree Breakfast Clubs rollout\nI’m pleased to see the first phase of our promise of free breakfast clubs in primary schools being rolled out, and even more pleased that it includes two in the constituency – Willerby Carr Lane and Ganton.\nI believe that every child deserves to start the day well fed so they can concentrate at school and have the best chance to achieve their dreams, and breakfast clubs are proven to boost attendance and attainment. They will increase parents’ work choices and children’s life chances, as well as saving parent’s an estimated £450 a year.\nBusiness of the week\nThree more featured fantastic local businesses this month: Metro Gym Hull, The Dog House, and Wishes of Willerby.\nWorks on the Common, Anlaby\nI was alerted to work taking place on the Common in Anlaby, with diggers removing bushes and scrub by residents concerned with the destruction of wildlife habitat. I immediately contacted East Riding Council, the Environment Agency, Natural England and Anlaby Parish Council, and through them the landowners.\nI met residents at the Common that week to hear from them in person and attended the Parish Council meeting a few days later at which the works were discussed.\nThe Parish Council made a statement they had received complaints about the state of the land, including issues with fencing, fly-tipping, and the maintenance of hedgerows and trees, as well as concerns about the welfare of horses and ponies there. As Anlaby Common is private land they then contacted the landowners, Central Land Holdings, to address these issues. In response, the landowners promised to undertake remedial works including clearing rubbish, cutting hedgerows, and repairing the fencing. This is the work which has been the subject of complaints.\nThe statement in full is here.\nThe land currently has no special nature protections but is a valuable green space that frequently floods. With the rate of flooding on this land set to increase, I don’t believe developing this land is a sensible idea. While it is private land, I have requested a meeting with the land managers and am willing to work with all the parties involved to find a win-win solution.\nAnd finally…\nAs always, I’m here to support you. If you have any questions, concerns, or ideas about how I can help, please don’t hesitate to get in touch. You can email me at emma.hardy.mp@parliament.uk or call my office at 01482 219211. Leave a message if I’m unavailable, and I’ll get back to you as soon as I can.\nBest wishes,\nEmma",

It was heavily criticised and amended in the Lords with support from members of all political parties. Despite the misgivings of a number of Conservative MPs, the government defeated all the amendments in the Commons.\nThe legislation flies in the face of the 1951 Refugee Convention to which this country was a founding signatory. This Convention, and the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), were a response to the refugee crisis that gripped Europe following the Second World War. At this very moment, as countries across Europe are once again having to act swiftly to help millions of refugees from Ukraine, this government is passing legislation to tear up its shared obligations and criminalise those fleeing war. Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), which employs over 35,000 personnel across 70 countries said this legislation makes the UK “one of the most anti-refugee countries in the world.”\nThe Bill will deny sanctuary to people dispossessed in the most brutal of circumstances and drag our international reputation into the gutter at the same time.\nThis part of the legislation is based on years of lies and slurs which the numbers simply do not support. The UK is 18th in the world in terms of asylum applications per head of population. Germany has taken in 800,000 Syrian refugees, Turkey currently hosts 3.7 million refugees of various nationalities. Our country is not facing a “flood” heading our way. What we do face is an incompetent Home Office which cannot deal with a fraction of the cases many of our European neighbours manage.\nIt is badly thought out and self-defeating. Not only does it encourage people trafficking by failing to establish safe routes for refugees, the Independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner has repeatedly warned that it also makes it harder to prosecute these traffickers. It will push more business the way of these ruthless criminals which they will be able to undertake with less risk.\nCurrently, thousands of refugees are in limbo in this country because the Home Office put in place rules which depended on reaching bilateral returns agreements with our European neighbours and then failed to do so, despite it being their “number one priority.” Millions are being spent in accommodation and subsistence with no end in sight.\nHowever, the cost of the proposals to set up off-shore asylum processing centres will dwarf this, running into billions. They have brought condemnation from all sides, with Conservative MP and former minister Andrew Mitchell saying of them “Judged by the costs of Australian offshoring the British taxpayer would face unprecedented costs per asylum seeker. It would be much cheaper to put each one in the The Ritz and send all the under-18s to Eton.” David Davis MP described them as creating “a British Guantanamo Bay”. Unsurprisingly, no country has yet agreed to host a foreign-run facility which breaches international treaties, and the potential for human rights abuses, on their soil.\nThe Bill is also an attack on the rights of British citizens. It gives the Home Secretary the power to remove citizenship in secret, with no prior warning, and effectively deny any appeal. It is fundamental to justice that a person should have notice of charges against them and a fair opportunity to present a defence. This is a move befitting an authoritarian regime, not a mature democracy.\nIt has effectively put over 6 million people who have dual nationality or have been granted British Citizenship, including two in every five people from a non-white ethnic minority background, on notice. Not long after the Home Office attempted to justify this part of the Bill by saying “British citizenship is a privilege, not a right,” the UN Secretary General, António Guterres, tweeted “having a nationality is not a privilege – it’s a human right.” This right is protected by UN treaties to which the UK is party and is obliged to protect.\nThis Bill is unjust and inhumane. It attacks fundamental human rights, international treaties and diminishes us in the eyes of the world. It will now return to the Lords where I am in no doubt it will again be amended. When it returns to the Commons I will be ready once more to fight to remove the worst aspects of a deeply flawed and regressive piece of legislation.",

This led on to meeting up with Isobel Hall who is the President of the Students Union for the University of Hull, and we discussed how some students are struggling with loans and the cost of living whilst attending the uni. There should be some national action from SU’s across the country as they will be lobbying the government on these issues.\nThey have my support!!\nI had some lunch and soon after did an interview with a new local magazine called The New Mail, keep your eyes peeled! This was immediately followed by a Butterfly City meeting over at the Aura Innovation Centre and a few more meetings before I tied the day up around 6pm.\nOf note was the excellent meeting with Rebecca Holmes, founder of the Endometriosis support group in Hull. As you know I have campaigned tirelessly for improved awareness and treatment of Endometriosis and its great to see more groups like this opening up to our constituents.\nTuesday was a family day, where I spent the day with my lovely girls and had some plain normal family time together. This is something I really do miss when I am in Westminster from Monday until Thursday evening.\nWednesday saw the launch of the DPAC (Disabled People Against Cuts) audio equipment that I have purchased for my constituency, I am sure you have seen my tweets and Facebook, but here is the link to the video explaining how this equipment will help anyone going for a PIP assessment. Please do get in touch if you need to borrow the equipment.\nThen we had the wonderful Angela Rayner visit us in Hull and I went with Karl Turner MP along with her to the Same Difference, which is an adult social care provider and does a wonderful job around Hull. It is always such a pleasure to see what amazing work you all do in our communities.\nThursday I spent with my girls again and Friday I am out campaigning for the local by-election in Hessle in support the Hessle Labour Party. (I have also had my hair cut as well ).\nSo, that is it for another week, please do get in touch with me if you are having a PIP assessment any time soon and I can provide you with the audio equipment and some advice as well.\nI hope you all have an amazing weekend and see you next week!\nEmma x",

As Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Labour Brexit team, Ms Hardy will be unable by Parliamentary rules to speak on the debate.\nThe Bill, in its current form, has some very wide ranging powers that could give Ministers the power to amend other pieces of legislation including the Withdrawal Bill itself. The Labour Party has expressed concern that the Bill could have detrimental effects on workplace rights- by, among other things, allowing the Government to remove the Working Time Directive, environmental rights and consumer rights. In its 2017 General Election Manifesto, Labour promised to bring forward an alternative repeal bill to the Government’s repeal bill which would bring about a better Brexit.\nThere have been widespread expressions of concern about the bill, from MPs of all parties. For example, Dominic Grieve, Conservative MP for Beaconsfield, called the bill ‘an astonishing monstrosity’ in the House of Commons.\nEmma said “I agree that the votes of people in Hull West and Hessle must be respected and I am fighting for a good Brexit deal to safeguard jobs, security and workers’ rights. We are leaving the EU in March 2019 because we voted to trigger article 50. This will happen whether this bill is passed or not. This bill is not about whether we leave the EU but how we leave it.\nThis is a power grab by Theresa May. She should not be using Brexit to hoard powers in Westminster. Nobody voted to take back control and powers from the EU to just give them all to Theresa May.\nThere is still time for Theresa May to listen to all these concerns before the vote on Monday and, if she does, then it is still possible for there to be agreement on this important issue and a much better bill to be introduced.”",

The letter calls on the Conservative Government to delay the planned roll out of Universal Credit to avoid hardship and increased debt for millions of families.\nThe roll out, which begins next week, will see the benefit introduced in 55 new areas a month. The introduction in Hull will take place in September 2018.\nThe letter points out how the complicated system of claiming is already struggling to cope with just 5 new areas a month having been rolled out earlier this year.\nEmma said,\n“In the recent election, I promised to be a strong local voice for Hull West and Hessle and hold the government to account on issues that matter to my constituents and that is why I have signed this letter.\n“The system for claiming Universal Credit is a shambles, even with only 5 new areas a month. According to the government’s own figures, almost a quarter of claimants wait longer than 6 weeks for their payment. Some families wait 12 weeks or more, pushing many into rent arrears. or a spiral of debt that, given how low Universal Credit payment are, is almost impossible to get out of.\n“This Conservative Government must now do the decent thing and delay next week’s expansion until Universal Credit systems are working properly. If they don’t, then hundreds of thousands more families each month will have to suffer weeks with no money, causing them long-term financial problems.\n“How is it fair that so many families will be made to suffer simply because the government will not admit they still can’t get Universal Credit working properly.”\nThe letter also points out that less than 40% of claimants register successfully with the government’s compulsory online portal, and that the phone ‘helpline’ is simply an automatic message, directing claimants to the website, so they can’t find out what is happening with their claim.\nCitizens Advice has already called on the government to delay the programme in light of the evidence from the people they help, of whom over half had to borrow money whilst waiting for their first Universal Credit payment.\nCouncils and Landlords’ organisations have also called for the roll-out to be delayed as over half of recipients of Universal Credit are in rent arrears. Many tenants are in danger of eviction and some landlords now refuse tenants who are on Universal Credit, making housing problems worse.",

Labour’s analysis found that:\n- Schools in Yorkshire and Humber region are set to be £38,723,155 worse off in total, more than the average cut of £37 million.\n- Schools in Hull town/city are set to be £1,964,321 worse off in total\n- Schools across East Riding of Yorkshire local authority area are set to be worse off by £2,173,492 in total\nLabour said the latest gaffe at the Department for Education will cause yet more pain for schools already struggling to balance budgets after years of uncertainty over long-term funding and threatened to further weaken the relationship between local schools and families.\nThe Party said that trust in the schools system was already at breaking point due to the days of learning missed by children in recent years.\nLabour pointed to the decisions taken by the Conservatives to open pubs before schools during covid, to prolong strike action by refusing to negotiate with trade unions and to cut funding for school rebuilding, leading to the dangerous RAAC concrete crisis which has affected hundreds of schools, causing many to shut their doors.\nShortly after revealing the error, Conservative Education Secretary Gillian Keegan raised eyebrows by claiming that her Party’s stunning by-election defeats in Mid Bedfordshire and Tamworth “did not show a swing to Labour”. The swing to Labour in Tamworth was 23.9 per cent, while the swing to Labour in Mid Bedfordshire was 20.5 per cent.\nBridget Phillipson MP, Labour’s Shadow Education Secretary, said:\n“Rishi Sunak wants young people to learn maths to 18, but he ought to get his own house in order first and teach Conservative Education Ministers how to count.\n“Ministers’ staggering mathematical incompetence follows hot on the heels of disruption caused by the Conservatives which has pushed our schools to breaking point.\n“It’s no wonder that the relationship between families, schools and government is at rock bottom – education simply isn’t a priority for the Conservatives.\n“Labour’s priority will be to put education at the heart of national life again, and to rebuild the trust between schools, families and government so that we can drive high and rising standards in our classrooms, supporting children to achieve and thrive.\n“We will start by recruiting 6,500 more teachers and put mental health counsellors in every secondary school, paid for by ending private schools’ tax breaks.”\n| Region | Total Cuts (-) |\n| East Mids | £33,472,873 |\n| East of England | £44,145,053 |\n| Inner London | £8,363,169 |\n| Outer London | £35,715,483 |\n| North East | £18,512,167 |\n| North West | £53,348,157 |\n| South East | £61,715,181 |\n| South West | £36,028,775 |\n| West Mids | £42,599,135 |\n| Yorkshire and Humber | £38,723,155 |",
