If the polls are to be believed, that will be a Labour government with a 140+ seat majority. With this in mind, it’s important that we have strong and principled voices that will hold the next Government to account over the important issues that matter to ordinary people. The Green Party has an unbroken record of standing up for what matters, and being the adults in the room. Greens across the country are already representing their communities and working honestly and collaboratively for the common good. There’s no reason why we can’t have a group of principled people in Parliament fighting for these values too.\nI’m standing as a three-time candidate in this election. Cheekily, I suspect I can credibly argue that I am the most experienced candidate in this race.\nSouthend East & Rochford has faced years of neglect at the hands of an MP more interested in his own political career than championing our community. I want to give the good people of this area the real option to choose a fairer and greener future for their families. No doubt the Conservatives will end up parachuting in a last-minute candidate who has no ties to Southend, and what a shame that would be for our City. I have lived and worked in this area for many years and I’m proud to call it my home. I have stood up for the most impoverished parts of this area, and I have fought on behalf of residents who are struggling to make ends meet. I have stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Doctors and Nurses in the fight to save our Hospital from cuts, and I have battled against developers who seek to destroy what little green belt land we have left. This is my record, and I pledge to take this fighting spirit to Westminster where I would be honoured to be our representative.”Simon Cross\nLatest News\n- Big Summer SocialJoin the Southend Green Party for our Big Summer Social!\n- Green Councillors stand up against the proposed Bournes Green DevelopmentAt Wednesday’s Extraordinary Full Council Meeting, the Green Group on Southend City Council made their position unmistakably clear regarding a motion brought to Council.

I’ve been out campaigning today with Richard Longstaff on the doorsteps getting the experience, and it’s great to see the hard work that Richard and his team have put in for the residents of Leigh. The Green Party have got ideas of the future, and we’re proud of doing things differently. There are now Greens in Council chambers up and down the country at every level, and there are 16 councils around the country where Greens are already part of the administration. Voters know that there are Greens working hard for their community and making a difference everywhere.\nCllr Nate Higgins said:\nIt’s really exciting to be here today to be part of this campaign. This year is one of the most important elections in the history of the Green Party. The council seat that I hold in Newham in London proves that there’s nowhere the Greens can’t win. People told me on the doorsteps today that they know Richard and they’ll be voting for him. We know from experience that having a Green in the room does make a difference, and I can’t wait to see Richard and other local Greens on Southend Council.\nLocal Green Party Branch Coordinator James Vessey-Miller said:\nResidents have told us that they’re tired of inaction on many local issues, and many voters are now switching to the Green Party because they’ve seen our track record of hard work from our local candidates. In every area across Southend, the Green Party is a credible choice in these elections. Many areas across Essex already have elected Greens on councils, and I look forward to getting our hard-working candidates elected here too.",
  "https_southeastessex_greenparty_org_uk_/https_southeastessex_greenparty_org_uk_news_2022_04_10_greens-launch-bus-petition/content_116.html": "Full article below the petition:\nBus users are already contributing to building a cleaner city. By taking the bus, you’re helping solve congestion and air pollution and help reduce the city’s environmental impact. Thank you!\nBut Southend Council has consistently failed bus users across the city. For decades we’ve seen fares getting more expensive, vital routes being slashed, and services becoming more infrequent.\nIf we’re to fix our problems with Air Pollution and meet our climate goals as a city, we urgently need dependable, accessible, and affordable public transport for everyone. That means having an integrated public transit system that makes walking, cycling, and public transit the cleanest, most affordable, and most convenient options across the city.\nThat starts by having a council that actually cares about buses, cycling, and walking.Do you agree? Join our campaign to pressure the council to make public transport in Southend better.\nPlease sign and share this petition.\nThe full story:\nBuses in Southend are a crucial means of transport for local people. For many car-free households, our local bus services are the primary way that people commute to work and school, and it’s how they make important trips to GPs and other local services and amenities.\nIn 2021 alone, buses in Southend travelled a combined 2.6 million miles across our roads, providing an invaluable connection for communities across the city. This connectivity helps the local economy thrive, and contributes to the independence, happiness, and well-being of our residents.\nBuses also play an important role in helping reduce the city’s air pollution and carbon emissions. Estimates from the Department for Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) show that vehicles on our roads are responsible for a significant proportion of local carbon emissions, accounting for 29% of all estimated local emissions in 2019. Buses help reduce the overall number of vehicles on our roads and are a far more efficient means of mass transportation in both space and emissions than private car use.\nCurrently, a majority of the city’s regular bus users are those from the BAME communities and the city’s lowest-income families. Bus users making use of the National Concessionary Bus Pass accounted for around 40% of local bus trips in 2018/19. Town centre wards such as Kursaal, Victoria, and Westborough have the highest number of bus users compared with other wards; with Thorpe, Chalkwell, and both Leigh wards having the lowest average.\nWhat’s been happening with the buses?\nThe city’s bus network clocked up 9.7 million trips in 2009/10, but that number has slowly declined to just 7.1 million in 2019/20.\nAs the city wrangles with areas of illegally-poor Air Quality and chronic congestion, the council should be promoting and prioritising bus use for our residents. Instead, poor planning and progressive declines in standards of service have resulted in a reduction in the number of regular bus users.\nThe council’s own documents state: “Bus services in the town are not fulfilling their potential.”\nSouthend has four private Bus companies operating twenty routes across the city. These companies flood the four main transit corridors with regular profitable services, whilst communities in Leigh, Shoeburyness, and Eastwood are largely disconnected from the network; only receiving infrequent and often meaningless connections.\nPre-pandemic data showed that 40% of services across the network (over 14,800 timing points) were over five minutes late. Users have also noted a worsening reduction in the frequency of services, whilst also bearing the full weight of higher and higher annual fare increases.\nBus use in the city is also low compared with other cities. York has a comparable population to Southend, yet achieved 4.4 million bus miles in 2021.\nAnalysis by Mott MacDonald shows walking distance to the nearest bus stops in Southend.\nThe connectivity of the network is also poor, with services often only operating via the town centre as an interchange. For example, there is currently no direct service from Eastwood to Leigh. To make that simple journey via bus would take you three times as long, necessitating a change in the Town centre.\nIt is obvious to us that the city’s bus services are broken, and are being run purely for profit and not for those who depend on them.\nAs the climate emergency necessitates changes to our way of life, buses will be a vital tool in tackling our own carbon emissions. We think that all of the city’s buses should provide a useful and interconnected service and that they should be reliable, accessible, and affordable to every resident.\nWhat can we do to fix it?\nThe Green Party have launched the above petition, calling on Southend Council to work with the bus operators to improve the dependability, accessibility, and affordability of bus services across Southend.\nPlease sign and share this petition.\nThe Greens are also proud to pledge that we will;\n- Develop a new and ambitious Integrated Transport Plan, increasing the provision, reliability and affordability of Public Transport services;\n- Seek to work with existing local bus companies, reforming the Local Authority’s Bus Working Group and Quality Bus Partnerships, and working to yield a significant improvement in the frequency, accessibility, the number of routes, and overall reliability of bus infrastructure across the borough;\n- Seek to introduce new night bus services across the borough, and improve the frequency and reliability of weekend bus services;\nView Manifesto.\nSources & Further Reading:\nDfT Public Service Vehicle Survey 2021\nSouthend Council Bus Service Improvement Plan, October 2021.\nhttps://www.echo-news.co.uk/news/20058151.firstbus-make-changes-south-essex-services/",

However, the banks will not lend money for such schemes without sovereign loan guarantees, meaning if it all goes wrong it is the taxpayer that foots the bill.\nThe government has already signed the taxpayer up to £17B; however, if and when Hinckley C goes ahead, EDF may not have the resources to fund others.\nEDF is currently selling assets to raise finances as all of the 58 French-based reactors are reaching the end of their expected shelf-life and EDF are facing a £100B bill to extend the operation of those facilities.\nThe technology is supplied by AREVA, a company in so much financial trouble it had to be rescued by the French government.\nAreva has a poor safety record, and out of the four reactors currently under construction, three are faulty and may have to be abandoned.\nAreva has also been found to falsifying quality control records for up to 50 years at three separate factories.\nThe Chinese involvement with British energy infrastructure also raises concerns as to-date, China has only exported small-scale projects in countries such as Pakistan.\nThe state-owned Chinese companies have safety and quality standards well short of the UK and far below EU standards, potentially threatening the quality of any facilities.\nThe UK carries out long-period safety studies on proposed developments which usually take 5-10 years.\nThere is not the opportunity to conduct such a review on the proposed Chinese reactors at present, as it has not been yet decided which experimental reactor they will supply us with.\nA new Nuclear power station would not provide long-term employment as advertised, but instead only short-term jobs.\nPermanent jobs operating at the site are likely to involve bussing in specialist workers from outside the area.\nIS BRADWELL A THREAT TO SOUTHEND?\nOn 21 October 2015, it was reported that Britain and China have reached Strategic Investment Agreements for three nuclear power plants, including one at Bradwell.\nBradwell has been chosen as it is an existing site under nuclear friendly ownership (EDF) and has alleged public support to build a new experimental Chinese-designed Hualong One reactor.\nIf the new power station is built, all spent fuel would also be stored on-site.\nWhile many in Southend might not be concerned about Bradwell and it’s potential implications, in reality, it is just 15 miles from Southend.\nWhile that might sound adequate not to fret, in perspective, the exclusion zone around Chernobyl was 18 miles.\nThat puts lots of people in Southend and East Essex in immediate danger should an accident occur.\nThe Bradwell site is unsuitable for the construction of a new Nuclear Reactor.\nThe location on the Estuary of the Blackwater, which is a low lying shallow estuary with a slow refresh rate (10 days), means it is vulnerable to storm surges, coastal processes, sea level changes, and climate change implications.\nFor a new larger power station, large volumes of water would be required for the cooling process and the Blackwater would not be able to meet this supply.\nIt also has been ignored that the Blackwater is a Marine Protection Zone. and the government has said that ‘it is not possible to rule out the adverse impact on the environment’ justifying this by saying it is acceptable if in the public interest to harm the environment.\nThere are many myths attached to the nuclear power industry, one of the biggest beings that Nuclear is clean energy.\nNuclear Power is not carbon emission free.\nThe whole ‘nuclear cycle’, from uranium mining onwards, produces more greenhouse gases than most renewable energy sources with up to 50% more atmospheric emissions than wind power.\nAnother myth is sustainability.\nNuclear Power is not sustainable.\nThe reserves of uranium ores used to generate nuclear power are going to run out.\nThere is only at-best, fifty years worth of high-concentrate uranium ore left in the world. There may be only 200 years left of all uranium ore available. This mainly low-grade uranium ore takes more energy to mine and process – thus releasing more carbon emissions.\nTruths? there are plenty:\nNuclear power threatens the environment and people’s health. It produces enormous amounts of carcinogenic toxic radioactive waste, some of which is dangerous for thousands of years.\nNo safe practical solution has yet been devised to store nuclear waste.\nIn particular, there is evidence of cancer clusters linked to nuclear power production. Building new nuclear power stations would increase the most toxic high-level waste five-fold.\nRead CND’s summary of the German government-commissioned research that shows increases in Cancer in children under five living near nuclear power stations.\n- Uranium Mining Kills.\nUranium mining is the first step in the nuclear power cycle; it has taken the lives of many miners all over the world causing environmental contamination, cancers and producing nuclear waste. - Nuclear Accidents.\nThe risk of terrible nuclear accidents like Chernobyl, Three Mile Island, Windscale (Sellafield), Fukushima, and now Hanford will have lasting effects on the surrounding environment and its inhabitants. - A Terrorist Target.\nNuclear power carries with it the great risk of nuclear terrorism.\nIn this age of uncertainty; “Dirty Bombs” and attacks on power stations are a viable and very real threat. - The proliferation of Nuclear Weapons is inextricably linked to nuclear power by a shared need for enriched uranium, and through the generation of plutonium as a by-product of spent nuclear fuel.\nThe two industries have been linked since the very beginning and a nuclear weapons-free world requires a non-nuclear energy policy.\nNuclear power comes with the added problem of disposing of Nuclear Waste. Nobody knows the true costs of waste management such to the extent where costs are so high that nuclear power can never be economically viable. Plutonium is the most dangerous material in the world.\nThe nuclear industry still has no solution to the problem of Nuclear Waste.\nThe transportation of this waste poses an unacceptable risk to people and the environment.\nThe waste –spent fuel– is dangerously radioactive, and remains so for thousands of years. When it first comes out of the reactor, it is so toxic that if you stood within a few meters of it while it was unshielded, you would receive a lethal radioactive dose within a few seconds and would die of acute radiation sickness within a few days.\nSellafield is home to 80% of the UK’s nuclear waste and some of the world’s most hazardous buildings.\nThis was where, in the early 1950s, the Windscale facility produced the Plutonium-239 that would be used in the UK’s first nuclear weapon.\nAs the radioactive material is difficult to dispose of, it is common practice to bury it under the ground.\nHowever, there are serious implications of this act of burial. All radioactive material can cause harm as it decays. Storage of nuclear waste conveys a range of serious risks that are often swept under the carpet such as a potential terrorist threat to the large volumes of radioactive wastes currently being stored and the risk that this waste could leak or be dispersed as a result of terrorist action.\nThere are safer, more cost-effective energy solutions; currently, we are capable of producing in excess of what Hinckley C would produce from renewables.\nThe costs of nuclear power are known to be rising while the costs of renewables are falling; it was asked why they are the government still pushing ahead with the schemes? The consensus is that no one wants to lose face and back down as this would cause embarrassment for the government and or the partner companies. There is also the by-product of the Nuclear Power industry – Nuclear warheads – burnt-up Uranium produces Plutonium – the Plutonium from Bradwell when it was operational was used in Nuclear Warheads. While we have Trident, money will be put into Nuclear Power even if it is not the safest and most economical source.\nNuclear wastes are hazardous for tens of thousands of years. It is clearly is unprecedented to leave behind this legacy as a threat to future generations.\nThe South East Essex Green Party recently attended the Remember Fukushima March on Parliament & Rally commemorating the 7-year anniversary of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Disaster.\nFukushima, a ‘Level 7′ event on the International Nuclear Event Scale, was the most significant Nuclear incident since Chernobyl. The six American-built (GE) reactors were maintained by the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), and following the Tōhoku earthquake, resulted in a devastating meltdown that the Japanese are still dealing with.\nThe disaster displaced 50,000 households in a 20km exclusion zone, and a subsequent 2013 WHO report predicts that for populations living in the most affected areas there is a 70% higher risk of developing thyroid cancer for girls exposed as infants, a 7% higher risk of leukemia in males exposed as infants, a 6% higher risk of breast cancer in females exposed as infants and a 4% higher risk, overall, of developing solid cancers for females.\nOn 24 May 2012, more than a year after the disaster, TEPCO released their estimate of radioactivity releases due to the Disaster:\n- An estimated 538,100 terabecquerels (TBq) of iodine-131, caesium-134 and caesium-137 were released.\n- 520,000 TBq was released into the atmosphere between 12 and 31 March 2011.\n- 18,100 TBq into the ocean from 26 March to 30 September 2011.\n- A total of 511,000 TBq of iodine-131 was released into both the atmosphere and the ocean.\nThis disaster, at an American-Built facility, proves that Nuclear Power still cannot be considered safe.\nAt the March, the security of the UK’s proposed coast-based facilities was called into question.\nDoes it make any sense to have 40% of all UK power generation at only eight sites?\nWould this not result in these sites becoming even more of a potential terrorist threat?\nCompare this to alternative renewable energy sources such as Wind and Solar generation, which is dispersed and decentralised across the country, and is less susceptible to a terrorist attack or natural disaster.\nHolding Southend Council to Account:\nThe dangers that South Essex residents would be subjected to in the event of a Nuclear incident at Bradwell would be catastrophic.\nRecently our Treasurer, Clare Fletcher, took the opportunity to ask public questions at the Southend Borough Council Full Council Meeting 22/01/2018 regarding the prospect of a new nuclear power station at Bradwell.\nThe questions asked and the answers provided were:\n- As a consequence of the recent planning application to carry out preliminary ground investigations and associated works approved by Maldon District Council, the prospect of a new nuclear power station at Bradwell is becoming more of reality; what involvement has Southend Borough Council had in the discussions regarding this Development?\nAnswer: None. - Given that the exclusion zone extended 18 miles away from Chernobyl and that the centre of Southend is approximately 15 miles from Bradwell, what provisions does Southend Council plan to put in place to evacuate residents in the case of a nuclear disaster at the site?\nAnswer:\nAfter the decommissioning of the previous reactor at the site, Southend Borough Council does not currently consider Bradwell Power Station to be a current threat.\nThey also added that the implementation of safer reactors in the new site would mean that Bradwell would be less of a threat to the Borough than previously.\nWhile these answers are not a surprise to the South East Essex Green Party, it is disheartening that the local council are not looking at issues from the wider area that have the potential of having serious impacts on future generations in the borough.\nThe local party would like the councillors to be less short-sighted, more forward thinking and looking at developments beyond their current term of office.\nWith thanks to Prof. Stephen Thomas, Professor of Energy Policy, PSIRU Associate of the University of Greenwich for providing the key information contained in this document.\nFurther Reading:\nBBC: Nuclear power: Eight sites identified for future plants.",

The Green Party stands firm on a platform of social and environmental justice, and our three Green MEPs have already worked with their Green counterparts in Europe to ensure some of the societal and environmental protections that we all benefit from.\nDue to the Proportional Representation electoral system used in EU elections, tactical voting is ineffective and unwise. The Greens came within 1% of winning a seat in the East last time, beating the Lib Dems.\nGreens are the leading pro-EU party in the East.\nThe Green Party has announced that its lead candidate for Eastern Region in the May European elections is Dr Catherine Rowett, a Norwich resident and Professor of Philosophy at the University of East Anglia. If elected she will represent Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex, Cambridgeshire, Bedfordshire, and Hertfordshire in the European Parliament.\nThe Green Party is the East of England’s leading Remain Party, while in the European Parliament the Green Party is the UK’s biggest pro-EU party. The lead Eastern region candidate, Dr Catherine Rowett, is committed to making this a fairer country inside the European Union and says:\n“By voting Green you will send a clear message that you want the UK to Remain in the European Union. Green MEPs make a positive difference: for urgent action on the climate emergency and a fairer economy. Vote for a positive future on 23rd May – vote Green.”\nCatherine is a long-term Green Party activist and was the Green Party Parliamentary candidate for South Norfolk in 2015 and 2017. She is a keen supporter of collaboration across borders.\nIf elected to the European Parliament, Catherine looks forward to working with UK Green MEPs, and with Green parties across Europe, to develop EU policies on agriculture, fisheries, taxation, aviation and energy that will tackle the global climate emergency, the rise of nationalism, and its underlying causes, such as inequality.\nThis time around, the Greens’ chances are even better, as the dithering by the two major parties over Brexit has fractured their vote while fears over the climate crisis have risen far higher in people’s thoughts.\nAs Green MP Caroline Lucas has pointed out:\n“Greens came close in Eastern England last time. We are the region’s strongest pro-Remain party. You can elect a Green MEP for the East this time.”",

The skip company, which already has a waste processing facility on the Burnt Mills Industrial Estate in Basildon, currently handles a quarter of a million tonnes of waste annually.\nNamed the Archers Fields Energy Recovery Facility (ERF), this new plant would require up to three 25-tonne HGV deliveries of waste every hour, 24/7 to feed the furnaces, and the company hopes that the facility will generate electricity for 20,000 homes.\nThis news comes less than a year after Essex County Council dramatically took Urbaser Balfour Beatty, (the owners of the nearby Tovi Eco Park Waste-to-Energy facility) to court over “obfuscation and half-truths” regarding a fatal design flaw in the plant’s treatment process, which meant that hundreds of thousands of tonnes of waste were still being sent to landfill.\nGlossy promotional materials boasting the eco-credentials of the proposed Archers Fields site have since been sent to 4000 neighbouring homes and businesses.\nWaste-to-Energy Facilities are not ‘clean energy’.\nIncineration has had somewhat of a PR makeover over the last few years.\nProposals for these kinds of WTE schemes have been cropping up all over the country in the last few years with bold claims that it will jointly reduce waste being sent to landfill whilst generating ‘clean energy’ for neighbouring homes and businesses.\nThe truth is that whilst schemes like this claim to be environmentally-conscious, in operation they almost never are.\nCarcinogenic Dioxins\nWe’ve known since the 80’s that hormone-altering and cancer-causing Dioxins (chlorinated organic molecules) are generated from the burning of waste in these processes, specifically forming when flue gases from this kind of refuse incineration cool down. These chemicals are part of the “dirty dozen” – a group of dangerous chemicals known as persistent organic pollutants which can cause serious harm to humans and the environment.\nPolychlorinated Dibenzodioxins (PCDDs), Polychlorinated Dibenzofurans (PCDFs), and Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) are all extremely harmful to health, and long-term exposure is linked to impairment of the immune system, the developing nervous system, the endocrine system, and reproductive functions. All of these chemicals can be generated as a result of burning waste.\nAs a result waste incinerator operators have had to retrofit their plants with systems intended at limiting the number of these dioxins that escape via the flue gases. In recent years, some schemes have gone as far as to suggest that their exhaust cleaning systems are perfectly clean, and their incinerators are of no immediate threat to the health of neighbouring towns.\nBut recent research has proven that systems installed to clean the dangerous flue gas, can actually inadvertently create the ideal conditions for these incredibly dangerous molecules to form and escape into the air whilst also condensing into the fly ash. This means that despite the plant having preventative systems in place, some of the most dangerous airborne compounds will likely be created as a result of this plant’s operation.\nGiven that the plant is within short range of Whitmore Primary School, Frypa Hall School, Northlands Park Nursery, Felmore Primary School, Briscoe Primary School & Nursery, and Northlands Park, and the site is adjacent to the clean air zone identified by Essex County Council and Basildon Council; we’d suggest that perhaps greater scrutiny be given to the kinds of airborne pollutants this plant could be exposing our children to.\nAdditionally, whilst the promotional graphic illustrated by the company seems to infer that the plant will generate “no landfill” and “no export”, the high dioxin concentration fly ash generated from the plant is indeed waste; waste of the most dangerous kind. Waste that would likely go to a hazardous waste landfill.\nThe Climate Emergency & Air Pollution\nAnother stake through the heart of the false ‘Green Energy’ narrative of these schemes is the enormous amounts of CO2 emissions WTE plants generate in operation.\nAn average figure is something in the realm of 7-14 kg CO2 per tonne of waste, and if this plant plans to process 150,000 tonnes of waste each year, it has the potential to generate a staggering 2.1 Million kgs of emitted CO2 every year.\nNot exactly green or clean and exactly the sorts of schemes we need to be stopping if we want to tackle the climate emergency.\nAdditionally, obtaining low emissions values for Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) requires the use of more electricity in the process, while attaining low emissions of Nitrous Oxides (NOx) usually requires an additional supply of gas. Electricity is not only generated but also consumed in the operation of a WTE plant, in a particular for cranes, fans and air pollution control. It may also be used for flue gas condensation.\nThis is also before we even start to calculate the carbon footprint and air pollution impact of the 72 HGV trips each day required to feed the site.\nAt this time of Climate Emergency, it has never been more important to forensically consider the CO2 Pollution and Air Quality impacts of schemes like this.\nPeddling these schemes as ‘green’ and ‘clean’ is misleading, and dangerous.\nA Green alternative to Incineration\nBurning any waste should always be the last resort for any modern municipal waste systems.\nThe Green Party has long campaigned against the incineration of waste citing air pollution and carbon emissions concerns, and these WTE facilities are just dressed-up incinerators.\nGreen Party policy is staunchly against the incineration of waste\n[Green Party Policy: NR416 (VIII)]\n… and instead calls for a radical overhaul of the way we obtain and use materials and the way we deal with subsequent waste.\nThe Greens campaign to bring in A Waste Avoidance and Recycling Act, and the creation of A Standards Commission whose joint efforts will be to adopt circular economic principles, reshifting production from the exploitative linear economic model, to that of a new infinitely sustainable model.\nIf we are to tackle the linked crises of Climate Change and Air Pollution, we should be working against these kinds of polluting industries, and instead, supporting businesses to adopt more sustainable practices.\nSarah Read, your Green Party Candidate for Billericay East said;\n“As a local resident, I am very concerned about the increase in air pollution and carbon emissions linked to this proposed WTE plant.\nAs a mother, I am also deeply worried about the health risks related to the release of carcinogenic dioxins into an area close to many local schools.\nLong term exposure to these pollutants is linked to the impairment of the immune system, and as our community recovers from the COVID-19 virus I’m sure we all want to keep our immune systems as strong as possible.”\n– Sarah Read, Billericay Basildon & Wickford Green Party\nClearaway Ltd is looking to hear the views of residents, and an open consultation available on their website is open until June 12th 2020.\nWe strongly advise that residents investigate the huge environmental impact such a plant has, and to respond accordingly.\nWe encourage residents and Green Party members to participate in the company’s consultation.\nhttps://archersfields-erf.co.uk/\nAdditionally, please consider signing up to the Green Party’s free mailing list, to be kept up to date with the latest news from your local branch.\nFurther Reading:\nhttps://www.essexlive.news/news/local-news/plans-revealed-50m-energy-plant-4154088\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-essex-48151665\nhttps://phys.org/news/2014-09-unforeseen-dioxin-formation-incineration.html\nhttps://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dioxins-and-their-effects-on-human-health\nhttps://waste-management-world.com/a/waste-to-energy-the-carbon-perspective\nGreen Party Policy on Natural Resources:\nhttps://policy.greenparty.org.uk/nr.html",

Traffic congestion along the A127 and A130, in addition to the pollution from the Airport only compounds these issues. Rather than kicking the can along the road by conducting long-term studies as the Conservatives are doing, Greens would introduce radical measures to help alleviate the town’s congestion crisis, and would bring in new controls to ensure clean, breathable air for our town.\nClean Air is a right, and our current administration is failing us.\nLitter is at epidemic levels across the town; Marine pollution is at such the extent whereby voluntary groups in Southend (including some set up by the Green Party) are out almost every weekend collecting the discarded trash that sullies our wonderful beaches and coastline. Greens would continue to tackle rampant littering and fly-tipping and would seek to support voluntary groups in a community effort to tidy up our town. Other initiatives such as repair cafes, and upcycling groups would also be given funding to help repair and repurpose broken goods and electronics to reduce the amount of waste going to landfill.\nSmall local businesses and our High Street are struggling. Whilst the Labour party believes the future of our High Street is residential, the Greens stand by our commitment to local business and believe that in order to save our High Street, we should be blockading any out-of-town retail parks that would seal the fate of our ailing high-street. Small cooperatives and businesses should be supported with concessions to business rates, and a full-time indoor fresh food market introduced to support local growers and help promote healthy eating.\nHousing is at crisis-level in our town. More families are struggling to make ends meet, and many families are in destitution paying ever-increasing rent amounts each month. The Conservatives and Labour are lauding the Better Queensway scheme as one answer to our town’s issues, but in reality there will be no-truly affordable homes on the site for local people. We believe a sustainable and affordable housing revolution in our town is required. We need to stop building luxury commuter homes on Green-belt land, and should be building truly-affordable homes on the 50+ brownfield sites across our town, and supporting new housing co-operatives that will make it happen.\nOur full Manifesto is published in the Our Manifesto section:\nNationally, the Green Party is continually growing and there are more Green Party representatives on Councils across the country than ever before. The South East Essex branch is the fastest-growing political party in the town, growing 30% year-on-year.\nWe have already delivered amazing results across the town, from stopping the monstrously expensive cliffslip museum, to working for residents in identifying and solving litter hotspots. We are already gaining a lot of support from people across the town who have told us that they’ll be voting Green this year; they really appreciate the honesty and hard work of our dedicated local volunteers.

Building over what should be productive agricultural land and precious green spaces is not the answer. There are over one million empty homes across the country and another million plots with planning permission already granted. We should be putting that land and those homes to use first.”\nThe Party is calling for housing developments to prioritise brownfield sites close to existing public transport links, and to be planned alongside vital services such as shops, cafés, doctors’ surgeries and schools – rather than simply sprawling into open countryside without adequate provisions.\nBournes Green, the Greens argue, offers far more value to the community and future generations as protected agricultural land and open space, particularly as climate change threatens food security.\n“Local food production will become increasingly critical. Concreting over land like Bournes Green undermines our ability to feed ourselves in the future,” Cllr Stuart Allen added.\nThe Green Party is urging Southend residents to oppose the proposals and support a smarter, more sustainable approach to housing and community planning.\n– ENDS –\nBournes Green in Southend-on-Sea is classified as Grade 2 agricultural land, indicating it is of very good quality and suitable for a wide range of crops. This classification is based on a detailed Agricultural Land Classification (ALC) survey conducted by Natural England, which assessed approximately 78.3 hectares of land at Bournes Green. The survey found that the area is predominantly in arable agricultural use, with the majority of the land under winter cereals at the time of assessment.",

Data ©ZapMap:As part of his questioning, James criticised the council for its failure to maintain the few existing council-owned EV charging locations, and for its complete lack of ambition in planning new sites. At the moment, just ten public sites for EV charging exist in Southend, facilitating just 22 electric vehicles charging at any one time. This is simply insufficient given the ever-increasing rate of EV ownership in Southend.\nHe went on to warn the council that if they fail to plan for the anticipated widespread electric vehicle transition, then residential neighbourhoods across Southend could become littered with cables put out across pavements by residents with no off-street parking needing to charge their vehicles; a serious risk to those with restricted mobility, the elderly, and disabled people.\nIn the council’s official response, Cllr Carole Mulroney (Liberal Democrat) cited “technical challenges” and Southend’s “disparate substation network” as a core reason why the council wasn’t installing new EV charging locations at the same rate as other UK cities are.\nNew research collated and published by the Green Party today shows that this is demonstrably false, with UK Power Networks confirming that every single secondary 11kV substation in Southend is capable of supplying one or multiple rapid DC electric vehicle charging units. UKPN also confirm that the grid can handle tens of thousands of new ‘slow chargers’ installed without any detrimental impact (or need for significant modifications) to the electricity connection across Southend.\nIn a video published by Mr Vessey-Miller today, he is quoted saying:\n- “We now know that any Councillor who says that the “grid can’t handle it” is either lying because they don’t want EV chargers, or they simply don’t know what they’re talking about.\n- “To help Southend Council make a more informed decision, I have collated all of this data from UK Power Networks and have given it to the Portfolio Holder and Southend Council for them to have a read-over. From now on out, if the Council say no to new EV chargers on the kerbside, they can’t claim that it’s because of the limitations of the grid connection.\n- “EV’s aren’t the silver bullet – I want public transport so accessible, dependable, and affordable that it’s easier and cheaper to use buses and trains to get around than using cars. But I also recognise that failing to acknowledge that many people will transition to EV ownership, and as such, not thinking about how these people will charge their EVs would be a costly mistake.”\nThe Green Party have provided the Council with all of the data collated, and we await their formal response.\nYou can see the interactive map from UK Power Networks here:\nhttps://dgmap.ukpowernetworks.co.uk/site/?q=ev_ext",

The Green Party is on course to significantly increase its number of elected MPs in this General Election, and local champions Tilly and Simon hope to continue the success of the Greens in this year’s city council elections in May.\nThe Greens’ General Election Manifesto, which will be published in the coming days, is set to make key pledges on the protection of nature, bringing utility companies into public ownership, and creating sustainable and quality homes in the right place at the right price. Green Party Co-Leaders Carla Denyer and Adrian Ramsay are on track to become new Green MPs in Bristol Central and Waveney Valley respectively.\nTilly Hogrebe, Green Party General Election candidate for Southend West & Leigh said;\n“I’m pleased that the long-awaited General Election has finally been called, after months of speculation. Voters in Southend will be given the opportunity to choose a new direction for our community, our city, and our country. Southend residents can see how the Conservatives take their vote for granted here, and they don’t feel any better off after fourteen years of Conservative government. The offer from Starmer’s Labour is particularly uninspiring too, and they are yet to even announce their candidate in this election. Does Labour even want people’s votes here?\n“Voters know what the Green Party stands for. Every vote for the Green Party in this election sends a strong message to the next Labour government that people want forward-thinking and innovative action on the crises our country faces. The Greens have a transformative and hopeful vision of what our country can be; a fairer and greener society, where people have financial and energy security, where people can lead happier and healthier lives in a good quality and affordable home, and where the reality of the climate emergency is given the urgent attention it needs.\n“I would urge Southend residents; if you share our values, join the Green Party, help our campaign, and we can make the case for a more compassionate and sustainable Southend. Together, we can make our voice heard.”\nSimon Cross, Green Party General Election candidate for Southend East & Rochford said;\n“In just over 40 days time, we will have a new Government. If the polls are to be believed, that will be a Labour government with a 140+ seat majority. With this in mind, it’s important that we have strong and principled voices that will hold the next Government to account over the important issues that matter to ordinary people. The Green Party has an unbroken record of standing up for what matters, and being the adults in the room. Greens across the country are already representing their communities and working honestly and collaboratively for the common good. There’s no reason why we can’t have a group of principled people in Parliament fighting for these values too.\n“I’m standing as a three-time candidate in this election. Cheekily, I suspect I can credibly argue that I am the most experienced candidate in this race. No doubt the Conservatives will end up parachuting in a last-minute candidate who has no ties to Southend, and what a shame that would be for our City. I have lived and worked in this area for many years and I’m proud to call it my home. I have stood up for the most impoverished parts of this area, and I have fought on behalf of residents who are struggling to make ends meet. I have stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Doctors and Nurses in the fight to save our Hospital from cuts, and I have battled against developers who seek to destroy what little green belt land we have left. This is my record, and I pledge to take this fighting spirit to Westminster where I would be honoured to be our representative.”\nENDS",

The government’s approach in continuing to slam the door in the face of people in desperate need brings shame on our country.\nThe Green Party’s national Migration and Refugee Support Spokesperson, Benali Hamdache:\n“Priti Patel is making our country look cruel and incompetent in the face of the humanitarian disaster. But Labour’s failure to back visa-free access is even more shocking. The need to waive visas has never been more pressing.\nMy family fled oppression and conflict during the Algerian War of Independence. It’s heartbreaking to see refugees treated like political footballs and infuriating to see our Home Secretary get away with it.\nBut what is even more alarming is that the Home Secretary is using her position to distort the discussion about refugees, while also being on the verge of delivering the biggest change to our asylum process in decades.“\nLocal Green Party member Jon Fuller:\n“Like everyone else we were horrified by the images coming out of Ukraine but felt our government’s response was beyond callous. So we decided to organise a demonstration outside the local MPs office this evening. Steph made a homemade banner with the message ‘Admit the refugees NOW’ and we suggested people bring a simple placard with the word ‘Now’ on it. We had a great turnout.\nI thought it was important to hear from a local refugee, Stanford, who spoke about his experience and the plight of all refugees. Then the magnificent Tim Sneller set the wider agenda. I said a couple of words at the outset.\nI have emailed my MP, Anna Firth. I focussed upon the appalling failure by our government, mentioning crisps, KitKat bars and visas. I condemned the Home Secretary for the chaos and also took the opportunity to condemn the Foreign Secretary for lying about the suggestion some Brits might travel to Ukraine to fight. The national security implications are enormous – at times like this it is absolutely crucial that Ministers behave with honesty and integrity so that an adversary knows whether our words can or cannot be trusted.”\nThe local branch Coordinator, James Vessey-Miller:\n“I was pleased to have helped organise this impromptu protest in aid of the Ukrainian Refugees outside the office of our new Conservative MP Anna Firth this evening.\nThe government expecting innocent refugees fleeing war to be capable of applying for visas from temporary camps across Europe is scandalous, and again highlights that the Tories’ hostile environment policy is alive and kicking.\nEurope is rightly welcoming and offering safe sanctuary to these people, and it is shameful that we continue to slam the door in the face of fellow Europeans in their hour of desperate need.\nMy friend Tim mentioned at tonight’s demo that it is utterly outrageous that the Tories continue to politicise the border, and that much of their messaging about this situation continues their much recited ‘build the wall’ Brexit war-cries. It is horrendous that Priti Patel (who is herself a descendant of immigrants) continues to turn away desperate people to placate the Conservative-voting demographic. Shame.\nI was proud also to bring along the EU flag this evening. What we need at this moment, in my opinion, is united European solidarity in aid of the Ukrainian people. This flag still represents those of us that hold the cooperative spirit of an undivided continent in our hearts. I hope dearly that Europe’s leading by example will eventually pressure the UK into helping these innocent people.”\nFurther Reading:\nhttps://www.echo-news.co.uk/news/19995547.southend-campaigners-demand-uk-takes-ukrainian-refugees-now/\nhttps://www.greenparty.org.uk/news/2022/03/14/new-uk-visa-scheme-%E2%80%9Ca-pale-imitation%E2%80%9D-of-proper-refugee-support,-greens-warn/\nhttps://www.greenparty.org.uk/news/2022/03/10/greens-condemn-two-main-parties-for-compassion-failure-over-ukrainian-refugees/\nhttps://metro.co.uk/2021/11/24/priti-patel-is-spreading-stories-about-refugees-to-suit-her-own-agenda-15646553/",

These include Cllr Stuart Allen’s motion to ban carcinogenic Glyphosate weedkiller from our streets, Cllr Richard Longstaff’s urgent motion to preserve our natural assets, and other cross-party motions, including one to improve access to elections for the blind.\nAfter the meeting, Leigh Ward Councillor Richard Longstaff said;\n“Tonight’s council has been sabotaged by Labour, it’s deeply frustrating. The residents of Southend deserve better – they expect robust debate and fair discussion of the critical issues that affect them. Tonight, we had a whole suite of motions to be debated, but instead of meaningful dialogue, we’ve seen filibustering from Labour creating a dysfunctional situation.\n“Democracy is the principle that we work collaboratively to drive things forward to improve our city, not to waste time on more party-political matters that have little effect. What’s happened here is unreasonable, unfair, and that will be obvious to anyone watching. This isn’t what I joined the council for, and it’s disheartening for all of us here tonight. It’s ironic that my Group Leaders comments were on topic, reminding members of the democratic process, following last full councils less than favourable episodes”\nRichard concluded, “Any administration within council must facilitate democratic process, not stifle it”.\nCllr Stuart Allen said, “Constitutionally, we only have 3 and a half hours to discuss everything on the Full Council’s agenda. This means it’s really important to be efficient with that little time, and use the correct channels of Scrutiny and Working Parties to dissect the details in full. Due to the delays in progress on the night, I was forced to retract my motion on banning the use of Glyphosate, so that it can be discussed properly at the next Full Council meeting.”\n“It’s really disappointing. We’re elected to improve the lives of our residents, but partisan game-playing like this means that we cannot do that effectively. I hope that all councillors are mindful that our work should be getting on with delivering for residents by getting through the whole agenda in full at each session.”\nThe Council provides plenty of opportunities for the vast majority of elements to be discussed in other forums, including Scrutiny and working parties. The Greens therefore are now pushing for changes to the constitution to ensure agendas are gone through in full at each Full Council meeting.\n– ENDS –",

The contract for the Basildon plant states that ECC “owns” the plant output – so that it can trade it. The output is shredded and dried mixed household waste known as SRF.\nBut now that ownership of about 200,000 tonnes of SRF a year and the cost of having to dispose of it has become a financial headache for the county council.\nThe contract policy approved at Cabinet on 22nd September includes a plan on how the council will invite contractors to bid for SRF contracts in lots and also that the main 10 year contracts will begin in 2019/20. The total contract is sufficiently large that it has to be dealt with under European procurement rules, which require a fair and open market process.\nHowever, in a bizarre turn of events, Essex County Council’s planning department has issued a briefing note to the Witham MP Priti Patel about the current planning application to change the process balance of the proposed Rivenhall major waste site – an application which includes increasing the incineration capacity by 65%. In the briefing ECC states “RDF generated at Courtauld Road (the Basildon MBT) could be utilised in the Energy from Waste facility at Rivenhall, subject to contract”.\nGreen County Councillor James Abbott raised questions about this at the Cabinet meeting – as to how such a statement from the planning department of ECC is compatible with the waste procurement department at ECC operating a fair and open contract bidding process.\nCllr. James Abbott, Green Party District and County Councillor, and co-founder of the Stop The Incinerator campaign said\n“For 2 decades now, campaign groups have been questioning Essex County Council’s reliance on its monolithic waste strategy aim of having just 2 very large waste sites in Essex, through which up to half of all household waste in the county would not be recycled, but would be destined to be incinerated after being shredded and dried. This binary model – of Basildon and Rivenhall – featured in the first PFI bid that ECC submitted to the Government (though a subsequent bid relied on Basildon).\nWe have questioned how this approach is compatible with targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, what the risks are that it will stifle progress in recycling and what are the potential costs to taxpayers compared with a high recycling strategy based on the districts and boroughs. Repeatedly ECC has said their strategy was the right one.\nBut now that strategy looks to be going up in smoke. Far from being a “valuable” commodity to be traded, SRF could cost (on ECC’s own figures) Essex taxpayers £15 million a year to get rid of. The County Council is arguing this is a (marginal) saving over landfill costs on projected estimated figures, but what they are not doing is comparing the costs with the much better strategy of going for higher levels of recycling, which not only avoids landfill tax, it produces collected materials which can genuinely attract income in the market.\nECC’s strategy costs taxpayers at every stage – trucking waste to transfer stations (built with taxpayer money); trucking it down to the Basildon MBT (built with taxpayer money); trucking the SRF back out to be incinerated – which taxpayers will now have to pay private companies to take.\nWe have also since the 1990s questioned ECC’s approach to the proposed waste site at Rivenhall Airfield. ECC has repeatedly claimed that it is purely a private site and that they are just the planning authority dealing with applications. However ECC supported the applicant at the 2009 Planning Inquiry, including hiring a barrister at taxpayer expense to question local objectors. Information obtained under FoI has showed that ECC had also entered into a series of discussions and agreements (1) with the site owners about future cooperation should the plant be built. Now we see a briefing note from the planning department in which ECC directly links Rivenhall to a potential contract to take ECC owned SRF – a contract which could be worth £ millions to the operators of the Rivenhall plant. ECC needs to explain this briefing especially as they will be deciding on the latest planning application for the site in the next few months. The Leader of ECC has pledged to respond to me on this issue.\nSenior Conservatives at ECC have repeatedly criticised Greens and others for challenging their approach (2) and claim that we do not have an alternative. This is simply untrue. Essex Green Party and other groups have for many years had a policy of aiming for at least 70% recycling by 2020, based on expanding local recycling, composting and materials recovery via the districts and boroughs. This strategy would avoid the need to spend so much taxpayers money on transfer stations, the Basildon plant, excessive haulage or SRF disposal. We have supported the development of local processing facilities on suitable sites such as existing industrial areas – which means that waste can be treated locally, not trucked backwards and forwards across the county clogging up the roads and adding to air pollution. ECC’s endgame has always been to burn a large fraction of ECC household waste, which will pump greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and produce toxins which will lower local air quality and contaminate soils and water – filters cannot take all of the “nasties” out.\nFinally, ECC and the Rivenhall waste plant applicants have failed to explain their claim that Basildon and Rivenhall are “recycling facilities” or that the energy produced from burning SRF would be “renewable”.\nThe reality is that only about 10 to 15% of the tonnage going into Basildon will get recycled. For Rivenhall, based on the new application, it is just 19%.\nOnly the bio fraction of SRF (wood, paper, cardboard, food – which should in any case be mostly recycled) can legally qualify as producing renewable energy. Most of the energy produced by burning SRF is not renewable because of the high content of non-bio materials such as plastics.”\nNotes\n- A Confidentiality Agreement was signed between ECC and the Rivenhall waste site promoters and draft joint access arrangements were discussed. Rivenhall was modelled as taking the outputs from Basildon in the first ECC PFI bid to Government.\n- Over a decade ago, Lord Hanningfield, as the then Leader of Essex County Council, stated that Greens were “political scaremongers” for saying an incinerator was being planned in Essex to take household waste – and specifically at Rivenhall Airfield. Yet documents in the public domain and those secured under FoI have repeatedly pointed to this outcome since this planning saga on the airfield began in the 1990s.",

  "https_southeastessex_greenparty_org_uk_/https_southeastessex_greenparty_org_uk_news_2022_03_24_greens-challenge-council-on-ev-infrastructure/content_22.html": "This evening, our branch coordinator James Vessey-Miller attended the meeting of Southend City Council.\nAsking the council two written questions, James challenged the council over the impending crisis that will be publicly accessible electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure in Southend-on-Sea.\nCurrently, Southend has only 9.8 publicly-accessible charging points per 100,000 people. A paltry figure when compared to Milton Keynes, with 137.3 charging points per 100,000 people. The council themselves operate six of the town’s EV charging locations, and at the time of writing, just two were operative. We argue this is simply not good enough.\nHe said;\n“Since the council declared a Climate Emergency back in 2019, the council has been taking small but necessary steps to ensure that the borough reaches Carbon Neutrality by 2030; a direction welcomed by the city’s environmental groups.\nAs councillors will be aware, one of the biggest Carbon emissions for the city is from the sector of transport. Residents know full well the traffic chaos the city suffers already, and this worsening in congestion is only set to increase as the city’s population grows. With this worsening congestion comes worsening carbon emissions and as a further consequence, worsening air quality. This issue is already such to the extent that several of the city’s AQMA’s have already recorded illegally-unsafe levels of pollutants, near schools and residential areas.\nWhilst Electric Vehicles are not exclusively the solution to these problems, they are a required step in rapidly decarbonising transit, and will be a core component to the city achieving its 2030 Carbon goals. Many residents are already investing in EVs, and that trend is set to continue over the coming years with new legislation preventing the sale of new internal combustion vehicles from 2030.\nIn this light, the council needs to urgently review the existing EV charging infrastructure across the city. Currently, there are 10 publicly-accessible charging locations in operation, facilitating just 22 EVs charging at any one time. Of the six PodPoint sites managed by the council, just two are working, with four whole sites currently inoperative. This is simply insufficient to facilitate this rising EV ownership across the city.\nJust last week, CarGuide.co.uk ranked Southend-on-Sea as the third-worst place in the country to own an EV, as it has only 9.8 charging points per 100,000 people. Compare and contrast that to Milton Keynes, with 137.3 charging points per 100,000 people, and the problem is obvious.\nThe large majority of Southend’s residents don’t have access to off-street parking to facilitate charging at home, and the business community cannot be relied upon exclusively to install the required points on their own property. As such, council-operated public charging infrastructure will be vital in enabling this electrification, especially in residential areas.\nCan the portfolio holder outline how the Council intends to meet the growing demand for EV charging points, and further, what steps the council are taking to incorporate new EV charging points into street furniture on residential roads across the city?\nThe Cabinet Member for Environment, Culture, Tourism, and Planning, Cllr Mulroney responded by saying:\nElectric vehicles are part of the council’s transport decarbonisation programme and wider modal shift to active modes of travel. The council will be taking an evidence-based approach to the rollout of appropriate EV charging infrastructure in optimal locations that aligns and integrates with the forthcoming local plan and Local Transport Plan 4. A feasibility study will shortly be undertaken to understand the infrastructure challenges that the city face which includes disparate substation coverage and property-adjacent street furniture.\nOn completion of the feasibility study, officers will be able to establish a criteria that will maximise charging points for residents within the structural parameters of the city, taking a test and trial approach which will take place in parallel to resident engagement and discussions with UKPN to establish a medium-term plan for improving network infrastructure.\nElectric vehicles are not the silver bullet, the aim of the council is not to replace combustion engines journeys with an equal number of electric vehicle journeys, but to move to a sustainable transport system where vehicle journeys are replaced by walking, cycling, and public transport where possible, and network congestion is minimised.”\nTheir answer:\nMore kicking the can down the road with more “feasibility studies”.",
  "https_southeastessex_greenparty_org_uk_/https_southeastessex_greenparty_org_uk_news_2015_02_15_candidate-for-southend-west-constituency-announced/content_223.html": "Jon sets out here his reasons for standing for the Green Party in the Southend West constituency.\nLots of people will know me as Jon Fuller, the chap who campaigns against polluting activities, like the proposed Estuary Airport scheme and expansion of Southend Airport. I have chaired some of the largest public meetings the town has ever seen and helped very many residents form action groups to oppose developments that would damage the environment.\nIn October 2014 I joined the Green Party and asked if it would permit me to stand at the coming general election. This is why……\nI was a member of the Labour Party until the early 1980’s, when I felt that it left me. While it is true that I stopped paying my subs, I actually felt it had changed into something different – “New Labour”; and it had abandoned many of the things people like me believed in. Those of us who opposed crushing inequality and who supported compassionate politics didn’t fit with the Blair/Brown vision. Despite the change in leadership Labour continues to support ‘austerity politics’, the philosophy that is causing grinding inequality, making the super-rich a heck of a lot richer. Nearly 1 million people turned to food-banks last year to survive and Labour will do little to alleviate that.\nIn 2010 the most extraordinary thing had happened – Labour had drifted so far away from its roots that it sat on the centre-right of British politics, with the Lib-Dems positioned as the party of the centre-left. So, here in Southend West, with our first past the post system, many felt it made sense for progressive, socially compassionate people to vote Lib-Dem. Plus, in Peter Welch (who stood in 2010), we were offered an eco-aware candidate who understood that Southend was the wrong place to build a busy regional airport.\nIn May 2015, the landscape will be very different. Peter cannot stand this time and the Lib-Dem vote is likely to collapse. The electorate has one important function to perform, beyond the obvious role of casting a vote on the ballot paper – we have to punish a political party if it promises one thing and delivers another. That is what the Lib-Dems have done – they positioned themselves as a left of centre party but delivered a hard right agenda. The age of austerity brought a vicious assault upon the living standards of the great mass of people. We expect that of the Conservative Party, not of progressive politicians; so it is entirely understandable that the Lib-Dems will lose millions of votes in 2015.\nIn 2010 Barry Bolton stood for the Green Party but he is unable to stand this year and so, without a Green Party candidate, there was a danger those of us who seek eco-aware politics would have no one to vote for. Faced with that stark reality I asked the party for permission to stand.\nIn 2010 the Green Party secured just 1.5% of the vote, with 46% going to the sitting Conservative MP (Sir David Amess). Despite the odds, I entered this in part because there is an incredibly small amount of time left to tackle climate change and avert catastrophe. Scientists warn we are on the cusp of the runaway greenhouse effect. Our planet has lost 40% of its wildlife in just 40 years. By offering a Green Party option I wanted to give the electorate one last chance to say … “Not In My Name”!\nHowever, since my campaign got underway on 24th January, I was astonished by the scale of support from people who feel the same way that I do – that Labour and LibDems do not care enough for the poor and refuse to tax the super-rich fairly. The public meetings I have attended, telephone and e-mails I have received, have shown that people want an alternative. I didn’t expect this but I have also heard from former Conservative Party voters who feel the party is behaving in a brutal manner and has gone too far. People don’t want to see huge pay rises for MPs and vast bonuses for bankers, while nurses and others get below inflation rises.\nIn October 2014 I thought that the Green Party could not win this seat, but I wanted to give considerate, caring people a voice. However, with Labour, the Lib-Dems and even the Conservatives driving people away, it is clear that the Green Party’s share of the vote is going to surge. If you seek social justice, care for the weak, a fairer society then now is the time to drop the ‘LibLabCon’ and join us.\nVery occasionally politics and political systems are challenged and transformed. In May 2015 we can do exactly that.",

With phrases like “right-sizing” and “fit-for-purpose” being used by the Labour-led administration in relation to services, Ms. Mitchell fears they could be code for further budget cuts that threaten vital community resources.\nMs. Mitchell raised her concerns about family centres, which she believes could play a critical role in preventing family crises and delivering a multi agency community based approach that responds to the communities identified needs.\n“These are frontline services that provide essential support to residents,” Kay said.\n“Libraries too are more than just places to borrow books – they act as a one-stop shop for residents, offering everything from waste bags to guidance on council services. We should be future-proofing these spaces, not cutting back on them. I’d like to see them evolve into ‘libraries of everything,’ offering services like tool lending and household items.”\nCllr Richard Longstaff, Leader of the Green Group, added, “Kay’s concerns about the future of family centres and libraries in Southend are ones I share. These spaces are invaluable to the community, offering vital resources that more than justify their cost. Any proposals for cuts – or sugar-coating as ‘right-sizing’ – are simply unacceptable, now or in future budgets. Instead, we must invest in ensuring these spaces not only meet the demands of the future but expand their reach, so more residents can access the essential services the council provides.”\nThe Green Party has long argued for long-term investment in front-line services, arguing that cutting such support only exacerbates the issues facing the city. Ms. Mitchell’s call for a comprehensive approach is a reminder of the ongoing tension between short-term savings and long-term community health.\n– ENDS –\nNotes to editor:\nKay Mitchell will be asking Cllr Laurie Burton at the Full Council meeting on the 20th February the following:\nUnder ‘Ongoing Commitment to those residents most in need of support’ it says:\nThe council has commenced a fundamental review of the Council’s operational estate and front-line service arrangements including Libraries and Family Centres.\nThe Labour led administration currently favours the terminology of ‘Rightsizing’ and ‘fit for purpose’ but I see these as alternative words for cuts rather than purposefully developing the underutilised facilities offered by our libraries and family centres. These could be embedded with a much wider scope in the community support offer, coproduced to meet resident’s needs, wrapped around multi agency delivery and core to early intervention. The leader responded in P&R that there would be no cuts to these services, but mentioned only ‘the slipper swap’ as an offer example.\nWhat reassurance can the council give that the review intends to ensure the broadest possible range of sustainable services. embedded within residents’ communities?",

There is also a lack of financial resources in this sector and there is nothing to suggest extra funding will be made available. In our opinion the plans are short-sighted as they are based around non-existent resources; we fear that this will put patients at risk as services required by some will be unavailable.\nThroughout the consultation, there is a huge reliance on pre-hospital care and prevention of attendances. As Southend has the second highest vacancy rate for GPs in the UK at present and the second highest number of GPs due to retire within the next 5 years, why is there such reliance on primary care to prevent hospital admission? What will happen if results are unable to be delivered?\nWe understand that there is a need to review the current provision and that a combination of an ageing population, shrinking staff base, and many years of underfunding have put the trusts under significant pressure.\nWe duly note that there is a strong emphasis on cost-cutting strategies with terms such as;\n‘reduction and restriction of low-value procedures‘ [from 9:5:2].\nAs this description is lacking inner detail, we would like a clarification of the following concerns:\n• What type of procedures will this include?\n• Who decides what is ‘of value’?\n• Will this result in older patients being prevented from having certain treatments?\nWe also note that there is the reference to treatment at Integrated Neighbourhood Hubs;\n• Where will these be located?\n• How will these be funded?\n• How will these be staffed?\nReliance on Technology\nWe are concerned with what we have read on P136 (P186) with regards to investment in Apps/Self-Care Technology. Our background research has taught us that there are services such as this already being advertised in London on bus stops (i.e.. GP at Hand) as an alternative GP service. We are concerned that signing up to use these services require patients to de-register from their current GP, in order to register for an online service. This process then leaves people without a physical GP.\nAre there any plans in place to assist people to re-register with a physical GP if this service did not meet expectations or was no longer suitable for the patients’ needs (not all conditions/illnesses etc. are accepted/able to be treated). At present these services are free at the point of use, is there any assurance on this always being the case?\nIncreasing reliance on such services excludes certain sectors of the population; not all of the older generation (and we are constantly reminded that the problems are due to the ageing population) have access to, nor are comfortable using computers, tablets or smartphones. I am sure that those without direct access would not wish to have to use such a service in the public library. There would also be barriers to accessing services such as this for those with visual problems, learning difficulties and other disabilities.\nFrom a patient perspective, how good a service can really be provided by an App, Skype or teleconferencing? Are those behind this confident that they can provide services in the best interest of the patient via this facility? What is the risk of misdiagnosis when an appointment is not carried out face-to-face? Is this just seen as collateral damage?\nFinances\nThere has been emphasis placed on the £118M capital funding that is to be shared between the three sites. However, as this is only available if certain conditions are met and it has restricted uses, it is clearly overshadowed by the £30M annual cuts that are being imposed on each of the three sites.\nThere is reference to Non-Specific investment in local health care infrastructure, which is stated ‘could be funded in several different ways’ but the plans for consultation do not provide any details on what the funding options are.\nSection 9.3 refers to Investments and Value for money; there is reference to unlocking further savings in a number of ways including:\nTargeted new services in primary and community care. We would like to know;\n• What services are going to be transferred to P&C Care?\n• There is reference to ‘up-skilling’ primary care staff, but is this at the detriment to other staff?\nWe are not surprised to have read that the nance section also makes reference to ‘Redundancies in the acute sector’ but we would like to know;\n• Will these redundancies be voluntary or compulsory? • How many jobs are at risk in their current form?\n• What will they be treating?\nThere is also reference within the nance section to ‘End of Life services and pathway redesign’ what is meant by this; does this mean that patients will be given less (or no choice) in how they spend their final days? The nance chapter seems to be a highly inappropriate area to make reference to such a sensitive topic relating to patients care; reducing our confidence that these plans are purely in the interest of the patients.\nClinical Assurance\nChapter 10 focuses on the clinical assurance behind the decisions that are being taken. There are clearly barriers to the information and understanding in this area, as the information and content of the report was not included in the pre-consultation business case and had to be requested separately.\nWe are concerned that this does not stand up to scrutiny given that the Eastern Academic Science Health Networks own independent report within the key summary of findings (P4) cites the limited availability of research and published literature relating to the exact model proposes and that as a consequence reliance upon judgements have been made in many areas. We would also ask what assurance can be provided over the true independence of the evidence base used.\nFurthermore, as the key summary of findings also acknowledged that any outputs will open to debate, what evidence can then be provided to convince the public that the findings are robust enough to support any decisions based on them?\nGiven that the published literature review (that has been given a 60% weighting in this instance) is based on some articles that are almost 30 years old, and that not all the published literature is related to the UK specifically, with a higher proportion of published literature used from countries abroad who do not have the same health care system as in the UK. How can members of the public reading this information have the confidence that the decisions based on the clinical assurance will be to the benet of and not to the detriment of the patients of Mid and South Essex?\nOur research into the clinical assurance basis for the proposals has raised concerns that there is not a specific local knowledge within the Senate Council; with none of the members being based at the 3 main sites under consideration. The only link to the local area is a GP member of one of the local CCG’s with over 20 other members coming from a wider geographical area.\nWith a high proportion of the membership coming from more rural – less densely populated areas, they are unlikely to experience the high volumes of traffic and congestion that is common in the areas between the three sites. Why are the decision makers not individuals with experience and knowledge of the local area which changes will impact?\nFurthermore, the Senate membership encompasses a broad range of specialism for different fields, but is lacking clinicians from the three sites in question and individuals with direct links to the services under reconfiguration.\nLast summer the public learnt that the previous plans to downgrade Southend and Basildon A&E departments were not backed by the local clinicians. The current plans lack details of local clinicians backing them either. Can you provide details and evidence of the which local clinicians are explicitly and wholly backing these plans for reconfiguration?\nOther Services\nThe reconfiguration of maternity services refers to a Single Centre for High-Risk Births/co-led units at all sites/Level 2 neonatal at all sites. Not all births are complex before they begin; things can change during labour. Would all centres be able to perform emergency C-Sections? Higher staffing levels than at present would be required for the new model post-reconfiguration; would staff recruitment and retention be adequate to meet these requirements?\nWe accept that the planned HASU, developed in conjunction with local consultants and if fully funded and implemented properly, would be a major step forward for improved patient care and outcomes. However, we are concerned that not all the resources required for delivery of this currently exist within the STP.\nWith the additional funding only being made available from separate commission funding, (which has not yet been clearly defined) this would suggest that the proposals have been released too soon, and a longer amount of time should be taken over the drafting of these plans and any decision due to be taken in summer 2018 delayed until actually defined plans can be put before the public; for an area that would appear to be the central key area of focus.\nDecisions have been made regarding paediatrics despite there being no evidence related directly to the configuration proposals. It has been stated that currently there is less than optimal staff in current configuration, how would this be resolved by the creation of a specialist centre, and post-reconfiguration, would staff recruitment and retention be adequate? The plans state there would be a PAU on each or the three sites but does not make clear the hours these services would be provided. Would there be 24/7 PAU on all three sites?\nTransport\nWe have concerns that the plans put forward to public scrutiny are not detailed enough in some areas. One of area of concern in this respect is the arrangements for transporting sick patients between sites. When questions were raised regarding this at a recent public meeting, the panel were unable to provide any detail as to how this would be put in place, who would be responsible for it’s operation, and how this function would be adequately staffed.\nA transfer service of the nature proposed would require specialist staff. As the numbers of Doctors and Nurses are already at a critically low level, what assurance can be provided that sufficiently qualified staff can be recruited and retained to allow access the ‘specialist care?’ With an ambulance service already failing to fill its many vacancies and respond to even life-threatening calls within an acceptable timeframe, this is clearly not a safe or feasible option. How can the public have confidence that these plans can be safely delivered?\nWe also feel that plans to transfer non-critical patients bettween sites is dangerously vague. There is a suggestion that there would be a free bus service linking the three sites; however, in many cases, this is going to result in additional journeys for patients. A patient from Benfleet would have to travel to Southend Hospital to subsequently then get a bus to Broomfield. What studies have been conducted to consider the environmental impact on the extra emergency and non-emergency journeys that will occur? Will these services be provided 24/7 or could patients nd themselves being discharged at Broomeld out of hours with no way of making their way home to Shoeburyness?\nConclusions\nWhile we do not wish to be perceived as overly-negative to the plans you have put forward, we are of the overall opinion that current proposals lack sufcient detail to be given our backing or approval as a party.\nWe do not concur that everything put forward would be solely in the interest of the patients in Mid and South Essex, nor do we believe there has been adequate support from clinicians based at the sites.\nWe would like to see any decision on these proposals delayed until more concrete plans can be presented to a further public consultation, where we would hope to see substantiated evidence-based detail and support from clinicians; from where we can then form a more grounded and reasoned opinion.\nFrom our observations there is a slack of open publicity surrounding the plans. We have heard reports of staff members within the trust not being aware of the reconguration, and a lack of publicity material available around the hospital, in GP surgeries and other medical and public buildings, giving us concerns that general members of the public are not properly informed on these matters.\nAt the recent public meeting it was re-enforced several times that “this is not a referendum” which very much comes across that public opinion would not be given the correct amount of weight in the decision-making process.\nWe hope that this perception is unfounded, and we look forward to receiving your responses to our concerns; hopefully before the end of the consultation period.\nYours faithfully,\nSouth East Essex Green Party.\nFor the latest news and Updates on the #SaveSouthendNHS campaign against the STP reconfiguration scheme, please follow Save Southend NHS on their Social Media channels and see their Website.",

In that respect alone, they have failed as Councillors.\nTowards the end of the meeting, already gone midnight, they had a chance to support a well-drafted letter stating our total disgust at the plan to merge the three Mid & South Essex Hospitals into a single organisation; which has been carried out in secret with no scrutiny or due diligence.\nWhipped without emotion, the Conservatives voted unanimously against recognising the letter.\nThe Tories showed us what we clearly now need to do; That is to engage the whole population in taking back our NHS and putting it in the hands of clinicians and far out of the reach of the politicians who have made the NHS a political weapon for over 40 years.\nThe #SaveSouthendNHS Campaign have also officially commented on the Council meeting:\n“We are very glad that the message of our CROSS-PARTY campaign appears to finally be getting through – despite ‘certain people’ attempting to smear us.\nThe very stark consensus about the Mid and South Essex STP is that they have delivered an exceedingly poor public consultation with little transparency, poor process and just 0.04% of the 1.5 million catchment area have actually engaged. Councillors are cross that they are still awaiting answers to many questions, especially surrounding both patient and visitor transport provision and meeting the workforce demands.\nCllr. Lesley Salter, Portfolio Holder for the Health and Wellbeing board states that “we have excellent stroke services at Southend and they should not be moved,” however maintains that separation of planned and emergency care is “needed” and that “specialist centres” will attract more staff and improve outcomes.\nShe also said the evidence supports this – it doesn’t.\nWe would like to know precisely how she has come to this conclusion, bearing in mind there has been no staff survey on their wishes to work at a so-called ‘specialist centre’ and in fact, if the STP reconfiguration goes ahead and staff are expected to work across sites, many will leave and go and work in London where there is London weighting. #SaveSouthendNHS are just glad that there remains a large amount of scepticism from Councillors and that most appear to be taking the proposals to transfer critically ill local residents all around Essex for treatment, very seriously.\nThe whole meeting will be available in the council archive to view in a few days time.”\nWe would ideally love for all our members to (if not already done) follow the Save Southend NHS campaign on Facebook and the @NHSUnited twitter page.\nIf you have a skillset or access to anything which may be useful to the campaign, please message the campaign and let them know so we can increase the already great expertise, making the group amongst the most successful campaigns in the country.\nWe will be attending a protest under the Railway Bridge in Southend High Street on Saturday, March 3rd at 12 noon.\nOrganised by Fighting For our NHS (Essex) as part of a national protest day, the whole country will be holding similar events to raise awareness that our NHS is under threat, and it will send a clear message that the NHS is NOT FOR SALE.\nWe also hold a fun but important ‘Regular Presence’ on the traffic reservation in front of the A&E at Southend University Hospital every Monday and Friday from 13:00 until 14:00 and we often theme these meetings.\nThis is in recognition of the people we value, the staff of the Hospital who keep us alive. These are planned to continue until Friday, March 9th (the end of consultation) Depending on the direction campaigning takes after that date, they may be set to continue for some time.\nWe are also keen for people to volunteer to leaflet the streets near their homes as awareness of this issue is still not 100% and we would hate for people to lose their NHS without having the chance to fight back.\nWe will hold a protest outside the Consultation meeting to be held on Wednesday, March 7th and there will be details of that posted on the Save Southend NHS sites closer to the time.\nAs a Party, the Green Party is very aware of all aspects of this matter and we feel it is so important that we make sure our members are as aware as possible of all developments so we can act as a strong partner to our wider community.\nThe monumental effort from the campaigners themselves continues…\nThe STP and supporters regularly cite specific scientific papers to support their scheme.\nCrucially, many campaigners argue that most of the “clinical evidence” put forward by the STP is either outdated or taken out of context.\nAs ever, the #SaveSouthendNHS team decided to actually read the papers the STP casually cites as supporting evidence:\nWHAT DOES THE STP’s “EVIDENCE” REALLY SAY?\n“The STP list a whole load of scientific papers to back up their plans to reduce services in our local hospitals and concentrate them in ‘Specialist Centres’, but what do these papers ACTUALLY say about creating larger, higher volume centres? See for yourself:\n“Because most of the studies we reviewed were based on data from the 1980s to mid-1990s, the extent to which their findings reflect current practice and volume is unclear.” [Halm et al, 2002]\n“Some low-volume providers have good outcomes, and some high-volume providers have poor outcomes.“ [Halm et al, 2002]\n“Even when a significant association exists, volume does not predict outcome well for individual hospitals or physicians.” [Halm et al, 2002]\n“.. hospitals that transfer patients after primary surgery back to a referring (often smaller and lower volume) hospital may have better outcomes because patients who develop complications or die are more likely to do so in the referring institution. [Chowdhury, 2007]\n“The smaller but more reliable sample of prospective studies demonstrated that when this (point made above) and other potential inaccuracies are minimized, the benefit from high hospital volume is limited” [Chowdhury, 2007]\nDamned by their own evidence?\nReferences:\nChowdhury, M. M., Dagash, H., & Pierro, A. (2007). A systematic review of the impact of volume of surgery and specialization on patient outcome. British journal of surgery, 94(2), 145-161.\nHalm, E. A. et al. (2002) Is volume related to outcome in health care? A systematic review and methodologic critique of the literature. Annals of internal medicine, 137(6), 511-520.”\nLOVE SOUTHEND NHS\nIn possibly the most obvious move of political band-wagoning in recent memory, the Southend Conservatives have recently launched their own NHS-themed campaign creatively named ‘Love Southend NHS.‘\nThe campaign launch, predictably coinciding on the same day Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt arrived in Shoeburyness to help MP James Dudderidge leaflet for Cllr James Moyies in Thorpe Ward, is rather evidently a two-dimensional move to subvert the very real concern that the local Conservatives are doing nothing to safeguard our local NHS services from dismantling.\nRather than actually hold the STP to account over the ongoing £30M cuts to our public health services, the campaign instead publicises the STP’s own material, and the clear architect of this campaign, Cllr Moyies, uses the campaign’s Twitter feed to self-congratulate his “Great initiative & leadership.”\nPlease don’t fall for this ruse.\nThe Southend Conservatives “Love Southend NHS” as much as most of us love sexual diseases.\nOur continued involvement in the campaign is one of a number of things the local Green Party are working with residents and cross-party groups on as part of our aim to pragmatically demonstrate that community has to always be of more importance than any individual politically point-scoring.\nUltimately, Our NHS is more important than any election result.\nThis article and the opinions expressed within does not represent the views of the cross-party #SaveSouthendNHS campaign.\nThis article uses excerpts from the #SaveSouthendNHS campaign literature and published media.\nThey have a wealth of well-researched literature, and the scale of it is astonishing.\nPlease find visit the campaign Website and Social Media for a more in-depth read of their material.",

He goes on to complain about the ‘previous administration’s’ removal of Litter bins, conveniently forgetting his party has controlled Southend Council for the last two years.\nHe also briefly grazes over the ‘Better Queensway’ scheme, which in our opinion, is one of the most important issues in the ward, if not the town.\nYou can read our analysis of the Queensway developments here:\nWe believe there is a better, harder-working candidate in the election in Victoria Ward;\nClare Fletcher is the Green Party Candidate for Victoria Ward.\nYou can read about Clare and the amazing work she is already undertaking on the Candidates section of our website.",

  "https_southeastessex_greenparty_org_uk_/https_southeastessex_greenparty_org_uk_news_2020_05_28_seaway-scheme-approved-by-council/content_241.html": "On Wednesday’s crucial Development Control Committee, a narrow margin of councillors voted in favour of granting planning permission to the controversial scheme.\nDespite staunch opposition from neighbouring residents and vocal pleas from many seafront businesses, a proposal to refuse the scheme was narrowly rejected by seven votes to nine and the majority voted in favour of the plans.\nThe Green Party have campaigned against these plans since 2015 when the Conservative administration leased the land at Seaway Car Park to the developers, Turnstone Southend Ltd, for just £1.00.\nIt is thought that a major influence behind the council’s decision is that if the scheme is rejected, the council would be forced to repay the government £3m which has already been invested in the project.\nWhat is the Seaway Leisure Complex?\nIn late 2015, plans were announced for a major redevelopment on the land at Seaway car park, one of the largest car parking areas serving the main seafront attractions. The land at Seaway was controversially leased to the developer Turnstone Estates, by the then-Conservative administration for just £1.00, in a deal which would see Turnstone foot the bill for the development and future rents going to the council.\nThis scheme was one of the many white-elephant vanity projects peddled by the Conservative administration, and it has since garnered support from the recent Labour/Independent/Liberal alliance.\nFollowing the loss of initial support from Cineworld, in 2017 Empire Cinemas was announced as a new investing partner into the scheme alongside Travelodge Hotels, with later Hollywood Bowl committing to the scheme in early 2018.\n(Plans for the scheme were submitted in December 2018.)\nIn late 2018, Turnstone Estates submitted a planning application for a development consisting;\n- a six-storey, 80-bedroom Travelodge hotel,\n- a 20-lane Hollywood Bowling alley,\n- an 11-screen Empire Cinema with IMAX facilities,\n- active attractions including an indoor golf course, a climbing wall, and a gym,\n- 10 new restaurants and cafes,\n- a new public realm and landscaped square surrounding St John The Baptist church,\n- and a new 555 space multi-storey car park.\nA two-year planning dispute followed the planning application, with many residents and major seafront businesses airing their concerns over issues from a reduction in parking provision, the duplication of existing facilities in the town, and overall visual impact on the area.\nFighting largely over a 100-space decrease in seafront parking provision, Adventure Island was a staunch opponent of the scheme saying: “All we ask is that Southend Borough Council values Southend tourism and recognises that this development is wrong for the town.”\nWith the contract nearing expiry, the developer lodged an appeal to the planning decision, and the Council have now buckled. This scheme now only requires government approval.\nGreen Party candidate for Leigh Ward, Thomas Love offers his thoughts:\n“As a former employee of the Odeon in Southend, I know how important it is to so many of us.\nI believe the building serves a purpose beyond just a cinema; I honestly see it as the heart of the High Street. Even if you disregard all the time spent watching films there, it’s a landmark when asking for directions, a warm place to duck into while waiting to meet friends and yes… it seems to be the town’s most popular loo!\nIn fact, due to its late opening hours, the Odeon has even been used by vulnerable people seeking help at night on rare occasions.\nI include myself in the countless number of people whose first ‘no-grownups’ outing was to the Odeon. For so many parents to trust the Odeon with their children’s independence is a testament to the safe environment the staff are able to maintain. It helps that the Odeon at Southend couldn’t be better positioned for public transport, being a minutes’ walk from a train station, several bus stops and a taxi rank.\nSome may argue that an additional cinema in Southend would bring a wider variety of film screenings but this argument holds little weight when the smallest amount of scrutiny is applied to it. As an 8-screen multiplex with over 1500 seats, Odeon Southend can and does regularly screen indie films, foreign cinema and documentaries when massive blockbusters dominate smaller cinemas.”\nYou can read Thomas’ full article here:\nThe Green Party View:\nOur belief is that such a significant development was a landmark opportunity to improve a large part of the Town centre for better. We support the use of brownfield land such as Seaway for the sustainable development of our town, and we do not object to it being developed on. Such a site could have played host to some amazing leisure and commercial attractions that add to the existing offer of the town, rather than seeking to undermine and undercut existing ones as this current plan does.\nWe cannot support this development because of the following:\nCinema:\nThe existing ODEON cinema at the head of the high street is already a fantastic facility for the town. Building another much-bigger cinema just a short walk from the existing one will cause untold damage to that business’ trade, and potentially (and unnecessarily) risks the jobs of the ODEON employees, and further risks the town yielding yet another large empty building with no use if the existing cinema ceases trading.\nBowling Alley:\nThe town’s beloved Kursaal, an iconic listed landmark with a perilously uncertain future. For years it has hosted the town’s main Bowling alley. In early 2019, MFA closed the bowling alley in the Kursaal, with many customers and residents suggesting that the Seaway’s proposed bowling alley was a major contributing factor to the company’s decision.\nWithout this bowling alley, the Kursaal now faces a situation where it is predominantly empty, sparking fresh concerns over the safety and policing of it. As recent history shows us, empty buildings in Southend have an unsettlingly-high chance of suffering devastating arson attacks. Finding a new use for the Kursaal now needs to be a top priority for the Council if we are to ensure its longevity.\nTown Centre Retail:\nThe town’s High Street is struggling. Following the loss of some major retailers, the future for the High Street looks grey. With a shifting customer base moving to online deliveries, and with a council that seems to view the High Street only as an opportunity to build luxury housing, our town centre seriously needs rejuvenating. Both of the town centre shopping centres (The Royals, and The Victoria) are half-empty, with struggling and declining footfall. Southend High Street is failing to compete with the internet and the megamalls of Lakeside and Bluewater.\nThe kinds of leisure and restaurant businesses this development will attract will be good for local employment, and will hopefully encourage more people into our town centre. Our concern is that with the creation of this retail zone annexed from the High Street, the significant shift in footfall patterns might lead to further complications for our struggling shopping centres, inadvertently creating a new shopping area that rivals rather than supplements our High Street.\nWe are saddened by this decision, and we reject the assertions from Independent and Labour councillors that such a development will be beneficial for our town and ailing High Street.\nThe concerns we have with this scheme remain unaddressed, and we fear that without proper assistance and investment from our Council, the future of our High Street is uncertain.\nThe final decision on this development now rests with the Secretary of State.\nFurther Reading:\nhttps://smartplanning.co.uk/application-for-seaway-leisure-scheme-in-southend-submitted/\nhttps://www.yellowad.co.uk/southend-tells-government-50million-seaway-leisure-development-should-go-ahead/",

The current quote is a final figure of £40m – an already excessive figure that does not take into account the cost of hiring two separate architectural firms and the various surveying and assessments conducted on the site by the Council to date.\nThe figure also does not account for the £3.7million already spent by the council in 2012 to conduct remedial piling work to secure the unstable site.This figure of £40m is disputed by SKIPP, who put the likely total cost of the project around £65-70m, well over double the initial cost.\nPARKING\nThere is a proposed 200-space basement carpark to be built across two subterranean floors underneath the museum building.\nWith the planned development on the Queensway (Essex Street & Short Street) Car Parks and Seaway Car Parks, central town parking will soon see a dramatic reduction. Just the loss of the Seaway facility alone will see a deficit of 661 spaces.\nMany residents are concerned that any further reduction in town centre parking will result in a higher number of visitors illegally parking in residential areas – something the locals are already seeing more of.\nSIZE\nThere is a huge discrepancy in the documents published by the council regarding the size of the development.\nThere is currently planning permission for a 20,00 sq ft building subject to detailed drawings being published.However, the AEW proposals detailed a massive 107,639sq ft complex recessed into the cliff.\nThe situation is yet further confused by the new drawings from current architects HB not yet being published, although it is widely believed to be similar in size to the AEW proposals.\nPutting the size in perspective – the giant Royals Shopping Centre is 280,000sq ft.Having a complex half the size of the Royals positioned on the geologically unstable ground, fronting a conservation area of amazing beauty sounds like a disaster waiting to happen.\nDESIGN\n“An exciting new iconic museum for Southend-On-Sea.’Translation: Ultra-modern and Ugly.” – SKIPP\nMany residents cite the building’s ultra-modern and garish design as one of the common objections.\nThe site proposed lies within the Milton Conservation area, and the aesthetic qualities of these proposed buildings do not coexist visually with the neighbouring Georgian buildings.\nENVIRONMENTAL OBJECTIONS\nAs the local Green Party, many of our primary concerns regard the Environmental impact of building this site.\nOur first, and main objection to these proposals is the development of the cliff itself.The land is Green Belt and is not to be built on under any circumstances, especially not in a residential or commercial capacity.\nWe believe building this ‘Thames Experience’ potentially threatens the remainder of the Clifftown Gardens and sets a precedent for construction of these large-scale buildings on Green Belt land within the borough.\nWe are also greatly concerned by further deforestation on the site, and the impact the facility will have on local Air and Noise Pollution – issues that Southend currently has a terrible record of.\nWe also echo the residents’ concerns about the construction traffic and its negative impact on the quality of life for locals.\nGEOLOGICAL CONCERNS\nThe site on which this development is planned, IS geologically unstable.\nThe site is situated on London Clay and features three powerful underground streams running within the site perimeter.\nThe site is also a High-Risk flood environment, and any subterranean carpark will flood like clockwork every year.\nThis regular flooding will also threaten the stability of the foundations of the site, just as it did with Esplanade Pub.\nALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS\nPart of the Council’s insistence on the complex being the mammoth size it is was the apparent need to house the Planetarium, Beecroft Art Gallery, and the Southend Museum with its vast collection – most of which has been in storage for years.\nWhen the plans for the museum were first launched, the Beecroft Art Gallery was housed in the former site opposite the Cliffs Pavilion. The former site was suffering from major structural issues and needed a new site.\nWith the relocation of the Southend Library to The Forum, after a long campaign by local groups, the Beecroft was moved into its new home in the old library building in Victoria Avenue next to the Museum. A fantastic building, and a wonderful centre-town resource, the current Beecroft Gallery is now also home to the Hive Enterprise centre.\nThe Southend Museum and Planetarium is currently located in the Central Museum on Victoria Avenue.The Building, which was opened initially as the Free Library in 1905, and repurposed into a Museum in 1981 is a Grade II Listed building and an architectural treasure.\nSouthend Council argues that many of the Town’s collections of relics and treasures – including the Saxon King Saebert, and the wreckage of the HMS London – has been kept in storage due to the space limitations at the relatively small current site.\nThe South East Essex Green Party believe that ALL of the town’s treasures should be on display to the public.The relocation of the Museum from its current site risks the eventual loss of one of Southend’s oldest public buildings. We believe that the solution to the current situation lies in two phases:\nThe restoration and expansion of the current Museum, and the construction of the SKIPP Museum in Priory Park.\nSouthend Central Museum has the readily available expansion capability and could be tripled in size without building on any Green Belt land. This expansion of the current facility would result in the ability to put the Museum’s vast collection on permanent display in a modern environment, with ready access to the town’s Public Transport routes.\nThe SKIPP group have been campaigning for a Sutton-Hoo style interactive educational facility on the Brownfield land in Priory Park for years. The SKIPP proposals follow the example of many similar facilities and have consulted the expert advice of many Archaeologists and Historians.\nThe site, which is within walking distance to the over thirty ‘High-Class’ Saxon and Roman Burial sites, would feature authentic replicas of Saxon huts and would house the remains of King Saebert in a secure replica of a Saxon Great Hall.\nThe SKIPP proposal in addition to the expansion of the current museum is the most sustainable and cost-effective solution to the current Museum situation.\nTHE CLIFFSLIP SITE\nThe initial slip happened in January 2001, and after deforestation works were conducted in Prittlwell Square Gardens, this was followed immediately by the major slip on 14th November 2002.\nWhile the council claim that the slip was not directly caused by the removal of many large trees at the top of the Cliff, many locals are abundantly aware of the cause-and-effect nature of the two events. The large trees, which once inhabited the square above the site were planted when the Clifftown area was built in the 1850s. The trees, with their large extensive root network, stabilised the cliffs in two ways:\n- The subterranean root network acted like a piling, which anchored a large part of the upper cliff to the adjacent land.\n- The large volume of water removed by the trees ensured that the Clay was not as susceptible to subsidence.\nThe type of clay that forms the Cliffs is London Clay overlain by Ice Age sand and gravel and river alluvium.\nAccording to a survey conducted by The Essex Field Club, an Essex-based Geology group:\nIn common with London Clay cliffs elsewhere, especially on the Isle of Sheppey on the other side of the estuary, the [Southend] cliffs are susceptible to major landslips. Before the development of Southend in the nineteenth century, this coastline was under constant attack by the sea and would have consisted of tumbled and vegetated slopes with mudflows and large masses of London Clay moving seawards along slip planes lubricated by groundwater.Without trees, London Clay is only naturally stable at an angle of 10 degrees or less.\nSome of Southend’s Cliffs are up to 30 degrees in angle but have a high density of very large old trees with extensive supportive root networks. The proposed site for the ‘Thames Experience’ underwent some major landscaping and structural reinforcement work in 2012. The aim, to stabilise the site from further collapse by piling two rows of steel piles into the ground and creating a retaining wall, has itself come under criticism from SKIPP.\nCiting documents that substantiate their claim, SKIPP argues that the non-newtonian nature of the groundwater-saturated clay itself and the creation of this ‘obstacle’ has only led to an increased pressure load on surrounding areas (principally the Esplanade Pub site), and a subsequent increased risk of further slippage to the east and west of the ‘wall’.\nTHE ESPLANADE SITE.\n(Planning reference 15/01842/FULM)\nAfter the recent Public Consultation for the proposed ‘Clifftown Shore’ site, the Council and local papers were keen to express how popular the plans went down with locals.\nNone of the residents we have spoken to are happy about the current proposals for the Esplanade site.\nIn November 2015, planning permission was sought for the conversion of the former Esplanade Pub site into a five-story building of 23 flats. Conditional Permission was granted by the council in April 2016.\nSince then, the site has been sold to ‘Beyond The Box Property’ who have also acquired the neighbouring Marriotts Fish Bar. Under new plans, 49 apartments will be built across the expanded site in a much larger building comprising twice the number of residential units as was given planning permission for.\nWhile almost all people we’ve spoken with agree that something needs to be done with the eyesore site, most don’t believe that the site should be used for residential homes.\nMany of the arguments against these proposals echo the arguments against the Museum proposals:\n- The high Flood Risk of the site – with particular regard to the underground car parking facility.\n- The Geological instability of the site.\n- The greatly extended height of the building, adding an additional three floors – potentially negatively impacting the sea views of neighbouring residents.\n- Inadequate Parking provision for residents and visitors, forcing them to park on neighbouring roads.\n- Objections to the hyper-modern aesthetic of the proposed building.\nBut there are many concerns with this site that are completely different to the Museum objections.\nInfuriatingly, despite the recent history of the neighbouring plot, the current plans detail the removal of most of the old trees supporting the cliff behind the existing Esplanade Pub.\nThis shocking lack of foresight could potentially threaten the wider stability of the area to the East of the 2002 cliffslip.\nIf a subsequent slip at the Esplanade site occurs similar in scale to the 2002 slip, the beloved funicular Cliff Lift railway could be destroyed, and neighbouring Georgian Clifftown Terrace properties could be affected structurally.\nAnother objection to the proposal from residents is of the nature of 49 properties being created on the seafront.\nThe developers detail a mix of one, two, and three bedroom properties to be created alongside the two restaurants.Many residents and visitors do not believe that this area of the seafront, historically a leisure and business environment, should be open for residential developments of any kind, and are wary that this building – if constructed – could threaten the leisure aspect of the seafront, as well as setting a precedent for future developments.\nMany locals are also angry at the public consultation which some residents were completely unaware of.\nThe Esplanade Pub served the visitors of Southend for over 100 years as both a restaurant and bar.\nTo most, the Esplanade Pub was a well-known local music and entertainment venue.\nMost famously, on Monday 3rd February 1992, the band Pearl Jam played the Esplanade.\nThe Esplanade suffered major structural damage, which led to its eventual closure in late-2016.\nThe structural damage, which most affected the pub’s basement and rear walls, was caused due to the geological movement of the cliffs to the rear of the property.\nTHE OPINION OF RESIDENTS\nWe spoke with many locals at the CSDC Demonstration in Prittlewell Square and all have different concerns.\nWhile most fear the loss of the Green Space on the Cliffs will lead to further seafront development, many also were concerned about the additional strain on local parking provision.\nSome residents were also concerned that the building of these ultra-modern buildings would negatively affect the value of many Clifftown Terrace properties and that the sea view from these houses could be impeded by the several multi-storey buildings and associated screenings.\n“My feeling is that the council is bone dry of money and needs to hawk off the cliffs. We need to understand what’s underpinning this so that we can stop it.”– Julia H. “Hideous, how can they even think this is a good idea!”\n– Christine C. “These plans have most certainly not gone down well with the public. I cannot find a single person in favour of this or the Museum and the proximity to the Conservation Area and serious concerns about this level of development on a cliffside geology should be clear indications of the outrageous nature of these levels of development.\n– Simon C.\nMany residents expressed concerns over the current plans, and most feel completely ignored by the council. After approaching other political parties and councillors for assistance, residents formed the CSDC and turned to the South East Essex Green Party to help, and we were more than happy to assist in this most important of causes.\nThe campaign will continue with local residents’ interests as the central priority. We intend to oppose these developments by running a large-scale petition and letters campaign, and along with our partners at SKIPP, we shall continue to follow this issue attentively.\n“The South East Essex Green Party have been, and always will be, strongly against any development of the Cliffs, especially something of this magnitude where no evidence can be provided to show that it will be cost-effective, culturally sensitive, ecologically and structurally sound, or will actually be a sought-after attraction as Southend Council claims.\nIt is our view that these proposals are another demonstration of Southend Council’s determination to judge their own success by how many “landmark” projects they conceive. We believe that the further continuation of this dead-horse Cliffslip Museum is a total waste of civic funding and time, especially when more economically and environmentally viable alternatives exist.\nWe are also greatly concerned by the Esplanade Pub proposals, and we will continue to support the residents in assuring their concerns are heard and addressed.We strongly reject both of these proposals.”\nWHAT NEXT?\nThere will be a public consultation regarding the Cliffslip Museum when the new architectural drawings are submitted and published. We will be running an awareness and opposition campaign when this happens.\nThe public consultation for the ‘Clifftown Shore’ development has ended, but planning permission is still yet to be granted for the modified drawings. We will be facilitating an opposition campaign when this happens.In the meanwhile, follow the CSDC Facebook page.\nFollowing the recommendation of SKIPP, please also write a letter to the Echo Newspaper and to your Councillors.\nFurther Reading:\nSEEGP Press Release RE Museum.\nSKIPP Press Release RE Museum.\nOther Sources.Beyond The Box: Clifftown Shore\n15/01842/FULM: Clifftown Shore Planning Permission\nAEW Architects: Cliff Museum Planning Letter\nEssex Field Club: Geological Analysis of Southend Cliffs\nImperial College, University of London: Stability of Natural Slopes in London Clay",

Among the postponed items were urgent motions on banning council use of glyphosate herbicides, and a new strategy for protecting the city’s tree canopy.\nCllr Stuart Allen’s proposal seeks to end the use of glyphosate, a cancer-causing herbicide linked to serious health and environmental concerns, on Southend’s streets. Meanwhile, Cllr Richard Longstaff’s motion calls for urgent action to stop unnecessary tree felling, preserve the city’s mature trees, and accelerate tree planting efforts.\nCllr Longstaff, who represents Leigh Ward, voiced his frustration, “Once again, we’re seeing delays in addressing this crucial issue. Mature trees are being lost at an alarming rate, and saplings simply can’t replace them fast enough. At our current rate, it could take 120 years to reach our 17% canopy target. We must act now, planting thousands of trees to protect future generations, particularly as climate change continues to intensify extreme weather and heatwaves that threaten the health and wellbeing of Southend’s residents.”\nCllr Allen added, “I’m eager for my motion to finally be debated. Glyphosate is not just dangerous to wildlife such as butterflies, bees, and other pollinators; it also poses significant risks to human health and pets.

Leigh ward currently has zero public charging points meaning residents who want to make the transition to zero-tailpipe emission vehicles are having to find creative solutions to charge their vehicles, or continue to pump out toxic fumes from burning petrol or diesel.\n“Car companies are now mandated to sell 22% of their vehicles as electric powered, this increases to 100% in just a few years. Instead of getting solutions installed now, we are sitting on our hands. We could be installing hundreds of ‘trickle’ chargers through the city by using our existing street lighting columns tomorrow. That alone would help many of our residents who are not privileged enough to have a driveway.”\n“Whilst I always prefer to cycle or walk, there are reasons why people need use of a car, and we, as a Council, should be harnessing the grants that have been available to provide solutions that make it easy for residents to make the switch to electric, instead of pumping out all sorts of pollutants into the air. While I welcome talk of action from the leader, I’m disappointed that the administration seems to be in no rush to find a solution until almost 2026, by which time a third of new cars sold will have to be electric.”\nCllr Stuart Allen\nFellow Green Councillor Richard Longstaff continues, “It’s ridiculous that we still don’t have a single public charger in Leigh ward for residents to use. I first approached the Council about finding a solution 7 years ago. There are tried and tested solutions out there that can be used today, such as lamppost charging or pavement gullies. Many London boroughs have at least lamppost charging in place, earning revenue for the council and providing a solution to residents charging on-street.”\nThe Green Party continues its push to ensure there is adequate and reliable charging infrastructure in Southend.\n– ENDS –",

I would also like to thank you for sharing the fact sheet with me.\nOn climate action, I agree with you on the gravity of the situation. Last year was the hottest on record, the first to pass 1.5°C above the pre-industrial average. This should be an alarm call for all of us.\nI therefore welcome that since coming to office, the Government has already introduced a world-leading agenda on climate and nature action, making rapid progress and overturning the legacy of the previous Government, which left the country, as the Climate Change Committee confirmed last July, off track to meet our climate goals.\nI welcome, for example, the Government’s ambitious mission to make Britain a clean energy superpower – delivering clean power by 2030 and accelerating to net zero across the economy. And I back the crucial steps it has already taken towards getting us back on course, including removing the ban on onshore wind in England, committing over £20 billion for carbon capture, approving solar projects that will be able to power millions of homes, launching Great British Energy and delivering a record-breaking renewables auction. I also support the plans it has set out for increasing the energy efficiency of rented homes to lift up to half a million households out of fuel poverty.\nOn Heathrow, I understand the concerns that many people have about the expansion of airports and their compatibility with our climate change targets. So I am pleased that the Government has been clear that any airport expansion proposals will need to demonstrate they can be delivered in line with our legally binding climate change commitments, as well as meeting strict air quality standards.\nI am pleased that progress is already being made in transitioning to greener aviation with the introduction of the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) mandate which is now in force. In support of this, the Government will invest £63 million over the next year in the advanced fuels fund, supporting SAF producers across the UK. Ministers have been clear that the Government’s SAF commitments will support thousands of jobs while bringing down our transport emissions.\nAs for Southend Airport I do not believe there are any plans to expand the current flights operations.\nI believe the benefits to the South-east through the Lower Thames Crossing will be profound. This project is expected to almost double road capacity across the Thames east of London, significantly easing congestion at the Dartford Crossing and improving journey times by up to 46% between Tilbury and Medway. It will also create a more resilient road network, reducing traffic spill over onto local roads and providing a vital new route for freight, connecting South-East ports with manufacturing centres and distribution hubs. Additionally, the project is projected to add up to £40 billion to the UK economy by making journeys quicker, safer, and more reliable. I support my fellow parliamentary peers in the South East with their efforts in progressing the proposed development forward, as it will bring substantial economic and logistical benefits to our region.\nThank you once again for contacting me about this important issue. I can assure you that I will continue to support the strong action that we need on climate change.",

Several roads across Southend, particularly Leigh, have seen the council’s yellow Tree Removal Notices being stapled to perfectly-healthy trees, earmarking them for imminent destruction.\nConcerned residents have contacted the Green Party following the arrival of the notices, with many residents rightly questioning on what grounds the trees are being removed. Upon investigation, the council has used the blanket justification of “incompatible with highways works” for almost every planned removal; admitting by default that the trees are otherwise perfectly healthy.\nThe Green Party disputes the Council’s claim that the trees are unavoidably required for removal and are incompatible with footway standards. Many examples already exist across the city that demonstrate that mature street trees can be accommodated as part of an accessible standards-compliant pavement. The council is choosing to continue its terrible record of removing perfectly healthy trees and is subjecting residents to worsening air quality and dwindling wildlife as a direct result.\nIt is our view that these trees are being earmarked for destruction as a consequence of the council’s poor management and due to zero oversight or scrutiny of the tree removal process. We again face a situation whereby the council is stripping out our irreplaceable natural assets at a time of climate crisis due to poor oversight and an evident lack of due process, education, and imagination.\nPhil Barwell, who is a senior Arboricultural Officer in London said in a statement to the Once Upon A Tree group:\n“This approach to urban tree management is outdated and ill-informed. There is guidance available on alternative engineering solutions that can be implemented on the public highway prior to considering tree removal including footway buildout, Flexipave or Addaflex installation, and tree pit enlargement.\nPil Barwell\nIt is a political choice to support the removal of trees in respect of minor footway damage when there are suitable engineering solutions available to retain trees with the urban environment.”\nGreen Party candidate for Leigh, Richard Longstaff said:\n“I understand that there is currently no director of highways, meaning there is a vacuum in leadership just as Leigh-on-Sea is having significant pavement works. This is leading to an unusually high number of perfectly-healthy street trees being removed for no other reason than arbitrary and unchecked highways dept. decisions. It shows negligence and a breakdown of leadership and management of the teams responsible for our Street Trees, from both executives and elected council members.\nRichard Longstaff\nI would like an urgent meeting with senior management and executives at the council to outline how they will take immediate action and to reassure city residents that our street trees are safe and in good management with the appropriate ISO quality assurance, and external auditing of the teams that oversee the implementation of the council’s tree policy and processes.”\nThe Green Party have demanded an immediate meeting with the Council to highlight the serious issues of their record of unnecessary and reckless tree removal. We urgently call on Southend-on-Sea City Council and Cllr Carole Mulroney, in her position as deputy leader, to again enact a moratorium on all tree felling until this situation is reviewed and a new director of highways appointed to oversee the teams on the ground.\nENDS",

Lauren believes the city must adopt a proactive approach to prevent further degradation and is asking a question at full council on Thursday 20th March.\n“Some verges are in a terrible state,” Lauren said. “While enforcement through byelaws and fines is an option, I believe it’s far better to design solutions that prevent this from happening in the first place. Canvey Road in West Leigh provides an excellent example – planting bushes not only deters vehicles but also enhances biodiversity.”\nCllr. Stuart Allen, Councillor for Leigh Ward echoed Lauren’s concerns, noting that the problem extends beyond verges.\n“It’s not just the grass – our entire infrastructure is suffering,” Cllr. Allen said. “Signs are being bent and twisted, bollards are being knocked down, and all of this comes at a significant cost to taxpayers. We need to explore solutions, whether through better urban design or a delivery licensing scheme to help offset these expenses.”\nThe Green Party continues to advocate for policies that promote sustainability, improve public spaces, and foster biodiversity, emphasising that well-maintained infrastructure benefits both residents and the environment.\n– ENDS –\nNotes to editor:\nLauren Ekins question to Cllr Daniel Cowen states;\nAcross the city, our grass verges are being damaged by residents driving across them and delivery drivers using them for parking. Once well-maintained green spaces are now frequently reduced to muddy, unsightly, hazardous areas. The most effective long-term solution would be to design out the problem while also enhancing biodiversity. Streets such as Canvey Road in Leigh demonstrate how a mix of trees and shrubs on these verges can improve both the street scene and local wildlife.\nI am concerned about the approach taken in some areas where verges have been tarmacked over, I do not believe this is a viable solution. It decreases capacity for natural drainage and encourages parking on walkways, to name just a few drawbacks. Will the portfolio holder explore ways to protect and enhance our verges, ensuring they contribute positively to both residents’ wellbeing and the local environment?",

Greens argue that this is short-sighted and flawed. A second crossing would do nothing to tackle congestion in the long term, as it will fuel further increases in traffic, known as ‘induced traffic’ (2).\nHighways England claim that the tunnel will bring economic benefits to the Southern and Eastern regions and that it will help to reduce congestion at the current Dartford crossing. Greens argue that this is short-sighted and flawed. A second crossing would do nothing to tackle congestion in the long term, as it will fuel further increases in traffic, known as ‘induced traffic’ (2).\nGreens are also highly concerned about the wider impact new roads and a tunnel will have on local residents and the environment. Thurrock has already been identified in a World Health Organisation report for breaching safe levels of air pollution (3). Greens believe a new crossing will not alleviate pollution in South Essex in general and will bring heightened pollution to residents along the route corridor, on both sides of the Thames.\nGreens want to see measures put in place to tackle air and noise pollution, rather than endlessly extending road networks. Greens are highlighting that the billions of pounds spent on this development could be better invested in measures which would reduce pollution and tackle the urgent issue of climate change. Greens are calling for investment in rail networks to make them fit for purpose, allowing people and freight to move in a more sustainable, less polluting way (4).\nLeader of the Green Group on Essex County Council, Councillor James Abbott, said:\n“South Essex has some of the highest air pollution levels in the country, and developing further road networks does nothing to counter this. With air pollution in the county responsible for ill health and early deaths every year, it’s time to stop pouring money into more roads. We need cleaner, sustainable travel options that move people and freight more efficiently and without causing so much pollution.\nThe new tunnel will be connected up with yet more new roads cutting through the countryside – and it is likely that further countryside will be lost to development linked to the new roads – particularly near the new junctions.”\nThe Green Party’s national transport spokesperson, Caroline Russell, said:\n“Instead of building more roads and encouraging more people to travel by car, we need policies which are fit for the 21st century. Our Government just participated in securing a global deal to tackle climate change – in light of this commitment, our obsession with carbon-intensive travel has to end.”\nGreens are urging concerned residents to respond to the consultation.\nNotes:\n- https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-tunnel-proposed-for-lower-thames-crossing-8-week-consultation-launches-today\n- http://www.bettertransport.org.uk/roads-nowhere/induced-traffic\n- http://www.thurrockgazette.co.uk/news/11206331.Thurrock __named_and_shamed__by_WHO_over_pollution_stats/\n- Green MP Caroline Lucas’s Railways Bill calls for the railways to be brought back into public hands, to improve investment in our rails and to ensure affordability and access: http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2015-16/railways.html",

In 2015 we were able to field four constituency candidates. This being the first time we stood in Castle Point and Rayleigh & Wickford our share of the vote was again low, but better than the 2010 results elsewhere.

Voters in Southend will be given the opportunity to choose a new direction for our community, our city, and our country. Southend residents can see how the Conservatives take their vote for granted here, and they don’t feel any better off after fourteen years of Conservative government. The offer from Starmer’s Labour is particularly uninspiring too. Voters know what the Green Party stands for. Every vote for the Green Party in this election sends a strong message to the next Labour government that people want forward-thinking and innovative action on the crises our country faces. The Greens have a transformative and hopeful vision of what our country can be; a fairer and greener society, where people have financial and energy security, where people can lead happier and healthier lives in a good quality and affordable home, and where the reality of the climate emergency is given the urgent attention it needs.\nHaving been a candidate in my home ward St. Lukes for the last three local elections, I am honoured to represent my constituency in the upcoming General Election.\nI stand for building strong, connected communities across the City of Southend and beyond, and I have a proven track record of facilitating change towards community connection, both through vocational and voluntary activities. We need happy and healthy communities, where residents not only have all their basic needs met but also find connection. This creates an environment where people will feel less isolated, feel safer in their local area and foster inclusivity for marginalised people. If this was not enough, connected communities also represent substantial economic benefits, according to The Cost of Disconnected Communities Report (Centre for Economics and Business Research, 2017).\nLooking at the bigger picture of the climate breakdown, a society of happy, healthy and well-educated citizens will aid the transition to decarbonisation and a healthy planet. Creating strong communities to promote the transition towards decarbonisation on an individual level must always come hand in hand with robust policy at a national level.\nAs an active Green Party member, but also as an educated citizen and, last but definitely not least, a mother, aunt and facilitator of activities for and with young people, I have long been very concerned about the future we are building for the generations to come.\nOur current administration is incapable of delivering the change we need due to severe personal conflicts of interest.\nIn line with the UN Sustainable Development Goals, I stand for the decarbonisation of industries. This includes appropriate taxation and regulation of industries creating carbon, such as energy providers, air travel, and agriculture, to name just a few. On the other hand, I support circular economies, active travel as well as a solid and affordable train network, investment into green jobs, regenerative power and farming based on permaculture principles.\nI support the renationalisation of public services. Every citizen has a right to free or very affordable access to education, healthcare, public transport, warm homes and clean water.\nHere in the City as well as across the country, we can clearly see the failure of the current system of privatisation in the continuing sewage contamination of our waterways following the ongoing lack of investment in the infrastructure. Our current administration is unable to resolve this issue.\nI stand for equality among people. On a national level, this means the introduction of a Universal Basic Income scheme as well as legislation in support of marginalised groups of people. Beyond this, it includes immigration laws rooted in kindness and safe routes into the country for refugees coming from areas threatened by oppression, war and environmental catastrophes due to climate breakdown.\nReferring to one of my heroes, Kate Raworth, and her theory of Doughnut Economics: I strive for a world where all people live inside the doughnut – a world where all basic needs are met for everyone, while our use of resources remains within the planetary boundaries.\nLatest News\n- Big Summer SocialJoin the Southend Green Party for our Big Summer Social!\n- Green Councillors stand up against the proposed Bournes Green DevelopmentAt Wednesday’s Extraordinary Full Council Meeting, the Green Group on Southend City Council made their position unmistakably clear regarding a motion brought to Council.

For context, the National Urban Tree Cover average is 17%.\nThis new dangerously-unambitious policy aims to achieve a measly 3.05% increase to just 15% by 2050, which equates to just a 1% increase per decade.\nIn a time of Climate Emergency, this is simply not good enough.\n| Southend Council Ward | 2019 % Canopy Cover |\n| Belfairs Park Ward | 23.3% |\n| Blenheim Park Ward | 12.7% |\n| Chalkwell Ward | 12.0% |\n| Eastwood Park Ward | 12.0% |\n| Kursaal Ward | 9.4% |\n| Leigh Ward | 9.7% |\n| Milton Ward | 10.0% |\n| Prittlewell Ward | 14.4% |\n| Southchurch Ward | 11.0% |\n| Shoeburyness Ward | 12.3% |\n| St Laurence Ward | 10.0% |\n| St Luke’s Ward | 12.7% |\n| Thorpe Ward | 13.1% |\n| Westborough Ward | 8.5% |\n| West Leigh Ward | 14.4% |\n| West Shoebury Ward | 8.6% |\n| Victoria Ward | 9.0% |\n| Borough of Southend (Average) | 11.95% |\nTree Canopy Cover Report by Ward (Southend Borough Council, October 2019)\nPlanting trees is one of the easiest ways of tackling the Climate Emergency.\nSouthend Council’s own draft policy lists the many vital ways in which Trees benefit residents:\n“Trees play an important role within an urban environment. There has been extensive research in recent years demonstrating the significant benefits trees bring to our physical and mental health, our social and economic wellbeing, to biodiversity, to the air we breathe, and the soil beneath our feet. They help offset the effects of heavy rainfall, helping to mitigate flood risk, and offset the urban heat island effect. They capture and store carbon and particulates which pose an increasing risk to human health.“\nAnd yet, in this policy Southend Council seeks to achieve the minutest of incremental increases in the number of trees within the borough over a ridiculously unambitious timeframe, seemingly contradicting its declaration of a Climate Emergency in 2019.\nWhy then, when it comes to planting trees – possibly one of the easiest, most cost-effective, and publically popular options available, is the Council so unenthusiastic and lacklustre?\nIn recent months, Southend Council has partially relied on supporting community groups such as Once Upon A Tree (Southend), who use charitable donations to buy saplings and whips and plant them in the town’s public parks. Volunteers have also aided the council in planting new whips in parks.\nWhilst these community endeavours are to be commended, the real change needs to be in the council’s own planning priorities and culture which remain structurally unecological.\nSo, what options are available to Southend Council?\nThere are many easily-deliverable initiatives that would yield much higher canopy coverage in a much shorter timeframe, a necessity in view of impending ecological collapse, but such ideas would seem ‘unthinkable’ to a majority of existing Councillors and officers. Initiatives such as;\n- Protecting agricultural and green land at Fossetts Farm, Shoebury North, and Shoebury Garrison from destructive housebuilding, and instead, using the space to ‘re-afforest’ the land creating three new large woodland parks;\n- Creating new micro “Pocket Parks” on the abundance of vacant land across the borough;\n- Committing to planting street trees as part of wide-ranging ‘mini-Holland’ style traffic management systems;\n- Investigating a proportional reduction in on-street parking and car parks to facilitate new parks, allotments, and green spaces;\n- Implementing mandatory quotas for green spaces and community planting in new large brownfield housing and commercial developments, such as the Queensway and Seaway schemes;\nThese are just a few of the many available options the council could implement to achieve a much higher tree canopy cover across Southend. All of these schemes would (alongside major investment in public transport) deliver better air quality, better mental health, less traffic, improved flood management, and significantly higher carbon sequestration.\nThe South East Essex Green Party commits to delivering all of these schemes in Southend, alongside the many other transformative proposals outlined in our Manifesto.\nNationally, The Green Party aims to plant 700 million trees by 2030, as part of our radical vision for a cleaner and greener future.\nFurther Reading:\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/04/planting-billions-trees-best-tackle-climate-crisis-scientists-canopy-emissions",

  "https_southeastessex_greenparty_org_uk_/https_southeastessex_greenparty_org_uk_news_2018_10_18_residents-win-campaign-against-cliffslip-museum/content_227.html": "On 18/10/2018, Southend Borough Council finally SCRAPPED their ridiculous plans for a £55M Museum on Green Belt land.\nIn December last year, we stood with over 50 concerned residents and rallied in Prittlewell Square to demand the council take notice that the residents of the area did not want the proposed Cliffslip Developments, namely the plans to convert the existing Esplanade Pub site into 23 luxury flats and to build a £55m museum on geologically unstable green-belt ground.\nSince then, the campaign has rumbled on slowly gaining more public awareness and support.\nIn late September, the local Green Party began remobilising the efforts against the museum plans after a Freedom of Information request by a local resident found that the proposed developments would cost £55Million.\nShortly afterwards we issued a statement and announced a Public Meeting to organise the several campaign groups into one unified force and plan a series of protests.\nJust days before the proposed Public Meeting was due to take place, the council announced with no warning that they had decided to drop the plans in it’s entirety, with Cllr Slater stating at the Council Meeting of 18/10/2018 that the scheme was “not feasible, not viable, and not going to happen.”\n“We welcome the decision from Southend Borough Council to drop the plans, but we condemn the Council for bringing the decade-old dead-horse idea back in the first place. The council has already spent far too much public money drafting several sets of architectural drawings for a Museum no-one wants.”\nAs the only political party in Southend opposed to these ridiculous schemes, the Green Party is once again proud to have stood with Saxon King In Priory Park and the Stop the Cliff Development residents’ group in standing up to the council and eventually winning against these proposed developments.\nHOWEVER, we cannot be complacent…\nWhile Southend Council has finally admitted that the Cliffs is not going to be the location for their “Thames Estuary Experience” Museum, it has not ruled out what will happen to the Cliff Gardens site.\nIn a recent Echo article an unidentified ‘spokesman’ for Southend Borough Council said;\n“In terms of the future of the site, it has potential for other development, which could include residential, parking or other mixed use. The site as a whole might require some longer term work on cliff stabilisation if no other development takes place. Were any future plans for a town-centre museum to come forward, parking would have to be factored into those plans.”\nAdding that the work already carried out to the Cliffs;\n“… was completed three years ago within the budget. It was required with or without a museum coming forward and is expected to provide medium-term protection against cliff slippage for around 25 years. It will be regularly monitored to ensure that it is performing adequately, much in the same way we do with sea defences.”\nThe part that concerns us here is the suggestion that the proposed site could be handed over to property developers for residential development.\nThe inference that the site could in some way now be used for residential homes is a slap in the face of those who have campaigned so hard for so long against the development of the Cliffs. The council seems to have completely misunderstood the concerns of the local residents; it wasn’t just specifically the museum we object to, but rather the notion that a much-loved piece of historically-significant Green Space could be developed on.\nSeemingly in an effort to retain the equally-contentious Car Parking element of the proposals, the Council now seem keen to outwardly alleviate the worries of the people of Southend, while back-handedly proposing this site be retained for future residential development.\nThis is of course without mentioning the fact that the site is also a High-Risk flood environment, and that any subterranean carpark will flood like clockwork every year, even before considering the expected sea-level rise because of Climate Change.\n“We are appalled that despite acknowledging that the Cliffs are not a suitable place to build a Museum, Southend Council seem so blindly preoccupied with the concept of building on the site that they are considering opening up the land to residential development.\nGreen Space in Southend is such a scarce resource as it is, and we do not need any more developments threatening to set the precedent that building on public land is in any way okay.\nWe emphatically oppose any and all development on the Southend Cliffs, residential, commercial or otherwise.“\nThe Conservative administration have also been hinting heavily towards their intention to use an empty retail unit in the High Street to locate their new Museum, which has drawn criticism from SKIPP.\nWith more town-centre businesses closing every month, our High Street is seriously struggling and looking more and more like a Ghost town every day.\nEarlier this year, the council controversially scrapped one-hour parking in the Town Centre in a bid to generate £700K, and brought in new electronic signs diverting tourists to car parks many miles from the High Street. These measures in combination with harsher business rates have proved tough for many High Street retailers, and many town-centre businesses have been feeling the strain with a few recognisable stores closing for good.\nWe wonder why it is now that the Council are considering ‘diversification’ of the High Street as a good idea.\n“We do not believe that the High Street is an appropriate location for the proposed Museum, and the Conservative plans to ‘diversify’ the already-struggling High Street seems to us to be a last-ditch effort to draw attention away from the fact that local businesses are struggling.\nWe call on the council to adequately listen to local businesses, and sufficiently address their concerns.”\nBut what about the Museum..?\nSouthend Council argues that many of the Town’s collections of relics and historic artefacts – including the Saxon King Saebert, and the wreckage of the HMS London – have been kept in storage due to the space limitations at the relatively small current site.\nWe believe that the solution to the current Museum situation lies in two phases:\nThe restoration and expansion of the current Museum, and the construction of the SKIPP Museum in Priory Park.\nSouthend Central Museum has the readily available expansion capability and could be tripled in size without building on any Green Belt land. This expansion of the current facility would result in the ability to put the Museum’s vast collection on permanent display in a modern environment, with ready access to the town’s Public Transport routes.\nAny relocation of the Museum from its current site risks the eventual loss of one of Southend’s oldest public buildings, which is something we cannot support.\nWe believe strongly that the SKIPP proposals offer the town the best way of displaying the historically-significant remains of King Saebert in a purpose-built facility in Priory Park.\nThe SKIPP group have been campaigning for a Sutton-Hoo style interactive educational facility on the Brownfield land in Priory Park for years. The SKIPP proposals follow the example of many similar facilities and have consulted the expert advice of many Archaeologists and Historians.\nThe site, which is within walking distance to the over thirty ‘High-Class’ Saxon and Roman Burial sites, would feature authentic replicas of Saxon huts and would house the remains of King Saebert in a secure replica of a Saxon Great Hall.\nThe SKIPP proposal in addition to the expansion of the current museum is the most sustainable and cost-effective solution to the current issue of housing the remains.\nWHAT NEXT?\nThe South East Essex Green Party will continue to monitor this issue, and the campaign will continue with local residents’ interests as the central priority. We will not be satisfied until the Southend Cliffs are granted unequivocal protection from residential or commercial development.\nWe will continue to raise awareness of this issue, and we remain just as strongly against any further development of the Southend Cliffs.\nFollowing the recommendation of SKIPP, please also write a letter to the Echo Newspaper and to your Councillors supporting the SKIPP proposals.",

His focus: upgrading bus stops, improving signage, and accelerating the shift toward electric buses.\n“If we’re going to reduce the strain on our at-capacity infrastructure, we need to be encouraging people to use the bus more,” Simon said. “Right now, buses are competing against each other, shelters are in disrepair, and signage is often non-existent, making it incredibly difficult for people to even know where the routes run.”\nMr Gittus is calling for what he describes as “London-style” bus stop signage, with clearly marked routes, journey times, and maps – an upgrade he argues is long overdue.\nCllr Richard Longstaff, Green Party Councillor for Leigh Ward, agreed, “In so many cities around Europe people rely on the bus to get around instead of using their cars. It’s about time we change the narrative here in Southend and make buses as accessible to as many people as possible so that anyone and everyone can rely on our bus services.”\nHis push comes amid recent fare hikes by the Labour government, a move that has drawn criticism from the Green Party. With rising costs making public transport less attractive, The Greens are hoping that – at the very least – basic infrastructure improvements can be fast-tracked.\n– ENDS –\nSimon Gittus will be asking Cllr Paul Collins at the Full Council meeting on the 20th February the following:\nI welcome the proposed investment in our struggling bus network, a long-overdue step toward improving public transport in our communities. Could the portfolio holder clarify how the £1.8 million in capital funding will be allocated? Will this investment include essential upgrades such as a transition to electric vehicles, clearer and more comprehensive signage to help passengers navigate routes with ease, and well-designed green-roofed shelters that offer genuine protection from the elements and support biodiversity? These measures would not only enhance the user experience but also encourage greater uptake of public transport at a time when sustainable travel has never been more important.\nSimon can be followed on Social Media at simongittus.green on Facebook and Instagram.",

A billion people living in the third world living on less than a pound a day. Whole communities that have no jobs and no access to water. I have held babies that are half the size they should be that are prescribed emergency medicine to try to stabilise them. I have seen people on camps little more than a bag of bones.”\n“By definition, any measure that is relative will include people that are not within the measure – that is the nature of relative measures. We should be more careful how we use these words.”\nIt has become very clear that local MP James Duddridge is completely out of touch with the community he so often fails to represent; blindly supporting every cut and poverty-inducing measure introduced by his Conservative government.\nHis failure to recognise real poverty in Southend is simply down to his lack of understanding of the town’s issues, and what drives them.\nWe’ve done some Homework for Mr Duddridge, and hopefully, he’ll see this.\nSouthend has an average weekly income of £413 per week, £126 below the national average of £539 per week.\nFor comparison, Doncaster (with a comparable population) earns £473 per week.\nThe average monthly rent in Southend is £895, compared to just £517 in Doncaster.\nIn Southend, the average house price is £303,493, compared to just £158,887 in Doncaster.\nWhile we’re all considering moving to Doncaster, remember that Doncaster also falls in the bottom 15 of the lowest paid towns in the UK alongside Southend. Doncaster is by no means doing well, yet it’s staggering to see how far behind we truly are.\nThe issue is not just nationwide, it’s very, very specific.\nCall it what you will Mr Duddridge; Southend is being left behind.\nThe Joseph Rowntree Foundation, the UK’s Poverty charity, defines UK-relative poverty as:\n“When a person’s resources (mainly their material resources) are not sufficient to meet their minimum needs (including social participation).”\nBased on the above information combined with;\n- the very-visible nature of the hardships felt in a town with the highest number of Homeless people in Essex,\n- a housing crisis compounded by the fact that fewer than 40 social rent homes have been built by Southend Council in the last 12 months,\n- and the food bank statistics suggesting that donations are struggling to keep up with demand, and last-resort community services are crumbling,\nI think we can say with some confidence that there are very high levels of poverty in our town, despite what our glorious MP says.\nNobody would argue that poverty is not relative.\nTo simply dismiss the real crisis many families in our towns and cities face –families having to choose between eating and heating and children suffering malnutrition – purely because you take issue with what to call it, then I’m afraid we’ve got an issue.\nIf you don’t think poverty exists in Southend, then I’d kindly suggest you walk through the streets of Southend and speak to the poorest families that I speak to every week.\nThese statistics are not an invention.\nThe issues we in our town and across the UK see owe their existence in large part to the ongoing policies of the current Conservative Government;\n- Promoting underemployment and low pay,\n- Constantly cutting budgets for the NHS and other essential community services,\n- Introducing the complete failure that is Universal Credit,\n- And furthering the devastating ideological policies of austerity which were never necessary.\nIt is pretty clear that Mr Duddridge, who has unerringly and consistently voted in favour of every single measure which has resulted in this situation, is fully aware of the way in which the poorest have been forced to pick up the bill for government profligacy.\nHis pompous indignation should be the final straw for the people of Southend whom he has never lifted a finger in support of.\nIt is not incumbent on elected public servants to use lies and misrepresentation to push personal ideologies. When presented with FACTS as stark as these I would fully expect a representative to either roll their sleeves up and work for the people to help bring about a solution, or to admit their faults and stand aside.\nEND STATEMENT\nFurther Reading:\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/22/social-deprivation-its-not-parents-but-poverty\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-46236642",

  "https_southeastessex_greenparty_org_uk_/https_southeastessex_greenparty_org_uk_news_2018_11_17_green-party-against-lower-thames-crossing/content_208.html": "Today, Saturday 17th November 2018, the Eastern Region Green Party, including Councillor James Abbott and members of the Essex Green Parties, voted unanimously to oppose the proposal for a new crossing of the Thames by road.\nThe controversial £6BILLION Lower Thames Crossing (also called the third crossing,) is to be the “biggest road project since M25“, consisting of a 23km long three-lane toll road connecting the M2 near Rochester and the M25 in Essex via a 3.8km tunnel between Gravesend and Tilbury.\nMeeting in Norwich for the Eastern Region Green Party AGM, representatives from the Colchester & North Essex, Brentwood & Chelmsford, Witham & Braintree, and South East Essex Green Parties joined Essex Councillor James Abbott in condemning the proposals.\nThe meeting voted unanimously that the Eastern Region Green Party could not support the proposals in its current form due to the following three considerations which it believes are inexcusable:\n1. The road would create a considerable increase in additional CO2 emissions from vehicles.\nClimate Change is the most important issue of our time.\nIt is no surprise to anyone that more traffic equals more CO2 emissions.\nSome of the world’s leading climate scientists all agree that our carbon-intensive ways and reliance on fossil fuels is leading to soaring global temperatures and more extreme weather events. It is now more than ever that we desperately need to be tackling our deep-rooted obsession with oil and gas, and building new roads is in no way going to help that issue.\nJenny Bates from the environmental group Friends of the Earth said:\n“It’s astonishing that in the week the UN is warning of the need for urgent action to avoid catastrophic climate change, the UK government is boasting about building more roads. This road development will only encourage more cars, vans, lorries and traffic, pumping more air pollution and climate-damaging emissions into our environment. Politicians need to take their foot off the accelerator in order to protect the planet.”\nAs part of our Paris Climate Agreement commitments, the UK has to start taking drastic action with regard to our CO2 emissions if we are to adequately address the existential threat we face.\nBuilding a new road across the Thames does not help that.\n2. The road would create additional Nitrous Oxides, Particulates, and other polluting emissions.\nA recent study into Air Quality has already named four towns in South Essex as amongst the UK’s worst for Air Pollution, exceeding the World Health Organisation limits;\nThurrock: 14 microgrammes per cubic metre.\nGrays: 12 microgrammes per cubic metre.\nSouthend-On-Sea: 11 microgrammes per cubic metre.\nStanford-le-Hope: 10 microgrammes per cubic metre.\nFor reference, the World Health Organisation safe Air Pollution Limit is 10 microgrammes per cubic metre.\nBeyond that 10 microgrammes per cubic metre limit, people are far more likely to develop long-lasting and pervasive health conditions. An estimated 4.2 million premature deaths globally are linked to Ambient Air Pollution, mainly from heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer, and acute respiratory infections in children.\nAnother congested Thames Crossing would only exacerbate the issue of Air Pollutants in South Essex and could lead to a large increase of pollution-related health issues in neighbouring towns.\n3. The Destruction of the Green Belt land, wildlife, and biodiversity.\nWith such a massive infrastructure project, many environmentalists have pointed to the irreparable damage the scheme would have to wildlife and surrounding natural areas.\nThe Highways England consultation documents admit that;\n“Our proposed scheme would have an impact on local communities as well as cultural heritage and landscape. These include areas of greenbelt, the Kent Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and areas of ancient woodland”. They go on to say “All route options would potentially affect areas of ancient woodland and protected species such as water voles, great crested newts and birds.”\nThe destruction seen in such a project would be inexcusable. The loss of green belt land through five ancient woodlands, protected areas designated as Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and the permanent effect it would have on our natural world and its ecosystems and wildlife has not been considered.\nThere is no offset or impact-reduction measure that the road builders could employ that would stop the felling of large swathes of ancient woodland.\nThere is no route change that could possibly stop the complete destruction of thousands of separate ecosystems home to hundreds of species of wildlife.\nWho thinks it’s a good idea then?\nThe Campaign for Better Transport described the scheme as “bad value” and likely to shift Dartford’s congestion and pollution problems downstream, saying that “practical alternatives are available, at a fraction of the financial and environmental cost”.\nLeaders of rival political groups on Thurrock Council have united to condemn the plans, with the Council Leader calling it “the worst choice out of a terrible bunch” while opposition leader Cllr John Kent summed up widely-shared views:\n“We don’t want our green belt destroyed and we don’t want our homes destroyed. We don’t want an ill-thought through scheme thrust upon us and the country as a whole. And most of all, we don’t want the queues, congestion, and pollution shifted five miles downstream as a new motorway cuts our borough in half.”\nThe Woodland Trust said the scheme would cause “irreversable damage” to surrounding woodland.\nLocal Residents’ Action Groups have formed to oppose the plans, and a significant amount of residents do not want to see the proposed crossing happen.\nI think it’s safe to say that it’s not a popular proposal.\n“The South East Essex Green Party are pleased to join other Essex Green Parties in securing this motion against the planned Lower Thames Crossing.\nIn our view the Lower Thames Crossing will cost us more in ecological destruction than could ever be gained elsewhere. The route will not alleviate congestion, rather, it will reroute it shifting the issue onto areas of Essex that did not, and do not ask for it.\nThe scheme would be an expensive and destructive blot on our landscape, and would worsen Air Quality and CO2 emissions, threatening the quality of life for most of South Essex’s residents.”\nFurther Reading:\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-45799384\nhttps://www.thurrockindependent.com/2018/05/02/thurrock-is-among-uks-worst-for-air-pollution/\nhttps://www.who.int/airpollution/ambient/health-impacts/en/\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/10/revised-plans-for-thames-crossing-attract-controversy",

While we viewed the motion as politically motivated, our Green Councillors delivered powerful and heartfelt speeches opposing any development on Bournes Green.\nThe Green Group had submitted an amendment to ensure that this land would never be built on, but was rejected.\nCllr Richard Longstaff, Green Group Leader said;\nNationally, the Green Party strongly opposes to building on metropolitan greenbelt land, which exists for a reason to prevent urban sprawl, protect nature and support mental and physical wellbeing through access to green spaces.\nWe’re also against administrative impropriety, where council is bypassed by any administration and council officers in making applications to government without full council debate. We’ve already voted against this as a council. I said very clearly last year how local government is based on democratic principles. This, again, doesn’t feel very democratic. Our residents deserve better. Bournes Green lightly serves as a valuable, ecological and community resource. Once built on its environmental and social value, cannot be recovered.\nAlternatives exist. Southend, like many other urban areas, has underutilised brownfield sites, empty homes, and outdated commercial buildings that can be repurposed as repurposed or refitted as we seeing on on a yearly basis as the population grows. Prioritising urban regeneration and retrofitting high quality infill housing aligns with sustainable planning principles.\nThis type of proposal should be mastermind by planning and urban design professionals, not politicians and council officers. Southend is a peninsula of land the size of Manhattan. Is constrained on the north by greenbelt and at the south by history. It’s fairly unique. It is not Cambridge, Chelmsford or Colchester. It can’t expand in all directions. It needs a joined up masterplan to deal with sustainable growth.\nClimate commitments in developing greenbelt land is inconsistent with local and national planning policy and environmental goals. Such development represents urban sprawl, which increases car dependency, harms biodiversity, releases stored carbon from soils and vegetation. It also risks food security for communities in the event of a food supply chain issue have we’ve seen recently, in recent years. In times of continued instability, with 55% of our food imported, we as a council, need to think very carefully about our development plans and future food security. This land is agricultural land.\nAffordable housing shouldn’t be a Trojan horse. While housing needs is urgent, particularly for genuinely affordable homes, developers often use this argument to justify building executive homes on greenbelt land that represents urban sprawl and creates car dependency.\nYou can’t build infrastructure on a constrained city like Southend. Moving people through cities is what makes cities function. We can’t build an M11 to London. This is not the way to plan sustainable development. We believe we should be focusing on community led housing, co-operatives and council led affordable homes in existing urban areas instead. This needs a joined up approach with a more robust, forward thinking plan for growth.\nCllr Stuart Allen added;\nI speak tonight not just as a councillor, but as someone who cares deeply about the future of our communities and our environment. Let me be clear: the Green Party had no part in the decisions around Bournes Green. We were elected in 2023. We weren’t in the cabinet. We didn’t vote for this and we won’t defend it.\nWhat we have done is consistently oppose building on green-belt land. Bournes Green is not brownfield. It’s agricultural land, a vital green buffer between Southend and Rochford. Now we face plans for up to 10,000 homes. Let’s be honest, this motion has more to do with political point-scoring than protecting the land. And residents deserve better.\nThis kind of development risks turning Southend into a featureless sprawl. We’ve seen it before — unaffordable homes, watered-down social housing, and estates with no shops, no schools, no services. Meanwhile, over a million homes nationwide already have planning permission but haven’t been built. Thousands are empty – including here in Southend. We don’t need to build over our last green spaces to meet Local demand.\nWith climate change accelerating, land like Bournes Green could help feed our city. Once it’s lost, it’s lost forever. Neither the motion nor the amendment guarantees protection for this land. Had our amendment been accepted, it would have.\nBut I ask this chamber: stand for green spaces. Stand for smarter, fairer development.\nLet’s build a Southend worth living in – not just for now, but for the future.\n— ENDS —",

Within a few days, our petition amassed over 1700 signatures from concerned locals and gained considerable media coverage.\nIn an update received in October, Southend Council confirmed that thanks to this campaign this heritage building is now acknowledged as an Asset of Community Value (ACV), and is rightly protected under this listing.\nRead the statements posted to the Friends of the Railway campaign page:\n7 Oct 2022.\nGOOD NEWS!\nWe have today received confirmation from Southend City Council that our application to have The Railway Hotel listed as an Asset of Community Value has been successful!\nThe Council has formally recognised The Railway’s huge contribution to our city as a community and cultural venue (and much much more) and has acknowledged that it is an integral part of our city’s cultural infrastructure. ACV listing now means we have another safeguard against irresponsible development, and it means that we’re one step closer to having the pub reopen for our community’s benefit.\nI’d like to thank the 1600+ of you that signed our petition so far and the many of you who helped our campaign by emailing your councillors, sharing our updates, and helping us galvanise the support for a future for the pub. Without your help, it’s possible that we might have seen the pub added to the sadly growing list of great boozers we’ve lost to history.\nI’d additionally like to thank the South East Essex Green Party for being the initial signatories on the ACV Nominations paperwork, and for supporting us with this campaign. Thanks also to those many councillors at SCC who also lent us your support.\nSO, WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?\nGaining an Asset of Community Value (ACV) listing means that the council officially recognises that a building has significant community value; in our case as a much-loved community and cultural pub, and it recognises in planning decisions that it should be protected under applicable legislation for this purpose only. In short, it means that the council agrees with us that the Pub should remain a Pub!\nCurrently, the building is owned by Heineken/Star. This ACV listing additionally means that if the brewery wants to sell the property, it is bound to notify the community of its intention to sell, and a moratorium is placed on the sale of the building, giving the community six months to arrange the finances to buy the pub at market-rate from the current owners. This would allow the community to buy the pub itself directly, and then continue to run the venue for the good of the city as a community-owned social enterprise/cooperative.\nPut simply, it means that the current owners can’t just sell off the property to irresponsible developers that would just trash the place. The ACV listing gives us the safeguard that the community has a Right To Bid first. We want that option.\nThe Railway will now remain on this list of Assets of Community Value for five years. The current owners, Heineken/Star have the legal right to object, but we’d strongly advise they don’t waste their money. Southend has very clearly sent the message that we love The Railway, and won’t see it tarnished, degraded, or sold off.\nWHAT’S NEXT?\nPlease continue to share your stories of how important the pub is to our community!\nJust because we now have an ACV listing, we can’t become complacent. The brewery still has the ability to ruin the pub for good itself; we’ve just made it much harder for them to treat it as a disposable asset to fling off at the highest price for their shareholders’ profits.\nWe’re also completely aware we’d be going up against a faceless multinational’s well-paid litigation team if it ever does end up in court. We’re not particularly scared tbh, but as a community, we need to be collectively ready for that fight.\nThis is only the first stage of bringing the pub back into community hands. When the time comes, we need to be ready to rally our supporters to buy, and then reopen the pub. That is a LOT of work. We want to do this, and we’ll need your support.\nIf you haven’t already, please encourage friends and family to visit our website and sign the petition. We’re still asking Southend Council to include the Pub on its’ list of Heritage Assets, as we think the pub deserves recognition and protection for its heritage credentials too. Keep applying the pressure!\n26 July 2022.\nSAVE THE RAILWAY HOTEL\nPlease sign and share this petition to ask Southend Council to help Save The Railway Hotel, Southend.\nWe’re asking Southend Council to list The Railway as an “Asset of Community Value”, and to add the building to the Council’s Local List of Historic Buildings.\nPlease support our efforts, by adding your name to this petition now:\nSIGN: https://railwayhotelsouthend.co.uk/\nWHY IS THIS PETITION IMPORTANT?\nUntil its closure in late 2020, The Railway Hotel was one of Southend’s most prominent counter-cultural landmarks, beloved by a majority of residents from across the city. Its impact to the city, and its sad and premature loss is felt today by many – even far beyond the boundaries of the county.\nThe building itself bears important local architectural and historical significance to the city, on its own merits and as one of the borough’s first public houses in what is now the city centre. Its location, placed within the Banks & Barry ‘Cliff Town’ Estate (now the Milton Conservation Area), also lends further evidence to the historical significance of the building to the wider story of Southend.\nCurrently, the building (we feel wrongly) is neither listed on the National Heritage List for England (NHLE) nor is it on the Local List of Historic Buildings. This means that there is currently no protection for this Public House in terms of conservation (architecturally or aesthetically), and as a result, there is little stopping an application of irresponsible development concluding in the loss of one of the city’s assets.\nThe Railway was more than a beloved local pub; it was the crucible in which an entire generation of music, art, and culture was created and thrived in Southend. Known for its stalwart support for local, national, and international musicians of all genres, The Railway was primarily a community-spirited live music venue, as much as it was a popular public house.\nBeyond the bricks and mortar, its patrons, the Railway Community is a 5.5k strong eclectic diaspora of local art and music lovers that otherwise would have never shared one space. A glistening example of community cohesion, The Railway represented the very best of what Southend’s thriving cultural scene could offer, and was for decades one of the town’s (now city’s) liveliest venues. The pub gave a second home to a whole family of local artists and customers, many of which now feel bereft of a similar space in the city.\nThe Railway’s community engagement stretched beyond that of just a pub, as for years it proudly supported those with Special Educational Needs and Disabilities through a legacy of accessible and inclusive events, and also fundraising tens of thousands for various charities through events. The pub was proudly a ‘safe space’ for LGBTIQA+ patrons and happily played home to the alternative cultural scene (by all definitions) in Southend. The contribution The Railway has made to our city and its story cannot be underestimated.\nSadly, despite overcoming several difficult financial periods in recent history, the Coronavirus pandemic proved too much of a financial strain on the business, and the previous operators closed to the public for the last time on 31st October 2020.\nIn the past 1.5 years, it had been hoped by the community that now the building has been relinquished back to the responsibility of the Brewery/PubCo, they would reopen this busy and popular city-centre pub for eager trade. This unfortunately hasn’t happened, and the building remains empty and shuttered. As it stands, the community has been given no assurances of the long-term security of this beloved institution, and we now feel the local authority should assist in bringing this venue back into the hands of the community that wishes to see it reopen.\nWe believe fundamentally that this building must remain a community pub.\nThe Railway is a cultural icon to our city, and is an asset that cannot be lost in the same ways other significant venues are. We have reason to believe that this beloved pub is at risk of being lost forever.\nWHAT CAN WE DO?\nWe’ve already asked Southend Council to list The Railway as an ACV, and to include the building on the Council’s Local List of Historic Buildings. We believe that right now, this is one of the most effective ways we have of ensuring The Railway will reopen as a community pub.\nTo help us save The Railway:\n– Please SIGN and SHARE this petition.\n– Tell everyone; help us get the word out that we need to act quick.\n– Please consider writing to your Ward Councillors and ask them to support the ACV listing.",

We will lead the way in making sure all Southend’s residents have a safe, warm, and efficient place to call home.\nWe will lead by example in the push for wage equality, the rollout of a Living Wage across the city, and by seeking an end to the zero-hours contracts that hamper the upward mobility of our often-overlooked essential and young workers. We support local traders and seek to form new local business opportunities afforded by renewable energy technologies and responsible food production.\nWe put individuals’ health and wellbeing first, and we have a strategy to ensure that our city is healthy. We will strive to deliver a substantial investment into the health of residents, working with the NHS and public health professionals across the city to improve access to mental health care, ensuring a commitment to maintain and improve our outdoor leisure and play spaces, and by actively working to improve the water quality at our beaches.\nSouthend hosts one of the most vibrant and thriving artistic communities in East Anglia, and our wealth of talented artists, writers, and musicians not only significantly contribute to the overall identity and wellbeing of the city, but additionally attract inward investment into the borough. We will support our flourishing networks of creatives by introducing a number of small bursaries for locally-derived cultural contributions and public-realm artworks, and we will aid our local artists in securing external grants, investments, and commissions.\nAnd many, many more such policies in our Manifesto – which you can read here: https://southeastessex.greenparty.org.uk/manifesto/\nWe won’t resort to pointing out the obvious holes in the Councillor’s own manifesto, as her long and dry record of tepid inaction speaks for itself sufficiently.\nThe Green Party doesn’t resort to such dirty campaigning, and we believe that residents expect better from seasoned politicians.

Yet once again, the Council downplays the problem.\n“This isn’t what I’m hearing from concerned residents who live on adjacent roads, and families who visit Marine Gardens with their children and pets. We cannot ignore the fact that some drivers treat this road like a race track. We need action now, before a serious accident occurs.”\nSimon Gittus, Green Activist\nAdding to the urgency, Cllr. Stuart Allen remarked, “Speeding isn’t limited to Marine Parade; we’re seeing it on New Road, Station Road, and Cranleigh Drive as well. Residents know it’s an issue, the Police know it’s an issue, yet we continue to wait for another serious accident before acting. We already have had one tragic death on New Road and still we do not have a solution to slow traffic down along these roads.”\nCllr Richard Longstaff concurs, “We know where the speeding issues are and would like to see some firmed up action from the Council along these routes. I have requested a tabletop pelican crossing at the New Road bridge to the old town, and I’m suggesting that we link this up to a tabletop zebra crossing in Broadway West adjacent to the Library and Gardens entrance. These additions will make our streets safer and more enjoyable, while significantly helping to reduce traffic speeds along these roads.”\nIn response to Mr. Gittus’ question, Cllr Cowan stated, “We fully appreciate residents’ concerns with speeding across the city and actively deploy a regular programme of speed monitoring surveys and work with Community Speed Watch, who are managed by Essex County Fire and Rescue Service; this road is one of their approved sites for monitoring.\n“Our most recent speed monitoring information for this road didn’t show any particular concerns, however, as it has been some time since the last test, we have requested that this road be added to our programme for speed monitoring surveys so we can assess if there has been any increase in the levels of speed being measured. It should be noted that any specific concerns around speeding vehicles should be sent to Essex Police for further investigation.\n“Based on the current results and without yet knowing the results of the proposed survey, we would not be undertaking any further action at this time.”\n– ENDS –",

The resultant gases are then tapped and collected.\nThe high-pressure combustion process usually generates underground temperatures of 700-900°C but have been evidenced as reaching up to 1,500°C.\nThis process happens underground, creating toxic and carcinogenic coal tars that pose a significant threat to the environment.\nThe process chemically decomposes the coal and generates a cocktail of gasses including, Carbon Dioxide, Carbon Monoxide, and Methane, as well as contaminants such as Sulfur Oxides, Mono-Nitrogen Oxides, and Hydrogen Sulfides.\nTo produce significant amounts of gas, UCG would require multiple drill sites and massive processing facilities located onshore.\nUnderground coal gasification allows access to coal resources that are not economically recoverable by other technologies, e.g., seams that are too deep, low grade, or that have a thin stratum and is a classic example of extreme energy in action.\nSafety Concerns.\nUCG was given the green light for the Thames Estuary between Southend and the North Kent coast in 2012 when the UK government granted a licence to Riverside Energy to extract gas from under the Thames Estuary.\nThe area licenced includes the WW2 shipwreck of the SS. Richard Montgomery, still loaded with an estimated 1400 tonnes of explosives which for a long time has considered dangerously unstable.\nThe UCG permit is also in close proximity to the massive Isle of Grain LNG Terminal which stores one million cubic metres of Liquid Natural Gas on site and handles up to 15 million tonnes of Liquified Natural Gas per annum.\nThe process of Underground Coal Gasification (UCG) has been proven unsound and unsafe in other countries.\nThe Queensland Government has uncovered severe contamination of 320km2 of farmland surrounding Linc Energy’s UCG test site at Chinchilla, which resulted in criminal charges against the directors of the Australian company.\nToxic Syngas from underground fires has caused severe pollution to groundwater, soil, and air, putting hundreds of square kilometres of prime agricultural land west of Brisbane at risk.\nDespite these findings, UCG speculators Cluff Natural Resources and the now-collapsed Five Quarter Energy have pushed ahead with plans for pilot projects and production in the UK.\nThe government has subsequently granted 27 licences for UCG offshore, worryingly close to large population centres.\nThe government appears to have ignored evidence that vast majority of small-scale trials of UCG over the last 80 years have invariably resulted in severe water contamination and/or explosions.\nBoth Cluff and Five Quarter have previously denied that UCG is experimental and has a track record of failure.\nFive Quarter, which held 10 UK licences, called opponents of the technology “alarmist” and are known to have threatened a number of organisations and individuals with legal action.\nAlthough Five Quarter has since ceased trading, the licences will inevitably be acquired by a competitor and the threat is far from over.\nThe 320km2 (10km radius) area affected by pollution created around the Linc trial is very significant for UK communities living close to UCG licence areas.\nHundreds of thousands of people live within a 10km radius of these sites earmarked for UCG.\nUCG is not safe. It is an experimental technology with a track record of failure.\n1987: Rocky Mountain, Wyoming\nHigh levels of benzene and other carcinogenic contaminants were forced into groundwater.\n1997: El Tremedal, Spain\nDrill site explosion and blowout of toxic water. Syngas escaped the burn cavity to surrounding rock strata.\n1999: Linc Energy, Chinchilla, Queensland\nTest discontinued: 300km2 of farmland contaminated with toxic gas. Company charged with causing serious environmental harm (2015).\n2007: Eskom, Majuba, South Africa\nTwo well failures and high volumes of liquid waste caused disposal problems. The Syngas produced contained toxic and corrosive hydrogen sulphide.\n2010: Cougar Energy, Kingaroy, Queensland\nThe Kingaroy UCG well exploded after only five days of operation and resulted in carcinogenic benzene and toluene being detected in groundwater and in the fat of animals grazing in fields at the surface. Prosecuted & Fined (2013).\nThe major environmental concerns for UCG stem from subsidence, water contamination and toxic gas emissions.\nUCG is based on unproven technology; The whole process is considered to present a greater riskier than fracking, with a high risk of severe environmental damage:\n- Leakage of incredibly toxic chemicals.\n- Subsidence of nearby and adjacent land.\n- A risk to public health in densely populated areas from atmospheric pollution.\n- Groundwater contamination.\nIn October 2016 after high profile campaigns the Scottish government banned UCG (as it has fracking), however, as with fracking, the rest of the UK is still at risk.\nThe Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said the government was “minded to not support” the technique, but has not enacted a ban or withdrawn any licences.\nWe will continue to monitor the North Kent UCG/0014/S licence.\nYou can read more about UCG on the Wikipedia Page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underground_coal_gasification\nResearch for this article was partly obtained from: frack-off.org.uk\nFriends of the Earth Scotland have also written a substantial press-release regarding UCG:\nhttps://foe.scot/press-release/fuelling-the-fire-new-report-shows-underground-coal-gasification-a-reckless-experiment/",

At first sight, this might seem uncontentious, Councillors should abide by a Policy as should any member of an organisation, however when reading it carefully it appears to put a great many restrictions on what Councillors can say.\nThe following paragraph at first seems acceptable until you pick it apart, I have underlined the problem areas.\n“Don’t use social media in any way to attack, insult, abuse, defame or otherwise make negative, offensive or discriminatory comments about council staff, service users, their family or friends, colleagues, other professionals, other organisations, or the council.”\nIt includes a statement which means a Councillor cannot make a negative comment about the Council or other organisations.\nIf I, as a Councillor, cannot make negative comments about the Council how can I hold it too account if I disagree with a policy or the direction it is taking? Would I even be able to disagree with any of the proposals in the New Local Plan as I did with the old one?\nThis goes against something called the 7 Nolan Principles which state how Councillors should act. The seventh principle states\n“Holders of public office should exhibit these principles in their own behaviour. They should actively promote and robustly support the principles and be willing to challenge poor behaviour wherever it occurs.”\nI and many other Councillors are wondering how we can uphold these principles if a Policy effectively gags us from making negative comments about the Council.\nI have requested that this policy is withdrawn from the Full Council Agenda and is instead taken up by the Standards Committee to refine the Policy so that it does not restrict Councillors in the job they should be doing, I await the Councils decision.\nIt would seem that if this policy is passed on the 12th, I would be unable to even write something like this.”\n“The South Essex Green Party is opposed to any measure that threatens the democratic rights of any elected official, and we do not support this proposition from Rochford District Council.\nWe wholely affirm our commitment to reducing any abuse directed at council staff, and we support measures that secure this, but, we strongly believe that Councillors elected to hold the Council to account should be free and able to voice opposition and openly criticise the organisation they represent.”\nSections of this article were originally published on Councillor Michael Hoy’s blog ‘A Green Read.’\nThe original article is published here:\nhttps://mikehullbridge.wordpress.com/2017/12/06/to-be-gagged-or-not-to-be-gagged/\nFurther Reading:\nhttp://www.echo-news.co.uk/news/15702510.Fears_councillors_will_be____gagged____on_social_media/",

It is estimated that the East of England has lost 39% of its total nightclub venues in that period.\n“Since the pandemic, Southend has seen a dramatic reduction in our nightlife offering, with many of the City Centre’s venues now shuttered. The venues that remain open are facing unprecedented pressures; including noise complaints from new housing built near venues, dramatic increases in rents and rates, and restrictive licensing conditions.\n“Venues like this are important for fostering a thriving city centre and play a key role in the attraction, well-being, and employment opportunities of local people. Will the portfolio holder agree to meet with me and other hospitality and nightlife leaders to discuss how the council can support our vital nighttime economy?”\nIn a statement, James Vessey-Miller said;\n“We can’t discount how important Southend’s night-time economy is as both a key attraction for visitors and a significant employer of local people. But in the past few years, we’ve lost many of our cornerstone nightlife venues including Talk and Chameleon nightclubs, and more recently Ravens, Coco, and Revolution bar. The bars and clubs that remain trading in the City Centre now face new obstacles and challenges which could result in closure unless something is done. This could have a terminal impact on our city’s attractiveness as a destination and as a place to live, with significant impacts on our local economy.\n“Venue owners have told me they’re concerned that increases in rents and business rates and more restrictive licensing conditions could make operating nighttime venues unworkable. Additionally, the council has green-lit new housing developments around the High Street which will make it impossible to operate a late-opening bar or nightclub in the city centre without receiving frequent noise complaints.\n“Venue owners tell me that schemes like the Purple Flag accreditation are just window-dressing. The Council has received this award every year for 11 years, and we’ve lost eleven of our major city-centre nightclubs and bars in that same time. Most equivalent cities are seeing nightlife footfall recover to pre-pandemic levels, but not in Southend. The Council should be asking; why?\n“After speaking with local venue owners, I have taken this issue to the City Council and asked that they meet with me and other nightlife leaders to address their concerns, and discuss what can be proactively done to support these businesses.”\n– ENDS –\nPhoto credit: Jess Hawkins\nNotes for the editor:\n- DJ MAG: “65 UK nightclubs have closed in 2024 so far, with the Night Time Industries Association (NTIA) calling for urgent, targeted support from government to help with an “unprecedented crisis”.

It was the sector’s “most challenging year” of the past decade, it added.

  "https_southeastessex_greenparty_org_uk_/https_southeastessex_greenparty_org_uk_news_2018_07_09_a-dark-day-for-southend-healthcare/content_188.html": "By Simon Cross\nLast Friday, 6th July 2018 – just a day after the celebrations of the NHS’s 70th birthday, the five Mid and South Essex CCG’s met with the STP committee led by Mike Bewick to hand down the sentence in public to Orsett Hospital, the Southend University Hospital and the wellbeing of 1.5 million potential users of primary care services.\nThe premise of this meeting was to inform the public of the decisions made as a result of the recent ‘Consultation’ of the original document proposing the selling off of NHS assets, downgrading Southend Hospital, transporting acutely unwell patients on traffic-laden roads, and replacing Doctors and Nurses with Skype and Apps.\nThe ‘Consultation’ engaged with just 4,000 people out of an affected population of over 1.4 million people, making it simply a pointless focus group.\nEven in this sample of 0.3% of the affected area, nobody supported this wholesale destruction of local health provision. It became quite clear within the process that the evidence to drive these proposed changes was long discredited, outdated or not representative of our population.\nThere seems to be a total denial of the very real issues which make the patient movements proposed, frankly, dangerous. The plans were simply put together to cut costs and deliver massively-reduced health services with no thought for the inconvenience of long-distance travel for care or the patient deaths this will cause. Not to mention that the proposals were initially predicated on an improved GP service which is now not even being discussed!\nThe decision makers simply passed the entire STP proposals with no amendments whatsoever and announced the almost immediate closure of Orsett Hospital.\nThey now plan, as part of the ‘Care Closer to Home’ scheme, to force Orsett patients (if physically capable) to travel in excess of 10 miles for care which was provided on their doorstep but weeks ago. Counterintuitive much! This will make people who have infirmities incapable of accessing their NHS services.\nWhat The STP is Spinning…\nThis is the full statement from the CCG Committee:\nThe five clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) in mid and south Essex have today <Friday 6 July> given the go-ahead for plans to secure the future of health and care services.\nThe plans are a result of two years of detailed work undertaken by clinical teams across health and care organisations to improve the services provided to the 1.2 million people living in mid and south Essex and follows the outcome of a 16-week public consultation.\nThe Joint Committee of the CCGs gave approval to implement proposals, which include:\n- Making improvements in A&E at all three hospitals in Southend, Basildon and Chelmsford, with the development of new assessment and treatment centres alongside each A&E. All three A&Es will be led by a consultant, open 24 hours a day and will receive “blue light” ambulances, as well as “walk-in” patients.\n- Developing a new specialist stroke unit at Basildon Hospital, which will provide the highest dependency and intensive care for people in the first 72 hours following a stroke. The specialist unit will give rapid access to tests and specialist therapies, 24 hours a day, which will improve the chances of a good recovery. This will be in addition to the local stroke care units at all three hospitals, which will continue to provide rehabilitation and other stroke-related care, as they do now. Patients suspected of having a stroke will go by ambulance initially to the nearest A&E for stabilisation and then transfer to the specialist stroke unit for up to three days if that is what is needed. After that, patients would return home if they have made a good recovery, or go back to a facility closer to home for further rehabilitation.\n- Bringing together in one place some specialist inpatient care where there is existing expertise and to allow for extended hours, with seven days a week consultant and specialist cover for these services.\n- Separating some planned operations from emergency cases. Some complex orthopaedic operations, such as hip and knee replacements, that need a few days hospital stay will be provided at Southend Hospital for people in south Essex and Braintree Community Hospital for people in mid-Essex. This will avoid cancelled operations and reduce infection risks by separating this type of care from emergency care.\n- Moving some services closer to where people live. Services currently provided at Orsett Hospital, including tests and scans, will be provided in four new “integrated medical centres” in Thurrock and new facilities in Basildon and Brentwood. This will eventually lead to the closure of Orsett Hospital, but only when new services are up and running. The Joint Committee agreed that a patient representative group should be involved in further more detailed planning.\nThese changes are alongside the plans launched last month to build up GP and community services with a £30 million increase in annual funding to extend the range of professionals and services available via GP practices. This will create more appointments and increase care closer to where people live.\nThe committee was asked to approve 19 recommendations, set out in a decision making a business case.\nIn particular, this included specific recommendations to address the main concerns raised during the public consultation, regarding the safe transfer of patients and support for carers and relatives to visit loved ones who may be at a different hospital.\nThe full decision-making business case can be found at http://www.nhsmidandsouthessex.co.uk/decision-making-business-case/\nThe assertion that there have been any changes to the original proposals is outright deception.\nNone of the issues raised was ever adequately addressed by the focus groups, and the proposal for cross-county patient transport is not costed, not safe, not properly planned, and the STP is still lying about the numbers around expected use.\nThe idea that against the backdrop of the 44 STP ‘footprints’ up and down the country being required to close 70% of A&E facilities by 2020, the likelihood of Southend and Chelmsford retaining an A&E is non-existent within the privatisation agenda.\nDespite the STP and Conservative claims, the Government is providing NO additional money for GP services and has scrapped both the Primary Care and Social Care ‘5 Year Forward View’ documents having found them totally unworkable.\nThe £30 million of funding claimed was clearly identified within the STP business case as being purely Capital Funding (buildings and equipment not Human Resource) and would be generated from alternative sources to the NHS budget.\nSo effectively, this will be PFI money and will cost more than the value it attempts to deliver.\nThis Decision may be Unlawful.\nThe failure of a recent Judicial Review brought by Alysson Pollock, Peter Roderick and the late Stephen Hawking could still offer a lifeline.\nSome of the reasons for the Judge ruling against the case, was to force the government to hold a full public consultation regarding ACO’s (Accountable Care Organisations) and to bring forward Primary Parliamentary Legislation and a full vote.\nIn light of this information, if the STP’s can be shown to be the vehicle for the transformation of the public NHS into US Insurance and Bank controlled ACO’s then the decisions taken by STP’s will also be unlawful!\nI cannot personally understand why these people are still blithely selling off our NHS and that the Government has not halted all progress towards this when these actions can (and hopefully will) be considered an illegal act?\nThis is the statement regarding the Judicial Review:\nDearest supporters,\nToday the High Court handed down its judgement on the judicial review we brought against the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care and NHS England on their introduction of Accountable Care Organisations (ACOs). We had originally brought our claim on four grounds – two on the lack of proper consultation, one on the legality of the idea itself, and one on grounds of lack of clarity and transparency. We withdrew our claim on the consultation grounds when our opponents conceded that they would not proceed without a full national consultation, so this success was in the bag.\nUnfortunately, the Court has found against us on the law on the other two grounds.\nOn legality – whilst making clear that he was not deciding on the merits of ACOs, and acknowledging that we raised “perfectly good and sensible questions…..about the ACO policy and the limitations of the terms and conditions in the draft ACO Contract” – Mr Justice Green decided that the ACO policy is lawful because the Health and Social Care Act 2012 gives very broad discretion to Clinical Commissioning Groups when commissioning services.\nAnd on clarity and transparency – whilst resoundingly rejecting the government’s argument that the principle did not apply “in relation to what by common accord is intended to amount to radical and transformational changes in the way in which health and social care is delivered” – he decided that the principle was not yet engaged.\nThere is more about the judgment below on the Crowdjustice site:https://www.crowdjustice.com/case/jr4nhs-round3/\nWe have decided not to appeal against this decision for several reasons.\nApart from the extra costs involved, our opponents have already been forced to change their plans. In order to win the case, they had to argue that ACO contracts were just like other provider contracts, and not the fundamental change to the governance of the NHS that we know they intended. The judge recounts in detail how their position changed as they began to appreciate the power of our claim. The commissioning functions of CCGs were to be – illegally – delegated to ACOs – but instead are now reinforced, and if the government wishes to continue on the original path to creating ACOs, primary legislation will be needed and CCGs will have to retain sufficient staff and resources. The Health and Social Care Select Committee has called for legislation, and the Prime Minister included the possibility of new legislation for the NHS in her speech a couple of weeks ago. In addition, the promised consultation will have to be lawfully conducted, and any eventual ACO contract – in Dudley, Manchester or wherever – will have to be lawfully entered into. 999 Call for the NHS are still engaged in legal action, seeking leave to appeal the decision in their judicial review, but for us, the campaign moves out of the courtroom – at least for now – and continues in the local and political arenas, and on to the consultation.\nWe are extremely grateful to the thousands of people who have allowed us to bring this challenge. Thank you again from the bottom of our hearts for all your encouragement and financial support. We do not believe that this has been wasted, and we hope you agree. We deeply regret the judgment and we imagine you will share our disappointment. But we hope its effect will be to strengthen resolve to hold the government to account during the consultation, and raise public awareness of the issues at stake if contracts for billions of pounds of public money lasting ten or more years are awarded to new bodies not established by statute, which could be partly or wholly private companies, and which could outsource all their services if they wished.\nThis could be our final line of defence as the NHS is not actually in the hands of government anymore; It is clear that the Bankers, Insurers and Big Pharma have been controlling the NHS for several decades without us noticing.\nWe have possibly been looking the wrong way in our campaigns because while the NHS is highly political, it certainly is not a Party Political.\nThe battle we need to have is to prevent any private body taking a pecuniary advantage of healthcare provision.\nThe more Barclays and Virgin fail, the less attractive it becomes to other business interests circling overhead.\nA Final Note of Caution.\nThere has been a lot of nuanced and supposed cross-party debate on whether the public would pay a ringfenced tax.\nThis is a trojan horse and very much what happened in Spain and Holland, whose healthcare systems are now experiencing the problems of multipayer health systems. The idea of a ringfenced tax is that it can be easily converted into an insurance which means it can easily be transferred to the Private Sector. The most likely reason Politicians favour this is that it leads to a ‘Bismarck’ style Health Service.\nThe Bismarck System.\nNamed for the Prussian Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, who invented the welfare state as part of the unification of Germany in the 19th century.\nDespite its European heritage, this system of providing health care would look fairly familiar to Americans. It uses an insurance system — the insurers are called “sickness funds” — usually financed jointly by employers and employees through payroll deduction.\nUnlike the U.S. insurance industry, though, Bismarck-type health insurance plans have to cover everybody, and they don’t make a profit. Doctors and hospitals tend to be private in Bismarck countries; Japan has more private hospitals than the U.S. Although this is a multi-payer model — Germany has about 240 different funds — tight regulation gives government much of the cost-control clout that the single-payer Beveridge Model provides.\nThe Bismarck model is found in Germany, of course, and France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Japan, Switzerland, and, to a degree, in Latin America.\n(PNHP Resources).\nThe South East Essex Green Party strongly object to the STP’s recently announced decisions and furthermore will continue being some of the ‘Folk with Faith to Fight for it’.",

She highlights its impact on natural spaces and the wider community.\nMs Hogrebe, who also stood for Southend City Council in St. Luke’s ward earlier this year, stated, “We are seeing a troubling expansion of new facilities and infrastructure encroaching on previously wild land.

What’s more, areas originally set aside by charitable trusts for public benefit are now being fenced off and are inaccessible to those who can’t afford the hire fees.

These items have since been safely collected and disposed of by neighbourhood Green volunteers.\nOur activists have also noticed a dramatic increase in the number of antibacterial single-use cloth wet wipes being found littered in bushes and verges, despite Anglian Water launching a campaign last year to encourage residents in the town to dispose of them correctly.\nDiscarded PPE poses an unnecessary increase in risk and workload for our town’s refuse collectors, street cleaning teams, and the council’s Parks Department, who as often-overlooked essential workers, are already working hard through lockdown to keep our streets and green spaces safe, open, and tidy.\nThere is no excuse for discarding used PPE or cleaning wipes on our streets, and doing so could endanger our key workers and result in offenders being issued with fines from £150 to £2500.\nYou can check online in seconds to see how best to clean, recycle, or dispose of your used PPE correctly and safely, and we highly recommend residents take used PPE home with them to decide what to do with it there.\nItems such as gloves and masks pose a significant risk to wildlife, especially in a marine environment where ingestion can cause fatal suffocation to many animals. Additionally, many single-use latex and vinyl gloves are un-recyclable and do not biodegrade, meaning that PPE litter discarded now can pose a threat to wildlife for potentially thousands of years if disposed of incorrectly.\n“Many people across Southend are understandably seeking out and using protective gloves and masks in a bid to contain and stop the spread of the Coronavirus. Whilst I’d encourage residents to utilise whatever protection they deem necessary to feel safe, I’d strongly recommend people check online how to dispose of their PPE correctly, and to do so.”\n– SEEGP Coordinator, James Vessey-Miller.\nKeeping parks and green spaces open to the public during this crisis is essential to maintaining the physical and mental wellbeing of those residents who do not have access to green space at home. Ensuring that these open spaces remain open, but unaffected by visitors should be a top priority for Southend Council.\nDespite the increase in litter, closing parks, gardens, and beaches is not the answer and will disproportionately affect those from low-income backgrounds who cannot access the outdoors from the safety of home.\nNationally, The Green Party has urged the government to help local authorities redeploy staff from non-essential roles in order to keep parks and green spaces open.\nThe Greens are also calling on the government to make park maintenance a statutory duty for local authorities and ensure that funding is provided to reverse the cuts felt across 92% of parks departments.",

This will infringe on the wonderful green area, in an already fully developed area. This park includes playing fields that so many local people enjoy in the summer.”\nSouthend already has one of the worst Air Pollution crises in the UK, and encouraging car travel to a park in a quiet residential area is not sensible. The Southchurch Park area is already served well by several regular bus services and the main seafront cycling route, and encouraging parents to use this new car park to take children to school will do nothing to help alleviate the air pollution and congestion around this area.\nWe should be encouraging the creation of walking buses, and aiming to get children to school via environmentally-conscious and healthy active travel alternatives, such as walking and cycling. Many parents currently feel that sending their children to school on bikes in Southend is unsafe and that just highlights the core issue. With an integrated network of safe cycle lanes crossing the town and genuinely safe cycle infrastructure as the Greens advocate, parents needn’t worry.\nAllocating crucial funding towards improving our cycling infrastructure is what is desperately required, and this kind of funding is currently being diverted towards building useless car parks by a climate-complacent council.\nYou can’t persuade people to use public transport and adopt active travel whilst simultaneously making car usage more convenient.\nYet again, rather than tackle the core issues of congestion and car parking, our councillors are looking to build on Green spaces for a quick fix.\nDespite our council declaring a climate emergency (seemingly in name only), our councillors are still pushing for the extension of a facility for intra-town car usage which is wrong.\nIn a time of unprecedented destruction of our natural environment, this is not what our town needs.\nPlease sign and share this petition to show Southend Council that we will not stand for the destruction of any more green space in Southend!\nIf you would like to help Jo and our other Green Party activists in their campaigns, please subscribe to our free mailing list.",

There are huge environmental and social implications to how a council values tree maintenance. This motion aims to improve our tree management, especially the management of declining trees, to maximise the benefits and lifespan of trees on council-owned or council-managed land.\nSouthend’s urban trees are assets of immense community value, providing tree canopy cover (TCC) which is proven to reduce ‘urban heat island effect’ that is the cause of an increasing number of fatalities across Europe due to climate heating.\nDespite significant tree planting in recent years our TCC currently stands at 13% on average, and just 10% in Leigh-on-Sea. The value of mature trees cannot adequately be replaced by saplings so we must do more to retain our mature trees and to improve our current TCC to the Forestry Commission’s recommendation of 15% at the very least.\nMore trees will bring many benefits to our city such as an improvement in air quality, greater local sequestering of carbon to aid our Net Zero ambitions, and a positive effect on the mental health of local people.\nTo maintain and increase our TCC we must seek to prolong the lifespans of our mature trees alongside planting thousands of new ones through a variety of methods including tree planting-focused grant applications. This will require a progressive and pragmatic approach to tree management and a refinement of practices with a preservation-first approach.\nTherefore, Southend-on-Sea City Council resolves to:\n- Establish a biodiversity and tree retention working party with observers from external organisations with knowledge and expertise in arboriculture and biodiversity. The remit of the working party will be to consider tree management and preservation, including assessing trees marked for removal, unless there is a perceived immediate risk, and to informally advise the administration on matters of tree preservation, maintenance, and biodiversity.\n- Invoke an immediate moratorium on tree felling where there is not an immediate risk to the public until there has been a review of existing practices around maintenance and retention of highways trees to develop an alternative methodology toolbox to align with best practice under the Tree Design Action Group, the Forestry Commission and the Tree Council of Great Britain.\n- Embed quality assurances procedures within a tree retention policy as part of best practice so that common scenarios can be actioned quickly and without ambiguity.\n- Continuously seek funding opportunities to bid for to plant new trees.\n- Review potential planting locations across the city and keep an up-to-date map for the use of tree officers and highways surveyors.\n- Where practicable, seek to plant replacement trees as far in advance as possible of a removal.\n- Where practicable, plant larger, more mature trees in build-outs at the end of double yellow line demarcations to alleviate pressure on our drainage system from stormwater attenuation and to preserve the integrity and longevity of our highways trees and nearby footpaths.\nThis is the first motion put to Southend City Council by the Green Party, and we’re delighted to report it was passed with cross-party support.\nThe results of the vote were as follows:\nFOR:\nCllr Richard Longstaff (Proposer)\nCllr Steve Aylen (Seconder)\nCllr Martin Berry\nCllr Margaret Borton\nCllr Laurie Burton\nCllr Paul Collins\nCllr Daniel Cowan\nCllr Tricia Cowdrey\nCllr Matt Dent\nCllr Fay Evans\nCllr Stephen George\nCllr Ian Gilbert\nCllr John Harland\nCllr Lydia Hyde\nCllr Anne Jones\nCllr Gabriel Leroy\nCllr Aston Line\nCllr Robert McMullan\nCllr Carole Mulroney\nCllr Cheryl Nevin\nCllr Mandy O’Connor\nCllr Donna Richardson\nCllr Kevin Robinson\nCllr Maxine Sadza\nCllr Mike Stafford\nCllr Martin Terry\nCllr Steven Wakefield\nCllr Nick Ward\nAGAINST:\nCllr Ron Woodley\nNO VOTE:\nCllr Helen Boyd\nCllr Kevin Buck\nCllr Colin Campbell\nCllr Owen Cartey\nCllr James Courtenay\nCllr Tony Cox\nCllr Meg Davidson\nCllr Alan Dear\nCllr Nigel Folkard\nCllr David Garston\nCllr Stephen Habermel\nCllr Darryl Jones\nCllr James Moyies\nCllr Daniel Nelson\nCllr Jack Warren\nENDS",

His focus: upgrading bus stops, improving signage, and accelerating the shift toward electric buses.\n“If we’re going to reduce the strain on our at-capacity infrastructure, we need to be encouraging people to use the bus more,” Simon said. “Right now, buses are competing against each other, shelters are in disrepair, and signage is often non-existent, making it incredibly difficult for people to even know where the routes run.”\nMr Gittus is calling for what he describes as “London-style” bus stop signage, with clearly marked routes, journey times, and maps – an upgrade he argues is long overdue.\nCllr Richard Longstaff, Green Party Councillor for Leigh Ward, agreed, “In so many cities around Europe people rely on the bus to get around instead of using their cars. It’s about time we change the narrative here in Southend and make buses as accessible to as many people as possible so that anyone and everyone can rely on our bus services.”\nHis push comes amid recent fare hikes by the Labour government, a move that has drawn criticism from the Green Party. With rising costs making public transport less attractive, The Greens are hoping that – at the very least – basic infrastructure improvements can be fast-tracked.\n– ENDS –\nSimon Gittus will be asking Cllr Paul Collins at the Full Council meeting on the 20th February the following:\nI welcome the proposed investment in our struggling bus network, a long-overdue step toward improving public transport in our communities. Could the portfolio holder clarify how the £1.8 million in capital funding will be allocated? Will this investment include essential upgrades such as a transition to electric vehicles, clearer and more comprehensive signage to help passengers navigate routes with ease, and well-designed green-roofed shelters that offer genuine protection from the elements and support biodiversity? These measures would not only enhance the user experience but also encourage greater uptake of public transport at a time when sustainable travel has never been more important.\nSimon can be followed on Social Media at simongittus.green on Facebook and Instagram.",

Of the 49 areas it studied, it found that following the lifting of national restrictions the air pollution in 39 towns and cities returned to pre-pandemic levels despite economic activity not doing the same. In the case of Southend, recorded air pollution levels exceeded the pre-lockdown levels.\nEvolution of NO2 concentration levels before and after the introduction of the first national lockdown. (© Centre for Cities)\nThey go on to suggest that “… the long-term impact of the pandemic may be to make pollution worse as changed behaviour becomes entrenched even as economic activity is restored.” and that “policy needs to disincentivise car and other vehicle usages to improve air quality.”\nAir pollution is a silent killer. Research shows it causes 40,000 deaths a year. A recent study also suggested that 15 per cent of Covid deaths could be attributed to air pollution, through its harmful impact on cardiovascular and respiratory conditions.\nCentre for Cities’ Chief Executive Andrew Carter said:\n“Toxic air has contributed to the deaths of thousands of Covid-19 victims this year and, even after the pandemic ends, will remain a big threat to health – particularly for those living in urban areas. City leaders can reduce the threat of air pollution, but it will take political will. Discouraging car usage will be unpopular in the short-term but, if coupled with the necessary improvements to public transport, the long-term benefits to public health and the economy will be huge and our cities will become better places to live. Now is not the time for politicians to delay on this.”\nSouthend has its fair share of Air Quality problems.\nMain roads such as the A127, with hotspots like Prince Avenue, are glaringly-obvious issues.\nIn 2016, the Council implemented an Air Quality Management Area (AQMA) for the area surrounding the Bell Junction and has been ‘monitoring’ the issue ever since. Despite four years of the AQMA, latest figures from Friends of the Earth suggests that the area still receives Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) figures of 45.2µg/m3, exceeding the World Health Organisation’s safe upper limit of 40µg/m3.\nWest Street, East Street, and Priory Crescent have also recently been touted by the council as potential new AQMAs, with these hotspots reaching as high as 51µg/m3 of NO2 in tests.\nBut whilst the A127 has received attention from the media and the council, other areas of high NO2 and PM2.5 particulate emissions including; London Road by Chalkwell Park, the Victoria Gateway leading on to Queensway, and the many miles of residential housing underneath the Southend Airport flightpath have been completely overlooked, and remain a persistent cause of concern for residents.\nThe council has recently announced as part of its plan to tackle air pollution, it will be spending £120,000 per year for five years on “Air Quality Specialists” to advise the council in its new Local Plan.\nWhat the council seems to forget is that simply watching a ship sink from a distance does nothing to prevent drowned sailors.\nDespite the implementation of the single AQMA in 2016, and the prospect of a few more arriving in coming months, regardless of expensive advisors, monitoring alone does not equate to firm action on the issue; it’s that last part the Council seem keen to avoid.\nSo, what can be done about air pollution?\nThe council maintains that air quality issues exist only in small “but controlled” areas. To date, councillors and officers alike continue to suggest that air quality issues exist only within the confines of the existing AQMAs and that long-term monitoring will at some point inform future decisions.\nThe problem is that poor air quality is a serious borough-wide issue affecting residents’ health now, and the causes and solutions are obvious.\nIt will come as no surprise that the root cause of a vast majority of Southend’s air pollution issues stems from transportation. This can be broken into three distinct categories, each with individual solutions. These are:\n1: Cross Town Transit\nThe biggest category of this pollution is predominantly cross-town transit; residents moving via car within the confines of the town, conducting daily activities such as going to work, dropping the kids off to school, shopping, visiting friends and family etc.\nA dramatic shift is required to transition these cross-town trips from residents’ own cars to greener alternatives like public transport and active travel such as cycling and walking. For that to happen, we believe that the Greenest option should always be the cheapest and most convenient option.\nBus use across the town remains low compared to other towns, and the mishmash, disjointed, and dangerous cycle routes and infrastructure across the town actively discourage the town’s many would-be cyclists.\nA substantial improvement in the reliability, accessibility, and affordability of public transport is key to this transition. The council can play a useful role in aiding this by prioritising public transport in town planning with new dedicated bus lanes, by identifying new and convenient transport corridors, implementing new safe segregated cycle routes, and by installing ‘alternative travel’ signs and waypoints.\nThe Green Party commit to completely overhauling our patchy and unreliable bus networks through greater partnership with the borough’s bus operators, and we will deliver unprecedented investment into cycling infrastructure, with new routes and street furniture, allowing for the swift and clean cross-town transit that our residents deserve.\nYou can read more about what we stand for in Our Manifesto.\n2: Tourism & Visitors\nA secondary source of much of the town’s traffic (and subsequently pollution) is seasonal tourism to the town’s seaside attractions and year-round visitors from neighbouring areas.\nWhilst in an ideal world all tourists visiting the town would do so via one of the two rail lines, this unfortunately still isn’t the case for most of the families that visit the town each summer. We shouldn’t seek to put off daytrippers, however, so the emphasis then has to be how to make travel to Southend for tourists convenient and enjoyable, whilst also reducing the number of polluting vehicles entering the town.\nAn option for a Park & Ride facility has been suggested before, and it’s a scheme that (pending feasibility tests) is something that we would happily support, and that would hopefully reduce the overall number of vehicles entering the town. This concept would secondarily reduce the amount of stationary and slow-moving traffic experienced throughout the town during warm weather. Similar schemes have proved successful in Ipswich, Colchester, and Chelmsford.\nThe council also has the ability to implement a borough-wide Low Emissions Zone, restricting the most polluting vehicles from entering the town, similar to schemes already in place in London and Oxford. Such a scheme, if in combination with improved electric car charging points in all car parks, could see a dramatic reduction in the number of older inefficient vehicles using our congested streets.\n3: London Southend Airport\nLondon Southend Airport is undoubtedly one of the (if not, the number one) biggest polluting businesses in Southend.\nIn 2019, the Airport handled 32,655 aircraft movements, ferrying over 2million passengers; with plans to expand that figure to 10M passengers by 2030. Every plane that takes off subjects thousands of homes underneath the flightpath and beyond to substantial levels of NO2 and PM2.5 emissions and noise, significantly contributing to the pollution affecting the health of residents across the town.\nThe significant NO2 and PM2.5 pollution impact of the airport are second only to its inherent (and worsening) CO2 emissions. This pollution output is not only from direct aviation operation (planes) but additionally from the many cars (staff and passengers) and cargo vehicles travelling to and from the Airport and adjoining terminals on a daily basis.\nThis environmental impact will only worsen with the completion of the new Airport Business Park, creating airport-dependent businesses, and giving the airport more clout in its arguments of ‘expansion for survival’. This includes the deeply-unpopular Amazon cargo night-flights that have been disturbing half the town’s sleep for months.\nTo date, almost all Councillors in town have been nothing but supportive of this polluting industry, citing the economy and employment. Calculations that have been undertaken by local FoE Environmentalist Jon Fuller, however, prove that far from being a net benefit to the town, the airport actually exacerbates a £181Million deficit, with more money leaving the town than is brought inward from tourism and generated in employment.\nAs the Airport sets its sights on further and further increase and expansion, we’d suggest that the Council seriously considers its contradictory position of on-paper “wanting to address” the Climate Emergency whilst also blindly supporting the biggest polluting industry in Southend.\nThe Green Party oppose any further expansion or financial support of Southend Airport and businesses that are ancillary to its existence, pursuing all options to ban night flights, ban weekend flights before 10 am and seek an airport contribution to acoustic insulation grants for residents adversely impacted by noise.\nGreen Party Coordinator for South East Essex, James Vessey-Miller said;\n“This new data should be of serious concern to Southend Council. Kicking the issue into the long grass by conducting long and expensive studies, when we already know the causation and the solutions to the problem isn’t quite the urgency that was promised when the council ceremoniously declared a ‘Climate Emergency’ in 2019.\nPoor air quality has and is continuing to kill people as well as significantly impact the cardiovascular and respiratory health of many residents, including schoolchildren. With several schools, a hospice, and a hospital close to the (existing and proposed) AQMAs, and many more people impacted by this scourge, it’s high time the council took the necessary actions to tackle this sufficiently.\nThe existing AQMAs aren’t the full extent of the problem, and health-impacting air pollution is a problem right across town. The council needs to urgently treat this as a borough-wide problem, and seek to make the tough but necessary decisions to protect the health of our citizens and take us forward.\nSBC is yet to announce what areas these air quality specialists will be advising on, and if, crucially, these advisors will be given the independence to adequately challenge the council on its anthology of poor planning. Any expert worth their salt will tell the council that they’re sitting on decades of misguided mistakes and that we urgently need to transform Southend to meet the oncoming challenges of Climate Change and ecological collapse.”\nGreen Party Candidate for St Laurence Ward, Oli Thorn said;\n“We’ve all seen the considerable reduction in congestion on our roads, and even the notably cleaner air in our community during the lockdown. The Government has been quick to praise this reduction in CO2 emissions this year, but emissions are rising back to normal. We can do better than returning to normal, we can push for implementation of more effective emission reduction policies, and create a New Normal of safer and cleaner air for our community.”\nIf you would like to help the Green Party tackle air pollution in Southend, please consider becoming a member today.\nSources & Further Reading:\nhttps://www.centreforcities.org/publication/covid-pandemic-lockdown-air-quality-cities/\nhttps://airqualitynews.com/2020/10/27/15-of-global-covid-deaths-attributed-to-air-pollution/\nhttps://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ambient-(outdoor)-air-quality-and-health\nhttps://www.echo-news.co.uk/news/18625942.polluted-road-southend-revealed/\nhttps://www.echo-news.co.uk/news/18714444.polluted-southend-junctions-council-must-take-action/\nhttps://www.echo-news.co.uk/news/18156969.southend-council-spend-120k-air-quality-specialist/\nhttps://www.nhs.uk/news/lifestyle-and-exercise/safe-levels-of-air-pollution-could-still-be-harmful/\nhttps://airqualitynews.com/2020/02/18/revealed-every-uk-airport-has-plans-to-expand/\nhttps://www.echo-news.co.uk/news/18817727.tourism-southend-airport-takes-cash-country/",

  "https_southeastessex_greenparty_org_uk_/https_southeastessex_greenparty_org_uk_news_2021_04_20_greens-publish-results-of-cycling-survey/content_270.html": "The survey, which has been open for eight months, saw avid bikers and non-cyclists alike contribute to the results. The data published today paints a promising picture of many would-be cyclists, that are let down by the town’s poor cycling infrastructure.\nThe Results:\nWhilst 43% of our respondents said their usual form of transport was their own car – when asked if their usual form of transport became temporarily unavailable, 38% of responders said that cycling would be their next preference, over walking or public transport.\nOnly 10% of respondents thought that the council sufficiently priorities cycling.\n86% of respondents felt that bike theft is an issue of concern in Southend, and that the Police and Council are not doing enough to tackle bike theft across the town. 63% of people we asked said that they would not feel comfortable locking up their bicycle in town or at train stations, and said they would be concerned that their bike would not be safe if left unattended. A further 19% of people said they had previously been a victim of bike theft in Southend.\n84.95% said they would not feel comfortable with cycling with their children or younger members of their family across Southend, with only 7.5% saying they regularly cycle to school with their children.\nFeedback:\nA sample of some of the comments we received in the survey are as follows:\nBrian – Westborough“I’m the former chair of Just Ride Southend, and I have spent six years listening to people express their fear of the roads. Our own volunteers have nearly all been involved in accidents with poorly driven vehicles, some resulting in hospitalisation. If you are serious about encouraging cycling, make it safer and make car travel less attractive.” Jackie – Shoeburyness\n“I learned to ride a bike at the grand old age of 46 and naively thought this would be welcomed as a good, citizenly thing to do. I have been horrified at the anti-cycling sentiment I have faced ever since, both on social media and the road. While out riding, I have been sworn at, had lit cigarettes thrown at me, a full can of lager chucked at me and had to endure countless unsafe manoeuvres by motorists. I believe I am a careful and considerate cyclist, and that I follow the Highway Code far more than the average motorist does. And yes, I’m insured and I do pay road fuel licence!” Barry – Chalkwell\n“I’d create a more extensive, denser network of cycle routes, giving cyclists priority over other vehicles in designated residential streets that form part of the routes. Signage should make clear everywhere that cyclists have priority over other vehicles on cycle routes.” Sheilagh – West Shoebury\n“I would link up all the cycle paths across the borough. I would add cycle signage to the main road signs. I would install bike racks evenly spaced along each road in the borough.” Lucy – West Shoebury\n“Wider paths, clear routes, more safe bike sheds, it would be wonderful if kids could cycle to school anywhere in town and as parents, we know they are safe.” Simon – Chalkwell\n“Segregated cycle lanes on or parallel and nearby to major thoroughfares. Advanced stop lines at most junctions. Dutch-style roundabouts. Road architecture that prioritises cycling. 20mph for residential streets. Low traffic neighbourhoods where cycling and walking are the more natural ways of getting about.” Hannah – West Leigh\n“The cycle lanes along the seafront are good, but I wish there were cycle lanes along the London road.”\nThe results of the survey aren’t shocking, and the feedback from the town’s cyclists isn’t new either.\nCyclists across town have been calling for improved infrastructure for years, and the council continuously fails to deliver the new schemes it promises.\nAt a time of climate emergency, it is more important than ever that the council takes bold measures to decarbonise our cross-town transit – and a good place to start is with cycling.\nJust looking at a map of the current cycling routes through the town centre illustrates the problem. Unconnected and illogical routes unproductive for swift travel, often leave cyclists at risk at major junctions and force many to mount the pavement for their safety.\nBusy roads that are considered major transit routes for cars and buses throughout the town offer no designated road space for cyclists. Those few crossings and junctions that do offer advanced stop lines for cyclists appear and disappear with no cycle lanes to help bicycles cut through the standstill traffic. Pulling away at a red light with several buses behind you is a too-common nightmare that dissuades many parents from cycling on the roads with their children.\nA chronic issue throughout the town’s road design is that for the last 70 years town planning has assumed car travel is the default for every resident. We’re left with congested roads that are unwelcoming to the borough’s many would-be cyclists, and we have a notable absence of cycle storage.\nOn-street cycle storage furniture is randomly located and too often left to businesses to provide. The few sites where pavement bike lockup is offered, it’s usually in poorly lit areas with no CCTV coverage, and little foot traffic to dissuade the rampant bike thieves that our data suggests have struck one-fifth of the town’s cyclists.\nArguably, the only useful and safe cycle routes in the town currently are those along the Prittle Brook Greenway and the segregated cycle path along the Seafront. Both these schemes combine useful East/West routes where cyclists are given safe space segregated from busy motor traffic, and this naturally translates to high usage by cyclists.\nAn overwhelming majority of the respondents to our survey suggest they’d cycle more if a larger network of useful and safe segregated cycle lanes existed in the town. Specific requests for more prevalent and more secure cycle lockups across the borough, safer routes for children to cycle to school, and better signage and road markings are also cheap and effective ways of helping our town’s cyclists.\nThat leaves us wondering why the council doesn’t do just precisely that?\nThere’s already more than enough room on our streets for new segregated safe cycle lanes; and on most roads in Southend, this can be achieved without entirely removing existing on-street car parking. Many neighbourhoods of Paris and Copenhagen have parking layouts where parked cars are used as a barrier between cyclists and moving traffic, which in turn forces vehicles to travel more slowly, bettering road safety for pedestrians. Such “woonerfs” schemes already exist in Amsterdam and could be adopted in Southend.\n“If you’re making any kind of change to the road, think, would I feel okay recommending to my neighbour that their eight-year-old child can travel to school alone on this route? That is the standard we should be going for. Because if it’s okay for our neighbour’s eight-year-old to cycle or walk to school with safe crossings via this route, then it’s going to be safe for older people, it’s going to be safe for disabled people, and you’re going to have inclusive streets. But we have to completely rethink that basic assumption that roads are for just cars. Our roads should be for people.”\nThe Green Party’s View:\nCouncil transit policy has historically encouraged the use of the private car, causing an air quality crisis in our town, and wasting £Millions of public money on road widening/construction schemes that can never tackle ever-growing congestion.\nIt is evident from experience that only the Green Party can be trusted to deliver the radical measures needed to solve our traffic nightmares and to implement a financially and environmentally responsible solution that works in everyone’s interests, delivering the much-needed investment in low-carbon transport infrastructure our town needs.\nWe commit to completely overhauling our patchy and unreliable bus networks through greater partnership with the borough’s bus operators, and we will deliver unprecedented investment into cycling infrastructure, with new routes and street furniture, allowing for the swift and clean cross-town transit that our residents deserve.\nRichard Longstaff, our candidate for Leigh said:“I think one of the most earnest priorities of our Borough Council should be to prioritise cycling and active transport as the preference above all other forms of transport and actively promote and campaign at all levels across the borough to encourage citizens to switch and ditch the car for good. Rather than increasing car park provision, it should be reduced. It is scandalous that car parking is to be increased; this is the complete antithesis of the policies that should be proposed right now in light of the council’s decision to declare a climate emergency and to decarbonise by 2030.”\nThe data we collect will help us campaign for more sense-based town design, and help promote cycling across town.\nTAKE THE SURVEY",

Allen’s motion, set for debate on March 20, proposes grants and awareness campaigns to encourage hedgehog-friendly gardens and reduce reliance on chemical pesticides.\nIn a bid to restore reducing hedgehog populations, Councillor Stuart Allen, Green Party for Leigh Ward, has submitted a motion calling for the creation of a city-wide network of hedgehog highways, helping hedgehogs move more easily between gardens and making our streets greener and more wildlife-friendly.\nThe UK’s hedgehog population has plummeted over the past six decades. Once estimated at 30 million in the 1950s, the number has now dropped to fewer than one million across England, Scotland, and Wales. One major factor in this decline is the widespread use of concrete gravel boards, which seal off the natural pathways between gardens, forcing hedgehogs onto roads and leaving populations increasingly isolated.\nHedgehogs play a crucial role in maintaining healthy ecosystems, acting as natural pest controllers by feeding on slugs, snails, and caterpillars. Their presence supports biodiversity and soil health, reducing the need for chemical pesticides.\n“When was the last time you saw a hedgehog? We need to act now to reverse their decline. I am bringing this motion to Full Council to raise awareness and provide grants to support hedgehog-friendly initiatives – whether that’s replacing gravel boards with accessible alternatives or encouraging residents to create more welcoming spaces for them. These wonderful creatures are not only a gardener’s best ally but a vital part of our local environment. More hedgehogs mean fewer chemicals in the soil.”\nCllr Stuart Allen, Leigh Ward\nCllr. Allen’s motion, seconded by Independent Councillor Susan Badger, will be debated at Full Council on 20 March. If passed, the initiative could mark a significant step toward making the city a more hospitable place for its disappearing hedgehog population.\n– ENDS –\nNotes to editor:\nCllr Allen’s motion states:\nThis Council notes that hedgehog populations in England have experienced a significant decline over the past six decades. In the 1950s, it was estimated that there were approximately 30 million hedgehogs across the UK; today, the population has fallen to well below one million across England, Scotland, and Wales combined.\nOne contributing factor to this decline is the widespread use of concrete gravel boards, which obstruct natural travel routes between gardens. This forces hedgehogs onto roads, leading to increased fatalities and fragmented populations.\nHedgehogs play a vital role in maintaining healthy ecosystems by providing natural pest control, contributing to biodiversity, and improving soil health. Their presence supports the balance of our natural environment, which is increasingly under threat.\nThis Council therefore resolves to:\n- Establish a Hedgehog Highway Scheme to support existing residential areas, raising public awareness and providing grants to homeowners who replace concrete gravel boards with timber alternatives featuring hedgehog access holes.\n- Incorporate hedgehog-friendly design into planning conditions for new developments, requiring the inclusion of hedgehog access holes in fencing and ensuring residents are informed of their purpose.\n- Explore further initiatives to enhance local hedgehog populations, including the promotion of wildlife-friendly gardening practices and a reduction in pesticide use.\nThis Council recognises the importance of proactive conservation measures and commits to supporting the protection and recovery of hedgehog populations within our local area.",

Over the years several more cinemas popped up in Southend but one by one they failed to stay profitable and were forced to screen their last films – even the historic building on Alexandra Street that first introduced Southend to the magic of cinema was demolished in 2017. Cinemas in Southend simply couldn’t survive the increasing costs and decreasing attendance… except one.\nThe Odeon at Victoria Plaza opened in 1997 and quickly established itself as one of Southend’s social and cultural landmarks. Until the recent COVID-19 outbreak, the Odeon Southend had served audiences uninterrupted 364 days a year for 22 years.\nIt seems surprising then that for the last eight years there have been talks of a second cinema at Seaway only a few minutes walk from Victoria Plaza. Although cinema attendance has been slowly growing since its record low in the mid-80s, the number of people attending appears to have mostly levelled out over the last 10 years. To introduce another multiplex just walking distance from Southend High Street seems nonsensical. If they were forced to compete it’s certain that neither could thrive simultaneously.\nWhy are developers so intent on adding another building to Southend’s cinema graveyard?\nAs a former employee of the Odeon in Southend, I know how important it is to so many of us.\nI believe the building serves a purpose beyond just a cinema; I honestly see it as the heart of the High Street. Even if you disregard all the time spent watching films there, it’s a landmark when asking for directions, a warm place to duck into while waiting to meet friends and yes… it seems to be the High Street’s most popular loo!\nIn fact, due to its late opening hours, the Odeon has even been used by vulnerable people seeking help at night on rare occasions.\nI include myself in the countless number of people whose first ‘no-grownups’ outing was to the Odeon. For so many parents to trust the Odeon with their children’s independence is a testament to the safe environment the staff are able to maintain. It helps that the Odeon at Southend couldn’t be better positioned for public transport, being a minute’s walk from a train station, several bus stops, and a taxi rank.\nSo what reasons do developers use to justify another cinema?\nSome may argue that an additional cinema in Southend would bring a wider variety of film screenings, but this argument holds little weight when the smallest amount of scrutiny is applied to it.\nAs an 8 screen multiplex with over 1500 seats, Odeon Southend can and does regularly screen indie films, foreign cinema, and documentaries at a time when massive Hollywood blockbusters dominate smaller cinemas. In fact, Odeon screens more than just films; live streams from theatre and opera performances in London always draw in big crowds, and once every four years you can watch England matches from the world cup live with hundreds of other fans on the big screen. In addition, Southend is lucky enough to be host to a lively local Film Festival and several smaller venues that screen even more obscure titles. Any investment by the council should surely be aimed at the local film societies and small businesses that are already contributing to our town’s community of culture.\nAnother claim is that the Odeon in Southend is not up to standard, and a brand new luxury cinema would draw in audiences.\nAgain, I find this hard to understand. Personally I think our Odeon’s inviting entrance, a wide-open lobby that lets you see up to several floors, is more architecturally interesting than most cinema foyers. Personal opinion aside, Odeon have invested considerable money and time into keeping the front of house space modern and relevant, recently leading to a complete redesign of the front of house area and swapping out the box office for digital ticket booths. Behind the scenes, I know that the projectors and screens are under constant review and are regularly updated with the latest technology, meaning that even a brand new cinema could not exceed the image and sound quality that Odeon already provides. In fact, most people’s biggest criticism of our current cinema is the cost of tickets. However, with the EMPIRE Seaway cinema claiming to be ‘state of the art’, it’s hard to imagine they will provide a more affordable option than the cinemas we already have.\nIn fact, the only compelling argument in favour of the unpopular Seaway proposals is that the council has already committed £3million of tax-payers money into planning it, and would have to refund the government if it were to cancel the project. Although it would be a shame to waste this money, it’s just a fraction of the proposed cost, especially when you take into account what we stand to lose; our existing cinema, hundreds of car parking spaces on the seafront, and if local business owners are to be believed – dozens more shops and cafes from an already suffering High Street.\nI can, however, see why the council is tempted by this project.\nThey are worried that Southend High Street can’t compete with big shopping centres and cinemas elsewhere in Essex or even London. Developers have taken advantage of this fear before.\nIn 2008 the Victoria Plaza was given a complete refurbishment and renamed the Victoria Shopping Centre in a bid to save our High Street. This project cost £25million and, 12 years later, half the shops inside are still empty. It has all the things that the Seaway project is proposing – a variety of shops and restaurants right in the heart of Southend with a cinema next door.\nI wonder if in another 12 years’ time the Seaway complex will be half empty and the council will be proposing another massive investment to ‘save the High Street’.\nThe Victoria Shopping Centre not only serves as a warning against the Seaway project, but I think it may also be the solution to the problem that Seaway claims it will resolve; We have the empty shops and there’s already a great cinema right there – all the council needs to do is find a way to populate the Victoria Centre with businesses.\nDo that, and our beach can keep its car park and Southend can keep its cinema.\nFurther Reading:\nhttps://www.essexlive.news/news/essex-news/50m-plans-southend-seas-seaway-3918523\nhttps://www.greenandpartners.co.uk/investment/victoria-shopping-centre-southend-7630/",

  "https_southeastessex_greenparty_org_uk_/https_southeastessex_greenparty_org_uk_news_2018_02_27_seegp-concerns-over-local-homelessness/content_314.html": "UPDATE:\nOn 12th November 2018, Simon Cross spoke with BBC Essex about the Homelessness crisis in Southend.\nRead the original article below:\nSouthend has the eighth highest number of homeless people in the UK.\nThis is unacceptable.\nWith the recent cold weather, we question if enough action being taken on this issue locally?\nWhile some people are having to sleep on the snow-covered streets, there is an unquantified number of properties across the borough sitting empty.\nOur Research:\nOver the last few months, we have submitted several Freedom of Information requests to Southend Borough Council with regards to its’ Homelessness provision.\nSouthend Borough Council collected a Council Tax premium on 235 empty properties amounting to over £475,000 in 2016/17.\nThis means that the council is aware of at least 235 empty properties across Southend, but many Southend residents tell us that this number is much higher.\nHowever, it is concerning to learn that while the council is collecting these extra funds on empty properties, a further FOI request has revealed in the last five years, Southend Borough Council has not executed a single Empty Dwelling Management Order*, with the council’s own role of Empty Homes Officer sitting unfilled for more than a year.\n*Empty Dwelling Management Orders (EDMOs) are a legal device used in England & Wales which enable local authorities to put an unoccupied property back into use as housing.\nWhy are these EDMO’s not being executed in the borough? Could more be done?\nThe Charities, Church Groups, and an army of volunteers across the borough have to be commended for all they do to alleviate the situation locally, especially in their efforts over the winter period in running the Winter Night Shelter to help keep the homeless off our streets in the bad winter weather.\nWhile Southend Borough Council acknowledges there is an issue here, recently announcing a one-off investment of £75,000 to help combat and support the prevention of homelessness, disappointingly a further Freedom of Information request revealed that for 2017/18, the council donated just £3,480 to the entire Winter Night Shelter program.\nThis would appear to be a paltry amount considering the large reliance on the continued work form the voluntary sector.\nSouthend Council has regularly failed to address it’s own inaction regarding homelessness, regularly claiming that authorities from outside the borough are paying for one-way rail tickets, and sending their residents to Southend for emergency provision.\nWe issued a number of FOI’s to Southend Borough Council alongside a selection of London Borough Councils with the aim of establishing how many people from outside the Borough have been offered social housing properties in Southend Borough Council properties within the last five years.\nThe responses received reported zero residents being relocated into the borough; although one authority did not hold the information required in its own records, and another has flatly failed to respond.\nWith the Borough’s Social Housing list estimated to have 2,500 people awaiting homes (which almost certainly excludes those sleeping rough on our streets), could more be done to match those in need with empty homes?\nFor those that do find themselves homeless, the Council’s own website offers advice for what to do. You will need to have access to the internet and be able to spend 10-15 minutes completing the Southend Borough Council Housing Options Wizard.\nEven for those that are deemed a priority, it is expected they have completed the Housing Options Wizard before contacting the council in person.\nGiven that the only public no-cost walk-in internet access provision (The Public Library) requires a permanent address to register, how are Southend’s homeless expected to access this online service?\nThe council website also states “Please be aware that if you don’t have a priority need, we can’t help with accommodation under the homeless legislation”.\nWe believe that the Council needs to take a more proactive role in tackling the borough’s homelessness issues.\nFor too long Southend Council has relied on the efforts of a handful of charities and an army of volunteers to provide an adequate Homelessness provision.\nIn our Local Manifesto for Southend, we detail several actions we would implement to help alleviate the struggles of homelessness:\n- Adopt a “permission to occupy” policy to permit homeless people to occupy derelict buildings until they can be renovated/replaced.\n- Support the development of housing co-ops and co-housing projects.\nWe also believe Southend Council, it’s partners, and affiliates, need to stop treating the homeless like criminals.\nThe aggressive militaristic approach of the Southend BID Street Rangers aided by Police in moving the homeless from the Town Centre does nothing to aid these people.\nWhile it appeases High Street businesses, simply moving these people to where they can no longer be seen does not fix the issue.\nIn a situation where the most vulnerable in our society are literally dying on our streets, more can and needs to be done about it.\nFurther Reading:\nhttp://www.echo-news.co.uk/news/15681491.___Six_homeless_people_have_died_this_year___/",

Visitors will also be encouraged to make donations to the parks they use via contactless payments.“\nOur branch Coordinator, James Vessey-Miller was contacted for comment by the paper:\nFollowing a reported 90% reduction of government contributions to local authority funding in the last decade, it isn’t shocking to see Southend Council try to find new revenue streams to make up for this shortfall in funding for key local services.\nSchemes similar to this for commercial sponsorship of roundabouts across the town have long being normality, so I can see the logic behind these proposals.\nI welcome any increase in budget for the town’s Parks Department, who as guardians of our town’s green spaces will play an increasingly important role in the protection of natural areas and wildlife throughout our town. As the borough starts to feel the effects of climate change and ecological collapse, it is vital that the town’s green spaces are preserved, improved, and expanded if we are to meet the necessary environmental targets.\nI do not believe that relying on visitors to donate to the upkeep of the parks is a responsible idea.\nResidents already pay for the maintenance of our parks and open spaces via Council Tax contributions and other civic charges, and many of our town’s parks already have large groups of volunteers who give their time to help care for their local area. I fear that introducing a donation-upon-entry mentality could set a slippery precedent that could eventually lead to charging residents an admission fee to access their green spaces.\nAccess to green space for every person is a fundamental right that should be protected.\nSuch systemic changes in how the local authority pays for the talented individuals and work involved in our parks’ daily upkeep (like those proposed here) lock-in an inflexible attitude of dwindling budgets for an essential service. Such changes mean that in future, major renovation work to our parks following (increasingly-frequent) damaging storms might first require the corporate financiers to sign off on expenses, which will likely lead to a gradual degradation of our green spaces as sponsors begin to realise how much it costs.\nLocal businesses contributing to the upkeep of our parks as a community donation is to be welcomed, but I would also take issue with local businesses being sold the rights to erect obstructive advertising hoardings or being given the ability to dictate or influence the planning or upkeep of our few remaining green spaces. I would strongly oppose allowing private businesses to demand any say on how public land is managed as an inferred right of sponsorship.\nPublic land should remain in the hands of the town, and should be managed solely by those gardeners, arborists, and wildlife experts who currently look after them, and not by private corporate interests.\nInstead of working to pass the costs of park upkeep onto residents and the business community, the council should instead reevaluate how much of a priority the borough’s green spaces are in its own budgets first. I would like to see the necessary improvements to our parks come from civic funds, not by donations from residents or those businesses interested in corporate sponsorship.\nThe Green Party campaigns for the protection of our town’s natural spaces.\nTackling Climate Change head-on starts at home, and we in Southend need to urgently play our part. Like Brighton, with the kind of dedication and ambition the Greens are known for, seaside towns like ours can become global leaders on environmentalism. We work to achieve this in Southend.\nWhilst the other political parties treat the Climate Emergency merely as a trendy fringe issue, offering woolly and unambitious environmental targets, you know that The Greens view this issue with the seriousness and gravity it deserves, and when elected, you can trust us to instigate the biggest shift in council direction in a century.\nRead more in our What We Stand For section here:\nFurther Reading:\nhttps://www.lgcplus.com/services/environment/park-services-need-500m-funding-boost-05-01-2021/\nhttps://www.unison.org.uk/news/2018/06/budget-cuts-put-parks-need-urgent-attention/",

Imagine if the residents and tourists throwing away all those plastic drink bottles could refill just one bottle from one of Southend’s drinking water fountains? How much would that save the council on rubbish collection in the future?”\nLauren Ekins, Green Party Activist\nCllr Hyde appeared very receptive on the night to the suggestion and stated, “I agree that we must seek out new ways to tackle plastic waste, especially on our seafront. The Council does invest in its operational buildings through the Property Refurbishment Programme and other capital programmes. As part of this the Council will consider where water refill points may be appropriately provided for residents, visitors and staff including seeking funding from external sources where available.”\nGreen City Councillor, Cllr Stuart Allen, welcomes the news;\n“It’s a refreshing idea and I’m happy the portfolio holder is taking the suggestion seriously. Access to drinking water is common in many cities, but Southend is lacking in such provision. There is a clear case for this kind of investment on social and health grounds.

  "https_southeastessex_greenparty_org_uk_/https_southeastessex_greenparty_org_uk_news_2018_09_29_greens-respond-to-proposed-southend-bypass/content_75.html": "A recent article in the Echo (20th September) made mention of a new Southend bypass being “seriously considered” by Southend Council.\nCllr James Courtenay, deputy leader of Southend Council said in the article;\n“To get from Shoebury to Progress Road sometimes times takes as long to get from Progress Road to the M25. We have future housing and businesses like the airport business park but it doesn’t just affect Southend. A new road would need to come off somewhere near to the A130 and go through Castle Point and Rochford and go north of Southend.”\nHe then went on to acknowledge;\n“There would be lots of issues with the relief road like whether it would go through green-belt and how far north it would go. This is why we are looking at 2050.”\nWith the seemingly unanimous support of most Southend residents, Mr Courtenay seems to have hit the nail on the head with a wonderful and potentially election-winning idea…\nOr has he?\nThis is not a new idea.\nThe suggestion of having a Southend Bypass was first considered in the late seventies, with the suggestion resurfacing seriously in 1997 by Teddy Taylor MP, when it was immediately rebuffed by residents, campaign groups, and Rochford District Council who were concerned about the prospect of the associated new housing only adding to the problem.\nIt is a well-documented fact that when these bypass roads are constructed, that huge swathes of housing estates are built to complement, and usually part-finance, the new roads.\nThis is already beeing seen in Leicester, Melton Mowbray, and most infamously, Newbury.\nWith this large increase in housing, the new road built to alleviate traffic ends up becoming congested with the traffic of the new homes and businesses it inadvertently created, not solving anything and only adding to the issue.\nIn a situation where Southend is 65% developed on, (49% over the national average) is building a road encouraging new homes and ultimately, more traffic, really a sustainable solution?\nThe Campaign for Better Transport lists many reasons as to why Bypass schemes usually don’t work:\n- Bypasses often don’t remove traffic from the old route, as was the case at the A6 Alverston Bypass and A1(M) Wetherby road. The less-used ‘old route’ usually becomes a favoured alternative to the new road, conversely adding to the traffic along the existing route.\n- Bypasses just move the issue of congestion along a few miles, as was the case at the A6 Great Glen Bypass and the A650 Bingley Relief Road, where neighbouring towns suddenly developed major traffic issues.\nUltimately, the issue is capacity.\n- You start with a road network struggling to cope with the number of vehicles using it.\n- The conventional opinion is to then build more roads to deal with the increased number of vehicles.\n- With less traffic, people are more likely to drive, and with new housing the number of vehicles on the road increases.\nThis process is called ‘induced traffic.’ - You then have more congested roads than you started with, also compounding other issues like carbon emissions and Air Quality.\nThe Environmental Argument.\nBeyond the simple measure of traffic, there are also many environmental reasons as to why building a bypass around Southend would not be a good idea.\nSouthend struggles with one of the worst Air Quality issues in the country, already exceeding the safe limits recommended by the World Health Organisation. An increased number of cars on our roads would only make that crisis worse.\nAll this within months of the local Tories announcing an ‘Air Quality Plan.’\nThe proposed route connecting the A130 to Shoebury traverses two rivers, would pass near or through five small villages, and crosses nearly 17 kilometres of previously uninterrupted Green Belt and Farmland. Such a massive undertaking comes with significant and potentially costly Environmental impacts and could threaten the biodiversity of the area.\nSouthend has 33% less natural space than the UK average, and even Rochford has 27% less than average.\nOur area is already developed on significantly more than other places in the UK, and we should be fighting to protect what little farmland and green space we have left, not building roads through it.\nThe neighbouring villages would be changed forever, transitioning from idyllic rural outposts to enclaves overshadowed by a noisy and polluting main road.\nThis is all of course without beginning to consider the wider atmospheric impact of encouraging additional petrol-cars driving around, and what impact that will have at a time when we’re already failing to hit our climate change commitments.\nThis is predominantly political posturing.\nCllr Courtenay has a fair amount of weight on his shoulders as the Conservative Council’s Deputy Leader.\nIs it surprising then that he makes grand declarations of intent on such a regular basis?\nHis inference that the revival of a two-decade-old idea of the Southend Bypass would provide the golden-goose solution to a town-wide issue when Conservative support in the town is slipping; is somewhat convenient.\nHis commentary in the Echo is also deliberately vague.\nWith more caveats than a tenancy agreement in London, Courtenay manages to reintroduce the idea of the Bypass as merely something the Council are “looking into” whilst providing no details and the vaguest of timeframes, promising that any proposals would form part of the Council’s ‘2050 Vision’.\nHe says; “We need to work out what we need to do and these things take a long time.”\nSure, James.\nThanks for the clarification.\nWe need a new and radical alternative.\nThe traffic issue plaguing Southend is something that needs urgently addressing. That is not disputed.\nThe current situation has led to residents being regularly exposed to dangerous levels of toxic pollutants and suffering from crippling traffic jams which create traffic chaos around town.\nThe solution to the transport infrastructure in Southend lies in a diversification of transit methods and implementing sustainable transport, not building new roads that will just encourage new homes being built in an already overcrowded area.\nNo large town in the world has ever solved its congestion problems by building more roads.\nUsing London as an example; the city has dealt with its transit issues by creating an integrated and sustainable model, encouraging public transport and physically-active travel, whilst discouraging car use.\nA similar situation can be created in Southend on a much-reduced scale.\n- A refreshed and developed Public Transport system can be introduced including a new Park and Ride scheme that actually works.\n- Encouraging physically-active transport by supporting initiatives, creating more safe cycle lanes connecting the town, and undertaking a public education campaign would reduce the amount of cross-town traffic.\nA new approach to town-wide transit needs to be considered urgently.\nThe previous schemes of widening our roads have not worked, what is to say that this highly-expensive suggestion would?\nBy Cllr Courtenay’s own admission, “we might have automated vehicles by then.”\nWho is to say that these future vehicles aren’t all electric self-driving buses as we’re already seeing suggested in cities around the world?\nLet’s try and avoid a future of buses travelling on near-empty dual carriageways where once pristine fields stood.\nThe Green Party has such a radical plan to develop Southend’s infrastructure and create better transport.\nYou can read our proposals in our Manifesto.\nOur Statement:\n“The South East Essex Green Party have long opposed the prospect of a Rochford Outer Bypass scheme, and we refute and challenge the comments made by Councillor Courtenay in the Echo article of 20th September 2018.\nA bypass to the north of the town would not solve any of the town’s crippling traffic issues and would lead to lead to an inexcusable loss of Green Belt land, the destruction of many neighbouring villages, and an increase in Air Pollution.\nIn light of the substantial amount of evidence proving that this scheme would only detriment our town, we call on Councillor Courtenay and his colleagues to reject their national party’s policy, and re-evaluate their stance in the interests of local people.”\nFurther Reading;\nhttps://www.echo-news.co.uk/news/16889771.southend-could-get-a-bypass/\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-41901294\nhttps://bettertransport.org.uk/roads-nowhere/bypasses-dont-work\nhttps://friendsoftheearth.uk/climate-change/roads-ruin-uks-most-controversial-road-plans",

We’re glad to see the council investigating the available green technologies, and we’re keen to encourage and support the appropriate installation of these technologies in the City’s social housing.\nOur team was grateful to have been given a tour by the project managers and delighted to hear that the City Council has committed the funding for a further 100+ council homes to receive overdue insulation upgrades. We had a robust dialogue with the council’s team; listening to their justifications and ambitions, and offering our industry-specific and academic recommendations on several considerations.\nOur score: Good, but further improvement is possible.\nOur appraisal:\nWe were pleased to see technologies like single-room MVHR (Mechanical Ventilation Heat Recovery) and insulated hot water storage installed within the property. We’re glad to see the council pursuing the correct fabric-first approach, with external thermal insulation and efficient glazing taking priority in its projects. The energy-saving devices are welcome additions, as is the study period in which the house’s performance will be monitored by the project team.\nHowever, the excellent single-room MVHR systems and external insulation installed mean that the conventional radiator heating system is redundant and we feel its installation within the showhome is misleading.\nWe have some reservations about the materials being used in this project; specifically, we’re concerned that many of the materials used are plastics and petrochemical-derived, are high in embodied energy & carbon, and almost all are non-recyclable. The petrochemical-derived polystyrene exterior insulation will also off-gas harmful volatile organic compounds (VOCs). We questioned why various cost-comparable natural and sustainable alternatives were not being used.\nMany of our suggestions cited concerns regarding the maintenance and lifecycle of the devices installed, and the lack of end-of-life consideration for materials used, i.e. non-recyclable waste and electronics. We have suggested the Council take a bio-organic and wood-first approach to materials in future projects, such as timber windows and wood fibre insulation, which has additional carbon sink benefits and sustainable end-of-life built-in. These are however more expensive, so the Council needs to make a value decision on specifying such materials. We say that ethics and value outweigh racing to the bottom on cost, and these decisions will send a clear signal to external stakeholders, residents, and interested parties.\nWe acknowledge that this home features more individual technologies installed than would be necessary for most homes to achieve a better standard of sustainability, but we were surprised to see several conflicting systems installed within the property. We have made recommendations about some devices we consider to be costly and unnecessary which can be omitted from future schemes. In our view, the Greywater recycling system (in this domestic specification and use) is just a gimmick.\nThe inclusion of an (incorrectly installed) Air Source Heat Pump and Solar Photovoltaics offers more questions. In our appraisal, ASHPs are not required for this specification of high-standard thermal retrofits that use nighttime economy energy tariffs for hot water storage and heat recovery ventilation systems. Due to the legacy hip roof, there was not much space on the south-facing pitch to install PV panels, so the contractors also installed them on the north-facing pitch, meaning those units would only perform at 70% efficiency.\nAdditionally, there is no accounting for Passive Solar Gain through the south-facing fenestration, meaning the (now super insulated) home will need energy-intensive active cooling throughout the increasingly warm summers and heatwaves more prevalent due to climate heating. Solar gain is easily rectified with brise-soleil or roller shutters and appropriate tree planting on and off the property.\nThere appears to have been no meaningful discussion about interstitial condensation within the fabric of the building, which in time, could cause serious damp and mould problems.\nWe are disappointed that seemingly little consideration has been given to biodiversity and habitat retention in this project.\nWe’re concerned that whilst the water attenuation devices on show in this property are good in theory, far better natural SuDS alternatives exist, like rainwater attenuation ponds, which also create much-needed habitat supporting biodiversity. We were also frustrated by the project’s focus on installing expensive rainwater attenuation troughs to mitigate the private water company’s ongoing lack of investment in suitable infrastructure, with little consideration for how the water collection could be used to benefit the community and wildlife. With this in mind, we suggested that the council review future garden schemes away from hostile drought-resistant hard landscaping to one that uses collected rainwater to support biodiverse habitats and resilient food growth.\nWe questioned why petrochemical vinyl flooring was used instead of porcelain, cork, or rubber alternatives. Likewise, plasticised acrylic paint was used throughout instead of available organic alternatives. The project featured heavy use of cheap petrochemical-based carpets (that were noticeably off-gassing upstairs) instead of natural coir, hemp or woollen alternatives.\nWe have offered our team’s expertise to the council to inform and improve future projects, and we’re keen to suggest recommendations to make future projects cost-effective and holistically sustainable. We welcome the opportunity to study this project’s data and have offered to independently review and scrutinise the project’s performance over time to ensure ROI in future projects.\nIn review, we feel this project is an excellent first step towards improving the council’s in-house knowledge on retrofitting sustainability, and we welcome the steps being taken towards bettering the civic estate and housing stock. Measures like thermal insulation are an overdue step in improving the efficiency and living conditions of the City’s housing provision.\nWe believe there are missed opportunities and misunderstandings within the project that could be misleading to lay people and that need addressing before further roll-out.\nWe feel that had the project consulted with a wider field of industry experts, ecologists, and environmentalists, this show home could have been delivered to a higher eco standard and been of national significance.\nWe welcome consultation and involvement on future projects of this nature.\nCo-authored by members of the South East Essex Green Party.\nOur team for this article included;\n- Chartered Architectural Technologist (MCIAT) / RIBA Affiliate\nSenior Lecturer Practitioner (Architecture & Planning) - Wildlife Conservation and Ecology Specialist\n- WELL Accredited Professional Interior and Spatial Designer\n- ISO Environmental Compliance Auditor (EMS-14001)",

Our representatives reflect the truly diverse nature of the town, featuring frontline health workers, teachers, businesspeople, and parents in our team this year. As ordinary people ourselves, we know the challenges the town faces as we recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. The Green Party offers new and innovative solutions to many of the town’s problems, but we can only make the change the town needs with your support.\nA full list of our candidates (and short bios) have been published in Our Candidates section.\nWhat We Stand For:\nThese elections are crucially important for so many reasons.\nAs the first election held since 2019, residents across town have the opportunity to vote on a wide range of issues that matter to them. Southend is not exempt from suffering from the national crises in housing, education, and healthcare, and meeting the ever-changing needs of our community is a task made more difficult by having a Local Authority without sufficient vision or determination to make the necessary changes to take us forward.\nOur committed and hardworking volunteers are already hard at work in our communities standing up for residents, winning impossible victories against developers, and fighting to make Southend a better town. Many local families who’ve never previously supported the Greens are pledging support for our vision of change this year.\nWhilst the other political parties treat the Climate Emergency merely as a trendy fringe issue, offering woolly and unambitious environmental targets, you know that The Greens view this issue with the seriousness and gravity it deserves, and when elected, you can trust us to instigate the biggest shift in council direction in a century. Despite every warning light on the dashboard being on, the council continues to ignore climate science and is putting our families at direct risk. Worse still, they’re supporting the big polluters causing this.\nWe will lead a Green Recovery from the pandemic, with practical support for businesses and families struggling to make ends meet, and with the resolve to follow the expert science to take us forward as a town.\nAIR POLLUTION\nAir Pollution in many areas in Southend is already illegally high, exceeding the safe limited as set by the World Health Organisation (WHO). Traffic congestion along the A127 and A130, in addition to the pollution from the Airport, only compounds these issues. Rather than kicking the can along the road by conducting long-term studies as the Conservatives once did, and as the Labour/Liberal/Independent coalition administration is now doing, Greens would introduce radical measures to help alleviate the town’s congestion crisis, and would bring in new controls to ensure clean, breathable air for our town. Clean Air is a right, and our current administration is failing us.\nOUR HIGH STREET\nSmall local businesses and our High Street are struggling. Whilst the Labour party believes the future of our High Street is residential, the Greens stand by our commitment to local business and believe that in order to save our High Street, we should be blockading any out-of-town retail parks that would seal the fate of our ailing high-street. Small cooperatives and businesses should be supported with concessions to business rates, and a full-time indoor fresh food market introduced to support local growers and help promote healthy eating.\nHOUSING FOR ALL\nHousing is at a crisis-level in our town. More families are struggling to make ends meet, and many families are in destitution paying ever-increasing rent amounts each month. The Conservatives and Labour are both lauding the Better Queensway scheme as one answer to our town’s issues, but in reality, there will be insufficient truly affordable homes on the site for local people. We believe a sustainable and affordable housing revolution in our town is required. We need to stop building luxury high-profit commuter homes on Green-belt land and should be building truly-affordable homes on the 50+ brownfield sites across our town, and supporting new housing co-operatives that will make it happen.\nLITTER\nLitter is at epidemic levels across the town; Marine pollution is at such the extent whereby voluntary groups in Southend (including some set up by the Green Party) are out almost every weekend collecting the discarded trash that sullies our wonderful beaches and coastline. Greens would continue to tackle rampant littering and fly-tipping and would seek to support voluntary groups in a community effort to tidy up our town. Other initiatives such as repair cafes, and upcycling groups would also be given funding to help repair and repurpose broken goods and electronics to reduce the amount of waste going to landfill.\nYou can read our full local manifesto in the What We Stand For section.\nVisit the Get Involved section for details on how you can help get Greens elected in Southend.",

While the motion was not debated at this month’s Full Council meeting, Cllr Longstaff’s proposals include tighter scrutiny on tree removals, planting thousands of new trees citywide, and introducing an interactive map for residents —all now under development by the administration.\n“I’m encouraged by the administration’s commitment to my proposals after the inaction by the previous leadership. There’s still work to do, particularly on tree removal oversight which ideally should be brought to Place Scrutiny. Things are now moving in the right direction after years of lobbying, and I look forward to collaborating to enhance our tree canopy for future generations.\n“That said, I will be the first to hold the administration to account if they fail to deliver on these pledges.\n“I’m also glad to see a firm commitment from the leader to finally bring real trees to the High Street. This is a welcome step forward, especially after the Tories’ absurd proposal for fake trees at the last Full Council meeting.”\nCllr Richard Longstaff\nThe Green Party will remain focused in holding the administration to account, championing both social and environmental justice at every step.\n– ENDS –",

  "https_southeastessex_greenparty_org_uk_/https_southeastessex_greenparty_org_uk_manifesto/content_115.html": "The Green Party Manifesto for Southend.\nSkip to Section:\nINTRODUCTION\nOur vision for Southend is of a more equal, compassionate area that protects the vulnerable, provides decent homes, education, and health services for all; and recognises the right of future generations to be protected from the ravages of climate change and environmental degradation.\nThe Green Party Southend Manifesto does not repeat the national Green Party manifesto, nor the policies available on the Party’s website; instead, it complements that material, setting out specific ways we will deliver Green Party policy in this area.\nWe have a clear opportunity to make Southend an area fit for the future, and we genuinely believe that our Manifesto is the most rational, most effective, and most responsible roadmap to becoming the pioneering community we all know it can be. Like Brighton, with the kind of dedication and ambition the Greens are known for, seaside cities like ours can become global leaders. We will achieve this in Southend.\nSouthend is not exempt from suffering from the national crises in housing, education, and healthcare, and meeting the ever-changing needs of our community is a task made more difficult by having a Local Authority without sufficient vision or determination to make the necessary changes to take us forward.\nThe Greens have been ceaselessly campaigning for better town planning in our borough for decades, winning against monstrous projects like the proposed Cliffslip Museum, which was dropped in 2018 thanks to our community-led campaign. Additionally, the Greens have been pivotal in organising and supporting community causes throughout the borough – from the mass demonstrations against the downgrading of our NHS services to the campaign to hold the Airport to account over needless and disruptive night flights; all causes that succeeded.\nWhen elected, we will bring about a major shift in the direction of our city, and we will deliver the biggest change in council priorities in a century. From major investments in infrastructure to proactive measures to save our High Street – we are ready with the plans to make Southend fit for the future.\nThe power of having “a Green in the room” is incomparable. We hold those in power to account, strive for better city planning, and we stand up for what matters.\nOur elected officials work to secure a fair and socially-responsible taxation regime that provides sufficient funding to maintain essential public services, including social care for the elderly and the disabled, and an excellent education system for every student.\nOur elected officials are open and progressive, financially responsible, and answerable to local residents. Genuine consultation will always take place before decision making, with an end to the secrecy that has dogged Local Government for decades.\nIn reading this, you’ve already taken the first step in finding out what our city could be.\nSouthend is ready for Better.\nWith your support, we can make that happen.\nFOREWORD\nBy James Vessey-Miller, Coordinator of the South East Essex Green Party.\nThe Green Party has been the fastest-growing political movement in Southend for some time. At every election, our simple messages of social and environmental justice have resonated with more voters in Southend. Broken promises and inaction on big issues have left many residents across Southend tired of the same old story from Labour and the Tories.\nIn 2023, we won our first local Green Party City Councillor with Richard Longstaff in Leigh. As we look to the coming election, we anticipate winning further Green representation in more acres across the City.\nOur committed and hardworking volunteers are already hard at work in our communities standing up for residents, winning impossible victories against developers, and fighting to make Southend a better city. Many local families who’ve never previously supported the Greens are pledging support for our vision of change.\nWhen elected, residents will know that their vote was well-placed in trusting the Greens. Our long-overdue overhaul of the council will reshape our city almost overnight, securing more jobs, better homes, and the best education for every student, and will make Southend-on-Sea a shining example of what a modern and sustainable city can look like.\nOur Green Councillors and MPs are not whipped by the central Party line like others, and as such we are free to make informed and balanced decisions on local issues. We will always act in the best interests of our beloved city and the environment, and you can trust us to put partisan politics aside to follow science and expert advice in securing a fairer and cleaner city to benefit everyone.\nI’m proud that this Green Party Southend Manifesto – the culmination of our continued years of listening to and working for the people of Southend – truly represents the inspiring vision that the Greens offer. Whilst other political parties busy themselves with needless and time-wasting infighting, we’ve already been delivering results.\nOur city needs a new direction.\nWe’re ready to take Southend into the modern era.\nIn this manifesto, The Green Party are proud to present our plan to take Southend forward.\nIf you have any further questions on the Green Party Southend Manifesto or any other queries, please do get in touch.\nA full record of the Green Party’s national policies can be found on the Green Policy website.\nBetter Housing & Ending Homelessness\nAs a modern and forward-thinking area, we have the responsibility to look after the most vulnerable in our city and to build affordable and sustainable housing for local people, not for affluent property investors.\nFor too long, Southend has seen sprawling low-quality high-profit developments built for investors, not our residents, and at a time when Southend has the eighth-highest number of homeless people in the UK, and one of the worst social housing crises in the country, an urgent change in direction is required.\nWe will lead a dynamic change of council effort, away from the provision of high-profit luxury homes and apartments, to the creation of genuinely affordable and sustainable homes and new social-to-rent homes for our residents. We will lead the way in making sure all Southend’s residents have a safe, warm, and efficient place to call home.\nWe will continue our resolve in challenging unacceptable developments of high-cost and small-space homes, and we will continue to defend against gentrification. We will protect our High Street by standing against the conversion of commercial space into residential units, and we will seek to bring empty residential homes back into use using the council’s own underused Empty Dwelling Management Order powers.\nWe will empower private sector rent tenants across the city by supporting a compulsory landlord licensing scheme, and by instigating and supporting new housing cooperatives and tenants unions. We will protect our city’s historic buildings against unnecessary demolition, and we will open Southend as a friendly and welcoming place for refugees and people seeking asylum.\nWe will;\n- Support the renovation and/or construction of new high-quality, well-insulated, spacious flats in central Southend close to public transport hubs or along public transport corridors;\n- Introduce a speedy and effective strategy to bring back into use empty private sector homes using the Council’s own underused Empty Dwelling Management Order (EDMO) powers;\n- Continue the compulsory purchase of empty dwellings across the borough, to be renovated and put into immediate use as social housing;\n- Fund a 24/7 365-night shelter service for the Homeless, supplementing privately run, temporary, and emergency accommodation with an affordable, and reliable council-owned provision;\n- Adopt a “Housing First” programme of unconditional support for rough sleepers;\n- Adopt a “Permission to Occupy” scheme to permit homeless people to occupy unoccupied or derelict buildings until they are needed or can be renovated/replaced;\n- Support the development of local not-for-profit housing co-operatives and co-housing projects;\n- Protect against commercial units in the High Street being converted into residential units;\n- Give social housing tenants greater control over the management of their homes and neighbourhoods with the creation of new local Tenants’ Unions;\n- Improve the quality of housing stock to help reduce household bills with energy efficiency upgrades, insulation, and water-saving devices;\n- Work to ensure that all housing built within the borough meets the various needs of those with physical, hidden, and learning disabilities;\n- Support the South East Alliance of Landlords (SEAL) scheme, extend the compulsory Landlord licensing scheme to encompass the whole city, and aggressively pursue bad landlords using the full force of council powers;\n- Work to improve conditions in sheltered housing schemes; work with local care and repair agencies to make the best use of disabled facilities grants, and help older people access grants and loans to make their homes more energy-efficient and reduce winter deaths;\n- Oppose subdividing houses into multi-occupancy flats; except where an unusually large property is to be subdivided and where the flats will make comfortable dwellings;\n- Refuse to evict council tenants in rent arrears arising solely from the Bedroom Tax or complications with Universal Credit;\n- Lobby central government to properly fund the Staying Put programme for 18-year-olds leaving care;\n- Oppose “right to buy” legislation being extended to housing associations;\n- Prioritise the re-use of buildings of local significance in the first instance, rather than allow their demolition;\n- Conduct an audit of the city’s Locally Listed Buildings, seeking to include a full list of buildings of architectural or historic interest, and work to enable heritage and conservation groups to make use of appropriate available funding;\n- Develop a local asylum policy to welcome, settle and integrate refugees and asylum seekers;\n- Protect Green Belt land and green spaces from development, focussing development on brownfield sites;\n- Restrict the conversion and spread of short-term holiday-let homes or AirBnB property development;\n- Explicitly prioritise denser housing developments on brownfield land with the development of about 100 dwellings per hectare (a similar density to Kuursal ward) to bring new sustainable homes and jobs to existing underused sites; and\n- Introduce a Southend Traveller Strategy to reduce instances of unauthorised encampments across the borough and to better meet the Local Authority’s statutory obligations in respect of creating a mixed community. We would identify and create a designated and fully funded ‘Transit Site’ for Gypsies, Roma, and Traveller communities. Such a site would be accessible to visiting traveller communities, permitting temporary occupation for individuals on the site for no longer than 28 days. This would reduce the impact unauthorised encampments have on the wider settled community and would assist in reducing the national shortage of authorised traveller sites.\nA Green Energy Revolution\nWhile it might not be a priority in the opinions of other political parties, we think Southend has the capacity to be a pioneer in renewable energy implementation. The clear advantages, both financially and socially, now make these schemes not only commercially viable options but in fact also a civic responsibility.\nOur Manifesto sets out clear goals for how we would take the urgent steps in making Southend Borough self-sufficient in terms of energy consumption, and how through a commitment to unprecedented investment, we will ensure that Southend is ready for the low carbon future that will be demanded of us.\nWe support the not-for-profit ‘Southend Energy Company’ and encourage the promotion of renewable energy switching as part of that scheme. We will seek and support the construction of a new appropriately-located wind farm to the north of the city, we will aggressively pursue the installation of other environmentally conscious green energy generation technologies throughout the city, whilst reducing inefficiency, and championing large-scale decarbonisation and fossil fuel divestment.\nWe will:\n- Aim for net energy independence by 2025 by financing and installing large-scale renewable energy generation technologies across the borough, and by encouraging the uptake of such technologies by residents and businesses;\n- Vigorously promote and install Solar Photovoltaic (PV) technologies, using the roofs of all civic buildings and schools;\n- Install Solar PV, small wind turbines, and energy storage devices along Southend Pier, generating surplus power for local seafront businesses;\n- Encourage business and private residents to install Solar PV, solar-thermal panels, ground and air source heat pumps, biomass boilers, and other renewable technologies;\n- Ensure all new residential and commercial structures meet the highest thermal insulation targets, and ensure that all new large developments built in the borough are zero-carbon;\n- Investigate the viability of implementing wind-based electricity generation technologies along our busiest roads;\n- Deliver higher energy conservation standards in new and existing buildings – domestic, commercial, and industrial;\n- Vigorously promote energy efficiency in both private and public premises, including the continuation of the rollout of LED technology for street lighting utilising modern low-blue lighting;\n- Seek the creation of a ‘Green New Deal’ scheme to make homes more energy and thermally efficient;\n- Implement a noise insulation programme for those living on the Southend Airport flight path;\n- Oppose the development of (or any nuclear use of) the Bradwell Nuclear Power Plant and any proposal for a nuclear waste dump in Essex; and;\n- Oppose the Underground Coal Gasification (UCG) site in the Thames Estuary.\nSustainable Infrastructure & Better Transport\nThe time has come to completely overhaul cross-city transit for Southend for the modern era. Council transit policy has historically encouraged the use of the private car, causing an air quality crisis in our city, and wasting £Millions of public money on road widening/construction schemes that can never tackle ever-growing congestion.\nNo large town in the world has ever solved its congestion problems by building new roads.\nThe scale of council failure has resulted in families across town being regularly exposed to dangerous levels of toxic pollutants and illegally-poor Air Quality; a problem for which the Council has not yet come up with an adequate resolution to. Bus use across the city remains low compared to other cities, and the mishmash, disjointed, and dangerous cycle routes and infrastructure across the city actively discourage the borough’s many would-be cyclists.\nIt is evident from experience that only the Green Party can be trusted to deliver the radical measures needed to solve our traffic nightmares and to implement a financially and environmentally responsible solution that works in everyone’s interests, delivering the much-needed investment in low-carbon transport infrastructure our city needs.\nWe commit to completely overhauling our patchy and unreliable bus networks through greater partnership with the borough’s bus operators, and we will deliver unprecedented investment into cycling infrastructure, with new routes and street furniture, allowing for the swift and clean cross-city transit that our residents deserve.\nWe will additionally aid our city’s taxi fleet to modernise, investigating council-backed grants for local taxi firms to invest in new green electric vehicles, giving city-centre priority to electric taxis with newly designated ranks, and additionally making disability awareness training mandatory for our city’s taxi drivers.\nWe will:\n- Develop a new and ambitious Integrated Transport Plan, increasing the provision, reliability and affordability of Public Transport services;\n- Bring our local Bus services back under direct council control, by introducing a new regulated franchising system for bus operators within Southend;

we are living in a Climate Emergency, and without urgent and drastic changes to our way of life, our civilisation faces an existential threat. Entire ecological collapse is not only imminent, but we’re already witnessing it happen. We don’t have long to act before the worst-case scenario will become inescapable.\nAs Greta Thunberg so famously said; “I want you to act as if our house is on fire. Because it is.”\nWe can meet the demands of this unprecedented emergency, however; tackling Climate Change head-on starts at home, and we in Southend need to urgently play our part. Like Brighton, with the kind of dedication and ambition the Greens are known for, seaside cities like ours can become global leaders on environmentalism. We will achieve this in Southend.\nWhilst the other political parties treat the Climate Emergency merely as a trendy fringe issue, offering woolly and unambitious environmental targets, you know that The Greens view this issue with the seriousness and gravity it deserves, and when elected, you can trust us to instigate the biggest shift in council direction in a century.\nWe will:\n- Seek to create a new cabinet member for the Climate Emergency, whose portfolio would encompass emergency decarbonisation measures across the borough, spearheading education and awareness campaigns on climate change, and strategic planning against severe natural events and food scarcity;\n- Convene a Community Climate Change Forum, in which residents and other stakeholders will be consulted on the authority’s Climate action, and can help shape and drive the council’s policy direction;\n- Replace the council’s existing Tree Management Strategy with a more aggressive and urgent Tree Planting Initiative, seeking to dramatically increase the canopy coverage of the borough through securing funding for increasing the number of street trees, creating new green spaces, and re-greening areas where trees were removed for highways works or construction.\n- Protect the city’s street trees by issuing all trees within the borough Tree Preservation Orders (TPO), making it more difficult to remove street trees for spurious reasons;\n- Introduce an independent Tree Review Panel, which will allow for greater independent community scrutiny of trees earmarked for removal;\n- Use the Capital Asset Value for Amenity Trees (CAVAT) model in the valuation of trees within the city, recognising the monetary and wider amenity value of our tree stock in management decisions;\n- Protect and enhance our internationally important natural areas, preserve biodiversity and natural ecosystems;\n- Install permanent air quality monitoring systems throughout Southend, to monitor the prevalence of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), Nitrogen Oxides (NOx), and Particulate Matter (PM2) air pollutants, and use this data to inform a new evidence-based Air Quality action plan.\n- Push for the creation of new Green corridors across the city, allowing the natural transit of wildlife through the borough;\n- Develop a local food production plan, encouraging a local trade of groceries, similar to the CPRE model;\n- Ban Council use of environmentally harmful weed-killing chemicals, and non-recyclable materials (including black plastic pots) seeking a future agreement for a Borough-wide ban;\n- Establish a network of community gardens and green spaces accessible for every resident;\n- Support the existing allotments within the borough, and seek opportunities to create more;\n- Encourage the incorporation of new trees, wildflower beds, and green spaces into city infrastructure design;\n- Develop a new Humane Wildlife Deterrent Strategy (pest control) which is cheaper and more effective than traditional lethal methods;\n- Implement several rainwater collection points for street cleaning and for usage at allotments;\n- Encourage street planting, and support the creation of community-owned micro gardens and pocket parks;\n- Endeavour to achieve the highest standards of animal welfare in council catering establishments and beyond, using seasonal and local produce wherever possible to promote low carbon food consumption; including Vegetarian/Vegan catering as standard at council events;\n- Support Environmental Groups in the improvement and maintenance of natural spaces and parkland;\n- Investigate and install appropriate flood defence infrastructure to safeguard high flood-risk areas from climate change-related sea-level rise;\n- Develop a high-standard Bee Strategy to protect pollinators, supporting the EU ban on neonicotinoid pesticides;\n- Reduce cutting of seasonal wildflowers and meadows to protect wildlife;\n- Combat the discharge of sewage into the Thames Estuary by the water companies, and seek legal protection for the Thames Marine Environment, recognising its important ecological contribution;\n- Address the threats to the Thames Fishing industry, additionally seeking to work with Environmental Health Officers to tackle the practice of illegal shellfish harvesting within the estuary; and\n- Oppose the expansion of the Sea Life Centre, and work to reduce the number of animals kept in captivity.\nYoung People & Quality Education\nHaving an environment that facilitates healthy learning and personal development is the most important thing in young people’s lives. Ensuring a curriculum and testing system within education settings that suit the individual needs of every child is paramount.\nThe Greens continue to push for the highest standards in education, opposing the academies schemes and the two-tier education system failing Southend’s students. The grammar schools are part of the reason for that failure, and so we oppose selective education. Our Manifesto ensures that all students receive the best possible education possible, and we will ensure that no child is ever left behind or disadvantaged because of a selective education system.\nWe would ensure the proper funding and staffing of our libraries, and we would work to ensure that neighbourhoods surrounding schools are safe enough for our children to walk or cycle to school.\nWe welcome Further and Higher Education students choosing to study in our city, and we want to ensure that their student experience in Southend is the best it can be. Additionally, we support wider moves to a lifelong learning approach, enabling residents to access education and retraining initiatives at any stage in life, regardless of income or employment status.\nWe will:\n- Work with our Higher Education (HE) and Further Education (FE) universities and colleges to invest in lifelong learning approaches, developing Southend as a centre for innovation and educational excellence;\n- Oppose the conversion of primary and secondary schools into academies, and seek to bring all schools within the city back under Local Authority control, removing the two-tier education structure;\n- Support moves towards less reliance on fixed curriculum teaching and testing to allow Headteachers more flexibility;\n- Work to improve the experience of being a Higher Education Student in Southend: improving private-sector student accommodation through Landlord licensing and new Tenants Unions; improving social and mental health support for students with new Student-specific outreach and support programmes; and by supplementing HE Institutions’ existing welfare structures;\n- Support the independence of FE & HE Students’ Unions (SU), by allowing SU’s to hire council-owned facilities for events for free, and by improving collaborative working between the authority and Students’ Unions;\n- Support the work of the Southend Youth Council and Youth Parliament, and seek to consult these organisations when practicable on all civic matters that affect Young People;\n- Speed improvements to school buildings to higher standards of comfort, space, and energy conservation;\n- Effectively reduce shortages in education staffing with retraining and upskilling initiatives, and by seeking to support those in teacher training;\n- Invest in our Public Libraries, ensuring that even small branches such as Southchurch Library remain open and staffed properly full-time for the public to use;\n- Improve the provision for children and young people with Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND), and work to facilitate a joined-up approach to making third-sector provision work with that of the local authority;\n- Develop libraries as integral community hubs where people can access a wide range of community and third-sector services;\n- Seek to finance and open new dedicated full-time Youth Centres (using existing civic buildings if necessary), restoring the city’s Youth Services that have been lost to council cutbacks;\n- Implement the suggestions made by the Southend Youth Council’s 1757 Voices Charter, to better the Mental Health and well-being of local students;\n- Speed up the phase-out of all remaining demountable classrooms;\n- Introduce 20 mph zones surrounding all schools;\n- Introduce School Streets schemes, prohibiting vehicular access to streets surrounding schools at school drop off and pick up times;\n- Develop an integrated and fair school transport system to reduce congestion caused by the “school run” giving parents and pupils information to encourage sustainable travel to school, aiming for all children who are able to walk or cycle safely to their local school;\n- Support schools in achieving eco-school and ‘Solar School’ status;\n- Support primary and secondary schools in achieving the Arts Council’s Artsmark Gold standard;\n- Create a scheme where every child in the borough receives free bicycle proficiency training;\nImplement the creation of Environmentally-Conscious education schemes in all schools; - Seek to implement a 400m fast food outlet exclusion zone around schools;\n- Ensure materials relating to LGBTIQA+ history is made available to all education practitioners and at every library in the borough;\n- Ensure materials such as “Decolonise the Curriculum” and “The Black Curriculum” are made available at every library in the Borough and support local schools in diversifying their curriculum to teach diverse and representative history;\n- Create a dedicated Outdoor Learning Centre to educate school children on the environment;\n- Improve school dinners with more locally-produced organic food and fresh fruit & veg; and\n- Promote the Sure Start programme.\nCrime & Antisocial Behaviour\nWe believe that Southend’s vibrant diversity of businesses, voluntary organisations, community groups, schools, and religious organisations play a key role in the safety and identity of our community. Local Policing effort already works closely with these communities in identifying and responding to issues, but we believe the adoption of new approaches and attitudes by Police and community teams will yield untold additional advantages.\nWe believe in tackling drug use in Southend as a health and social issue rather than simply a criminal one. Greens believe in cohesive working between community outreach teams, youth services, social services, and police, following a model of reducing wider civic harm caused by unregulated drug use. This is especially required given the recent prevalence of the complicated County Lines issue, where organised criminal gangs often target disadvantaged local youths, grooming them into dangerous circles of violent antisocial behaviour and community harm. Adopting this new approach could be the key to breaking this cycle of harm.\nWe believe that the recent increases in youth-perpetrated antisocial behaviour are partly linked to the callous, irresponsible, and almost total reduction in funding for youth centres and civic schemes for our city’s young people. We believe that a holistic approach to reintroducing the Authority’s youth outreach work, combined with a renewed effort to enrol our young adults into meaningful community volunteering and apprenticeships might be another significant step towards tackling this problem.\nWe continue to advocate for a restorative justice system. Greens believe that by working in partnership with police and residents, at the same time as improving the life chances and opportunities of potential offenders, we can reduce crime and anti-social behaviour.\nWe will:\n- Improve the quality and monitoring of the borough-wide CCTV network, prioritising major junctions and places of high footfall, and seeking to introduce temporary CCTV systems in areas of repeated antisocial behaviour;\n- Pursue measures to tackle vehicular antisocial behaviour, seeking to crack down on litter, noise, dangerous driving, and speeding offences associated with unauthorised car events;\n- Instigate measures to adopt an approach of treating drug use as a social and health issue, working to enable and equip communities and outreach teams, and to transition from a punitive criminal approach to prioritising a reduction in civic harm;\n- Working closely with community police and outreach teams, develop a combined strategy of proactive (rather than reactive) community-informed local policing, seeking to use preventative and restorative methods of dealing with crime to engage and deter would-be offenders before the crime and antisocial behaviour is committed;\n- Protect per capita funding for Domestic Abuse programmes, and run an awareness-raising campaign aimed at local employers to promote the needs of domestic abuse survivors;\n- Oppose the rollout of facial recognition technology by the Police in Southend;\nImprove the street lighting coverage in our darkest residential areas; - Review the ill-judged Public Space Protection Order (PSPO) in central Southend, which has been used to needlessly criminalise, harass, and victimise the homeless community;\n- Support the PubWatch scheme and the continued rollout of Southend BID’s ‘Disc’ initiative, which will aid local pubs, bars, and nightclubs in the borough to identify, report, and exclude repeat antisocial offenders;\n- Tackle blue badge fraud and ensure the maximum availability of disabled parking for genuine blue badge holders;\n- Seek to change Council strategy regarding sex workers from a punitive antisocial behaviour approach to holistic community outreach and harm-prevention model, supporting existing services; and\n- Enrol repeat graffiti vandals on restorative community service courses that would see them repaint/clean/repair vandalism-affected surfaces across the borough;\nJobs & The Local Economy\nAs a city with a population surpassing 180,000, we recognise the importance of creating a dynamic local economy that supports sustainable employment and generates long-term investment. We will deliver a more prosperous city by promoting the economic and social benefits of a local, sustainable, and responsible economy.\nSupporting local businesses whilst implementing the principles of a circular economy is a model that not only works but is easily implemented and overdue. We believe in enabling organisations that work in the interests of the wider community, and as such, we will support Community Interest Companies (CICs), Co-operatives, and worker-owned businesses; organisations that in turn, invest in their workforce and their local communities.\nWe will lead by example in the push for wage equality, the rollout of a Living Wage across the city, and by seeking an end to the zero-hours contracts that hamper the upward mobility of our often-overlooked essential and young workers. We support local traders and seek to form new local business opportunities afforded by renewable energy technologies and responsible food production.\nWe will reinvigorate our ailing High Street through investment, by using civic funds to purchase retail units in the High Street, Hamlet Court Road, The Broadway and other shopping arcades and then responsibly lease them to startup businesses; encouraging new local jobs, products, and services. We will defend against plans to weaken our High Street by opposing schemes that seek to convert retail units into homes, and we will staunchly oppose the creation of any more out-of-town retail parks. We will support the creation of a full-time fresh goods market, enabling residents to make healthier and more sustainable food choices at a better price.\nWe will:\n- Introduce the Southend Living Wage, initially seeking to pay all council employees a fair and livable wage of no less than £15 per hour;\n- Investigate the further creation of more affordable workspaces for startups, freelancers, entrepreneurs, and small cooperatives across the borough;\n- Promote the local ecotourism opportunities long neglected by Local Government and business;\n- Create a full-time indoor Fresh Goods Market in Southend High Street, allowing local growers to sell their products;\n- Seek opportunities to bring a small number of commercial units in every shopping arcade into council ownership, allowing the Authority to lease these units to startups and local independent businesses at reduced costs;\n- Support and facilitate sustainable economic development in the borough, working with partners to win external funding for the benefit of local people;\n- Initiate a city-wide crackdown on zero-hours contracts;\n- Support the Southend Connexions service, enabling young people to access support in enrolling on further and higher education courses, and receiving careers and apprenticeship advice;\n- Spread awareness and education to front-line businesses and services to encourage them to challenge prejudice;\n- Improve the fee-free jobs fair, allowing unemployed residents to meet with potential employers and network;\n- Work with local ethical banks, mutual savings societies, and credit unions to expand start-up or expansion loans for co-operatives and ethical CICs; and explore the possibility of more affordable capital lending via a Council-backed community credit union;\n- Reduce the fees and rental costs of hiring out council-owned facilities, to encourage community groups of civic value to be set up;\n- Support organisers seeking to bring sustainable public events to the borough;\n- Create an Eco Business Centre, showcasing and supporting startup local green businesses;\n- Seek to continue the full borough-wide roll-out of full-fibre gigabit internet connectivity, and ensure that every home across Southend has an internet connection fit for the modern era, additionally allowing a greater number of people to work from home;\n- Support independent traders, seeking ways to reduce the business rates burden upon small traders, and seek to support local environmentally conscious businesses with a range of further small business rates relief measures;\n- Develop a local Circular Economy, encouraging residents to purchase from local traders;\n- Oppose the Seaway Development;\n- Oppose the Fossetts Farm Development; and\n- Oppose any development of the Southend Cliffs.\nLeisure, Health, & Culture\nWe recognise the responsibility Local Government has in ensuring a well and fit community, and we will work to ensure that every resident has access to good and free health and leisure provisions. We will guarantee this by working to bring the leisure facilities across the borough back into direct council ownership and control, and we will seek to make access to the town’s swimming pools and other leisure facilities free of charge for all local residents.\nOur Green Party Southend Manifesto puts individuals’ health and well-being first, and we have a strategy to ensure that our city is healthy. We will strive to deliver a substantial investment into the health of residents, working with the NHS and public health professionals across the city to improve access to mental health care, ensuring a commitment to maintain and improve our outdoor leisure and play spaces, and by actively working to improve the water quality at our beaches.\nSouthend hosts one of the most vibrant and thriving artistic communities in East Anglia, and our wealth of talented artists, writers, and musicians not only significantly contribute to the overall identity and well-being of the city, but additionally attract inward investment into the borough. We will support our flourishing networks of creatives by introducing a number of small bursaries for locally-derived cultural contributions and public-realm artworks, and we will aid our local artists in securing external grants, investments, and commissions.\nWe reaffirm our support for facilitating sustainable growth in our city’s vital nighttime economy. We will develop a borough-wide Pub & Nightlife strategy to work closely with our live music venues, independent pubs, and nightclubs to facilitate long-term continuity and sustainable development in an under-supported sector; and we will work to help new bars, cafes, and restaurants set up in our city by rejuvenating our shopping areas through investing in expanding the number of retail units within the council’s own property portfolio leased to local businesses at reduced rates.\nWe will:\n- Work to ensure the complete retention of NHS services at Southend Hospital and the surrounding area.\n- Resist cuts to our National Health Service, and call providers to account for lengthening waiting times;\n- Support funding for better Sexual Health services locally, seeking to reverse privatisation, working to improve access to quality sexual healthcare, education, and contraception, and to reduce rates of sexually-transmitted infections;\n- Strive to bring Leisure and sports facilities back under local authority control, seeking to immediately introduce free of-charge access to Southend’s swimming pools and leisure facilities for all residents;\n- Press for quality mental crisis care to be available 24/7, and seek to create Mental Health drop-in sessions at community libraries;\n- Introduce a number of small bursaries for local artists to create public-realm artworks and cultural contributions to improve the street scene across the borough;\n- Encourage healthy lifestyles with improved Green Spaces, and better sports and leisure amenities;\n- Encourage and support more health-related events such as the Southend Half Marathon and cycle events;\n- Ensure all sports and play facilities in public parks remain free of charge and accessible to all residents;\n- Ensure that all parks and open spaces across the borough remain designated as ‘open access land’ under the Countryside Rights of Way Act;\n- Develop Safe Play strategies for children, with safer roads and parks;\n- Introduce monitoring and seek to improve the water quality of the Thames Estuary;\n- Continue to support public city-centre events such as Southend Pride, and the wide array of Southend BID events;\n- Seek to support popular Live Music events such as Leigh Folk Festival, and investigate measures to bring back a free-entry live music festival in Chalkwell Park;\n- Support and financially assist the development of a city-centre Arts & Culture cooperative hub;\n- Ensure that buildings and heritage assets owned by the council, (such as Southend Pier) are not sold to private firms or developers for corporate gain, and are kept as community assets for the city;\n- Seek to bring privately owned (or leased) heritage assets in the city (i.e. The Kursaal) back into local authority ownership, to safeguard the buildings against irresponsible development and/or ruin, and put them to good community use;\n- Recognising the huge benefits of a vibrant evening and nighttime leisure and cultural economy, we would develop a Pub & Nightlife strategy aimed at supporting local Live Music venues, independent pubs, and nightclubs;\nEnsure that the city’s Association of Town and City Management (ATCM) Purple Flag accreditation is protected and improved upon; - Ensure footpaths, bridleways, and public rights of way are properly maintained and safeguarded; and;\n- Work to ensure that, where possible, large events provide added value to the community, including encouraging the use of local suppliers.\nA Responsible Waste Strategy\nSouthend has consistently missed agreed recycling targets, and despite households across the city doing their part to help solve this issue, almost half of all waste generated by the borough is still not recycled. That is not sustainable, and the environmental impacts of landfilling and incineration are inexcusable. The solution is developing an efficient system for the better reuse, upcycling, and recycling of materials and this is the next step on our journey to a Zero Waste society.\nOur Green Party Southend Manifesto recognises the urgent need to change the way in which we treat used materials, and reevaluate and reconsider our wasteful ways. Southend should be a model for a different way of working in which the maximum possible quantity of redundant materials is re-used or recycled.\nWe commit to significant investment into combating waste in our city. To fight the plastic bottle litter that plagues our lovely beaches, we will install new water standpipes across town and the seafront, encouraging residents and visitors to instead adopt using reusable bottles. We will introduce a bottle deposit scheme, a community composting scheme, and we’ll do what we can to stop city-centre businesses using single-use plastics.\nTo tackle the scourge of litter and fly-tipping; we will seek to introduce wheelie bins for every resident to help prevent refuse being strewn across our roads; we will improve the on-street bins; we will support voluntary litter-picking and community cleanup initiatives, and we will aggressively detect and prosecute fly-tipping offenders.\nWe will:\n- Seek to bring the city’s waste management provision in-house, ending the private contract. This direct investment will allow for greater democratic oversight and accountability of performance, and better management of the borough’s waste & recycling services, as well as also improving the working standards and pay of local Waste Collection employees;\n- Seek to dramatically improve recycling rates in Southend, and significantly reduce the amount of waste being generated by the city;\n- Move to an improved stream-separated waste strategy to improve the value of reclaimable recyclables;\n- Combat the number of single-use water bottles used and littered across the borough by seeking the installation of multiple and convenient water bottle refilling stations;\n– at every large park,\n– at intervals along the seafront (with a higher density at the areas surrounding Old Leigh, Chalkwell Beach, Jubilee Beach, and Shoeburyness East Beach),\nand in shopping areas and in all new public realm development schemes; - Introduce a local composting scheme, encouraging the practical distribution and reuse of food waste and garden waste. This will be facilitated by the Council’s Parks Department as a revenue-generating scheme;\n- Investigate the introduction of wheelie bins for every household in the borough that can accommodate them and communal bin stores for those that can’t;\n- Establish a Council-backed community repair and upcycling initiative in schools and public centres;\n- Introduce new and improved public refuse & recycling bins, introducing on-street cardboard and glass recycling bins;\n- Seek the implementation of a ban on the use by commercial retailers of environmentally damaging single-use plastics (such as carrier bags, and takeaway packaging) in the Borough;\n- Promote Greywater recycling, implement natural and sustainable drainage systems (SuDS), and investigate a full range of water recycling storage facilities;\n- Support local voluntary beach cleaning and litter-picking groups in combating litter on our beaches, parks, and streets;\n- Seek to improve free public toilet facilities across the city, especially in Southend High Street, where few exist currently;\n- Aggressively pursue, detect, and prosecute fly-tipping;\n- Lead initiatives to tackle dog-fouling; including the rollout of new dog waste bins, and a publicity campaign to educate dog owners on the damaging environmental effects of plastic bags in a landfill, etc;\n- Create a new council-backed bottle deposit scheme, and create convenient bottle return locations;\n- Encourage local shops to only stock biodegradable or recyclable bags;\n- Initiate a new Natural Nappies programme;\n- Explore the options for a publicity campaign to encourage the use of natural sanitary products, and additionally provide sanitary products free of charge to the homeless; and\n- Oppose any and all incineration of waste including any waste-to-energy (WTE) schemes.\nPolitical Vision & Improvements to Local Democracy\nOur elected Councillors will be open and progressive, financially responsible, and answerable to local residents. Genuine consultation will always take place before decision-making, with a commitment to ending the secrecy that has dogged Local Government for decades.\nWe will seek to create a fairer and more equal council, with the introduction of a high-low pay ratio of no more than 10:1, resulting in a reduction in pay for the most senior members of staff, and a wage increase for our essential council workers. We will lead by example in the rollout of a £15 per hour living wage for all council employees, and by extension council providers via contract negotiations, ensuring people employed by the council, directly and indirectly, are paid a meaningful and livable wage.\nWe will seek to improve the transparency of decisions made by the council, through better utilisation of digital participation tools, and via the introduction of a new email newsletter made available to all residents. We will seek to additionally improve the accessibility and inclusivity of the council by modernising documents, conducting a review into the gender pay gap at the council, and by broadly adopting gender-neutral language. And we will seek to use the council as a vehicle to promote and support local business, by supporting the creation of new local cooperatives and CICs to provide services for the authority.\nWe will;\n- Flatten council structures, reducing the high-low pay ratio to below 10:1 and reducing the number of senior managers;\n- Support local people to create co-operatives or CICs to provide services that the council currently commissions from private companies;\n- Ensure that all regeneration schemes provide social and sustainability benefits;\n- Conduct a review into any disparities in pay between staff of all genders, seeking to ensure that all staff are paid equally for the work they do;\n- Ensure better oversight and close monitoring of all council projects to keep them on time and on budget, seeking to prevent civic funds from being wasted;\n- Review civic participation in Local Government functions, and seek to facilitate improved dialogue between the council and residents on issues that matter to them;\n- Improve the Council’s e-petition service, committing to better acknowledge, fully review, and ensure a timely response to all petitions to the Council;\n- Commit to pushing for a more diverse Council, reviewing employment practices and seeking to embody equal opportunity employer principles;\n- Combat CV discrimination by making anonymised CVs mandatory within the local public sector. This will ensure that candidates are hired based on experience and qualifications and stop candidates from being discriminated against.\n- Seek to improve the inclusivity and accessibility of the authority by; modernising documents, adopting gender-neutral terminology in council documents and meetings, and seeking to include gender-variant options on council forms;\n- We will seek to urgently divest Southend’s investments in the fossil fuel industry made via the Essex Pension Fund which has already invested over £219M into Fossil Fuels;\n- Work with public-sector pension funds to encourage divestment from the fossil fuel industry and other unsustainable and unethical industries; and\n- Assure that the council acknowledges and engages in a greater diversity of cultural and religious celebrations held by groups within the borough.",

  "https_southeastessex_greenparty_org_uk_/https_southeastessex_greenparty_org_uk_news_2015_05_11_the-general-election-blame-game/content_151.html": "Peter Walker\nThe general election result was a disaster. The poor will get poorer, reliance on food banks will rise, deaths through inadequate medical treatment will increase. The Giant Evils of Want, Disease and Ignorance, identified in the Beveridge Report over 70 years ago, and on which our Welfare State was based, are back on the march. These are the direct result of Tory policies and those of us who oppose the Tories must work tirelessly to remove them as soon as possible.\nOne could be forgiven for thinking that with so much at stake, and much of society in decline, an extreme right-wing government riddled with incompetence and corruption ought to have been easy pickings for an aspiring opposition worth its salt. Not so: with so many open goals to score, Labour somehow not only failed to make inroads into the Tories, they even went backwards.\nThere is one lie doing the rounds of the Labour bloggers and that is to blame the Greens for their failure last week. The Greens, they argue, took votes from Labour and allowed the Tories to get back in. The Greens, they argue, should not stand against Labour in the first-past-the-post system.\nSuch arrogance is truly breathtaking. The Labour party does not have a divine right to attract people’s votes. Indeed, where the Labour party shifts its ground so it occupies the right of centre, they are wilfully abandoning the votes of people who understand that the country’s needs can only be addressed by a left-of-centre agenda. It is no coincidence that the Green Party’s byline is “For the Common Good”. We seek the improvement in the quality of life of everyone: not the richest few, as the Tories do, nor the 35% or so somewhere near the middle, which the Labour party was hoping would see them squeaking over the finishing line with a little bit of help from their friends and a dysfunctional electoral system.\nWe want to see the quality of life of everyone in this country – indeed, outside this country as well – improve. We recognise that, first and foremost, the environmental crisis of climate change, which is threatening to sweep away great swathes of the habitable planet, and to which the other parties pay occasional lip service, must be our number one priority. The health of the environment is not a single issue: it transcends all human activity and endeavour and the imperative of damage limitation resulting from climate change must override everything we do. That is for the Common Good.\nHowever, we will also tackle problems that, of themselves, are not – yet – directly the product of Climate Change. The greatest of these is Austerity. The Common Good is not served by a policy of austerity. That way, the poorest and most needy are cast off from our democratic process, and that is a race to the bottom. If the Labour Party chooses to go after the votes of the “aspirational middle class”, as Blair and Mandelson have been urging, then by definition that party is neglecting the most needy – people on benefits through no fault of their own, who are just as likely to be in work as out of it. Furthermore, as austerity bites ever deeper, that aspirational middle class will reduce in number and, electorally speaking, won’t be worth chasing. If that is the way Labour wants to go, then where Scotland has led, the rest of the country will surely follow and the Labour Party is destined to oblivion. Scottish independence is not just independence from England, it is also independence from what Tory – and Labour – England has come to represent: the cult of Big Business dictating to government what it can and can’t do. The privileged few apart, we all want independence from that. We live in one of the wealthiest countries in the world. If we can bail out the banks, then we can surely find our way to alleviate the most pressing needs of the poorest in our society.\nThe Greens are a democratic party. We will defend absolutely our right to contest elections and attack the Tories on as many fronts as we are able. If the Labour Party chooses to condone Tory policies and adopt them, then we will never stand aside for them and say “After you!”. We will attack them as well. We will act as we will always do – For the Common Good.",

I will fight for your NHS, schools, closing the poverty gap and protecting your environment.”\n“The constituents of Rayleigh and Wickford have an excellent opportunity to help stop the carnage that is being inflicted upon us all in the UK. A Green vote is a fairer vote for all and I am determined to fight for our public services and our families’ futures,” said Paul Hill.\nDominic Ellis added “This election is an opportunity to reject the growing right-wing ideology of the political establishment and support a party that puts everyone’s interests first, not just its own.”\nPolitics can be done differently.

Plenty of people rely on the bus to get to work and this increase will only hurt them in their pockets – once again Labour are hitting the most vulnerable hard, rather than looking at other ways to tax those that can afford to pay more. These are political decisions and Labour are making the wrong ones.\n“Like Europe, I believe Government should be subsidising all forms of public transport, especially buses and trains, as this enables greater mobility and less dependence on cars. Increasing fares directly impacts the poorest in society and restricts mobility. It’s a stealth tax on the least well-off when we should be taxing the super wealthy more.”\nCllr Richard Longstaff\nCllr Stuart Allen adds, “The £2 fare cap made the bus an affordable way to get around the city, and we should be actively encouraging as many people to use the bus to reduce traffic on our roads and emissions in our city. Ultimately the increase will put people off from using the bus and will result in more congestion and more dangerous pollution.”\nThe Green Party will be writing to Southend West & Leigh MP, David Burton-Sampson sharing its concerns with the cab increase.\n– ENDS –",

Transpire are such an inclusive group of Trans Activists who hold events like this to help people socialise in Safe Spaces where people are invited to talk freely about everything in the most relaxing form of human contact.\nThe organisers told me that it had been their most successful event to date and I met a complete rainbow of people from every walk of life.\nNo festival in Southend can ever be complete without the Railway Hotel.\nDecked out in the many flags of the community and an amazing rainbow wave, they put on a Disco Night featuring the incredible Sofonda Cox and Electro-Pop high NRG from legendary local duo Marlow. Two floors of the most eclectic and iconic disco and electro which is a mainstay of LGBTIQA+ nightlife. I spent the entire evening drifting from my friends to make lots of new ones and as butterflies do flitting from flower to flower. Saturday night was the proof that this whole week was going to be iconic.\nThe place was packed and I estimated that over 500 people popped in, with most staying right to the end.\nSunday 15th July\nCinema has always played a part in the evolution and the life of the LGBTIQA+ community, and actors have often become activists fighting for the acceptance and equality of a community which has often given so much to entertainment.\nJake Penny and the amazing Kings Road URC Community Church offered themselves as a venue for a Sunday Cinema where we saw two amazing but contrasting films followed by a lively discussion and some great recommendations of things to see.\nThe first film, A Fantastic Woman, is set in Santiago, Chile and centres on a Trans woman who –having had to come to terms with the sudden death of her partner and true love- met with the oppression of a community and family who simply could not fully accept her as his true love. The emotion and the gut shot performance of the central figure was emotional and provoked strong feeling. This film painted a picture of just how difficult Trans life can be at times and how when a person needs support yet so often faces almost universal rejection.\n“We must never let anyone be punished for being themselves or for being in love.”\nThe second film, the Oscar-winning Moonlight, was the story of a young black boy growing up in the shadow of drug culture in Miami and having to cope with his homosexuality and his own coming to terms with and growing into his sexuality in a dark and unaccepting culture. The emotional and sometimes brutal portrayal of how difficult life can be when you have a sexuality which is neither understood or accepted by peers. I had some sense that places I know such as the Yorkshire Mining communities must have been a parallel in this country.\nAround 50 attended for one or both films and we discussed the ideal situation where LGBTIQA+ roles should be offered to those from the community which has been at the forefront of entertainment since someone first played a tune or put on the moxy.\nMonday 16th July\nIndependent Coffee House and PRIDE sponsor Utopia held Proud Poetry on the Monday hosted by one of Southend’s finest poets and writers, Cat Howe.\nI am a bit of a poet myself so I was not going to miss this.\nUtopia and Cat were overwhelmed even before the emotional night started as the people who came to hear LGBTIQA+ poetry had outstripped capacity before a word was spoken in love. I cannot pick any outstanding performances or highlights for two reasons. Firstly the quality was the highest as I have seen in 40 years of visiting poetry events. The second reason is that I, like the host, was crying joyous and supportive tears from the first word until the final chord of a beautiful song by Ren Steadman.\nBetween 100 and 200 people turned out for a showcase of the most accessible and most personal kind of art participation and I urge the community to get out to more spoken word events.\nTuesday 17th July\nOn Tuesday was the under-18’s Mixer organised by Figuring It Out.\nIt was the usual ‘safe space’ inclusive and well-planned event we now expect from Southend Pride and all the reports I had were that this was a fabulous event and one of the real learns for other PRIDE organisers. Inclusionary events for younger people are very much needed as this is a time in life where a lot of Mental Health issues can emerge and just having like-minded and understanding people around can really help stave off some really difficult issues of alienation.\nWednesday 18th July\nThe Park Inn Palace Hotel were fine hosts for this cavalcade of the finest LGBTIQA+ comedy headlined by none other than the runner-up from Britain’s Got Talent, Robert White. Hosted by Ross McGrane from the Southend Comedy Festival, the packed night featured some seriously impressive local LGBTIQA+ comedic talent and it was an absolute blast.\nThursday 19th July\nAnother day another venue.\nThis time yet another event which sends a message to other PRIDE organisers.\nAvenue Baptist Church hosted and opened their doors to an Inclusive Church Service. This was a blessing for Southend Pride. I am reliably informed there were seventeen ministers in attendance and 100+ attended to accept the worship which included a truly heartfelt apology for misunderstandings between the church and the LGBTIQA+ community.\nThis in itself is a real step towards inclusivity.\nI would love in future years, to see all the faiths come together and socialise and worship with all the LGBTIQA+ community.\nFriday 20th July\nJoey Bambino who is such a lively and innovative drag comedian and singer hosted a drag event titled Kings vs. Queens upstairs at the Alex.\nOnce again, a full house and a reminder that we may need bigger venues next year. What was done here was that unlike certain PRIDE events, the Drag and Transgender part of our community came together to do what (IMHO) nobody does better and provide a pure Burlesque entertainment filled with innuendo, sexuality, humour and unabated fun. Once again those who have not stopped smiling all week left in floods of laughter and good tears.\nSaturday 21st July\nThree events and what a day!\nThe venue, Warrior Square Gardens in the heart of the town.\nThe Southend Pride team were on site from 6 AM preparing for what was to be an astonishing day of community togetherness.\nA monumental effort was put in by the crew and all involved, and the festival ground was just about ready for 11.\nAs we left Warrior Square walked down the High Street and turned into Pier Hill, the success was evident.\nFrom the LGBTIQA+ community, the political groups, and the Unions (these events were largely the result of the unswerving support of UNISON) and the other groups – every section of society was there with banners and tonnes of enthusiasm.\nAfter a hula hoop warm up and some speeches from the Mayor, Unison, and Pride crew, we set off.\nThe parade started gently and as we walked the short distance of the High Street, we were joined by more and more beautiful people.\nThe parade swelled to three times its original number and good humour and song was all that could be seen and heard.\nThis could be amongst the largest turnouts for a march in Southend ever.\nPRIDE Festival.\nIt took thirty minutes to check the 1,700 marchers into the venue and it was looking like the estimates that 2,500 would attend were becoming a reality.\nWendy Solomons bedecked in the most beautiful rainbow sequin number opened things up from a stage which was set to see an array of choirs, drag performers, lip sync artists, young performers with joyous confidence, chanteurs and chanteuse’ torch singers and more than a little fun and comedy.\n“The entertainment flowed for over seven hours and the sun shone on the most wonderful event in Southend history.”\nApart from a bit of sun and beer-related overindulgence, security and police experienced a crowd filled with love where they found themselves participants rather than having to intervene. So many times I saw them helping us litter pick, having photos with kids, or dancing.\nIn the end, the final number of attendees for the festival was just over 4,500.\nAll the local businesses who supported the PRIDE had a fantastic day and the Cafe on the corner said it was ‘simply wonderful’ that PRIDE had turned Warrior Square into a venue. I was genuinely overwhelmed and spent much of the day in joyous tears. I expected the litter pick and takedown to take hours but a testament to the respect for the event was that the sad sight of an empty site seemed to take us no time at all.\nPRIDE Official Afterparty\nPeople simply did not want it to end!\nThe Cliff Bar was the venue and I arrived around 10.30 PM to be greeted by a bar so full that as many or more were partying in the zone outside the pub as were inside. In the truest sense of something so good, I intended to leave by midnight but was still with over 250 people when I finally left at 2.30 AM on Sunday.\nI spoke to over 500 people and I am going to keep this as short as I can. I asked why this PRIDE had been so successful as so many told me it had been the best they had ever seen. I am a veteran of 30 PRIDE events (some great, some massive and some not so well thought out) but because of 3 things (significance, total inclusivity and perfect timing for the town)\nThis is the very best PRIDE I have ever attended.\nThe three main responses from the crowd were:\n- This was not commercial, it was community led, not owned by businesses and the only agenda was to include everyone.\n- At this PRIDE, people felt so much more confident and comfortable about being themselves and the numbers who came out testify to the feeling of such beautiful light touch monitoring made it the safest space some attendees have ever seen.\n- A week. I explain this simply by saying a lot of PRIDE’s are for one day only but Southend made it longer, bigger and more diverse than any they had (and I have) ever seen.\nThere are many stories about why Southend has a PRIDE to be proud of after 15 years in exile.\nThose stories are too many to put into words.\n“It was beautiful to see so many in Southend come out and support love and happiness in all forms. Moments like this are what makes our community and shows the better, lighter and more joyful side to people. Truly amazing.”\n– Reece Learmouth – Equality & Diversity Co-Officer, South East Essex Green Party.\n“It was emotional seeing such unity in the community. Being a part of pride alongside so many other amazing people was truly spectacular.”\n– Amy DeCruz – Equality & Diversity Co-Officer, South East Essex Green Party.\nThe Journey\nBy James Vessey-Miller\nAs effortless as it may have looked, Southend Pride took months of tireless work from a band of committed volunteers.\nI am incredibly thrilled to say that I was a part of the team that brought Pride back to Southend, and the fact that I got to lead the Pride March was just the icing on the cake.\nThe organisation of Southend Pride has been one of the most challenging but rewarding experiences of my life. Nine months of dedication and hard work resulted in one of the busiest community events Southend has ever seen.\nTo see thousands of LGBTIQA+ people and Allies march in solidarity through the town centre, after a week’s worth of stellar cultural events was incredibly emotional.\nThe Southend Pride Planning Crew dealt with a lot in the runup to the event. We received barrages of hate and Homophobia on our social media pages, we faced great deals of stress over the financing of the project, and on the day of the march itself, we received the threat of a Protest from the group who gatecrashed London Pride 2018.\nThese challenges only reinforced our commitment to the cause.\nWe faced these challenges united, and what better testament to a community working together that a band of individuals from every walk in life came together to bring back such an important event to Southend. All ages, sexualities, genders, disabilities, and backgrounds, we came together, and so did Southend.\nThe events we have seen in the town last week are only the beginning of a wider movement yet to come.\nWhat was started as a conversation in a Pub one rainy November last year has flourished into the most extraordinary cultural awakening, and there’s no stopping it now.\nSouthend Pride will be back, and it will be back stronger than ever.\nWatch this space.",

This is of course not taking into consideration the money the council has already wasted on the scheme drawing up several architectural drawings, only to then let them expire.\nIf in less than a year, the publicised cost of the project can increase by £15m, how long will it be before we reach the £80m threshold prophesied by SKIPP almost a decade ago?\nIn a time of Austerity, is spending such vast amounts of money on building a museum on geologically unstable ground a good idea when we could be spending that money on the rampant homelessness crisis or community health issues?\nThis farce is now ten years old. The council evidently have no intention of reneging on their former intentions, and we’ve had three substantial power changes in the interim. Labour and Conservative alike, nothing has changed. The genuine concerns of residents have not once been taken into account, and the public support for the Cliffslip museum is at an all-time low.

We know because we live here.\nOur candidates are Care Workers, Students, Accountants, and Teachers; people who understand and are part of our communities.\nWe are already hard at work in our area, striving to improve the quality of our town, and defend it from Conservative cuts.\nWe regularly run year-round community cleanup events, and we are often seen on Southend’s beaches litter picking.\nWe unite communities and work with them to fight the Council’s many damaging projects, and we are the only group locally that truly prioritises our environment.\nWe don’t receive Thousands of pounds in financial support like the other Political Parties do. All of our work is done by dedicated volunteers happy to give up some free time to make Southend the town we know it can be.\nWe believe strongly about fixing some of the problems that have plagued Southend for years, and we offer ACTUAL solutions:\n- We have several solutions to tackle the Homelessness crisis head-on.\n- We will Reinvigorate the empty High Street, and support local businesses.\n- We will end the Tory-backed construction of Luxury High-Profit homes and will work to provide a sustainable housing policy.\n- We will tackle the town’s traffic issues and will fix the congestion on the struggling A127 and A13.\n- We will radically improve Public Transport infrastructure and implement new Safe Cycle routes.\n- We will not allow any NHS downgrades, and we will fight for ALL of our public services.\n- We will improve and create new Leisure Facilities, and we will create new Green Spaces in the town.\n- We will create new local renewable energy systems that will ensure our town is ready for the future.\nWe offer a new, fresh, and exciting vision for Southend and you can see our Manifesto here:\nMany residents are already offering huge amounts of support for our campaigns, and many lifelong Conservative and Labour voters have chosen to support our radical vision for Southend after years of damaging council inaction.\nMost Southend residents agree with us that Southend Council has failed to take our town forward, instead, pursuing multi-million-pound vanity projects like the Cliffslip Museum, Better Queensway, The Forum 2, and the Seaway CarPark development that only serve to win the Council awards.\nWe don’t believe that in a time when Southend has one of the worst Social Housing crises in the country, and the UK’s 8th highest number of Homeless people, we should be spending £40MILLION on a geologically-unstable Museum, and building on three of the town’s most-used Car Parks.\nFor us, Southend Council has prioritised all of the wrong things for too long.\nA change is overdue in Southend, and we believe that we are the people to achieve it.\nWe don’t believe that politics has to be a shouting match.\nThere is no “winner” or “loser” in Elections, but rather a choice of people offering differing priorities.\nInstead of openly attacking other political parties, we show you how we’re different, and what a change we can make with your help.\nWill you help us #MakeSouthendGreen?\nA full list of our 2018 Green Candidates can be found in the Candidates section of our website.\nFor all of our news, updates, and information; Follow us on Facebook and Twitter.\nA full list of every Candidate in all 17 wards in the upcoming Local Elections can be downloaded here:",

The area is not enclosed by building a special wall around it – most of it is enclosed by existing natural boundaries like railway lines or walls. What matters is that the area is completely enclosed by boundaries that conform to Jewish law.\nJewish law says that Jews must not carry any item, no matter how small or for whatever purpose in a Reshus HaRabim (public domain – outside their home) on the Sabbath, even if they are allowed to carry them within their home.\nAn eruv mixes the boundary between the area within the home and the area outside it. The result is that within an eruv Orthodox Jews can follow the same rules on the Sabbath that they would in their homes.\nReform and secular Jews generally disapprove of eruvs – they don’t see any need for them. Orthodox and Conservative Jews approve of them.\nUltra-Orthodox Jews are very strict about the rules for an eruv and often refuse to recognise its validity for legal reasons.\n(from BBC)\nThe Planning Application (17/01263/FUL) details the erection of “street furniture comprising groups of poles (usually two) between which is suspended, at high level, a wire to designate the perimeter of a nominated Eruv at various locations around the borough.“\nThe South East Essex Green Party does not object to the widening in mobility of faith groups, but we are wary of the further connotations of the proposed Eruv.\nOur reservations regarding the planned Southend Eruv are as follows:\n- It potentially breaches human rights by giving a Jewish symbolism to the walls and fences of non-Jews.\n- It potentially breaches the human rights of non-Jewish people forced to pass through symbolic Jewish structures.\n- It is religiously divisive within the Jewish faith and externally, and may, therefore, incite anti-Semitism.\n- There is the potential to set an unwanted precedent of demarcated Religious zones, which contradicts the principles of a multi-faith and multicultural town.\n- Many non-Orthodox Jews argue that it encourages separateness and discourages assimilation – a view we also agree with.\nWhile we recognise the potential positive attributes the Eruv garners our local Jewish community in way of access and mobility, we cannot support it.\nFurther Reading:\nhttp://www.echo-news.co.uk/news/15574871.Jewish_community_wants_structure_that_will_let_them_break_the_Sabbath/\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/judaism/living/eruv_1.shtml",

They’re so bad that, in some cases, a child could fall into the potholes filled with standing water.\n“There are also serious risks for less mobile individuals. For example, navigating these holes and cracks in a wheelchair would be incredibly dangerous.”\nKay Mitchell\nGreen Party Campaigner\nCllr Stuart Allen shared his concerns:\n“I’m deeply worried about the state of our park footpaths and have already raised this issue with council staff. It’s only a matter of time before someone is seriously injured. Across Southend, years of chronic underfunding by the Government have left our public spaces in disrepair. The ongoing effects of austerity are still evident in our local services.”\nA Leigh resident also highlighted an additional concern about vehicles damaging the paths:\n“I’ve noticed more cars driving through the park—heading to the café, cricket club, or basketball courts. Parks should be spaces where children can play freely and people can relax without worrying about traffic. Instead, park users are forced to gather children and leash dogs every time a car passes. It’s time to reclaim these spaces for pedestrians and families, not vehicles.”\nCllr Allen and Kay Mitchell are committed to working alongside residents and council officials to ensure Chalkwell Park becomes a safe and welcoming space for everyone.\n– ENDS –",

Over the years several more cinemas popped up in Southend but one by one they failed to stay profitable and were forced to screen their last films – even the historic building on Alexandra Street that first introduced Southend to the magic of cinema was demolished in 2017. Cinemas in Southend simply couldn’t survive the increasing costs and decreasing attendance… except one.\nThe Odeon at Victoria Plaza opened in 1997 and quickly established itself as one of Southend’s social and cultural landmarks. Until the recent COVID-19 outbreak, the Odeon Southend had served audiences uninterrupted 364 days a year for 22 years.\nIt seems surprising then that for the last eight years there have been talks of a second cinema at Seaway only a few minutes walk from Victoria Plaza. Although cinema attendance has been slowly growing since its record low in the mid-80s, the number of people attending appears to have mostly levelled out over the last 10 years. To introduce another multiplex just walking distance from Southend High Street seems nonsensical. If they were forced to compete it’s certain that neither could thrive simultaneously.\nWhy are developers so intent on adding another building to Southend’s cinema graveyard?\nAs a former employee of the Odeon in Southend, I know how important it is to so many of us.\nI believe the building serves a purpose beyond just a cinema; I honestly see it as the heart of the High Street. Even if you disregard all the time spent watching films there, it’s a landmark when asking for directions, a warm place to duck into while waiting to meet friends and yes… it seems to be the High Street’s most popular loo!\nIn fact, due to its late opening hours, the Odeon has even been used by vulnerable people seeking help at night on rare occasions.\nI include myself in the countless number of people whose first ‘no-grownups’ outing was to the Odeon. For so many parents to trust the Odeon with their children’s independence is a testament to the safe environment the staff are able to maintain. It helps that the Odeon at Southend couldn’t be better positioned for public transport, being a minute’s walk from a train station, several bus stops, and a taxi rank.\nSo what reasons do developers use to justify another cinema?\nSome may argue that an additional cinema in Southend would bring a wider variety of film screenings, but this argument holds little weight when the smallest amount of scrutiny is applied to it.\nAs an 8 screen multiplex with over 1500 seats, Odeon Southend can and does regularly screen indie films, foreign cinema, and documentaries at a time when massive Hollywood blockbusters dominate smaller cinemas. In fact, Odeon screens more than just films; live streams from theatre and opera performances in London always draw in big crowds, and once every four years you can watch England matches from the world cup live with hundreds of other fans on the big screen. In addition, Southend is lucky enough to be host to a lively local Film Festival and several smaller venues that screen even more obscure titles. Any investment by the council should surely be aimed at the local film societies and small businesses that are already contributing to our town’s community of culture.\nAnother claim is that the Odeon in Southend is not up to standard, and a brand new luxury cinema would draw in audiences.\nAgain, I find this hard to understand. Personally I think our Odeon’s inviting entrance, a wide-open lobby that lets you see up to several floors, is more architecturally interesting than most cinema foyers. Personal opinion aside, Odeon have invested considerable money and time into keeping the front of house space modern and relevant, recently leading to a complete redesign of the front of house area and swapping out the box office for digital ticket booths. Behind the scenes, I know that the projectors and screens are under constant review and are regularly updated with the latest technology, meaning that even a brand new cinema could not exceed the image and sound quality that Odeon already provides. In fact, most people’s biggest criticism of our current cinema is the cost of tickets. However, with the EMPIRE Seaway cinema claiming to be ‘state of the art’, it’s hard to imagine they will provide a more affordable option than the cinemas we already have.\nIn fact, the only compelling argument in favour of the unpopular Seaway proposals is that the council has already committed £3million of tax-payers money into planning it, and would have to refund the government if it were to cancel the project. Although it would be a shame to waste this money, it’s just a fraction of the proposed cost, especially when you take into account what we stand to lose; our existing cinema, hundreds of car parking spaces on the seafront, and if local business owners are to be believed – dozens more shops and cafes from an already suffering High Street.\nI can, however, see why the council is tempted by this project.\nThey are worried that Southend High Street can’t compete with big shopping centres and cinemas elsewhere in Essex or even London. Developers have taken advantage of this fear before.\nIn 2008 the Victoria Plaza was given a complete refurbishment and renamed the Victoria Shopping Centre in a bid to save our High Street. This project cost £25million and, 12 years later, half the shops inside are still empty. It has all the things that the Seaway project is proposing – a variety of shops and restaurants right in the heart of Southend with a cinema next door.\nI wonder if in another 12 years’ time the Seaway complex will be half empty and the council will be proposing another massive investment to ‘save the High Street’.\nThe Victoria Shopping Centre not only serves as a warning against the Seaway project, but I think it may also be the solution to the problem that Seaway claims it will resolve; We have the empty shops and there’s already a great cinema right there – all the council needs to do is find a way to populate the Victoria Centre with businesses.\nDo that, and our beach can keep its car park and Southend can keep its cinema.\nFurther Reading:\nhttps://www.essexlive.news/news/essex-news/50m-plans-southend-seas-seaway-3918523\nhttps://www.greenandpartners.co.uk/investment/victoria-shopping-centre-southend-7630/",

All other homes on the site are Council-owned.\nThe Council have released no plans for how this scheme will operate, or who will be operating it.\n- The council have claimed that the ‘Right To Buy’ will be retained, but at what cost?\nHow ‘affordable’ will these homes be?\n- There is a proposed 1-per-household (1:1) parking provision.\nWith 859 of the planned properties being non-affordable, how likely is it that every household will only have one car?\nHow will many extra cars unable to park on the site impact neighbouring areas?\n- There is a ‘Commercial & Retail element’ in current plans, with no assurance these units will be filled.\nWhat will happen to these empty units?\nWill they -like the units on Sutton Road- eventually be turned into yet more low-cost high-profit homes?\n- The proposed extreme road changes will extend travel times, increase congestion for traffic to Sutton Road and Southchurch Road from Victoria Circus, and significantly increase local Air Pollution.\nFor an Ambulance responding to a Heart Attack call in under seven minutes, how long will it be delayed by battling through traffic on the Victoria Circus or Chichester Road?\n- The plans do not detail new Schools or Healthcare Facilities, yet additional homes on the site will increase pressure on local services.\nSouthend already has the second highest number of GP vacancies in the country and our GP Surgeries are struggling.\n1000 extra families will take its toll on the local amenities.\n- Southend is already developed far above the National Average, and it is not sustainable.\nThe town is currently at 65% developed on -and increasing- whereas the national average is 6%.\nSource: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-41901294\n- What is going to happen to the Southend Storehouse Foodbank and Support Services, currently on the Queensway site?\nThese essential services are vital for those who rely on them. Where will they go?\nUPDATE:\nOn 23/10/2018, the Echo Reported that the Southend Storehouse run by Southend Vineyard is being forced out of its current premises on Coleman Street due to the “Better Queensway” developments.\nThe Church-run charity is now being forced to fundraise the £630,000 to purchase a new venue in the town centre.\nOur question is; when the service helps feed almost 2% of the town’s population, why aren’t Southend Council helping finance the move?\n- With the proposed loss of the Short Street and Essex Street public car parks, and central town parking already very stretched, where are people going to park in Central Southend?\nA loss of central car parking in the town will negatively impact the businesses of the high street and will result in many people parking on neighbouring residential roads.\nWe think the people of Southend deserve to have these concerns adequately answered by the Council.\nNo Plan For Queensway Residents.\nAt a recent meeting* attended by Mrs Fletcher, Councillor Ian Gilbert, and Councillor David Norman MBE, it was revealed to the South East Essex Green Party that the Council currently have no plans for the future of the current Queensway Residents.\nCouncillor Norman said that the current situation of social housing in Southend was “the worst social housing crisis in the country” and that on average only one or two properties become available each month for those on the waiting list.\nCurrently, that waiting list is over 2500 people long, meaning that even if the Queensway residents get priority on that list, it would still take 16 YEARS to rehome just the Queensway Residents at the current rate, and a further 104 YEARS to house the entire housing list.\nIt was also revealed that the Council would not be using the Emergency Housing Provision (facilitated by South Essex Homes) to house the Queensway Residents, as the service’s 120 units are already over-capacity.\nCouncillor Gilbert suggested that the issue of rehoming the current residents would be circumvented by building the new-build properties to the east of the site (Essex Road) first, and housing residents in these buildings while the rest of the demolition and construction work was undertaken. – This has not been substantiated by the council, has not been published by the council or the Better Queensway scheme, and it has not been described in any official documentation.\n(*at the 28.11.2017 Women’s Refuge meeting hosted by South Essex Homes at Civic Centre.)\n“We believe that there should be a published action plan for the immediate and secure rehoming of the Queensway residents BEFORE any work starts.”\nTHE OPINION OF RESIDENTS.\nWe spoke with Mike Smith, Secretary of the Queensway Residents Association to get a better understanding of the residents’ feelings towards the project.\nHe explained that while every resident has been sent the glossy Better Queensway brochure and has been invited to numerous consultation meetings with the Council, many residents have not engaged with the scheme, and meeting turnout is often low.\nHe noted that the buildings had some structural surveying undertaken recently, and the findings of those tests were rumoured that the buildings were “completely structurally fine for the next thirty years,” in direct opposition to the council’s narrative.\nThese test results have not been published by the Council.\nWe have submitted a Freedom of Information request to ascertain the structural condition of the four towers.\nMr Smith added, that in a perfect scenario; “I’d rather it not happen, and a full refurbishment takes place.”\nHe did stress to us, however, that not every resident shares his views, and that most are in favour of complete demolition of the site.\n“The majority of residents are worried about how vague the Council has been, and the lack of clarity is upsetting some people.“\nMr Smith explained to us of the Council’s current intention to develop the site in stages over a construction phase lasting “five to seven years” initially with the Essex Street quadrant first.\nThe 54 Leaseholders across the site will apparently be offered a non-negotiable sum of the market value of the property, plus ten percent, while those in Social Housing have been offered a priority place on the Council Housing List, potentially superseding those in most immediate need. A concerning state of affairs considering many at the top of the list have been waiting for several years for Social Housing.\nWe asked him about his views on some of our concerns over parking, traffic, and Air Quality, and he agreed with us that serious thought needs to be exercised on the Council’s part and that current proposals show a clear and evident lack of foresight.\nThere are too many very serious unanswered questions and such a lack of detail in these propositions that we cannot be satisfied that this scheme is purely in the interests of locals.\nIt is our belief that this project in current form will:\n- Risk the Queensway Residents becoming homeless.\n- Increase congestion on the Victoria Circus Interchange and Chichester Road/Short Street areas.\n- Increase pressure on local Schools and Health services.\n- Increase local Air Pollution and worsen environmental standards for the area.\n- Negatively impact parking in local neighbourhoods by removing the central town Carparks.\n- Reduce the number of Council-owned Social Housing properties in Southend, at a time where more is required.\nFurther Reading:\nhttps://www.echo-news.co.uk/news/17413248.hundreds-of-affordable-homes-promised-in-500m-southend-town-centre-scheme/\nEcho Article: Tenants in crumbling tower blocks may be added to council house waiting list when they are demolished – 11th April\nEcho Article: Anger over Queensway underpass plans in £300m estate revamp in Southend – 17th April.",

Greens objected to plans for a new London-style Mayor for 1.5 million residents and the merging of Districts to create “super-councils” serving 500,000 residents each – changes that would likely see Southend merged with Castle Point and Rochford District Councils by 2027. Concerningly, this new mayor system would remove local safeguards on planning, transport, and economic growth, with these decisions being made outside of our community.\n“Whilst we’re told of the benefits and efficiency of such a reorganisation and a directly elected mayoral combined authority, these are largely unproven, hypothetical and represent a risk to local democracy as there is little evidence of how this will benefit our residents in terms of planning, housing economic stimulus, transport, healthcare and environmental issues.\n“Southend is as financially robust as it can be and as a small unitary authority already has some autonomy over its affairs. Taking on more regional responsibility risks this and changes the demographics of local democracy, effectively disenfranchising our local electorate. Whilst I appreciate the 10th January deadline puts our leadership under pressure, this proposal is largely ill-thought-out and does a disservice to the electorate and possibly a cross-party collaboration on how best to move forward in a unified way.\n“Local government is all about serving the residents and allowing them to shape how their urban areas develop and evolve. Whilst I recognise this will happen in any event – and fast-tracking may well put Southend forward on a firm footing – Without further detail, or even a draft letter of intent, our group cannot commit to something so vague that risks destabilising Southend Council and the wider region.”\nCllr Richard Longstaff\nLeader of the Green Group on Southend City Council\nCllr Stuart Allen, representing Leigh ward, echoed these concerns:\n“Devolution should be about empowering local communities, but I’m not convinced this proposal is in the best interests of Southend residents. The approach feels more like a top-down directive than genuine devolution. Offering £20 million might sound appealing, but it raises questions about whether this is the right move for us or simply a way to push through a one-size-fits-all solution.\n“We need to ensure that any changes truly benefit our communities. That means proper consultation, real debate, and a model that reflects the needs of Southend—not arbitrary figures like 500,000-resident unitaries or an additional tier of governance led by a strategic mayor.”\nNationally, the Green Party’s Co-Leader and MP for Waveney Valley, Adrian Ramsay, criticised the broader implications of the Government’s approach:\n“The creation of super-councils removes the local from local government. This is not the right way forward. I am not opposed to reform of local government but if the point of devolution is to transfer power to local communities, this will achieve the opposite by undermining the sense of ownership and local accountability which communities currently have. These are major changes – the biggest for half a century. They should not be rushed without proper consideration of all the options.”\nThe Green Party advocates for a devolution model built from the grassroots, allowing councils to determine structures that work best for them. Alongside this, they are calling for a fairer funding model to enable local councils to deliver essential services effectively.\n– ENDS –",

That may mean some libraries are not viable. But if that is the case, we want to talk to communities about how they can become involved and run a library service with our support. The consultation is the opportunity to feedback on our plans and make sure that views are heard and considered.”\nIn a recent community meeting about the future of Great Wakering library attended by the Green Party, concerned residents spoke about how the public transport links were not viable enough to ensure that residents could still access vital traditional Library services easily.\nMany spoke of their concern over the loss of such a community asset, and how the additional services the library offers, such as free WiFi and as a venue for many social and community groups could not be replaced by a 24/7 online resource.\nThe three Green Party Councillors in Hulbridge, where one of the many libraries set to close under the proposals is, have organised a petition and released a short statement:\n“The Hullbridge Library is an important community Hub and should remain open and fully funded by local government.”\nThe petition is available online, and physically in various locations across the village.\nFor more information, please email CllrMichael.Hoy@Rochford.gov.uk\nThe separate petition to save Great Wakering Library is available here:\nThere are several petitions running concurrently to save the affected Libraries, many organised by Green Party campaigners across the County.\nThe South East Essex Green Party and our elected Councillors will be working with other community organisations to help publicise the planned consultation and help stop the closure of the affected libraries.\nA 12-week long consultation on the future of Essex libraries will take place between 29th November 2018 and 20th February 2019.\nYou can view and submit a response to the consultation here:\nhttps://libraries.essex.gov.uk/libraries-consultation\nThe findings from the consultation will be published and any changes proposed considered in June 2019.\n“The South East Essex Green Party recognises that Libraries form a vital community resource that extends beyond traditional book loan. The planned closure of 25 libraries across Essex purely for financial reasons will impact residents in rural communities disproportionally and is therefore unjustifiable.\nPoor Public Transport routes mean that for many, the proposed alternative physical Library service recommended by the proposals are beyond the reasonable reach of many, including elderly and disabled people.\nMost Libraries provide a much-needed facility for social groups, and the free WiFi service to customers is not something that can be replaced by a cheaper-to-run online resource.\nThe South East Essex Green Party is opposed to the planned closure of the 25 Libraries across Essex, and we are firmly against the additional threat of 19 further Library closures.\nWe condemn and refute the suggestion that the sites of planned closure show ‘low evidence of need’ and assert that these last bastions of physical Public amenity need to be safeguarded against plans driven simply by cost-cutting measures.”\nFurther Reading:\nEssex Future Library Sevices Strategy 2019-2024 (PDF)\nhttps://www.thebookseller.com/news/25-essex-libraries-earmarked-closure-893966\nhttps://www.essexlive.news/news/essex-news/essex-libraries-libraries-earmarked-close-2219627",

The motion proposed crucial updates to the city’s tree policy, including the introduction of a comprehensive methodology toolbox, the formation of a scrutiny working party, and a commitment to plant thousands of new trees across the city. However, despite unanimous support in the chamber, the motion has since been rejected by the previous Conservative administration, leaving all aspects of it unimplemented.\n“The cabinet’s decision to let this vital motion fall into the abyss is a huge disservice to our city.\nIronically, everyone initially approved it, yet no action has been taken to protect and preserve our trees.”\nCllr Richard Longstaff, Leigh Ward\nSouthend’s tree population, which is currently estimated at 29,000, is under increasing threat. Around 300 trees are felled each year, some of which could be saved with better management practices. The city’s diminishing tree canopy cover is of particular concern, as it takes decades for newly planted trees to reach maturity. To restore the tree canopy to a healthier level of 17%, Southend would need to plant approximately 12,000 trees—a task that would take over a century if only 100 trees are planted annually.\n“We are losing so many mature trees for various reasons and they can’t be simply replaced by saplings. At this rate of removal, it will take 120 years to reach our target of 17%.”\n“We need to plant thousands of trees now for future generations to benefit, especially as climate change continues to accelerate extreme weather and heatwaves, that are a critical risk to health and wellbeing of Southend’s residents.”\nThe motion also highlighted the need for a proactive response to tree diseases, calling for the council to collaborate with Defra’s Forest Research to ensure that any suspected cases are thoroughly investigated through lab testing. The council further called for clarity regarding tree removal decisions, citing concerns about trees being felled for vague reasons such as “incompatibility with highways.”\nCouncillor Longstaff is now urging Southend to take bold steps to protect its tree canopy cover and green spaces. The motion proposes entering into a collaborative Knowledge Transfer Partnership with specialist institutions such as Anglia Ruskin University’s Global Sustainability Institute and Writtle College. This partnership would help develop a best-practice methodology toolbox for managing the city’s trees, ensuring that tree removal is only used as a last resort.\nThe Green Party’s motion is also calling for the creation of an interactive, publicly accessible map to identify potential tree-planting locations and for all mature trees on the removal list to be subject to democratic debate at a relevant committee or working party.\n“This is a moment for Southend to become a trailblazer in urban tree preservation, by taking a new approach and collaborating with key partners, we can secure a greener future for our city.”\n– ENDS –",

  "https_southeastessex_greenparty_org_uk_/https_southeastessex_greenparty_org_uk_news_2025_03_03_political-viewpoint-march-2025/content_14.html": "Almost a year has passed since I joined Richard Longstaff in representing Leigh residents and the Green Party on Southend Council. Over the past year, we Greens have worked hard to solve local issues, challenge policies that threaten our community, and advocate for a more sustainable approach. However, with the Labour Government imposing devolution on our area, the next year will bring uncertainties.\nIn January, the Greens led in scrutinising Labour’s devolution plans, which will remove local decision-making in favour of centralised Mayoralties pursuing Westminster projects. The proposal to create 500,000-resident “super councils”, and a new Greater Essex Mayor raises serious concerns. This restructuring risks stripping Southend of its autonomy, diminishing local accountability, and placing additional financial burdens on taxpayers. While possibilities of improving public transport are welcome, the planned changes to local say in planning threatens to undermine councillors’ ability to represent our communities effectively.\nWhen questioned, Southend’s Labour-led Cabinet cited the Government’s so-called mandate; a mandate based on just 20% of the registered electorate – hardly a strong democratic consensus. Most residents would be unaware that council reorganisation of this scale was even in Labour’s manifesto. That’s why I encourage all residents to participate in the public consultation which runs until 13th April. This is our only opportunity for our community to voice concerns about the plans that will reshape our area for generations.\nThe threat of large-scale developments built inappropriately on green belt land is more real than ever. This could see thousands of high-profit and poor-quality homes built on natural spaces, eroding our dwindling green belt and straining local services. Everyone can agree that building quality, affordable, and sustainable housing is crucial, but this approach ignores community and environmental needs and will only worsen existing problems.\nThe Government’s pursuit of GDP growth remains concerning. Infinite growth on a finite planet is scientifically impossible and irresponsible. For decades, GDP has been used as the measure of our national success, but has this focus on growth made us happier or healthier? The reality is that it hasn’t. It’s time for alternative measures of progress that prioritise sustainability, and which put people’s well-being and quality of life over profit-driven expansion.\nPeople want change because the current system is failing to meet the needs of ordinary people. People have less money in their pockets, and every household is feeling the strain of ever-increasing bills. It is shameful that so many people – especially young people in full-time employment simply cannot afford somewhere to live. These challenges should be the top priority of this new government, but we’re just seeing a continuation of the same tired mindset; leave it to the markets and corporations to fix. This thinking has never worked, and it’s time for something different- something that prioritises the urgent needs of our country.\nLocally, the Council has recently set its annual budget. The Greens have been asking tough questions to ensure public funds are used effectively. A major concern of ours is the growing proportion of taxpayers’ money being channelled into lucrative private sector contracts. This is evident in children’s social care, which was overspent by around £8 million this year. The privatisation of essential services is unsustainable, yet councils remain trapped in a failed mindset. The reality is declining service standards, escalating costs, and financial instability. When I challenged this, raising these concerns at Council, the reaction – audible gasps from some councillors – just reinforced my belief that the Green Party is the only group standing up for common-sense policies in the interests of residents. Our priority is clear: ensuring that our public services serve residents, not overseas shareholders.\nSince Richard’s last viewpoint, we have welcomed two outstanding individuals to the Green team: Kay Mitchell and Tricia Cowdrey, both former Councillors and both bring a wealth of experience and will contribute towards our mission for residents. I look forward to working with both of these fantastic community champions and the many new members we’ve welcomed in recent months in holding our Council and MPs to account.\nThe Green Party remains committed to standing up for residents, challenging flawed policies, and offering an alternative vision – one that prioritises well-being and the health of our people and planet. Our fight for a Fairer, Greener Southend continues, and I encourage everyone to join us, get involved, and work with us to make change happen.",

This area of the seafront by the attractions is very popular with families and dog walkers, and frequently sees young children and pets playing on the sea wall and beach. Just minutes after this worker was seen spraying close to the children’s play equipment further along, one of our members had to warn families with young children to avoid the area for safety concerns.\nThe local Green Party has been challenging the council over its continued and widespread use of these dangerous chemicals for years. Many residents are rightly concerned for the devastating ecological impact these substances have on our wildlife and pets, and further the documented cancer-causing health risk it poses to humans. Here we see the video evidence that the council isn’t listening.\nOur coordinator James Vessey-Miller grilled the council in a recent meeting about their continued use of these substances, and shockingly Leigh’s Cllr Mulroney responded by wrongly claiming that these carcinogenic herbicides were “completely safe”. Southend Council has claimed for years that it is pursuing a “phased reduction” of these dangerous chemicals. It insists that it only uses these chemicals when necessary, and does all it can to avoid their use when alternatives are possible.\nThe Green Party refutes this claim, as we’ve seen them spraying this stuff across whole areas year-round, with no evidence of alternative weed control even being trialled at scale. We’re yet to even see any meaningful reduction on 2018 levels. We have a whole folder of evidence of the council using ride-on tractors like this to coat entire swathes of our city in these dangerous chemicals, and in our opinion, it’s often completely unnecessary. Far too often our members have witnessed council employees spraying these herbicides as a corner-cutting way of avoiding more labour-intensive manual weed control around streetlights, benches, and children’s play equipment. Shockingly, we’ve even seen the council spraying in this manner against the fences of primary schools.\nWe’re publishing this video today to evidence that despite what they say in their press releases, the council’s widespread usage of these harmful chemicals is ongoing, and that they simply don’t care that they’re doing it in areas that subject our children and pets to unjustifiable risk.\nThe Green Party continues to hold the council to account, and today we’re again calling on them to impose an immediate ban on the use of these dangerous Herbicides.\nWe call on Southend Council to do the right thing and stop the use of these chemicals.\nDo you have any evidence or stories of the council using these herbicides?\nShare with us in the comments below:",

  "https_southeastessex_greenparty_org_uk_/https_southeastessex_greenparty_org_uk_news_2022_03_24_greens-challenge-council-on-cycling-infrastructure/content_184.html": "This evening, our branch coordinator James Vessey-Miller attended the meeting of Southend City Council.\nAsking the council two written questions, James challenged the council over its dire track record on supporting cycling in Southend-on-Sea.\nHe said;\nThe results of a survey conducted by the Green Party in Southend in 2021 found that only 10% of respondents thought that the council sufficiently priorities cycling.\n86% of respondents felt that bike theft is an issue of concern in Southend, and that the Police and Council are not doing enough to tackle bike theft across the town. 63% of people we asked said that they would not feel comfortable locking up their bicycle in town or at train stations, and said they would be concerned that their bike would not be safe if left unattended. A further 19% of people said they had previously been a victim of bike theft in Southend.\nA staggering 95.7% of respondents said the cycling infrastructure across Southend was inadequate, with 84.95% saying they would not feel comfortable with cycling with their children or younger members of their family across Southend. Only 7.5% of responders said they regularly cycle to school with their children. This demonstrates that the council are not doing enough at present to safeguard and prioritise cycling.\nThe benefits of cycling are vast; mental and physical wellbeing benefits are well-documented, and the average cyclist isn’t just better on Carbon emissions, but far better on our streets in terms of public space, congestion, air pollution, and road traffic accidents. If Southend is to meet its imperative climate goals, encouraging cycling amongst residents should be very high on that agenda.\nIn the Full Council meeting of 10th March, the Portfolio Holder announced that of the £741,600 Active Travel Fund, just £241,000 is to be spent on cycling infrastructure across the city, with a large proportion of that to be spent on yet another expensive and needless public consultation on an A13 ‘painted bike lane’ scheme.\nContrast that to the council’s commitment to spending £10million per annum for another 18 years on Highways investments, and the town’s cyclists are again wondering which road users the council is prioritising in its investments. Given the unprecedented urgency of the climate emergency, Cycling receiving a figure 41 times lower than that of car users would be scandalous. It continues to signal a now outdated assumption that car use should be the default transit method for every resident in Southend. This is not at all compatible with your stated climate and Active Travel goals.\nCan the Portfolio Holder outline how much of the £10million Highways Budget is ring-fenced for improvements to the city’s cycling infrastructure, and what new safe and segregated cycle routes and infrastructure are currently being implemented by the authority?\nThe Cabinet Member for Transport, Asset Management, and Inward Investment, Cllr Wakefield responded by saying:\n“The authority receives money from a number of sources; For active travel interventions, it has received two main funds from central government.\nThe Secretary of State for Transport awarded £309k for Tranche 1 of the Active Travel Fund. This fund supported producing cycling and walking facilities. In particular, Southend Council created four pilot Schools Streets and one pilot CCTV School Keep Clear enforcement scheme.\nTranche 2 of the same fund awarded £741.6k and will support the creation of:\n- Holistic Network Wide Cycle Audit & Master Planning of A13 Active Travel Corridor;\n- Prittlewell Brook Greenway Lighting and Connectivity Improvements;\n- A further rollout of the School Streets initiative;\n- Cycling Improvements to the public realm – secure cycle parking, electric bike charging, and repair stations.\nIn addition to this, the Local Transport Plan Grant supports sustainable transport projects and has been used to co-fund the London Road works that included the installation of secure cycle parking.\nYou’ll notice the council gave no firm answer on anything.",

Earlier this year, the land was sold by the NHS to the Government Agency Homes England for £7.8 million.\nThe area including neighbouring land to the east and west, (which in 1994 was classified as Green Belt and as “land of high agricultural quality”) was reclassified as ‘safeguarded land’ following a legal challenge by a private developer.\nThe National Planning Policy Framework 2012 advises that local plans should make clear that the safeguarded land is not allocated for development and that planning permission for the permanent development of safeguarded land should only be granted following a Local Plan review which proposes the development.\nTo date, the proposed Southend United FC Stadium or this housing estate is yet to be included in the Southend Local Plan.\nRather notoriously, Rochford District Council remains openly opposed to the Stadium proposals, citing;\n- The height, mass and bulk of the proposal would have an adverse impact upon the openness of the countryside and the Green Belt.\n- The increase in activity as a result of this use would be likely to have an adverse impact upon the local highway network.\n- The application is not supported by a Green Travel Plan and given the site’s location, remote from a range of other forms of transport, then there will be a heavy reliance upon the use of private motor vehicles, which would be contrary to the principles relating to sustainable development.\nThe site Fossetts For The People are campaigning for, also has to contend with a Scheduled Monument immediately abutting the southern boundary of the site known as “Prittlewell Camp.”\nThe planning application for an NHS Diagnostic and Treatment Centre in 2003 was accompanied by a Desk Based Archaeological Assessment and Archaeological Evaluation Report based on 43 archaeological trenches across the subject site.\nStudies found Post-Medieval deposits, early deposits including some worked flints, flint flakes, bone and pottery fragments and a possible hollow way which may have led to the entrance to the camp. Evidence of a large municipal dump was also found on the western part of the site.\nAny housing planned for the site would also likely be quite-rightly subject to similar archaeological scrutiny.\nOUR OPINION:\n1. The new SUFC Stadium and its Retail Park will kill off our already-struggling High Street.\nMost planning applications are granted or rejected on a precedential basis; especially big ones.\nIf one house is granted a one-storey extension, you can almost guarantee that any neighbouring house will also be granted planning permission based on the precedent that has been set.\nBuilding a 400-home residential estate on adjoining agricultural land will only lend precedent to the SUFC Stadium plans, making it much more of a reality. While this might not immediately sound like an inherently terrible thing, it most certainly is.\nAn independent report by consultancy firm Boyers, commissioned by Southend Council, claims that the Stadium and attached Retail Park is being built at a time when the town centre is “fragile” and “vulnerable” and is already causing retailers to avoid investing in the town centre.\nA spokesperson for Southend BID, an organisation which campaigns for business improvements in the borough, said it “strongly objects to the retail and leisure element of the proposals that would have a significant adverse impact on the town centre.”\nOut-of-Town Retail and Leisure complexes kill High Streets.\nOurs is struggling; let’s prevent anything that speeds up the last nail in the coffin.\nThe South East Essex Green Party objects to the proposed Southend United Football Club Stadium and Retail complex at Fossetts Farm, and as such, any project that lends planning precedent to the proposals is something that we cannot support.\n2. Southend Council has the capacity to bring back into use over 200 empty houses, but it CHOOSES not to.\nIn early 2018, following a Freedom of Information Request by the South East Essex Green Party, we exclusively revealed that Southend Borough Council collected a Council Tax premium on 235 empty properties amounting to over £475,000 in 2016/17.\nThis means that Southend Borough Council is aware of at least 235 empty properties across Southend that could be brought back into use using the council’s EDMO powers.\nEmpty Dwelling Management Orders (EDMOs) are a legal device used in England & Wales which enable local authorities to put an unoccupied property back into use as housing.\nA further FOI request revealed in the last five years, Southend Borough Council has not executed a single Empty Dwelling Management Order, with the council’s own role of Empty Homes Officer sitting unfilled for more than a year.\nSimply, Southend Borough Council has the capacity to bring back into use over two-hundred homes but it CHOOSES not to.\nWe feel we should be campaigning to bring empty homes back into use, before campaigning to build 400 units on Agricultural land.\n3. It’s time to prioritise building on Brownfield sites.\nWe’re not against building homes, far from it.\nThe Green Party believes that Brownfield sites hold the key to sustainable housing development, especially in towns like Southend.\nIn August, Jonathan Bartley, co-leader of the Green Party, said;\n“Everyone deserves to have somewhere safe and secure to call home. Instead of overseeing the erosion of our green space, the Government should invest in increasing social and affordable housing on the plentiful brownfield sites in our towns and cities, take action on empty homes, and introduce a Land Value Tax to encourage the use of vacant land and reduce speculation.”\nThe Campaign to Protect Rural England also commented that; “Government figures show that the amount of brownfield land becoming available for re-development is far outstripping the rate at which it is being used and there is enough available for 1.5 million new homes.”\nSouthend is teeming with previously-used and derelict Brownfield land that is perfect for a new and sustainable housebuilding strategy.\nThe town is currently at 65% developed on -and increasing- whereas the national average is just 6%.\nFor comparison, Basildon is 36% developed on, and Colchester (a City similar in size) is just 11% developed on.\nContracting a commercial private developer to build 400 units on agricultural land next to a scheduled monument is neither sustainable or rational given the plentiful alternative opportunities that exist across the town.\nCovering fields in concrete for the sake of growth is not progress.\n4. Social Housing on Paper rarely means Social Housing in Practice.\nWe’ve seen this all before.\n- Plans are drawn up to build a new ‘landmark’ social housing project that will ‘solve the town’s housing crisis.’\n- A private contractor is brought in to finance or part-finance the development.\n- Suddenly not nearly as many houses are really as ‘affordable’ as previously intended, and the developer is building the bare-minimum of truly-affordable homes.\nLook at the Queensway Development in Southend. What started as a well-intentioned regeneration scheme is now bringing 900 additional luxury town-centre commuter homes to an area that already struggles with overpopulation. GPs and Schools are struggling for places, and the Air Quality in the Town Centre is worsening considerably.\nWhen the Fossetts For The People campaign says “the alternative will be that a private developer moves in, creating hefty profits for itself and its shareholders by building ‘executive’ homes for London commuters” they’re probably talking about the very firms that would, in reality, end up building the very development they’re so passionately campaigning for. That’s exactly what is happening at Queensway.\nWhile the South East Essex Green Party empathises with the motivations of the campaign, we cannot support the ‘Fossetts for The People’ proposals.\nSTATEMENT ENDS.\nFurther Reading:\nFossets Farm Development Brief [PDF]\nhttps://southend.jdi-consult.net/localplan/viewrepfull.php?repid=2616",

Towns like ours were constructed years before cars were even considered integral in town planning, and as a result, every summer our town centre is swamped with handling the many thousands of tourists that visit by car, causing innumerable issues for locals.\nCurrently, a significant majority of these visitors travel here in their own cars, adding to the town’s already chronic issues of congestion, toxic air pollution, and residential streets jam-packed bumper-to-bumper with cars.\nNaturally, these recurring issues cause a great amount of frustration for the town’s residents, and in return, the council continually makes rushed decisions on town planning as short-term ‘fixes’ for these issues.\nPrevious twentieth-century suggestions to these issues involved progressively extreme road widening schemes, the loss of our green spaces to ever-larger car parks, retail parks, and roads, and the permanent dedication of vast swathes of our town to simply storing parked cars.\nDespite these extreme measures, Southend still has inadequate town centre parking at peak times, a year-round shortage of on-street parking, and still suffers from the same issues the council aimed to fix in the first place.\nWith the recent news that the council is again considering “sunset ideas” of road widening and new car parks to tackle the issues, we remind residents that these proposals will not work, because these kinds of schemes never have.\nNew research from the South East Essex Green Party published today visualises how much of our town centre is lost to just parking cars.\nVast amounts of land in the town centre that could be made into affordable housing or green spaces for residents to enjoy is instead devoted to storing cars, and 20-30% of the urban road space throughout the town is lost to roadside car parking. A huge amount of the public realm is dedicated to cars, and it has resulted in streets designed not for residents, but for motorists. This has had fatal consequences.\nNone of the council’s previous traffic-alleviation measures has worked.\nThat’s because the council continues to fail to account for Induced Demand in town planning, and is failing to listen to climate science telling us we must urgently transition to low-impact travel options.\nInduced demand shows that car traffic increases proportionally with increased road capacity. In other words, the easier you make it for people to travel by car, the more people will choose car travel as their main travel option, adding to the problems. Roads are made ever-wider to accommodate more cars, and in turn, the wider roads lead to more cars being bought and used.\nThis concept is also key to understanding the issue in the provision of parking in Southend. The more space that is found and devoted to parking for cars, the more people will travel here by car in the knowledge there’s a parking space for them when they arrive. If the council signals to tourists that our town is only car-accessible, the more we will struggle with congestion and air pollution when those tourists arrive by car. Governmental policy and our own town planning for the last 60 years have worked on the assumption that people will only travel if they can do so by car. This is fundamentally untrue.\nTo illustrate this, a tiny proportion of visitors to London travel by car because of the traffic, the lack of parking spaces, and the high parking charges. That doesn’t stop people from visiting London however, with most people still commuting and visiting just as often, but instead opting to go via train, a considerably lower impact travel alternative.\nIf we’re to tackle the many serious issues in Southend caused by excessive motorists, then we must stop designing the town treating car travel as the default.\nWithout a change in direction now, this problem will continue to worsen.\nTHE GREEN SOLUTION\nTo quote Field of Dreams; “You build it, and they will come.”\nIn the last century, we’ve reshaped our whole town around car use so it’s understandable why the unimaginative amongst us can’t see any other option. But if we’ve reshaped our town before, it can be done again.\nAs we recover from the COVID pandemic, we have a perfect opportunity to reimagine our streets, and radically reshape how we want people to visit and travel across the borough. In light of the climate emergency, a greater emphasis needs to be made on enabling greener travel options for every resident through sustainable town infrastructure design.\nThe first task at hand is to simply acknowledge that no town can facilitate an endlessly growing number of motorists. Currently, town planning assumes car travel is the default for every resident, and this has led to chronic underfunding of other travel alternatives. No wonder why a majority of residents travel across town by car currently, when the other alternatives are an expensive and unreliable bus network and a disjointed and unsafe cycle network.\nWe need an urgent reevaluation of who our streets are designed for.\nInnovative schemes such as Low Traffic Neighbourhoods and ‘Mini Holland’ style traffic restrictions would reduce the rat-running commonplace throughout the town, and a borough-wide Low Emission Zone would target the dirtiest vehicles on our streets to tackle toxic air pollution.\nThe adoption of a 15-Minute City approach to town planning would also reshape how far residents need to travel to meet their daily needs. If a majority of a person’s needs can be met within a 20-minute walk or cycle, how many people would need to use a car daily at all? Ipswich has already committed to pushing ahead with such a 15-Minute City scheme and has announced a major investment into making services and quality of life accessible within the space of a short walk from the home of every resident, cutting down unnecessary journeys that would have been done by car. This can be achieved in Southend.\nWe should be aiming for greater diversification of transit options for Southend’s residents, and that begins with putting the required infrastructure in place first.\nThe creation of new safe cycle routes needs to be an immediate priority, and must functionally connect the town in a modern road design that prioritises bus and cycle users over car travel. New active transit corridors should be implemented for east/west travel, and fully-lit and CCTV-monitored safe cycle storage facilities should be installed at every appropriate location.\nThere’s already more than enough room on our streets for new segregated safe cycle lanes; and on most roads in Southend, this can be achieved without entirely removing existing on-street car parking. Many neighbourhoods of Paris and Copenhagen have parking layouts where parked cars are used as a barrier between cyclists and moving traffic, which in turn forces vehicles to travel more slowly, bettering road safety for pedestrians. Such “woonerfs” schemes already exist in Amsterdam and could be adopted in Southend.\nTo facilitate the new online order economy, we can also introduce cargo-bike delivery hubs across the borough, allowing for greener transportation of goods and services. These cargo bikes, in turn, would use the new cycle lanes, alleviating our roads of more delivery van traffic.\nWe need a new and ambitious Integrated Transport Plan, increasing the provision, reliability and affordability of Public Transport services. We need a significant improvement in the frequency, accessibility, number of routes, and overall reliability of bus infrastructure across the borough. We also need to introduce new night bus services across the town and improve the frequency and reliability of weekend bus services too.\nThe greenest travel option should always be the cheapest and most convenient option if we’re to encourage people out of their cars.\nBold action should be taken to make town centre shopping districts pedestrianised and car-free. Following an Oslo model, begin to replace on-street vehicle parking spaces with space for climate-resilient urban greening, parklets, and cycle parking.\nAnd as for the many seasonal visitors; as a town with a significant tourist economy, we need to make taking the bus or train more convenient, cheaper, and more accessible than travelling here by car. Following the success of a new sustainable transport system for the town, redundant surface car parks can be developed into spaces that benefit locals; such as affordable housing, service provision, and parks. The car parking spaces that remain can be used to tackle the inadequate electric car-charging facilities that exist currently. Install and offer free electric vehicle charging points in all remaining car parks and see how quickly Southend becomes an eco-tourism hotspot and benefits from the many new visitors.\nTHE GREEN VIEW\nIt is evident from experience that only the Green Party can be trusted to deliver the radical measures needed to solve our traffic nightmares and to implement a financially and environmentally responsible solution that works in everyone’s interests, delivering the much-needed investment in low-carbon transport infrastructure our town needs.\nWe commit to completely overhauling our patchy and unreliable bus networks through greater partnership with the borough’s bus operators, and we will deliver unprecedented investment into cycling infrastructure, with new routes and street furniture, allowing for the swift and clean cross-town transit that our residents deserve.\nWe will additionally aid our town’s taxi fleet to modernise, investigating council-backed grants for local taxi firms to invest in new green electric vehicles, giving town-centre priority to electric taxis with newly designated ranks, and by additionally making disability awareness training mandatory for our town’s taxi drivers.\nThis is of course only a small insight into the many significant improvements that could be made to Southend. We have a clear opportunity to make Southend an area fit for the future, and we genuinely believe that our Manifesto is the most rational, most effective, and most responsible roadmap to becoming the pioneering community we all know it can be. Like Brighton, with the kind of dedication and ambition the Greens are known for, seaside towns like ours can become global leaders.\nMeeting the ever-changing needs of our community is a task made more difficult by having a Local Authority without sufficient vision or determination to make the necessary changes to take us forward.\nWhen elected, we will bring about a major shift in the direction of our town, and we will deliver the biggest change in council priorities in a century.\nYou can read our full range of ideas on Sustainable Infrastructure & Better Transport in Our Manifesto.\nFurther Reading & Sources:\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-suffolk-56406943\nhttps://www.ft.com/content/c1a53744-90d5-4560-9e3f-17ce06aba69a\nhttps://londonlivingstreets.com/policies-that-london-councils-can-implement-now-to-decarbonise-road-transport/\nhttp://www.oecd.org/officialdocuments/publicdisplaydocumentpdf/?cote=ENV/WKP(2019)4&docLanguage=En\nDepartment for Transport, dataset TSGB0106: People entering central London during the morning peak, since 1996 (Download: 14.5KB)",

On the theme of nativity and fear of not being left in a stable, the need for good quality affordable housing is as relevant now as it was 2,000 years ago.\nI’ll start from where I left off in my last viewpoint with the alarming decision by the Salvation Army to put forward their land at Hadleigh, which borders Leigh-on-Sea, for options consultation in the Castle Point emerging local plan. To clarify, this is a process whereby landowners put forward their land for appraisal by the local authority, it is not yet determined whether this land will be acceptable for development.\nNevertheless, the fight is on to protect this area of outstanding natural beauty adjacent to the historic monument of Hadleigh Castle, a SSSi, and the beautiful natural landscape that surrounds its majestic setting. Myself and Stuart last week met members of the Save Hadleigh Farm to listen to the key concerns. Such is residents outrage, an 8,000 signature petition of objection was delivered to Castle Point Offices on Friday morning.\nThe Greenbelt act was implemented for the purpose of stopping urban conurbations from expanding and merging into each other. This is an important factor in keeping openness and a strong sense of place, I strongly believe Hadliegh Farm is sacrosanct and should be protected from what is a completely illogical decision from the SA American HQ to put the land forward for consultation.\nAside from the ancient monument and SSSi, the other stupidity of such a proposal, if it were considered by Castle Point, is that the land is a long way from train stations and public transport hubs, creating more car dependency that will invariably be travelling to the main trunk roads of the A13 and A130. Most of our roads are already at 98% capacity, It would be more logical to develop Land to the West of Castle Point closest to the trunk roads that serve it. This should be Castle Points priority in creating more sustainable transport solutions and acknowledging the need for multi-modal options.\nAnother important quality in urban design and town planning is the spaces between buildings – The space between Hadleigh and Leigh along the London Road affords an important vista across the landscape to the Thames estuary, giving people a sense of human scale and orientation in the landscape – we all marvel at it and it should remain protected.\nOf course, the pen is mightier than the sword, and legislation is mightier than campaigning alone. One way of protecting land from developers is under the localism act whereby residents can form Neighbourhood Planning groups under national planning policy framework (NPPF). ‘Neighbourhood Plans’ can be put forward and, once approved, would be Integrated within local planning policy that ultimately gives residents control over their neighbourhood and how it is developed. Setting one up would be an essential first step. It is also worth mentioning the important publication of the Local Nature Recovery Strategy, LNRS, published by Essex County Council of which Hadleigh farm would be essential for Nature and biodiversity recovery.\nOf course, we have the same problem in Southend of the increasing population and demand for housing putting pressure on green and inappropriate sites.\nPreviously I wrote about the council’s decision to drawdown £12 million to built 30 council houses on the questionable location of the former cattery site. Not satisfied with the answers provided, I asked to see the monitoring equipment for noise and air pollution, yet to be seen. Notwithstanding this, reading an article on the 700,000 empty homes in England I made an enquiry into how many empty homes there are in Southend. The answer was around 1,700 and we have a dedicated officer to bring those properties back to market. Our empty homes officer should be commended as this year alone she has thus-far brought 40 to market. My point is that councils should be buying up these empty houses to help address a pressing need for affordable housing in the city. They should also be thinking very carefully where they choose to build, as once developed, land is gone forever. The Green Party maintain building the right houses in the right location, for Southend that has to be higher density around the major transport hubs.\nTwo weeks ago we approved the long anticipated 557 flats development of Alexander house, a high quality design by reputable architects and adjacent to major bus and train transport hubs. I was asked onto BBC Essex last week as there was much ado about the 0.5 car park space allocation per flat, which would have been zero had it been in central Chelmsford or London. Yet here in Southend, one of the most high density populated areas in Europe with no less than eight mainline London train stations compared to Chelmsford‘s of just one, people are concerned that more parking wasn’t approved. It doesn’t take a mathematician to work out that we can’t keep building hundreds of flats in a concentrated area each with a parking space – Southend, as any other city, doesn’t have the road capacity.",

Regular meetings take place in different areas focusing on a group of wards. Last night’s meeting was focussed on the town centre wards of Kursaal, Milton, and Victoria.\nOver thirty people attended the meeting; including a mix of local residents, ward councillors, and representatives from community groups.\nThe meeting opened with a brief report of local crime statistics which would suggest there has been a reduction in crime in the local area:\n| Ward | Last Year | Current Year |\n| Victoria Ward | 808 | 794 |\n| Milton Ward | 1612 | 1349 |\n| Kursaal Ward | 861 | 889 |\nRobberies are down in all 3 wards, while dwelling burglaries have fallen in Kursaal and Milton wards but have increased in Victoria Ward from last year.\nIn the 8 weeks since the last meeting, there has been no increase in either Victoria or Kursaal Wards but an increase in Milton Ward.\nThe Police spoke of several local initiatives that had been dealing with local issues such as prostitution, whereby a combination of patrols working in a multi-agency approach has been treating Women as victims and not as offenders to try and tackle the issue.\nReassuring residents after the recent number of stabbings in the Town Centre, the Police also spoke of other local operations which have recently seen an increase in on-the-street Police presence in the areas around the High Street and The Forum.\nAlso recently deployed were initiatives such as the controversial Stop and Search powers (weapons searches) and a close working partnership with the Active Citizens.\nOver the next couple of months, the Police are planning several Action Days with similar week-long events, with the Only Cowards Carry group is also scheduled to visit The Forum to engage with the youth in the area soon.\nThe meeting took place in a circular format and everyone was given the opportunity to raise any issues that they wanted to bring to the meeting.\nThe meeting saw most of the attendees raising the same issue about different locations across the three wards; Drug dealing and Drug Use on our streets.\nDetails were taken of the locations that were raised as being issues, and the police and community teams were subsequently keen to increase patrols and engagement in the areas raised.\nIt was decided at the meeting that the issue of Drugs would be a priority going forward for policing in Victoria, Milton, and Kursaal Wards.\nThe Police assured attendees that they would be accountable and would answer all questions about priority and other issues at future meetings.\nThe next meeting for these three wards will be held at 19:00 on Monday 30 July.\nDetails of meetings for this and other areas can be found at:\nhttps://www.essex.police.uk/your-area/southend/\nFurther Reading:\nhttp://www.echo-news.co.uk/news/16193352.Police_boss_admits_town_centre_needs_more_officers/",
  "https_southeastessex_greenparty_org_uk_/https_southeastessex_greenparty_org_uk_news_2021_05_10_petition-shoebury-green-belt/content_181.html": "The South East Essex Green Party have today launched a petition to stop the destruction of 1460 acres (2.28 sq miles) of Green Belt land to the north of Bournes Green and North Shoebury.\nFollowing recent reports of the scheme in the local media, widespread public concern has been raised about the proposed development which would see some of the last green belt lands in the borough concreted over.\nAn area of 5.9km2 has been touted as development potential for up to 7254 homes, creating a “new neighbourhood” between Sutton Road at its West and Star Lane at its East.\nIn further documents seen by the Green Party, the advisory document to the council on the area, reads: “Sector D has potential for strategic scale development” but that “this could not be achieved without significant investment in transport infrastructure”.\nIt is clear to us that this land is being teed up for vast swathes of new housing estates, and such a development would also likely be brought alongside the Rochford Outer Bypass which forms a core component of the Southend 2050 Vision.\nWhilst the council has made it clear that this planning assessment is only provisional at this stage, we can’t help but agree with residents that it has made Southend Council’s future intentions for this area crystal clear.\nThe Green Party oppose this scheme, and have launched a campaign of residents against this destruction.\n1. More sustainable housing options are available, but are not being sought.\nSuch a drastic loss of green belt land at a time of climate and ecological emergency is reckless, dangerous, and irresponsible. At a time of unprecedented destruction of our natural environment, we should be protecting and rewilding our green spaces, not building over them. Covering fields in concrete for the sake of growth is not progress.\nHundreds of hectares of previously agricultural and wildland, one of the few remaining havens for whole ecosystems of wildlife in our town, will be destroyed in the endless and mindless expansion ambitions of the town planners. This is simply not acceptable.\nIn further comments in the local media, the council reiterated that the need for such a development is bound by the national government’s blanket-approach housing targets and that the land would likely be sacrificed to meet the legislative requirements imposed on the council by the government, either by consent or by force.\nWhat the council seems to be conveniently overlooking is that the town has plenty of room for development within the already-saturated confines of the borough. Far more sustainable opportunities for new housing exist on the 51 sites of brownfield land across the borough. Instead of earmarking these brownfield sites for new sustainable higher-density affordable housing, we instead have proposals for new car parks, new shopping centres, and white elephant vanity projects. This is not what our town needs.\nFor perspective, Southend is already 65% developed on; compared to Colchester (a City similar in size) is just 11% developed on.\nWe can meet the growing need for increased housing supply in a genuinely affordable and sustainable manner, but yet again our climate-complacent councillors are looking to build on our green spaces for a quick fix.\n2. You can’t sustainably build more homes without also creating new jobs, new services, and new amenities.\nSuch a ‘new neighbourhood’ would impose incredible additional strain on our local services, schools, and GPs if the new development is built without adequate amenities – as these new high-profit developments so often are.\nA significant majority of any new housing built on this site would also likely be high-profit, low quality, “luxury commuter homes” built for the benefit of property developers, not local residents. Just look at the Conservative-planned and Labour-backed Queensway scheme for a glimpse of what will happen here too.\nNo consultation has yet taken place as to how the new estate will impact the lives of those living in the areas adjacent, nor has any assessment been made about the effects of climate-change-related sea level rise on the area proposed. Such a scheme could result in unwanted mansions built on land soon to be underwater.\nSt Luke’s is an area already chronically poor of local jobs and services, and we fear that the thoughts of local residents won’t be taken into consideration in any proposals.\n3. The construction of a Rochford Outer Bypass will result in huge parts of South East Essex becoming urban sprawl.\nThe previous Conservative administration at Southend Council put the construction of a Rochford Outer Bypass at the core of its Southend 2050 Vision, and the current Labour/Liberal/Independent administration doesn’t seem to have offered a different opinion either.\nThe proposed road, which would link the A130 by Battlesbridge, around Rochford, to conveniently the site of this new large estate would additionally green-light hundreds of hectares of green belt and agricultural land around Rochford, Ashingdon, and Hullbridge for new housing development.\nThe South East Essex Green Party has previously campaigned against this proposed bypass, and news of this new housing development reaffirms our concerns. It is our view that the construction of this new estate in North Shoebury would by necessity give planning consent to this destructive bypass, and will in effect be signing the forms that will wave goodbye to any remaining wild and agricultural land in South East Essex.\nAlongside this mindless environmental vandalism would also come the problems of a significant increase in congestion, pollution, and a worsening of the town’s already illegally poor air quality. A new road would not alleviate any traffic congestion, but would through induced demand, actually increase the numbers of vehicles travelling to and from the town, worsening congestion and pollution in other areas.\nGiving planning consent to this new development will likely result in the construction of the new bypass, and equally, giving consent to the bypass would result in hundreds of thousands of new buildings constructed on formerly green land.\nThe Green party oppose this scheme in the strongest possible terms, and we have launched a petition against it.\nWe call on every Southend Councillor to join our calls to block this scheme.\nWe will be publishing the names of those councillors who support and oppose this scheme.\nFurther Reading:\nhttps://www.echo-news.co.uk/news/19278802.blueprint-7-200-homes-southend-rochford/\nhttps://bettertransport.org.uk/roads-nowhere/bypasses-dont-work",

In its now-open consultation, Southend Borough Council said;\n“We are currently considering the introduction of a Selective Licensing scheme within parts of the borough with known anti-social behaviour (ASB), poor property conditions, high crime levels and deprivation.\nIt is proposed to designate the identified areas in the wards of Milton, Kursaal, Victoria and Chalkwell for selective licensing.”\nThe closing date for the public consultation is 11 January 2021.\nhttps://yoursay.southend.gov.uk/selective-licensing-southend\nThe Green View:\nThe Green Party has been advocating for a compulsory Landlord Licensing Scheme in Southend for many years, and this is welcome news from Southend Council.\nWe believe that such a scheme is a useful tool in tackling the problems of rogue landlords and seeking to remedy uninhabitable and substandard private rented accommodation that is becoming rife across Southend.\nSuch a scheme allows the Council to ensure that private rented homes meet acceptable safety standards, such as ensuring that homes have a valid Gas Safety certificate, that electrical appliances are safe and in working order, and that every home has a working smoke alarm.\nWe strongly believe that such a scheme, if properly implemented and administered, could improve the lives and living conditions for many residents across the borough, and this is a welcome step forward.\nHowever, we question why this scheme is not being rolled out across the whole borough, and why only certain areas in town will benefit from having this scheme implemented?\nThe Council concerningly cites deprivation indices, crime statistics, and Antisocial Behaviour (ASB) hotspots as the sole metrics for the targeted approach that is being proposed. Areas falling within the boundaries of the proposed licensing scheme do not follow traditional Ward boundaries and specifically highlight ‘problem’ areas across the town.\nThe only problem with that methodology being …\nAreas within Leigh, Southchurch, St Luke’s, Prittlewell, and St Laurence have areas of similarly-qualifying antisocial behaviour problems that would be excluded from this scheme;\nBelfairs, West Leigh, Leigh, St Laurence, Prittlewell, Westborough, St Luke’s, and Thorpe all have areas that (according to the council’s own supplementary data) have housing that falls into the lowest category of property conditions, but that would also be excluded from this scheme;\nand Blenheim, St. Laurence, Westborough, St. Luke’s, Southchurch, Shoeburyness, and West Shoebury all have areas of deprivation equal to those areas within the scheme that too would be excluded.\nSo surely if the scheme was being driven solely by the metrics, then those areas identified by the council in its own research as meeting the criteria of need for such a scheme, would also be included?\nThe question then is, why are these areas being excluded from this scheme, and why is the council’s focus solely on the town centre wards of Chalkwell, Milton, Kursaal, and Victoria?\nCould it perhaps be down to a loophole in the regulations that mean that proposed selective licensing schemes which cover less than 20% of the authority’s area, (or, affect fewer than 20% of privately rented homes) do not require approval from the Secretary of State?\nWhatever the reason behind excluding the other 13 wards across town is, it will result in a disparity in housing protections for residents; with some being protected against rogue landlords and given assurances of basic housing standards, and others not, purely based on postcode.\nWe are concerned that a big opportunity to roll out a genuinely beneficial borough-wide Landlord Licensing scheme is being missed. If such a scheme offers the many benefits the council believes it does, why is it only being afforded to select residents?\nAs the scheme is being run on a cost-neutral basis, with the town’s Landlords picking up the cost for the administration for the scheme instead of the Council coffers, beyond asking the Secretary of State for approval, what is stopping the Council from rolling out this scheme to every private-renting resident across town?\nWe would argue that there is as much of a need for landlord licensing in Shoeburyness and St. Luke’s as there is in Chalkwell, and by extension, surely it is unfair for rented residents of areas like Belfairs or Thorpe to not be offered the same basic protections of housing safety based on calculations made on ward-by-ward ASB and Crime Statistics.\nWhat we Believe\nOur priority lies in delivering guarantees of basic living standards for all residents, and we don’t believe that where you live should result in a difference in what protections you’re afforded as a private rented tenant.\nEverybody should have access to a safe, warm, and efficient place to call home. By limiting this proposed scheme to just four out of seventeen wards, a majority of Southend’s private-rented tenants will not benefit from this.\nWe call on Southend Borough Council to reevaluate the scope of this scheme and be bolder in its ambition. We call for such a Landlord Licensing Scheme to benefit every tenanted resident across town, regardless of area.\nWe encourage Green Party members and supporters to participate in the Council’s consultation and to push for parity in living standards across town.\nWe proudly advocate for a whole-borough compulsory Landlord Licensing scheme in Our Local Manifesto, and this is also echoed in the Green Party’s national policy:\nHO523: To tackle rogue and slum landlords, the Green Party would simplify and toughen up the Housing Health and Safety Rating System (HHSRS), ensure local authorities dedicate adequate resources to proactively enforce it, and introduce a national landlord licensing scheme, with the enforcement of licenses operated by local authorities and punitive penalties for landlords who fail to gain a license or meet the HHSRS requirements. We would also tackle landlords converting homes into unsuitable dwellings and then obtaining a Lawful Development Certificate by giving local authorities 10 years to take enforcement action, rather than 4 years as at present.\n>> You can read the Green Party’s full position on Housing here:\nFurther Reading:\nhttps://yoursay.southend.gov.uk/selective-licensing-southend\nhttps://england.shelter.org.uk/legal/housing_conditions/selective_licensing\nhttps://www.pace-properties.com/selective-licensing-launch-to-cost-50000",

Our parks, open spaces, and the Prittle Brook Greenway have given people the opportunity to safely exercise and reconnect with nature over the past year.\nSouthend is one of the most densely populated areas in the UK, and as such our green spaces are vitally important.
