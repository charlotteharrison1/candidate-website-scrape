Campbell Park Parish Council are offering free hot food and drinks, sockets for charging phones and laptops, and wi-fi access.\nWith soaring energy bills, rising food costs, and inflation near a 40-year high, the extra funding will ensure the City Council can continue to help the communities that need it the most.\nCouncillor Jane Carr, Lib Dem Progressive Alliance Cabinet Member for the cost-of-living crisis, added:\n\"The cost-of-living crisis has caused families to make difficult financial decisions, and with food and energy costs through the roof, many have been plunged into poverty. The Progressive Alliance is committed to helping our vulnerable residents through this crisis and working with parish councils to provide community support is one of the best ways to do that. Parish councils across MK do a brilliant job in the community and we hope this extra funding will enable them to open new and continue existing services. I hope my fellow councillors will support this budget so we can continue to help those who are most in need.\"\nIn October the City Council declared a cost-of-living emergency and set up a multi-million-pound Winter Plan to help the city's residents through the cost-of-living crisis.\nIf the budget is approved the City Council will provide millions of pounds in direct cost-of-living support including help with paying council tax, rent, and energy bills.",

People are being left waiting weeks to get an appointment only to be rushed through in a matter of minutes.”\nEarlier this month figures revealed that there are 2,720 patients for every GP across Milton Keynes and the surrounding areas.\nLib Dem Leader and Deputy Leader of the City Council, Councillor Robin Bradburn added:\n“Entire communities are paying the price for years of neglect under the Conservatives, who have driven local health services into the ground.

Their actions over less than a month since the last General Election already show they aren't.\nMPs Get Extra Holiday for Nothing\nJacob Rees-Mogg has already announced that Johnson's Conservative government is giving MPs an extra month's holiday on top of the time off they received in 2019. This will mean that many Tory MPs who have second jobs paying even more than the £77k salary for being an MP will be able to spend even less of their time serving the public. Their decision means Parliament being in recess for at least 64 days in 2020, far more time off than the 28 days holiday normal hard working members of the public receive. (click here for more detail)\nThe Hard Working Public Get Broken Promises\nAs well as giving MPs extra time off for nothing, in its recent Queen's speech the Conservative Government confirmed that it may break it's General Election promise of a £10.50 minimum wage (click here for more detail) for the lowest paid workers, people who work hard long hours doing jobs like caring for the elderly or working in stressful warehouses. Many Conservative MPs who get generous expenses on top of subsidised food and alcohol when in Parliament are already showing they will look after themselves before looking after hard working members of the public.\nA Government Avoiding Scrutiny\nAs well as backbench Tory MPs getting more time off, these changes also mean that Boris Johnson will avoid Prime Minister's Questions more in 2020, and the Conservative Government has reduced the time available for Lib Dem and other MPs to challenge the government. This will be important as we need our hard working opposition MPs to challenge trade deals which may allow unsafe items into the UK, and to hold the government to account for its broken promises.\nLess than a month after the General Election this is already a government for themselves against the people.",

The measure would prevent pensioners being forced to \"choose between eating and heating this winter\", say the Lib Dems.\nThe call comes amid fears that local residents, particularly 4,245 pensioners on low incomes, could be at risk from the energy crisis this winter.\nThe Warm Home Discount, funded by energy firms, is due to give people £140 off their electricity bill this winter. It is available to those who receive the 'Guarantee Credit' element of pension credit as well as some people on low incomes, with around two million receiving it each year across the UK.\nThe Liberal Democrats are calling on the Government to take on the cost of the Warm Home Discount and immediately double its value to £280, helping pensioners cope with soaring bills this winter.\nCurrently £501,200 is spent on the Warm Home Discount in Milton Keynes. Under Liberal Democrat plans this funding would rise to £1,188,600.\nCommenting on the new scheme, Liberal Democrat Group Leader on Milton Keynes Council, Councillor Robin Bradburn, said:\n\"The Conservatives are pushing the most vulnerable pensioners and families into a cost of living crisis.

Funding secured this way has been used to improve playparks in West Bletchley, install pedestrian crossings in Oakgrove and display public art for the Women’s Euros.\nThe City Council’s Tariff system and developer contributions combined are on track to secure millions of pounds for infrastructure across the city which includes free land for schools, playparks, and green spaces.\nHowever, the Government’s proposal intends to scrap the existing system and replace it with the Infrastructure Levy which prohibits the City Council from securing funding for infrastructure through their current approach.

The Liberal Democrats are serious in the commitment that infrastructure must be built before homes go in, and that infrastructure must include more future 'blue' infrastructure like balancing lakes, just as those who planned Milton Keynes included Willen Lake, Caldecotte lake and other proactive defenses for the future city.\nWe can't just focus on the long term future however, as shown by recent flooding we must also do more now with what we currently have. Our councillors thought about ways we can help protect residents and their homes now.\nSince the flooding in December our councillors have:\n- Succeeded in winning a budget amendment for £15,000 to help train and equip a network of volunteer flood wardens across MK, who would have the knowledge and equipment to take local action to protect streets, as well as contacts to raise awareness quickly\n- Spoken to a range of agencies responsible for rivers and lakes across Milton Keynes like Anglian Water, the Environment Agency and IDB to ensure they respond quickly when there is heavy rain or a quickly rising river, as (for example) opening the intake into a balancing lake quickly might be the difference between homes being flooded or not (see video of Cllr McPake asking about this at council)\n- Been pursuing the dredging of rivers where it is necessary to help protect homes, as Conservative Central Government cuts have resulted in agencies reducing the frequency of dredging\n- Successfully made changes to the Strategic MK 2050 plan for how MK will develop to ensure there are references to future balancing lakes and other strategic defenses to protect homes, as part of the agreement with government about infrastructure necessary before building takes place, necessary as developers will often resist contributing to major infrastructure when submitting permission to build new developments\nThese achievements show that the Liberal Democrats are working hard for residents of MK, on large issues affecting the whole city, and looking after the interests and needs of residents locally. The best future for Milton Keynes will be delivered by having more Liberal Democrat councillors.\nIf you're interested in community flood groups or becoming a flood warden, please contact Cllr Jane Carr at Jane.Carr@milton-keynes.gov.uk",

Cllr Carr was also able to reach a national audience, after her letter about the importance of community flood groups was read out on BBC Radio 2.\n\"Community groups and flood wardens are crucial, because it's the residents themselves who are first on the scene.\", says Cllr Carr. \"These groups deserve advice and resources, so they're better equipped to help their community. I'll be fighting for this on the Council.\"\nIn the (virtual) Council Chamber, Liberal Democrat Group Leader Councillor Douglas McCall warned the Council that this issue is not going to go away, but will only worsen with climate change.\nCouncillor McCall emphasised that the Strategy for 2050, which sets the way for the city's future, must include references to balancing lakes, river maintenance and assessments of old drainage networks.\nLiberal Democrat Environment Spokesperson, Councillor Vanessa McPake, pushed Cabinet to investigate problems with the opening of gates to balancing lakes, as currently permission from the Environment Agency is required. Balancing lakes are critical in holding flood waters.\n\"I will be raising the flooding issues again at the next meeting of the regional Environment Agency, as all the waterways which flooded in January were ones maintained by the Environment Agency.\", says Cllr McPake.\n\"After what happened in December, residents can be assured we're not letting this go.\", concludes Cllr McPake.\nIf you're interested in community flood groups or becoming a flood warden, please contact Cllr Jane Carr at Jane.Carr@milton-keynes.gov.uk",

Women and girls have the right to feel safe in our city and as a licensing authority we should do all that we can to address this. Going forward, we want to ensure drivers get the correct training before being granted a license.”\nMilton Keynes City Council currently licenses approximately 1,500 drivers to provide private hire and hackney carriage services for residents in the city.\nHowever, once a license is acquired, a driver can operate anywhere in England as long as they are licensed with an operator in a corresponding local authority area. This means that a large proportion of drivers operating in the city are licensed by other Councils.\nThe City Council will also work with operators to encourage their drivers to promote the White Ribbon campaign and write to Transport for London and other local authorities whose drivers operate in Milton Keynes to encourage them to take a similar approach.\nCouncillor Sophie Bell, who represents Shenley Brook End, added:\n“It’s concerning to hear that a high number of women have experienced inappropriate behaviour from drivers, but as all women know it’s not uncommon to be made to feel uncomfortable by offensive remarks or behaviour. I’m glad that positive steps will now be taken to raise awareness of the campaign amongst drivers, as this will allow women and girls to feel safe when travelling in taxis that display the White Ribbon.”\nWhite Ribbon is a global campaign that encourages people, especially men and boys to challenge behaviour and change the culture that leads to abuse and violence against women.\nPositive action by the City Council led to it becoming White Ribbon Accredited in 2022. It offers guidance and training for colleagues, provides housing and support services for women and children who need to flee violence and abuse and has a range of measures to improve safety on the streets and in schools for local women and girls.\nThe City Council has also been establishing a network of male ambassadors and female champions among its employees and councillors to promote the message and raise awareness.",

Thank you to everyone who lent us their votes this time.\nVote change gives a clearer picture of what has happened, with a 7.5% increase for parties which campaigned on a 'no deal' Brexit, with Lib Dems, Greens and Change UK taking support from both Labour and Conservatives for a much bigger surge for parties which clearly oppose Brexit.\nOverall the parties which oppose Brexit outperformed parties which campaigned for a no-deal Brexit by 39.5% to 36.2%. The Tory and Labour parties which have been pushing for some sort of compromise deal (or which had just been unclear!) were given 23.4% of the vote.\nThe Liberal Democrats in Milton Keynes and across the UK ran a positive campaign making the case that the best future for the UK is in the EU, and that we should Stop Brexit!

We'll continue to support these kinds of initiatives and we actively encourage other local agencies, town and parish councils to join the scheme with SOFEA.\"\nCllr Zoe Nolan, Cabinet Member for Children and Families said:\n\"This is the first time an MK Council children or family centre has hosted a SOFEA community food larder project. Our fantastic team at Moorlands Family Centre in Beanhill engages with thousands of people every year so I anticipate the new partnership being really well-used and liked by local families who visit the centre.\"\nThe Moorlands Community Food Larder will be open from next week and access is granted through SOFEA's flexible membership schemes starting from as little as £3.50 per week, which would provide up to £15 worth of subsidised fresh food and drink.

Lib Dem Cllr Subhan Shafiq, as a friend, attended as a character witness to the driver's current good character.

Funding will also be provided to employ three apprentices that will be trained a Level 7 town planner qualification.\nThe plans will be put to the next Cabinet in early February as part of a programme that is designed to improve the planning service after a number of concerns have been raised in the last few years.\nThe proposals will also include additional budget funding for planning enforcement improvements and to provide more training and communication materials on the planning rules for conservation areas and permitted development to help reduce potential problems early before they become the source of local issues and complaints.\nCllr Peter Marland, Leader of Milton Keynes Council said:\n\"Milton Keynes is iconic for planning and urban design. We are absolutely determined to provide local residents with an excellent planning service. Our plans will see us using our national status for sustainable growth to attract new and the best planners to the city, provide the best on the job training in the country and develop national best practice by working with the best institutes and planning bodies.\"\nHe continued:\n\"We know that a few issues have led to people questioning the service we provide. We are totally committed to restoring trust and improving the planning services the council provides. The reality is that attracting good planners is hard in a fiercely competitive market with lots of demand for planners from a large private sector and other public sector bodies. We need to show that coming to work for Milton Keynes Council is a good thing, as well as retaining our current employees, and our academy plans will help do that. We will also propose more funding to help improve our enforcement service and help people better understand issues surrounding permitted development rights to try and prevent issues before they arise.\"\nHe concluded:\n\"Our planning services are moving forward. The planning academy and additional funding for the service will mean we continue to improve.\"",

So he was thrilled to get a very warm welcome at a massive rally on Monday afternoon.\nAs soon as he came out on stage at Westminster's Central Hall, the deputy prime minister was greeted by huge cheers and applause by a 2,200-strong crowd. Dozens of people stood up to take photos as a young boy promptly came on stage to present him with flowers. Clegg, used to receiving a kicking from the public, couldn't keep the smile off his face.\nHis reception at the event, staged by community-organising charity Citizens UK, was a far cry from the taunting and teasing he has long suffered in the House of Commons and the mainstream media. He has long been cast as the villain: the man who broke the Lib Dems' key promise not to raise tuition fees. Here he was treated almost a hero.\nThis was a hall packed to the rafters with people from churches, mosques, schools, colleges, and social justice groups. Clegg was visibly astonished as an activist started reeling off all the commitments the Lib Dem leader made to a previous meeting Citizens UK and had delivered on. Capping the cost of credit from payday lenders and ending the immigration detention of children topped the list.\n\"We know how hard you fought to make this happen,\" said the activist. \"Mr Clegg, I'm proud of what we've achieved together. We thank you and the Liberal Democrat party.\"\nA thrilled Clegg watched the audience erupt into applause.\nLike the two other politicians who attended the event - culture secretary Sajid Javid and Labour leader Ed Miliband - Clegg was then given just four minutes to make his pitch for why people should vote for the Lib Dems.\nBut unlike the others, he asked if he could say something first: \"Before the four minutes, can I just… Because I'm so used to being told what I haven't been able to deliver, so I'm slightly overwhelmed.\"\nA 13-year-old boy came on stage to thank Clegg personally for making sure his father - a cleaner in Whitehall - was paid the living wage. \"Thank you, Nick Clegg, for what you did for my dad,\" he said. \"You should help everyone to get the living wage because it helps society to grow and helps people to live their lives.\"\nThis is not the normal reception the Lib Dem leader receives.\nClegg was asked if he would commit to meeting Citizens UK once a year if he stayed in office. \"If every time I meet you, you bring flowers, I'd like to meet you more than once a year!\" he replied, beaming.\nNot everyone greets Clegg with a bunch of flowers. His party is set to lose around half its MPs in Thursday's election. But he will no doubt treasure this as a very special moment in a long and gruelling election campaign.\nEmily Ashton is a senior political correspondent for BuzzFeed News and is based in London.\nContact Emily Ashton at emily.ashton@buzzfeed.com",

Because of this policy, accommodation is offered to every person sleeping on the streets.\n- Fight back against government changes to the planning system if the proposals disempower local authorities and silence the views of local residents.\n<hr/ />\nInvest in our city's resilient economy and balance the Council's budget\n- Work to balance the Council's budget for another year.\n- Support and develop the existing multi-million-pound Economic Recovery Plan for Milton Keynes. Our city's economy was recently ranked as one of the strongest in the country, and we will make sure it stays that way by continuing to attract inward investment, and actively participating in the Business Forum.\n- Continue investing in our high streets, regenerating our older towns, and funding innovative business support schemes, such as allowing new business owners and entrepreneurs to use empty units owned by the Council.\n<hr/ />\nProvide support for local children, families, and communities\n- Campaign for enough school places and Special Educational Needs and Disability support for our children.

We have some fantastic charities and local projects in Milton Keynes that can provide people with the valuable support they need, so we want to take this opportunity to reassure residents that support is available, and nobody should suffer in silence.”\nLast year the City Council invested £110,000 in local projects to tackle mental health inequalities across the city.\nIf you want to seek advice and support for your mental health, there are several local charities and organisations who can help:\n- Central North West London NHS Foundation Trust offer mental health services across Milton Keynes for people of all ages\n- The Adult Care and Health Directory has information about local community services and the Mental Health and Autism Social Care Team\n- Bedford, Luton & Milton Keynes Clinical Commissioning Group directory has information on mental health services and resources in Milton Keynes\n- Milton Keynes Talking Therapies Service (IAPT) are effective and confidential treatments delivered by fully trained and accredited NHS practitioners.

But with over 1100 families expected to be homeless in MK – the highest average ever, the new homes we need must be genuinely affordable. But it’s not just homes. Without a stable home, people’s health, education, and job prospects are seriously affected. The Government must do better.”\nLib Dem Leader, Councillor Jane Carr, added:\n“Clearly Britain is in an affordable housing crisis, but this is not just a political issue, it’s about fairness and dignity. The New Year is an opportunity to change the course and give residents new hope for affordable housing before more people are priced out of their communities. The Government must now make this their priority and deliver the funding required to provide the 150,000 genuinely affordable homes we need nationally every year.”",

In the last year MK Council has housed 687 families, including 1013 children, in temporary accommodation costing over £7.5M! This doesn't include the dozens of 'non-statutory' street homeless.\nThere is much concern about the Government's decision to remove Housing Benefit from 18-21 year olds from April. We can expect more teenage street homeless due to this policy as only the Winter Night Shelter takes in homeless people who cannot claim housing benefit, and they only operate over the winter months.\nThe route of the problem is a severe shortage of social housing, caused by the Government's policy of selling off Council Houses for over 30 years, and extremely high private rents in MK.\nTackling homelessness and providing more social housing is a top priority for the Liberal Democrats, who have helped push the issue of homelessness up the political agenda and get tackling these issues as priorities for the Council.\nThe Council are looking at innovative ways to address this and I recently visited an amazing temporary home made from two shipping containers, which had a living room, kitchen are, bedroom and bathroom. There is also a three container version with two bedrooms. The Council plans to have five sites of 66 of these, the first one by November this year. This will be a major step in the right direction, and I am sure a family currently all in one room in Bed & Breakfast out of MK would much prefer one of these.",

As dementia becomes more and more common, we need to be making changes to our planning policies and built environment so that Milton Keynes can be a safe city for people with dementia.\"\nDementia friendly neighbourhoods may include features such as:\n- Housing designed for older people, such as sheltered housing or care homes, that is located within a 5 to 10-minute walk of local shops and services, including public transport\n- Streets that are short and not too wide\n- Signage that is minimal, and gives simple, essential information at decision points\n- Building entrances that are clearly visible, and the functions of buildings should be obvious\nCouncillor Emily Darlington, Labour Cabinet Member for Adults, Housing and Healthy Communities, has been working on the Council's Dementia Friendly City Strategy: \"There are currently 1,647 people living with dementia in Milton Keynes, and this is set to rise to 4,300 by 2030.

The fact that petrol is 10p cheaper in Cambridgeshire than it is in Milton Keynes is ridiculous. It's common for cities to have lower petrol prices but not the other way around. These prices are deeply unfair on residents and local businesses as they are having to fork out an extra 10p per litre for petrol. This means some families in Milton Keynes are paying on average over £300 more per year in fuel than a family living in Cambridgeshire. Something urgently needs to be done.\"\nAs well as higher petrol prices, residents who use their cars and vans for business will also be at a disadvantage as the Approved Mileage Allowance rate of 45p per mile has not changed since 2011 and no longer covers the cost of using your own car for business.\nIn January, the City Council recognised this and offered a one-off £300 payment to help ease costs for their employees who are required to complete essential high mileage car journeys as part of their job role. However, businesses cannot offer higher rates than 45p as employees are liable to pay more tax.\nLiberal Democrat Councillor Uroy Clarke will be seconding the motion, added:\n\"Employers in social care are having difficulty recruiting staff, and with the Approved Mileage Allowance rate unchanged at 45p since 2011, I can see why. Staff are out all day visiting those who need care, so fuel costs are generally high, but for those in Milton Keynes even higher. It's time this unfair taxation is stopped.\"\nThe rate of Approved Mileage Allowance is set by the Government, and recently the Association of Taxation Technicians who provide UK tax compliance services have called for a review.\nTomorrow night, the City Council will be asked to lobby local MPs Ben Everitt and Iain Stewart to assess what can be done to lower fuel prices for the residents of Milton Keynes and call for an increase in the 45p per mile rate.

He moved to MK in the early 1980s with his wife Irene and their two daughters, Hilary and Rebecca.\nAlan and Irene were founding members of the SDP. In 1985, the days of the SDP-Liberal Alliance, he became the candidate for the newly created Buckinghamshire County Council seat of Linford North (his opposite number in Linford South was John Wheaver).\nThe Linford Letter \"Election Extra\" of that year included a front-page letter signed by Alan. This was a hallmark piece that foreshadowed how he would approach his work on the County Council (1985-1997) and then on the unitary MK Council until 2007. Over several paragraphs he \"imagined\" better facilities and opportunities and concluded:\n\"Are these day-dreams? They are certainly dreams that cannot be realised under the grinding, uncompassionate, uncaring heel of the Tory government and a party that appeals only to individual selfishness and organised greed ... The time has come for a fresh start ... This time, at last, you can vote for what you really believe in.\"\nHis majority, with Labour in second place, was 303; in 1989 it was 237 over the Tories. In 1993, it shot up to 609, taking over 55% of the vote. When the elections for the new unitary MK Council took place in 1996, Alan, with his fellow LibDem candidate Bob Benning, topped the poll again with 58% of the vote. Further wins in 1999 and then in 2002, when the Liberal Democrats took control of the Council, saw more excellent majorities.\nAlan was elected Mayor of Milton Keynes for 2002-2003, the third Liberal Democrat, after Bruce Hardwick and Pat Seymour, to receive that accolade. This was a role in which he gave much and took great pride.\nAlan was not a highly political animal. His philosophy of life was firmly grounded in his Quaker faith. He measured his decisions with concern, empathy and respect for others - a good friend with a passion for fairness and justice. It was these qualities that spoke to local residents who continued to elect him over those years of service.\nHe called his service as a councillor to an end in 2007. In 2013, he and Irene moved to Sheffield to be near one of their daughters and two of their four grandchildren.\nAlan Pugh, born 24 March 1940, died on 22 January 2017.",

In Milton Keynes South, it is £3,028,912 between 17,651 pensioners.\nAnalysis by the Liberal Democrats has shown this broken promise will wipe out the \"paltry support\" being offered by the government to help pensioners cope with soaring energy bills. Even those pensioners who qualify for a council tax rebate will be left over £20 poorer in real terms, while those on the New State Pension will be left short-changed by £76.20. It means retirees in Milton Keynes are facing down a £773,543 gulf between their lost pension income and support, with that only gulf only set to widen further with the Bank of England forecasting inflation in April of 7.25%.\nMilton Keynes Liberal Democrats are calling on the Government to row back on their broken promise and guarantee a fairer increase to the state pension. The party is also calling for a doubling and expansion to the Warm Home Discount, giving 28,450 households in Milton Keynes £300 each off their heating bills this year & a doubling of the Winter Fuel Allowance, to the benefit of 23,520 households.\nLiberal Democrat Group Leader on Milton Keynes Council, Councillor Robin Bradburn, said:\n\"These figures expose a black hole in the Government's cost of living package for pensioners.\n\"In breaking their manifesto promise and failing to protect the state pension, the Conservatives have plunged older people in Milton Keynes into the depths of a cost of living crisis. Their paltry support doesn't even begin to cover the additional costs people are facing during this cold and bitter winter.\n\"Pensioners are among the most vulnerable people in Milton Keynes. This out of touch Government has left them out in the cold, with a hole in their pocket and even harsher days ahead.\n\"It's high time the Government showed some common sense and ensured a fair increase to the state pension.

Whilst public questions are already received at both Full Council and Cabinet meetings, there had previously been no specific provision for the newly elected Youth Council to participate in these discussions.\nThe motion which was passed unanimously also urged the City Council to explore ways Youth Councillors’ views can be embedded in policy development.\nAdditionally, the motion renewed the call for the Government to lower the voting age to 16 in its forthcoming elections bill this spring.\nLeader of Milton Keynes Liberal Democrats, Councillor Jane Carr, said:\n“We brought this motion to Council after listening to the thoughts and experiences of MK Youth Council. Our Youth Councillors are not only ambassadors for the Council, but also for Milton Keynes as a whole.

Young people care about politics, just not in the party-political sense we are used to. They campaign, protest and rally behind the causes they support, but often feel that standing up in a council chamber is an unreachable goal. The fact that 94 young people with some as young as 11 stood as candidates for this year’s Youth Council elections demonstrates just how willing they are to take on this responsibility.”\nLiberal Democrat councillors have long championed youth involvement in local government, having previously secured the appointment of Milton Keynes’ first ever Youth Mayor and consistently advocating for the voting age to be lowered to 16.",

Our worries which were raised by Cllr Douglas McCall include:\n- A fall in recycling rates.\n- Increasing fly tipping (which will make life worse for all residents).\n- An increase of food and garden waste in black sacks, which will increase costs for the council.\n- Increase in the waste in black sacks to the Waste Recovery Plant will reduce our ability to charge other authorities for the service.\n- Questions about what will happen to the unused green bins, since the council don't plan to collect them.\n- The collection vehicles will still drive along the same roads, but will be collecting less, so contract costs will likely remain the same.\n- Under their current predictions the charges will not start making money for the council until their third year, however if their assumptions are wrong it could be later.\nWe have also carried out some investigations, and while the Labour executive are assuming that 28% of eligible households will pay for green bin collections, Croydon council have advised that a similar charge in their area only had 13.8% take up last year. The same collection level in MK could lead to residents in our area facing even larger cuts to other services while receiving a worse service for waste collection!\nIn an Executive Scrutiny Committee meeting on 6th April our Liberal Democrat councillors led a successful challenge about the way the decision to charge for green bins had been made and lack of evidence for it, and the policy to charge has been referred for discussion at the next Full Council meeting.\nThe reasons to challenge the policy include a lack of consultation by the executive, ineffective scrutiny of the decision, widespread resident concerns, and questions if the expected savings will be achieved. Since the next Full Council meeting is not due until June, our councillors called for a special meeting of Full Council. The special meeting is currently planned for Wednesday 3rd May.\nDue to government legislation, Full Council does not have the power to overturn the Cabinet decision, only to ask them to think again, therefore we need your support to put more pressure on the council executive.\nThe petition will be given to the council as soon as the Full Council meet to discuss the concerns about the charge.\nTo show your support for our campaign, please sign our petition:\nwww.tinyurl.com/MK-GreenBins",

It can also be downloaded in full as a PDF by clicking here.\nCOVID-19 Foreword\nSince March 2020 Milton Keynes, along with the world, has been experiencing the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOur thoughts are with all those who have experienced illness and loss throughout the crisis.\nThe things that needed to be done in 2020, that may have been put on hold due to the pandemic, still need doing in 2021.\nThe COVID-19 situation is ongoing and ever changing. As such, we will make sure to adapt to the situation when we must.\nOur commitment to the people of Milton Keynes is constant. The Liberal Democrats will listen, care and work for you as we journey through this crisis together.\nForeword by Cllr Douglas McCall\nThe residents of Milton Keynes deserve a Council that listens to them. One that cares for them. One that works for them.\nSince the last elections the Liberal Democrats have been doing this; we've been listening, caring and working to create a bigger and better future for Milton Keynes.\nWe've led a local free school meals campaign, pushed the Council to support the Black Lives Matter movement and resisted the government's disastrous planning proposals. We've put a spotlight on the tragedy of child poverty and fought for online meetings to continue so that our Council is accessible and inclusive.\nHowever, more needs to be done. If the Liberal Democrats ran the Council, we would further reduce child poverty in our borough, and do everything we can to help people off the streets.\nWe will support our children and young people who are the future of our city, as well as making sure our older residents have the care they deserve.\nWe will work to make sure we have enough affordable housing in well looked after communities, and promote innovative public transport.\nWe'll help rebuild our local economy after the pandemic, and make sure that we earn the title of World's Greenest City.\nOf the many questions the COVID-19 pandemic has posed, perhaps the most crucial is do we want things to go back to 'normal'? Or do we want things to be better?\nIf you want a better future for Milton Keynes, vote Liberal Democrat on 6 May.\nCllr Douglas McCall,\nLeader of the Liberal Democrats on Milton Keynes Council\nWe delivered on what we promised in 2020\nSince 2016 we've been working in partnership with the Labour-run Council, meaning our manifesto is included in the Council Plan, including the one we prepared for 2020. We've been able to deliver some amazing successes, despite massive cuts from central government and the COVID-19 pandemic.\n| What we promised in 2020 | How we delivered |\n| Promote the take up of free school meals, and support lunch clubs during school holidays, so that no child goes hungry. | Secured £100,000 in the Council's 2021/22 budget to tackle child poverty, £30,000 of which is to go toward setting up community homework plus groups that provide a meal. |\n| Improve our streets by fixing potholes, clearing litter and removing weeds. | Fought for £100,000 in the 2021/22 budget to go towards new bins, including solar powered 'smart' bins. Pressured the Council in 2018 to change their pothole policy, so more potholes could be fixed. In 2017/18 there were 2,833 pothole enquiries. This fell to 1,491 in 2019/20. |\n| Balance the budget for another year and maintain Council reserves in the face of uncertain future central government funding. | Helped the administration balance the budget and maintain reserves, which proved crucial when the pandemic hit. |\n| Reduce flooding of our homes, streets and roads. | Changed the Council's Strategy for 2050 so it references balancing lakes, river maintenance and drainage networks. Secured £15,000 in the Council's 2021/22 budget for training and equipping volunteer flood wardens. |\n| Make sure the growth of our city is planned, so that the local Council has the final say, not developers. | Campaigned against the government's power grab on planning with a motion to Full Council. The government's proposals will disempower local authorities and silence the views of residents. Fought for £65,000 in the Council's 2021/22 budget for additional planning enforcement support. Supported the Council's Strategy for 2050, so that the future of our city is planned. |\nSince the last elections in May 2019, the Liberal Democrats have been listening to residents, and we've been working for them. Over the past two years the Liberal Democrats have:\nDemanded that the Child Poverty Commission be created.

This is a party delivering on commitments to the residents of MK.\nThe rest of this manifesto will focus on our commitments for the future, to make sure Milton Keynes is a good place to grow up and live for everyone across all of our many communities. The sections expand on our main 8 priorities:\n- Reduce child poverty,because every child deserves a good start in life.\n- Tackle unaffordable housing and homelessness, because everyone deserves a secure place to call home.\n- Help our children and young people, so they can thrive through their lives.\n- Fight for better health and social care, so that our residents have the support they need.\n- Look after our neighbourhoods, so they are tidy, safe and places that residents of MK can be proud of.\n- Improve and innovate our public transport, so public transport becomes a real choice for residents.\n- Rebuild the local economy and keep a balanced council budget, so that we have a stable recovery from COVID-19.\n- Create a carbon neutral Milton Keynes by 2030, so that we become a truly green city.\nReduce child poverty,because every child deserves a good start in life.\nWe believe the Council has a duty to be there for their residents, especially vulnerable children. The Child Poverty Commission found that over 22,000 children are in poverty in our city after housing costs are considered. We cannot and will not ignore this; it needs to be the Council's priority. The Liberal Democrats care about the children of Milton Keynes, and we will work for them.\nIf the Liberal Democrats ran the Council, we would:\nListen to the recommendations of the Child Poverty Commission, which was called for by the Liberal Democrats in 2019, so that the children of Milton Keynes can reach their full potential.\nPromote the take up of free school meals and support lunch provision during the school holidays. We will look into new ways to tackle child hunger, including the use of homework plus groups, where academic support is provided as well as food. We secured £30,000 in the Council's 2021/22 budget for this.\nLobby our MPs to fight for permanent changes to the free school meals system, so that no child goes hungry. We brought a motion on this to Council in November 2020 and wrote an open letter to our MPs asking that they do everything they can to enact real change.\nInvest in early parenting, because the first few years of a child's life are the most important in influencing their life chances.\nFight in-work poverty by remaining committed to the real Living Wage and affordable childcare.\nEncourage lifelong learning for residents who want more qualifications, working to increase job opportunities and tackle unemployment and poverty.\nSupport our amazing community initiatives that are working to tackle poverty and help vulnerable residents, such as MK Storehouse, MK Community Fridge, MK Food Bank and MK Act.\nTackle unaffordable housing and homelessness, because everyone deserves a secure place to call home.\nThe pandemic has shown just how important home is; it is much more than just a place to live. The Liberal Democrats want everyone in Milton Keynes to be able to have a safe, comfortable and affordable place to call home, but sadly that isn't the case currently.\nPeople are struggling due to high rents. Some face the risk of poverty and homelessness. Others lose any chance of getting onto the housing ladder. The Liberal Democrats have listened to these worries, and will work to resolve them.\nIf the Liberal Democrats ran the Council, we would:\nDevelop a housing company so the houses being built actually meet the needs of the people of Milton Keynes.\nSupport private renters by working with private landlords to encourage them to provide good and affordable housing.\nListen to residents' views about Council housing maintenance matters.\nMake sure the number of people in temporary accommodation continues to fall, which the Liberal Democrats have continuously pushed the Council on.\nImprove support for people who are at risk of becoming homeless.\nWork to ensure support for rough sleepers continues after the pandemic, including day and night accommodation solutions.\nContinue the 'Housing First' policy that the Liberal Democrats helped create in 2018. It has seen accommodation offered to every person sleeping on the streets, and 176 rough sleepers have now been accepted into housing.\nHelp our children and young people, so they can thrive through their lives.\nChildren and young people are the future of Milton Keynes. We want them to flourish in school and higher education. We want them to have support, whether through mental health services, family centres, libraries or charities. We want to give them the tools to thrive.\nIf the Liberal Democrats ran the Council, we would:\nOppose moves towards selective education and continue fighting for a good comprehensive education for all children.\nSupport schools so they have enough places, and work towards having great Special Educational Needs and Disability support in all schools. The Council does not run all schools in Milton Keynes, but we will fight for the best education for all children.\nSupport the development of a new university for Milton Keynes, so that we become a city of choice for students.\nImprove access for young people to mental health services by supporting initiatives such as the YiS Youth Counselling Service. We secured £45,000 in the 2020/21 budget to fund additional children's mental health support in the form of targeted young people's drug and alcohol work.\nPress for more support for young people leaving care who need help finding housing. The Liberal Democrats brought a motion on this in January 2021, to make sure the Council investigates the current process. We also secured £70,000 in the Council's 2021/22 budget to help children leaving care with rent deposits and getting on the housing ladder.\nWork to increase the number of foster parents within Milton Keynes.\nSupport our libraries and children and family centres, which provide valuable help and advice to families throughout the borough.\nHelp our young carers by working with the specialist service Young Carers MK, to make sure they're getting the help and advice they need.\nFight for better health and social care, so that our residents have the support they need.\nHealth and social care services across the country were already struggling due to central government funding cuts, and then the pandemic hit them hard. We need to make sure lessons are learnt from COVID-19, especially when it comes to care.\nOur residents deserve the best health and social care, so if the Liberal Democrats ran the Council, we would:\nReflect thelessons learnt from the pandemic in Council policy, particularly how care home residents and staff can be protected from infection whilst still allowing vital contact with family and friends.\nWork with partners to reduce health inequalities. The Liberal Democrats understand that COVID hit BAME communities particularly hard, and brought a motion pushing the Cabinet to investigate the need for extra support for those communities.\nMaintain the collaborative way of working between the Council, partners, volunteers and families that was established during the pandemic.\nCampaign for equal support and treatment between physical and mental health for young and old residents alike. This is particularly crucial given the impact of the pandemic and lockdowns on mental health.\nSupport independent and sheltered living for our elderly residents, ensuring they always have quality support.\nEnsure Council and NHS services can handle the growing demand for adult social care as our population ages.\nContinue to fight for better support and care for people with dementia, as the number of early-onset dementia cases rise.\nSupport the expansion of Milton Keynes University Hospital, so that healthcare provision grows along with our city.\nLook after our neighbourhoods, so they are tidy, safe and places that residents of MK can be proud of.\nSince the last elections, the Liberal Democrats have been fighting for safe communities, where the streets are looked after, and the environment is kept tidy. With people spending more time in their local area due to the pandemic, this is more important than ever.\nIf the Liberal Democrats ran the Council, we would:\nImprove our street scene by fixing potholes, clearing litter and removing weeds.\nWork to ensure Council-owned play areas are kept tidy, clean and safe.\nSupport the Council's new understanding of regeneration as a process of full estate renewal including issues of health, education, jobs, housing, and visual pride in where one lives.\nWork to resurface our roads where needed, making our roads safer.\nReduce flooding of our homes, streets and roads by fighting for better maintenance of our waterways and the provision of balancing lakes in new areas where required. Our drains and sewers need to be cleaned out regularly so they can handle the excessive rainfall caused by climate change. We will make sure to involve community groups who deal with these issues first-hand and provide them with any advice or equipment they may want to help their community.\nContinue discussions with the Parks Trust to secure our city's long-term commitment to increased biodiversity.\nListen to residents after the wheeled bin pilot, which is testing the use of wheeled bins instead of refuse and recycling sacks. The Liberal Democrats called for this pilot to see if it could result in cleaner streets and increased recycling.\nWork closely with partners, particularly the Police and local schools, to help reduce crime, gang activity and anti-social behaviour. We will continue to support the SaferMK Partnership and the MK Knife Crime and Youth Violence Task Force to make sure our borough is a safe place.\nImprove and innovate our public transport, so public transport becomes a real choice for residents.\nThe Liberal Democrats not only want to improve existing transport in Milton Keynes but create new and innovative modes of transport for our residents to use.\nIf we truly want our city to be carbon neutral by 2030, we need accessible and progressive public transport options for our residents.\nIf the Liberal Democrats ran the Council, we would:\nProtect and repair our unique network of redways, so our residents can safely cycle and walk around Milton Keynes. Our redways were a lifeline for many residents during lockdown - the Liberal Democrats will defend them.\nWork to ensure innovations in public transport serve the needs of our residents. Some bus routes in Milton Keynes are being replaced with a more flexible and cost-effective Demand Responsive Transport system, and the Liberal Democrats will fight for this system to be as efficient and accessible as possible.\nUpgrade more of our bus stops to have proper shelter and lights.\nPush for more electric vehicles to be used in public transport schemes. We'll also increase the number of electric car charging points throughout Milton Keynes, so that more people are encouraged to use electric cars.\nSupport the development of a mass transit transport scheme across Milton Keynes, so that more residents have fast and reliable public transport available to them.\nSupport the building ofEast West Rail between Oxford and Cambridge and campaign for Milton Keynes to benefit from the infrastructure that comes with it. We will fight for smaller stations to be kept open, and for the line to have electric trains.\nCampaign for a Milton Keynes Transport Authority, like Transport for London, so that we can have control over the public transport in our borough.\nRebuild the local economy and keep a balanced council budget, so that we have a stable recovery from COVID-19.\nOur future depends on our local economy recovering from the impact of COVID-19 and Brexit. We must put in place the infrastructure and support for businesses to thrive again. By doing this, we will attract businesses, investment and jobs.\nIf the Liberal Democrats ran the Council, we would:\nHelp in the economic recovery from COVID-19 by supporting training in industries of the future, such as STEM and the green economy, and encouraging lifelong learning.\nProvide residents with advice when it comes to any necessary career changes and retraining following redundancies that occur as a result of the pandemic or Brexit.\nSupport and develop the existing Economic Recovery Plan for Milton Keynes.\nEncourage the growth of small businesses, potential relocation of head offices to our city, and long-term,inward investment by providing advice and support. We will lobby the government to provide financial support for our high streets.\nWork with partners to ensure that local organisations and businesses are getting the support they need now the Brexit transition period is over.\nEnsure the work of scrutiny within the Council is upheld with appropriate financial backing, making sure to continue the transparency of Council finances.\nWork to balancethe budget for another year and maintain Council reserves at appropriate levels, in the face of the pandemic and uncertain future central government funding. We know that reserves should be used on a rainy day, and we will endeavour to replace reserves that had to be used during the pandemic.\nFight for fair funding for Councils through the Local Government Association.\nSupport plans such asthe Oxford to Cambridge Development Arc, the new Milton Keynes University, Plan:MK and the Strategy for 2050, ensuring Milton Keynes and its residents benefit from industry, infrastructure and transport.\nCreate a carbon neutral Milton Keynes by 2030, so that we become a truly green city.\nThe Liberal Democrats care about our city and the planet, and want to make Milton Keynes the greenest city in the UK. To do this, we need to make our city carbon neutral by 2030 and carbon negative by 2050. We will build on our strengths to develop our Green City reputation, and will set an example for other cities across the UK to follow.\nIf the Liberal Democrats ran the Council, we would:\nPursue large scale tree-planting in the borough and ensure that trees are planted in all new estates to support our aim for Milton Keynes to be a city that is 40% green and blue open space.\nProtect wildlife by creating continuous wildlife corridors across the city, protecting the habitats of our endangered species and making sure wildlife is not reduced due to poor planning and unsuitable landscaping.\nEnsure that if there are changes to our waste collection or recycling systems in the future, our resident's voices will be heard, and any changes will be to assist residents to help increase recycling. We will investigate new and innovative ways of recycling, so that our Council continues to develop its Green City reputation.\nLead on green energy. We remain committed to switching the Council centrally to using recognised green electricity at the next opportunity and will encourage individually managed properties and centres to do the same.\nReview the Council's zero carbon policies for the next Local Plan to minimise the carbon from new buildings, and maximise carbon reductions elsewhere.\nReduce the energy used by our existing homes by offering schemes to help homeowners, and by installing energy efficiency measures in Council homes.\nDeliver the Council's Sustainability Strategy Action Plan, including the development of an Energy Hub, so that we can become a truly green city.",

This includes 529 cancer patients in Milton Keynes.\nThis means only 32% of patients in the area were treated within two months, below the government target of 85%.\nLaunching the Liberal Democrat election manifesto this week, Liberal Democrat Leader Ed Davey has set out proposals to invest an extra £8.4 billion a year in the NHS and social care.\nThe Liberal Democrat plan to boost cancer survival rates includes increasing the number of radiotherapy machines across the country, cutting the time for groundbreaking new medicines to reach patients, a new cancer research law, and improved support for cancer patients and their families.\nThe policy builds on existing proposals from the party on health, including introducing a right to see a GP within a week and expanding NHS dentistry so people aren’t forced to pay for private dental treatment.\nLiberal Democrat spokesperson for Milton Keynes Central, James Cox said:\n“Everyone knows someone whose life has been turned upside down by cancer.\n“Far too many people are waiting far too long for a diagnosis, or to start treatment after being diagnosed. We must do right by them and get them the care they need when they need it.\n“The Liberal Democrats would give cancer patients a new, legal right to treatment within two months of an urgent referral, to make sure they get the timely care they deserve.

We then pledged to end rough-sleeping, and we have. However, issues surrounding homelessness and rough sleeping are often complex and the Council is aware of around 4 or 5 individuals who currently don't wish to engage with the homelessness service right now. We are doing regular welfare checks to ensure they are okay, and we will not give up on anyone.\"\nThe Council also provides support for those at risk of homelessness, including advice and help with private renting.\nCouncillor Robin Bradburn, Lib Dem Deputy Leader of the Council, added:\n\"Rough sleepers are homeless, but not all homeless people are rough sleepers. In Milton Keynes we have seen a frightening correlation between the number of no-fault evictions, or Section 21 notices, and the number of families presenting themselves as homeless to our temporary accommodation team.\n\"The Government's continuous lack of effort to ban these cruel evictions has seen far too many families lose their homes. We welcome the news that these inhumane Section 21s will finally be abolished but it should have come sooner. There are far too many families who have suffered as a result.\"",

  "https_www_mklibdems_co_uk_/https_www_mklibdems_co_uk_news_article_the-environment-in-everything-we-do/content_570.html": "The Environment in Everything we Do\nDefending the environment is central to everything we do. Policies we've influenced in Milton Keynes always have care about the environment at their heart, and MK is a greener city for the things our party has done. What we've not done is talked about our achievements, because we\nassume everyone else would behave in the same way.\nI'm writing this as a relative newcomer to the Milton Keynes Liberal Democrats, having become involved in the party a few years ago. Those in our party talk about the environment and take action all the time, even if we don't shout about it. Recently when I started asking our councillors about our green policies and what our party has achieved they gave a long list of successes to be proud of over the years, both in and out of power in the council. The list would be too long to give here, however it is clear that they have promoted green policy at every level at every opportunity in Milton Keynes without realising how much they have done, because defending the environment for future generations seems as normal to them as breathing.\nRecycling is a Start\nWhen measuring achievements on the environment recycling is one of the 'easiest' things councils talk about, and the Liberal Democrats have\na good record, including harder choices for long term good.\nBefore 2002 Milton Keynes had been run by other parties for many years, green policy had been neglected and recycling rates in the borough were lingering at 11%. In the elections in 2002 when Liberal Democrats took majority control on Milton Keynes that changed, and in the following 9 years that our councillors ran MK recycling rates were increased to 55%. The changes were by making recycling systems better, increasing the range of items that could be recycled, and engaging residents so that systems were easy to use and more people did recycle.\nOne of those changes was the introduction of green bins in MK. Initially for garden waste and charged for, with the Lib Dems later making them free allowing kitchen waste and introduced kitchen caddies, reducing the food waste which went to landfill by making it easier for residents to do the right thing.\nThe Liberal Democrat successes have not been continued by the Tory and Labour councillors which have run MK council since 2011, and recycling rates have not improved much since then 2011. While Lib Dems included a defence of the environment in all policy areas automatically the other parties have been letting Milton Keynes down.\nA choice many councils made which is now causing them problems was deciding to recycle 'on the cheap', sending their recycling across the world to China and elsewhere because the cost was lower. This often involved low standards and in the last few years we've been finding out that much of this 'recycling' wasn't reprocessed but was just buried or dumped.\nMilton Keynes doesn't have that problem because over a decade ago our Lib Dem councillors ensured that recycling from Milton Keynes was sent for processing in the UK, ensuring it was properly tracked and disposed of. This decision which seemed more expensive in the short term is now confirmed as the right thing to do.\nNow the percentage of waste recycled rather than sent to landfill in Milton Keynes is set to increase again, and it is due to the Waste Recovery\nPark planned under the last Liberal Democrat administration in MK. The plant in Wolverton will take black sack waste and separate out materials which can be reused or recycled, some that will need to be buried, and some which will be heat treated. However unlike many similar plants elsewhere the heat treatment will be fully contained: no waste will be put out into the environment.\nRecently when the Labour led council considered introducing charges for green bins our councillors produced evidence to show that the plan to charge wouldn't work. While the Tories used it as an opportunity to attack others, Lib Dem councillors provided Labour with evidence to show it is better to keep green bins free without turning the issue into a political football.\nGreener Homes\nAny building built in Milton Keynes in the last 10 years has lower utility bills because of changes made when Liberal Democrats were running the council, and now future houses will have even higher standards thanks to the influence our councillors have in the council.\nWhen Liberal Democrats took over the council back in 2002 our councillors felt the standards for new housing left in place by previous parties were not good enough, so under a policy known as \"D4\" changed the rules to ensure developers needed to meet higher levels of water and energy efficiency for any new buildings, and those moving into recently built houses benefit along with the environment.\nOur councillors continue to demand better, and with improving systems and need to reduce the impact on Milton Keynes on the global environment have introduced even higher standards. The local plan called Plan:MK which outlines the growth of Milton Keynes until the early 2030s has had active support from Liberal Democrat councillors who have insisted on making it the best plan which can be achieved, including delivering higher standards for our next generation of housing in MK.\nWhile our current generation of buildings have higher standards thanks to Lib Dem councillors in MK, the next advance in standards will again be down to pressure from our council group. We need to improve our current housing too, which is why one of our manifesto commitments is to invest in existing council housing in MK to bring them up to the 'A energy efficiency rating' required for new homes, which will both reduce bills for those in social housing in MK while defending the environment.\nWhile the council can directly invest in council homes we want it to support change in privately owned homes, working with private landlords and home owners including giving information about grants available to bring their properties up to a good standard.\nEmpowering People with Better Transport\nPublic transport should provide people with a good service, a real choice about how they travel, and as far as possible be a real alternative to the car. For all of the good things about Milton Keynes the transport system is something which hasn't worked well, with so many people reliant on the car.\nGiving people a real choice is why when the Liberal Democrats ran the council between 2002 and 2011 investment in buses was increased, and bus use was going up, with many people choosing to take the bus over having a car. Since 2011 the other parties have not kept up the same push for good bus services in MK to meet people's needs. Many have given up on buses leading to a fall in use, with many people now forced to use the car even when their families struggle to afford it - choices have been taken away.\nWhile we are calling for more support for bus routes across MK we need a better solution in the long term. Liberal Democrats support the proposal to develop a 'bullet bus' network (tube-train style fast electric buses) with separated bus routes across MK, which allow for much faster buses. New stations for the network would provide hubs for more regular buses which would bring regular routes closer to people's homes. We need to give people choices.\nNew technology needs to play a part where possible. Liberal Democrats have supported the roll out of more charging points for electric cars, and are supportive of innovative new solutions which will increase people's choices while helping reduce our impact on the environment.\nBuses aren't the only sort of environmentally friendly transport of course. The Santander cycle scheme, brought in by the Lib Dems, has offered people cheap use of a bike for years. Now that's being extended by the new Lime Bikes (electric bikes) - powered, like MK's streetlights, schools and council buildings, by green electricity, again brought in under the Lib Dems.\nDefending the Environment by Design\nAlthough a long article, what I've covered here are just a few of the points I've picked up from Liberal Democrat councillors. While some others shout about defending the environment to get attention and don't deliver when they have the chance, and some have high ideals and talk about these issues while never having the opportunity to deliver, our Liberal Democrat councillors have continued to work for the environment in Milton Keynes year after year.\nOur Lib Dem councillors don't jump on bandwagons, even though some others do, they just do the hard graft, treating the defence of the environment as part of the day job, just something to deliver to help leave the world a better place than they found it.\nI am proud of the achievements our councillors have made and the goals continue to fight for on the environment. It frustrates me that they don't shout about it more, so I'll be doing my best to do it on their behalf.\nWhen Milton Keynes becomes the greenest city in the UK a large part of the achievement will be down to the Liberal Democrat councillors in this borough, and I'm proud of them.",

By joining a food larder, an individual could save up to £400 per year on their weekly shop while preventing perfectly good food from going to landfill.\nThis comes as food prices are at their highest level in 45 years, with food inflation hitting 18.3%.\nCouncillor Jane Carr, Cabinet Member for Tackling Social Inequalities, said:\n“We launched the Winter Plan to mitigate the devastating impact that the cost-of-living crisis is having on families across Milton Keynes. Through the Winter Plan we have funded warm spaces, helped households with energy bills, and provided grants for people in immediate hardship. I’m pleased that this fund has also gone towards purchasing thousands of food items for hard-working families, especially when people are struggling to afford to put dinner on the table.”\nThe food larders are run by charity SOFEA, with other local organisations including Age UK and Citizens Advice also visiting the larders to host helpful advice sessions.\nWoughton & Fishermead Ward Councillor Sue Smith, who is also Chair of Woughton Community Council, added:\n“Food larders play a crucial role in tackling food poverty, as they give people the chance to buy food at incredibly low prices. There are several food larders in my ward, and I’ve seen first-hand how great they are at giving people access to low-cost food and other support services, while also tackling social isolation.”\nMore information and the locations of the food larders can be found at: https://www.sofea.uk.com/\n<hr/>\nThe City Council’s £3.3m Winter Plan was launched in November 2022 to help residents with the soaring cost of living: https://www.milton-keynes.gov.uk/sites/default/files/2022-11/Winter%20Plan.pdf",

But now with the city expanding, local councils could have greater control over the services that matter the most to their residents.\nThe City Council already has a Community Asset Transfer programme in place which saw 15 leisure and community buildings transferred to town and parish councils last year, allowing full control over the future management and investment into these spaces based on their area’s needs.\nCouncillor Sam Crooks, who proposed the amendment, said:\n“As Milton Keynes continues to grow, we need to ensure services are managed in the most effective way. Luckily, our city is home to dozens of parish and town councils who are already at the heart of their communities and well-placed to take on more responsibilities. This will not only put more power into the hands of local people, but it will also help the City Council to free up resources for other services.”\nCouncillor Saleena Raja, who represents Shenley Brook End Ward and chairs Shenley Brook End and Tattenhoe Parish Council, added:\n“I welcome the news that the City Council has agreed to look into this, as I know from experience that parish councils are more than capable of taking on these responsibilities. Our parish council took over the ownership of the community centre, and since we have taken on landscaping, half of the playparks and almost all of the local facilities. I hope this is a step in the right direction to speed up the process and give us the tools and resources we need to continue to deliver services for our communities.”\nThe City Council will now consider how the transfer of assets and services can be implemented further ensuring that communities remain at the forefront of decision making.\nMilton Keynes City Council’s 25/26 budget that was debated last Wednesday saw Labour councillors accept two amendments put forward by the Liberal Democrat Group.",

The scheme was due to run from January until March 2023.\nIn February, the Government announced the cap would remain in place for a further 3 months and continue until the end of June.\nBefore the cap was in place the average cost of a single adult journey in Milton Keynes was £2.90, now at the reduced price of £2, this is saving residents almost a third of the ticket price.\nLiberal Democrat Councillor Paul Trendall who represents Campbell Park and Old Woughton will move the motion. He will ask the Chief Executive of the City Council to write to the Secretary of State for Transport and the Chancellor to request the £2 bus fare cap be extended until 31 December 2023.\nCouncillor Paul Trendall, said:\n\"Thousands of people rely on the bus services every day to get to work, school, and to attend medical appointments. As the cost-of-living crisis continues, many people are facing financial difficulties and this reduced fare is lifeline for many. The Government put this cap in place to help passengers with travel costs, increase passenger numbers, and to protect vital bus routes, but what makes them think these problems will be solved by the end of June?\"\nAlthough the buses in Milton Keynes are run by private companies, the City Council subsidises concessionary fares for the over 65s (which includes ENCTS passes), disabled residents, and the All in 1 Card for under 19s.\nTo help minimise the impact on residents during the cost-of-living crisis, the City Council has upped financial support for the All in 1 Card holders to cover inflationary fare increases across private bus companies. The City Council already pays 50p per trip, but they will provide an extra 20p to help reduce the cost for residents.\nLiberal Democrat Leader on Milton Keynes City Council, Councillor Robin Bradburn added:\n\"The City Council gets less money from Central Government year after year and by subsidising fares and providing extra money to support residents, we are already doing all that we can to help. We know private bus companies are struggling and we are continuing to support residents where we can, but we can't do it all.

To this end, we would work with voluntary organisations and groups who work with low-income families to find real, long-term solutions to the plight of our most vulnerable individuals and families.\nHomelessness\nMK Liberal Democrats believe that homelessness devastates lives. We will make tackling homelessness a priority with the aim of having no families in temporary accommodation or bed & breakfast. MK Liberal Democrats will do more to help the increasing number of single homeless people. We also commit to building homes and hostels on Council-owned land to help homeless people rebuild their lives, and to work with the voluntary sector to help put an end to homeless in Milton Keynes.\nAffordable Housing\nMK Liberal Democrats will support the strict enforcement of the current policy of 30% affordable housing, both to buy and for rental, with a proposal to increase that percentage to 35%, in line with the latest projections of need.\nRegeneration\nMilton Keynes Liberal Democrats support regeneration of our older estates. The Liberal Democrats believe that, when fully supported by local communities, regeneration will lead to high quality homes, greater job opportunities, better health facilities and improved educational prospects. The Liberal Democrats will NOT support any 'top-down' imposition of regeneration - in order to be successful, all regeneration schemes must be backed by residents, following full and robust consultation.\nGrowth\nWe support growth and will aim to build at least 1,750 houses per year including at least 30% affordable, but growth must come with the required physical and social infrastructure and protect our green open spaces.\nEducation\nLiberal Democrats remain committed to non-selective education. We believe in a good school for EVERYONE.\nWe would continue to ensure the provision of the required level of school places and an environment that supports learning.\nThe Economy\nThe Lib Dem would support the economy by supporting inward investment, and especially helping our young people into work for the first time, e.g. through apprenticeship schemes and encouraging employers to help schools and colleges prepare young people for work.\nWorking with others/Devolution\nAs Milton Keynes Council has to shrink with Government imposed cuts, we would work with the Voluntary Sector and parishes to see if they could take over some functions that may otherwise be cut.\nRecycling\nWhen the Liberal Democrats last ran the Council we increased recycling rates FIVE fold from 11% to 55%. Rates have now flattened. We need to continue to maintain Milton Keynes at the innovative edge of recycling and aim to continually increase MK's recycling rates. The Liberal Democrats would produce a new Waste Strategy.\nThe Environment\nThe Environment is very important to the Liberal Democrats.\nResidents are getting concerned that the physical environment is looking neglected and areas are starting to look run down. When the Liberal Democrats last ran the Council we tackled environmental neglect by such initiatives as introducing the Graffiti Busters and removing abandoned cars quickly. We would once again look at ways of tackling environmental neglect, such as making the cleansing service more flexible, enabling hot spots to receive an adequate service.\nThe Liberal Democrats would continue to improve our management of water and flooding to reduce water consumption and protect the borough from flooding. We would ensure the new Flood & Water Strategy is implemented.\nPotholes\nThe Liberal Democrats are not satisfied that the Council's current policy on fixing potholes is fit for purpose. They only fix potholes over 50mm deep, but will leave those around them unfilled. The Council seems to spend more time measuring potholes than fixing them.\nThe Liberal Democrats would instigate a review of the Council's pothole policy to take into account the number of potholes as well as the depth.\nWe also believe that pavements and redways need to receive equal attention to avoid accidents and prevent elderly people falling.\nPublic Transport\nPublic Transport is important to the Liberal Democrats as it is often used by those without access to a car, the elderly, the young and the low paid.\nIt is the means by which many get to and from work, so early morning and evening services are important, remembering that the Shopping Centre is open 7 days a week, Sunday services are important too.\nHealth/Adult Social Care\nLiberal Democrats would continue to support independent living for our senior citizens. We would explore offering the warden service to residents in need of it living in the community.\nLiberal Democrats believe that mental illness should get the same priority as physical illness.\nWe need to deliver more services for the growing number of residents suffering from dementia.\nWe would campaign for a local GP for everyone.\nChildren's Social Care\nThe Liberal Democrats would continue to ensure the protection from harm of all children in MK, and ensure that children in MK Council's care receive the best possible support to flourish physically, mentally and spiritually.\nWe need to improve the access of children to mental health services.\nFinance and Resources\nWe would review the spend on the Council refurbishment programme to identify and seek money to put into capital projects such as school builds and city infrastructure.\nWe propose the sale of excess land and buildings in order to generate capital receipts to benefit the capital programme.\nWe would carry out a fundamental review of the budget with a view to minimising or ceasing unnecessary activities.\nWe would ensure that when staff levels are reduced that senior and middle management levels are also reduced.\nWe will impose strict time limits on interim positions before they must be made permanent, and end the practice of allowing staff to be self-employed and contracted via a personal company to the Council.\nWe would change procurement rules to tighten up on tax avoidance.",

This, partnered with inflation sitting at its highest in forty years, rising food costs and staggering fuel prices, could plunge even more families into poverty.\nCurrently, over 17,000 households in the city are 'seriously struggling' with their finances even before they're faced with a colossal energy hike. Considering the current wholesale gas prices, increasing energy bills show no sign of subsiding.\nLabour and Liberal Democrat councillors have criticised the Government's mere offer of financial help for energy bills, which is just a fraction of the costs that families will face.\nCouncillor Jane Carr, Liberal Democrat Progressive Alliance Cabinet Member for Tackling Social Inequalities, said:\n\"Thousands of local families are already struggling to make ends meet, and it's frightening to think that energy bills could soar even further. As the weather grows colder, the cost-of-living crisis will only worsen. The Government are failing the people of Milton Keynes - a few hundred pounds off energy bills does nothing, especially when you're facing an increase in the thousands. That's why the Progressive Alliance has stepped up to provide half a million pounds to help people through the energy crisis, and we are spending millions of pounds in direct financial support. But sadly we can't do it all, the Government aren't doing enough and they need to do better.\"\nThe Labour/Liberal Democrat Progressive Alliance has put aside over £18 million pounds in their 2022/23 budget to help struggling residents as bills skyrocket, including:\n- Over £15 million to help residents on low incomes pay their Council Tax bill\n- Over £3 million for concessionary public transport fares\n- Half a million pounds to help people struggling with the energy crisis\n- £150,000 to maintain a Local Welfare Provision Scheme, which can help residents in need by providing items such as beds, cookers, and fridge freezers",

The fact that nine out of ten children have been offered a place at their first-choice school is great news, and I look forward to seeing this figure improve in the years to come.\"\nCommenting on the figures, Councillor Zoe Nolan, Labour Progressive Alliance Cabinet Member for Children and Families, said:\n\"The Progressive Alliance welcomes the news that so many children have been offered a place at their first-choice school.

It will offer an increased level of financial assistance for those on the lowest incomes, information about potential grants and/or funding towards energy efficiency measures.\nIn addition, the Council will implement a new online voucher portal that will help the local authority and the voluntary sector in issuing support with the cost of food, fuel and essential living items. The Council will also issue bulk fuel awards to pensioners on low incomes prior to the winter period.\nOther features of the support package include:\n- Home energy performance reviews; the Council will work with partners to advise communities what work could be undertaken to improve energy efficiency of their property, and potentially allow groups of homeowners to collectively apply for grants (e.g. whole streets)\n- Energy crisis community drop-in sessions across the city which involve multiple agencies to help people with cost-of-living pressures\nCouncillor Rob Middleton, Labour Progressive Alliance Cabinet Member for Resources, is set to agree the package at a Delegated Decision tomorrow (6/9):\n\"The cost-of-living crisis is already devastating families' lives, and it is only expected to get worse. Families shouldn't have to choose between heating their homes, putting dinner on the table, or getting themselves into debt but unfortunately that will be the harsh reality for thousands of people across the city. The Progressive Alliance has committed to mitigate the impact of the cost-of-living crisis as much as possible by providing over £18m in direct financial support this year, and we hope that this support package will provide practical help and guidance to those that need it.\"\nCouncillor Jane Carr, Lib Dem Progressive Alliance Cabinet Member for the cost-of-living crisis, added:\n\"It is heart-breaking that the soaring cost of living is plunging countless families into poverty. The Government has even said that middle-earners on £45,000 will struggle to pay the bills. What hope does this leave for pensioners and other low-income families? While the Government has been failing to act, the Council has stepped up to provide a network of support. Families shouldn't have to plunge into poverty due to the failings of this Government.\"\nLast week, the Progressive Alliance announced that Milton Keynes City Council-owned buildings (including libraries) would be made into emergency warm spaces during the winter. The Council will also work with partners to make more buildings, such as community centres and churches, available so that people have a warm space within close distance to their home.",

We had candidates in every part of Milton Keynes and the towns/villages within the borough, so people could vote for our party wherever they are.\nPlease back our campaign for proportional representation! While people living in the areas above will have known we were campaigning hard, the current First Past the Post electoral system punishes parties which campaign everywhere, by forcing them to target a smaller number of winnable seats.

We support proportional representation for elections so that the number of seats earned much more closely matches the number of people who voted for that party.

This includes data gathered via third parties, such as social media sites, and which is therefore also covered by their own Privacy Polices.\nThis policy was last updated on 2nd May 2018. Any updates will be posted to this version of the policy. If you wish to see a previous version of the policy, or have any other questions, please get in touch.\nWe may collect personal data about you such as:\nWe may also collect information when you interact with the party digitally, such as by visiting one of our websites or communicating with one of our social media channels.

For more information on service providers, please see here: https://www.libdems.org.uk/data-sharing.\nIn addition, we may share your personal data with third parties when we are required to do so by law (for example, with the Police where they ask us to assist them with their investigations).\nHowever, save for the limited circumstances noted above, we will never pass your personal data to any unrelated third parties unless you have given us your permission to do so. For example, where you have signed a petition and are clearly informed that this petition will be presented to a third party.\nThe Party is a registered national political party in the UK; our work is designed to promote our values and to engage UK citizens in the democratic process.\nAccordingly, our work is considered to be of substantial public interest. Because of that public interest basis we are entitled to process sensitive personal data which relates to your political opinions, and your personal data more generally, for the purposes of enabling us to perform our work effectively. Specifically, that processing may include using those aspects of your personal data to help us to plan and execute political campaigns, canvass for your support (such as by visiting or calling you), raise funds, and perform casework that relates to you and your local community.\nYou do have rights to ask us to stop processing your data for these purposes, and you can read details about those rights here . In addition to the above we may also process your data for other purposes where you ask us to, or enter into a relationship with us that requires us to.\nFor example, if you choose to join us as a volunteer we will need to process your personal data to record that you have given us your support in this way. A contract will be put in place between you and us and we will process your personal data to the extent that we need to in order to fulfil our obligations under that contract.\nSimilarly, you may from time to time give us your consent to send you communications by e-mail (or similar mediums) which promote our work. Where you do that we will use your details to send you those kinds of communications until you tell us otherwise. Should you ever ask us to stop sending those kinds of communications we will hold your details on file to ensure that we respect that request – we justify that retention on the basis that we have a legitimate interest in holding your data in that way.\nFinally, where we have received your personal data in the various ways described above, we may continue to hold it as part of our records after the relevant processing has stopped. We hold data in this way because we have a legitimate interest in doing so. Specifically, where you have been a member or a volunteer (or have otherwise engaged with us such as by attending a conference or event, or by responding to a survey or questionnaire) we have a legitimate interest in holding your personal data to help us to monitor the numbers and the diversity of people who engage with us, as well as a legitimate interest in making sure that we can follow up any complaints or grievances which you may raise (or which people may raise about you).\nThe Party will not sell your personal data to third parties.\nDepending on how and why you provide us with your personal data it may be shared within the Party (e.g. between local, regional and national parts of the party) and our elected representatives. It may also be shared with those who provide services to the Party (“service providers”).\nWe may use service providers to undertake processing operations on our behalf to provide us with a variety of administrative, statistical, advertising and technical services. We will only supply service providers with the minimum amount of personal data they need to fulfil the services we request. We oblige all of our data processors to sign contracts with us that clearly set out their commitment to respecting individual rights, protecting your personal data – including not using it for any purpose other than providing us with an agreed service or fulfilling their legal obligations - and their commitments to assisting us to help you exercise your rights as a data subject.\nWith your consent, service providers may hold personal data about you in order to facilitate the provision of future services or financial transactions to which you have agreed, such as a payment processor retaining your payment details in order to process agreed future payments from you.\nPlease note that some of our service providers are based outside of the European Economic Area (the “EEA”). Where we transfer your data to a service provider that is outside of the EEA we seek to ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place to make sure that your personal data is held securely and that your rights as a data subject are upheld – in almost all cases we do this by ensuring that the agreements between us and our chosen service providers contain what are called the ‘model clauses’ that oblige them to treat your personal data as if they themselves were based in the EEA.\nIn addition, we may share your personal data with third parties when we are required to do so by law (for example, with the Police where they ask us to assist them with their investigations). In some cases, this may result in your personal data becoming public.\nIn particular, the Party and our candidates are required to submit records, including personal data, of donations above certain thresholds to the relevant regulatory authority. In some cases, some of these donation details are made public.

This additional funding will help tackle the issue and prevent further delays.”\nCouncillor Peter Cannon, Shadow Cabinet Member for Finance, added:\n“With access to additional funding, the City Council can repair damaged signs more quickly, which prevents them from being beyond repair. This reduces the need for more costs later down the line when paying for full replacements.”\nThe City Council’s budget for 25/26 will be debated at Full Council tonight which will be live streamed on MKCC’s YouTube channel.",

The ward councillor for Broughton concluded: \"We Liberal Democrats believe democracy should be accessible, which is why we put on record our support for online council meetings last year.

This called on the Government to change legislation to allow proportional representation to be used for general and local elections.\nProportional representation is the idea that seats won are in proportion to the votes cast. The voting system which is used in over 80 countries is more representative, allows greater choice for voters and ensures few votes are wasted.\nIn comparison, first past the post - the system currently used is not always representative as the winning candidate doesn't need a majority of votes in their area to win their seat.\nLib Dem councillors heavily criticised the first past the post system, arguing the outdated system leaves many unrepresented and leaves voters with little choice on polling day.\nAll 17 Conservative councillors in attendance voted against the motion for a fairer voting system.\nLiberal Democrat Group Leader on Milton Keynes City Council, Councillor Robin Bradburn who moved the motion, said:\n\"The argument from the Conservatives that proportional representation causes useless coalitions and indecisive governments is totally unfounded.

The party is calling for both pensions and benefits to be uprated in line with inflation to protect vulnerable families and pensioners.\nLiberal Democrat Group Leader on Milton Keynes City Council, Councillor Robin Bradburn said:\n\"This Conservative government is flip flopping every week on pension cuts, leaving elderly residents in limbo and fearful for the future.\n\"Many local people I speak to are worried about the damage that a failure to uprate pensions could inflict. If the Conservatives abandon their manifesto promise it risks plunging vulnerable pensioners into poverty, here and across the country.\n\"The Conservative record of saying one thing and doing another is just not good enough. Pensioners should not have to pay the price for the Conservative government's' economic mess and mismanagement.\n\"Why is the Prime Minister not providing the reassurance that so many are crying out for? It seems he just doesn't care and is taking pensioners in places like Milton Keynes for granted.\n\"Liberal Democrats want to see both benefits and pensions uprated in line with inflation so that no one is left cold or hungry this winter. Pensioners and the most vulnerable in our society must not be abandoned by this government\"",

And around 140,000 pets have been given up for rehoming due to the cost of looking after them.\nThe Lib Dems are worried about the devastating impact rehoming family pets could have on owners mental and physical health.\nCouncillor Jane Carr, Cabinet Member for Tackling Social Inequalities proposed the motion asking the City Council to encourage local food organisations such as MK Food Bank and SOFEA to work with animal charities to help struggling pet owners to improve their mental health.\nCouncillor Jane Carr, said:\n“Hard working families across the city have taken a big hit. And for those families with animals, it’s heart-breaking that they’re forced to make the tough decision to give up their family pets. The City Council has spent millions of pounds to help residents with the cost-of-living crisis and to support people with physical and mental health, but we also want to encourage a partnership between local food charities and animal organisations to ensure any surplus or excess pet food can be made available for struggling owners.”\nLast year, the City Council gave £100,000 to local food charities and invested £110,000 in local mental health projects to help the city’s residents.\nAs well as struggling pet owners, animal shelters are also facing rising costs due to the cost-of-living crisis, and with more animals arriving on their doorstep, this is putting even more pressure on an already stretched service.\nCouncillor Jenni Ferrans who represents Monkston, and is a cat owner herself, said:\n“The cost-of-living crisis is wreaking havoc with people’s mental health, they’re anxious, stressed, and for many the financial strain on social activities has led to feelings of isolation. Family pets have been a lifeline for people during the pandemic and now throughout the cost-of-living crisis, not only do they boost mood and keep you active, but they, also bring comfort and reduce feelings of loneliness, and that’s why it’s important for local partners to work together to ensure pets are kept with their owners.”\nEarlier this year, the City Council set aside £150,000 to fund new community clubs in Fullers Slade and the Lakes Estate to boost health and well-being and to ease feelings of loneliness.\nWednesday’s Full Council meeting can be viewed on YouTube here.",

  "https_www_mklibdems_co_uk_/https_www_mklibdems_co_uk_preamble/content_12.html": "Preamble to the Liberal Democrat Constitution\nThe beliefs of the Liberal Democrats\nThe Liberal Democrats exist to build and safeguard a fair, free and open society, in which we seek to balance the fundamental values of liberty, equality and community, and in which no-one shall be enslaved by poverty, ignorance or conformity. We believe that each generation is responsible for the fate of our planet and, by safeguarding the balance of nature and the environment, for the long term continuity of life in all its forms. We champion the freedom, dignity and well-being of individuals, we acknowledge and respect their right to freedom of conscience and their right to develop their talents to the full. We aim to disperse power, to foster diversity and to nurture creativity. We believe that the role of the state is to enable all citizens to attain these ideals, to contribute fully to their communities and to take part in the decisions which affect their lives.\nWe look forward to a world in which all people share the same basic rights, in which they live together in peace and in which their different cultures will be able to develop freely. Upholding these values of individual and social justice, we reject all prejudice and discrimination based upon race, ethnicity, caste, heritage, class, religion or belief, age, disability, sex, gender identity or sexual orientation and oppose all forms of entrenched privilege and inequality. Recognising that the quest for freedom and justice can never end, we promote human rights and open government, a sustainable economy which serves genuine need, public services of the highest quality, international action based on a recognition of the interdependence of all the world’s peoples and responsible stewardship of the earth and its resources. We believe that people should be involved in running their communities. We are determined to strengthen the democratic process and ensure that there is a just and representative system of government with effective Parliamentary institutions, freedom of information, decisions taken at the lowest practicable level and a fair voting system for all elections. We will at all times defend the right to speak, write, worship, associate and vote freely, and we will protect the right of citizens to enjoy privacy in their own lives and homes. We believe that sovereignty rests with the people and that authority in a democracy derives from the people. We therefore acknowledge their right to determine the form of government best suited to their needs and commit ourselves to the promotion of a democratic federal framework within which as much power as feasible is exercised by the nations and regions of the United Kingdom. We similarly commit ourselves to the promotion of a flourishing system of democratic local government in which decisions are taken and services delivered at the most local level which is viable.\nWe will foster a strong and sustainable economy which enables people to thrive in their communities, assessing progress by measuring people’s wellbeing. Such an economy will encourage necessary wealth creating processes, develop and use the skills of the people and work to the benefit of all, with a just distribution of the rewards of success. We want to see democracy, participation and the co-operative principle in industry and commerce within a competitive environment in which the state allows the market to operate freely where possible but intervenes where necessary. We will promote scientific research and innovation and will harness technological change to human advantage.\nWe will work for a sense of partnership and community in all areas of life. We recognise that the independence of individuals is safeguarded by their personal ownership of property, but that the market alone does not distribute wealth or income fairly. We support the widest possible distribution of wealth and promote the rights of all citizens to social provision and cultural activity. We seek to make public services responsive to the people they serve, to encourage variety and innovation within them and to make them available on equal terms to all.\nOur responsibility for justice and liberty cannot be confined by national boundaries; we are committed to fight poverty, oppression, hunger, ignorance, disease and aggression wherever they occur and to promote the free movement of ideas, people, goods and services. Setting aside national sovereignty when necessary, we will work with other countries towards an equitable and peaceful international order and a durable system of common security. Within the European Community we affirm the values of federalism and integration and work for unity based on these principles. We will contribute to the process of peace and disarmament, the elimination of world poverty and the collective safeguarding of democracy by playing a full and constructive role in international organisations which share similar aims and objectives. These are the conditions of liberty and social justice which it is the responsibility of each citizen and the duty of the state to protect and enlarge. The Liberal Democrats consist of people working together for the achievement of these aims.\nYou can find the full party constitution by clicking here.",

However, due to the coronavirus crisis the elections were postponed by a year until 2021, so the manifesto was never used as part of a campaign.\nThe manifesto has still been used. The results of the local elections in 2019 meant that Labour was the largest party with 23 seats, the Conservatives fell to 19 seats, and Liberal Democrats increased to 15 seats. This led to a renewal of the partnership agreement between Lib Dems and Labour on the council, with one part of the agreement being that the Lib Dem manifesto was added to the council plan. That partnership agreement with Labour running the council with Liberal Democrat support was planned to continue one for year, as elections were expected in 2020.\nWith the elections planned for 2020 pushed back by a year, the Lib Dem-Labour partnership agreement was due to come to an end in May. However it was decided to continue the partnership agreement, which is helping keep the council stable during the ongoing crisis.\nAs part of the agreement Labour has agreed to include the 2020 Liberal Democrat manifesto in the council plan for the next year.\nThank you to all councillors and members who helped contribute to the manifesto this year.",

Pupils from low and middle-income households are already being hit hard with the cost-of-living crisis this winter.\n\"With less teaching staff to turn to for support it will be the most disadvantaged who will suffer. I am urging the Conservative Government to act now and increase education spending to stop more children from falling through the gaps.\"\nThe challenges facing schools are ever-growing; after teacher salaries, pensions, and tax, they are hit with energy and rising food costs which puts even more pressure on their budgets.",

It was certainly a difficult budget, as councils across the country are facing soaring social care, energy, and inflation costs.\nHowever, the below-inflation council tax rise, combined with our investment in the needs and priorities of our residents, means that this budget delivers for the people of Milton Keynes.\"",

While people living in the areas above will have known we were campaigning hard, the current First Past the Post electoral system punishes parties which campaign everywhere, by forcing them to target a smaller number of winnable seats. As a result in many elections there are a number of 'safe seats' which unfortuantly get ignored much of the time. We support proportional representation for elections so that the number of seats earned much more closely matches the number of people who voted for that party.

There are people in Milton Keynes who have to choose between heating, eating and debt - so I know that free childcare, a fun activity and healthy meal will be a massive help to so many. I'd encourage families who haven't taken advantage of the programme yet to book as soon as possible. It's set to be a summer of fun.\"\nThe Summer of Play can be accessed by toddlers to teens, and there are dozens of locations across the city hosting free sessions.

Local leaseholders believe the government scheme is unlikely to cover any of the safety work that will be needed in Milton Keynes.\nEarlier this month, Milton Keynes Council pledged its support to residents battling this scandal. A motion, calling for leaseholders to be protected from these unfair costs, was passed with cross-party support.\nBen Nolan, Labour Councillor for Central Milton Keynes, moved the motion:\n\"There are thousands of innocent leaseholders living in Milton Keynes that are facing frightening bills for remediation work that is not their fault.\"\n\"The Government announced the £5bn fund in February so last week's announcement is nothing new. They need to stop misleading the public and take accountability for this crisis. It has been four and half years since the Grenfell Tragedy and it is despicable that people are still suffering at the hands of this Conservative Government.\"\nLib Dem Councillor Jenni Ferrans (Monkson Ward) seconded the motion:\n\"At Full Council we heard harrowing stories from local leaseholders who are trapped in their properties, which have been valued at zero pounds, all because of the failings of this Government.\"\n\"Where are our MPs in all of this? How can they sit by while blameless residents are evicted and even declare bankruptcy, for living in a home that is meant to be safe?\"\nThe Progressive Alliance is calling on residents to sign a petition, asking the Government to hold a full and independent enquiry into the cladding and fire safety scandal.\nThe petition will get a response from the Government as it has passed 10,000 signatures and may be considered for debate in Parliament once it passes 100,000.\nResidents can sign the petition here: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/587185",

In Milton Keynes there are currently (as at 10th October) 534 households, not individuals, who are homeless in Milton Keynes. That is roughly double the figure from just a year ago. These are in various types of temporary accommodation. Then on top of that is the increasing number of street homeless.\nThe main problem is quite simply a shortage of affordable and social housing for rent, which is not surprising as Council houses have been sold off for over three decades. There is a concern that the government's plans to also force Housing Associations to sell their houses off too will just increase homelessness. Where exactly does the government expect people on low incomes to live - other than on the streets of course?\nMost people don't realise that councils only have a duty to help house 'vulnerable' people with a local connection, which is basically people with children or the disabled. So, single people and childless couples are 'non-statutory' homeless and find themselves literally on the streets.\nThe Liberal Democrats have made tackling homelessness and the shortage of affordable housing one of its top priorities, and those priorities are now part of the Council Plan. We are pleased that Milton Keynes Council is leading the way and has agreed it has a moral duty, even if not a legal one, to do what it can to help the so called non-statutory homeless.\nWe are very lucky in Milton Keynes to have many charities that help the homeless, such as the YMCA, Open Door, the Winter Night Shelter, Orbit, and others. You may have read in the press that the Winter Night Shelter will be operating their Reception Centre from the Buzzy this coming winter.

This information has been sent on behalf of Thames Valley Police | | http://www.thamesvalley.police.uk/ | | | Message sent by | | Victoria Taylor (Police, Communications Officer, Thames Valley) | Thames Valley Police is today launching an awareness campaign encouraging people to protect their personal information. The 'Not With My Name' campaign, produced in partnership with the City of London Police (National Policing Lead for Fraud), is targeting identity crime in our communities. According to crime prevention service Cifas there were 1,482 cases of identity fraud reported in Buckinghamshire, 945 reported in Oxfordshire and 2,141 reported in Berkshire in 2014. Identity fraud can lead to inconvenience and distress with victims spending on average of 200 hours of their personal or businesses time to resolve. Victims often find money has been removed from their bank or their account has been taken over, a fraudulent passport or driving licence has been created in their name, or loans, mortgages and mobile phone contracts have been set-up using their identity. The proceeds of identity crime are often used to fund further criminal activity. To combat this rising threat the 'Not With My Name' campaign will highlight advice to help people protect their personal information. This will include pointers on creating safe passwords, protecting internet devices, dealing with unsolicited phone calls and emails, and safely storing and disposing of mail. These messages will be shared across Thames Valley Police Facebook and Twitter accounts. Detective Inspector Gavin Tyrrell of Thames Valley Police's Economic Crime Unit said: \"Identity crime, the creation of a false identity or the misuse of a genuine identity, affects people as they are going about their day to day lives. \"Normal things like online shopping can become a risk and identity crime deters vulnerable people and communities from taking part. \"The proceeds of identity crime can be used to fund serious and organised crime. \"That's why it's so vital members of the public can take simple steps to protect their personal information and safeguard against identity fraud. \"Simple things like changing your social media settings or creating safe passwords all make a difference. \"By working together and sharing these identity crime prevention tips we can reduce opportunities for identity fraud across the Thames Valley.\" The campaign is being supported nationally by police forces and organisations including Action Fraud, Get Safe Online, Cifas, FFA UK, Age UK and Experian. City of London Police Commander Steve Head, who is the Police National Coordinator for Economic Crime, said: \"To really get to grips with identity crime requires us all to come together and share advice on how to protect our personal information at home, in the workplace and while out in public places. Following the top tips provided by the 'Not With My Name' campaign will help people better understand the nature and scale of the threat they face which in turn will hopefully make them much less likely to fall victim to this type of offence.\" For more identity fraud prevention advice visit the Thames Valley Police website. Individuals and businesses that have fallen victim to a fraud facilitated by an identity crime should report to Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040. |\n|\n|",

It seems to have reached a conclusion based on not properly taking into account all the matters it should. I do not think racism is ever a trivial matter, and I think the sub-committee minimising the hurt in the community and to the people that complained, while taking into account irreverent matters means the decision should be reviewed and the facts looked at again properly and within the rules. The formal decision to essentially clear Cllr Baines despite everyone agreeing his comments were wrong seems ludicrous to most people.\"\nCllr Peter Marland, Leader of the Labour Group said:\n\"The decision of the sub-committee appears flawed. It took matters into account that it should not have done and does not appear to have given sufficient weight to either the recommendations of an independent review of the allegations nor the harm the comments have done. It is very rare for councillors to be asked to review a decision like this, but I believe this matter is so incredibly important that the full committee should debate if a mistake was made in dismissing the matter without any investigation.

There should be a review to introduce a Warden Service to support residents who wish to remain in their own homes in their community.\nThe council, in co-operation with the NHS needs to deliver better services for the growing number of residents suffering from dementia and their families.\nWe have been, and will continue to campaign for a local GP for everyone.\nChildren's Social Care\nThe Liberal Democrats would continue to ensure the protection from harm of all children in MK, and ensure that children in MK Council's care receive the best possible support to flourish physically, mentally and spiritually.\nMental Health\nIt is national policy for the Liberal Democrats that the same level of support should be given to those suffering for physical and mental illnesses. This policy is for those of all ages, and for the support of families.\nFor our policies go to the web page https://www.libdems.org.uk/health/ and find the \"Equal Care for Mental Health\" section. The council should implement all appropriate policies from the Liberal Democrat national policy.\nPriorities for Housing and Development\nBeing at the crossroads between London and Birmingham, and Oxford and Cambridge means Milton Keynes is strategically located, and with the new developments between Oxford and Cambridge there is pressure for Milton Keynes to grow, and we need to get it right for all of our residents.\nWith there being increasing overcrowding in Milton Keynes homes, between sofa surfing and adult residents with children unable to afford to leave their parental home the council needs to use its powers to help make sure everyone who needs a home has one.\nAffordable Housing\nFor new developments we support the strict enforcement of the current policy of 30% of houses being affordable housing, both to buy and for rental, and will continue to push for an increase to 35%, in line with the latest projections of need. As part of the Plan:MK planning process we secured an increase of the share of housing being affordable housing to 31%, which will become local policy pending approval by the government inspector.\nWe do believe that councils should return to building more council homes.\nRegeneration\nWe support the plan to regenerate some of our older estates where the process involves and is supported by those local communities.\nWhen fully supported by local communities, regeneration will lead to high quality homes, greater job opportunities, better health facilities and improved educational prospects.\nWe will not support any 'top-down' imposition of regeneration that doesn't have the support of residents. In order to be successful, all regeneration schemes must be backed by residents, following full and robust consultation. Residents must have a say in the future of their communities.\nFuture Expansion Including Plan:MK\nWe support the aim to build at least 1,750 houses each year in Milton Keynes, ensuring that the highest proportion possible are affordable. This is dependant on the required physical and social infrastructure such as sufficient roads, parking, schools and health centres being in place, while ensuring there are enough green open spaces protected to support access for residents and there is good environmental diversity.\nOur support for well planned expansion is why Liberal Democrat councillors have supported Plan:MK, using their expertise to ensure plans will serve all current and future residents of Milton Keynes. Plan:MK is currently with the government inspector for review.\nA Fair Council Budget in The Face of Cuts\nTraditionally most council funding has come from central government, while council tax has provided a smaller share of local government funding. In the last 8 years our council budget has been cut by £145m by central government, which has meant a fall in money for services for residents despite an increase in council tax.\nThis year alone cuts by the Conservative government in Westminster has made cuts in our council's budget of another £14m this year, and that will continue year on year until at least 2020. While we call for a change in policy from national government, we support moves to maintain a council budget which is sustainable in the long-term in the face of further cuts expected in the future. This will mean we can avoid a situation like the Tory run Northamptonshire County Council running out of money!\nWorking With the Voluntary Sectory, Charities and Parishes\nOur highest priority is to protect the vulnerable from the impact of cuts being imposed by the Tory government in Westminster. To this end, we will continue to work with other organisations to ensure limited resources are used as effectively as possible in order to support our communities.\nWe will support voluntary sector organisations and charities who work with low-income families to find real, long-term solutions to the plight of our most vulnerable individuals and families.\nAs Milton Keynes Council shrinks with imposed cuts, we would work with the Voluntary Sector and Parish/Town councils who may be able to take over some services (such as landscaping) which may otherwise be cut.\nInternal Council Finance and Resources\nWhile the services provided by the council are reduced, the council needs to make its share of cuts. We will push to:\n- Review the spend on the Council refurbishment programme to identify money to put into capital projects such as school builds and city infrastructure.\n- Sell unneeded council land and buildings in order to generate capital receipts to fund investment for the capital programme.\n- Carry out a fundamental review of the budget with a view to minimise or stop unnecessary activities.\n- Ensure that when staff numbers are cut, management staff are cut by a fair share and front-line staff are protected as much as possible. A total of 460 council staff have already been lost due to government cuts.\n- Make sure the council helps fight against tax avoidance by changing the rules on what the council buys and who from.\nMaintaining our Environment\nThe environment is very important to us, which is why in the 9 years that MK Council was Lib Dem controlled between 2002 and 2011 proper investment was put in and recycling rates increased from 11% to 55%! At that time we also made sure that all recycling waste from MK is processed as locally as possible in the UK, which is better than many other councils which send their waste around the world to China to be processed.\nWe also believe that the managed environment should be safe for our residents, landscaping and road repairs should be carried out properly, and our streets should be cleaned and abandoned cars removed quickly.\nRecycling and Waste Collections\nWe will continue to fight to maintain Milton Keynes at the innovative edge of recycling and aim to continually increase MK's recycling rates.\nWe will continue to defend weekly waste collections, and free green bins to make it is easy as possible for residents to dispose of waste properly.\nWe support the Waste Recovery Park in Wolverton as an innovative and efficient way to increase recycling and reduce our impact on the environment.\nThe Managed Environment\nMany of our streets have become increasingly run down. When the Liberal Democrats last ran the Council we tackled environmental neglect by such initiatives as introducing the Graffiti Busters and removing abandoned cars quickly. We would once again look at ways of tackling environmental neglect, such as making the cleansing service more flexible, enabling areas with more frequent problems to receive an adequate service.\nWe will continue to work to improve our management of water and rivers to reduce water consumption and protect MK from flooding, and make sure that that good Flood & Water Strategy is implemented.\nPotholes\nThe Council's current policy on fixing potholes is not fit for purpose. Council policy means they won't be fixed until they are at least 50mm deep, and staff seem to spend more time measuring potholes than fixing them.\nWe recently persuaded the Council to change its pothole policy so that they will now repair a cluster of potholes when only one meets the intervention criteria, but we believe the current intervention level of 50mm is too high and not enough potholes are being repaired. We aim to reduce the intervention level to 30mm, or ideally scrap it so time isn't wasted measuring them.\nWe also believe that pavements and redways need to receive equal attention to ensure they are safe to use, particularly for residents with restricted mobility.\nEducation and Employment\nThe long term success of Milton Keynes depends on ensuring there is a proper environment for small home grown businesses as well as attracting investment from larger companies.\nAlongside employment we will continue to fight for good integrated education at all levels, for lifelong learning, and for a full-time university in Milton Keynes.\nThe Economy\nWe will support the economy by making sure our council uses all powers it can to put in place good infrastructure which encourages inward investment. Long term investment depends on good infrastructure, and we will continue to support and try to improve developments such as the Oxford to Cambridge development arc (with Milton Keynes at the centre) to ensure that any new road and rail links are appropriate to support businesses which may move to Milton Keynes.\nAs with residential spaces, roads and information links need to be set up correctly. Therefore, we will need to support strategic plans such as Plan:MK to ensure that developments are well thought out for the long-term interests of the residents of Milton Keynes.\nEducation and Training\nWe remain committed to a good comprehensive non-selective education for all children. We believe in a good school for everyone. All schools should have a good Special Educational Need Department (SEND) to ensure students with additional needs have good support wherever they are.\nWe'll continue to fight to ensure that schools and enough school places should be available as residents move into areas, and not make students wait for a good school to be built nearby after they have moved in.\nOur policy is to encourage employers to help schools and colleges prepare young people for work, and apprenticeship schemes for lifelong learning.\nWe support the MK:U project for a new university to be built in Milton Keynes.\nPublic Transport\nWe will continue to defend public transport as it is often used by those without access to a car, the elderly, the young and the low paid. Early morning, evening and weekend services are important to ensure those on low pay can get to work 7 days a week.\nIn the last few years we have fought to defend individual bus services in the face of council cuts, however we would look for additional funding to support service improvements.",

The Government claims that this is 'placeholder text' which will be amended at the Committee Stage of the Bill, but has not given assurances that rough sleepers will be protected from the return of this legislation.\nThe repeal of the Vagrancy Act was the culmination of a campaign which began in 2018 for Layla, after it was brought to her attention by a group of students in Oxford. It garnered cross-party support and the support of cross-party groups such as Crisis.

She will ask the City Council to treat care experience as if it were a protected characteristic and to call upon other bodies and organisations to do the same until such time as it may be introduced by legislation.\nCare experienced people include all children, young people, and adults who are, or have been in in care at any stage in their life, no matter how long, including adopted children who were previously looked after.\nCare for children and young people may have been provided in one or many different settings such as residential care, foster care or kinship care.\nIf the motion is passed, the City Council will be required to treat care experience as a protected characteristic, which means that people who have been in care will receive protection in the same way the law treats discrimination against age, race, or disability.\nCouncillor Jane Carr, said:\n“Care experienced people are faced with huge barriers throughout their everyday lives. Through no fault of their own they will experience discrimination which can affect their health, education, employment, and more. Everyone deserves an equal chance and opportunity to fulfil their potential and live their best life. I hope my fellow councillors will support this motion so we can continue to help care experienced people overcome the barriers they face.”\nThis comes as recommendations from a review into children’s social care published last year stated that, the Government should make care experience a protected characteristic and that by doing so, councils, businesses, and other local organisations could put policies in place which would promote better outcomes for care experienced people.\nCouncillor Kerrie Bradburn, the City Council’s Fostering Champion, added:\n“Looking after and protecting children and young people is one of the most important jobs the City Council does. We take our role as corporate parents very seriously and offer a wide range of support to our care leavers such as help with housing, health and wellbeing, finances, education and much more. As corporate parents we need to do everything we can to ensure children under the City Council’s care and care leavers have the same opportunities as our own.”\nThe City Council is currently a legal corporate parent to hundreds of children and young people whose challenging home circumstances mean they need extra support.\nLast month the City Council introduced two full-time positions for young adults leaving care and is calling on local organisations to provide additional training and employment opportunities.",

That's why it's important we continue to do the essentials well and look after our pathways, and this funding will make sure we do exactly that.\"\nLabour Councillor Lauren Townsend, who represents Bletchley West, added:\n\"I am thrilled to see this funding go towards even more footpath and redway improvements across MK. I hope my fellow councillors will support this budget so our hard-working City Council teams can get to work on these improvements in the Spring.\"\nAs part of the 2023/24 budget, nearly £3.5m has also been set aside to fix potholes and roads. Other features include an additional £500,000 to support families through the cost-of-living crisis, £250,000 to launch a Mortgage Interest Rate Relief Fund, and extra funding to support high streets and businesses.\nThe 23/24 budget will be decided at Full Council on Wednesday 22 February.",
  "https_www_mklibdems_co_uk_/https_www_mklibdems_co_uk_news_article_fixing-mk-s-pothole-problem/content_565.html": "Fixing MK's Pothole Problem\nThe state of many estate roads in MK has been a big problem. Thanks to the Lib Dem councillors on MK council the problem policy was changed after the elections in 2018 based on MK Lib Dem policy, and the state of many of our roads and paths are finally starting to improve.\nFor a number of years the bad state of the roads in Milton Keynes have been a growing problem with residents frustrated about why the council hadn't been fixing many large holes in our roads.\nMany had assumed money was the main problem, however the real problem was council policy about what a pothole was. Yes, a pothole to a normal person didn't always count as a pothole for MK council and staff hands were often tied. The policy had been that staff would go out to measure to check what needed fixing, and if a hole was less than 5cm/50mm it wasn't a pothole. Council staff were fixing everything they were supposed to.\nAhead of the 2018 local elections in MK the Labour and Tory parties were falling over themselves to promise to fix more potholes than the other party, however neither were talking about the real problem that council policy needed fixing. The one party with councillors who came up with a good change that would start repairing our roads was the Liberal Democrats.\nReaching a solution\nIn our 2018 manifesto we campaigned:\n- for wider potholes (longer than 300mm/30cm) to be fixed\n- to change the intervention depth level to 30mm/3cm\n- and where a pothole is being fixed, 'clusters' nearby would be fixed even if they didn't meet the normal depth rules\nAfter the elections, despite not being the group running the council our changes were reviewed and they were agreed, the only exception being that the intervention level was set at 40mm/4cm, which we will keep fighting to reduce further.\nThe change has been a big success and the state of our roads are now improving thanks to our Lib Dem councillors.\nWe will still continue fighting for our roads and paths in Milton Keynes to be better maintained so they are safe to use for all residents, including changing the intervention level down still further. Our long term aim is that when staff go out and find potholes in our roads and paths they don't spend time measuring them, they just fix them.",

After the last council elections in 2016, Labour and the Tories each had 22 councillors, with the 13 Lib Dem councillors using their influence to fight for the best for all of the residents across the city of Milton Keynes and the rural areas within the local authority.\nhttps://mklibdems.focusteam.org.uk/files/2018/04/MK_Pie.pngTo ensure the stability of the council the Liberal Democrats entered a partnership agreement with Labour in 2016 which make sure the council has been able to focus on mitigating Tory austerity cuts while serving the residents of MK. The partnership agreement was not a coalition, instead Lib Dems had early sight of some proposals and more influence when deciding what the council will do, to make sure any council proposals were the best possible for all who live in the MK local authority.\nWhile Liberal Democrat councillors in Milton Keynes are local champions who look after their wards and they will have a range of local successes for their residents, below are a list of the achievements MK Lib Dems have had across Milton Keynes:\nHomelessness\nThe Liberal Democrats have been successful is making tackling homelessness a top priority for MK Council.\nWe have managed to get the Council to set up the Homelessness Partnership, which has brought together the various charities and agencies dealing with the issue.\nThe Lib Dems successfully got the Council to accept it had a moral, if not legal obligation, to help so called 'non-statutory' homeless. Although the recent Homelessness Reduction Act now places a duty of Councils to help with advice.\nThe Lib Dems used their influence to get the Council, through the MK Development Partnership, to lease the Old Bus Station to the Winter Night Shelter as their city centre base.\nWe also protested vigorously when Labour proposed housing homeless families to Kettering, and worked with Labour to prepare plans for temporary housing in MK.\nMitigation against Austerity Cuts\nOne of the golden threads running through our approach on the Council has been to protect the most vulnerable from the Conservative Government cuts.\nSince 2010 the Conservatives have vigorously pursued their manifesto commitment to savage cuts in public services. MK Council alone has had to make around £145m worth of cuts and have reduced staff numbers by 460.\nYet demand is on the increase, especially in adult and children's social care which now makes up 58% of the Council's budget spend. We will continue to fight to protect the vulnerable to budget cuts locally, and will the influence of Lib Dem MPs in Westminster to fight to stop the attacks on local councils which should be working for those who need help.\nAffordable Housing\nMK Liberal Democrats successfully changed the strategic plan so that any new developments need to have a higher percentage of affordable housing, increasing the percentage from 30% and 31%. We believe that figure should be even higher at 35%, in line with the latest projections of need, but it was the best that could be done due to Tory Government restrictions which seem to favour developers over residents.\nMore widely, we've succeeded in persuading the council to change the rules so that when Milton Keynes Development Partnership land is developed 36% of the homes should be affordable housing, and we persuaded the council to purchase extra homes to be used as much needed council homes as far as central government in Westminster will allow.\nTo ensure a sustainable future for Milton Keynes and enough homes for our younger residents in the future we played a major role in ensuring Plan:MK will meet our future needs.\nPotholes\nThe Liberal Democrats got a review of the Council's pothole policy so that they will now fix clusters of potholes, instead of fixing the one that meets the 50mm intervention criteria and ignore those immediately around it.\nThe Lib Dems also got £250,000 added to this year's budget specifically for the repair of residential roads.\nRecycling\nThe lib Dems are strong supporters of recycling and when they last ran the Council they increased recycling rates FIVE fold from 11% to 55%. That is why the Lib Dems successfully opposed Labour's plans to charge £33 per year for green bins since it would have reduced recycling rates, and we showed it wouldn't meet Labour's aim of saving money after a similar scheme in Camden failed to meet it's aims.\nThe Lib Dems supported the introduction of clear recycling sacks as this helps identify contaminated sacks more easily.\nThe Environment\nThe Environment is very important to the Liberal Democrats. Residents have complained to us that the physical environment is looking neglected and areas are starting to look run down, which was part of the reason we successfully opposed Labour's plans to make cuts to the Graffiti Busters.\nAlso why last year we got an extra £100,000 in the budget for white lining and this year and extra £100,000 for street sign repairs. We also successfully saved the grit bins, much valued in the recent wintery weather, from proposed cuts.\nWe have also supported keeping our environmental standards high for new buildings, including energy reductions, water saving, adequate drainage and flood protection, and plenty of well-connected green open spaces.\nPublic Transport\nWe have strongly opposed cuts to public transport, protecting some of the vital bus routes which are necessary to many of our residents.\nChildren's Social Care\nThe Liberal Democrats championed an improvement in children's mental health services and fully support the extra funding in this area.",

I think this is a demonstration of the weakness and inexperience of the Labour front bench.\nThe Liberal Democrats would have constructed a completely different budget - one that protected the vulnerable. We are very concerned about the cut to two thirds of supported bus routes. This will disproportionately impact the less well off, the young and the old who rely on buses to get around. We are concerned that those on low incomes who can't afford a car will be forced out of work as they simply will not be able to get there.\nWe are also concerned about the impact on the vulnerable of the cuts to voluntary organisations, as this is short sighted as it will just put pressure on public services elsewhere.\nI am gob smacked that the Labour Administration want to literally throw people out on the streets by cutting the funding to homeless hostels like Orbit and St Mungos.\nAlso you do not both put car parking charges up and cut funding to buses as you are removing the alternative.

Specifically, where you have been a member or a volunteer (or have otherwise engaged with us such as by attending a conference or event, or by responding to a survey or questionnaire) we have a legitimate interest in holding your personal data to help us to monitor the numbers and the diversity of people who engage with us, as well as a legitimate interest in making sure that we can follow up any complaints or grievances which you may raise (or which people may raise about you).\nThe Party will not sell your personal data to third parties.\nDepending on how and why you provide us with your personal data it may be shared within the Party (e.g. between local, regional and national parts of the party) and our elected representatives. It may also be shared with those who provide services to the Party (“service providers”).\nWe may use service providers to undertake processing operations on our behalf to provide us with a variety of administrative, statistical, advertising and technical services. We will only supply service providers with the minimum amount of personal data they need to fulfil the services we request. We oblige all of our data processors to sign contracts with us that clearly set out their commitment to respecting individual rights, protecting your personal data – including not using it for any purpose other than providing us with an agreed service or fulfilling their legal obligations - and their commitments to assisting us to help you exercise your rights as a data subject.\nWith your consent, service providers may hold personal data about you in order to facilitate the provision of future services or financial transactions to which you have agreed, such as a payment processor retaining your payment details in order to process agreed future payments from you.\nPlease note that some of our service providers are based outside of the European Economic Area (the “EEA”). Where we transfer your data to a service provider that is outside of the EEA we seek to ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place to make sure that your personal data is held securely and that your rights as a data subject are upheld – in almost all cases we do this by ensuring that the agreements between us and our chosen service providers contain what are called the ‘model clauses’ that oblige them to treat your personal data as if they themselves were based in the EEA.\nIn addition, we may share your personal data with third parties when we are required to do so by law (for example, with the Police where they ask us to assist them with their investigations). In some cases, this may result in your personal data becoming public.\nIn particular, the Party and our candidates are required to submit records, including personal data, of donations above certain thresholds to the relevant regulatory authority. In some cases, some of these donation details are made public.

I and other leading opposition councillors took only one day to help put back £2.5M into front line services. Just think what we would have achieved if we had had more time.\nThis is not a perfect budget, but it is far better than it was. I am pleased that Lib Dem concerns have been listened to and that £750,000 has been put back into buses so that the less well off, the young and the old who rely on buses can get around. Those on low incomes who can't afford a car will NOT now be forced out of work because there is no transport to get them there. I am pleased that the Labour Cabinet member has confirmed that no routes will now be cut.\nLabour's plans to literally throw people out on the streets by cutting the funding to homeless hostels will not now go ahead with £600,000 back in the budget for homeless hostels.\nThere is also additional funding in the base budget for the CAB, MKSET - Parenting Advice, Luncheon Clubs, Floating Support and wider use for organisations such as the Scouts.\nI also said last week that the double whammy of increased parking charges and reduced employee discount at the same time was unfair. So, we are pleased that nearly half a million pounds of funding has been found to retain the employee discount. The Administration has also committed to increasing the number of parking spaces available.\nHaving gained £2.5M of improvements the Liberal Democrat Group abstained and allowed the revised budget to go through.",

This funding means that as soon as the weather improves, our teams will be out resurfacing roads and filling in thousands of potholes.\"\nCouncillor Andy Reilly, Lib Dem Councillor for Shenley Brook End, added:\n\"I'm pleased that this funding will go towards improving roads across the city, from dual carriageways to minor estate roads. Potholes are inevitable, but it's clear that the Council is doing all it can to tackle them quickly and prevent further damage.\"\nEarlier this month, £3.125m was agreed for road resurfacing and potholes as part of the 22/23 Capital Programme, with an extra £350,000 for additional pothole repairs put forward by the cabinet.\nOther key features of the Progressive Alliance budget include nearly £19m for adults and children's mental health support, over £16m for direct cost of living support for struggling residents, half a million pounds in response to the energy crisis, and additional funding for pest control.",
  "https_www_mklibdems_co_uk_/https_www_mklibdems_co_uk_news_article_mk-lib-dems-back-the-people-s-vote-campaign/content_564.html": "MK Lib Dems Back the People's Vote Campaign\nOn Saturday 20th October a number of MK Lib Dems travelled down to London to support the People's Vote campaign. On the day it is estimated that over 700,000 people marched, the second largest protest this century, with only the Stop the War march with an estimated 1 million people being larger - which is another time the Lib Dems went against the government and media barons to fight on the right side of history!\nThe Milton Keynes Liberal Democrats have been campaigning to support the People's Vote campaign, and it is clear that when people know about the campaign - regardless of how they voted in 2016 - there is a massive amount of support for a People's Vote on any Brexit deal.\nWe felt the time is right to submit a motion to MK council to try to build on the cross-party support for the campaign that already exists.\nWhat is the People's Vote campaign?\nHowever people voted in 2016, it is clear that most people didn't vote for what is now happening!\nPromises and predictions were made on either side, and whichever way people voted, they voted for our country to be better off.\nAmong other things, the Leave campaign promised:\n- More money for the NHS and other services\n- More money for regional development funding\n- Protection of all existing rights, and more rights\n- That the EU needs the UK more than we need them\n- A Leave vote would mean that the EU would give the UK anything we demanded\n- Dozens of trade deals lined up within a few years (i.e. now, and they're not)\n- That leaving the EU would be quick and easy\nMany people voted for the reasons above, and they voted for our country to be better off. Based on how Brexit is going they no longer expect the things they voted Leave for to be delivered.\nIn addition to the positive promises of Leave no longer looking likely, people are unhappy that serious issues such as the following weren't discussed properly at the time of the 2016 referendum, and the debate failed to properly inform them.\n- The complexity of the Northern Irish border\n- Large manufacturers such as Airbus and BMW needing the Customs Union to continue building in the UK\n- US demanding we accept 'chlorine chicken' in any trade deal\nAs a result more and more people are backing the People's Vote campaign, including many who voted Leave in 2016. And the People's Vote campaign isn't one to just stop Brexit, it will be up to the people to decide if Brexit is good enough.\nIf the deal agreed by the government lives up to the promises of 2016 people will vote to Leave again. If any deal agreed fails to live up to the positive promises of 2016, then people will have a right to change their minds!\nWhat are MK Lib Dems Doing?\nWe've been out campaigning making the positive case for a People's Vote, making people more aware (see one of our 'Brexitometers' by clicking here) as Lib Dems, and some of our activists have also been working alongside members of other parties and none as part of the cross-party campaign group European Movement: Milton Keynes (see one of their 'Brexitometers' here!). The People's Vote is in line with the policy our party has had since 2016, as our party has long believed that the promises made by the Leave campaign are undeliverable, and the people should have a right to vote again once the reality of Brexit is known and any deal (or lack of deal!) is on the table.\nIn addition to the People's Vote, one of the highest priorities of our party has been to confirm the rights of those who have come from the EU to work here and contribute, as nurses, teachers and many other essential roles. That is especially true for those who have made a life in the UK, contributing to the UK and bringing up their families here, the government should commit to ensuring the existing rights of non-UK EU citizens already living here are maintained!\nWe have also now submitted a motion to Milton Keynes council, calling on the council to back the People's Vote campaign. The wording of our motion, to be discussed on Wednesday 24th October is below:\nMK People's Vote Councillor McCall - 10 October 2018\n1. That this Council notes that for the 2016 Referendum:\n- There was nationally a vote of 52% to 48% to leave, a close result which was also reflected the voting in Milton Keynes;\n- There were a range of positive promises made by the Leave campaign, including more money for the NHS and other public services, a quick and easy Brexit with a wide range of trade deals negotiated soon after a vote to leave which would be in addition to all existing deals, that all current rights would be protected, and anyone who voted for these positive promises were doing so to make the country better off; and\n- It was right that Parliament give the Government permission to negotiate a deal which lived up to the positive promises of the Leave campaign.\n2. That this Council further notes that since the 2016 Referendum:\n- There are many new issues which the public have become aware of that were not sufficiently discussed during the referendum, including the complexity of the border in Ireland, the opening up of our food sector to 'chlorine chicken' and other similar goods in exchange for any trade deal with the USA and that no new significant trade deals are confirmed, and the risk of losing large manufacturers such as Airbus;\n- None of the possible deals on the table between the UK Government and EU are seen as likely to deliver the promises of the leave campaign;\n- The Government in Westminster has confirmed that it is creating plans to stockpile supplies including food and medicine in the case of a no-deal-Brexit, something that definitely wasn't discussed at the time of the 2016 referendum;\n- The NHS, which was already suffering a staffing shortage is finding it harder to employ staff from elsewhere in the EU and many staff are leaving, which has a much more serious impact in Milton Keynes with a high proportion of staff from elsewhere in the EU and a growing population;\n- Many of the services provided by this Council, including social care, are reliant on staff from elsewhere in the EU and if the Council cannot recruit enough staff then services to many of the most vulnerable in Milton Keynes will be threatened; and\n- There are a large number of non-UK EU nationals living in Milton Keynes who remain concerned at the impact of Brexit on their and their families' futures.\n3. That this Council therefore:\n- calls for non-UK EU citizens already in the UK to be given immediate right to remain, in line with current EU rules;\n- adds it's support to the campaign calling for a People's Vote on any final Brexit deal or no deal with an option to stay in the EU;\n- calls on the Chief Executive to write to the local MPs, the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government and the Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union expressing these views and asking them to support a People's Vote.",

I would like to thank Thames Valley Police for their constructive approach and their guidance of what mistakes to avoid from other local authority areas. To manage traffic, the entrance and approach to some of the sites has been adjusted.

We transformed recycling in MK, improving rates from\n11% when we took over to 55% in 2011, those rates stagnating since in the years\nthe Tories or Labour have led the council. Recycling rates are now expected to\nincrease again with the launch of the Waste Recovery Park, an innovation\nplanned under the last Lib Dem led council in MK.\nWe are the only party in the last 20 to have majority\ncontrol in MK, running MK in more of the last 20 years than any other party!\nWith Tories or Labour having minority control of MK since 2011 our councillors have\nplayed an essential role on the council, holding the other two parties to\naccount and ensuring the best for residents in MK.\nMuch of MK Council's progress to help the homeless off the\nstreets of MK in recent years has been from the hard work and ideas of Lib Dem\ncouncillors.\nOur party continues to put the interests of residents and\ncommunities first and foremost, defending the most vulnerable in society and ensuring\nthe council works for residents. We are enthusiastic and optimistic for Milton\nKeynes and continue to believe that MK can be the city of the future. We will\nfight for enough good homes for all now growing up in MK, for new strategic\nprojects such as a new university and a mass public transport system, while\ncaring for the interests of existing urban and rural residents by ensuring any\nnew developments are well planned with good infrastructure at their heart.\n| Our Key Priorities for 2019/20 Liberal Democrats Demand Better • Action to tackle child poverty • Action to reduce levels of litter • Protection for the most vulnerable from Tory austerity cuts • Support for the homeless to help them off the streets • Action to build more affordable homes to buy and rent • Protection for our bus services • Protection for our environment • Maintenance of our roads, redways, pavements and street lights • Maintenance of our drains to reduce flooding • support for our senior citizens to live independently. |\nWe will always demand better\nfor Milton Keynes.\nKey Achievements in 2018/19\nOver the last few years the Liberal Democrats have engaged\nwith others to ensure the best for Milton Keynes, including helping change\ncouncil policy for the benefit for residents. Some of our Lib Dem successes are\nbelow.\n- Street Homelessness:\nThe Liberal Democrats have helped change council policy to \"housing first\",\nmeaning that those with serious problems-addiction, mental health issues, etc.\nwill be offered housing while they work on the other problems, rather than\nhaving to struggle with them while living on the streets. Over 100 people have\nbeen given housing this year through that policy, and support to help them with\nmental health and addiction problems has increased. For those still living on\nthe streets, Lib Dem councillors have actively helped secure the future of the Winter\nNight Shelter, and enable the MK Bus Shelter and the expansion to the YMCA. - Family\nHomelessness. Most of the homeless in MK are not living on the streets but\nin temporary accommodation. Hundreds of\nfamilies are being housed at the taxpayers expense with no secure future home\nbecause the market has failed to house them.\nAnd many more are in short term accommodation with no guarantee of a\nyear's stay. We have campaigned for more\neffective use of temporary accommodation so that today no-one is housed more\nthan a few miles outside MK, B&B has reduced, and no children are outside\nMK or in B&B. Looking ahead, we've helped plans to build more council\nhousing and affordable housing so that we can reduce the numbers in temporary\naccommodation. - Potholes:\nLiberal Democrat pressure led to change in rules meaning more potholes have\nbeen fixed. Until 2018 the council had a strict policy that only potholes at\nleast 50mm deep would be fixed, meaning council officers spent more time\nmeasuring potholes than fixing them. The Liberal Democrat changes\nmeant the intervention level was reduced to 40mm resulting in more\npotholes being fixed,\nand smaller potholes near ones being fixed are now also being repaired due\nto the new cluster policy. - Environment:\nLiberal Democrats have fought and succeeded to defend against Conservative\nGovernment funding cuts, so that there is still budget to fix street signs and\nto carry out other essential maintenance. In the recent 2019 MK Council budget\nwe succeeded in securing money to address litter 'hot-spots' which need more\nregular litter picks, as part of looking after our borough. For the future, we have secured even stronger\nplanning policies safeguarding our environment as the city grows.\nA City Fit for the Future\nMilton Keynes is a great place to live and to bring up\nchildren, so our birth rate is above the national average - and we are living\nlonger than we were, so our population is rising. Our economy is booming, so, even though\nalmost all local people are employed, we still attract workers from outside -\nand when they get here, they want to live here!\nSo we are growing - and growing fast.\nBy 2050 we estimate that our population will be 450-500,000\npeople. And that means our children will\nneed a lot more places to live, work, go to school, receive healthcare, etc.\nAnd for the cultural life that goes with a big city.\nWe believe that planned growth, planning the infrastructure\nalong with the homes and jobs, is what has made MK successful, so Liberal\nDemocrats are planning for that growth. We want to \"make a great city greater\"-\nand that means strong local policies to make sure that the growth keeps MK\nspecial. Liberal Democrats have been\ninvolved in the current Plan:MK, and are working on plans for MK2050 to secure\nthe infrastructure we will need. The first stage of the 2050 process will come\nout for public consultation later this year.\nA City Fit For Our Children\nLife in MK is not great for all right now. For many people,\nrising housing costs are a nightmare, forcing them into poverty. For others,\ntotal lack of housing means a life on the streets or in temporary\naccommodation. Our low-density city, with poor public transport means they\ncan't get to jobs, services and leisure activities.\nAnd poor access to healthy food, our obsession with the car,\nand insufficient exercise means too many suffer from obesity, leading to\nmassive impacts on their quality of life from diabetes and heart trouble. The\nstress involved leads too many to turn to smoking, alcohol or other addictions,\nwhich in turn lead to poor health, finances, and ultimately homelessness.\nIn particular, this is affecting our children. 25% currently\nlive in poverty. Obesity among children\nis rising to dangerous levels. Hundreds of children live in temporary\naccommodation, unable to maintain friendships, stable schooling and healthcare,\nand generally to feel part of their communities. And thousands are living in\novercrowded accommodation. We MUST demand better.\nIn the pages that follow, we outline priorities to help with\nthe housing crisis, support those on the lowest incomes, help both children and\nadults with mental health problems and reduce obesity. Together those policies\ncan have a serious impact on our children's future. They would be much easier\nto implement if our Government would take children's future seriously. Liberal\nDemocrats continue to work at all levels to demand better for our children.\nDemanding a Good Home for All\nHaving good and affordable homes for all residents is essential to\nmaking sure people have stability in life. Milton Keynes is a great place to\nbring up children, so every generation is larger than the previous one. MK has\nsuccessfully attracted more businesses and employers, and more jobs have\nattracted more people to Milton Keynes. While our population has been\nincreasing, not enough homes have been built so that many families in Milton\nKeynes are living in overcrowded accommodation or 'sofa surfing' between\nfriends and family; there is a hidden homeless crisis in addition to the\nvisible homelessness we have seen on our streets over the last few years.\nThe housing crisis in MK worsens other problems including being a\nsource of much of the poverty in our area. Rough sleeping reached record\nlevels. Many children are being brought up in poverty because of the cost of\nhousing, and where families are forced to move regularly it can seriously damage\nchildren's education, ability to make friends and build personal confidence. We\nare demanding that MK has more housing, the right housing for its needs, at prices\nresidents can afford, and to a decent standard fit for the future.\nEnough Good Homes for the Future, Right for Residents\n- We will strengthen Council policies to ensure\nthat we deliver at least 36% affordable housing on Council and MKDP land as\nwell as the 31% on commercial developments now required in Plan:MK. - We support a new council housing building\nprogramme to build family homes at truly affordable prices. - The council needs to be clear about types and\nsizes of homes we need; in particular, developers are not building enough 3 bed\nhomes that many families need. The council needs to give clear advice and use\nall tools to influence what is built. - There needs to be more safe housing for young\npeople who have left home and aren't able to rent privately. We will support\nthe Council in discussions with the landlords that specialise in young people's\nhousing to bring new schemes to the city. We are pressing for any spare places from\nuniversity accommodation to be available to MK's young adults too. - There are many older residents who feel stuck in\nhomes too large for them to manage and don't have the savings to downsize\nwithout help. MK council should investigate options to support voluntary\ndownsizing. - and finally - we need better information to plan\nthe homes we need. We are pressing for\nthe Council to bring in a housing need register by March 2020. - When the new lettings system comes in, it's\nvital that it gives all residents a fair chance of getting housing based on\nhousing need.\nHomelessness\nHomelessness devastates lives. Thanks to improvements Lib\nDems pushed for over 100 rough sleepers are now in permanent accommodation, but\nthere is more to be done to help rough sleepers and to prevent homelessness.\nFor those who are homeless, proper temporary housing should be available in\nMilton Keynes: it is not good enough to house people miles away or in B&Bs.\nMilton Keynes must be a place where people have a safe, secure place to live.\n- Continue to work with partners to improve\nservices to prevent homelessness, including more support for those with mental\nhealth problems and better advice for those at risk of homelessness. - Continue the Housing First policy to support people\nto get off the streets while they work on improving their mental and physical\nhealth, beat addictions, and improve their work skills. - Continue to press for a sufficient supply of\ntemporary accommodation to ensure that no-one is housed outside MK or in\nB&Bs. - Campaign to end the use of \"Section 21\" that\nallows landlords to evict tenants with no reason - the main route to\nhomelessness in MK.\nImproving the Quality of Housing in MK\n- we support the Council working to bring all\nCouncil homes up to the Governments decent homes standard within 5 years. - We demand that MK Council produces a plan to\nbring all Council homes up to the 'A energy efficiency rating' required for new\nhomes, to help reduce energy costs for residents and reduce MK's carbon\nfootprint. - The council needs to support private renters\ntoo; we support the Council work with private landlords to provide more good\nand affordable housing. - We support the Council in working to advise home\nowners on the help including grants available to bring their property up to\nstandard.\nRegeneration of Older Estates\nOur party supports the plan to regenerate some of our older\nestates where the process involves and is supported by those local communities.\nWe have led scrutiny of the regeneration process and welcome the\nadministration's commitments to implement more transparent and consultative\nprocesses in the future.\nWe support moves to widen the scope of the regeneration\nplans, recognising that needs such as improved access to health care information,\nor healthy food, local employment and training, etc. can be just as important\nas housing. We also support the\nrecognition that demolition is not the only option for improving housing, but\ncontinue to support demolition where the local benefit warrants it and local\nresidents opt for it.\nMaintaining our Managed Environment\nWe believe that the managed environment should be safe for our\nresidents, landscaping and road repairs should be carried out properly, and our\nstreets should be cleaned and abandoned cars removed quickly.\nMany of our streets have become increasingly run down. When the Liberal\nDemocrats last ran the Council we tackled environmental neglect by such\ninitiatives as introducing the Graffiti Busters and removing abandoned cars\nquickly. We would once again look at ways of tackling environmental neglect,\nsuch as making the cleansing service more flexible, enabling areas with more\nfrequent problems to receive an adequate service.\nLandscaping and Open Spaces\nMilton Keynes is suffering from increasing neglect, and\nthere must be a change to fix the issues which have been worsening while the\nConservatives and then Labour have been running the council. We demand better\nfor the removal of weeds and plants in and near paths and roads, since these\ncan both make paths and roads less safe, and can cause avoidable long term\ndamage to our infrastructure. Litter and\ndog mess are hazardous to children, pets and wildlife.\n- The council needs to ensure weeds are removed\nproperly. - Paths must be kept clear and safe to use,\nincluding removal brambles by redways which can be a danger especially to\nchildren and cyclists. - The Council should negotiate with the Parks\nTrust to secure the long term management of our landscaping. - The new money allocated by Liberal Democrats\nshould be used to clear up the litter and dog mess grot spots, while we work\nwith communities to reduce the amount of litter and dog mess.\nImproving our Streets\nIn 2018 the Liberal Democrats had success changing the pothole\npolicy about depth and size to ensure the council repaired more potholes.\n- We will continue to campaign for safer roads and\npaths for residents to use, including ensuring council staff spend more time\nfixing potholes and less time measuring. - Paths and redways must receive better treatment\nas poor surfaces in these areas have a larger impact on more vulnerable\nresidents with limited mobility. - Safe streets need reliable lighting - and many\nof our street lights now need replacing.\nWe will continue to press to speed up the work, and to provide lights\nthat are both energy efficient and effective.\nBetter Water Management to Prevent/Reduce flooding\nWe will continue to work to improve our management of water\nand rivers to reduce water consumption and protect MK from flooding, and make\nsure that that good Flood & Water Strategy is implemented.\n- To ensure good water flow and prevent flooding\nwe will push for the council to work with all appropriate organisations to\nensure all necessary dredging (clearing of blockages) takes place in rivers\nacross MK. - We will push for better maintenance of drains to\nreduce the chance of flooding of roads, redways and properties.\nProtecting the Environment In the World\nThe environment is very important to us, which is why in the 9 years\nthat MK Council was Lib Dem controlled between 2002 and 2011 proper investment\nwas put in and recycling rates increased from 11% to 55%! At that time we also made sure that all\nrecycling waste from MK is processed as locally as possible in the UK, which is\nbetter than many other councils which send their waste around the world to\nChina to be processed.\nSingle Use Plastics\nLiberal\nDemocrats are passionate supporters of campaigns to reduce waste, including the\nelimination of single use plastics. Our party will continue to lead efforts in\nMK Council to reduce waste, and for good support and communication to go to the\npublic and local organisations to reduce the environmental impact in Milton\nKeynes.\nRecycling and Waste Collections\nWe will continue to fight to maintain Milton Keynes at the\ninnovative edge of recycling and aim to continually increase MK's recycling\nrates. Much of the improvement in recycling rates delivered when the Liberal\nDemocrats last ran MK Council was by making it easier for residents to recycle\ncorrectly, and we will campaign for a good system that residents can use.\n- We will continue to defend weekly waste\ncollections, and free green bins to make it is easy as possible for residents\nto dispose of waste properly. - We support the Waste Recovery Park in Wolverton,\ninitiated by the Liberal Democrats, as an innovative and efficient way to\nincrease recycling and reduce our impact on the environment.\nDemand Better Recycling.\nWe will get a grip on Labour's failed policy for the\ndelivery of replacement recycling sacks.\n- We will campaign for a new delivery process\nallowing residents to pick an agreed location at their properties with the\nsacks being delivered to that location within 5 working days. - We will campaign for a return to collection\npoints on a click and collect basis at suitable locations across Milton Keynes,\nensuring residents can collect sacks without a return of the abuse of the free\nsacks made by some companies which used them as packaging. - If the current provider cannot provide the\nrequired changes we will demand a review about who does supply the service for\nMK Council. The Lib Dems will encourage recycling and reduce the amount of\nplastic we are using on replacement sacks.\nPublic Transport\nWe continue to defend public transport as it is essential\nfor those without access to a car, the elderly, young, and the low paid. Early\nmorning, evening and weekend services are essential for the low paid to work 7\ndays a week. But beyond that, a move to more use of public transport, and\ncleaner public transport, is essential if we are to reduce congestion and\npollution and carbon use as we grow.\n- We will continue to fight for bus services to be\nmaintained and improved, for all residents to have access to a service nearby. - The council must continue to support bus\nservices which are vital for local residents, where necessary using subsidy to\nensure vulnerable residents have access to transport links. - We will continue to push for more evening and\nSunday buses. - We will support development of a mass transit\n\"bullet bus\" scheme to reduce congestion as we grow and make public transport more\nattractive. - We continue to support the variety of \"shared\ntransport\" schemes that reduce congestion and pollution from single car use. - We continue to push for electric vehicles to be\nused in all public transport schemes to reduce pollution and carbon use.\nCaring for our Most Vulnerable\nLocal government provides vital services for the care of some of the\nmost vulnerable in our communities. We must continue to demand that MK council\ndelivers the best services possible, ensuring teams and organisations work as\neffectively as possible, and that good systems are in place to ensure teams\ncommunicate well and work as efficiently as possible with limited resources\nAdult Social Care\n- Liberal Democrats\nsupport independent living for our senior citizens, being mindful of the\nimportance of quality support for independent living. - There should be a\nreview to introduce a Warden Service to support residents who wish to remain in\ntheir own homes as well as maintaining the superb care provided at Milton\nKeynes Sheltered Housing Schemes. - We will continue\nto push for MK Council deliver better services for the growing number of\nelderly residents in MK including those suffering from dementia, working\ncollaboratively with the NHS to deliver services and holding the NHS to account\nwhen necessary.\nChildren & Young People: social care\n- To press to\nensure help for families in poverty in Milton Keynes. - To press for\nincreased long-term funding of children's social care. - Improve the\nCouncil's recruitment/retention of high-quality social workers. - Build on the work\nof the Council's Multi Agency Safeguarding Hub (MASH) particularly its\nrelations with schools. - Work with the NHS\nto ensure adequate funding for local youth counselling and mental health\nprovision directed especially at reducing waiting times and, where necessary,\nproviding beds. - Support policies\nto increase the number of foster parents within MK. - Speed up the\nCouncil's adoption procedures in order to reduce the number of children waiting\nfor a family. - Ensure all steps\nare taken to make the transition from children's to adult social care as smooth\nand seamless as possible.\nHealth\n- We will continue to campaign to ensure there is\na local GP for everyone - Where there are new developments in Milton\nKeynes good healthcare provision must be provided to the new residents in a\ntimely way. - We demand that the same level of support should\nbe given to those suffering for physical and mental illnesses, and the council\nshould follow all appropriate policies from the Liberal Democrats national\npolicy \"Equal Care for Mental Health\". https://www.libdems.org.uk/health/ - Ensure that any Brexit effects as to Care staff\nare mitigated as quickly as possible.\nEducation and Employment\nThe long term success of Milton Keynes depends on ensuring there is a proper\nenvironment for small home grown businesses as well as attracting investment\nfrom larger companies.\nAlongside employment we will continue to fight for good integrated\neducation at all levels, for lifelong learning, and for a full-time university\nin Milton Keynes.\nThe Economy\nWe will support the economy by making sure our council uses\nall powers it can to put in place good infrastructure which encourages inward\ninvestment. Long term investment depends\non good infrastructure, and we will continue to support and try to improve\ndevelopments such as the Oxford to Cambridge development arc (with Milton\nKeynes at the centre) to ensure that any new road and rail links are appropriate\nto support businesses which may move to Milton Keynes.\nAs with residential spaces, roads and information links need\nto be set up correctly. Therefore, we\nwill need to support strategic plans such as Plan:MK to ensure that\ndevelopments are well thought out for the long-term interests of the residents\nof Milton Keynes.\nEducation\n- Campaign to restore responsibility for education\nto local authorities - Invest in high quality early years education in\norder to improve all our children's life chances - Oppose any moves towards selective education and\nfight for a good comprehensive education for all children - All schools should have a good Special\nEducational Need Department (SEND) to ensure students with additional needs\nhave good support wherever they are - Spread good teaching practice across the MK\nCouncil area so as to improve the education for our children - Support the Youth Cabinet's Curriculum for Life\n- Help our secondary schools improve their careers\nadvice services - Support the work of Milton Keynes College including\nin its links with business, apprenticeships, life-long learning and move to the\ncity centre - Support MK:U and the universities of\nBedfordshire and Buckingham in their current and planned higher education\nprovision within the city - We will continue to defend the policy that\nschools with enough places should be available as residents move into areas,\nnot making students wait for a good school to be built nearby after they have\nmoved in\nA Good Council in The Face of Cuts\nTraditionally most local council funding has been from central\ngovernment grants, council tax providing a smaller share of funding. In the\nlast 8 years central government has cut MK Council's budget by £145m, resulting\nin a fall in money for services for residents despite an increase in council\ntax.\nWhile we call for a change in policy from central government, we will\nfight for a council budget which is sustainable in the long-term in the face of\nfurther cuts expected in the future. This will mean we can avoid a situation\nlike the Tory run Northamptonshire County Council running out of money!\nWhile funding is being cut, the council also needs to look for ways to\nbetter spend the resources it has, this includes working alongside other\ncouncils for joint services and investing in technology to ensure staff can\nprovide the best services possible in the most efficient ways.\nTo Maintain a Stable Financial Position with a Balanced Budget\nDespite the talk of the end of austerity, Milton Keynes faces\nongoing challenges as the Rate Support Grant comes near to an end. We need to\nmaintain the stable situation that two balanced budgets for Milton Keynes\nCouncil have created while avoiding any effects on front line services.\n- No cuts to libraries, Children Services and\nmaintaining Adult Social Care at a high level. - Continue MK Council exploring shared services\nwith other local councils to enable ongoing savings in things like HR and\nPayroll also including procurement. - Ensuring the Council has the best IT system in\nplace to help deliver a good and cost-effective service to residents. - Maintaining council reserves at a level that\nwill in the short term avoid the Council becoming insolvent through lack of\nfinance. - Joining with the Local Government Association\nfor a sustainable financial agreement with Central government which can protect\nservices for residents, since the current Conservative government's plans are\nexpected to cause more councils to run out of money like Northamptonshire\n(section 114 notices).\nDigital Transformation to Improve Services\n- We will accelerate the Council's digital\ntransformation programme to make services available online for those who wish\nto use them, ensuring that all Council applications are tablet and mobile\ncompatible. The Lib Dems will take inspiration from the best online services we\nsee from other Councils, and be forward-thinking in seeking efficiencies and\nimproved services.\nBetter Reporting Systems for Residents\nResidents need a good system to report issues, which should\nbe as efficient, reliable and transparent as possible to give greater\nconfidence.\n- Demand\nbetter reporting for roads issues. We will ensure that residents can report\nonline missing and broken street signs, and roads needing line repainting. The\nLabour administration have removed these options due to budget cuts - we will\ncampaign to reverse this and call for a review in the next budget to understand\nthe scale of work needed. The Lib Dems are determined to restore pride in our\nestates and streets. - Demand\nbetter on recycling sacks a better system to order recycling sacks; see the section in \"Protecting the\nEnvironment in the World\".\nDemand Better for Grieving Parents\nWe demand the council be compassionate and humane to those\nwho have lost a child. The Government has failed to deliver on their pledge to\nset up the Child Funeral Fund despite this being promised by the Prime Minister\nin April 2018. In the interim we will campaign to allocate money for the\ncouncil to match this pledge, and to not charge for child burials or cremations\nfor those under the age of 16. We will put pressure on the Government to make\ngood their pledge. The Lib Dems will always support those at their time of\ngreatest need.\nWorking With the Voluntary Sector, Charities and Parishes\nOur highest priority is to protect the vulnerable from the\nimpact of cuts being imposed by the Tory government in Westminster. We will\ncontinue to work with other organisations to support our communities as\nefficiently as possible.\nWe will continue to support voluntary sector organisations\nand charities who work with low-income families to find real, long-term\nsolutions to the plight of our most vulnerable individuals and families. And we\nwill review the use of the short term help funds the Council offers to those in\ndire need.\nAs Milton\nKeynes Council shrinks with imposed cuts, we would work with the Voluntary\nSector and Parish/Town councils who may be able to take over some services\nwhich may otherwise be cut.\nBeliefs of the Liberal Democrats\nTaken from the preamble to the party constitution\nThe Liberal Democrats exist\nto build and safeguard a fair, free and\nopen society, in which we seek to balance the fundamental values of liberty, equality and community, and in\nwhich no one shall be enslaved by\npoverty, ignorance or conformity.\nWe champion the freedom, dignity and well-being of\nindividuals, we acknowledge and respect their right to freedom of\nconscience and their right to develop their talents to the full. We aim to\ndisperse power, to foster diversity and to nurture creativity. We believe that the role of the state is to enable all\ncitizens to attain these ideals, to contribute\nfully to their communities and to take\npart in the decisions which affect their lives.\nWe look forward to a world in\nwhich all people share the same basic\nrights, in which they live together\nin peace and in which their different cultures will be able to develop\nfreely. We believe that each generation\nis responsible for the fate of our planet and, by safeguarding the balance\nof nature and the environment, for the long-term continuity of life in all its\nforms.\nUpholding these values of\nindividual and social justice, we reject\nall prejudice and discrimination based upon race, colour, religion, age,\ndisability, sex or sexual orientation and oppose all forms of entrenched privilege and inequality.\nRecognising that the quest for freedom and justice can never end, we promote human rights and open government,\na sustainable economy which serves genuine need, public services of the highest quality, international action based\non a recognition of the interdependence\nof all the world's peoples and responsible stewardship of the earth and its resources.\nOur responsibility for\njustice and liberty cannot be confined by national boundaries; we are committed to fight poverty,\noppression, hunger, ignorance, disease and aggression wherever they occur\nand to promote the free movement of ideas, people, goods and services. Setting aside national sovereignty when\nnecessary, we will work with other countries towards an equitable and peaceful\ninternational order and a durable system of common security.",

The whole thing stinks. These salaries and perks have reached eye-watering levels, yet Conservative Ministers refuse to act.”\nCouncillor Robert Exon who sits on the Internal Drainage Board, added:\n“It is shocking that there was no mention whatsoever of sewage in the King’s Speech. It’s time that Anglian Water stopped putting profits and bonuses before the environment. The firm is clearly not working how it should and is not listening to local concerns on sewage discharges.”\nCouncillor Bradburn, concluded:\n“This country’s water industry has become a gravy train where sewage and money flows freely. This is a scandal and happening on the Government’s watch. When will Conservative Ministers finally get tough on these polluting and profiteering firms?”",

However, their calls have gone unanswered as the City Council is yet to implement this.\nLiberal Democrat Leader on Milton Keynes City Council, Councillor Jane Carr, who represents Newport Pagnell South, said:\n“Four years on, many residents still remain concerned about the lack of coordinated action to prevent future floods. In September, Newport Pagnell was hit yet again with heavy rainfall which caused areas of the town to flood. Thankfully, the local flood group went above and beyond to help residents by distributing sandbags and closing roads. I am pleased that the community are so supportive, but this is not a substitute for a city-wide strategy and more investment.”\nResidents in Newport Pagnell have formed a local flood group consisting of dedicated volunteers who help to alert the emergency services of any potential flooding and provide lightweight defence bags.\nThe active flood group that works closely with the City Council’s Flood team, local Town Council, and the Environment Agency has been instrumental in educating residents and raising awareness on flood risks and practical prevention measures.\nFellow Newport Pagnell South Ward Councillor Andy Carr, added:\n“Flooding has a devastating impact on communities and as climate change continues to increase the likelihood of extreme weather, the effects on residents will be more severe. We need a robust and long-term plan for flood prevention before it continues to cause more disruption for residents who live in areas that are at risk of flooding.”",

The party is calling on the government to invest in GP services to ensure people can get a doctors' appointment when they need one.\nFurther analysis by the British Medical Association (BMA) shows a dismal picture overall for GPs, with there being the equivalent of over 1,900 fewer fully qualified, full-time GPs now than there were in 2015.\nThe picture is similarly bleak when compared to the UK's international neighbours. OECD stats from 2019 show that the UK's average of three doctors per 1,000 people ranks below the likes of Hungary and Czech Republic, and only just ahead of Brazil and Mexico.\nCouncillor Jane Carr, Liberal Democrat Deputy Group Leader on Milton Keynes Council, said:\n\"The Conservative government are badly letting down both GPs and patients in Milton Keynes, residents deserve a fair deal. Instead of fixing the GP shortage crisis, the Conservatives are making it worse by failing to train the new doctors we desperately need.\"\nThe worsening GP shortage has given rise to a postcode lottery, with our hard-working GPs overstretched and people left waiting too long for treatment or even an appointment.\"\nFamilies rely on being able to see a GP when they or their children fall sick to get advice, access treatment and get well again. The government must invest more in our GP practices and train up more doctors, to ensure patients get the fair deal they deserve.\"",

Not only is it the centre of the local community but dozens of people rely on its services every day to withdraw cash or to pay bills.

Treating the provinces as alien curiosities.\nThose people in Preston and Sunderland and Newport see a divide between those who win and those who lose. When the country is booming, they don't see the benefit. And when the country is in decline they are the first to be hit.\nThose people ... wanted, quite understandably, to give the powerful a kicking. So they did.\nAt that meeting they talked about low wages. About poor housing. About strains on hospitals and schools. Their problems weren't caused by the European Union, they were caused by powerful people who took them for granted.\nBy politicians who have spent decades chasing cheap headlines and short-term success for their political careers, and never acting in the long-term interests of the whole country.\nSo those people in that room, like millions of others, wanted, quite understandably, to give the powerful a kicking. So they did.\n...he then set out how he wants to reach out to Leave voters...\nI wanted Britain to remain in the European Union and I still do. But we have got to listen, to learn and to understand why millions of people voted to leave. We can't just tell them they're wrong and stick our fingers in our ears.\nSo I want to do two things.\nI want to persuade those who voted leave that we understand and respect their reasons, that we are determined to take head on the things about today's Britain that have left so many people feeling ignored and I want to give them their say over what comes next.\n...next, he turned to Theresa May and her \"plan\" for Brexit...\nTheresa May - tell us what Brexit really means. You've had three months. You are the Prime Minister. Stop dithering. What is your plan?\nThe Liberal Democrats have a plan. We know what we want and we know where we want to take our country. When Theresa May does agree a deal with the EU, we want the people to decide.\nNot a re-run of the referendum, not a second referendum, but a referendum on the terms of the as-yet-unknown Brexit deal.\n...he then turned to the refugee crisis...\nThe biggest crisis facing our continent since the Second World War. They did nothing to help right until the point they thought it was in their short-term interest to act, when a photo of three-year-old Aylan Kurdi face down in the sand was on the front page of every newspaper.\nThe people were shocked, heartbroken, they demanded action and the Tories did the bare minimum. But since the front pages have moved on, they have barely lifted a finger.\nNow there are some on the centre left who are squeamish about patriotism, but not me. I'm proud of my country; I hate it when my government makes me ashamed.\nI hate it when my government makes me ashamed.\n...and told a story from Lesbos...\nWe'd helped to land a flimsy boat of desperate refugees, I was handing out bottles of fresh water and a few yards away was an aid worker from New Zealand, who knew that I was a British politician.\nShe looked at me and shouted,\nstop handing out bottles of water and take some f***ing refugees\nBecause that is how Britain is seen. Mean and not pulling its weight. And maybe that doesn't bother some people, but it bothers me.\nBecause I am proud of who we are - always a sanctuary for the desperate, the abused and the persecuted; and I will not stand by and watch my country become smaller, meaner and more selfish.\nThat is not Britain. We are better than that.\n...he then turned to the NHS and social care in England...\nFor years, politicians have chosen to paper over the cracks rather than come clean about what it will really take - what it will really cost - not just to keep the NHS afloat but to give people the care and the treatment that they deserve.\nAnd that means, finally, bringing the NHS and the social care system together.\n...and laid out why improving social care matters to him...\nIn my Grandpa's journey through Alzheimers, he had good care in the home he spent his last couple of years in. But when he first became ill after the death of my Grandma, the place he was put in was despicable.\nLonely, unclean, uncaring. It's a few years back, but as I fought to get him out of that place and into somewhere better, it occurred to me that this was a standard experience for too many older people and their loved ones.\nMaybe some people can just shrug and accept this, well I can't.\nI've seen enough terrible old people's homes. And I've seen enough people who've had to wait forever for treatment - particularly people who don't have someone to fight their corner. It's not civilised to let people slip through the net.\nIt's not civilised towards the people who love them, who go out of their way to try and make their lives easier when everything else is making their lives harder. It's not civilised and it's not good enough.\n...and proposed a solution to improve social care and make our NHS fit for the future...\nWe need to face the hard truth that the NHS needs more money - a lot more money- not just to stop it lurching from crisis to crisis but so that it can meet the needs and the challenges it will face in the years ahead. So that it can be the service we all need it to be for the long-term.\nThat means having the most frank and honest conversation about the NHS that the country has ever had. What Beveridge did for the 20th century, we need for the 21st century.\nWe need to face the hard truth that the NHS needs more money - a lot more money\nIn Norman Lamb we have the politician who is most trusted and respected by the health profession - and deservedly so. And Norman and I are clear, we will not join the ranks of those politicians who are too scared of losing votes to face up to what really needs to be done.\nWe will go to the British people with the results of our Beveridge Commission and we will offer a new deal for health and social care, honest about the cost, bold about the solution. If the only way to fund a health service that meets the needs of everyone, is to raise taxes, Liberal Democrats will raise taxes.\n...Tim then turned to our schools...\nGovernments have designed an education system especially at primary school level that is focused not on developing young people for later life, for work or for further study, but on getting them through the wrong kinds of tests.\nIt's not about whether kids can solve problems, or converse in other languages - or even their own. It's about statistics. Measurements. League tables.\nInstead of building an education system, we have built a quality assurance industry.\nInstead of building an education system, we have built a quality assurance industry.It's no wonder so many teachers are so frustrated. No wonder so many leave the profession.\n...and laid out a plan to reduce testing and give teachers freedom to teach...\nI want our schools to be places where our teachers have the freedom to use their skill and their knowledge to open young minds, not just train them to pass exams.\nI want them to be places where children are inspired to learn, not stressed out by tests.\nSo I want to end the current system of SATS in primary schools that are a distraction from the real education that professional teachers want to give their children; that weigh heavy on children as young as six and add nothing to the breadth of their learning.\n...and then launched a blistering attack on grammar schools...\nWhat are we doing, in 2016, threatening to relegate 80% of our children to education's second division by returning to the 11-plus? Every parent wants to send their kids to a good school. But more selective schools are not the answer.\nWe need better schools for all our children, not just those who can pass an exam at the age of 11. We can't just leave children behind.\n...he then turned to his problem with Jeremy Corbyn...\nMy problem with Jeremy Corbyn is that, for him, holding the government to account is not a priority. Winning elections is a bourgeois distraction - unless it's his own leadership election.\nIt is baffling to see the Labour Party arguing about whether or not they should even be trying to win an election.\nCan you imagine that? The Liberals and Liberal Democrats spent decades out of power and then when the opportunity finally came - in incredibly difficult circumstances, when the easiest thing in the world would have been to walk away - we chose to take power because we knew the point of politics is to put principles into action. To get things done. Not just to feel good, but to do good.\nIt is baffling to see the Labour Party arguing about whether or not they should even be trying to win an election.\nSo we took power … and we got crushed. So you could forgive us for thinking twice about whether power is really worth it.\nBut of course it's worth it.\nHaving fine principles but no power is just turning your backs on the people who need you the most, its letting someone else win the day.\n...and had a message to everyone who wants a real opposition to the Tories..\nWhichever party you supported at the last election, we all know that Britain needs a decent, united opposition. So if Corbyn's Labour has left the stage, then we will take the stage.\nBritain needs a strong opposition. The Liberal Democrats will be that strong opposition.\n...Tim then set out his plan to build a Britain that's open, tolerant and united...\nSo here is my plan. We will dramatically rebuild our strength in local government, deliberately, passionately, effectively.\nWinning council seats is our chance to shape, lead and serve our communities to put liberalism into practice.\nLiberals believe in local government, I believe in local government, every council seat matters to me.\nSo my challenge to you is to pick a ward and win it, and my commitment to you is that I choose to build our party's revival on victories in every council in the country.\nAnd my plan includes continuing to grow our party - our membership is up 80% in just 14 months - but that is merely a staging post, we will continue to build a movement that can win at every level.\nI will lead the Liberal Democrats as the only party committed to Britain in Europe, with a plan to let the people decide our future in a referendum on the as yet non-existent Tory Brexit deal.\nI will lead the only party with a plan for our country's long-term future. Green, healthy, well-educated, outward-looking, prosperous, secure.\nI will build the open, tolerant, united party that can be the opposition to this Conservative government. On NHS underfunding, on divisive grammar schools, on its attacks on British business.\nI want the Liberal Democrats to be ready to fill the gap where an official opposition should be. I want the Liberal Democrats to be the strong, united opposition.\nThat is my plan. I need you to join me to fight for it.\nJoin us\n...Tim then set out the biggest threat to the Tories...\nWell, look, no one believes, whether boundary changes happen or not, that Labour will gain a single seat from the Tories. The SNP could only possibly take one seat off the Conservatives. But there are dozens of Tory seats in our reach.\nWhich means that the only thing standing between the Conservatives and a majority at the next election is the revival of the Liberal Democrats.\n...he gave a warning about Brexit and coined a phrase...\nWhen Conservatives talk about a 'hard Brexit', this is what they mean. A Brexit that cuts us off from our neighbours, no matter what the consequences for people's jobs and livelihoods.\nA Brexit that toys with the lives of hard-working people who have made Britain their home, paid their way and immersed themselves in their communities, just as more than a million Brits have made their homes on the continent.\nA Brexit that will leave us poorer, weaker and less able to protect ourselves. But we will not let Nigel Farage's vision for Britain win. To coin a phrase. I want my country back.\n...and Tim closed with this note of hope for our party.\nTogether, we must fight to keep Britain open, tolerant and united. Together, the Liberal Democrats must be the real voice of opposition. Together, we must win.",

This resulted in thousands of people across the UK being stripped of their British passports, right to work, healthcare, and benefits.\nThe scheme that was launched more than 4 years ago has so far only resulted in 1,518 people receiving compensation for their suffering, and a further 1,988 with eligible claims have been awarded no compensation.\nCouncillor Uroy Clarke of Broughton Ward, who is Jamaican born, said:\n“Just last month we saw the 75th anniversary of HMT Empire Windrush arriving in Britain on 22 June 1948. The anniversary was celebrated by many including some of the amazing charities and organisations that we have here in Milton Keynes. But how can we properly celebrate the contributions the Windrush generation has made to the city whilst this is hanging over us? The Windrush generation are victims through no fault of their own, they have worked hard all their lives, paying tax and national insurance yet they are being denied compensation they are rightfully owed, it is disgraceful.”\nCurrently, those affected must complete a 44-page claim form to receive compensation for losses relating to employment, immigration fees, housing, health, education, and living costs, amongst other factors that have impacted their daily lives.\nLib Dem councillors have heavily criticised the scheme, arguing that the application process is long, complex, and that the requirements make it almost impossible for people to prove their status.\nCouncillor Robin Bradburn, Deputy Leader of Milton Keynes City Council, added:\n“It is heart breaking that people have been forced out of their homes and jobs, and with no access to housing, benefits, or healthcare have been left to suffer and with no choice other than to end up in debt. To then fill out a 44-page long application form is ridiculous! The Government must make the scheme more accessible.”\nCouncillor Clarke will move the motion asking the Chief Executive of the City Council to write to the Home Secretary Suella Braverman asking for the Windrush Compensation Scheme to be more accessible, for legal aid to be awarded, and to request the appointment of a migrant’s commissioner, and to commit to holding reconciliation events as suggested in the Windrush Lessons Learned Review.\nThe Windrush Lessons Learned Review was published in March 2020 conducted to identify causes of the scandal and key lessons for the Home Office.\nThe Government failed to adopt the remaining 3 recommendations outlined in the report:\n- Appoint a Migrant’s Commissioner responsible for speaking up for migrants and those affected\n- Holding a series of reconciliation events with people impacted to listen and reflect on their stories\n- Giving the independent chief inspector of borders and immigration (ICIBI) new powers\nIf the motion is passed, the City Council will also be required to continue to celebrate and honour the huge contributions of the Windrush generation in Milton Keynes and ensure the appointedEthnic Minority Champion attends Windrush celebrations each year.\nLast year the City Council announced that the role of an Ethnic Minority Champion was being created and going forward will provide representation and advocating for issues that are faced by Ethnic Minority communities.",

Not everyone is able to book online, through an app, or via a ticket machine. Customers such as the elderly, those with disabilities, and those with impaired eyesight significantly rely on the help and guidance from ticket office staff. Government plans to close the ticket offices, will mean less staff available to offer support and guidance which will make it even harder for some passengers to travel by train.”\nCouncillor Trendall will move the motion, asking the Chief Executive of the City Council to write to the Secretary of State for Transport Mark Harper, RDG and London Northwestern Railway bosses to express the City Council’s opposition to the proposed changes.\nNationally, the Government’s proposals to shut ticket offices could result in up to 2000 job losses across the network.",

Extra activities will also be put in place this winter from 2-5 January 2024 which will ensure fun activities and free hot food.\nFunding for Parish and Town Councils: The City Council will be providing even more funding to help Parish and Town Councils run warm spaces this winter, which will include social clubs, community cafes, and other informal activities.\nHelp with energy and housing costs: Thousands of pounds has been allocated to provide financial support for tenants and private renters to help people who are falling into rent arrears.\nFunding charities to help their work go further: Charities across the city such as MK Food Bank and Citizens Advice will receive a financial boost so they can reach more people.\nCabinet Member for Tackling Inequalities and Child Poverty, Councillor Jane Carr, said:\n“High energy prices and rising food costs continue to devastate the city’s most vulnerable residents, all whilst the Conservatives sit by and watch people suffer. That’s why for the second year running we have put a Winter Plan in place to support our residents through serious financial hardship.\n“Providing funding for those who need it the most, will put the City Council and our local partners in a better position to help manage demand. We are only able to make this commitment thanks to years of handling our finances responsibly and carefully planning ahead, which has put us in a better position than many other local authorities.”\nLast year, Lib Dem Councillor Sam Crooks proposed a motion which declared a cost-of-living emergency, the City Council then spent £3.3 million pounds to support projects that provided food, reduced energy bills, and gave other financial help and support to the city’s residents.\nRead the Winter Plan and find other cost-of-living support here.",

This includes a fall of 97 GP surgeries in the southeast over that period.\nCouncillor Jane Carr, Cabinet Member for Public Health, said:\n“We need a return to proper local health services that people can rely on. Communities in Milton Keynes just want strong health services, but years of neglect has caused a GP shortage crisis. The Tories have failed to deliver what they promised, and now residents are suffering, leaving them unable to see their local doctor when they need to.”\nLiberal Democrat Leader Ed Davey launched the party’s local election campaign last week with a pledge to recruit more GPs and give patients a legal right to see a GP within 7 days, or 24 hours in an emergency. This would be achieved through increasing training places for GPs, a programme to retain experienced doctors and staff, and launching a recruitment drive to encourage those who’ve left the NHS to return.",

  "https_www_mklibdems_co_uk_/https_www_mklibdems_co_uk_news_article_lib-dems-set-terms-for-partnership-negotiations-for-mk-council/content_645.html": "Lib Dems Set Terms for Partnership Negotiations for MK Council\nOn 3rd May 2018 the voters of Milton Keynes did not give any party a clear mandate to run Milton Keynes. Labour won a few more seats, the Tories won a few more votes, and Lib Dems hold the balance of power which we'll use to defend the long term interests of Milton Keynes and our residents across the borough.\nhttps://mklibdems.focusteam.org.uk/files/2018/05/Lib-Dem-Priorities-V2.png\nWhile there is no explicit mention of homelessness the long term solution is to make sure there is enough affordable and social housing so that the council can care for all who are in need. No potholes? All parties agreed more needs to be done - the challenge isn't the will, it is making sure the policy is set right.\nThe following are our key negotiating points.\nMore affordable housing, and more social housing to help those in need\nThere is a homelessness crisis in MK, and while those on our streets need most immediate help there are also many residents in MK who are sofa surfing between friends until they have nowhere else to live, and overcrowded houses where a house built for a small family has three generations living in it because a generation with children are struggling to move out of their parent's home. The only way to solve these problems going forward is to make developers build a greater proportion of affordable housing, and make sure the council has enough social housing to care for those in desperate need of a home.\nMore investment in children and adult social care\nThose in the care of the council are some of the most vulnerable in our society, and the council needs to do more to make sure it does enough for these individuals. The Liberal Democrats will fight for more investment spent well so the council lives up to the expectations that the residents of MK and those in our care should have.\nEndorsement of the Plan:MK strategic plan submitted to government\nPlaced at the centre of the Oxford - Cambridge development arc, and between London and Birmingham the government will force MK to expand. Strategic plans such as Plan:MK are our chance to take destiny into our own hands and make sure expansion is in the long term interest of our residents, their children and their grandchildren, and that developers don't get to build on the cheap without giving the right money for infrastructure.\nSupport for the expansion of the city to 500k residents by 2050\nMK is going to continue expanding because of our location. The chances are that by 2050 MK will be reaching 500k even if some people might resist it. By engaging with the government properly we'll be able to fight for the right long term infrastructure within MK and between MK and the rest of the country (and world!). We must take every positive opportunity to take control of the destiny of MK.\nInvest more in litter picking and landscaping to care for MK\nMK is becoming increasingly run down. Alongside a priority to fix potholes we must also make sure that there is the right amount of money spent to keep our streets clean and clear for our residents.\nEffective devolution of services to parish/town councils\nAs the Tory government in Westminster continues to slash the council budget of MK (another £14m this year) some services may be best run closer to the community within Town, Parish and Community councils. The Liberal Democrats believe that there must be positive engagement to make sure the right services are delivered by the right level of government.\nNo grammar schools\nLiberal Democrats will continue to defend non-selective education, and we will continue to oppose the opening of any new grammar schools in Milton Keynes.\nBest value for money as key criterion for awarding contracts for services\nThe Liberal Democrats believe that the most important part of a decision to decide who provides a particular service to residents is value for money (not necessarily cheapest!), not who provides the service. Whoever might run a service, we must make sure that it is based on evidence that it is the best value for money for council tax payers.\nLow carbon agenda to reduce our impact on the environment\nThe Liberal Democrats are the party that took the MK recycling rate from 11% to 55% in the early 2000s, and we continue to be passionate about MK doing it's part to protect our local and the global environment. We fully support having a low carbon agenda, alongside reducing our use of single-use plastics and other critical policies to protect our future.\nSet the council budget within the current Medium Term Financial Plan\nAs the Tory government in Westminster continues to slash our council's budget we can't support any party which would raid the reserves in exchange for short term headlines. Whichever party runs the council they must make sure there is a sustainable budget which will protect our area in the long-term, and avoid the council running out of money has happened in neighbouring Northamptonshire.\nIn conclusion, while we will support other parties in areas where there is absolute agreement that we must prioritise more help for those who are homeless and fixing potholes to make our roads, paths and redways safe to use, we must make sure that the council will look after the long term interests of MK and that any expansion is well planned into the future.",

  "https_www_mklibdems_co_uk_/https_www_mklibdems_co_uk_news_article_a-national-disaster-we-ll-keep-fighting/content_591.html": "A National Disaster. We'll Keep Fighting.\nThe results of the December 12 General Election are a disaster for our country. The continuing battle will be to hold the Conservatives to account for any harm they do while we fight to protect the most vulnerable.\nDuring his General Election campaign Boris Johnson claimed other people were to blame for problems in our country and Brexit not happening, successfully deflecting responsibly from him and his wing of the Conservative party. Now that Johnson has a large majority of the MPs in Parliament it means that whatever happens now, he will own the results. Johnson won't be able to blame anyone else.\nJohnson also made lavish policy promises during the election campaign. He promised 40 new hospitals, when funding only exists for 6, and when asked he failed to explain where money for the other 34 'new' hospitals would come from. Johnson promised a new £10.50 minimum wage as a way to help the poorest workers but has since winning downgraded it to 'maybe' happening by 2024 \"provided economic conditions allow\". It would be a 'pleasant' surprise if Johnson delivers on all of his spending commitments. If he doesn't we'll need to keep the commitments on the agenda and hold him to account.\nPeople's Vote Denied by FPTP\nIt is worth commenting that this is another election where the awful First Past the Post (FPTP) election system has stolen people's voices. First, many people in almost the whole country voted \"against\" a party they hate more rather than \"for\" a party they like. It was clear while out canvassing during the election that many were voting Conservative not because of anything that party had to say, but because they were unhappy with Labour and feared the idea of Corbyn winning. If we had a proper electoral system like Single Transferrable Vote (STV) which is already used and popular in Northern Ireland and for Scottish local elections then people could give a first preference to their preferred party/candidate even if they have little chance of winning, and only then consider who they're 'voting against'.\nNext, while the Conservatives won a comfortable majority in parliament (56.2% of seats), they won a minority of votes (43.6% of votes), and the parties wanting a People's Vote won more votes combined than the combination of Con/UKIP/Brexit Party. When most of Europe has rightly consigned FPTP to history and moved to more representative electoral systems it should be a matter of shame that our country is stuck in the past with a system that saw the Tories national vote increase by only 1.2% and obtain a landslide win by seats, while the Lib Dems went up by 4.2% of the national share and ended with fewer seats in Parliament.\nGeneral Election in Milton Keynes\nWithin Milton Keynes the election for both seats were seen as two horse races between Labour and the Conservatives following the close results in 2017, with both of those parties fighting the seats hard.\nWhile Liberal Democrats ran a campaign in MK having two excellent candidates (Aisha Mir in MK North and Saleyha Ahsan in MK South) as a party which targets resources, help from MK was sent to Buckingham (where Liberal Democrats came second), and to St Albans where Liberal Democrats won and the excellent Daisy Cooper was elected as an MP.\nThe vote change in Milton Keynes\nmoved roughly in line with national vote changes, with the Liberal Democrats seeing\nthe largest increase in vote, with a small increase for the Conservatives, and\na significant drop for Labour. The change in vote for both Labour and\nConservatives were better than the national average, perhaps because the Brexit\nParty didn't stand in either MK seat.\nThose results mean the Conservatives held off Labour's challenge and won both seats with increased majorities.\nThank you to all of the Liberal Democrat members and supporters in Milton Keynes who helped in MK and in other more winnable seats such as Buckingham and St Albans.\nWhat Now for Brexit\nWhile Liberal Democrats will keep fighting to Stop Brexit, the size of Johnson's majority means he has the initiative, and it will take Conservative problems in delivering their Brexit to stop it happening. Given the talent on the Conservative front bench (Dominic Raab not realising Dover was important, Priti Patel trying to change UK government policy after meetings with a foreign government kept secret from the UK government while on a \"family holiday\", to Boris Johnson' incompetence condemning a British citizen to prison in Iran due to his regular failure to read his briefs as Foreign Secretary) Brexit is not a \"done deal\". But while it is possible Conservative mismanagement could still sink Brexit, it is also possible the same mismanagement could see an accidental no deal Brexit. On that, it is clear Johnson has been looking \"both ways\" claiming to the ERG \"no deal\" group of Tory MPs that he wants no deal, and the 'more moderate' Conservatives and business that he does want a deal. Who knows what he will decide to do now he can afford to ignore either wing of his party.\nWhile a hard Brexit now looks very likely it still isn't guaranteed, and we must do whatever we can to prevent the chance of a no deal Brexit. We'll continue fighting, even if the ball is very much in Johnson's court and we'll need to keep what pressure we can on them to help force the errors that Conservative government ministers have already shown they're likely to make.\nWhat now in Milton Keynes\nWith a strong Council Group\nin Milton Keynes the Liberal Democrats will continue putting pressure on the\nadministration to help the most vulnerable.\nFunding for Local Government\nand the vital services it provides to the most vulnerable is still at\nhistorically low levels following years of funding cuts by Central Government,\ndespite councils raising Council Tax at maximum rates. MK Council funding is\nnow £140 million lower than it was in 2010, and while the government's \"Provisional\nLocal Government Finance Settlement for 2020/21\" suggests there may be some\nrelief from further cuts, the current Conservative promises will do little to help\ncouncils provide services to help the most vulnerable.\nWhile Milton Keynes continues in No Overall Control (no party has a majority) the Liberal Democrat group will continue working cross party to ensure whoever is running MK council does so as well as possible, in the interests of residents of MK now and into the future. Part of that must be ensuring there continues to be a balanced budget spent responsibly so that Milton Keynes doesn't go bankrupt like Northamtonshire County Council which had been run by the Conservatives for decades. In addition, we will continue doing everything we can to help protect the environment - during the period Lib Dems ran MK council 2002 - 2011 there was investment in recycling, a move to renewable only electricity suppliers, increases in bus use, improvements in building standards in MK. We will locally continue to fight for MK to be at the leading edge of fighting against the climate emergency, as the Liberal Democrats will continue to nationally.\nThe next elections in Milton Keynes for the MK Council are in May 2020 where our local champions will be fighting to keep our seats and hopefully gain a stronger voice to fight for residents in Milton Keynes. Across much of Milton Keynes people receive the a regular Focus news letter letting them know what their local Lib Dems are up to. If you would like to join us the link is below, or you can get involved and campaign with us!\nIn Milton Keynes and elsewhere Liberal Democrats will continue fighting to protect the most vulnerable, and for us to leave our country and planet in a better condition for future generations.\nYou can join us online by following this link.",

The decision is being implemented too quickly, putting pressure on charities and organisations that support our communities.

Every vote will matter - so Iain Stewart's decision could have a huge impact on the millions of people around the world that need our help.\n\"The Liberal Democrats have supported international development spending for over sixty years and enshrined the 0.7% target into law in 2015. It is the right thing to do, both for the UK, and those who need our help. On 7th June, Iain Stewart must vote to reinstate the 0.7% target.\"\nLiberal Democrat Foreign Affairs and International Development Spokesperson Layla Moran MP said:\n\"The Conservative Government's decision to cut development spending has done extraordinary damage to Britain's reputation with our allies and partners from across the globe. Now is the time for leadership - but instead, the Conservatives want Britain to hide from its responsibilities during a global pandemic.\n\"Every Conservative MP stood on a manifesto commitment to the 0.7% target. If they vote to cut the development budget next week, they will be breaking a promise to their constituents and to the world's poorest.\n\"Liberal Democrats will vote to reinstate the 0.7% target, which we enshrined in law.

Pupils with special educational needs who are also eligible for Free School Meals would be provided with triple vouchers worth £600 a year.\nThe ambitious plans were featured last week on BBC One and ITV as part of the Liberal Democrats' Party Political Broadcast.

Unfortunately the local Conservatives have a short term view which risks MK's future, with the Tory run Northamptonshire County Council being an example of what could happen under them.\nThe WRP, an Example of Lib Dem Success for MK!\nUnder the Liberal Democrat run council in MK (2002 - 2011) an example of our party having ambitious plans for MK was the 2007 \"Milton Keynes Waste Development Plan Document 2007 - 2026\", which included plans for the Waste Recovery Park in Old Wolverton. To see the documents go here: https://www.milton-keynes.gov.uk/planning-and-building/planning-policy/waste-development-plan-document\nThe plans started in 2007 which led to the completion of the Milton Keynes Waste Recovery Park in 2018 show that the Liberal Democrats are forward looking and ambitious. Black sack waste is seperated, some going for recycling or reuse, and much of the rest is used to create energy. While other councils use 'incineration', Liberal Democrats refused to increase emissions in MK, so pushed for another method which would release energy while not polluting the environment. After this very little waste from MK needs to be buried in landfill.\nAnother sign of the Liberal Democrat ambition for MK is that the plant was planned large enough so neighboring councils could pay MK to dispose of some of their waste in a more environmentally friendly way, with 'profit' being made to protect services in Milton Keynes, while still being cheaper for those councils than burying their waste in landfill!\nMoney saved for the MK council tax payer, while also helping the environment in MK and more widely - a win win for MK by the MK Lib Dems!\nConservative Failure\nWhile some assume the Conservatives are good at running things, their record in neighbouring MK show this isn't the case.\nA telling example of Conservative failure is the bankruptcy of Northamptonshire County council in 2018, a council that had been run by the Conservatives for decades. There are many things which contributed to the section 114 notice once the size of the their overspend was clear, but it is noteworthy that the Conservative council spent £53m on council offices. See more here: https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/feb/11/northamptonshire-county-council-effective-bankruptcy-tories-cuts\nAfter the bankruptcy of Northamptonshire following a £53m spend on offices there by their party, MK Conservatives then have the cheek to attack MK Council for spending £11m on council offices which will help save money for MK in the long run! The investment in MK was in part to increase the number of staff who could work in the Civic Offices, so other offices could be vacated, which will create savings for the council!

However their lack of judgement has been shown as these MK Council reserves have been vital during the pandemic, allowing MK Council to do extra to support care homes in MK when there were PPE shortages, while having fewer concerns about going bankrupt like some Conservative councils!\nLib Dem Success vs Tory Failure\nThe Liberal Democrats have a record of success in MK, fighting for the long term future, from strategic investments over a decade ago which are now helping our area, to defending a balanced budget. The Conservatives however have no real ambition, shown by a key line of attack in this election being on an investment which will save money in MK in the long run, while in 2018 and 2019 demanding that essential reserves be used for their election promises, reserves which have been vital during the pandemic.\nThis election, vote for your local Liberal Democrat candidate to elect someone who will fight for the future of MK!",

House of Commons Library research has detailed the impact of the tax rises, and it is estimated that the average micro-business employing up to nine people will pay more than £1,000 extra a year as a result of the tax hike.\nIn Milton Keynes, small businesses face an extra £9.8m national insurance rise per year once the tax hikes come into place next year.\nAhead of the budget, the Liberal Democrats are calling for small businesses to be offered a lifeline by slashing their employer's national insurance contributions instead of raising them.\nUnder the party's proposals, the Employment Allowance would be quadrupled from £4,000 to £16,000 for at least two years, meaning taxes on small businesses would be slashed by £5.5 billion across the country next year.\nCouncillor Robin Bradburn, Liberal Democrat Group Leader on Milton Keynes Council, said:\n\"The Government's broken manifesto promise will create a £9.8 million tax bombshell for small businesses in our local community.\n\"Small businesses have been hit hard by the pandemic and our high streets have been struggling for years. The last thing businesses in Milton Keynes need right now are damaging tax rises.\n\"Milton Keynes' Liberal Democrats are calling for a tax cut for local entrepreneurs and business owners, to help them create jobs and drive our economic recovery.\"\nChristine Jardine MP, Liberal Democrat spokesperson for the Treasury, commented on the findings:\n\"We have already lost far too many treasured shops from our high streets, and too many businesses are drowning in tax rises and red tape.\n\"Rishi Sunak must give small businesses the chance to grow again instead of clobbering them with a crippling tax rise.\n\"The Chancellor is out of touch with small businesses and if he truly cared about their survival, he would cancel this tax hike immediately.\"",

In will be the same charge regardless as to whether you have a 140 litre or a 240 litre bin.\nLiberal Democrat Group Leader, Cllr Douglas McCall, who introduced the green bins when Cabinet Member for the Environment when the Lib Dems ran the Council attended the Cabinet meeting to speak against the proposal.\nHe expressed his concerns that the proposals would:\n1. Decrease recycling rates.\n2. Increase in fly tipping.\n3. Increase the amount of food and garden waste in black sacks.\n4. Increase the tonnage of black sacks to the Waste Recovery Plant which will mean less capacity to use to charge other authorities.\n5. Concern at what will happen to all the unused green bins. (The Council does not plan to collect them).\n6. The garden waste vehicles will still have to cover the same number of roads, but will be collecting less. How will this impact the contract costs?\n7. The changes don't start making money until year 3, but if the assumptions are wrong it could be year 4 or even year 5.\nLabour decided to press on with their proposals saying that if they didn't there would be a £400,000 whole in their budget due to Conservative Government funding cuts.\nCllr McCall also expressed his concern about the proposals on those on low incomes and asked the Cabinet to look at bringing in a 50% discount for those on prescribed benefits. The Cabinet agreed to look at doing this.\nA 23 litre Food Waste bin will be offered to all residents free of charge if they do not wish to pay to continue the garden waste service.",

This is despite a Conservatives manifesto commitment to keep the triple lock in place until 2024, and comes just weeks after Boris Johnson led his Conservative MPs to vote for a promise breaking tax hike on National Insurance. The Liberal Democrats have warned that the Conservatives are \"turning their back on local elderly residents,\" many of whom are living in poverty.\nThe figures, based on analysis by the House of Commons Library commissioned by the Liberal Democrats, show that 13.6% of people in Milton Keynes North, and 12.9% in Milton Keynes South, will be hit by the government's broken promise. They also show that 2,002 pensioners in Milton Keynes North, and 2,248 in Milton Keynes South, are benefiting from state Pension Credit, which is given to the poorest pensioners.\nThe Liberal Democrats tabled an amendment in Parliament to the Social Security Bill that called for additional support to address the impact of the pandemic on the two million pensioners currently living in poverty and making the uplift to Universal Credit permanent. Labour abstained on the vote, making the Liberal Democrats the only major UK-wide party to stand up for pensioners and oppose the government's broken promise to them.\nCommenting, Councillor Robin Bradburn, Leader of the Liberal Democrat Group on Milton Keynes Council, said:\n\"This is yet another broken promise from the Conservatives that will hit pensioners in Milton Keynes hard in the pocket.\"\nThe government is turning its back on local elderly residents, who risk no longer being able to heat their homes this winter as energy costs spiral.\"\nOur pensioners deserve a fair deal. The triple lock was a cast iron guarantee that vulnerable elderly people were relying on and the Conservatives have failed them.\"\nLiberal Democrats are demanding that the government supports the many pensioners in our area living in poverty and ensure that we don't return to the days of the 75p rise to the state pension.\"",
