For the £3 cost per person, people can enjoy tea and coffee, fantastic cakes, and most importantly, friendship and relaxed conversations, as well as being able to get advice and support from the charities supporting the project.\nEdward said: “It was great to join Raj and the team, who have created not just a cafe, but as they put it, a haven for heartfelt moments, which helps create memories in a warm, friendly space, where people come together and build friendships - and all with a nice cuppa and some cake! Although Melton is a very friendly town, that can sometimes conceal hidden loneliness among some people. We are lucky that in Melton we have so many individuals volunteering and so many organisations and initiatives to help support and strengthen the community, and the new Dementia Friendly Cafe is a part of that - huge credit to Raj and the whole team for the fantastic work they do. Please do support this great addition to the support networks for people in our town and nearby villages.\"",

Dementia is an issue I have taken a close interest in, and campaigned on, since before I entered Parliament, and something that impacts more and more people, so it was great to catch up with Dementia UK to discuss their work nationally, but also what more can be done to ensure access to Admiral Nurses as part of my campaign for better support for people with dementia and those who care for them, here in Melton and Syston.\"",

With emerging government plans to improve patient care through initiatives such as a promised National Cancer and Men’s Health strategies, it is more important than ever that the needs of prostate cancer patients are reflected in those strategies.\nThe event marked the launch of the findings of a Health Inequalities Expert Forum held by Bayer earlier this year, in close collaboration with the patient and clinical communities, to identify what more could be done to mitigate these challenges in prostate cancer diagnosis and care. The vision statements they presented focussed on: Accelerating the speed of diagnosis by removing barriers to testing; Empowering men and communities with the information to better understand the condition and advocate for themselves; and Eliminating inequitable geographical and economic barriers to treatment.\nEdward said: \"Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers, with 1 in 8 men estimated to get the disease in their lifetime. We need to continue to work to improve diagnosis, to improve treatments, and to improve outcomes for men with prostate cancer, and Bayer's event in Parliament and its research was a great opportunity to discuss this in more detail.\"",

Edward is once again calling on the Transport Secretary to honour that, and to provide the funding.\nEdward said: \"As Melton's local MP, for me securing the completion of Melton Mowbray's by-pass is a top priority, and that means working to secure the funding to get the southern leg built. As I have previously highlighted, this funding, previously promised, would allow a portion of it to be spent here in Melton, completing this vital local infrastructure project, and I have already campaigned for LCC to prioritise it when the money is received. But I have become increasingly concerned by the silence from the new Government, and the unwillingness of them to commit to honouring the funding pledge. I have once again pressed the Government to do the right thing, honour the funding promise, and let us get on with securing the completion of this much needed by-pass.\"",

Following the boundary changes to constituencies in Leicestershire, a large part of the former Charnwood Seat was joined with the Borough of Melton, and Sileby from the Loughborough Seat, to form the new Melton and Syston constituency.\nBorn in 1977, and originally from Kent, Edward attended his local state grammar school before studying for a history degree at Oriel College, Oxford. Both his parents were teachers, his mother originally from a farming family and his father from an army family.\nAfter university Edward moved to London and spent four years as Political Adviser to the then Shadow Foreign Secretary. Following that, he spent almost a decade working for private sector businesses including Hedra, Mouchel, and Serco, in management consultancy and communications roles.\nEdward has always taken an active role in his community, having previously served as a school governor, a non-executive board member of a regeneration and employment charity, on the board of an NHS Trust and as a City Councillor in Westminster.\nSince his election to Parliament in 2015, he has held a number of Ministerial roles, including Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Justice, Minister of State for Health between September 2019 and July 2022, and subsequently HM Paymaster-General & Minister for the Cabinet Office attending Cabinet, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, and between October 2022 and July 2024, Minister of State for Justice. Since the 2024 General Election and change of Government, Edward has served as Shadow Lord Chancellor and Shadow Secretary of State for Justice.\nEdward lives locally in the heart of the Melton and Syston constituency, & in London, with his wife Laetitia, and in their free time they enjoy gardening, cooking, and watching cricket, rugby, & horse racing.\nEdward said: “I care passionately about our local area, its towns and villages, its public services, character, environment, and its people - that’s because my wife and I live locally in the Melton and Syston constituency, so this is our community, and these are public services we use, just like you. They matter to us.\nSince I was first elected to Parliament in 2015 I have achieved much for the community I served, but there’s still much I want to deliver for our area, so it’s a huge privilege to have been re-elected to Parliament as the MP for Melton and Syston, and I look forward to repaying the trust that has been placed in me by local people, and will work hard to serve the whole community.”",

While many employers already do the right thing and voluntarily give employees in this dreadful situation paid leave, sadly some do not do so, and this Bill, if enacted, would put this new entitlement in to law.\nSpeaking in the House of Commons, Edward said: \"..... the circumstances that this Bill addresses must be every person’s worst nightmare. We have heard, rightly, that many employers do a fantastic and compassionate job in such circumstances—we should pay tribute to them—but we have also heard, sadly, that there are some who do not. We heard an example this morning, I think from my hon. Friend the Member for Colchester, that to my mind was inexcusable. There will be others who, probably unintentionally and through no ill intent, place a burden on people in this situation. This Bill seeks to help to build the sort of society and the sort of compassionate approach that we all wish to see. It provides time and space for bereaved parents not only to make the tragic and necessary arrangements but to grieve and to try to begin coming to terms with what has happened.......I hope it is not only a hugely important step in its own right but part of broader progress on the issue and on what we do to support people in such circumstances.......The Bill strikes the right balance between employers and employees. It reflects the compassion and the sort of society that all of us in this Chamber and in this country, regardless of the political disagreements we may have, would wish to see. The Bill’s time has come, and I am proud to support it wholeheartedly, as I am sure are all other hon. Members.\"",
