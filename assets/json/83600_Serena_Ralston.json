However, the footprint for the station, as identified in a 2014 consultant’s report commissioned by one part of the council (2), is on land that is currently being brought to market for new housing (Alderman Moores, Former Allotments) by another part of the council. (3)\nGlenn Vowles, Green Party candidate for Bedminster said: “Enquiries made by the Greens have revealed that the team bringing the land to market have received no instructions to reserve space for the station, and were, in fact, unaware that it had even been proposed as a potential site for a new Ashton Gate station. Their only instructions on public transport provision is in regard to the Ashton Vale metrobus stop. This is a shambolic state of affairs!”\nWill Quick, who is also standing for the Green Party in Bedminster, added “We are calling for the site to be withdrawn from the council’s Housing Land Prospectus – at least until the promised Ashton Gate Station business case has been completed. We are also asking for “passive provision” for the station to be included in any potential planning proposals for the land and that any development be expected to make some contribution towards the delivery of a future station, a station that will help ease traffic congestion and reduce air pollution.”\nTony Dyer, the Green Party candidate for Mayor of Bristol said “I am utterly astonished that the council’s left hand does not appear to know what the right hand is doing. This is particularly surprising given the high profile campaign conducted by the Friends of Ashton Gate Station (4). They have received cross-party support as well as providing multiple submissions to several council meetings. Questions clearly need to be asked about the level of the council’s commitment to a station at Ashton Gate, and why there appears to have been a breakdown in communications within the council. I remain committed to delivering a rail station on this site and support Glenn and Will’s calls for “passive provision” to protect the station’s footprint until we are finally able to deliver a station to serve the local community”\nENDS\nNotes\nAgenda item 5, page 25\nhttps://www2.bristol.gov.uk/committee/2016/ta/agenda/0216_1400_ta000.html\nCH2MHill Bristol New Stations High Level Assessment Study – Ashton Gate\nHousing Land Prospectus, Bristol City Council, September 2015\nFriends of Ashton Gate Station website",

Councillors said that while there were some areas of the budget they did support and they were happy they had contributed some valuable elements to the budget through successful amendments, the budget overall was still not good enough, lacking key action on critical areas and continuing the rollout of cuts to services voted through by Labour in the 2018 budget.\nDuring the budget meeting councillors voted to pass three Green amendments to fund action towards carbon neutrality, local improvements to tackle fly tipping and street flooding, purchase more housing for adults with disabilities and enlarge existing council housing.\nHowever despite these amendments passing Green councillors felt they could still not support the budget overall. The Group Leader Eleanor Combley said that Greens could not support a Labour budget until “they commit to actually taking the decisive steps needed to make a difference in Bristol.”\nCouncillor Combley said:\n“Bristol’s Labour administration had the chance tonight to show leadership and courage in supporting bold actions rather than words – and they blew it.”\n“Despite some positive elements in the budget such as our own amendment to kickstart work on carbon neutrality, Greens couldn’t vote for a budget with no action on clean air, no action on congestion, and no action on transport. On top of this the budget proposed increasing the Mayor’s Office funding and maintaining councillor perks while rolling out millions of pounds in cuts to Adult Social Care and Children and Families services.”\n“On clean air the Labour administration is leaving Bristol to choke, preferring to kick the can down the road rather than taking action. 300 people are dying each year because of toxic air in this city – particularly in some of the most deprived areas of the city – and the administration’s continued dithering on this is a disgrace. On tackling congestion and securing better buses for the city, Labour would rather talk about improvements than make them happen, backing away from taking the bold action that’s really needed to transform the transport system in this city – an important step in achieving carbon neutrality.”\n“As usual I expect Labour will attack us for not voting for various items in their budget. As they well know, we are only able to vote for the budget as a whole not for individual items – such as our successful amendment – and unfortunately despite these positive elements this budget as a whole just isn’t good enough. Actions speak louder than words, and while Labour are happy to talk about the issues affecting Bristol, they won’t have our backing until they commit to actually taking the decisive steps needed to make a difference in Bristol.”",

The motion, proposed by Green councillor Fi Hance and seconded by Labour councillor Ruth Pickersgill, calls on Bristol’s Mayor to endorse the ‘These Walls Must Fall’ Campaign (1), lobby the UK government, and work with local MPs and other councils to push for changes in immigration law and alternatives to detention.(2)\nImmigration detention recently hit headlines in Bristol when Kenneth Macharia, a gay rugby player for local team Bristol Bisons, was detained and threatened with deportation. (3) Close to 100,000 people have signed a petition against Kenneth’s deportation to Kenya, where he would be persecuted because of his sexuality. (4)\nCurrently in the UK approximately 30,000 people are detained in immigration detention every year, having committed no criminal offence, but for lacking the correct immigration papers or pending administration of their case. Detention is at centres in prison-like conditions, with no time limit on how long people might be held – detainees do not know whether they will be held for weeks, months or years. The UK is the only country in Europe to detain people indefinitely in this way, at a cost to the government over £100 million per year. (5)\nGreen Councillor Fi Hance said:\n“As a city of sanctuary, Bristol has for many years been vocal in its support of refugees in the city. It is a source of ongoing shame that even today many thousands of people who have committed no crime are detained, often at short notice for many months at a time. This has a huge financial cost but more importantly is a cruel and indefensible way to treat those in our society who have the least. By passing this motion and throwing its weight behind this great campaign, the Council can play an important role in pressuring national government and politicians, and show that Bristol refuses to be a hostile environment for migrants or asylum seekers.”\nDavid Ion from the These Walls Must Fall campaign in Bristol said:\n“These Walls Must Fall Motions have now been passed in cities across the UK: Manchester, Liverpool, Brighton, Oxford and more. When our core cities come together and say no to immigration detention, Westminster will have to listen. Please join us on our march on Dec 8th at 11.30 in Castle Park if you think it’s time that Bristol joins this list and stands up against immigration detention.”\nLabour Councillor Ruth Pickersgill, who worked with Councillor Hance on the motion, said:\n“These Walls Must Fall’ is a really important national campaign that I hope the Council will support. As part of a wider deliberately hostile environment, this Government has allowed a situation to develop where asylum seekers and migrants can be detained for indefinite periods in prison conditions even when they have committed no crimes.\n“Many people in my ward have come to the UK, expecting to be safe and to have their human rights respected, and find themselves whisked away to a Detention Centre, and more often than not, this trauma has a profound impact on their mental health. People seeking sanctuary should not be locked up like criminals.”\nThe motion is a ‘golden’ motion which means it will be the first to be debated at the Council meeting at City Hall (Tuesday 11 December). These Walls Must Fall is planning a march against immigration detention in Bristol on 8 December, starting from Castle Park at 11:30am.

Mr Dyer – who has campaigned for a station at Ashton Gate to be part of the re-opened line – is dismayed at the adding of a massive £100m to the bill.\nHe said ‘This is the latest in a long line of transport related projects in the Bristol area that have either been the subject of lengthy delays, considerable increases in costs or both. From Metrobus to the Portishead Line via delayed Electrification and the dropping of the Henbury Loop, the Bristol area has become the graveyard of public transport ambitions. This seemingly unending catalogue of failure calls into question the professional competence of those overseeing projects of this nature.’\nMr Dyer added ‘We have already seen with Metrobus how the levelof contribution from local tax payers has increased substantially compared to initial estimates – we now need clarity as to who will bear any additional costs for the extra work identified for the Portishead Line, indeed if such money is actually available at all.’\nSouthville Green councillor Charlie Bolton added;\n‘The ever increasing pressure placed on theroad system due to the lack of a modern, energy efficient and low emissions public transport network can be measured not just in the delays and financial loss due to trafficcongestion but also in the impact on Bristol’s air quality and all those who have seen their health suffer as aresult. This is simply not good enough.’\nIn fact, it is only a couple of days since the cabinet approved proposals for council housing on former allotment land at Ashton Vale which would include the safeguarding of land to provide a station for Ashton Gate. Councillor Bolton added;\n‘ If, as appears to be the case, the Portishead Line will now see a reduction to an hourly service then we need to see the delivery of a station at Ashton Gate as an integrated part of that.’",

Because they said they would back the triggering of article 50 once Theresa May presented a Brexit plan, they find themselves now supporting a hard Brexit. It is astounding that the Labour Party is willing to agree to begin a process that will see the UK leave the single market and fire the starting gun on a race to the bottom on the workers’ rights, consumer protections and freedom of movement that go with it.\n“It is now up to individual Labour MPs to put their constituencies first and defy their leader on triggering article 50. I urge Labour to join the Greens in pressing for assurances that the Conservative government will pursue a plan that protects the UK’s economic interests, safeguards jobs, protects our environment and guarantees we do not enter a race to the bottom on corporate tax rates.\n“Triggering a hard Brexit will be highly divisive and destructive.

Her statement to the committee supported some of the decisions such as the adoption of Greens’ suggestion of a ‘carbon budget’ and the setting up of expert advisory panels. However she said the progress update was “not good enough” given the short time left for humanity to prevent climate collapse, saying “Almost a year after declaring an emergency, I would expect to see a lot more in the pipeline than the above plus plans to update council web pages, develop a comms strategy and provide some training.”\nCouncillor Denyer’s statement listed actions the Council could take immediately at no cost, such as opposing Bristol Airport expansion, and called on committee members to “call for real action from the administration as a matter of urgency”, beginning with the actions already approved by all political parties via a Cross-Party Working Group set up late last year.\nShe ended with a stark reminder: “You all voted to declare a climate emergency – this is what it means.”\nSpeaking outside the meeting, Councillor Denyer said:\n“The update shows just how little progress we’ve made since declaring a Climate Emergency – there’s been lots of setting up of committees and boards, but much less work on the carbon reduction itself. Marvin Rees has been happy to take credit for approving the Climate Emergency but has so far refused to take obvious steps like opposing Bristol Airport expansion or backing divestment from fossil fuels.\n“Since passing the Climate Emergency motion we’ve used up one of the 12 years the IPCC report said we had left to take major action. Let’s not waste any more time when there are projects we know we need to get started on which already have cross-party support. Let’s get started on them now.”\nStatement by Cllr Carla Denyer Item 12: Update on the Mayors Climate Emergency Action Plan\nAs I’m sure you all remember, I moved the Climate Emergency motion at Full Council last November. All parties voted for it, including the Mayor. The motion called on the Mayor to pledge to make Bristol carbon neutral by 2030, taking into account emissions from production and consumption.\nSome of what has happened since has been encouraging. In the administration’s Climate Emergency report, it was proposed to take on one of the Green suggestions: a carbon neutral budget. And expert support will be provided through the Bristol Advisory Committee on Climate Change feeding into the One City Environmental Sustainability Board.\nHowever it is almost a year since we declared a climate emergency, and the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change told us last year that we had only 12 years to take bold action to prevent a catastrophe – more recent scientific estimates say even less. So I must be frank about this progress update on how the Mayor is tackling this emergency – it’s not good enough. Almost a year after declaring an emergency, I would expect to see a lot more in the pipeline than the above plus plans to update council web pages, develop a comms strategy and provide some training.\nWe already know there are things we can get started with right away in Bristol without having to wait for government support. Some of them cost nothing – using our influence to oppose the airport expansion, or support divestment of pension funds from fossil fuels. Some of them are already in progress, like our housing insulation programme, but will need to be radically stepped up to meet our 2030 target. And many of them have cross-party support thanks to the work of the 2030 Cross-Party Working Group. However very few of them can be done overnight, so if we are going to respond to this emergency, we have to get started on them as soon as possible.\nSo I ask all of you, as members of this Scrutiny Committee, to call for real action from the administration as a matter of urgency, starting with the actions already agreed by the Cross Party Working Group. You all voted to declare a climate emergency – this is what it means.\nThank you.",

This protects both existing venues and residents.\n“It introduces a rule for staff training on preventing child sexual exploitation. Staff need to be able to spot the signs and learn how to act to help keep those children safe.\n“It recognises public health impacts like alcohol harm as a public safety consideration.\n“However the removal of CIAs is of great concern to many residents and to the councillors who represent them. We recognise the hard work that went into getting them established, and have made good use of them to help our local communities protect normal sleeping hours or maintain the diversity of the local economy.\n“The change is down to new rules from national government, who have increased the threshold for evidence required to keep them in place. Avon and Somerset Police licensing officers have done a huge amount of work to produce enough evidence for the city centre CIA, which covers the area from Stokes Croft to Queens Square and Clifton Triangle. This will be going out to consultation in the near future so people can have their say on it.\n“When the new licensing policy was voted through at Full Council this month, the Greens supported an amendment that urged rapid action to work with communities to reinstate CIAs where needed. Unfortunately Labour voted it down, but that won’t stop Green councillors working with the communities we represent. The old CIAs were far from perfect. Councillors and communities can work together to develop new CIAs that are more effective and more targeted on local needs.\n“In the meantime, losing your local CIA doesn’t mean a guaranteed green light for new venues. Licensing committees can still consider the cumulative impact of multiple venues on an area, providing that police or residents raise it as an issue in their comments on the application. We have asked for updated training for all members in the light of these changes. All councillors should be aware of the powers we do still have, whether as members of the committee or in supporting our communities.”\nCouncillor Carla Denyer, who has supported residents in Clifton Down with licensing issues, said,\n“Whiteladies Road has hugely benefitted from being designated a Cumulative Impact Area in recent years. It has made it easier for residents, police and councillors to resist the creep towards ever-later closing times for bars in and near residential areas, and prevent new bars and nightclubs where they would cause harm, while still allowing new licensed premises to open where they offer something fresh and new, and where they have a conditions to ensure they are managed well.\n“It sounds like the new licensing policy will still allow us to do these things – I certainly hope so. We also still have the planning system to rely on (new licensed premises need planning and licensing consent). But if it doesn’t work out OK, I will be at the front of the queue to apply for a new CIA, and hope that local residents, businesses and the police will work with me on that.”",

The motion, which passed unanimously, made Bristol the first city in Europe to declare a climate emergency – it has since been followed by over 200 councils in the UK, as well as Parliament itself. However, one year later, Green councillors have warned that Bristol faces a “stark gap” between its current position and the action needed to reach its ambitious 2030 target, citing new evidence released by environmental pressure group Friends of the Earth.\nFriends of the Earth (FoE) have published a new tool called ‘How Climate Friendly is Your Area’ which lets visitors put in their postcode and see how their local council is doing on climate action. The summary for Bristol states that the city is doing “better than most” compared to other local authorities but that all councils need to do much more and “Bristol particularly needs to do much better on improving home insulation and increasing tree cover.”\nBristol scores well on renewable energy generation – it generates 72MW compared to the best comparison which generated 81MW. However FoE note that to achieve carbon neutrality by 2030 Bristol will need to meet tough targets, including more than tripling its tree cover, insulating 11,475 homes per year, and increase cycling uptake to 30% of commuter journeys. According to FoE 8% of commutes in Bristol are by bike – the Council’s current energy efficiency plan is to insulate 1,200 properties per year. (Cabinet April 2018, p188)\nThe report also suggests the Council should cease promoting airport expansion and other ‘high carbon’ infrastructure and divest from fossil fuel companies as soon as possible, issues that Green councillors have challenged the Labour administration on repeatedly. Leader of the Green Councillor Group Eleanor Combley charged the Mayor with “not backing up his words with the action needed” to tackle the climate emergency, citing slow progress on recycling rates and major road building proposals as examples.\nCouncillor Combley said:\n“Friends of the Earth have done a brilliant piece of work which shows us how big a gap we have to close in Bristol if we are going to do our fair share to combat climate change and meet the target we set of going carbon neutral by 2030. I am optimistic that, given the years of work already put in by the council’s energy service, the 81MW target for renewable energy generation should be easy to meet, and exceed. But in other areas we’re faced with a really stark gap between where we are right now and where we’ve got to be.\n“For example we need to increase the proportion of people who travel to work by walking, cycling or public transport from 41% to 70%. This will take a real shift in how we think about transport. Unfortunately we’re not seeing that priority from the Mayor when it comes to Bristol’s key decisions. Developments like the South Bristol link road, an out-of-centre arena (with at least 50% of visitors arriving by car), or a proposal for Cumberland basin that drives a four-lane highway past people’s homes, suggest Marvin Rees is not backing up his words with the action needed to prepare us for a carbon neutral future. Similarly, increasing household waste reuse, recycling and composting from 50% to 70% is simply not going to happen under a Mayor who’s avoided taking bold action to boost our recycling rates.\n“This will not be easy – it lays out the scale of the challenge before us – but not everything Friends of the Earth are calling for is expensive. For example, we’ve repeatedly asked the Mayor to stop promoting new high carbon infrastructure, such as the expansion of Bristol airport, and to support divestment of the Avon pension fund, but there are no signs of him softening his position on either of those in a way that is consistent with declaring a climate emergency. Bristol is doing better than many local authorities in some areas, but if we are really going to show leadership in this climate emergency, we need to see much more and bolder action.”\nBackground\nFind below a summary of Friends of the Earth’s report on Bristol. Sources for FoE figures are in the original report available at https://friendsoftheearth.uk/climate-friendly-communities\n– Housing – according to FoE only 37% of homes in Bristol are well insulated. The city needs to get this figure to 100% by 2030, which means insulating a whopping 11,475 homes per year. At present the council’s energy efficiency plan is to insulate about 1200 homes per each year. (Cabinet April 2018, p188)\n– Transport – just over 40% of people in Bristol commute by public transport, cycling or walking. Friends of the Earth suggest a target of 70%. This could be met by improving public transport – RAC survey suggests that 6 in 10 drivers would shift to public transport if its quality improved. It could also be done by improving cycle infrastructure – currently just 8% of people in Bristol ride bikes to work, but research cited by FoE suggests 30% of commuter journeys in Bristol could be made by bike.\n– Energy – this is one area where Bristol is doing well, as the city generates 72MW of renewable energy, not far behind the leading local authority which generates 81MW.\n– Trees – FoE suggest Bristol sets a target of increasing its tree cover to 20% of the local area. This would mean more than tripling the city’s current tree cover as national forestry data suggests just 6% of the Bristol area is woodland.\n– Waste – FoE say Bristol needs to reuse, recycle and compost 70% of its waste by 2025. Mayor Marvin Rees set a target of 55% by 2020 in his 2016 manifesto although the Council does not seem to be on track to close this gap as the Council’s result last year was just under 45%.\n– Divestment and airport expansion – FoE note that one way for Bristol Council to reduce emissions would be to divest council pensions out of fossil fuel investments and move them instead into green technologies. Greens campaigned for this and proposed a motion to enact it in July this year, which was supported by the Council’s largest staff union UNISON – however Labour and Conservative councillors amended the Green motion in order to prevent action. Greens have also repeatedly called on the Mayor to oppose the expansion of Bristol Airport which plans to more than double in size. However the Mayor has not changed his support for expansion, despite a new report finding that the Airport had overstated the benefits and that there could be “no economic benefit” to the expansion.",

Green councillors were replying to the Mayor’s Climate Emergency report, produced as the response to a Green motion passed in November 2018 which declared a climate emergency and set a target for Bristol to become carbon neutral by 2030.\nAs councillors debated the Mayor’s report, the council chamber was packed with climate activists who had also organised a large demonstration on College Green outside. Carla Denyer, the Green councillor who proposed the Climate Emergency motion in November 2018 (the first of its kind in Europe) previously spoke at Extinction Rebellion events in Bristol on Monday and Tuesday.\nResponding to the climate emergency report, she said: “This is a good first step, but it really doesn’t reflect the urgency of an emergency – there’s little change from business as usual”\n“There are some things to like about the report – for example adopting Green ideas like an annual Carbon budget for the Council, and fitting out council housing with solar panels. And it’s great news that our council is now ahead of schedule in cutting its own emissions – but as this represents just 1% of the city’s total we have to look at ways we can influence emissions across the city.\n“Unfortunately instead of an emergency response this feels in some ways like a ‘plan for a plan’. For example we heard a lot about work that the current and previous administrations have already done, and about boards and committees being set up, but we didn’t hear much about simple, deliverable actions that the council is actually going to carry out to reduce Bristol’s carbon emissions. Surely the point of an emergency is that we have to act fast, and do everything in our power now.\n“There’s work we already know that we’re going to need to get done – e.g. massive improvements to our transport infrastructure to prioritise walking, provide safe segregated cycle routes and create more car-free areas of the city – that have already been agreed cross-party. We can’t afford to wait any longer – let’s get started on this now!”\nGreens also challenged Bristol’s Labour Mayor over his own approach to climate change, calling on him to rethink his position on the expansion of Bristol Airport. Despite declaring a climate emergency Marvin Rees remains a supporter of the expansion of this development, which will support an additional 23,600 flights per year.\nCouncillor Steve Clarke said:\n“There’s an enormous ‘elephant in the room’ in this report… airport expansion is not dealt with at all. I know we don’t have direct control over it but Bristol is still a major stakeholder. How can it be credible that our Mayor is saying there is a climate emergency and yet still enthusiastically support plans for thousands of extra flights?\n“To get an idea of the scale of the problem, the whole of Bristol’s direct carbon emissions are 1.6m tonnes a year; the airport expansion alone will add at least 1/2m tonnes per year to that. That’s almost a tonne of carbon for every person in Bristol. If we accept that we need to take urgent action to reduce our carbon emissions – which is what the Mayor and every councillor here voted for in November – then we also have to accept that it’s crazy to support moving in the opposite direction. The airport is big enough already.”",

We desperately need international and national governments to put all the conditions in place to enable us to function truly sustainably, for example by encouraging rather than discouraging renewable energy.”\n“In Bristol I am delighted that as a council we have already reached our target of 40% reductions in CO2 emissions by 2020, and done so five years earlier than planned. Across Bristol we still have a long way to go to reduce CO2 emissions, but as a city we are heading in the right direction.

They argued for stronger planning rules on climate change – for example policy text making clear commitments to carbon neutrality rather than just aspiration. The Greens also raised concerns about weaker protections for public land in the new plan and called for planning policies against advertising billboards and over-concentration of student housing in small areas of the city.\nCouncillor Martin Fodor helped draft the plan response. He said:\n“The local plan isn’t very well known about but it’s a really important document that sets the council’s policy for all planning, having a huge influence on the shape of our city – and it is generally only updated about every 10 years, so it must deal with the challenges of future rather than the problems of the past. We’ve recommended some big changes to the council’s draft plan: stronger protections for green spaces, policies to restrict the impact of airbnb lettings on residents, and most importantly the need for much tougher climate action. It will be interesting to see what proposed changes are taken on board.”\nLeader of the green group, Councillor Eleanor Combley said:\n“Last year the council passed our climate emergency motion, with all councillors including the Mayor voting for an ambitious target of Bristol going carbon neutral by 2030. Now we have to follow through by ensuring that reducing emissions is part of our internal policies and decision making across the whole of the council. We need a Green New Deal for Bristol – this could lay the groundwork, or it could be another strategy for business as usual. I hope the council makes the right decision.”\n“As we’ve seen from the passion of the Youth Climate Strikes and the rapid growth of Extinction Rebellion, people are ahead of politicians on these issues. With the local plan we have an opportunity to put tough climate change action right at the heart of the council’s policy – where it has to be if we’re going to recognise the scale and importance of the climate emergency facing us.”\nExamples of other changes proposed by the Green Group include:",
  "https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_/https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_greens-respond-to-government-proposals-to-change-planning-policy/content_78.html": "menu\nThe Bristol Green Party has responded to Government proposals to change planning policy.\nThe new proposals, laid out in a consultation, would mean that Bristol City Council would have to approve developers’ plans to build on brownfield sites, even if they fail to meet standards for decent quality homes. They also remove restrictions on how big a building can be before a developer has to apply for planning permission.\nOther proposals would make it easier for homeowners to extend their homes without seeking planning permission. Former Prime Minister David Cameron proposed a similar policy back in 2008, which was eventually abandoned following a backlash from his own MPs and local councils.\nCllr Carla Denyer, Co-leader of the Green Party of England and Wales, said, “This government has underfunded local governments for over a decade, and now they are further restricting what power they have to refuse poor developments. Defunding and disempowering local governments has clearly only made the housing crisis worse, yet the government is doubling down on this failed strategy.”\n“The public wants affordable housing. Not once in the Government’s new consultation on developing on brownfield sites is the word ‘affordable’ mentioned. Let me be clear: these proposals will do nothing to help solve the housing crisis for the people of Bristol, but will do plenty to allow private property developers to build more unaffordable housing to make more money.”\nCllr Tony Dyer, Bristol Green Shadow Cabinet Member for Housing Delivery and Homes, said; “ I am no longer surprised at this Tory government’s ability to take a good idea and turn it into bad policy. Housing developments must provide homes that people actually want and can afford to live in – that’s the way to ensure these developments are supported by local communities. Removing the need for these homes to meet standards will not win public support nor help solve the housing crisis, as history shows.”\nThe proposals for brownfield development will only come into effect for councils that cannot demonstrate a full five year supply of housing. Cllr Dyer explains that this may end up with unintended consequences.\n“Removing the ability for local planning committees to have any control over brownfield applications if they fall below the 95% housing threshold could, perversely, encourage local authorities to increase development by any means in order to stay above this line. As green field sites are almost always easier to develop on, these would then become the focus for development, rather than the brownfield sites this policy change hopes to promote.\nCllr Dyer recently brought a motion to Bristol City Council calling on them to maximise housing supply from existing buildings.\nHe continued, “In Bristol, between 2022-2023 there were over 5000 empty homes and around 21,000 families on the housing waitlist. My motion last month went some way to offering solutions on how to bring empty homes and buildings back into use to try and help solve this crisis and received cross party support.\n“But there is much more that could be done, and this must be done at a local level to ensure the vitality of our high streets and office employment is not undermined. We want to increase the supply of housing but not at the expense of our retail and commercial sector – and this needs local democratic oversight.\n“The Government should be working with local councils, not against them, to maximise the delivery of affordable housing. This could also include powers to introduce rent controls alongside an end to Right to Buy, and a ban on no-fault evictions.”\nCllr Tony Dyer is the Leader of Bristol City Council\nMore about Tony",

The allegations centre on RBS offering customers help with turning their businesses around but instead deliberately charging high fees so that they would become bankrupt, enabling the bank to pick up their assets on the cheap. The allegations will now be investigated by the Financial Conduct Authority.\nDr Molly Scott Cato said:\n“This bank, which we, the taxpayers of this country, bailed out and own, has been found actively working to destroy small businesses and profit from their demise. It has long been clear that the financial sector in this country is sucking the lifeblood out of our economy, but the fraudulent nature of RBS’s business activity takes us to a new level of revulsion”.\nThe Green Party is calling for the Royal Bank of Scotland to be broken up and turned into a system of local community banks based on the German banking system. Under such a system each local bank could include local business people and others with an understanding of local economic needs on its Board. It would still lend at interest but do so in a way that served its local economy.\nMolly Scott Cato concluded:\n“A system of local community banks has been the engine of the German economy, supporting a thriving small and medium-sized enterprise sector.

Pressure on councils to meet housing targets can mean developments are approved with poor standards or low levels of affordable housing.\nSouthville Councillor Tony Dyer brought a motion calling for a realistic approach to Bristol’s housing target to a Council meeting in November, which passed unanimously with support from all parties. He said “I’m not against Bristol having targets – but they should be backed up by the evidence”.\nThe Green Councillor explained:\n“The government’s 35% uplift to housing targets in Bristol was a poor approach from the start. It led to a target for the city that was never achievable and undermined locally set planning policies. Bristol has thousands of households on the housing waiting list and there is a real need for new, affordable homes. I believe that a clear, evidence-based approach to housing targets is the best way to meet that need, whilst also delivering the mix and standard of housing we need for the future – including measures to address climate change and protect our valued green spaces. The intention to tackle ‘land banking’ from greedy developers is also welcome. So I’m cautiously positive about this news.\nHe added:\n“Nevertheless, until we see the actual concrete details of the policy rather than press reports and interviews, I’ll be reserving judgement. The devil may be in the detail, and frankly it is hard to trust a government which has done so much damage over the last decade.”\nAccording to a letter from Secretary of State Michael Gove, mandatory housing targets will be replaced by centrally determined “advisory” targets which will act as a “starting point”, with councils able to propose building fewer homes if they faced “genuine constraints” or would have to build at a density that would “significantly change the character” of their area. If councils are able to demonstrate this is the case, they will be allowed to build fewer homes.\nTony Dyer also called for more genuinely affordable and council housing to tackle the cost of living crisis. He said:\n“The Green Party is committed to a ‘just transition’ to a carbon neutral future. In the same way, protecting our green spaces and built heritage must also be done in a way that is just and fair. It’s a difficult balance to strike but we must ensure that a much higher proportion of the homes that are built in Bristol are genuinely affordable rather than simply exacerbating the city’s out of control housing affordability crisis.\n“Following World War One, the government invested in building new council homes that set new standards for housing. The UK need a similar level of commitment from the government today to address our cost of living and homelessness crises. Councils must have the funding to deliver the levels of quality, low carbon council housing that we need.”\nCllr Tony Dyer is the Leader of Bristol City Council\nMore about Tony",

Exeter, Plymouth and Bristol are the top three cities in the UK when it comes to exporting to the EU.\nA new report reveals that the EU is the largest export market for every city in Britain, with the sole exception of Hull, and South West cities top the list [1]. Exeter’s exports were the most dependent on the EU, with 70 per cent going to EU countries, closely followed by Plymouth (68%) and Bristol (66%). Molly Scott Cato, Green MEP for the South West, said:\n“This report reveals the devastating impact leaving the single market would have on three of the largest cities in the South West. The report shows that across the UK our exports to the EU are three times larger than the USA and 11 times larger than China. But for Exeter, Plymouth and Bristol, exiting the single market would be particularly damaging as these three cities export a greater proportion of their exports to the EU than any other cities in the UK.\n“It beggars belief that Theresa May is touring the globe to cobble together dodgy trade deals with right wing bigots and highly dubious regimes while seeking to remove us from the UKs largest export market, by far. But this is not just about trade and exports. The single market has also guaranteed rights at work, protected standards for consumers and safeguarded our environment.\n“This is further evidence of the need for progressive MPs to come together this week and block the triggering of article 50. We need to send the government a clear message that we didn’t vote for this. We cannot allow the government to remove us from the single market and so trigger a downward spiral on jobs, workers’ rights, consumer protections and environmental safeguards.”\nNotes\n[1] http://www.centreforcities.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Cities-Outlook-2017-Web.pdf See page 19.",

A third of these have been linked to air pollution.\nGreen Mayoral candidate Sandy Hore-Ruthven has called on the Mayor to urgently rethink his air quality approach. He said: “The people of Bristol deserve to breathe clean air and this letter makes it clear that proposals put forward are far too little and far too late. When even a Conservative government is telling our council to take swifter action, it is clear Bristol must be failing. Across the country, councils, including Labour ones, are tackling this problem, while in our city Marvin’s timid approach means Bristol is being left behind. It is time to put a proper clean air zone in place and reap the benefits not only of clean air but of active public travel, creating communities that have people at their heart.”\nEarlier this week, Green Councillors called on Bristol residents to respond ‘none of the above’ to the council’s current clean air consultation, which closes on Monday, due to analysis that shows the two options currently out to consultation will not reduce air pollution levels to the legal minimum until as late as 2029 [3].\nGreen Councillor Fi Hance, a former cabinet member, has been campaigning for better air quality in Bristol for many years. She said: “Air pollution hits poorer people hardest, and is linked to over one in ten early deaths in some of the more deprived parts of Bristol. On top of this toxic air harms children’s lung development and health across the whole city. But the Mayor has resisted any restrictions on private vehicles use from day one, fearing that it would make him unpopular. Now his failure to act swiftly is again being called out by the government. We can only conclude he is more concerned with electoral success than the health of our children and people in the most deprived areas of Bristol.”\nNotes\nThe letter, from Therese Coffey MP, Junior Minister for Air Quality in DEFRA, was written to Marvin Rees on 23rdJuly, but published online this week.",

Instead, we need immediate investment in projects that will make a real difference to the people of Bristol and build a city fit for the future.”\n“Effective capital investment should include a free nationwide home retrofit insulation programme, focusing on areas with the worst fuel poverty. Across the country this would cost £45bn over 5 years and could insulate 9 million homes and take at least 2 million homes out of fuel poverty, while creating well over 1000,000 jobs. In Bristol 13% of Bristol households live in fuel poverty – that’s around 25,000 households who would instantly benefit from home a retrofit project that would also stimulate the local economy and create new jobs (2).”\nTony Dyer, Green Party local government spokesperson and parliamentary candidate for Bristol South said:\n“Tomorrow’s Autumn Statement provides a clear opportunity to invest in capital projects that generate an economic, social and environmental return on investment. In Bristol this could include constructing 4,000 energy efficient council homes for social rent (3), investment in flood defences for the Bristol area and much needed investment in transport infrastructure such as stations at Ashley Down and Portway Park and Ride (4).”\nCouncillor Charlie Bolton, Leader of the Green councillor group said:\n“For many of us storm Angus may seem like the last straw in a year that has seen the country vote to leave the EU, the council announce it will be losing a fifth of its staff and the election of Donald Trump in America. But at times like this, it is more important than ever that we focus on the opportunities we have for positive change.

Bristol City Council figures show 13% of Bristol households live in fuel poverty, this equates to roughly 25,000 homes. The cost of implementing energy efficiency measures such as insulation to reduce energy costs is around £5k per home, with a total cost of £125m over five years or £25m per annum. This investment could be funded through Green QE purchasing of general City Council debt.\n3. The construction of 4,000 council homes over five years (800 council owned social rent homes per year) assumes use of council owned land. The average construction cost is £60k per unit plus £5k per unit for energy efficiency measures. The overall cost of construction is £240m and could be funded through Green QE purchasing of the Council’s HRA debt (currently £244m). The cost of energy efficiency measures are an additional £20m funded though Green QE purchasing of general council debt.\n4.

Despite the undoubted success of the scheme, the Coalition Government closed it in 2015, instead providing non-ring-fenced funding to local councils, including Bristol, to cover the period until April 2016.\nHere in Bristol, at a full council on 16th September 2014, a Green Party motion was passed calling upon the Mayor to ring-fence the ILF funding transferred to Bristol City Council. (1)\nSince then, Mayor Ferguson has announced that he will not continue to provide ILF funding, citing a lack of central government funding.\nHowever, following concerted campaigning by Deaf and Disabled People’s Organisations (DPOs),\nand their supporters, the Conservative government have now performed an U-turn and are now extending ILF funding to English councils for another four years.(2)\nIn Bristol this will equate to almost £7m of additional funding over the next four years.(3) If the money is not ring-fenced, there is a danger that the money could be used for purposes other than supporting ILF-users and even be taken out of adult social care altogether.\nGreen group leader, Cllr Ani Stafford-Townsend said “We are calling upon the current Mayor to commit to ring-fencing the additional funding so that it is spent for the purpose intended. Given that the government has now performed this U-turn, we see no reason for Mayor Ferguson not to take this step which is consistent with the spirit of the original Green Party motion.”\nGreen councillor for Ashley, Rob Telford – who proposed the original Green Party motion back in 2014 – said “It is crucial that this funding is ring-fenced in order to deliver high quality personal assistance to disabled residents in Bristol in order that they can live their lives independently. The fact that this money has been at risk is shaming to the government and the actions of disabled and non-disabled people have ensured that the government listens. Of course, the disability community should never have been put in this position in the first place.”\nThe Bristol Disability Equality Forum, who are strictly non-party political, are calling on all Mayoral candidates, of all Parties, to commit to ring-fencing this funding so that it can be used as intended: by Disabled people themselves to live independently as equal citizens.\nIn response, Tony Dyer, the Green Party candidate for Bristol Mayor said “This new U-turn, coupled with the government’s announcement allowing for an Adult Social Care precept, is a clear sign that even the Conservatives (at least at national level, if not locally) are becoming aware of the damage their spending cuts are doing to social care provision. The Greens have long championed the need to ring-fence ILF funding. As Mayoral candidate I am committed to ring-fencing this funding for ILF-users for the next four years, and call on my fellow candidates to make the same commitment.”\nEnds\nNotes:\n(1) http://www.disabilityrightsuk.org/news/2014/september/we-applaud-bristol-councils-ilf-vote\n(2) http://www.disabilitynewsservice.com/government-agrees-four-more-years-of-ilf-transition-cash-for-councils/\n(3) Annex B of the Government’s consultation provides estimates of the levels of ILF funding each local authority will receive.

However, I was horrified to learn that even with this building programme we will still end up with less homes than we started with because of central government legislation, in particular Right to Buy.” she said. The current plans fit within the constraints of the housing revenue account rules on borrowing.\nRadice explained:\n“The Council provides homes at a rent that people on low incomes can actually afford. With a waiting list that has reached up to 14,000 families there is a huge need for homes at a truly affordable rent in our city. Council housing also saves central government money because the rent is lower than that charged by private landlords thus reducing the amount of housing benefit needed to provide families with a roof over their heads’.\nRadice attacked the government’s plans to extend Right to Buy to Housing Association homes;\n“The government’s plan to force Councils to sell off their ‘high value’ houses to subsidise the sale of Housing Association homes is outrageous. It will jeopardise our council house building programme and so result in even fewer homes available for those that so desperately need them.” Evidence has shown that the treasury is taking more than its fair share of money from sale of right-to-buy homes, meaning that replacement has not been happening.*\nThe Assistant Mayor noted RTB is being abolished in Scotland and Wales. “I am appealing to the Mayor to lobby the government to extend the power of abolition to Bristol. When the referendum for a directly elected Mayor was imposed on England’s major cities, the government promised new powers for those cities who voted in favour. Bristol was the only one of the major cities to vote in favour of an elected Mayor, but the government has repeatedly failed to deliver on that promise to Bristol.”\n“Until Bristol is given the powers it needs to provide homes for those who need them, I will resist the government’s ill-conceived proposals to my utmost ability.”\nFurther Information:\n*”Treasury grabs £358m of right to buy receipts”\nhttp://www.insidehousing.co.uk/treasury-grabs-358m-of-right-to-buy-receipts/7007621.article\nFOI request shows that despite government promises of a 1-4-1 replacement for any homes solds after the government increased RTB discounts to £75k in 2012, only £588.3m of the £1.54bn of RTB receipts has been used to fund replacement homes with £358m being hived off by the Treasury.\n“In cities where house prices are high, Right To Buy 2 is nothing less than social cleansing”\nhttp://www.citymetric.com/politics/cities-where-house-prices-are-high-right-buy-2-nothing-less-social-cleansing-1086\nDisccusses policy to fund RTB discounts for housing association properties by selling off most expensive thirds of council homes (15,000 per year).\n“It’s time to call time on Right To Buy”\nhttps://redbrickblog.wordpress.com/2014/03/26/its-time-to-call-time-on-the-right-to-buy/\n“RTB has been a prolonged fire sale in which houses and flats have been sold at an average price of only £20,000.”",

If you are not sure which ward you live in you can check on the council’s ward finder page.”\n“We know from a recent report from UWE that 20mph saves lives, cuts both serious and less serious accidents and saves money. 20mph limits also create a safer environment for cyclists and pedestrians, including children walking to school, the elderly and those with visual disabilities.”\nLeader of the Green group of councillors, Eleanor Combley said:\n“We know that 70% of people support 20mph on our busy streets, and now is the time for everyone to make sure you are not a silent majority. We must send the message loud and clear to the Council that road safety is a priority and our 20mph limits must be protected.”\n“As a road user, whether on foot, by bike or in a car, I find that 20mph has made our roads safer and more comfortable places to be. Interestingly, research by UWE found that 20mph has reduced speeds, but made almost no difference to journey times over a longer distance, because drivers in 30mph limits were spending their time accelerating, braking, and idling in queues and almost never driving at a steady 30mph anyway. For the same reason, the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) have found 20mph is likely to improve air quality.”\n“The high number of deaths on our roads is both unacceptable and avoidable.

Longer term support and additional funding are also crucial though.

Encouraging heroin users off the streets will not only help to save lives, but also improve our communities and save us money.

If she remains prime minister, we could end up walking hand in hand with the world’s greatest environmental polluter and sacrificing the climate at the altar of a dodgy trade deal.\nBut Trump has at least achieved one thing. The outrage over his decision to turn his back on one of the globe’s most important treaties has raised climate change up the political agenda just in time for this week’s general election. With that in mind, it is clear that more Green MPs demanding stronger action on climate change are needed now more than ever.”",

As a diverse, progressive and vibrant city, with many business and economic connections to the EU, we at Bristol Green Party agree with the majority of Bristolians that a vote to Remain was in the best interests of the city at this time; and in the interests of the country as a whole.\nWhile we recognise that there were legitimate arguments for electing to leave the EU, we felt that the Leave campaign was being driven by an agenda based on division and fear tactics. The results of such a campaign, we feared, would be increased division in our communities.\nHowever, the views of the majority of Bristolians were not reflected across the country as a whole, where a narrow overall majority voted to Leave the EU. While we recognise that many of us in Bristol are unhappy about this outcome and the uncertainty it has caused, we must try to pull together.\nSadly, there is some evidence that the referendum campaign tactics have already created unpleasant division in many of our British communities. Apart from the tragic murder of MP Jo Cox, who was working to protect the rights of refugees, across the country reports are coming in that individuals and communities are the targets of hate crime. Immigrants from Eastern Europe as well as existing UK citizens from ethnic minorities have reported disturbing incidents.\nWhile these incidents are relatively few in number, and carried out by a tiny minority, they contribute to the atmosphere of fear and uncertainty that recent events have precipitated.\nIn Bristol, whether we voted to Leave or to Remain, we can’t allow this result to destroy our communities. We can’t allow the people of our city to view each other with fear and suspicion. Now, more than ever, we must act calmly and with care; care of each other, and care of our city.\nWe must show care not only to the huge numbers of people from diverse cultures and backgrounds that make up our city, but to all those who voted to Leave based on a feeling that their interests had been ignored by successive governments. We respect their democratic decision and do not believe that a Leave vote was inevitably a racist vote. Bristol stands for unity, and we would like to ask all Bristolians to stand in solidarity with each other as we move through this challenging time.",

With no written constitution, there was nothing to prevent David Cameron from unleashing the destructive EU referendum with no proper safeguards.\nIf we had a proportional electoral system, the sound opposition being provided by Green MP Caroline Lucas and Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron would be greatly reinforced. And if we had a democratic and effective second chamber, something my colleague Baroness Jenny Jones has been working for through her House of Lords Reform bill, we might expect its members to restrain the worst excesses of post-referendum foolishness.\nCurrently they dare not for fear of incurring their own abolition.

Green MEP, Molly Scott Cato, has teamed up with Labour’s Clare Moody MEP and former Conservative MEP, Julie Girling, to write to the Commission about their concerns[1].\nThey have asked how much the Commission know of Russian influence in the referendum campaign and of the techniques used; whether they consider such interference was an attempt by the Kremlin to attack and destabilise the EU; and whether they will use EU agencies to investigate the allegations.\nMolly Scott Cato said:\n“The EU referendum and the decision to leave the EU has been one of the most divisive our nation has ever experienced. But it is also bridging the political divide. In an unprecedented display of unity, three MEPs in the South West, from across the political spectrum, have united to express our deep concerns over allegations of Kremlin meddling in the EU referendum campaign.\nClare Moody, Labour MEP said:\n“The Electoral Commission’s enquiry shows the evidence is mounting of links between British politicians and the Russian government and we now know there were over 156,000 Russian-based Twitter accounts engaged in a concerted campaign to support the Leave side. It is essential we get some answers about the extent to which this interference influenced the referendum result. That’s why, as MEPs, we are asking the Commission to tell us what they know and to investigate further.”\nMolly Scott Cato believes the allegations of Russian collusion adds weight to the case for people and Parliament having the final say:\n“The idea of a ratification referendum on the final deal agreed between the EU and the UK has long been Green Party policy. However, the allegations of Russian influence cast a long shadow over the Brexit result. It is therefore even more essential that the British public are provided another opportunity to vote to accept the deal negotiated by the government or choose to remain in the EU.”\n[1] Letter to EU Commission: http://mollymep.org.uk/2017/11/28/wq-commission-russia-ref/\nFull list of signatories:\nBrisol’s MEPs: Molly Scott Cato (Green), Julie Girling (former Conservative), Clare Moody (Labour)\nOther MEPs: Catherine Bearder (Lib Dem), Richard Corbett (Labour), Jill Evans (Plaid Cymru), Jean Lambert (Green), Jude Kirton-Darling (Labour), Paul Brannen (Labour)",

The research shows the ‘unmistakable’ relationship between regions economically interdependent with EU markets and a high Leave vote. Conversely, those regions least dependent on EU markets displayed the strongest pro-Remain votes.\nThe study finds that the economy of the South West is particularly dependent on the EU, with Gloucestershire, Wiltshire and North Somerset considered the third most dependent area of the country. Devon, Dorset and Somerset are also in the top ten most dependent areas.\nThe findings ‘fly in the face’ of Leave campaigners who claimed the major beneficiaries of EU membership were ‘metropolitan elites’, says Molly Scott Cato, Bristol’s Green MEP:\n“The South West is one of the regions where a small majority voted to leave the EU but this research also finds it to be a region where economic activity is highly dependent on trade with the rest of Europe.\n“This is the clearest evidence yet that those who are likely to suffer most from our decision to leave the EU will be those who voted for Brexit. The findings fly in the face of Leave campaign myth-making that claimed the major beneficiaries of EU membership were the ‘metropolitan elites’ of London. Nothing could be further from the truth: people voted for Brexit on a false prospectus.\n“This report is a reality check. It shows unequivocally that our membership of the EU has actually benefitted the South West region, strengthening local economies and helping to rebalance our economy away from the South East.\n“The consensus that Brexit was a vote by those left behind by globalisation is confirmed, but if the Prime Minister is really interested in helping such people she would be advised to ensure that we remain in the single market and maintain the closest possible links with our EU neighbours”.\nThe new findings follow a recent report which found Exeter, Bristol and Plymouth topped the list of cities exporting to the EU. This latest report also warns against optimistic speculation that new trade deals with other non-EU countries and a new ‘bespoke’ deal with the EU will foster growth in all UK regions. The report concludes that there is almost no evidence to support this argument and that the findings ‘appear to point in the opposite direction’.\nNotes\n[1] The mismatch between local voting and the local economic consequences of Brexit",

But devolution has to be more than just a term – it has to be about enabling local communities to have a real say over the decisions that affect them. True devolution should be transparent, democratic and accountable. So far, the devolution negotiations have been undertaken behind closed doors with no real input from locally elected councillors or consultation with local people.”\nThe deal will create a combined authority of Bristol, Bath and North-East Somerset, South Gloucestershire and North Somerset headed by a Metro Mayor.\nGreen Councillor Rob Telford said:\n“As always the devil is in the detail. While we wholeheartedly support more cooperation between local authorities on transport and housing, we are concerned about introducing a new Metro Mayor with sweeping powers to make decisions across the West of England. We are not clear that elected councillors will have the power needed to hold the Metro Mayor to account if they feel a decision is not in Bristol’s best interest. Even Bristol’s Mayor can be overturned if the other three local authorities unite to push a decision through. “\nThe deal will offer the West of England the opportunity to borrow £1 billion for local infrastructure projects. If the projects lead to economic growth, the profits will be used to pay back the money borrowed.\nGreen councillor, Stephen Clarke said:\n“The deal is being presented as free cash for Bristol, but it is actually the opportunity to borrow. While Greens agree that funding for transport and housing infrastructure is crucial, we are worried about economic growth becoming the sole driver and measure of success for new infrastructure projects. Just because an economy grows, it doesn’t mean everyone benefits. Tackling poverty, inequality and environmental concerns should be central to any new infrastructure developments.”\n“If it is done right, devolution could build a truly thriving regional identity across the West of England, with investment in transport and housing that benefits all of us. A good governance structure could breathe life into local democracy, enabling people to have a real say in decision making.”\n“But a rushed-through, secretive deal will see further political disillusionment. At this rate, we risk developing infrastructure plans that fail to see beyond economic growth, presided over by a Metro Mayor with little transparency or accountability.”",

Responding to the reports, leader of the Green Group Councillor Eleanor Combley said:\n“What was first touted as a simple ‘value for money’ review is beginning to look like a very expensive piece of political justification for a decision it seems the Mayor has already taken in private, regardless of his manifesto promise and of the views of the public, his councillors, or even fellow Labour politicians. The problem with these reports is that we are being asked to compare reality with fiction. On the one hand we have an actual arena on which millions of pounds of actual money has been spent and actual building work had already begun which would bring huge economic benefits to the disadvantaged areas of Central and South Bristol in terms of new jobs and opportunities. On the other we have a highly optimistic pencil sketch, in which the private sector steps forward and provides exactly what the Mayor wants on the Arena Island site, at little or no cost to the public purse, while a foreign corporation builds and owns an arena to the north of Bristol. That report does at least acknowledge that this would suck life from the city centre, and would require millions from the public purse for transport infrastructure, but other than that there is very little that can be said with certainty – at this point it is little more than vague conjecture.\n“All of this is dependent on so many other factors – proper transport provision, planning tests and permissions, funding partners, an operator and builder – that we don’t even know if it is possible at this stage. Any discussions that have taken place have done so behind closed doors, so is there anything to stop YTL taking many millions of pounds of public money for infrastructure and then discovering that the arena project isn’t viable after all? It is pie in the sky. No wonder the Mayor decided to release these in the middle of the night before a big Brexit vote.\n“It would be great to see a focus on simple bricks-and-mortar delivery and public, transparent decision making from our Mayor rather than these pipedreams assembled in smoke-filled rooms, which have delivered nothing for the people of Bristol but plenty of revenue for consultants and corporations.”\nBackground:\nCouncil votes for Temple Meads arena location after Green motion\nBristol Arena marred by back-room deals and ‘revolving door’ of staff, say councillors\nBristol Arena decision delayed AGAIN, as council finally admits Filton hangar is a possible site\nContact:\nCouncillor Eleanor Combley\nCllr.Eleanor.Combley@bristol.gov.uk\n07584 370427 / 0117 3526155",

Green councillors welcomed the news and praised young people for putting the Climate Emergency on the agenda.\nThe previous climate strike in Bristol on February 15 saw between one and two thousand young people protesting outside City Hall on College Green. Organisers say that the numbers are expected to be even higher this time as it is part of a global strike with more than 80 countries participating. The strike itself – the Global Youth Strike 4 Climate – is a protest over UK government inaction on climate change. The organisation behind this in the UK (UK Student Climate Network (1)) have four further demands that include lowering the voting age to 16, declaring a national climate emergency, reforming the national curriculum to making climate change a priority and the government committing to communicating the crisis to the general public.\nKatie Hodgetts, a student and one of the organisers, said:\n“Climate change has always been an incredibly important issue for me. But for my entire life I have watched past and present governments act in a way that jeopardises my right to a healthy and fair future. How can we be so aware of the crisis we face, yet fracking is still being pushed? We are still giving millions in oil & gas ‘development aid’ each year? We aren’t passing enough legislation to meet our climate commitments?\n“These hypocrisies have led young people to take matters into their own hands. It is us, the young people, who will have our lives altered by the climate breakdown, yet decisions are being taken without us in mind. This gross transgression of democracy has galvanised young people in to action. We are fearful of our futures, and we are fearful of leaving it in the hands of individuals who prioritise profit and fossil fuels over people and justice. So we are joining over 80 countries in demanding change on March 15th. We hope for the support of parents, teachers and politicians alike. Because time is running out.”\nGreen councillor and former Cabinet Member Fi Hance welcomed the news, saying:\n“Political leaders need to take notice of the huge numbers of passionate young people who are protesting. We could all learn a lesson in urgency from these students. The fact of the matter is business – and politics – as usual just cannot continue if we are to avoid disaster on a global scale.

Bristol’s Labour administration has missed two deadlines already to produce plans to deal with the city’s toxic air, and could face legal action from the government.\nQuestions by the ‘Bristol Clean Air Alliance’ asked for public health research of the options explored by the council but were told that the relevant evidence would not be available until December 2019. Green councillors asked for key reports produced by the council which were not released for councillors to view and challenged the administration for bringing forward important plans without evidence that they would work in improving air quality.\nGreen Councillor for Redland Fi Hance has been following the Council’s air quality plans since her time as a Green Cabinet member. Responding to the plans brought to cabinet yesterday, she branded the repeated delays and un-evidenced proposals by the Labour administration “shameful”.\nCouncillor Hance said:\n“Imagine if the Council had the opportunity to prevent hundreds of early deaths every year in Bristol – to prevent children developing lifelong breathing problems and asthma, and cut rates of lung cancer, strokes and heart disease, improving life expectancy and health across the whole of the city. Not only that – at the same time we could reduce traffic, improve cycling and walking and raise money to transform transport, improving quality of life for everyone in Bristol. By putting together an ambitious, evidence based plan we also could earn tens of millions of pounds in funding to support the work and reduce the impact of changes on the poorest.\n“It’s depressing to realise that Bristol has had this opportunity for almost two years now – and so far, this administration has blown it.\n“People in Bristol have every right to be angry that after two years waiting and almost a million pounds spent, the Mayor has come up with a rag bag of uncosted, evidence-free suggestions that we don’t even know will improve air quality. For all his protestations that he is protecting the poor with his refusal to limit polluting cars in the city, he knows full well that many of the poorest people in the city – many of whom in wards like Lawrence Hill don’t own cars – have been most affected by his inaction. This is shameful.”\n– Image is of Cllr Hance (3rd from right) representing Bristol at the COP23 Climate Summit in Bonn, 2017.",

We need many thousands of low carbon jobs here in Bristol to transform our houses so they are warmer and more energy efficient, revolutionise our transport systems and roll out renewable energy.

Installing a gas power station in the centre of St Werburghs is not the right way to address our energy shortages.”\n“The next step is for us as a city to also give this message to the government. What we need is a long term approach to energy that prioritises renewables, energy efficiency and investment in grid upgrade and energy storage.”\nRob Telford, councillor for Ashley ward added:\n“I am hopeful that the council’s new Statement of Community Involvement will stop speculative developers like UKPR from refusing to consult with the communities in which they seek to place their developments. With over 700 objections, the community of St Werburghs spoke loudly and clearly that they do not want additional non-renewable power generation in their community.

By an overwhelming majority (87-1), MEPs voted for a revision of the Anti-Money Laundering Directive, which will tighten rules on trusts and transparency. Molly Scott Cato MEP is a member of the Economics Committee in the European Parliament. She said:\n“There is growing outrage about the way wealthy people are able to offshore their money so they can avoid paying tax. A strengthened anti-money laundering law – which requires transparency from financial and legal companies in the management of the assets of the wealthy – will help to tackle this immoral and often illegal activity.\nThere was strong support for a Green proposal for a public register of property ownership to show who is the beneficial owner of land and property. Dr Scott Cato said:\n“This is a significant win for the Greens. In London and elsewhere dirty money is laundered through the purchase of property so it is crucial to have public information on who benefits from its ownership.”\nMolly Scott Cato has challenged the UK government to declare their support for the measures as the country prepares to leave the EU. She said:\n“We have already seen that Amber Rudd was involved in offshore trusts in the Bahamas and now we have had the Chancellor and Prime Minister suggesting the UK will take on even more of the character of a tax haven after Brexit.\n“As a British MEP I will be keeping my eye on the UK government in the European Council, where the decision will be taken by qualified majority so they will not have a veto.”\n“But the government needs to realise that refusing to follow these strengthened EU laws on financial transparency could increase the destructive impact of Brexit on The City. This is because in order to register trusts in EU member states, or for clients in those countries, British legal and financial firms will still need to stick to these laws.”\nDr Scott Cato concluded:\n“Today’s votes show that it is Greens that are leading on key agendas concerned with social justice and economic accountability.”",

This follows months of work by Green councillors who passed a successful Full Council motion calling for action on clean air in November 2016.\nLatest Bristol Council data shows sites across the city centre exceeding the legal limit for Nitrogen Dioxide levels, with some experiencing twice the legal limit.\nStatistics in the report also show that the bulk of the city centre’s air pollution is due to diesel engines, with diesel cars responsible for 40% of Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) emissions and diesel cars and LGVs accounting for nearly two thirds of these emissions in central Bristol.\nGreen Councillor Jerome Thomas said: “This research is very helpful in identifying the sources of air pollution in central Bristol. The statistics highlighting the air pollution caused by diesel cars is a particular cause for concern and suggests that any plan to secure breathable air for Bristolians must include action on these polluting vehicles.”\nThe report released for next week’s Cabinet session notes that in terms of the “general trend of Nitrogen Dioxide pollution in the city we can see no significant improvement in pollution levels, which remain above the legal limit values.” Under recent government guidance Bristol has a legal duty to develop an Air Quality Action Plan to bring Nitrogen Dioxide levels below legal limits and reduce the public health impact of air pollution.\nCouncil research indicates that diesel cars and LGVs combined contribute nearly two thirds of Nitrogen Oxides emissions in the city centre.\nAlong with particulate matter, Nitrogen Dioxide is a major component of air pollution. The health impacts of air pollution include poor lung development and asthma among children, and deaths from cardiac and respiratory causes among adults.

On this occasion strikers will be joined by unions and staff from local organisations like Bristol University as part of an international day of climate action. At a council meeting on Tuesday 10th September Carla Denyer, the Green Party councillor who initiated Bristol City Council’s declaration of a Climate Emergency, asked Mayor Marvin Rees if he would support Council workers taking time off to join the strike.\nReferring to the University College Union (UCU) campaign for a 30 minute workday stoppage to join the climate strike, and Bristol University’s support for the action, Councillor Denyer asked: “Will the Mayor join this call and make a similar pledge to support Bristol City Council workers taking time off on 20 September to join the Climate Strike?”\nIn response the Mayor refused, stating “If staff want to take the time out they would need to take leave and as always this would be with managers approval and service needs being paramount” and attacked Cllr Denyer for raising the issue. (Full response in notes below)\nCarla said:\n“I’m very disappointed by the hostile answer I received from the Mayor when I asked him to support the Global Climate Strike. The UCU and the Trades Union Congress (TUC) have now backed the strike, as has Bristol University, so it is remarkable that a Labour mayor would not only refuse to support striking workers, but also be so rude about doing so. It is clear that his ears are completely closed to any suggestions from Green Party politicians, even on issues where we thought there would be common ground. I can only hope now that lobbying from the UCU and TUC might persuade him to change his mind.”\nThe UCU passed a motion at the TUC Congress in Brighton on 11 September calling on all TUC unions to take part in campaign action on the day of the Climate Strike and the leaders of all opposition parties, including Jeremy Corbyn, have also backed the strike.\nBristol UCU tweeted in support of Councillor Denyer saying it was “Proud of @BristolUni’s progressive decision to support 30-min solidarity stoppage on 20th Sept” and that Mayor Marvin Rees “would do well to follow suit. And recognize difference between a short solidarity stoppage to demonstrate #UnitedforClimate and a disruptive, terms + conditions strike.”\nYouth strike organisers attended the meeting to ask their own question of the Mayor but their question was not heard because of time constraints. After the meeting one of the youth strike organisers, Lily, 17, said:\n“We’re very disappointed not to have had the chance to ask our question at the Full Council meeting. We hope that Marvin will still consider our request for him to strike with us. We’re also saddened that Bristol is no longer leading the way in climate action. We hope that Bristol City Council will reconsider its decision not to support workers who wish to strike on the 20th of September. City of York, Brighton & Hove and Greater Manchester councils have all publicly shown their support for what will be the largest ever climate mobilisation, and we would love to say the same about our own local authority. With our future at stake we feel that the time for adversarial politics is over, and pettiness (on all sides) benefits no one.”\nAt the same Council meeting, Labour councillors moved a ‘Green New Deal’ motion which was criticised for not containing any concrete actions. Greens proposed an amendment to add commitments including divesting from fossil fuels and investing in better cycling and walking infrastructure, but it was voted down by Conservative and Labour councillors.\nThe Climate Strike will start with a demo at 11am on 20th September at College Green, with further details released closer to the date. There will also be a ‘Critical Mass’ style bike demo taking place at 6pm on 20 September organised in part by Extinction Rebellion.\nNotes:\nMember Forum Question – Councillor Carla Denyer – Tuesday September 10\nSubject: Earth Strike\nUCU has stated its support for a 30-minute workday solidarity stoppage to coincide with the global youth-led student strike on the 20th September, and are calling on other unions, universities, politicians and community groups to join them. In early August Bristol University announced that it will support its staff to take part.\nWill the Mayor join this call and make a similar pledge to support Bristol City Council workers taking time off on 20 September to join the Climate Strike?\nREPLY:\nI’ve been clear in my support of the climate emergency – I’m proud of the work we’re doing on this to act and drive carbon neutrality in Bristol.\nIf staff want to take the time out they would need to take leave and as always this would be with managers approval and service needs being paramount.\nTrade Unions in Bristol have a proud history of industrial action to defend and promote worker’s rights. A strike comes with risks and many trade unions members will be able to explain to you the hardship of losing pay to defend terms and conditions.\nIt would be great if we could see the councillor for Clifton Down actually involving herself in solutions rather than continuously failing to understand the real challenge of actually acting now to tackle the climate emergency. She also has been noticeable in her absence when we have been dealing with social care, children in care, house building, hunger programmes, poverty and immediate challenges that people in Bristol face every day.",

Over 30,000 social rented homes have been lost to Right to Buy since 2010, with too few replacements (4).\nThe Green Party will build 500,000 social rented homes by gradually increasing the social housing budget from £1.5bn pa to £6bn pa by 2017 (5). We will pay for this by reforming landlord tax allowances to incentivise good practice rather than profits, starting by scrapping buy-to-let mortgage interest relief. We will also remove the borrowing caps from local councils.\nNatalie Bennett, Green Party Leader, said:\n“We need to move away from regarding houses as primarily financial assets and go back to regarding them as homes. This policy is an important step in that direction.\n“Landlords have been receiving massive public subsidies through tax breaks and housing benefits, and this is contributing to the rising, unsustainable level of inequality in our society.\n“They do not deliver enough of social and economic benefit to the rest of society to justify their favourable tax treatment: it isn’t in the interests of our common good to continue this bias towards the wealthy at the cost of those struggling to survive with high rents and often low-quality housing.”\nCaroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, said:\n“In my Brighton constituency the cost of buying a home is 44% higher than the average. That’s pushing my constituents into debt, into poor quality rented housing, and into homelessness.

After 40 years of sales, demolitions and budget cuts, the Green Party will put social housing back at the heart of housing policy.”\nThe Green Party’s Manifesto, due to be launched in late March, will include a full fleet of policies designed to address the housing crisis, including policies to bring empty homes back into use (6), a better deal for private tenants, ending Right To Buy, and action on rent levels.\nFor more information please contact press@greenparty.org.uk\nNotes:\n1. https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/improving-the-rented-housing-sector–2\n3.

  "https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_/https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_bristol-airport-carbon-targets-worthless-without-roadmap-say-greens/content_136.html": "menu\nBristol Airport’s Master Plan Consultation (open until 6th July – link) announces an aspiration to be carbon neutral by 2030. This is despite a plan to grow by 50% in the next few years, and to more than double in size in the longer term. But a small amount of digging by a Green Party councillor has revealed that the airport has no plan in place for delivering this rapid decarbonisation. And more shockingly, it does not include the emissions from flights in the calculation of its carbon footprint.\nAfter reading the consultation document, Councillor Carla Denyer contacted the Bristol Airport consultation team to ask for details of their carbon management plan. The responses she received (see Appendix_-_Airport_emails.pdf) revealed that the airport only has a ‘Stage 1’ Airport Carbon Accreditation, meaning that the airport has not yet demonstrated that it is taking steps to reduce its carbon footprint, only that is it measuring it. And while insisting that it had one, the airport was unwilling to release a copy of its carbon management plan despite two requests. The Airport representative also explained that “emissions from flights are out of scope” of their 2030 carbon neutrality target.\nCouncillor Denyer commented following the revelation,\n“In the Airport’s glossy consultation booklet, the aspiration to be carbon neutral by 2030 is printed next to a photograph of an aircraft engine, (below) clearly implying that emissions from flights would be included. This kind of misleading ‘greenwashing’ is just cynical PR from the airport and does nothing for the sustainability of our city and country. There is already widespread concern that the expansion of Heathrow Airport, which was approved by MPs last week, will make it very hard to meet our national CO2 commitments [1]. Expanding Bristol airport could be the straw that breaks the camel’s back. It is very hard to see how the airport could achieve carbon neutrality in 12 years without yet having a road map for it, while expanding the airport at the same time.”\nThe City of Bristol has made a commitment to be carbon neutral by 2050, while the Climate Change Act requires the UK to make an 80% cut in emissions. And the Joint Spatial Plan for the region – which includes North Somerset and the geographical area covered by the airport – contains an explicit commitment to making a 50% cut in emissions by 2036.\nAir travel remains the most climate-damaging form of travel, and significant expansion of air travel will therefore have a significant climate impact.\nAnd this is an equality issue as well as an environmental one. According to the Civil Aviation Authority’s passenger surveys, 47% of the UK population has flown in the last year, and this figure has been stable over the last 15 years. Most of those people only make one or two trips per year, while 10% of the population makes about 60% of all flights, and these people are mainly from the highest income groups. [2] This means that airport expansion disproportionally benefits wealthier households while it negatively affects us all through climate change, air pollution and noise pollution.\nCouncillor Denyer summed up,\n“Without a clear and feasible path to decarbonisation, the airport’s plans are worth less than the paper they’re written on. It is up to us as citizens to tell the airport and political leaders that we will not accept such a cavalier attitude to carbon emissions, and the airport must develop a workable road map to full decarbonisation before the expansion plans are agreed. The consequences are no less than the future liveability of our planet.”\nThe consultation is open until 6th July at https://www.bristolairport.co.uk/future and you can write to the leaders of North Somerset and Bristol Councils, and the West of England Combined Authority, using the details below:\nBackground\n1) The Committee on Climate Change found that the UK target of reducing emissions by 80 per cent below 1990 levels could be achieved only if emissions from the UK aviation industry do not exceed 37.5 million tons – the level seen in 2005. And yet, a report released by the Department for Transport has already revealed that aviation emissions will hit 43 million tons by 2030 if the Heathrow expansion goes ahead. https://www.independent.co.uk/infact/heathrow-airport-expansion-vote-third-runway-climate-change-chris-grayling-a8415881.html\n2) Calculated by David Banister based on the National Travel Survey data and the Civil Aviation Authority’s Air Passenger Surveys: https://theconversation.com/heathrows-third-runway-is-expensive-polluting-and-unequal-why-the-poor-will-lose-out-98781",

Green Councillor Cleo Lake is bringing a motion on the issue, alongside Labour Deputy Mayor Asher Craig. The motion calls on the Mayor to support a ‘reparations plan for Bristol’ and publicly call for a national All-Party Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry on the issue. (see below for FAQ on reparations)\nBetween 1689-1807 Bristol ships, funded by Bristol Merchants carried 500,000 enslaved people from Afrika into forced labour oversees. In the 1730s about 40% of Bristol’s trade was made up of the inhumane trafficking of people.\nGreen councillor Cleo Lake, who is tabling the motion said:\n“I think it is necessary for institutions such as Bristol City Council to publicly support the process towards reparations, understanding that this goes beyond diversity and equality agendas and schemes of work. Naming reparations can in itself also help Afrikan Heritage communities to galvanise awareness towards their own reparations plan. There is so much to do to repair from this horrendous history both from an Afrikan Heritage perspective and within wider society. Today is a historic moment where we can go some way towards what must be done to atone and repair from the past so that we may heal as a city and deliver a far better future. Bristol is an international city and I hope that there will be international dialogue, action and positive repercussions as a result of passing this motion.\n“Bristol played a leading role in trafficking and enslaving people, so as a city we now need to play a leading role in being honest about that and calling for systemic change. We want to see a national All-Party Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry to be part of a process of repair. The Inquiry should look at the harm done from Afrikan enslavement and decide on the reparations now needed.”\n“Reparations is not a paycheck for the descendants of people who were enslaved – it is a process outlined by the UN which looks for ‘holistic repair’. This can include public apologies, social justice initiatives, education or cultural projects, commemorative ceremonies, affirmative action and much more.”\n“I worked with African Heritage communities, community leaders and other politicians to develop this motion and it is something I know many people in my community care deeply about. I know that today’s meeting will show that strength of feeling, with many residents and activists coming forward to submit statements of support. I just hope that councillors and the Mayor will listen and support it. If Bristol is to succeed in addressing racism and inequality, we have to be honest about our city’s true history and it’s legacy. ”\nFAQs: Reparations for Afrikan Enslavement\nBristol Green Party Councillors\n“Why are reparations for Afrikan enslavement important in Bristol?”\nBristol merchants grew rich through Afrikan enslavement and this legacy is still with us – not only in the buildings that surround us, but also in the rife inequalities of wealth, power and opportunity across our city. For example, black African young people are persistently disadvantaged in education compared to their white peers, according to the Runnymede Trust.\nOur present is affected by our history. Between 1689 – 1807 Bristol ships, funded by Bristol merchants, carried 500,000 enslaved people from Afrika into forced labour overseas. Many people died on the ships. Those who survived were branded, separated from their families and deprived of their humanity and culture.\nIn the 1730s about 40% of Bristol’s trade was made up of inhumane trafficking of people. The impacts of enslavement and colonialism on our city and communities can still be seen today – as can the racism and inequity that still prevail.\n“What are we calling for?”\nAcross the country we need a process of repair by looking at the harm done from historic enslavement and the reparations needed. We need a national conversation on the reality and impact of Afrikan enslavement, which so few of us learnt about in schools. We need to understand the human cost of our country’s involvement in enslavement and how this impacts the lives of people today. Only then will we be able to repair some of the ongoing harm from our past.\nThe Green Party has this year committed to seeking reparations for enslavement, becoming the first major national party to do so. In Islington and Lambeth, Green councillors have already successfully brought motions calling for their Council to support reparations.\nIn Bristol, Green councillor Cleo Lake has been working with community groups and other parties to call for Bristol to face up to its involvement in enslavement. She has worked with Labour Deputy Mayor Asher Craig to put forward a motion to Bristol City Council, calling for a Bristol City Council commitment to reparations. This will be voted on 2nd March 2021.\nBristol’s reparations motion calls for:\nThe full motion can be found here>>\n“Are reparations a pay-check to the descendants of enslaved people?”\nNo. ‘Reparation’ is actually a legal concept defined by the UN which calls for holistic repair. It can include public apologies, social justice initiatives, education, cultural projects, commemorative ceremonies, affirmative action and much more. There are some cases where reparations has included some form of economic compensation, but reparatory justice is far wider than that.\nReparations are not simply a long-overdue ‘pay cheque’, but a process of holistic repair. We do not have the answers as to exactly what reparations should look like – that’s why what we are calling for is a process of repair which hears from many of the voices in our communities that have been impacted and are often not heard.\n“All this happened years ago, isn’t it time to move on?”\nThe enslavement of Afrikan people who were treated as sub-human ‘chattel’ to be owned, used and discarded is a crime against humanity with long-lasting consequences. As a society we should accept that all crimes against humanity should be marked and that those who lost their lives should be remembered. And most of all that we must acknowledge and learn from the past to be able to move forward.\nAfrikan enslavement continues to have direct consequences today, including racial discrimination and structural inequalities. If we are serious about addressing these issues, we cannot just pretend that the past did not happen. Instead, we need to be open and honest about our past, including acknowledging who paid the price and who benefitted from enslavement.\n“Britain led the way in abolishing enslavement, isn’t it time others to take some responsibility for what happened?”\nIt is true that some people in British society helped to bring about abolition. But they were not the only ones – for many years the stories of enslaved people who resisted and fought for abolition have been marginalised.\nMany British people, businesses and organisations also resisted abolition. When the abolition act came into force in 1833, Britain had been involved in the enslavement of Afrikan people for over 270 years. In 1837 the Slave Compensation Act was passed, which compensated those who benefitted from enslavement for their lost income. The £20 million paid in compensation at the time was not fully repaid by British taxpayers until 2015. Bristol’s plantation owners and merchants received over £500,000 in compensation which would be worth up to £2,036,000,000 today.\nAfrikan enslavement was a transatlantic trafficking of people. It involved governments, communities, businesses and institutions all over the world. But to focus only on what others should be doing to make amends is to forget the important role that Britain played, and the ongoing consequences this has today both globally and nationally.\nA note on language\n“Why don’t you use the words “slave trade” or “slave” ?\nThe language we use is important. We have thought carefully and consulted on the words we use in this document. They may change again in the future as we continue to listen and learn.\nWe avoid the term ‘slave trade’ as it implies a peaceful two-way exchange of equal ‘goods’. It does not adequately describe the forced capture and exploitation of people for economic gain. Instead, we use the term ‘enslavement’ or ‘Afrikan enslavement’ or in some contexts ‘trafficking of enslaved people’.\nThe term “slave” is a passive term which describes the individual as a passive victim, rather than a person with their own identity and agency who was en-slaved against their will. Instead we use the term ‘enslaved person’.\n“Why do you keep spelling Africa wrong?”\nYou could in fact argue that ‘Africa’ is the wrong spelling as it was changed upon the arrival of Europeans who substituted the ‘K’ for a ‘C’. Today the use of the letter ‘K’ signifies Afrikan unity and the importance of a shared political language and is used widely by the campaigners who have spent many years fighting for reparatory justice.",

This comes in the wake of today’s announcement that up to 1,000 council jobs could be lost in Bristol in this financial year, a move that has been condemned by Trade Unions.\nCharlie Bolton, Leader of the Green Council Group, said:\n“We stand alongside the unions who are opposing the cuts which will decimate essential public services across Bristol, and the impact this will have on the most vulnerable in our city. This government seems determined to systematically dismantle local councils with no regard for the pain this will cause ordinary people.”\nTony Dyer, Green Party Spokesperson for Local Government said:\n“In addition to savage cuts in services that so many Bristolians rely upon, people working in local government have faced years of uncertainty and pay freezes – now 1 in 6 of them could now lose their jobs this autumn. This is devastating to the people concerned and their families, and will also have a serious impact on the delivery of vital council services.”\n“Austerity is simply not working and it is vital that our local MPs, Mayor and councillors provide consistent opposition against these Tory cuts to local government finances”\nEconomist and Green MEP for the South West, Molly Scott Cato, said:\n“The new Chancellor has made clear that Brexit is the final nail in the coffin of the Tories’ failed austerity politics. Yet it seems from today’s announcement that Bristol will still be forced to suffer, with the Council needing to make further cuts of £29 million to balance its books as a result of this moribund economic strategy.”\n“We know that an announcement of public investment in infrastructure and a new industrial strategy are coming soon. Bristol’s politicians need to ensure that the city and the region receive their fair share of public investment to secure jobs in the public sector and create new opportunities, especially by capitalising on the huge potential for renewable energy investment, including the manufacture of turbines and solar panels. We also need a Mayor who can stand up for Bristol and demand that government reviews its decision to cut council budgets”.\nImage: Chris Devers: https://www.flickr.com/photos/cdevers/4602805654/\nNotes\nBristol City Council today announced that a voluntary severance scheme will be launched and that there could be a further 1,000 job losses: http://news.bristol.gov.uk/voluntary-severance-scheme-launched-as-council-warns-of-up-to-1000-job-losses/",

If approved, new HMO developments in areas of Cotham, Clifton Down and other HMO hotspots would be refused permission except in exceptional circumstances. The policy has been proposed in response to a rapid expansion of this type of housing in recent years, which has restricted supply of other types of homes and caused friction between residents in some parts of the city.\nThe new policy also sets higher quality standards for HMOs in an attempt to improve housing conditions: room sizes, sound insulation and bin and bike storage.\nThe proposed policy is available to view and comment on at https://www.bristol.gov.uk/planning-and-building-regulations/review-draft-hmo-planning-document and closes on Friday 11 September.\nGreen councillor Clive Stevens helped design the policy with a small group of councillors from other parties, including Lib Dem Councillor Anthony Negus, Conservative Councillor Mark Weston and Labour Councillors Paul Smith and Nicola Beech. Councillor Stevens said the over-concentration of this type of housing is exacerbating the city’s housing crisis and leading to repeated complaints from residents over issues such as noise pollution and waste, but he saves most of his criticism for Bristol University for rapidly expanding but failing to provide enough student housing.\nCouncillor Stevens said:\n“Way back in January 2017 I spoke at a Council meeting about how the unmanaged growth of Bristol’s universities (especially University of Bristol) was affecting our city’s housing market and thus the high rent and poor quality of accommodation suffered by students and others. Not enough halls of residence meant too many conversions of homes into HMOs. And in parts of Bristol an over-concentration has also created conflict between residents and students and led to complaints over noise and waste.\n“Since 2017 I’ve been working cross-party with Labour, Tory and Lib Dem councillors to find a solution, and the result is the Council’s new HMO policy that’s just gone out for consultation. This will set higher quality standards for HMOs and prevent new ones from being developed in areas where they already make up 10% or more of properties. I hope it will lead to a more balanced housing mix that works for long-term residents, students and others.”",

A motion1 to the University Court – the University’s advisory body – advising the University to gradually phase out its financial support for the industries causing climate change was only narrowly defeated by 6 votes.\nThe motion from Green Party Councillor Carla Denyer; “Court advises Council to develop a plan for the university to gradually phase out its investments in fossil fuels over a five year period”, fell by 71 votes against, with 65 for, after she proposed the motion and gave a speech2 at the Court’s annual meeting on Friday 27th November 2015.\nCarla said: “I am gutted that my motion fell, but it’s not the end. The Court is only an advisory body to University of Bristol Council who we hope will take a different view. The closeness of the vote shows that fossil fuel divestment is a hot topic and members are fairly evenly divided. The Vice-Chancellor told student campaigners to expect a decision in early 2016.”\n“As the COP 21 international climate talks start in Paris, where Bristol is being represented by amongst others my fellow Green Councillor Daniella Radice, I am pleased that so many members of the Court got behind my motion.”\nAs costs fall for renewable energy, investment returns have steadily improved over the last few years and are expected to achieve grid parity with fossil fuel energy by 2020 (according to UBS and Citibank3), with many fuel reserves likely to become unexploitable ‘stranded assets’. Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of England recently highlighted that “financing the decarbonisation of our economy” was a major opportunity for long-term investors4.\nChris McMahon, Professor of Engineering Design at the University of Bristol said: “I have been collecting signatures from University staff for a letter6 supporting the student campaign to divest, and it is clear that there is support from across the University. Carla made the point in her speech that the University’s existing Ethical Investment Policy5 prohibits it from investing in companies that are at odds with the wider aims and objectives of the University. Given the important scientific work of the Cabot Institute and the University’s Green Capital pledges, this strongly supports the divestment position.”\nIn addition, more than 2000 students signed a petition7 earlier this year calling on Bristol to follow the examples of Oxford and Edinburgh Universities which are already divesting from fossil fuel companies.",

The original motion resolved to restate the climate emergency, back the Mayor’s ‘One City Plan’ and for council party group leaders to write letters to their party leaders for support. Labour party members in the public gallery also called for concrete actions in the Public Forum section of the meeting.\nThe Greens proposed an amendment that added requests for the Council administration to commit to implement policies proposed by the Green New Deal Group and those suggested by Friends of the Earth, such as:\n– Ensure every decision made by the Council is compatible with the Climate Emergency and the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals\n– Begin work on a Congestion Charge or Workplace Parking Levy to raise funds and support cleaner, cheaper public transport\n– Halt major roadbuilding, which contributes to more traffic and carbon emissions – prioritise infrastructure that will improve quality of life and make it easier for people to get out of their cars\n– Write stronger Local Plan policies to make all new developments on private and Council land ‘climate emergency-proof’\n– Use the Council’s influence on the multi-billion pound Avon Pension Fund to fully divest out of fossil fuels and into renewables and low-carbon housebuilding\n– Oppose Bristol Airport expansion\nHowever the amendment was voted down by Labour and Conservative Councillors and the original motion passed. Green councillor Carla Denyer proposed the amendment, and has also co-proposed a motion on the Green New Deal to the Green Party Autumn Conference. She said:\n“We tried to work with Labour on their motion because the Green New Deal is so important – it has the potential to be a powerful project that transforms the UK, tackling environmental and social injustice and building the kind of Green future we need, not the climate crisis we’re heading towards. Signing up to the Green New Deal means committing to actually carry out Green New Deal policies, not just writing to people to ask them to support it. So I proposed an amendment to Labour’s motion which added practical, achievable actions from the UK Green New Deal group and Friends of the Earth, that the council could take on now, as well as calling for support for the more complicated things like changing the economy.”\nGroup leader Eleanor Combley said:\n“When we declared a Climate Emergency last year I had high hopes that the Mayor got the message: in this environmental crisis, Bristol needs action, not words, and needs it now, not in the distant future. Unfortunately once again tonight the Mayor and Bristol Labour showed that they are happy to talk the talk on climate change, while voting down real actions proposed by the Greens to deal with it. A Green New Deal is not an empty slogan to put on leaflets – it is a plan to tackle the climate crisis that features real policies like divesting from fossil fuels, or using funds from a workplace parking levy to fund public transport improvements – work we could get started on right away. Instead, in this motion, the Labour administration hide behind the things they can’t do because central government hasn’t yet given us the funding or the powers.\n“Let’s be clear – we have just 11 years to act. Central Government are woefully adrift from their own targets, and therefore I am happy to join calls for the powers and the funding we need and ‘reiterate’ the climate emergency as suggested by the motion. But there are actions this council can take now, and this motion’s ‘wait for government’ approach is just not good enough.”\nBackground\nThe Full Green Amendment to the Labour motion can be read here.

Making a speech in support of the motion, Green Councillor for Redland Martin Fodor said:\n“Lord Mayor, I rise to second this motion and confirm that Greens endorse this call for a Peoples Vote on Brexit.\nIt builds on work by Greens on Brighton Council and in London, supported by other parties, and we are happy to add our voice in Bristol. Our party Brexit spokesperson, MEP Molly Scott Cato has consistently said a ratification referendum is needed before implementing Brexit. Increasing doubts and divisions mean this is even more essential.\nLast year Global Greens and European Greens gathered in Britain and shared their concerns at the act of self harm underway in Britain. Until we know and agree the full details of the Brexit deal it seems inconceivable that we should be proceeding.\nMayor Rees, please draft this proposed letter and please include some key points:\n– The national security concerns – loosening ties to our neighbours and allies – could seriously affect our security in various ways. We need to know the implications to decide if the future arrangements are adequate.\n– Local Universities are also clear that Brexit is already damaging research bids, teaching staff recruitment/retention, and student intake – do we get a say?\n– As an officer, I worked with colleagues across the EU on several projects, representing Bristol. The benefits of mutual exchange, collaboration, and policy influence from a cities perspective were indisputable. We need to know how these links can be maintained – or not.\nLast year I helped staff with a bid to partners across Europe on a sustainable drainage project to help manage flood risk in our city, but this unravelled. We’re losing access to Horizon 2020, and the vital European Regional Development Funds. Will these be replaced? It’s well known that government policy uses competition for grants, whereas many regional funds from the EU come when the area qualifies. Which will it be?\nI suggest the Mayor also contacts his party leader, not just councils, and the local government bodies: like the LGA. Bristol needs active support from the Opposition in Parliament.\nAt present local government and regions have a direct voice into the policy and law making in the EU with local government representation in Committee of the Regions. Local government gets a say as of right. Without that place around the table shall no longer have a voice as legislation gets drafted in London. I’d like a vote when I know how the proposed central and local government liaison body will function before Brexit.\nPersonally I feel very strongly about my rights as a European being taken away. My entire heritage is elsewhere in Europe and losing the right to visit, live or work across the travel area with my EU passport is distressing.\nMany of us represent local families now threatened with breakup.\nOur city has been enriched by its place in the EU and I hope all members will support this motion and call for a ratification referendum on the actual terms of the deal and the chance to remain in the EU.”",

The venue was closed down a year ago and is now boarded up and starting to deteriorate. The local community are campaigning for Faithspace to be retained for local community use, rather than just sold to the highest bidder.\nOver 700 local residents have signed a petition calling for the Faithspace to be retained for community use and local residents, children and councillors marched together to the Full Council meeting last Tuesday to show their strength of feeling.\nOne of Southville’s Green Councillors, Stephen Clarke said:\n“Community space is the life blood of an area and Southville desperately needs Faithspace to remain as an asset for the community here. Despite the population of Southville growing by over 20% in the ten years between 2002 and 2012, we now have considerably less space for use by the community than we had then; this is terrible for community cohesion. The whole community appeals to the council to help us!”\nGreen Party leader, Natalie Bennett visited Faithspace earlier this month to add her voice to the campaign to save the community building.\nGreen Councillor Charlie Bolton, who accompanied her, said:\n“We have seen the strength of feeling among those in Southville, who are all calling for the Methodists not to merely sell the site to the highest bidder. 100 people came together to attach hearts to the former church in a love-bomb, and residents attended the last Full Council meeting en masse to call for the Mayor to intervene in any way he can.”\n“As the six month moratorium preventing the building being flogged on the open market comes to an end, it is even more important that we work out a way forward to protect this vital community space.”\nThe visit from Natalie Bennett, leader of the Green Party followed many months of campaigning from Southville’s Green councillors.

The rowdy and diverse crowd grilled candidates on a wide range of issues such as housing, jobs and employment, youth opportunities, human rights, discrimination, radicalisation, and cuts and benefits; eliciting often intense responses from the floor. Questions were accompanied by frequently harrowing accounts from people experiencing the sharp end of austerity policies.\nWe started off with a question from a young Somali woman who outlined the experience of herself and far too many others of feeling closed off from job opportunities in Bristol and marginalized by society at large, and asked the candidates what they would do about it. Labour’s Thangham Debbonair to her credit spoke well on her families experience of migrating to this country ‘when Landlords could put up signs that said no blacks, no Irish, no dogs’, Labour’s historic role in migrant rights struggles, and the need for greater tolerance and diversity. This marked a positive contrast to Labour’s recent pandering to UKIP by pledging to get tough on immigration and strengthening boarders; winning her an applause.\nDarren outlined the need for more opportunities for young people in general, like widening access to education by scrapping fees and abolishing student debt and investing in the public sector to create new jobs. Specifically in relation to the question he stressed the need to empower marginalized groups and to confront discrimination. He was well received and even Liberal Democrat Stephen Williams and Conservative Clare Hiscott got rare applauses for recounting their own parties attempts to diversify their candidates.\nNext a question from a community youth worker, outlined the disastrous effects that the cuts to council budgets are having on youth services and asked the candidates what they would do. Darren stated the Green Party’s stance which has been ‘unequivocal on the need to end austerity and cuts to councils and public services’. Continuing he explained that councils have endured disproportionate cuts to their budgets, year after year, they’ve worked hard to find these savings and still function, but there just isn’t anything more that can be cut without the loss of essential services; winning him one of many big rounds of applause.\nThangham also received a strong applause for stating Labour would raise council budgets if elected, but was questioned as to how they could do this whilst cutting £30 billion from public spending by 2017 (with many other areas already immune from cuts). Stephen Williams and Claire both received heckles and jeers as they attempted to push the government line that ‘you’re not going to like it but’ (says Stephen) there isn’t any more money and we have to make cuts, and that (if the austerity parties – including Labour – win) further ‘cuts to council budgets are inevitable’.\nThe chair had to intervene (the first of many such interventions) to remind the floor to allow the candidates to speak, to hold them to account at the ballot box, and to express their feelings with thumbs up and thumbs down signs. But that can be hard to do when talking about such controversial issues that have had such a real and negative impact on the lives of so many peoples.\nDarren got his biggest cheer for refuting this idea that public debt is disastrously high, explaining how ‘after World War II national debt was around 240%, and we were able to create the NHS and the welfare state; today it is less than 90% and we found half of that to bail out the banks, so don’t let anyone tell you there’s no money to invest in our society’.\nThis was indicative of the evening, with the audience warming to Thangham and especially Darren; whilst Stephen and Claire struggled to defend their government’s record on housing, jobs, zero hours contracts, privatisation and broken promises. The mood of the room prompted Stephen Williams to waste his response to an entire question on Tax Justice and instead attack Darren and the Green Party (perhaps rightly seeing them as the main opposition). He then went on to attack the audience for supporting Darren to continued cries from the floor of ‘answer the question’.\nThis wasn’t an overly Green audience (one woman had even tried to storm the stage to challenge Darren), just lots of ordinary people fed up with austerity and looking for fairness. It was easy to see why the majority of the audience were warming to Darren and the Greens as he outlined a bold vision of hope for an actual alternative to self defeating cuts and austerity.\nTime and again we saw this. On Housing for instance – one of the most hotly debated issues – Darren proudly proclaimed that instead of treating housing primarily as financial assets we would end right to buy and invest in the construction of 500,000 socially rented homes. Instead of trusting in the market to meet our housing needs we would commit to fundamentally changing the housing market by promoting tenants rights, legislating to bring in longer tenancies, enacting rent caps, and ending exploitative tenancy fees.\nThe central argument running through Darren’s answers was the need to rebalance our society in the interests of ordinary people and the environment, so that we all have a decent standard of living and we’re not destroying the planet. ‘Take back the power’ Darren said as he outlined our approach to community owned renewable energy projects, a statement expressive of our wider approach to politics.\nThe drama didn’t end with the passionately contested debate. As the evening of incendiary question came to a close a fire broke out in the bathroom and we had to evacuate. Outside from the conversations of the crowd it seemed clear that most people had thought Thagham had done well, but that Darren had won.\nThe mood of the hustings reflected both the recent polls and the experience of canvassers on the door. General disillusion with the damaging austerity mantra of cuts and privatisation, and the search for an alternative. This is why the hustings on Monday, and Bristol West in general have turned their backs on the Coalition. People want something better. Thangham is stronger than the average Labour candidate, but sadly should she win she’ll still be whipped to follow her party leadership and its policy – which on far too many points is barely distinguishable from the other main parties. On Monday night Darren offered a credible alternative, and it was eagerly received.\n[With thanks to Daisy Brasington for providing photos]",

Most crucially, she says, the importance of ensuring that sufficient revenue is generated from corporate taxation to ensure investment in green infrastructure and public services. She believes that the Chancellor’s failure to meet his targets for deficit reduction – not to mention the burgeoning debt itself – points to a fundamental failure in the money system.\nDr Scott Cato, who is a member of the Economics and Monetary Affairs Committee in the European Parliament and has special responsibility for tax affairs, and is Green Party speaker on finance, said:\n“Plans on corporate tax dodging are small steps in the right direction but the Chancellor needs to get really serious about tax avoidance and also end his opposition to the Financial Transaction Tax. This could raise billions and bring an end to the cruel politics of austerity.\nThe recent ‘LuxLeaks’ scam has revealed the huge extent of tax avoidance in Europe and it is depriving governments of the revenue they need to invest in the infrastructure of a civilised society. The government must treat white-collar crime as seriously as other crime by enforcing its own General Anti Abuse Rule. To do this it is essential there are as many government employees investigating tax avoidance as there are accountants employed by the Big Four accounting firms helping corporations avoid paying their fair share.”\nDr Scott Cato also wants changes to the way in which money is created in the economy, an issue recently debated in the House of Commons for the first time in 170 years. She said:\n“Most MPs lack a sufficient understanding of money creation, leaving them ill-equipped to legislate on finance policy. With 97% of the money in our economy created by banks, they make vital decisions about the creation of money and where it is invested. This results in the diversion of money away from socially useful activities and towards speculative activity. The power to create money must be taken away from banks and returned to a democratic, transparent and accountable body. New money must only be created and used to benefit the public and society as a whole, rather than just the financial sector.”\nResponding to the news that the government is to fund a ‘Roads revolution’, with £2 billion earmarked to dual sections of the A303/30 and a tunnel under Stonehenge in her constituency of the South West, Dr Scott Cato said:\n“The £15 billion ‘roads revolution’ is economic and environmental illiteracy at a time when councils in my constituency are cutting rural bus services due to lack of funds and average distances travelled by car have been declining. I want to see a railways revolution – investment in a publicly owned railway; and a revolution against fuel poverty – a massive home insulation programme. £15 billion on warmer homes and public transport would work for the common good and address climate change; the ‘roads revolution’ will take us nowhere.”\nMolly Scott Cato is the first elected Green MEP for the South West of England and Gibraltar and is one of 50 Green/EFA MEPs in the European Parliament.

A government-funded review has come out in favour of the £1.3bn tidal lagoon in Swansea Bay and for developing a network of larger lagoons around the UK. This would likely include Bridgwater in Somerset. Molly said:\n“I have visited Tidal Lagoon Power, the company behind the Swansea Bay tidal lagoon, and was very impressed; the project has my full backing.\n“Tidal power can play a vital role in our energy transition. It is part of the renewables mix that could deliver at least 100% of the energy needs of the South West. Given the government’s obsession with nuclear power and fracking, it is refreshing to see the Conservatives backing a truly green energy technology”.\nMolly also believes that tidal power and other forms of renewable energy have huge potential for creating an industrial renaissance in the South West. Tidal Lagoon Power have pledged to build the turbines for the Swansea tidal lagoon in the South West. Molly said:\n“Climate change is the most serious and urgent threat we face as a human community. But tackling this crisis needn’t be onerous. Indeed, on the contrary, it can help our region create skilled green jobs and help the local economy thrive”.\nLast November, Molly launched a report exploring how the current 2000 or so Trident-related jobs in and around Devonport in Plymouth could be replaced by green jobs, making use of existing local skills and facilities. She said:\n“Devonport Dockyard provides a great example of how skills could be transferred towards creating a new green industrial revolution.

They also raised the unfairness of proposed cuts, which would see the poorest households in the city face steep tax increases. Recent studies have suggested that removing council tax support may end up costing councils more in the long run due to decreased collection rates.\nToday it was confirmed that the Council plans to continue the consultation as is. The Mayor suggested that the consultation text in its current form is sufficient to explain why the Council has proposed the cuts and it does not need to offer citizens a ‘no cuts’ option.\nGreen Group leader Councillor Eleanor Combley said the Greens were disappointed with the Mayor’s response, saying:\n“I am surprised that Marvin has decided to press ahead with the consultation in its current form – I would have thought there were clear similarities between Bristol and Haringey in this case and ending (or at least re-launching) this consultation would be prudent. I hope this is not going to lead to a lot of money wasted defending a legal case, but whether this consultation covers the bare legal minimum or not, I think there is a clear moral argument for giving the people of Bristol a genuine choice to protect the poorest in the city.

The motion is inspired by the recent IPCC report which warned that humanity has 12 years to take emergency action in order to prevent global warming greater than 1.5°C. Above this, the risks to humanity of floods, droughts, extreme heat and poverty become much greater, impacting on hundreds of millions more people.\nThe motion is on the agenda and expected to be debated (as it is a ‘silver motion’ which means it is the second motion on the meeting agenda). It notes the progress already made by Bristol Council (meeting its corporate carbon reduction target three years early and committing to making the city carbon neutral by 2050) and argues that as a former European Green Capital, Bristol Council has an important role to play in leading the UK in reducing carbon emissions as fast as possible. It asks the city’s Labour Mayor to declare a Climate Emergency and pledge to make Bristol carbon neutral by 2030 (bringing forward the current target by 20 years), call on national government for more powers and resources to support this, work with partners in Bristol and other governments both in the UK and nationally to prevent climate change above 1.5°C, and to report back in six months on the actions that will be taken to address the emergency.\nThe IPCC report focusses on the impact that 1.5°C would have on the planet compared to 2°C. Some of the key findings were:\n– Insects and plants were almost twice as likely to lose half their habitat at 2°C compared with 1.5°C warming\n– Coral populations would be wiped out at 2°C warming but more than 10% would have a chance of surviving at the lower temperature\n– Global fish stocks would lose 3 million tonnes at 2°C, twice the decline of 1.5°C, due to lower oxygen levels and greater acidity in the ocean\n– Hundreds of millions more people, particularly in less developed countries, would be at risk of climate-related poverty with a 2°C increase\n– The global population exposed to water stress would be 50% lower with 1.5°C warming\n– At current levels, the world is on course for 3°C of warming\nCouncillor Carla Denyer explained “We’ve seen the Extinction Rebellion protests in London – across the country people are waking up to the huge threat to human and animal life from runaway global warming. But despite this existential crisis the Government is fast-tracking the expansion of fracking, which will have a huge impact on the environment. We just can’t afford to wait for politicians in Westminster to act – we’re already in a state of climate emergency so my motion is asking that the Council recognises this and takes action now. As a green city in one of the wealthiest countries in the world, Bristol has an opportunity and a responsibility to take the lead on climate change.”\nDavid Beasley, a Bristol resident who was at the Extinction Rebellion in London, said:\n“Despite all the climate agreements made in the past, carbon emissions are still rising. Our political leaders are still not yet taking this issue seriously. I took part in the protest in London because I feel strongly about putting right what I see as an injustice that’s being perpetrated against all living things on the planet. Climate change is an issue that’s been important to me for more than thirty years. Back then, the objective of campaigners was get people to understand what climate change was, and why it was such a big problem. I don’t think it ever occurred to us that, once the problem was recognised, politicians would still fail to take effective and timely action. We need urgent action now and I encourage everyone who cares about the future of our planet to write to their councillors asking them to support this motion.”\nNotes:\n– If you would like to contact your councillors to ask them to support this motion you can find their contact details here.\n– If you would like to submit a statement to Full Council to support the motion, please email your statement to democratic.services@bristol.gov.uk.

The European Citizens’ Initiative enables people to influence EU law by inviting the Commission to begin legislation on a topic of great public concern [2]. Molly Scott Cato said:\n“One of the last acts of the previous Commission was to refuse to register the European Citizens’ Initiative on TTIP.

Supporters believe the deal will promote economic growth and create jobs – claims widely refuted by experts.

Greens call for an immediate end to austerity-led economics and a rebalancing of the economy so that it works for the common good.\nThe Green Party is unashamed about its ambition to increase both government spending and taxation to help create a fairer, more sustainable society.\nChancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne’s budget announcement of £1.3billion of tax cuts for North Sea oil and gas production with no new investment in renewables shows how out of touch this government is on climate change, says the Green Party, the only party committed to transitioning to a zero-carbon economy.\nNatalie Bennett, Leader of the Green Party of England and Wales, said:\n“This final Coalition budget offers little hope to the many millions of people across Britain who are struggling to get by. Austerity economics has failed.\n“Incomes are still lower than they were in 2010 (1), household debt is up (2) and inequality continues to plague this country. In the world’s sixth-biggest economy, people should not have to queue at food banks or work in insecure jobs that don’t pay enough to get by on.\n“We need to see a radical departure away from the kind of business-as-usual economics on display in today’s budget. That means building an economy that works for the common good, an economy that pays people a Living Wage, protects our public services and invests in renewable technologies that cut fuel bills and help combat climate change.\nCaroline Lucas, Green MP for Brighton Pavilion and the Green Party’s Economy spokesperson, said:\n“This is an electioneering Budget from a Chancellor who puts politics above people.\n“That Mr Osborne would have the nerve to suggest ‘we’re all in this together’ is astonishing and shows just how out of touch the Government is with those it’s supposed to serve. What typical Tory smoke and mirrors.\n“No – we are most certainly not all in this together. Food bank use has rocketed. Hundreds of thousands of public sector jobs have been slashed. Zero-hours contacts are rising. Brutal cuts to services and welfare have hit the poor hardest – while the richest have seen their wealth rise.\n“And all this while granting another eye-watering tax break, at public expense, to multinational oil and gas companies – and just weeks after a cross-party climate pledge. Investment in home-grown renewable technologies would mean more jobs and greater stability in the long term – the business case is incredibly compelling, and a just transition to a zero carbon economy is absolutely crucial to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.”\nMolly Scott Cato, Green MEP for the South-West and the Green Party’s Finance spokesperson, said:\n“We believe that austerity is a political project, designed to reinforce the power of financial and corporate elites, and achieve the long-held ambition of those on the right in politics of bringing about the shrinking of the state.\n“What stands out in this budget is the huge tax breaks for the fossil fuel dinosaurs, which will drag us back from the cusp of a green energy revolution. This is a hugely wasted economic opportunity to drive the transition to a zero carbon economy. Now is the time to divest from fossil fuels not drive forward further exploration.

The Government have been slowly reducing the number of people locked in these ineffective and inhumane centres, but that is not anywhere near good enough.

The government needs to stop detaining innocent people – it’s as simple as that.”\nCarla Denyer, Green councillor for Clifton Down, added:\n“The Green Party has been calling for an end to immigration detention, which should start with the Home Office immediately putting a time limit on detention, and exploring compassionate, community based alternatives.”\nThe UK is the only country in Europe with indefinite detention and the Greens are the only UK political party calling for an end to the policy.

It is vital to recognise the importance of clean, breathable air to everyone’s health and wellbeing – air pollution is rapidly becoming known as a silent killer. Among adults it is thought to contribute to about 1 in 13 cases of Lung Cancer and increases the risk of death from cardiac and respiratory issues. Health impacts are worse for children – air pollution is linked to premature births and poor lung development, as well as increased incidence of, and more severe problems with, asthma. (National Clean Air Day facts)\nIt’s therefore crucial to people’s welfare and health to reduce our exposure to (and production of) air pollution as much as possible. One of the main ways you can reduce individual exposure to air pollution is to leave the car at home and take less polluting forms of transport to work or school, whether public transport, walking or cycling. Evidence shows that cyclists are less exposed to air pollution than people travelling by car as well as receiving health benefits from the exercise.\nAt the city level, clean air has been a priority for Bristol Greens since as far back as 1989 (see this press clipping).[3] In 2016 they surveyed over 500 people to get their views on air-quality and found that over half said their health had been affected by poor air quality. In November they put forward a motion – supported unanimously by all councillors – calling on the Mayor to immediately take needed steps to reduce deaths and illness linked to polluted air, commit to implementing a Clean Air Zone in Bristol and to producing an updated Bristol-wide strategy to bring air quality within safe and legal limits.\nLast month a report published by Green MEPs Keith Taylor and Molly Scott Cato revealed the scale of the problem in Bristol, finding that by 2021 as many as 757 deaths in the City could be caused by air pollution (See the Polluted Cities report). Research commissioned by the Council found that over 10% of deaths in Lawrence Hill and Central wards, and between 9% and 10% of deaths in seven further wards in the city, were attributable to air pollution (‘Health Impacts of Air Pollution in Bristol’ p.27). Bristol Greens have launched a 5 point plan to secure clean air in Bristol – details can be found here.\nEleanor Combley, Leader of Bristol’s Green Group of councillors, said, “This is an invisible public health crisis and today Green councillors are impatient to see people’s concerns translated into real improvements in air quality. We look forward to the Mayor’s upcoming progress report next month on action towards achieving clean air in our city”.",

This petition presents a solution that will help achieve that goal and save money – a win-win situation!\n“Other Councils are already ‘Saying No To the Mow’, including Dorset Council, who have developed a successful programme of ‘cut and collect’ on urban verges which has led to the authority saving money, time, and natural habitats. The Plantlife campaign has produced a set of guidelines to help other Councils follow suit.”\nThe idea is that reducing cutting in verges and parks will support wildflowers, providing a habitat and food source for insects and animal life. The UK has lost 97% of its wildflower meadows since the 1930s and many important pollinator species are in decline.\nThe petition text says: “Naturally, each green space may be habitat-specific with a need for some kind of management, and there is also the need to maintain visibility at roadside junctions……but is this relentless pursuit in keeping so many entire green spaces mown to a couple of millimetres really necessary?\n“There is no agenda to completely re-wild all green spaces, verges, parks and cemeteries; it is more a case of achieving the correct balance to enable nature to thrive, while still allowing humans enough space.”\nCouncillor Denyer continued,\n“There is strong demand for more wildlife-friendly outdoor spaces from people in Bristol and across the UK.

The Green motion called on the Council to lobby its multibillion pound local pension fund (Avon Pension Fund) to move its investments out of fossil fuels. The motion and debate came at the end of a council meeting in which the Council presented a report on tackling the Climate Emergency.\nResponding to Labour’s amendment to the Green Party motion, Cllr Fodor said:\n“Four years ago Bristol Labour amended a motion I brought to the council calling for us to pull pension funds out of fossil fuels and removed the call for divestment. Now, at the very same meeting that the Council heard the administration’s plans for the Climate Emergency, Labour have voted with Conservatives to again block action on divestment, amending the Green motion in order to maintain the Pension Fund’s fossil fuel investments and continue with the discredited approach of ‘engagement’ (or ‘having conversations’ with fossil fuel companies).”\n“The time for dialogue with fossil fuel companies is so clearly over – these are the companies who have lobbied for increased methane pollution, asked for tax breaks, and plan expanded exploration and production. They claim to do one thing, like stick to the Paris climate agreement, but act the opposite way. Divestment is also backed by UNISON, the council’s largest union, who recognise that if we do not act soon there is a real risk that workers’ pensions will be stuck invested in ‘stranded assets’ as the value of fossil fuel investments falls.”\nGreens felt they had no choice but to abstain on their own motion after an amendment by Labour made fundamental changes to it. A statement from Bristol Council’s largest union UNISON had earlier urged councillors to vote for the un-amended Green motion.\nCouncillor Fodor explained:\n“Labour’s amendment removed the ‘Divestment’ from our divestment motion so we cannot vote for the motion as amended – it’s pointless. If Labour and Conservative politicians – including our Mayor – want to talk the talk on the climate emergency then they need to follow through in their actions and not block steps to actually achieve carbon neutrality when it counts.\n“Meanwhile Greens will continue to demand the Mayor listens to what his employees in UNISON want – invest in the future economy, not the past, and safeguard the planet for future generations.

The South West has many finance related jobs including back office jobs in Bristol and Bournemouth with around 37,000 of these jobs based in Bristol [2]. The uncertainties over Brexit may push many firms to up sticks and move, and many EU countries are ready to receive them. Now that Article 50 has been triggered, the true extent of the Tories Brexit shambles will be exposed.”\nMore warnings for Bristol come from the recent Local Business Survey which has revealed that the government’s plan for Brexit receives only minority support among South West businesses [3]. The survey of 419 SMEs in Bristol, Bath, Gloucestershire, Swindon and Wiltshire, finds 57% of exporters believe the impact of leaving the single market will be ‘negative’ or ‘very negative’, compared with just 10% who think the impact will be ‘positive’ or ‘very positive’. A previous report revealed that Bristol is one of three cities in the South West topping the list of UK cities exporting to the EU [4].\nMolly Scott Cato said:\n“SMEs realise that leaving the single market will have a devastating impact on their businesses. This is particularly the case for Bristol and other cities in the South West that sell a high proportion of their exports to the EU.

For many businesses in the South West, they are losing control, and are at the whim of the Tory far-right and their obsession with pressing for a hard Brexit. It is clear businesses are also rapidly losing confidence in this government to deliver a Brexit that works in their interests.”\nNotes\n[2] https://www.thecityuk.com/about-us/uk-work-programme/new-u-k-interactive-map-page/south-west/\n[4] http://mollymep.org.uk/2017/01/30/single-market-exeter-plymouth-bristol/",

Instead of daily fees adding up to approx. £7000 per year, the council will instead request a yearly charge of just £100 for businesses that seek to take advantage of the social distancing measures imposed by the authority to trade in suspended bays.\nThe move follows persistent pressure from Clifton Green Councillor Paula O’Rourke, who has repeatedly lobbied the Mayor and the Council’s legal department over the legality, economic impact and fairness of the charges on local businesses trying to stay afloat during lockdown. Paula’s fellow ward Green Councillor, Jerome Thomas, added to the pressure on the council with a petition, which at time of writing had received over 1100 signatures. (https://you.38degrees.org.uk/petitions/suspend-bristol-street-trading-charges-during-covid)\nFollowing repeated discussions with council officers Councillor O’Rourke has now been told the Council will designate the suspended parking bays as ‘pavement’ to get around its previous policy. Instead of being charged a daily rate for use of each suspended bay, Bristol’s businesses will need to apply for a simple licence, which will last until September 2021 and carry a one-off fee of £100. Once approved they will be able to trade in parking bays/pavement without further fees or charges. Until the decision is formally rolled out in a week or two, businesses will be able to continue to use the suspended bays as they already are. The new policy will affect all streets in Bristol with suspended parking bays, so bars and restaurants in other parts of Bristol (e.g. North Street in Southville) will also be able to benefit from the decision.\nResponding to the changes, Green Councillor Paula O’Rourke said:\n“I’m delighted that the Council have scrapped these fees – charging local businesses up to £7000 a year for trying to trade outdoors in the current climate was not sustainable, and not fair as businesses were being penalised for trying to do the right thing and stay afloat in tough circumstances.\n“I know lots of my residents and the small businesses in Clifton will be really relieved at the news – this is a real lifeline for parts of the local economy. And it’s great that this new policy will apply across the whole city, so it won’t just be traders on Princess Victoria St that can benefit from it.”\nPaula added:\n“I’ve spent months going back and forth with local traders and council officers to try and find a way through, and argued my case with the Mayor at council meetings. Credit is due to the administration for listening to the points I was raising and acknowledging the needs of local businesses.”\n– Image: Councillor O’Rourke with Richard Davis, chair of Clifton BID (Business Improvement District)",

This is an important step in the right direction which Bristol’s Green Councillors are pleased to see. However, many busy streets have not been included yet, so we will continue lobbying for other roads where we know that road space reallocation is necessary, and we will keep a close eye on timescales and delivery.\n15th April 2020\nBristol’s Green Councillor group have today called on Bristol Council to look into road space reallocation and traffic calming measures to combat coronavirus. The measures proposed are aimed at making it easier for people in the city to exercise safely while social distancing and to reduce demands on the NHS.\nLeader of the Green Councillor Group, Eleanor Combley, sent an email (see below) to Mayor Marvin Rees and the Cabinet Transport lead Councillor Kye Dudd outlining some of the measures that the Council might look into, including taking space from cars to widen pedestrian space in busy areas or near shops, filtering measures to slow traffic in residential areas, and temporary widening of cycle lanes. She said “we should do everything in our power to keep people safe”.\nAs cities around the world implement measures to allocate more road space to cyclists and pedestrians in response to the pandemic, UK Councils are starting to look into the issue. Brighton and Hove Council recently confirmed they are exploring similar measures, and Hackney councillors are expected to vote soon on a list of ‘filtered’ streets.\nLeader of Bristol Green Group, Councillor Eleanor Combley said:\n“During this crisis it is important that we do everything we can to reduce the burden on the NHS. We can do that by keeping people safe and preventing road traffic accidents. And we can also help slow the spread of COVID-19 by ensuring people have the space to move around for exercise or essential shopping at a safe distance from each other. That is why I am calling on Bristol City Council to take temporary measures to make more space available to pedestrians and cyclists and reduce crowding.\n“Cities across the world are already doing this, from Auckland to Winnipeg and from Berlin to Bogota, and in the UK Transport for London and other councils such as Brighton and Manchester are already actively considering what can be done. We should do everything in our power to keep people safe.”\nFAO Mayor Marvin Rees and Cabinet Transport Lead Kye Dudd\nAnecdotal evidence and stories in the media suggest that some Bristol residents are finding it hard to practise social distancing when outside the house for shopping or exercise – many of the pavements in our city are not wide enough to allow for the 2 metres recommended distance. There have also been many reports by residents and police forces that some drivers are taking advantage of quieter streets to drive dangerously fast. This poses even more of a danger to people who are finding they need to step into the road to adhere to social distancing on busy pavements.\nTo tackle this, we believe the Council should look at what it can do to temporarily reclaim streets for people and communities. Other councils such as Brighton & Hove, Hackney, as well as Transport for London are looking into road space reallocation measures. Some cities like Manchester have already taken action. Traffic calming measures, combined with measures to provide more space for people, can help us tackle the pandemic in Bristol by:\nIn order to achieve this we call on you to commit the Council to explore how we might implement some or all of the following measures in Bristol:\nThese measures could be implemented through introducing an Experimental Traffic Order, or there may be other mechanisms available. We encourage the Cabinet member to liaise with his counterparts in other Councils that are leading on this, to explore creative solutions. We know council staff are busy at the moment, but highways workers have been continuing work such as re-lining existing cycle lanes during the pandemic, and given the multiple benefits of reallocating space to pedestrians outlined above, it would be worth prioritising. You will of course want to liaise with emergency services about any such measures.\nThank you so much for your consideration of this matter, and for all the work you are doing at this time of crisis.\nEleanor Combley\nCouncillor, Bishopston and Ashley Down\nLeader, Green Group, Bristol City Council\n– Cones or other temporary measures to widen pavement space in areas with significant footfall or outside busy shops\n– Temporary measures to close residential streets to through traffic\n– Temporary walking and cycle lanes where possible to be reclaimed from the road\n– Filtering measures to slow traffic in residential streets (As Hackney council is doing)\n– Changing traffic priority measures to improve pedestrian crossing times (to prevent crowds forming while waiting to cross)\n– Extending 20mph to any residential roads not already covered by it – leading doctors have been calling for this to lower the baseline demands placed on the NHS, for example this article in the British Medical Journal.\n– Temporary road pedestrianisation\nTemporary widening of bike lanes where possible to allow cyclists safe overtaking",

The vast majority of them are kept in barren wire cages where their natural behaviour is severely restricted. Despite this factory farming system, no specific EU legislation on minimum standards for the protection of rabbits currently exists which has led scientists, vets and animal welfare campaigners to call for legislation to outlaw the cage system and replace it with one that allows for the natural needs of rabbits.\nSpeaking to the European Parliament today, Molly told MEPs that researchers from Bristol University in her South West constituency concluded that current legislation does not adequately address the welfare needs of rabbits; she said she has received thousands of emails calling for species-specific legislation to protect farmed rabbits across the EU.\nMolly, who is a member of the European Parliament’s Agriculture Committee, said:\n“Greens have long opposed factory farming and today’s success reflects the tireless work by the Green group and animal welfare campaigners in pushing for higher animal welfare standards.\n“We must move toward lower intensity and more compassionate farming methods to safeguard the wellbeing of rabbits and improve health, especially as the current inhumane conditions spread disease and lead to farmers using alarming amounts of antibiotics. And as we know, antibiotic resistance is one of the most serious public health risks facing our world today.\n“Today’s vote has again demonstrated that the closer the relationship the UK maintains with the EU, the better will be the outcome for British animals. Animal advocates across the UK must continue lobbying the UK government to ensure the current legal protections, for all species, offered by our EU membership are maintained and strengthened.”",

The money will be raised by increasing council tax by an additional 2%, the equivalent of an extra 41p a week for the average household1 in Bristol.\nLeader of the Green councillors, Ani Stafford-Townsend said:\n“This money will help to prevent the worst cuts to those in most need of care. Whether you have a parent or grandparent who uses care home facilities, a neighbour who uses disability services or a friend who needs support struggling with depression or addiction, most of us know someone who has used adult social care services at some stage.”\n“No one wants to put up council tax when people across the city struggle to pay their bills, but it is also unacceptable for older people and people with disabilities to be abandoned in their homes without care. To help those on the lowest income pay their council tax, Greens are campaigning for the Council Tax Reduction Scheme to be protected beyond next year.”\n“The adult social care levy is the only way that local councils have of preventing the worst of adult social care cuts imposed by the Tory government. Many cities introduced it as a matter of course – but not Bristol. It seems no coincidence that in an election year the Mayor and the other parties have shied away from proposing this desperately needed council tax rise.”\n“As Greens we feel that some things are just too important to play political games with. We are delighted that Labour and the Lib Dems have now joined with the Greens in voting to prevent the worst cuts to adult social care services. We hope they will continue to join with us and lobby central government to halt the ideological cuts that are seeing the destruction of our local services.”\nThe social care precept will see a weekly increase of 41p for band B households, the most common banding in Bristol.\nAdult social care precept – the government spending review announced that upper tier councils would be able to collect a 2% precept to help fund adult social care, which is facing budget pressure in councils across the country. This gives councils the power to raise additional funds by increasing council tax by up to 2% in addition to any normal council tax rises. If adopted in Bristol, this additional 2% precept would raise £3.5m to be spent on adult social care over 2016/17. At present, the Mayor’s budget proposals have not taken up the government’s 2% precept offer. Current projections predict that the council will be £6.3m over budget for social care over 2015/16.

Molly, who travels extensively by train across the region, said:\n“Like many people, I am sick of being shunted around the region in overcrowded, often filthy, trains that frequently run late or not at all. The South West has some of the most ancient rolling stock in the country and receives less rail investment than any other region in the UK bar one.\n“None-the-less, the fact that Great Western Railway does receive public subsidy and provides such a shoddy service means that they should be accountable to the travelling public. It is high time that company bosses listened to the many woes their customers have through a series of public meetings.”\nThe call to meet the public head-to-head comes at a time when the government has announced controversial plans for a fully privatised railway line between Oxford and Cambridge, with track and trains operated by the same company. Transport minster, Chris Grayling, has also announced that future rail franchises will see integrated operating teams between Train Operating Companies, such as Great Western Railways, and Network Rail who maintain the track. Molly concluded:\n“We also want to see better integration between train companies and track – it’s called public ownership.

Items go on to be used in the city through partner organisations such as the Children’s Scrapstore, Re:work, Sofa Project and Bristol Wood Recycling Project.\nNicci Peck, CEO of SOFA Project, said:\n“It’s been an amazing pilot project, being able to rescue so many items from going to landfill and directing them to a good cause.

The report says that the region is already a national leader in renewable electricity generation but could be expanding more rapidly. Fracking and nuclear power are dismissed in the report as dangerous distractions from the need to invest rapidly in renewable generation.\nDr Molly Scott Cato, lead Green Party European candidate in the South West, said:\n“The damaging winter storms have proved just how vulnerable the South West is to the consequences of a changing climate and a transition to renewable energy is exactly what is needed to tackle climate change. Thankfully, the dynamism and foresighted approach of many people and businesses in the South West means that we are already responding in a positive way and are leading the country in renewable energy generation. It is a shame the government does not share this enthusiasm for renewable energy, preferring instead to champion damaging fracking and dangerous nuclear.”\nThe report draws inspiration from the impressive speed of the energy transition in Germany, where the government has completely abandoned nuclear and set itself the ambitious goal of doubling the renewable electricity generation to 35% by 2020 and achieving 80% renewable electricity generation by 2050.\nDr Scott Cato concluded:\n“The rapid transition in Germany is being achieved as a result of public and community ownership of renewables, including a fivefold increase in the number of renewable energy co-operatives between 2007 (101) and 2011 (586) [2].

We are happy to report that the proposal was unanimously supported. Well done, Alderman Gus!\nSo today marks a very small piece of Green Party history in Bristol and that is because today is the first time a Green party nomination for alderman has ever been considered at a Bristol full council meeting. More importantly, of course, Gus, – if you vote him through – will become the first Green Party-nominated alderman.\nGus was also the first ever Green Party cabinet member in Bristol. As such, he both attracted a lot of flak and can point to some substantial achievements.\nOf course, all cabinet members get flak, as do all mayors. (Well, both of them). They also have the opportunity to achieve.\nBut to us at least, Gus stands out as a trailblazer – as our first ever Green cabinet member, he was ‘boldly going where no Green has gone before’ – and at a time when there were only two Green councillors in total.\nHe was also appointed into George’s rainbow cabinet – I do suspect that some of you will understand what it is like to be in a cabinet with a mayor and other cabinet members who don’t share your political affiliation – leaving you both in a party but also partly isolated from your party.\nGus can point to some real achievements – particularly getting the council to commit to investing tens of millions of pounds in both renewables and into energy efficiency schemes – and therefore making a big contribution towards Bristol’s climate change targets.\nHe was responsible for taking an outsourced and unpopular parks maintenance programme and bringing it in house.\nIn his time as cabinet member, there was not one eviction as a result of the bedroom tax.\nHe took local and sustainable food seriously. I don’t mean just leaving empty pie trays in the office. Indeed he helped get EU funding for a substantial local project but also for helped raise the profile of sustainable food systems in the city.\nHe was part of the team that helped win the ‘Bristol as a Green capital’ project. While I am aware that it is fashionable to criticise any element of Green Capital, it did result in a large amount of money being pumped into local community projects and did actually do a lot of good, and I am sure Gus would be the first to congratulate the thousands of people who volunteered their time – free of charge – to make it happen.\nI asked Rob Telford – Rob was Gus’ co councillor in Ashley – for his opinion of Gus. He said\n‘Gus worked tirelessly with community campaigners, particularly when Assistant Mayor and always responded to those who were trying to do good for their local community\nUnlike most councillors (including myself), he understood how to get on with people from other parties to get things done, sometimes using the “dark arts” as whip to get a deal or arrangement on something, which is against the stereotype of Greens as too pure to be of any use.\nHe didn’t shy away from contentious issues, I’m thinking particularly of RPS where the whole community probably knew where he stood, but yet was open to people who were against it’\nRob concluded by mentioning Gus’s impersonations of a number of councillors, but these should probably remain private for reasons of taste!\nOf course, Gus’ activity on social media is legendary, and – for the most part – best glossed over. I have been told however, he did once tweet to say he didn’t like aborigines. He promises this was an auto-correct thing, and he actually doesn’t like aubergines. As an aubergine lover, I find this deeply offensive.\nThere was also the tv interview he did – live -where the sound cut out and he couldn’t hear the questions he was being asked. Sadly, he tried to bluff his way through, with predictable consequences.\nRob tells us ‘There was a definite “era of the smelly food” in Room 10 – the tiny first office Greens were offered – when fellow councillors complained that Gus had brought in something very pungent, usually from St Nick’s Market. (apparently Daniella called Rob and Gus “smelly boys”)’. Trust me, Rob, it wasn’t just the food.\nGus told me after the last election that that was it for him and politics. I personally hope he changes his mind, but he was looking bit burnt out by the end. Funnily enough, our ex-councillors all look much more relaxed with life – and Gus is no exception. Losing – it seems – can do a world of good for your levels of stress. You should try it.\nMore recently, he has also been heavily involved in the fantastic ‘City to Sea’ project – which aims to cut levels of plastic pollution entering the sea. I am sure – whatever his future – he will continue to work for a greener Bristol, and a greener planet.\nGus isn’t everyones cup of tea, but when I look back – I see someone who has some substantial achievements to his name. He has made Bristol a Greener place. I am also aware that being just some bloke who is thrust into a high profile, trail blazing and stressful position, where he is there to be shot at – takes its toll.\nI don’t know really what the awarding of the honour of alderman means. But if it is about recognition for someone who has put themselves out there for his or her cause, and gone for it – well, you don’t have to agree with the cause, or even like the person – but you should celebrate their endeavours.\nSo in conclusion, I say that I certainly recognise his achievements. I am also honoured to know him. Hence we nominate him for this award. I hope you approve.. Thankyou.",

The latest large-scale study across three European countries was designed to assess the impact of the pesticides in the field rather than the laboratory. Molly said:\n“I am challenging DEFRA secretary Michael Gove to give a public guarantee that he will continue the EU ban on neonicotinoids after Brexit. This can be the first step towards an Environmental Protection Act which can put into practice his promise to enhance rather than diminish environmental standards after we leave the EU.\n“These results from large-scale and scientifically sound field studies should be the final nail in the coffin for neonicotinoids which have decimated the health of our pollinators over recent years. Greens in the European Parliament will continue to push for the ban to be extended to include all uses and to be made permanent.\n“The study results are all the more convincing as they were majority funded by the very chemical companies who have long denied that their toxic products have any negative impact on bee populations or the environment.”",

The cap currently dramatically limits councils from borrowing against their own existing housing stock to build new properties.\nCommenting Sandy said: “The Mayor has a unique opportunity to review the city’s housing and planning policies. As a city we can afford to be much more ambitious now. This needs to be the start of a major change in the number of houses, and especially affordable houses, we’re building in the city. We need to act and deliver the right homes in the right places for the people who needs them, particularly focussing on social housing for those who need it most. This money gives us the ability to lead. We must take this opportunity.”\nDespite Labour’s pledge to build 2000 extra properties a year in Bristol by 2020 – the year of the next Mayoral election – there are still more than 11,000 families on the housing waiting lists and homelessness in the city has continued to rise by more than 128% over the last three years. The recent closure of two emergency homelessness support centres has worsened the situation along with austerity led cuts to essential support services that keep people in their homes.\nSandy added: “This is an opportunity for Bristol City Council to show it can deliver, and we look forward to an announcement at the State of the City address.”\nEleanor Combley, Leader of the Green Group on Bristol City Council, said, “This administration has focused on getting housing built of any type to meet the Labour Mayor’s manifesto target, but Bristol’s housing problem is not just a numbers game. We already have thousands of empty properties in Bristol while the number of homeless people continues to rise. Encouraging developers to build more unaffordable investment properties is not going to change that.\n“Bristol needs a sea change in the housing market to provide genuinely affordable and social housing, and I hope the Labour Mayor will show true ambition for Bristol and lay out plans to seize the opportunity presented by the lifting of the borrowing cap to provide it.”\nPhoto credit: Jon Craig.",

The motion, which passed unanimously, made Bristol the first city in Europe to declare a climate emergency – it has since been followed by over 200 councils in the UK, as well as Parliament itself. However, one year later, Green councillors have warned that Bristol faces a “stark gap” between its current position and the action needed to reach its ambitious 2030 target, citing new evidence released by environmental pressure group Friends of the Earth.\nFriends of the Earth (FoE) have published a new tool called ‘How Climate Friendly is Your Area’ which lets visitors put in their postcode and see how their local council is doing on climate action. The summary for Bristol states that the city is doing “better than most” compared to other local authorities but that all councils need to do much more and “Bristol particularly needs to do much better on improving home insulation and increasing tree cover.”\nBristol scores well on renewable energy generation – it generates 72MW compared to the best comparison which generated 81MW. However FoE note that to achieve carbon neutrality by 2030 Bristol will need to meet tough targets, including more than tripling its tree cover, insulating 11,475 homes per year, and increase cycling uptake to 30% of commuter journeys. According to FoE 8% of commutes in Bristol are by bike – the Council’s current energy efficiency plan is to insulate 1,200 properties per year. (Cabinet April 2018, p188)\nThe report also suggests the Council should cease promoting airport expansion and other ‘high carbon’ infrastructure and divest from fossil fuel companies as soon as possible, issues that Green councillors have challenged the Labour administration on repeatedly. Leader of the Green Councillor Group Eleanor Combley charged the Mayor with “not backing up his words with the action needed” to tackle the climate emergency, citing slow progress on recycling rates and major road building proposals as examples.\nCouncillor Combley said:\n“Friends of the Earth have done a brilliant piece of work which shows us how big a gap we have to close in Bristol if we are going to do our fair share to combat climate change and meet the target we set of going carbon neutral by 2030. I am optimistic that, given the years of work already put in by the council’s energy service, the 81MW target for renewable energy generation should be easy to meet, and exceed. But in other areas we’re faced with a really stark gap between where we are right now and where we’ve got to be.\n“For example we need to increase the proportion of people who travel to work by walking, cycling or public transport from 41% to 70%. This will take a real shift in how we think about transport. Unfortunately we’re not seeing that priority from the Mayor when it comes to Bristol’s key decisions. Developments like the South Bristol link road, an out-of-centre arena (with at least 50% of visitors arriving by car), or a proposal for Cumberland basin that drives a four-lane highway past people’s homes, suggest Marvin Rees is not backing up his words with the action needed to prepare us for a carbon neutral future. Similarly, increasing household waste reuse, recycling and composting from 50% to 70% is simply not going to happen under a Mayor who’s avoided taking bold action to boost our recycling rates.\n“This will not be easy – it lays out the scale of the challenge before us – but not everything Friends of the Earth are calling for is expensive. For example, we’ve repeatedly asked the Mayor to stop promoting new high carbon infrastructure, such as the expansion of Bristol airport, and to support divestment of the Avon pension fund, but there are no signs of him softening his position on either of those in a way that is consistent with declaring a climate emergency. Bristol is doing better than many local authorities in some areas, but if we are really going to show leadership in this climate emergency, we need to see much more and bolder action.”\nBackground\nFind below a summary of Friends of the Earth’s report on Bristol. Sources for FoE figures are in the original report available at https://friendsoftheearth.uk/climate-friendly-communities\n– Housing – according to FoE only 37% of homes in Bristol are well insulated. The city needs to get this figure to 100% by 2030, which means insulating a whopping 11,475 homes per year. At present the council’s energy efficiency plan is to insulate about 1200 homes per each year. (Cabinet April 2018, p188)\n– Transport – just over 40% of people in Bristol commute by public transport, cycling or walking. Friends of the Earth suggest a target of 70%. This could be met by improving public transport – RAC survey suggests that 6 in 10 drivers would shift to public transport if its quality improved. It could also be done by improving cycle infrastructure – currently just 8% of people in Bristol ride bikes to work, but research cited by FoE suggests 30% of commuter journeys in Bristol could be made by bike.\n– Energy – this is one area where Bristol is doing well, as the city generates 72MW of renewable energy, not far behind the leading local authority which generates 81MW.\n– Trees – FoE suggest Bristol sets a target of increasing its tree cover to 20% of the local area. This would mean more than tripling the city’s current tree cover as national forestry data suggests just 6% of the Bristol area is woodland.\n– Waste – FoE say Bristol needs to reuse, recycle and compost 70% of its waste by 2025. Mayor Marvin Rees set a target of 55% by 2020 in his 2016 manifesto although the Council does not seem to be on track to close this gap as the Council’s result last year was just under 45%.\n– Divestment and airport expansion – FoE note that one way for Bristol Council to reduce emissions would be to divest council pensions out of fossil fuel investments and move them instead into green technologies. Greens campaigned for this and proposed a motion to enact it in July this year, which was supported by the Council’s largest staff union UNISON – however Labour and Conservative councillors amended the Green motion in order to prevent action. Greens have also repeatedly called on the Mayor to oppose the expansion of Bristol Airport which plans to more than double in size. However the Mayor has not changed his support for expansion, despite a new report finding that the Airport had overstated the benefits and that there could be “no economic benefit” to the expansion.",

We pay over £3 million a year to subsidise First buses, yet fares are still extortionate, services run late, and all the profits leak out of the system into shareholders’ pockets. The revenue from our buses should belong to the people of Bristol and be used to improve our transport. Through taking back the buses, we can give free travel for under 16s, and, yes, charge a fare of £1.50 on routes within the city.”\nThe buses of Bristol were privatised in 1986 under the Thatcher government, and have been run by private firms ever since.\n“Bristol was promised in 86′ that a privatised bus system would lead to progress. This system has had 26 years to prove itself, but it has failed. It is time for a new approach. Profits gained can be ploughed into improving links, making timetable and route information clearer, and most importantly bringing fares down.”\nThe Green Party says it hopes to deliver a joined up transport scheme for Bristol, which will unite the city. Their manifesto pledges efficient, reliable and well connected transport, at an affordable price, to rival systems like Transport For London.\nPlans include improved local rail links, support for the Bristol metro, an emphasis on cycling and walking provision, feasibility studies for ultra light rail, a transport hub at Bristol Temple Meads to simplify connections, and, crucially, the formation of a transport authority in partnership with other neighbouring local authorities to make sure connections into Bristol are similarly of world class standard.",

In 2022, the Council agreed to an inflationary rent rise of 25% to cover the period 2018-2025, but then chose not to implement it.\nGreen councillors successfully called in the decision made by the Mayor before the election and subsequent change of administration earlier this year, in a process they called ‘an absolute shambles’. As a result, the decision was deferred until after the election to be considered by the new Public Health and Communities Policy Committee.\nGreens have said that the decision is positive for the new committee model of governance. Back in March, Cllr Emma Edwards, Leader of the Green group said, “When the city finally gets balanced committees representing all parties elected by residents, the Greens will make sure the committees pick up the pieces and start to listen to the concerns, wisdom, and insight of allotment communities.”\nCllr Fi Hance, who sits on the committee, said: “This proposal is an example of the positive, collaborative and transparent decision making that the new committees are capable of when talking with communities. Today, the new committee-led Council has been able to find a solution where the previous Labour Mayor could not.\n“I would like to praise the work of Stephen Williams, the Chair of this Committee on getting to this point. I would also like to thank groups like Bristol Allotments Resist and the Bristol Allotments Forum for their constructive engagement with this issue. I am looking forward to working with them in the future to make sure that we find an equitable solution that allows us to improve the services they receive while keeping allotments as accessible as we can.”\nUnder the new proposals, the majority of plot holders (band B allotments) will see their rent rise by just £26 a year from £50 to £76. Also for the first time people will be able to pay by direct debit in monthly or quarterly instalments.\nThe new increases will come into effect from late 2025, as per the allotment act, and will also include a requirement for the council to look at another system of calculating rents in a fairer way in the future in consultation with allotment holders.\nThe increased money will allow the council to hire another allotment officer and will also cover £55k of savings that was agreed in the 2022 budget, which would otherwise have to come out of the budget for parks. Greens say this will also protect allotments from private providers.\nCllr Ed Fraser, who also sits on the committee, said: “This fairer deal, which was fought for by the Greens and allotment groups across the city, not only will start to improve the service that we provide to allotment holders, but will also protect funding that is needed for Bristol’s parks and success stories like Blaise Plant Nursery.”\n“Allotments are an invaluable part of the services that the Council provide, and it is vital that we protect them in the interest of the public. Where controversial private companies outside of Bristol are charging £600 a year for allotment plots, we will still be able to provide a similar sized plot for just £76. This decision also means more people will be able to claim discounts and will help the Council move forward with its Food Growing Strategy.”\nNotes:\nFull papers here- ModernGov – bristol.gov.uk\nAbdul was born in Ashley ward and has run his local business on Grosvenor Rd for the last two decades.\nMore about AbdulCllr Emma Edwards is the Leader of the Green Group on Bristol City Council\nMore about Emma",

Safety\nA peer reviewed paper produced by UWE (1) demonstrates that ‘The estimated total number of injuries avoided across the city each year is 4.53 fatal, 11.3 serious, and 159.3 slight injuries.’\nThe graph (7) illustrates this:\n2. Saves money\nThe same report also estimates that ‘The estimated annual saving following the decrease in casualties is £15,256,309’\n3. Cuts speeds\nIt also tells us ‘there was a statistically significant 2.7mph decrease in vehicle speeds’. Average speed decreased on 100 roads out of 106.’\n4. Doesn’t increase and may cut emissions\nIntuitively, it must be obvious to all of us who live in a city that the idea of the ‘open road’ is a myth. Cities are beset with junctions, roundabouts, mini-roundabouts, various crossings, traffic, but above all – an awful lot of other traffic. All of these slow motorists down. Indeed, driving advice is that it is better (more fuel efficient) to drive at a constant slower rate than doing a lot of accelerating and decelerating (2).\n5. It’s good for cyclists and pedestrians\nOne of the most common reasons people give for not cycling is fear of traffic. Clearly part of this is the fear of being hit by vehicles. By slowing down the traffic, you encourage more people to cycle. Likewise, a stream of speeding vehicles can clearly make it harder for pedestrians to cross the road, especially elderly pedestrians.\n6. It’s good for motorists\nLiving Streets (3) suggest ‘drivers cut their spacing as braking distances contract, shorter gaps mean more vehicles use the available road space, reducing standing traffic, and filtering at junctions becomes easier. Also – given lower speeds encourage active travel, the roads become clearer!\n7. It’s good for health\nBecause it encourages active travel (ie cycling and walking), the population as a whole becomes healthier.\n8. Good for the planet\nAnd this should give the planet a better chance in our fight against runaway climate change.\n9. Labour Wales is thinking of doing it….Labour London too!\nA recent report (4) shows the Labour devolved assembly in Wales is considering introducing a blanket zone in built up areas. The world is moving to more people-friendly, family-friendly towns and cities. Another report shows the London mayor is also thinking of doing it (8).\n10. Safer for cyclists\nBristol City Councils own research (5) shows ‘There was a clear reduction in injury odds in 20mph compared to 30mph’ for cyclists\n11. Dangers of higher speeds for pedestrians\nBristol City Councils own research (6) also shows ‘For example, the risk of being killed is almost 5 times higher in collisions between a car and a pedestrian at 50km/h (31mph) compared to the same type of collisions at 30 km/h (18.6mph) reports OECD.’\nWe could go on.\nIn conclusion, we repeat – it is vital that this city maintains its commitment to 20mph, and needs to be looking at ways to improve its effectiveness. We need to move on from a debate about the benefits of lower speeds, and accept them for the success that they are.\nReferences:\nhttp://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/transport-travel/driving-advice\nhttps://www.livingstreets.org.uk/media/3468/review-of-current-practice.pdf",

The bill is currently going through Parliament and includes a controversial clause to prevent councils owning local bus companies.\nEleanor Combley, Green Councillor for Bishopston and Ashley Down said:\n“The bus bill includes good proposals to allow local authorities to set maximum fares, introduce joint tickets and travel zones and set bus timetables. But hidden in the bill is also a disastrous proposal to prohibit local authorities from setting up their own publicly owned bus companies. We support the we own it campaign and their excellent work to get this clause removed.”\n“Greens support public ownership of public services wherever possible. Across the country there are 12 bus companies run by local authorities which provide some of the best services and have some of the highest pus passenger numbers outside London [1]. If the government is serious about devolution and localised decision making then they should drop a clause which could prevent other councils from also providing affordable bus services for local communities.”\nCouncillor Clive Stevens, who has been campaigning on local bus routes said:\nA good local bus service is essential for older people and disabled people. It is also key to reducing traffic congestion and the air pollution this causes, something which affect us all. Across the country private ownership of bus services means that £277 million every year goes to shareholders instead of local authorities.”\nCouncillor Eleanor Combley continued:\n“Mayor of Bristol, Marvin Rees indicated before the election that he was in favour of public ownership of buses. I will therefore be tabling a question to the next Full Council asking him how he plans to fight a clause that would prevent this.

A statement says the event “will convene the various strands of the climate emergency and sustainability space – activists, problem-holders and solution providers – in order to co-design concrete solutions for genuine impact.” The Club of Rome is an international organisation founded in 1968 that consists of current and former world leaders, UN representatives, government officials, experts and business leaders from around the globe. In 1972 it commissioned a well-known report into the limits to growth.\nCouncillor Denyer proposed the initial climate emergency motion at a Bristol Council meeting in November 2018 – it called on the Council to declare a climate emergency and set a target for Bristol to achieve carbon neutrality by 2030, an advance of 20 years on the original objective. Since then over 100 UK local authorities and the London Assembly have followed suit and passed similar motions. The UK parliament also passed a motion on the subject on May 1 2019.\nHowever, in her talk at the international event Cllr Denyer is expected to press for more action from policymakers, calling on politicians from other parties to follow their declarations with ambitious and effective action rather than continuing to pursue policies destructive to the climate.\nCarla said:\n“I am delighted that so many Councils followed my lead in declaring a Climate Emergency. But clearly a declaration on its own is not enough – it is only meaningful if it is followed up with urgent and sustained action. I am worried there is a very real risk of this not happening. Many of the politicians that have made these declarations have not reflected it in their policies and actions, indeed they have pursued policies that are at direct odds with addressing the emergency. In the last few months we have seen Labour, Lib Dem and Conservative politicians granting permission for a new coal mine in Cumbria and supporting airport expansions across the country.\n“Our society has made huge progress in the last 9 months – political leaders of all stripes have shown they are ready to describe the problem honestly, but now we need to find the political will to solve the problem. I hope this London Climate Action Week will be the time that they step up to the challenge.”\nPhoto credit @JonCraig_Photos",

Our membership, now at 70,000 UK-wide, is growing and we’re standing more candidates than ever.\nOur swelling membership, and record showing in pre-general election polls, reflects the fact that people in this country are increasingly sick and tired of business-as-usual politics. The same old tired politics of the same old tired politicians is no longer good enough.\nPeople are turning to us because we offer something unique: hope.\nWhen others wrestle for the mantle of being toughest on migrants, or most willing to make cuts, Greens are putting forward a positive, progressive vision of what Britain could look like.\nI know for the people of Bristol there is no clearer signal of Government failure than the inadequate and overpriced local transport system here. People spend far too much time and money on getting around.\nAnd this Government failure on local transport is an indication of the type of politics we have in this country. Prices of tickets rise faster than wages, private companies make vast profits at the expense of passengers – and people are driven into using their cars to get around – adding to air pollution and climate change emissions because they have no other choice.\nPublic transport is a public good – it should be affordable, reliable and act as an incentive for people to leave their cars at home. But warm words alone won’t build us a local transport system fit for the 21st century.\nThat’s why today I’m pleased to announce our plan to re-regulate the buses.\nOutside London, where private bus operators choose their routes, timetables and fares, with no regulation or fare cap, services have got worse and bus use has gone down by more than 30% since 1986. Over two-thirds of local transport authorities have cut bus services due to local government cutbacks.\nWe will give local authorities the power to regulate bus services – ending two decades of decline in this most vital of public services.\nAnd, with one in five young people in further education considering dropping out because of costs, we are also pledging to make local public transport free for under 18s and students. If we’re serious about tackling climate change, and ending our reliance on car use, then we need to give young people a real incentive to use public transport.\nAnd if we’re serious about making these changes than we need to be honest about how we’re going to pay for them. The Green Party is the only party that’s talking openly and honestly about tax. We’re not ashamed to say that the richest individuals and biggest corporations should be paying more. That’s why we want a higher rate of income tax for the highest earners, it’s why we want a wealth tax on the richest 1% and it’s why we will shut down the tax loopholes that allow big business to get away without paying their fair share.\nBecause we won’t bring about equality in this country, we won’t bring about stronger local communities, and we won’t tackle the vested interests that continue to dictate our politics unless we are bold and honest about who is going to foot the bill.\nAnd it’s this boldness and this willingness to challenge the status quo that runs through the veins of this city – and our candidate here Darren Hall.\nI’m so proud to be standing alongside him here – and to be joining him once again on the campaign trail. Our message today is clear: for a different kind of Britain, for affordable and efficient local transport, for a decent future for young people in this country, and for a real alternative – vote Green on Thursday, and send a message to the Establishment.\n[Speech delivered by Natalie Bennett at 10am Saturday the 2nd of May in Bristol]\n[With thanks to Aaron Chown for providing photos]",

The four Councillors, Stephen Clarke (Southville), Paula O’Rourke (Clifton), Carla Denyer (Clifton Down) and Eleanor Combley (Bishopston & Ashley Down) will be sleeping out at Pip n Jay Church in the centre of Bristol on Friday 24th February.\nLatest official figures show an estimated 4,134 people were forced to sleep outside in 2016, up 16% on the previous year and Bristol having the 5th highest number of rough sleepers outside of London. Last month’s official rough sleeper count in Bristol found 74 people sleeping on the streets although the number is probably higher than that.\nCommenting on the housing crisis in the city, Cllr Carla Denyer, said,\n“As local politicians representing the third largest party on Bristol City Council, we have been working to address the housing crisis in the city, and especially pushing for more affordable housing including through recently putting a motion to council. However, progress has not been fast enough – there are still far too many people sleeping rough every night. So as well as working towards better policies for the long-term, we wanted to do something to support homeless people right now, and raise awareness of the issue.”\nCommenting on spending a winter night sleeping rough, Cllr Paula O’Rourke said,\n“Buying a coffee or giving change to someone begging on the street might help with my own guilt for a while, but the problem is systemic and needs both city and nation-wide solutions.\nThere are young people begging in my ward and they need help to put their lives back together. However, they are deemed not ‘at risk enough’ to be eligible for support from the authorities. As a local councillor I am sick and tired of talking to support organizations who tell me that they don’t have enough money. That is why we need to raise as much as we can whilst also sending a clear message to both the local council and national government that this financial situation is not good enough.”\nCllr Stephen Clarke added,\n“Of course it will be cold for us, but, it is only one night and we will have safety-in-numbers; imagine having to sleep out on your own every night vulnerable. It shouldn’t be happening in the 21st century, let alone in Bristol which is a city that prides itself on compassion and support. Supporting agencies are looking desperately for resources to support people back onto their feet and so we must all do all we can help.”\nThe four councillors have launched a fund-raising page that has already received over £1400.

South West MEP Molly Scott Cato has been working with Green politicians from across Europe to oppose the deal in the European Parliament commented:\n“Over three million European citizens have called for the EU to stop negotiating this trade deal in their name. I would be delighted if Bristol Council added its name to the many opposing TTIP.\nEarlier this year I was allowed to see the “top secret” TTIP documents, which EU citizens have been prevented from seeing, but only after I was required to sign a document swearing me to secrecy. This means I am not allowed to disclose what I have seen. However I can say that the experience did not leave me with any sense of reassurance, either that the process of negotiating this trade deal is democratic, or that the negotiators are operating on behalf of citizens. TTIP is a corporate charter and we must do all we can against this treaty that is a serious threat to our democracy, workers’ rights and our environmental standards.”\nCouncillor McMullen continued: “We feel it is wrong that deals are being made that will restrict national and local government’s ability to conduct its own affairs, and yet no Councillors or MPs are allowed to scrutinise the documents or input into the negotiations”.\nFULL COUNCIL MOTION – 10 NOVEMBER 2015\nThis council notes:\nThis council believes that:\nThis council resolves:\nMotion to be moved by Cllr McMullen\nDate of submission: 30 October 2015\nImage from Federation of European Young Greens",

They’re also offering to give them a lift to the bank to help them cash it in. Labour have surrendered on Brexit with barely a whimper.”\n“People in Bristol West, 80% of who voted to Remain in the European Union, deserve so much better than a weak and divided Labour Party that’s position on one of the most defining political issues of a generation flits between confusion, chaos and capitulation.”\n“Brexit is not inevitable.

The warnings come ahead of the FSB annual conference to be held in Torbay this week.\nThe research has found that one in four small businesses would be deterred from trading with the EU should any tariffs be introduced after Brexit. The government is planning to remove the UK from the single market, which would make tariffs highly likely.

This latest report should ring alarm bells, particularly as there are thousands of small businesses across the South West.\n“We have already learned that a hard Brexit will backfire dramatically. Recent research revealed that regions of the UK that voted strongly for Leave are also those regions with the greatest levels of dependency on European Union markets.

Over 18,000 disabled people in the UK, including over a hundred in Bristol, are only able to live independently by accessing the support they need through the Independent Living Fund (ILF).\nThe Coalition Government’s decision to close the ILF will therefore have seriously repercussions for many of our fellow citizens, denying them the ability to live their lives in the home of their choice, and to actively contribute to their local communities.\nOn Wednesday, the Bristol Green Party will ask the council to vote to ring-fence all funds transferred from the ILF, and to call upon the national leaders of the main political parties to reverse the closure of the ILF. If passed, it is believed that Bristol will become the first city to take an official position against the closure of the ILF.\n“We are calling for the funds that will be transferred locally to be ring-fenced but we also need any future national government to commit to providing the necessary resources to enable disabled citizens to live independently.” said Tony Dyer, the Green Party candidate for Bristol South, “Welfare reform, including changes to incapacity benefit and the introduction of personal independence payments have badly affected many disabled people – they have often borne the brunt of this government’s cuts.\n“Changes to the ILF fund in particular are causing stress for many people who depend on this money for their support needs and who fear that it will be cut” He continued; “Disability rights groups are also concerned that some people who will have been eligible for ILF support have not been able to apply to the fund since it was closed to new applicants and thus we are also calling for the Council to ensure that these people are not forgotten.”\nWhat is the Independent Living Fund?\nThe ILF was originally set up in 1988 as a national resource dedicated to the financial support of disable people, enabling them to choose to live in their communities rather than being forced in to residential care.\nThe ILF is amongst the most efficient of all public sector organisations, with administration costs of just 2% compared to an average of 16% for local authorities. It also has a 98% satisfaction rating amongst its users. In addition, the average weekly ILF fund of £345 to allow disabled people to live at home should be compared with an average weekly cost to the taxpayer of £745 per week to provide residential care.\nDespite this exemplar performance, the Coalition government announced in December 2012 it will close the scheme. This decision was subsequently overturned at the Court of Appeal where a judge found that the decision breached the public sector equality duty. However, the Coalition Government has since repeated its intention to close the fund in June 2015 and transfer its funding responsibilities to local authorities but has only committed to funding local authorities for one year. Meanwhile, in August, the UK appears to have become the first country to be the subject of an investigation by a high level United Nations commission into “grave violations” of the rights of disabled people.\n“I am proud that the Green Party is raising this issue with the Council.” said Rob Telford, Green Party councillor for Ashley. “The UN human rights investigation to find out if Coalition Government policies have led to ‘grave violations’ of the rights of disabled people comes in the wake of studies showing that those with disabilities have been impacted disproportionately by the cuts – almost 20 times as much. Here in Bristol we must aim to do everything we can to ensure disabled people can live independent, dignified lives and be allowed to contribute to our communities. Any effective future solution needs to directly involve disabled people themselves in the decision making process”\nMany of the actions called for by the Greens are based on the concerns raised by Disability Rights UK following responses to Freedom of Information requests sent to all the relevant local authorities. Only 10 local authorities confirmed they were planning to ring-fence ILF transfer funding.",

The recent vote by the European Parliament will result in postponing the auctioning of 900 million allowances, a move which has immediately caused the price of pollution permits to rise.\nLead Green Party European candidate for the South West, Molly Scott Cato, who is also a green economist and contributed to the Stern Review on climate change said:\n“Today’s vote gives us a chance to make the EU’s Emission Trading Scheme work properly. The carbon market has been far too weak and the price of carbon too low. Postponing the auctioning of these permits will allow the crisis-ridden ETS to begin doing it’s job of actually cutting carbon emissions and so tackle climate change. It’s a first step towards recognising that the market cannot solve the problem of climate change and that firm political action is required.”\nThe proposal to postpone the auction of permits passed despite intense lobbying from some of Europe’s most polluting industries. Molly Scott Cato concluded:\n“Let’s hope that this vote paves the way for the Commission to propose some deeper structural reforms to the ETS which enable us to cut our carbon emissions and create decent green jobs across Europe.”\nWhat is the European Union’s Emissions Trading System (ETS)?\nThe ETS is designed to curb carbon emissions by big polluters in the EU, including sectors such as power generators, steel, cement and ceramics manufacturers.\nHow does it work?\nThe ETS is a “cap and trade system”. Countries are given a national allocation of how much carbon dioxide they can emit, which is then divided up among the companies covered by the scheme. If companies emit more than they are allowed they must purchase permits to make up for the excess. If they emit less, they can sell their unused allocations.\nFurther details: http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/jan/04/emissionstrading.carbonemissions\nAndrew Bell, SW Green Party Press Officer abell@phonecoop.coop 07903 932220\nMolly Scott Cato molly@gaianeconomics.org 07890 832891",

These devastating cuts to vital council services are not something that Greens can support.”\n“Thanks to a Green amendment, adult social care will be receiving an additional £3.5 million funding this year for care homes, disability services and home care services, but even so, the overall funding gap for these services continues to increase.”\n“As far as the overall budget is concerned, the Green’s don’t believe that most people want a society where their local council cannot afford to pay for care of older and disabled people, maintain our streets or pay for basic services.”\n“These cuts are being presented by government as inevitable, but they are not; they are an ideological choice by the Tories. It is George Osborne who has chosen to slash public spending and force those on the lowest incomes to pay the brunt of bankers’ excesses. Instead, those best able to pay should be asked to foot the bill through fairer taxation and by cracking down on tax avoidance by big business.”",

Molly Scott Cato, who is also the Greens’ Parliamentary candidate for Bristol West, commented:\n“This is another tactical mistake from the PM, implying that Bristol supported her plans for hard Brexit. Added to her previous false suggestions that the whole country agrees with her this gaffe further alienates those who did not vote to Leave the EU. Showing a Totterdown street in a ward that voted overwhelmingly to remain as part of a pro-Brexit film is no way to bring the country together. Only by accepting that there are different views and by negotiating a future that works for everybody can she hope to heal the divisions Brexit has caused in our country.\n“We are well aware of May’s plan for Britain: it’s a race to the bottom on environmental and social standards in return for trade of any kind, seemingly with anyone, and that’s why she must know that she will meet resistance. This bitterly damaging approach to government is rooted in untruths. A so-called hard Brexit, with all the damage leaving the single market will cause, is far from inevitable. Many in Bristol would share my view that Mrs May does not have the support she needs to push ahead with a hard Brexit by diktat.\n“Meanwhile, the rest of us are left to defend our rights, and we will do that – united, and within the democracy that defines our country. It’s time to come together and debate our shared future, not be pushed around by a narrow ideology that only responds to a minority view.”",

The change of view by a major stakeholder is particularly significant as the Airport’s expansion plans, having been rejected by North Somerset on 11 February, are currently being reviewed by the planning inspectorate following an appeal by the airport.\nThe decision has been described by activists as a test case, as Bristol Airport is the first of many regional airports planning expansion, and also represents a test of the government’s commitment to carbon targets under the Paris accords. The Green motion states that “that airport expansion is incompatible with Bristol, the West of England and the region’s carbon reduction targets and therefore must not go ahead.” [full text in notes below]\nBristol Green Councillor Steve Clarke played an important role in the initial campaign against airport expansion, working with activists and councillors across multiple councils, and proposed the motion at this afternoon’s meeting. He said:\n“I’m delighted by tonight’s news, it’s great that we’ve been able to persuade the Labour Administration to change its position on this. It shows the value of having elected Greens in the Council to speak up for our climate commitments. It’s quite simple really – if a Council supports airport expansion, which will cause over one million tonnes more carbon dioxide emissions, it is not taking the climate emergency seriously. As the motion notes, I will be writing a letter to the planning inspectorate formally opposing the airport’s appeal and expect the Mayor to support this.”\nCouncillor Jerome Thomas, the other proposer of the motion, added:\n“Tonight’s news is really significant – the Airport’s expansion is the biggest carbon decision for the region in decades, and Bristol Council has now sent a strong message that Bristol Airport expansion must not go ahead. There was a lot of work behind the scenes to ensure Labour’s cooperation and I’m glad we could eventually agree on wording that still changes our council’s position on this issue.”\nNotes\nTo build pressure on the WECA and Bristol Mayors to oppose Bristol Airport’s expansion, please sign and share this petition.\nThe Green motion was amended by a Labour amendment. Green councillors supported this amendment, in order to ensure that the motion would pass. The Greens worked with Labour ahead of the meeting to find wording both parties could agree on.\nGreen councillors said they were prepared to cooperate in this way because the revised motion still opposes airport expansion, noting that it is incompatible with carbon reduction targets “and therefore must not go ahead”. The revised motion also calls on the Mayor to support councillors lobbying the planning inspector to ask them not to overturn North Somerset’s rejection.",

They have also suggested an amendment to the bill to reduce the number of people claiming homelessness duties. (1)\nThe intervention follows stark warnings that the rising cost of homelessness, which councils bear through a duty to provide temporary accommodation, is leading some local authorities to effective bankruptcy and could spell “the end of local government”.(2) In 2023/24 councils in England are expected to spend £2 billion on temporary accommodation. (3)\nThe end of private tenancies is a major cause of homelessness. Official statistics released last month, which highlighted significant increases in rough sleeping, showed that a quarter of eligible claims for homelessness support were due to the end of an assured shorthold (private rented) tenancy. (4) The biggest cause of homelessness claims for private renters was eviction due to landlords wishing to sell the property,(5) which made up 40% of all eligible claims. Eviction for this reason will continue to be possible after the Renters (Reform) Bill has been passed.\nThe Renters (Reform) Bill abolishes section 21 ‘no-fault’ evictions, but landlords will still be able to evict tenants by providing an approved reason, such as for family to move in or to sell the property. In these instances, the Bill retains the two-month notice period which many renters currently struggle with; research by Shelter found that over a third of tenants take longer than this to find a new home. (8)\nBy extending this to four months, Bristol Greens say renters will have “more security and time to find a new home which suits their needs”, which will “reduce the number of people claiming homelessness support following the end of a private tenancy, lessening the impact of evictions on local government finances.”\nCllr Lisa Stone, who put the letter together, said: “In Bristol, landlords have used section 21 to threaten tenants with eviction unless extortionate rent increases are agreed to.”\n“We urge the Secretary of State to do everything he can to make sure the bill is amended and put into force as soon as possible. We also ask him to make sure that following the Bill’s passing, section 21 evictions are abolished as soon as possible for new and existing tenancies.”\nCllr Carla Denyer, Co-Leader of the national Green Party, said: “It comes as a surprise to no-one to see the Government buckling to pressure from backbenchers to water down and delay this bill. Not least when almost a third of those backbenchers are landlords themselves.” (9)\nSources:",

The motion follows controversy over a planned development for 135 houses in the Chocolate Factory in Easton, which was deferred by councillors on the planning committee over concerns about the lack of affordable housing and a number of other recent schemes which have offered very little affordable housing.\nGreen councillor Stephen Clarke, who tabled the motion said:\n“I am delighted that council agreed this motion which was proposed by the Green group and supported by Labour amendments. Everyone talks about the need for affordable housing and the 10,000 people on the council’s housing list and the numbers of people sleeping rough are evidence of the problems. Bristol’s own Mayor Marvin Rees pledged to build 800 a year for example, but for this to be possible we need an urgent change in how our housing system works. At the moment it is all too easy for developers to fail to deliver the council’s own affordable housing target of 30%-40% by saying that if they build affordable homes their scheme won’t make enough profit. The viability process – on which these decisions are made has been too secretive and should be entirely public. This motion will help to make that happen.”\nThe Green Party have called for half a million homes to be available for social rent by 2020 across the country. This would cost £27 billion over the course of the parliament which could be paid for by increasing Government spending on social housing by £4.5 billion a year and removing the cap on what local authorities can borrow to build new housing. Increased government spending would be paid for by scrapping mortgage interest tax allowance (worth around £5.8 billion a year) and reforming other landlord tax allowances.\nCouncillor Clive Stevens who also spoke said:\n“It is clear the affordable housing system doesn’t work, even the planning officers say its broken. I agree with them. Some of the change needed is national but there is much we can do in Bristol with good leadership and targeted effort. If asked, I’d love to help get the affordable housing process working again and if it needs banging a few heads together then I’m up for that”\nThe leader of the Green group Councillor Charlie Bolton said\n“I am pleased that this motion has passed, despite opposition from Conservative councillors, and hope that we can really have some action on affordable housing. We know that the housing crisis is a national, not just a local issue, but we need strong leadership from our city leaders and we hope that this motion can assist that process. After all everyone has the right to a decent home.”\nImage: Councillor Stephen Clarke proposes the Green affordable housing motion",

Darren said,\n“Tackling our housing crisis is one of my top priorities. The Centre for Cities suggestion that building on our greenbelt is the only solution is just plain wrong. First and foremost we have to focus on affordability, and it is a fallacy that building more ‘des res’ on the outskirts of Bristol & Bath will fix that.\nBy concentrating on high-quality social housing provided through community development initiatives backed by the best in the building industry, we can act quickly to provide homes that those most in need can afford, rather than relying on the same system that created the housing crisis to fix it. Volume housebuilders like green field sites because they can make more profit, but even the relatively well paid can no longer afford to get on the housing ladder without an eye-watering mortgage and government help for the deposit. This just continues to fuel the problem, not solve it.\nAt the same time we can also lift thousands of families out of fuel poverty, using cost-effective techniques to reduce energy bills to near zero, and even generating and storing renewable energy on site. Centre for Cities rightly say we need to raise the profile of Bristol & Bath, but I want the West of England to become a world leader in new build and retrofit homes fit for the future, not be the city that people cite as the least affordable in the UK outside of London\n“Of course, most of our houses are already built, so we must also end exploitive letting fees and introduce a ‘Living Rent’ that is no more than a third of someone’s income. We need a region wide Renter’s Charter like Acorn’s in Bristol, that sets out strong guideline for homes across the West of England that will protect tenants from some landlords who are out to exploit them.”\nI really don’t believe that the Conservatives have any intention of helping those most in need and are only worried now because the so-called JAMs are struggling to keep a roof over their heads. Successive government’s have all ducked the real issue of providing public sector land for social housing that can benefit people in the longer term, rather than just being sold off to the highest bidder who has no intention of providing affordable housing.”\nThe South West’s Green MEP, Molly Scott Cato said,\n“The last thing we need is a free-for-all development on our precious Green spaces. The prospect offered by European law represents a significant threat to our environment which is why the Green Party is proposing an Environmental Protection act with a court to ensure the government can be held accountable after Brexit.”\nThe Centre for Cities proposal to allow developer-led housing on the greenbelt would just add to those risks and would lead to developments dominated by excessive profits rather than those who need homes.”",
  "https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_/https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_darren-hall-protects-our-nhs/content_906.html": "The opening statements allowed candidates to outline their party’s position on the NHS. The incumbent Liberal Democrat, Stephen Williams, was a notable no-show – his empty chair perhaps symbolic of his position in the race in Bristol West, and of the Liberal Democrat’s usual approach to honouring commitments.\nLabour could offer only tweaks and half-measures with candidate, Thangam Debbonaire, rather puffing herself out with talk of profit caps and a promise to repeal the Health and Social Care Act. Contrastingly, Darren Hall offered a composed yet stirring opening: the Green Party will remove the profit motive entirely from the NHS and put an end to the costly disaster of PFI. He outlined the Green Party NHS rescue plan, to not only repeal the Health and Social Care Act immediately, but to oppose the threat of TTIP in all its forms, and to support the campaign for an NHS Reinstatement Bill that will return the NHS to its rightful owners.\nThe open format allowed an immediate question from the floor, challenging establishment rhetoric that there is ‘no money in the pot’, pointing to the £100 billion cost of Trident, as well as the money that is miraculously found for costly and unjust wars. Unsurprisingly the Labour and Conservative candidates towed their party lines to renew Trident, declared ‘militarily useless’ by the ex-commander of the Navy. Green Party candidate Darren Hall distinguished himself, articulating clearly the Green Party’s total opposition to Trident. Darren further called for an end to the brainwashing of the austerity agenda. Debt currently stands at 90% of GDP, yet when the NHS was first created after WWII debt stood at 250%. Darren asserted that it is pure myth that there is no money, to loud cheers and applause from the audience. Investing in our health service by creating fairer taxation is economical in the long-term and is Green Party policy.\nOne questioner presented the tricky question of how the NHS can be improved aside from simply hurling money at it. Whilst many of the candidates talked about the need for more transparency, it was not clear how their parties would tackle this. Darren Hall was clear on the need to tackle vested interests, pointing out the huge numbers of Tory and Labour MPs and peers who stand to personally benefit from the private healthcare sector (link to report). He also focused on where funds are allocated – 95% of the health budget is currently spent on an illness service – much more needs to be allocated for prevention.\nOn the subject of NHS staffing, one questioner pointed to the heavy dependence of the NHS on staff from countries across the world, challenging the UKIP candidate, as well as Labour’s apparent pandering to UKIP on this, especially in light of the Labour Party ‘Controls on Immigration‘. Darren Hall offered a welcome relief from this culture of fear, pointing out that 1 in 7 people globally are now migrants, and that migration has a net positive effect for the UK. Rather than being afraid of our neighbours we need to understand that we exist as part of a migratory system and need to engage and move forwards positively.\nAnother area of concern was that of mental health, with one questioner asking when it will be treated as a ‘normal illness’ and given the investment it needs. Darren highlighted the injustice that someone with a mental illness has a 28% chance of receiving treatment, whereas a person with diabetes has a 95% chance. Reflecting on his experience as a Samaritan, Darren identified talking therapies as effective and inexpensive. Yet instead of investing in these low-cost early intervention measures, the coalition government’s austerity programme has made particularly deep cuts to mental health community services over the past five years. The Conservative candidate’s defence rang hollow as she applauded her party for the lip service it has paid to recognising mental health as equal to physical, but simultaneously acknowledging ‘that’s not the best answer, but that’s me’.\nAs the Conservative and Labour candidates made their closing statements, audience members heckled more of their empty rhetoric. Darren was the last to speak and was able to offer a final message of hope, of a more equal society where wellbeing is valued, promoted through access to green environments and working systems of transport, and backed up by the reinstatement of a world-class NHS. The audience applauded, seemingly concurring that, whilst the Greens may not be about to run this country, one more Green voice in parliament is one sure step in the right direction.\n[With thanks to Bharat Kunwar for providing photos for this event]",

Bristol’s new waste and resource management strategy, which will be discussed by cabinet next week, makes reducing the amount of food waste we chuck in the bin a top priority.\nLong term campaigner on reuse and recycling, Councillor Martin Fodor said:\n“We have to make it as easy as possible for everyone to reuse, recycle and compost as much as they can. We have made a great start as a city, but we have to step up our game to get more people involved. Any food waste going into bins is a waste of resources, and also a cause of methane and pollution from landfills. It’s only if people take steps to compost it or get the council to treat the waste that these resources can be put back to use fertilising soil or creating energy.”\nGreen Assistant Mayor in charge of waste, Daniella Radice said:\n“In Bristol food waste makes up 40% of the waste going into our black bags. Much of this food waste is avoidable. Every year families in the UK waste £700 throwing away food, mainly because they made too much or haven’t eaten it in time. This is why the council has been running the ‘Feed Me and Win’ competition, where people are rewarded for using food recycling bins.”\n“Bristol’s new waste and resource management strategy makes increasing food waste recycling a key priority. It also proposes a new vision for how we use our resources and think about waste. It is irresponsible to use vast amounts of energy and resources producing products which are then just chucked into landfill. Instead we need a duel approach of preventing and reducing the waste we produce and then repairing, re-using, recycling and composting as much waste as possible.”",
  "https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_/https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_greens-demand-retention-of-pollution-monitoring-sites/content_921.html": "menu\nThe Green Party is demanding the retention of air pollution monitoring sites in Bristol. This follows a DEFRA consultation which campaigners fear may lead to the loss of such sites. Organisations – such as ‘Clean Air in London’ have pointed out that ‘DEFRAs plans would result inevitably in the scrapping of thousands of local monitoring sites’. Greens regard adequate monitoring as a vital part of fighting the devastating effect that air pollution causes.\nIn 2014, Bristol City Council commissioned a report to examine the impact of air quality on the health of people in Bristol. The report concludes that an additional 188 deaths of Bristol residents (over the age of 30) were attributable to air pollution in 2010, with 24 of these attributable to local road traffic emissions. This compares to an average of 9 people killed each year in road traffic collisions on roads in Bristol. There were also 52 respiratory hospital admissions and 42 cardiovascular hospital admissions attributable to air pollution in Bristol. The cost of these health effects attributable to air pollution in Bristol is calculated to be £83 million per year (at 2013 prices).\nAccording to the consultation, DEFRA is planning to ‘refocus’ Local Air Quality Management’ away from monitoring towards reducing air pollution. Superficially, this may sound like a good thing, but in practice, it is vital to carry out adequate levels of monitoring. We need to know how bad the pollution is and where it is in order to remedy it. It is not either-or, but both.\nCouncillor Charlie Bolton said\n“Air pollution leads to at least 29,000 early deaths a year in the UK and possibly many more. In Bristol it is estimated that nearly 200 people died (in 2010). It causes heart attacks, strokes, cancer and worsens a wide range of respiratory diseases. n order to be able to effectively address it, a basic thing we need to do is monitor it properly”.\nDarren Hall, the Green Party’s candidate for Bristol West said: ‘Businesses often say ‘If you can’t measure it, you can’t manage it’. We have rigorous tests to make sure we can drink clean water, and we have to be just as sure the air we breathe is safe as well. Relaxing standards on air quality makes it even more of an invisible issue. It is an underhand way of achieving short term savings, but at the expense of long term costs to the NHS. We all have a right to clean air.”\nDeb Joffe, who is widely tipped to take Windmill Hill for the Greens in the next election – and is also a former nurse & midwife said:\n“Air pollution poses considerable risks to children, especially those with existing lung disease, which can include those born prematurely. There is also some evidence that pregnant women are affected and those living in areas of high pollution are more likely to have low birth weight babies.”\nGreens have submitted a motion to Bristol City Council asking the mayor to oppose the possible loss of sites. While it is unlikely to be taken, it is part of an on-going Green campaign to improve air quality in the city of Bristol.

Moving from partial to full divestment is a big step forward for the university, with plans being put in place to ditch all fossil fuel companies from its investment portfolio over the next couple of years.\nBristol is the 10th Russell Group university and 62nd UK university to fully divest from the fossil fuel industry, following in the footsteps of Edinburgh last month. The People & Planet-led Fossil Free campaign has held an active society in Bristol since 2014, and had already achieved huge success – last year, the university pledged to divest from all companies who derived more than 5% of their revenue from the fossil fuel industry by 2018, bringing investments down considerably. The University of Bristol could also become the first Russell Group university to complete the process of full divestment, with officials projecting that this could potentially be achieved by 2020.\nRobert Kerse, Finance Director for the university, said “We’ve made a commitment to completely withdraw our investment from companies which support the fossil fuel industry by March 2020. It’s an ambitious timescale but we realise the importance of swift action to combat climate change.”\nThe 2017 agreement also promised the investment of £3 million in a ‘green’ fund, as well as a ‘material reduction’ in investments in coal and tar sands. However, this was small fry for the university’s Fossil Free society. Since September 2017, they have made it clear that nothing but full divestment would be acceptable to the students of Bristol.\nPapatya O’Reilly, Fossil Free society president, said ‘It fills me with pride to know that our University is playing its part in the Fossil Free movement. So many institutions have divested now that it has become mainstream, yet its impact is undeniable. Divesting is a powerful way of showing solidarity with frontline communities, whose exposure to fossil fuels takes its daily toll on their crops, health, and liberty. Now, we call on all other Universities to follow Bristol’s lead. Join us in preventing climate destruction, in moving our economics and culture towards a sustainable future, and in ensuring a just transition for those bearing the brunt.’ Papatya will be graduating with an undergraduate degree in English and Philosophy this year, and will go on to work as a Trustee for People & Planet.\nGreen Councillor Carla Denyer, who first tabled a motion calling for divestment to the university’s advisory body, the University of Bristol Court, back in 2015 said:\n“After years of campaign work from students, staff, politicians and alumni it’s fantastic to see a real commitment to full divestment from Bristol University. It just goes to show the impact that ordinary people can have through acting together and keeping up the pressure on big institutions.”\n“I am proud to live in a city where, because of the hard campaign work of so many people, both our Council and the University of Bristol have committed to fossil fuel divestment. Following this success, Green Councillors will also continue to focus on increasing the pressure on the Avon Pension Fund to follow suit and commit to full divestment too.”\nThe move to full divestment from the university administration came as something of a surprise; up until recently, Bristol held the position that it would be capable of having influence over the inner workings of energy companies as shareholders – in other words, the financial department seemed to think it would be able to persuade such companies to invest in green energy from the inside. However, following action taken by Bristol students representing the Fossil Free movement, this position was understood to be untenable.\nPeople & Planet’s Fossil Free Campaigns Coordinator, Chris Saltmarsh, said ‘Bristol’s full divestment after a powerful student campaign is another hammer blow to the fossil fuel industry haemorrhaging its social license to operate. 2018 has already seen Huddersfield, Sussex, Edinburgh, Anglia Ruskin, Durham and Cardiff divest millions from this terminally declining rogue industry. It’s time for our banks like Barclays and the UK Government to take our students’ and universities’ lead and exile fossil fuels from our economic and political life.”\nThis latest university divestment is proof of an ever-growing divestment movement throughout the UK, and an approaching end to the suffocating fossil fuel industry.",

On one hand this is very encouraging as it means people are more likely to be part of the solution, but on the other hand it drives home that we absolutely need enough time to reduce any risk to libraries and make a success of people’s good ideas.”\nFollowing a public consultation. Libraries in Westbury-on-Trym, Redland, Marksbury Road, Eastville, Clifton, Wick Road, Brislington, and Sea Mills were all put at risk of closure in the cabinet report by officers at Bristol City Council.\nDaniella has reacted with disappointment to accusations from Liberal Democrat and Conservative MP’s and Councillors that the proposals came from her.\nDaniella said; “The budget cuts imposed as part of the Lib Dem-Tory coalition’s austerity agenda mean local government is facing huge challenges just to keep services running. This was the context in which officers produced the report on the future of Bristol’s library service. Like many of the residents I have spoken to, I want a well-resourced library service in this city. In short, I want more money for libraries. Libraries are the cornerstone of a society that recognises thevalue of free learning for all. I have never proposed library closures. I am opposed to library closures and I will fight alongside my party to stop them.”\nDarren Hall, Green Party parliamentary candidate for Bristol West said; “Whilst the coalition government continue to pursue ideologically driven cuts at national level, their councillors recoil when they see the impact on their local communities. A future Tory government will cut a further £25 billion from public expenditure. Labour have signed up to the same spending plans. Neither has said it will invest more in local government. Trying to redirect blame for the cuts onto those who are most fiercely resisting them is the kind of cynical and disingenuous politics that is driving people away from the old parties.”",

It would also open up the NHS to more privatisation at a time when it is already under attack from government policies. And the creation of closed courts allowing corporations to sue governments when laws get in the way of profits is profoundly undemocratic.\n“Supporters of TTIP claim that removing regulation would create growth and jobs. But freeing corporations to act in their own self-interest has been tried, tested and failed. This approach has widened the gap between the rich and the poor and fuelled a race to the bottom. Tax avoidance and zero-hours contracts are just two examples of what happens when you hand increasing amounts of power to big companies.\n“I fully expected the Conservatives to support TTIP, and it is no longer a surprise that the Liberal Democrats have bought into a misguided free market argument in order to side with them. The real surprise is that even Labour have been taken in by the lobbying and been dazzled by big business.\n“We need a new and inventive way of structuring markets so they work for the common good.

Ani Stafford-Townsend won the ward with 38% of the vote, unseating then incumbent Liberal Democrat Alex Woodman, who slipped to 3rd. Ani also went on to take over from Alex as Chair for Development & Control Committee B.\nCabot was considered a Liberal Democrat stronghold, having been consistently held by the Party ever since George Ferguson first won it as a Liberal in 1973. The Greens will be looking to retain their 1,200 majority.\nSince becoming Cabot Councillor in May, Ani has established a regular surgery in Waring, Underdown & Francombe House in Redcliffe [1], and is working with residents to establish a youth club in the area. Social and affordable housing provision are issues Ani is keen to continue working on. In particular, Ani is pushing the Council to better enforce its policy of new developments having a minimum of 40% affordable housing.\nHomelessness is a major issue in the centre, and Ani has been working with Council agencies on what remains a challenging area.

Bristol has a mass of engineering and renewable energy expertise. This is a natural aim, which marries up the resources available across the south west with our people potential. “\nThe Green Party’s local manifesto lays out plans to improve home insulation across the city, saving local people money on fuel bills; invest in micro generation schemes including solar, ground-source heat pumps and anaerobic digesters; and work with other local authorities to establish a nation wide network to bulk-buy renewable energy. This strategy would work alongside existing council schemes.\nMs Radice is also keen to boost proposals for large scale renewable energy projects at Avonmouth and in the Bristol channel:\n“We need to work on an international stage to attract market leaders in renewable energy generation. Though the city does not have the money to directly fund these large off-site projects, we can work closely with industry and neighbouring authorities to find private and public funding to make best use of our wind and tidal potential.”\nMs Radice’s plans place on emphasis on off shore wind developments, but she is keen also to look into on shore wind, solar and tidal lagoons.\nBristol based renewable energy specialist Carla Denyer, is supportive of Daniella Radice’s goals:\n“We have an impending energy crisis on our hands in the UK. With old power stations getting ready to close, and fossil fuels that will get more expensive as there are less of them, there is still a very real possibility that the lights will go out. We must avoid that, and Daniella’s policies reflect a uniquely fair and people-centred way of doing it. Communities and regions working together to generate their own renewable energy is the only way to break free from the ‘Big Six’ energy companies, and the false impression of choice between them, as they are all motivated by profit, not people’s well-being.”\nNotes:\n1.Daniella Radice, the Green Mayoral Candidate is an environmental specialist who has worked in the waste industry and for Network Rail.

At the meeting there were over 120 statements against airport expansion, including a statement from MEDACT Bristol representing over 100 local doctors opposed to the expansion.\nDuring the meeting Mayor attempted to argue the Airport expansion was not his decision to take but as a major stakeholder the Mayor and Bristol Council have influence in their views on the matter. Other councils and council leaders in the region have come out against the expansion of the Airport (e.g. Weston Council).\nThe Green motion was proposed by Green Councillor Steve Clarke, who also asked Mayor Rees about his position on airport expansion during Members Forum at the beginning of the meeting. In response the Mayor said “my position is that Bristol Airport should be allowed to expand in a context of increasing global passenger numbers”.\nResponding outside the meeting to the Mayor’s answer, Cllr Clarke said:\n“The Mayor is happy to ’talk the talk’ on climate change but he seems to be trying once again to ignore the biggest carbon decision in the region; the proposed expansion of Bristol Airport. The extra carbon produced by the expansion alone will be almost as much as the whole emissions of Bristol.”\n“This is a Climate Emergency and the people in Bristol have a right to ask for leadership and action on climate change rather than excuses. Over 4000 individuals and most of the nearby communities have formally objected; he should follow their example at once.”\nLeader of the Green Group, councillor Eleanor Combley said:\n“The Council has accepted there’s a Climate Emergency but when push comes to shove the Mayor sides with the airport’s shareholders instead of local people and the planet. This is exactly what environmental campaigners like Greta Thunberg mean when they accuse politicians of ‘empty words’ on climate change.”\nReacting to the events in the Council meeting, Councillor Clarke added:\n“It’s a disgrace that councillors voted against the extra time needed to debate this crucial issue, particularly as this could be our last chance before the key vote at North Somerset Council. Blocking climate action is what I’ve come to expect from the Tories but it’s depressing to see Labour councillors line up alongside them to block Green action yet again and take the side of big polluters over people and the planet.”",

Fracking accelerates climate change, puts local communities at risk from dangerous pollutants and increases our dependence on fossil fuels.”\nIn September 2013 Bristol Greens councillors took a motion to Full Council opposing fracking. Whenever and wherever Greens are elected they oppose fracking. Green MP Caroline Lucas not only forced a debate on fracking in Parliament, but also was arrested after taking part in a peaceful local protest against fracking.\nAni Stafford-Townsend continued:\n“Fracking is reckless and unnecessary. A recent report ‘The Power to Transform the South West’ from Green MEP Molly Scott Cato shows that across the South West of England we can generate 100% of our energy needs through renewable energy alone. As a former Green capital, Bristol must play a lead role in developing the South West as a hub of renewable energy generation.”\n“Greens are unequivocally in support of a frack-free Bristol, and we will do everything we can to oppose fracking in and around Bristol in the future. It is good to hear that the Bristol Port Company are prevented by contract from applying for a fracking licence and we hope that other companies will take note of the strength of feeling against fracking. For anyone considering applying for a fracking licence in Bristol in the future we have only one message – frack off!”",

Labour also put forward 10 other amendments that were voted down.\nCllr Emma Edwards, Leader of the Green Group said; “This budget is only the first step for our administration, and I am proud of all those who have input into what is a landmark budget for Bristol.\n“However, I am disappointed that Labour continue to refuse to take part in the committee system and instead have made a mockery of this budget process with amendments of mismatched ideas, which don’t add up, or haven’t been thought through or scrutinised.\n“Rather than take part in cross-party decision making, they have chosen a role of obstructive, attention-grabbing opposition and I am disappointed that they are more interested in grabbing headlines than working together for the people of Bristol.\n“But while we have set this budget today, the work does not stop here. By working together, we will achieve more for the city, we will work better and garner more trust and confidence from those who elected us, regardless of political party.

Too many high rise flat owners have been saddled with fear and uncertainty over who will pay for hazardous cladding to be replaced in the wake of the Grenfell tragedy six years ago.\n“Downing Street has now demolished Housing Secretary Michael Gove’s promise to do away with what he described as ‘feudal’ leaseholds [2], leaving millions of homeowners trapped.\n“By abolishing leasehold in favour of ‘commonhold’ – a system widely used in other countries – we would democratise ownership and allow people to make joint decisions about what should happen in shared areas of flats and housing complexes.\n“People could come together and choose their own management company, set their own service charges and take control of decisions around where they live.\n“Between 2018 and 2020, the Law Commission produced a series of reports [4] calling for changes, but the government has largely offered warm words without substantial reform. We say it is time to act now for up to 10 million people who could have a better future.”\nMartin Madera, a leaseholder in the Hotwells & Harbourside area of Bristol, has seen his building insurance shoot up from under £1,000 a year in 2020/21 to over £2,600 a year now and is battling to get the property’s owners to commit to fully replace hazardous cladding.\nMartin says: “Leasehold is a nightmare – we cannot place building insurance ourselves despite paying for 100% of it and we cannot replace our managing agents unless the freeholder agrees. We even have very little say over the contract for essential remediation work that will be carried out on our home.\n“I’m stunned that none of this was pointed out to me when I bought the property in 2010. We need fundamental reforms and we need them without delay.”\nNotes\n1. Owners of long leasehold properties do not own the property outright – they are in a landlord and tenant relationship with the freeholder. The rights and obligations of the respective parties are governed by the terms of the lease agreement, supplemented by statutory provisions. Essentially, long leaseholders buy the right to live in the property for a given period.\nThe Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities estimates there are 4.86 million leasehold homes in England, of which 69% are flats and 31% are houses. The majority of flats in the private sector are leasehold (an estimated 95% of owner-occupied flats and 70% of privately rented flats).

Greens want to see the franchise brought back into public ownership when the current one expires in 2015 and are highly critical of government plans to grant First Great Western, the group currently running the franchise, an uncompeted extension of up to five years.\nRecently elected Green MEP for the South West, Molly Scott Cato, who set up a petition calling for the Great Western franchise to be taken back into public ownership [2] said:\n“We don’t see how offering an extension to First Great Western on a plate is going to benefit the travelling public. With regular overcrowding, some of the highest fares in Europe, often poor weekend and evening service frequencies and difficult or impossible connections with other rail or bus services, the end of the First franchise provides a fantastic opportunity to take back Great Western into public ownership, get our railways back on track and working for the common good. Instead the government plans to squander this opportunity and continue with profiteers business as usual on our railways.”\nThe Green Party is committed to returning the rail system back into public ownership as franchises come to an end, taking them away from the private rail operators that they say have prioritised share holder dividends over providing a well run rail network. Greens argue that the period from 2015 – 2020 in which there will be major investment, but also major disruption across the Great Western franchise area, is an ideal opportunity for the franchise to be operated instead by Directly Operated Railways (DOR). They say this should follow the successful East Coast Mainline model that has delivered £600 million to the Treasury, increased passenger numbers, and consistently scored highly in surveys on passenger satisfaction. Greens say public ownership could save taxpayers an estimated £1 billion a year, prioritise rather than shareholders and lead to lower fares and better services.\nResponding to the consultation, South West Green Party has called for much bolder levels of investment in and expansion of the railways across the region with new lines and stations, the reopening of old lines, a new Bristol metro service and far more extensive electrification than is currently planned. Again, they argue, this is more likely to happen under public ownership.\nGreens also say taking back the Great Western franchise into public ownership would be an extremely popular move. They point to an opinion poll published by YouGov which found two thirds of the public want the railways renationalised [3] and the fact that 61 MPs, including Green MP Caroline Lucas, have backed an Early Day Motion calling for the railways to be publically owned and run.

Meadows are often overlooked as habitat and are often considered prime development land, which is why wildflower meadows are now one of the rarest habitats in the UK.”\n“We must make space for nature in our city, and that means protecting and enhancing the existing sites we have. We should be investing in nature at this site, not looking to pave it over.”\nPlans to protect the site were previously supported by all political parties, including the former Labour Mayor of Bristol Lord Rees, and Labour MP Kerry McCarthy, but the Labour Government are ignoring these local voices and forcing through plans to develop the site.\nCllr Jenny Bartle, Vice- chair of the Economy and Skills Policy Committee, said “Nature and community spaces should not have to pay the price of decades of poor housing policy that continues under this Labour Government.\n“The Green Party believes that prioritising brownfield sites and vacant buildings is a better strategy for resolving the housing crisis in a sustainable way.\n“If the government was truly serious about resolving the housing crisis, they would look to enable us as a council to develop more social housing through these means, rather than tarmacking over valuable sites for both nature and the local community.”\n“Labour sold this land for development, and while they U-turned publicly, the decision to continue to develop on this land shows that they are clearly unserious about its commitments to climate and nature. ”\n“We urge the government in the strongest possible terms to listen to their own Minister and other local representatives and abandon their plans to develop this site.”",

Full Council voted for a motion1 put forward by Green Party councillors at tonight’s Full Council meeting. A petition and many statements from the public were also tabled in support of the motion, which calls for Bristol City Council to take the lead in calling for the fund to develop a strategy to divest from fossil fuels. Bristol City Council and its neighbouring authorities have seats on the Avon Pension Fund Committee, in which Council employees’ pensions are invested.\nGreen Councillor for Redland, Martin Fodor who tabled the motion said:\n“I am delighted that the council will be taking a lead in calling for Avon Pension fund to become ‘fossil free’ and diversify into renewables and energy efficiency. We are proud of the Council’s commitment earlier this year not to invest in any fossil fuel industries2, and it’s now time for our pension funds to follow suit.”\n“There is a growing realisation that divesting from fossil fuels is not just good for the environment, it is a sound financial judgement too. Investment in the fossil fuel industry is increasingly risky given that the sector is likely to fall in value – sooner rather than later. This is a view shared by Mark Carney, Government of the Bank of England3 and Sir Nicholas Stern, former Chief economist of the World Bank. 75% of fossil fuels need to stay in the ground to avoid dangerous climate change4. This means that fossil fuel industries are not only causing untold damage, but are on the way out and now is the time to invest in alternatives.”\nMark Hubbard chair of Bristol UNISON, who recently voted to support fossil free pensions said:\n“Bristol UNISON has 5,000 members working in Bristol City Council and hundreds of community organisations. Our members want their pension investments to be green and sustainable.”\nGreen Councillor for Clifton East, Carla Denyer, who has also been actively campaigning to get the University of Bristol to go fossil free5, including tabling a motion to the University’s governance body said:\n“Divesting from fossil fuels is good for the environment and also good for all of us who want a safe and secure pension in the future.

Green MP Caroline Lucas has strongly opposed the sell-off of the GIB and Lib Dems and Labour have also voiced opposition. In particular, concerns have been raised about preferred bidder, Australian investment bank Macquarie, over its track record of asset-stripping.\nThe MEPs also express fears that EIB investment could decline dramatically after the UK exits the EU, if the UK ceases to be a shareholder in the EIB. Currently, only EU member states can be EIB shareholders. The UK relies heavily on EIB funding, which provided more than £5.5bn for UK-based projects last year. Climate investment forms around a quarter of EIB total loans, with the UK being the single largest recipient of clean energy lending in the past five years.\nMolly Scott Cato said:\n“Our commitment to the Paris Agreement means we must rapidly reduce our carbon emissions. It is therefore incomprehensible that we are set to deprive ourselves of the funds of the EIB, where we have been so successful, and simultaneously dismantle the Green Investment Bank. The preferred bidder, Macquarie, has a worrying and dubious track record of asset stripping and has dismal environmental credentials. Not only that, we now have a legal challenge on the basis that this is a bad deal for tax payers.\n“Climate change is one of the biggest challenges we face and if the government remains committed to tackling it we need to know how it proposes to invest in clean energy in future.”",

We used the Concorde Way weekly and are now being forced to drive.”\nDavid Wilcox, Lockleaze councillor and co-shadow cabinet member for Transport and Active Travel, said:\n“Of course Greens support the new train station but the diversion of Concorde Way is not fit for purpose. It brings pedestrians and cyclists into conflict on a shared pavement and through Boiling Wells cyclists must dismount because it’s so steep. If we’re going to reduce traffic and tackle the Climate Emergency, we need to be making it easier, not harder, for people to walk and cycle to work. This diversion – which is expected to be in place until at least November – undermines the Council’s own policy aims and will only encourage more people to drive, causing more pollution and congestion for all of us.”\nThe Green Councillors say Labour’s track record on transport is reflected by a cars-first attitude that “belongs in the 1960s” which has left Bristol falling behind other core cities and led to worsening traffic as the city’s narrow and crowded streets are filled with private cars, and could result in the city getting less funding for transport schemes in the future. The opposition councillors pointed to a long list of issues they say demonstrate this lack of ambition on transport, including failures to improve dangerous cycling infrastructure, removal of bike lanes and failure to maintain them, Labour plans to remove transport design powers, poor parking enforcement and a limited rollout of new cycle hangars (see full list in notes below).\nGroup Leader Emma Edwards, who shares the shadow cabinet role with David, said:\n“The failure to address this dangerous diversion for Concorde is part of a worrying trend we have seen of late, with this Labour Administration not only not improving things for cycling in Bristol, but in many instances actively making things worse. Far too many decisions by Bristol Labour – whether it’s removing cycle lanes, projects that don’t meet official standards (risking future funding), or simply dragging their heels on basics like new bike hangars – seem calculated to show contempt for cycling and walking.\n“The Concorde way diversion is merely the latest in a long list of similar issues that this Labour administration have presided over – just last week they decided to re-open a pedestrianised road to through traffic, ignoring the council’s own policies to put cars before pedestrians and cyclists. And the Mayor’s plans to scrap key transport and city design teams and hand those powers to WECA risks completely taking away our city’s ability to implement its own walking and cycling schemes in the future, which could make matters worse.”\nShe added,\n“Labour’s car-centric approach belongs in the 1960s – it’s getting us nowhere fast. With our buses in a state of near-collapse, and constant steps backwards on active travel, it’s not surprising Bristol is consistently one of the worst UK cities for traffic under this administration. Our city deserves better.”\nList of active travel issues raised by Greens:\nNotes\nCllr Emma Edwards is the Leader of the Green Group on Bristol City Council\nMore about EmmaCllr David Wilcox is the Green Group Whip\nMore about DavidCllr Heather Mack is the Deputy Leader of Bristol City Council\nMore about Heather",

The call follows controversy over a planned development for 135 houses in an old Chocolate Factory in Easton, which was postponed by councillors on the planning committee over concerns about the lack of affordable housing.\nGreen councillor Stephen Clarke, who tabled the motion said:\n“Everyone talks about the need for affordable housing – Bristol’s own Mayor Marvin Rees pledged to build 800 a year, but for this to be possible we need an urgent change in how our housing system works. It is all too easy for developers to fail to deliver the council’s own affordable housing target of 30%-40% by saying that if they include affordable homes they won’t make enough profit. At the moment, the council has very limited powers to insist on the affordable housing that is so desperately needed across the city.”\n“If developers say that they cannot afford to include affordable housing in a new development then the viability assessments they use to justify this should be made available to the public, as we call for in our motion. Developers must be prepared to be transparent with the public when they are failing to deliver the affordable housing Bristol so badly needs.”\nThe Green Party have called for half a million homes to be available for social rent by 2020 across the country. This would cost £27 billion over the course of the parliament which could be paid for by increasing Government spending on social housing by £4.5 billion a year and removing the cap on what local authorities can borrow to build new housing.\nLeader of the Green councillor group, Charlie Bolton continued:\n“We know that the housing crisis is a national, not just a local issue, but we need strong leadership from our city leaders to call for change. There are thousands of plots in Bristol with existing planning permission, but in many sites developments have stalled. It is just common sense to allow the Council to charge Council Tax on sites with planning permission if they have not been developed within a reasonable timescale, rather than letting them sit there unoccupied year upon year. If Council Tax was charged on the unbuilt properties rather than allowing developers to sit on the land, some £10 million a year could be added to the council’s income. ”\nCouncil Bolton concluded:\n“We hope to get cross-party support for the Green motion on affordable housing at next week’s Full Council to that we can see real change towards enabling more affordable houses to be built. After all everyone has the right to a decent home.”\n© Image Ruth Sharville",

A Recent analysis by the GMB shows that the number of EU nationals working in health and social care has increased by 72% in the last eight years and there are now 209,000 EU nationals working in the sector – up from just 121,000 in 2009.\nEU nationals now make up more than five percent of the entire health and social care workforce – including one in ten care home staff. The latest report comes hot on the heels of a leaked Department of Health study revealed that ending freedom of movement and clamping down on immigration would leave the NHS short of 40,000 nurses by 2026. A Freedom of Information request by Heart Radio further reveals the extent to which NHS Trusts in Devon and Cornwall are dependent on overseas nurses [1].\nMolly said:\n“The catalogue of evidence should be a wake-up call to the Tories and Labour who both want to end free movement. The GMB has called for an urgent post-Brexit plan for when free movement ends. But the surest way to guarantee our hospitals and care services are adequately staffed is to immediately grant rights for all EU nationals living in the UK to remain here, and to continue to allow freedom of movement. Greens are unequivocal on this – we will continue to defend free movement.\n“While we should acknowledge perceptions around immigration were key to influencing the outcome of the EU referendum last year, people did not vote to see their hospitals and care services go into meltdown over a staffing crisis. If we are to keep our health and social care services functioning properly we will continue to rely on people of all nationalities coming to work in the UK.\n“Where there are problems associated with free movement in the EU – with some countries experiencing skills shortages due to the emigration of workers – these should be addressed collectively by all EU countries, working on solutions together. What is clear is that one country shutting the doors on everyone else is a self-defeating policy when it comes to addressing the differing needs of different countries in Europe.”\nNotes\n[1] FOI request by Heart Radio reveals:\nCornwall Partnership: 22 nurses from the EU, 6 non-EU\nRoyal Cornwall Hospitals NHS Trust: 48 registered nurses and 30 healthcare support workers of non-British nationality.

As an administration, we are committed to putting a range of options on the table for the people of Bristol to have their say in all our consultations and to be transparent about this.”\nBristol’s recycling rate started to decrease under the previous administration and is now about 45%. The Greens say this must improve to be in line with the Government’s ‘Resource and Waste Strategy’, which aims for at least 65% of waste to be recycled by 2035.\nCosts of waste disposal are also going to massively increase in the coming years as a Government carbon tax on waste is introduced. The Greens say instead of trying to fund this extra costs the most viable way to make the services fit for the future is to earn money from increased recycling. This money can be reinvested in improving how and what Bristol recycles as well as increased reliability of collections.\nCllr Fodor, “We do have to increase our recycling rate as a city. A key reason for this is that Bristol currently recycles 45% of its waste and this has been falling. And while we believe that recycling more is essential, the government also has a target of 65% recycling by 2035, which we must meet.\n“On top of this, in the next few years the Government will be introducing a carbon tax on our waste, which will put strain on already struggling council finances.\n“The good news is that while disposing of waste costs taxpayers’ money, our recycled materials are sold to go back on the market across the UK, and this money can be reinvested in further improving the service, street cleansing and tackling fly-tipping.\n“Analysis shows that over 40% of what’s in Bristol’s black bins can be recycled, and a lot of this is food waste. So there is a lot of room to improve.\n“I want to see better separation of materials, larger recycling containers, better information on recycling, more consistent facilities and services in blocks and shared dwellings, and beginning to recycle soft plastics.\n“But these are only ideas, and we want to hear your feedback. By doing this, I am confident that we will be able to improve our recycling rate, together.”\nAccording to data from the council, the move from weekly to fortnightly bin collections in Bristol has been the only significant measure to improve recycling rates in the last 20 years.\nCllr Fodor continued, “One potential move forward is to decrease the frequency of waste collections. This has shown to have worked for more and more local authorities including our neighbours in South Gloucestershire and North Somerset, and the move to fortnightly collections has been one of the only things in Bristol to boost recycling rates in the last 20 years.”\nOnce the consultation finishes on the 10th of March, a task and finish group of the Environment and Sustainability Committee will consider the responses and put forward a recommendation as to how to improve recycling in Bristol going forward.”\nCllr Martin Fodor is the Chair of the Environment and Sustainability Committee\nMore about Martin",

Greens are backing a ‘Local Works’ campaign (1) which seeks to levy an additional 8.5% on business rates for supermarkets with a rateable value of over half a million pounds.\nThe campaign asks councils to back a proposal to make use of the Sustainable Communities Act (3) to introduce the levy. Such a levy already exists – it was introduced in Northern Ireland by the Northern Ireland Assembly in 2012. Thousands of small businesses have already benefitted. The aim of the campaign is to adopt this measure in the rest of the UK.\nGreen councillor Tess Green said:\n“The case for the benefits local shops give to the economy have been shown time and time again. More money spent in local shops is spent locally. More people are employed. And people are more likely to walk or cycle there, thereby benefitting the local environment.”\nGreen campaigner Charlie Bolton said:\n“This is a fantastic opportunity to support Bristols local high streets, local communities and local shops. In times of catastrophic cuts to local services, we’d be crazy not to support this proposal –\nwhich asks the very largest supermarkets to pay a little bit more – in order to support a large number of smaller businesses.”\nGreens are urging people who agree with them to sign the on-line petition set up on the council’s website.

Councillor Lake will continue to serve Bristol as Deputy Lord Mayor for the following year.\nLeading the vote of thanks, Councillor Eleanor Combley, leader of the Green Group said:\n“You have had some difficult meetings to manage, but where there was confusion, you brought clarity, where there was petulance, you brought dignity, where there was discord, you brought calm. And where there was discord that even you could not calm, you brought some fierce gavel work.\n“But what I have appreciated most in these meetings is the warmth and respect with which you welcomed members of the public to this gallery. None of us should forget that we derive any power we have as councillors from the people who have given us their vote, and you have shown your recognition of that fact in the way you have welcomed people who wish to attend, to speak, even to protest at these meetings.\nYour role in council is only a small part of the work of Lord Mayor, although it is an important one. You have also attended hundreds of engagements across the city, and across all our many different communities, and I know that you have done so with your customary grace and generosity with your time and energy. It has been a joy to watch you, throughout the year, inhabit this role, managing at the same time to be both entirely The Lord Mayor and entirely Cleo Lake.”\nCllr Combley’s sentiments were echoed by members from other party groups. Labour councillor Ruth Pickersgill said:\n“It was so refreshing this time last year to see the public gallery filled with elders from our local community and activists who’ve been working to challenge discrimination for years, and for them to start to feel that this chamber is somewhere relevant for them and that they can play a part in it.”\n“Every time you go out and represent us you’re giving a clear message about diversity and equality and I’ve watched your commitment and your incredibly busy schedule and been amazed at how many events you’ve fitted into each day, and how easily you communicate with people from all backgrounds and make them feel included.”\n“Your principled stand on anti-racism and your commitment not to collude with historical oppression and to challenge the shameful aspects of our city’s history has been a positive example to everyone”\nIn her time as Lord Mayor Cleo Lake has brought issues like these to the fore, making headlines early on in her term by removing a portrait of slave trader Edward Colston from her office (https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/19/slave-traders-portrait-removed-from-bristol-lord-mayors-office). She also took part in charity events, running a 10K and raising over £20,000 at the annual Lord Mayors charity appeal.

(https://news.bristol.gov.uk/news/lord-mayors-medals-celebrate-bristols-local-heroes). On May 18 Cleo herself received the Dr Paul Stephenson special recognition award at the Bristol Diversity Awards (https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/2019-bristol-diversity-awards-winners-2886073).\nIn her stepping down speech Cleo highlighted the wide range of events she had taken part in. She said:\n“South Bristol was one of my focal points for the year and I am proud to say that I made it my duty to visit as many schools as I could, primarily in south Bristol but right across the city too.\n“I was honoured to initiate a visit to 3 South Bristol schools with record breaking balloonist Brian Jones. I’ve listened to readers on the reading recovery programme, I’ve read stories to classes, I’ve given out certificates and attended aspiration days and have wondered how many year 3’s have gone home and said to their parents or carers ‘when I grow up I want to be a Lord Mayor’ – or ‘when I grow up I want to have rainbow coloured hair!’\n“On top of set engagements and civic duties like fortnightly citizenship ceremonies and the like, with the support of the Lady Mayoress we have also tried to push ourselves to do more. A good example was taking the opportunity to stage a ‘Windrush to Carnival’ variety show at the Hippodrome, with a raft of acts across generations, many of whom might never have played the hippodrome. And likewise much of the audience might never have attended the venue. The event raised over £2.5k for Sickle Cell.”\nThe Green councillor closed the speech reflecting on Bristol’s nature as a multicultural city. She said:\n“I have seen and believe that Bristol is a two-tone city. It is black and white and everything in between. It is ancient and modern, new and old. It is able bodied and disabled. It is gay and straight and everything in between. It is male and female and everything in between. It is vegan and locally sourced hand reared meat eating and everything in between. It is all of these things and more – our diversity is our strength.\n“This city was, is and can continue to be a leading city, whether that’s engineering, creativity, sustainability, tech, race relations or equalities.

North Somerset Council, which sits on WECA’s Joint Committee, passed a climate emergency motion in February.\nSince the Green party motion passed in Bristol, over 100 UK councils, the London Assembly and Parliament itself have passed Climate Emergency motions. Clifton Down Councillor Carla Denyer, who proposed the Green motion in November, has submitted a question to the Combined Authority meeting taking place in Bath today calling for similar action.\nExplaining her question, Carla said:\n“I think it’s about time the West of England Metro Mayor Tim Bowles declares a Climate Emergency! I have submitted the following question to the meeting this Friday:\n‘Two of WECA’s three constituent Councils (Bristol and BANES) have declared a Climate Emergency and set new carbon emissions targets. North Somerset, in WECA’s Joint Committee has also done so, and South Gloucestershire is shortly to debate it too.\nIn line with its constituent local authorities, will WECA declare a Climate Emergency and commit the West of England to go carbon neutral by 2030?’”\nRedland Councillor Martin Fodor has also submitted a statement to the meeting calling on the authority to declare a climate emergency, and bemoaned the authority’s lack of delivery despite its large pool of funding.\nHe said:\n“Like many people I’m frustrated at the way WECA has been accumulating funds with little useful to show for it. Here’s an urgent issue and we can’t wait any longer for action. I really want to know when the climate emergency will be recognised by WECA and when it will start to rewrite its plans and develop a detailed strategy to prepare climate-proofing projects we need and revising its spending plans? People are getting impatient with reports about doing more reports on possible strategy before there’s even a strategy!\n“Already two of the three authorities in WECA have declared a climate emergency, and South Gloucestershire is drafting a motion on the same subject. In addition North Somerset is also an authority that has declared it recognises the emergency. So almost all of the local authorities have shown they support a change of direction from the business as usual which is causing the climate breakdown. Meanwhile WECA just plods along doing nothing of substance but building roads and supporting the fossil driven economy of the past.\n“So when will WECA recognise the climate emergency and start to prepare real plans to do its bit?”\nThe WECA Committee meeting takes place at 2pm today (Friday 14th June) at the Guildhall in Bath.",

Figures suggest that the various taxes and\ncontributions that Bristol makes into the national purse does not equal anything like the amount of money that we receive in return. We have had soundings of retaining our business rates but that has been muted of late. It is hard to see this attack of austerity as anything other than an attack on the poorest in our society going hand in hand as it does with welfare reform. As our party co leader Caroline Lucas said back in 2014, “It wasn’t the poor who caused the economic crisis. It wasn’t people on Jobseeker’s Allowance who brought down the banks. It wasn’t people with disabilities who wasted billions speculating on risky financial markets. So that’s why we’re here to say: stop punishing the poor.”\nThe 2008 financial crisis led the UK government to bail out British banks at an estimated cost of\n£141bn. However this is not unprecedented this state intervention was undertaken to prevent a\ncollapse of the British banking system in many ways similar to the only other major government\nbailout in British history which occurred in the 1830s when the British tax payer without choice paid millions in compensation to the slave owners following abolition and as we all know the enslaved who were freed got nothing.\nIt disturbs me that we are the one of the richest countries in the world yet we are facing a situation that because of reckless mismanagement, greed and quite simply callous disregard, essential services are being reduced to nothing and other givens such as parks and libraries will likely close unless volunteers fill the void. It’s almost surreal. Austerity isn’t a necessity it’s a choice. Where is the tax Justice? Where is the right to life for us as citizens?\nIt’s a bleak picture which can only go in one of a few directions.\nThe Green Party is for the common good and believe me we are pushing ahead to make people\nknow that we stand for them and that they need to stand with us. We will be out with new plans\nand efforts under the banner of Grass Roots Greens spearheaded by myself because the truth is\nwhilst we must demand what we are owed, we can no longer rely on any of these so called leaders propping up as they do the final dirty dregs of neo colonialism and self centered extortion.\nThe government will be continuing to cut money to Bristol and other core cities forcing them to be more commercial and enterprising which could easily mean that all public buildings will be sold that’s your library your park your community Centre, frontline services will collapse, back room departments will collapse, people will leave work on long term sick and so on.\nWe are being told to do more with less with an unprecedented expectation on volunteers. Well that’s all very well coming from those earning 30, 40, 50, 100, 200 grand a year who perhaps\ncan afford to give some hours or who simply aren’t having to carry the stress of providing housing and food with no despots able income or on a zero hours contracts, but me personally I’m tired of the idea doing more for nothing. We are active citizens that’s why we are here today’s it’s one thing being a doer but another paying to be a doer and that’s what’s on the table if Westminster keeps cutting and if council tax continues to rise without delivering anything for the money.\nPay more get less seems to be the formula.\nI’m not down for their big society I’m all in for creating an alternative one. Where human beings are no longer commodities, where we don’t have gated communities gentrifying areas, where we support ourselves and cut out the middle men as Grenfell has shown when push comes to shove poor people are pretty much on their on own anyway. A society that values workers with respect, one that pays public service workers adequately in recognition of the reality that society would not function without them, one that does not pay life changing bonuses to bankers, one that doesn’t endorse tax avoidance by corporations and the super rich, one that doesn’t sell arms and fuels conflict and creates refugees. We must plot our moves to another way. We must take climate change seriously and we must invest in the Green economy and green jobs – we cannot support growth for growth sake without an eye on the future impacts of various industries. Yes we need jobs and opportunities but we must also ask why we need certain jobs what purpose do they serve and this will become more necessary when we move to automation and many roles will become redundant and a universal basic income will have to be a reality.\nThis anti austerity agenda must unite all of us\nEveryone should be asking the questions of where our money is going and we need more say in where it is spent instead of having no choice on their dictated priorities such as million pound upgrades to Buckingham Palace renewing Trident or DUP pay offs for example. Bristol gives way more than it gets and it’s time to demand our receipt. It is also very hard to watch local authorities be the puppets in executing these cuts, bowing down and driving through this deadly agenda. This is a good day today but it’s months too late as Greens we have lobbied for more action and until today we have to say to Labour who voted through these cuts on the fear of Westminster:\nThat in terms to standing up and defending us the people ‘We ain’t seen nothing yet’. In fact from Brixton to Bristol within your Labour led cities and boroughs all we see is raging inequalities and sell offs. Birmingham another Labour led core city has recently voted through a raft of redundancies to front line workers causing outrage and a strike on the ground by the refuse collectors.\nGood luck with the green paper – sadly I have seen how playing by their rules has got us precisely nowhere. It is them and US. But I am now becoming clearer on the US and the THEM. In these desperate last days of neo colonialism they have succeeded in driving a huge wedge amongst the people. Reports of the rise of racism and arson in areas like Hartcliffe and Southmead – I ask that we reflect and remember our collective histories particularly as marginalized and oppressed people of all shades of skin colour. Whilst the press gang will no longer be out tonight to hit you over the head in the pub and drag you onto slave ships to administer the dirty work and whilst the whip and shackle are no longer in the physical, most of us remain subdued and dupped still being co opted on the grand plantation of capitalism and debt . So much chat about Colston and as a founder member of the campaign group ‘Countering Colston’ let me tell you this that until the young white citizens in areas like Hartcliffe and Southmead call for the statue to fall, then removing it means less to me because until a huge section of people wake up and smell the myths we cannot actually move on.\nWe are living in an emperors new clothes situation where the sell is that everything is important apart from each other and the planet. The planet being the ultimate elephant in the room because without her we are no more. Climate change is real and it isn’t any of us to blame, sure we can adjust our lifestyles here and there but no, capitalism is to blame, the war on want is to blame, the pillaging of land for capital gains is to blame, the over riding dismissal and continual genocide of First Nation people is to blame, the love of money above all else is to blame. We need a values overhaul and we need it fast.\nNow is the time to choose our own clothes and wear them.\nEnd austerity or else.\nStop the cuts or else.\nSocial justice now or else.\nAnd I predict that the all else will have to be boycotts strikes and a return of the occupy movement.\nI am a proud Bristolian honored by standing here today to say these words which you can take or leave. History is made by the brave and by the bold and the history that we want to write is in our hands.",

This would form a starting point towards ensuring Bristol is hosting its share of refugees fleeing conflict.\n‘Other cities such as Glasgow, Birmingham and Edinburgh have already agreed to host 50 refugees.’ said Green Group Leader Councillor Rob Telford. ‘As a City of Sanctuary, Bristol must also play its part. I welcome the Mayor’s call for people to host refugees in their homes, but this is a sticking plaster for a much wider problem.

Whilst I am encouraged that officers are now looking into this situation, there is no time to waste. The Council urgently needs to search for suitable housing providers, which is currently proving to be the main stumbling block to good refugee provision.’\nCouncillor Anna McMullen, who has worked closely with refugee organisations in Bristol, added ‘It is appalling that the UK has only resettled 216 Syrian refugees in the past year.

The proposed development is by Conrad Energy Development for a gas powered plant at Philip Street Scrapyard in St Philips Marsh, just 80 metres from St Philips Marsh Nursery School.\nCouncillor Clive Stevens submitted a report to a planning meeting taking place on Wednesday 15 May opposing the plans, citing potentially illegal levels of noise and air pollution and high carbon emissions, and highlighting a list of problems with the application.\nCouncillor Stevens said:\n“Despite the declaration of a climate emergency in Bristol, in Parliament, and across large swathes of the UK someone has forgotten to tell the capitalists. In this case it is Conrad Energy Development who are bringing a planning application to install 3 gas powered electricity generators in an area of St Philip’s Marsh next to a nursery school, scheduled to become an area for business and housing.\n“Parliament may have declared a climate emergency but the UK Government are yet to take any action – the Government’s so-called Sustainable Energy Policy still encourages gas usage! Because of this government policy the Council’s planning officers are actually recommending approval. So there’s a chance that despite the best efforts of climate activists and local protesters this development could be passed.”\nCouncillor Stevens previously campaigned against plans for a diesel generator in St Phillips Marsh throughout 2016-2017. The proposals were eventually quashed after pressure from local residents and activists.\nIn his statement to the planning meeting [attached] Clive has asked a number of pointed questions to draw the committee’s attention to problems with the application – listing nineteen different issues.\nQuestions include:\n– Will the dense row of pine trees next to the exhaust chimneys trap the poisonous exhaust emissions and cause higher concentrations?\n– Why hasn’t the air quality report included the people who will be working all day right next to the generators and suffer the full force of the noise and pollution?\n– Why has the officer not insisted on offsetting 20% of the carbon emissions (the maximum allowable) and instead suggested 0%?\nCouncillor Stevens added:\n“This land is in central Bristol with developments starting to go up all around. Some eventually to be with affordable housing. If this goes ahead residents will have to suffer the noise and air pollution from this gas plant so the rich can pay out more to shareholders. If Conrad Energy want to make a killing from providing electricity to the grid they should do it in a way that doesn’t harm other people.”\nOthers objecting to the proposal included Green Party candidate for Mayor, Sandy Hore-Ruthven, who said:\n”The proposed gas power Station in St Philips Marsh is another example of good intentions being trumped by expediency. It is easy to ‘declare’ a Climate Emergency but much more difficult to implement one. Building a gas powered generator now means that it will be a generation before the power station is dismantled or renewed and so Bristol’s target to become carbon neutral by 2030 becomes harder still.\n“Turning down this proposal would send a clear message that we are looking for a different way to generate energy. We support carbon free alternatives that keep the air clean for our children and the planet.”\nDevelopers Conrad Energy state that small gas plants are important to provide the UK with peak demand energy. However there are alternatives to manage peak demand, such as battery storage. In 2017 a battery storage project was commissioned in Lockleaze after plans for a diesel plant were rejected. A large project built in Australia has already saved the energy grid approximately $40m in its first year.\nBackground\n– Health impacts of air pollution on children are numerous and WHO reports that “air pollution has a vast and terrible impact on child health and survival” – https://www.who.int/ceh/publications/air-pollution-child-health/en/\n– Research on the health impacts of air pollution in Bristol in 2017 found that around 300 deaths per year, or about 8.5% of deaths in the city, are attributable to air pollution – https://www.bristol.gov.uk/documents/20182/32675/Health+Impacts+of+Air+Pollution+in+Bristol+February+2017.pdf/4df2fce5-e2fc-4c22-b5c7-5e7a5ae56701\n– Cllr Stevens’ statement to Bristol Council’s planning meeting can be found here.",

The rally comes as a new poll finds that more voters in the South West back a referendum on the Brexit deal by a margin of 42% to 35% [2]. The threats to the NHS from Brexit will be a key feature of the rally. Dr Scott Cato said:\n“A murky network of fake think tanks, so-called charities and wealthy individuals are using Brexit as an opportunity to attack the regulations which protect our environment, health and rights and to push an extreme free trade agenda [3]. Many of these organisations – some with close links to government ministers – strongly favour the privatisation of our health service, and we see US corporate vultures circling in the hope of picking off our health services in any post-Brexit trade deal.\n“This is not what people voted for. We need a People’s Vote so people can decide whether what Brexit offers is actually what they wanted, or whether on reflection their interests and those of the country are best served by remaining in the EU. The latest poll showing that more voters in the South West favour such a vote than not demonstrates that people want to take back control from the inept politicians who have led us into this Brexit shambles.”\nThe South West People’s Vote Rally will take place on Saturday 11th September at Colston Hall.

This has worked wonders in places like Nottingham not only to raise revenue to invest for mass transit, but also ensuring clean air, for a healthier, safer city for all.”[1]\nThe committee also voted on a range of parking measures, including to increase the cost of a first car in residents parking schemes (RPS) from £56 to £124. This is far less than the more than tripling that was proposed by the previous Labour administration, and Cllr Plowden says, more equitable. [2]\n“The increase to £124 for a first car permit is solely based on the money needed to upkeep RPSs. he continues. “Any revenue raised from second or third car permits will go back into improving transport across the city.\n“Whilst we understand that sometimes private cars are essential, we also know that taking action for the health and safety of everyone in our communities, including those who can’t or choose not to drive, means helping all of us to make shifts in the way we travel.\n“These essential shifts are not going to happen on their own and managing parking is widely agreed to be one of the fundamentals of a robust transport strategy.”\nThe committee also agreed to set up two task and finish groups, one to look at a modern and holistic kerbside and parking strategy and one to look at supported bus services.\nCouncillor Rob Bryher, who will be chairing the kerbside and parking strategy task and finish group said: “The issues of the way the kerbside is used and parking more generally were completely ignored by the previous Labour administration. There has been no holistic parking strategy since at least 2016, despite pavement parking, lack of cycle parking and electric vehicle charging, and the need for better managed parking being major issues for residents.\n“We will work cross-party to ensure that Bristol does more to make pavements accessible for pedestrians, wheelchair users and those with buggies and prams, and create streets that are healthy, neighbourly and have more mobility options for residents.”\nWhile these votes were successful, the committee did not vote to implement charging at some district car parks which are currently free or to remove the 30-minute free parking tariff in all residents parking schemes. The four Greens were in favour of these proposals, but were outvoted by the other 5 committee members from other parties.\nCllr Emma Edwards, Leader of the Green Group and member of the Transport Committee said,\n“It is surprising to see Labour U-turn on this motion, since this proposal was part of the previous Labour administration’s budget. As Leader of the Green Group I am in favour of exploring all options that can reduce congestion, improve air quality and raise money to improve transport for everyone in our city, so I’m disappointed that some of these changes were not passed.\n“However, as I have said before, no one party has a monopoly on good ideas and that’s exactly what the committee system aims to utilise. We will now continue working cross party and with the communities that we serve, to make up the £276,000 a year that the council spends on keeping district car parks free in another way to make sure we balance the budget in the best interests of the people of Bristol.\n“It was great to see the committee model working to reach democratic consensus on a range of options to best serve our wonderful city. Thank you to the chair and officers who put in a huge amount of work prior to this committee to make it a success.”\nThe committee also voted to approve a business case and full planning application for the new Bristol Regional Cycling Hub in Lawrence Weston.\nNOTES\nCllr Ed Plowden is the Chair of the Transport and Connectivity Committee\nMore about EdCllr Emma Edwards is the Leader of the Green Group on Bristol City Council\nMore about Emma",

The report points to a stagnation, or even reduction, in recycling rates if the UK both presses ahead with plans to build further incinerators and abandons EU recycling targets post-Brexit.\nCommenting on the report, Molly Scott Cato, Green MEP for the South West, said:\n“Greens have long argued that the rush to incinerate our residual waste will undermine recycling rates. This report confirms that and worryingly paints a picture of a future where we could actually be encouraged to recycle less in order to provide enough material to feed these giant fires.\n“There must be an immediate halt to building any further incinerators in the UK and an urgent review of our waste strategy. As well as curtailing incineration, we must also ensure there isn’t a bonfire of EU waste and recycling legislation and targets post-Brexit; we must instead retain or improve EU ambitions on waste and recycling.”\nDr Scott Cato, who is an economist, has issued a challenge to Environment Secretary, Michael Gove:\n“I challenge Michael Gove to commit the UK to a circular economy; one in which products stay in use for longer, and at the end of their life are reused, repaired, re-manufactured, upgraded, or recycled. This is the path the EU is working towards [2].”\n“Incineration is a process that reflects our linear economy, which is based on extraction, production and disposal.

Most of all, I think we should all be thanking the members of OSMB who went through the reports with a fine-toothed comb and were rigorous in their questioning of all aspects. They broke open the black box of the numbers and as a result brought information into the public debate that had not really seen the light of day before.

I urge the Mayor to meet with the OSM party leads to discuss our report before concluding his decision\n• The sale of the land for the university campus at Temple Meads has damaged the economic case for the Arena. The site is now smaller and there is reduced opportunity to boost the economy of the area, part of which forms one of Bristol’s most deprived wards.\n• Members were encouraged by YTL’s vision for the Filton site, however, there were many details still to be confirmed as the scheme is only at an outline stage. In particular the major caveats in relation to planning permission (the sequential test) and the delivery of essential transport infrastructure.\n• The delayed publication of Value for Money reports created unnecessary pressures on officers and scrutiny to complete their work\n• There is little or no time for the Mayor to take note of the views of scrutiny before his decision is published on Monday”",

The West of England Combined Authority was set up to devolve power to the region, leveraging in funding to help deliver more jobs and better housing and public transport.\nCurrently made up of three local councils – Bath & North East Somerset, Bristol, and South Gloucestershire – WECA is no stranger to controversy after North Somerset turned its back on joining the authority in 2016. Seen as a mistake by many at the time, North Somerset since asked to join under new leadership. However this request was blocked by Bristol’s Mayor Marvin Rees over a funding row, prompting outcry from the other authorities and a political spat.\nAs a result, an Extraordinary Full Council meeting was called on Weds 25th November by Bristol opposition councillors to discuss WECA’s future. Green Councillor Jerome Thomas was one of the signatories to the motion that called the meeting. Speaking at the meeting, he said:\n“It’s nonsensical that North Somerset isn’t currently part of WECA. Nearly a quarter of North Somerset’s workers work in Bristol. Half of Bristol’s port is in WECA, half of it isn’t. Bristol’s airport is in North Somerset and is outside WECA. It’s pretty clear that we can’t sort out our city’s transport or housing crises unless we work with our next door neighbours.”\nRather than focussing on attributing blame to either side for the breakdown in WECA’s expansion, Green speeches at the meeting concentrated on the benefits of working together, and called on Bristol’s Mayor to open the stalled consultation and negotiate in good faith. Councillor Denyer said:\n“It’s clear we need better leadership both in Bristol and in the region – but rather than getting drawn into a pointless blame game we need to focus on what’s best for the city and our region, which is a working regional body that includes all four members. Only cross-boundary, cross-party work will deliver the homes and transport system we all need.”\nHowever, the West of England Mayor and Bristol Mayor did not get away without any criticism. Councillor Denyer also said,\n“I am extremely disappointed by our Conservative Metro Mayor Tim Bowles, who has failed to represent any of us with Government. Look at Greater Manchester – they have new houses, transport, and have negotiated 5 more rounds of devolved powers and funding. What do we have? A lacklustre metro mayor who has had no impact.”\nGreen councillors welcomed the meeting’s eventual result – the original motion was amended by Labour but still demonstrated strong support for WECA expansion, and called on the Mayor to meet urgently with other WECA authority leaders to agree a deal and publish the statutory consultation on North Somerset joining WECA.\nSpeaking after the meeting, Councillor Thomas said:\n“I don’t think it’s right for major decisions like this to be made privately by the Mayor without consultation or debate so I’m glad to have helped bring this meeting about. It has shown very clearly that Bristol Council supports North Somerset joining the Combined Authority – now the Mayor needs to get on with it and make that happen.”\n“All the evidence shows with devolution in the rest of the country, that when regions prove that they can work together, then significant funding will follow. Far more funding than if small differences prevent us from working together. But we need proper leadership. Properly representing us to negotiate funding with government, not just Mayors walking away from difficult negotiations.”\nNotes\n– The amended motion is attached here.

However, many campaigners and domestic violence survivors say that it’s too small an improvement\nBristol Zero Tolerance (BZT) is a Bristol Women’s Commission initiative run by Bristol Women’s Voice and funded by Public Health as prevention work. The aim of the project is to work towards Bristol becoming a city free from gender-based violence, abuse, harassment and exploitation. Their consultation response2 says\n“This proposal does not go far enough to prioritise housing for women, and their families, who have experienced domestic abuse and are living in refuge provision. The Council motion […] pledged that all those fleeing domestic abuse in Bristol would be in Band 1 in terms of housing priority. This policy does not reflect this decision and will not ensure that those in this position receive housing priority.”\nHowever, the concerns of BZT and other consultation respondents seem not to have been addressed by the updated proposals\nCouncillor Denyer explains,\n“My main worry is the means by which people in need of urgent rehousing get referred. Contrary to advice supplied by Bristol Zero Tolerance, the proposal will only allow people who are engaged in a ‘MARAC’ (Multi-Agency Risk Assessment Conference) process and have been classified as high-risk to be recommended to be moved into band 1.\n“The problem with this is that the main referrer to the MARAC process is the police, and many victims do not go to the police, particularly women of colour, LGBTQ women and disabled women.3 Worse still, research shows that most victims of domestic homicide were not classed as ‘high risk’.4 As Bristol Zero Tolerance said in their consultation response, ‘MARAC is a tool which is not perfect and which does not perfectly protect all victims from violence therefore using the concept of ‘high risk’ of death or injury should not be used as the only criteria for support.’”\nCouncillor Denyer has proposed that Cabinet reconsider the policy, and explore alternative approaches to protecting domestic violence victims as recommended by the UK charity ‘Standing Together Against Domestic Violence’.4\nENDS\nContact:\nCarla Denyer, Green Party councillor for Clifton Down\ncllr.carla.denyer@bristol.gov.uk\nNotes to Editor:\nProposals to Cabinet, p307 onwards (includes consultation responses from campaigning organisations, survivors and other members of the public) https://democracy.bristol.gov.uk/documents/g388/Public%20reports%20pack%2007th-Mar-2017%2016.00%20Cabinet.pdf?T=10\nBristol Zero Tolerance consultation response: http://www.bristolzerotolerance.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/BZT_BWV-Housing-Consultation-Response.pdf\nSafeLives report on ending domestic abuse: http://www.safelives.org.uk/sites/default/files/resources/Getting%20it%20right%20first%20time%20-%20complete%20report.pdf\nDomestic Homicide Review (DHR) Case Analysis Report for Standing Together: http://www.standingtogether.org.uk/sites/default/files/docs/STADV_DHR_Report_Final.pdf\nThe full version of Cllr Denyer’s statement to Cabinet, below:\nSTATEMENT TO CABINET – Tuesday 7th March 2017\nSUBMITTED BY GREEN COUNCILLORS\nAgenda Item 12: Prioritising victims of domestic violence and abuse for rehousing\nCouncillor Carla Denyer\nWhile this proposed change to housing policy for domestic violence survivors is undoubtedly an improvement on what we have currently, I think it’s too small an improvement.

Instead, 2 years later, our house is still on fire and our government seems unable or unwilling to respond appropriately. As the UK prepares to host the next round of global climate talks at COP26, this country should be leading the world in our climate response. Instead we are seeing local government decimated and struggling to maintain mandatory front line services, while central government is more concerned with political posturing than practical action.\nShe explained,\n“In Bristol, the Mayor agreed to the climate emergency declaration and has taken first steps towards meeting our climate goals. There is still more that Bristol could do, but with such little support from central government, the Council’s hands are often tied. You cannot put out a fire when your hands are tied.\n“I have been approached by councillors, local government staff and campaigners from all over the world, asking how Bristol is going to achieve its carbon neutral target by 2030, because they want to follow our lead. But I honestly do not have the answer for them. Bristol has the ideas, expertise and ambition, and Greens have the drive to push for political consensus. But we don’t have the political or financial support from central government. Instead our government seems to do nothing but put obstacles in the way of meaningful change.”\nProfessor Richard Pancost, head of the school of Earth Sciences at Bristol University and former Director of the Cabot Institute for the Environment said:\n“The climate emergency is real. It is urgent. Carbon dioxide levels currently surpass any the Earth has experienced for the past 3 million years; and we have reached that at rates nearly unprecedented in Earth history. 2014 to 2019 were the six hottest years in recorded history, and 2020 will almost certainly join them.\n“The impacts of this warming on climate and ecosystems are now impossible to ignore in their devastation and frequency. Moreover, the last year has taught us that our capacity as a society to adapt to any catastrophic change is far more limited than we had hoped. And yet we have only barely shifted the needle on our carbon dependency, an addiction that will be incredibly difficult to kick given its influence in every aspect of our lives. Every day, month and year that we delay makes it harder – not impossible but so much harder – to avoid the most catastrophic aspects of climate change.\nCouncillor Denyer continued:\n“Becoming a carbon neutral city is not only about tackling the global threat of climate change. It’s also about making our city a better place to live – for all of us. A city thriving with green jobs, where every house is properly insulated, every family has access to green and affordable energy and everyone has safe, healthy and sustainable ways to get from A to B. We can get there, but we need to up the pace of change.\n“If this government wants to tackle the climate crisis it needs to give local government more powers and funding to get the work done. Councils around the country are ready and waiting to help them do this.”\nENDS\nNotes",

Bristol’s Green MEP, Molly Scott Cato and Jolyon Maugham QC of the Good Law Project have been pressing for the release of impact studies on 58 sectors of the economy – which government ministers made public reference to on a number of occasions – and a report prepared by HM Treasury, comparing the predicted economic detriment of Brexit with the potential benefits of alternative free trade arrangements [1].\nMolly and Mr Maugham say there has been a ‘deliberate muddying of the waters’ over the release of the studies and are continuing to push for full release because the information is “of very considerable importance in informing public debate about the current negotiations regarding the UK’s proposed departure from the European Union [2].”\nMolly said:\n“The oral hearing today is about standing up for the public’s right to be as fully informed as possible as we prepare to leave the EU. You can’t build a road without a publicly available impact study, but apparently, it’s OK to drag a nation through one of the biggest changes in our lifetimes without allowing people to understand the consequences.\n“The government has muddied the water over these studies. Before Christmas there was the publication of some lazy cut-and-paste work whose only purpose was to misdirect attention from the real studies. Then there was the selective and secretive release of some information to MPs in private before a Buzzfeed leak which seemed to reveal – in part at least – exactly what we had been requesting. But this information has not, of course, been made fully available to the public.\n“The fact is, we still don’t know what the government is hiding. We need to force the government’s hand and make sure that any studies which are in the public interest are put in the public domain.”\nAn application for judicial review was refused in January on the grounds that an “adequate alternative remedy” exists, namely through Freedom of Information (FoI) requests. However, Scott Cato and Maugham, the claimants in the case, will renew their application at an oral hearing today. They say they have a claim under the common law powers and based on Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights. They will also argue that the FoI process is too slow to enable release of the papers prior to the anticipated date of our departure from the EU. A FoI request last year was refused on the grounds that releasing the information would “prejudice international relations.”\nJolyon Maugham QC added:\n“The British public are not children. We are not to be protected by a paternalistic Government from understanding what it knows to be the consequences for us of leaving the EU. What Government knows, what MPs know, what journalists know through leaks, and what the EU knows from its own studies, we, the British people, are entitled to know too.”\n[1] See previous releases, letters and articles relating to the Brexit impact studies here",

The whole project has been ideologically driven and is economically illiterate. With the price of renewables falling rapidly the deal can no longer pass the government’s own value-for-money test and will burden a generation of consumers and businesses with excessive electricity prices. The Green Party stands by our manifesto commitment to cancel this risky and uneconomic project.\n“The irony that this white elephant is to be built in the South West, the region of England with the greatest potential for renewable energy, will not be lost on many. We have the innovation, skills and resources to provide 100% of our electricity cleanly, safely and at lower costs than nuclear, and create thousands of new long-term jobs in the process. All we are missing is the political will to make this happen.\n“The NAO report provides another opportunity to end this expensive charade and move our energy generation towards cheaper renewables. We can and must seize this chance to move power supply away from foreign corporations dumping outdated nuclear technology on the UK and towards local communities owning and generating renewable power themselves through cooperatives and social enterprises.”",

The schools know this, the local communities know this, but there isn’t currently the money to make the small infrastructure changes that are needed to ensure children can get to and from school safely.”\n“It is not that I am against museums – I recently chaired a council enquiry day on the importance of culture in Bristol.

I understand this as my father built Concorde engines, but he still feels that improving the safety of his grandson walking to school has to be the priority.”\n“The Tory government’s drive to dismantle local government means less and less money is available for the crucial needs of the people of Bristol. If Tory councillors want enough money to support museums in a neighbouring authority, they should be joining the Greens in lobbying their colleagues in Government for more cash for Bristol.”\n“Councillors in different areas have raised concerns over different aspects of safety at schools or on routes to schools.

Further details can be found on the event organiser’s website http://bristolclimatemarch.info/ or on their Facebook page.\nGuest article by Geoff Collard, Bristol Green Party Membership Secretary.\nBristol Green Party is wholeheartedly in support of the climate change march and rally. At this crucial time, next week the Conference of the Parties in Paris (COP21) will debate climate change. It is the biggest international forum on climate change since Copenhagen. It is hoped strong international agreement will be reached on serious carbon and greenhouse gas reduction – and make no mistake, if these talks next week in Paris are a failure, the world is going to be even more endangered than it already is by the problem of man-made climate change.\nA huge international demonstration was planned for this Sunday on the streets of Paris to urge world leaders to come together and agree strong action on climate change. Sadly, understandably for safety reasons in the wake of the outrages in Paris, the French government has prohibited the march and rally which was to have taken place in Paris in order to put pressure on world leaders to agree serious carbon reduction targets.\nThis makes it all the more important that marches and demonstrations by people around the world, and not least in Bristol, are strongly supported in order to send a message to their leaders telling them to start addressing climate change urgently. Therefore it is really really important that we in Bristol make our feelings felt by having as many people as possible come on the march this Sunday 29th November, the day before the talks begin in Paris.\nClimate change is not, and must not be, a party political issue. It is too important for that, because it is an issue which affects each and every one of us whatever our politics. Therefore this march is not organised by the Green Party, as quite rightly, this march and rally is, and must be, a non-partisan demonstration to raise everyone’s awareness of the importance of the talks in Paris to every human being (and to all species) on the planet. But the Green Party is of course absolutely committed to any peaceful action which furthers tackling the problem of man-made climate change and its consequences.\nIf you care about the devastation that climate change is already causing, with homelessness, drought and floods in places from the Sahel to California to Bangladesh it is imperative now that we tell the world leaders that pushing ever more carbon into the atmosphere must stop – NOW. Whilst many of our members will be in Paris in any case, as many Green Party members as possible will be in Castle Park on Sunday. Please support the march by coming this Sunday!",

We want the Mayor to take much stronger action to ensure we get a more sustainable and welcoming public transport system.”\nTim Malnick, candidate for Bishopston said: “We need to reimagine walking as a method of transport with clearly marked routes and strong links with local high streets – so people have attractive places to walk to and enjoy.”\nThe Greens are standing in 23 wards in Bristol on Thursday 22nd May.

The Party will push for the re-election of Molly Scott Cato, who has a strong track record of achievement in the European parliament and is a leading and well-respected voice of opposition to Brexit both within the South West region and nationally.\nMolly, who has been Green MEP for the region since 2014 and is Green Party Brexit spokesperson, tops a list of six high profile candidates [2] selected by party members. The second candidate on the list is the out-going Bristol Lord Mayor, Cleo Lake, a champion of diversity, inclusion and cohesion who made headlines for removing pictures from her office which celebrated Bristol’s role in the slave trade [3].\nMolly has been highly critical of the government’s approach to Brexit. She took the government to court over their refusal to release economic impact studies on Brexit [4] and has sought to expose the individuals and organisations that pushed the Leave campaign [5]. She has consistently cautioned of the impacts of Brexit on manufacturing industry – warning that companies like Honda would quit the UK; raised concerns about the impacts of leaving the single market on farmers and has pursued the government over its failure to agree how to replace EU funds that support Cornwall [6].\nMolly Scott Cato said:\n“The Green Party welcomes these elections and we stand ready to contest them. People know that our message on Brexit has always been clear and consistent: we led calls for a referendum on the final deal and have long supported a People’s Vote.\n“Given the impasse in parliament, it is essential that we give the people a final say on the decision to leave the EU. It is a democratic necessity to check that Brexit is still what they think is best for the country. Polls consistently indicate that a majority in the South West now favour the UK remaining in the EU, so this must be an option in any further referendum.”\nIn the European parliament, Molly Scott Cato’s work has included developing measures to clamp down on tax avoidance and legislating on financing the green economy. She and other candidates on the Green list have also been at the forefront of efforts to tackle our ‘climate emergency.’ She said:\n“I hope my strong track record will encourage people to re-elect me to rejoin the influential Green Group in the European Parliament. We have achieved policies that deliver social and environmental justice including rules to combat tax avoidance, banning toxic pesticides that threaten our wildlife and legislation on financing the transition to a green economy, where I led the Parliament’s work.\n“I am proud of the fact that it was Green councillor Carla Denyer, third on our European candidate list, who successfully steered a Climate Emergency motion through Bristol City Council; 70 councils across the UK have since passed similar motions. As Greens, we embrace the growing movement of people willing to take action in defence of the climate, not least young people and school children.”\nMolly Scott Cato concluded:\n“Let’s use these democratic and proportional elections to mobilise one of the strongest pro-EU movements anywhere on the European continent and champion a fairer, greener, more democratic EU.”\nENDS\nNotes\nSee: OUR EUROPEAN PRIORITIES – WHAT WE GREENS FIGHT FOR: https://vote.europeangreens.eu/priorities\n[1] See attached photo.

However, the Labour group rejected an amendment to their ‘anti-austerity’ motion which called for ‘loud and active resistance’ to austerity.\nThe amendment suggested the Mayor follow the example of Stroud District Council, which is run by a cross-party cooperation agreement among Labour, Green and Lib Dem councillors and recently stated it would refuse to repay the government around £500,000 (See press release by Stroud Labour and coverage in local press). It also called for the Mayor to consider budget amendments from other councillor groups, instead of voting them down with a whipped Labour vote, as happened in February 2017 when Labour rejected Green budget amendments that would have saved the council £1.7 million. (2)\nProposing the Green amendment, Councillor Carla Denyer said:\n“When the Mayor went to Westminster in the autumn, a few days after participating in the anti-cuts rally, the ‘Green Paper’ he took with him was, contrary to the spin, not a treatise on reversing the cuts. It was an argument for investment in infrastructure projects and devolution. And even this painfully polite, not-ruffling-any-feathers request was completely ignored by ministers.\n“What us Greens and the wider anti-austerity movement in Bristol have been calling for all along is for Marvin to properly take the fight to Westminster. To tell Government that they have gone too far, and that you refuse to cooperate until they compromise. Because while Bristol might be vulnerable if it did this alone, Labour runs 10 of the 11 largest cities in the UK, so if they all acted in cooperation, it is a demand that the Government would be unable to ignore.\n“Now that the softly-softly approach preferred by the Mayor has been demonstrated to achieve nothing, we feel that our calls are even more justified, and the time is now.”\nSpeaking after the vote, Green Group Leader Councillor Eleanor Combley said:\n“It’s a shame that Bristol’s Labour Group has voted down our amendment calling for tougher action – we were looking to get the Mayor to commit to doing something about austerity beyond simply talking about how bad it is.\n“Under the spin of ‘sensible’ budgeting, Labour councils in Bristol and around the country are making deep cuts to services, many of which will be difficult or impossible to reverse. The past few months have shown just how weak the Tory government is and at this point direct action, coordinated with other councils, would actually have the potential to change things. Shutting our amendment down is a perfect demonstration of how the Mayor is putting the interests of the Labour Party before the city and betraying everyone who voted for Labour’s anti-austerity platform”\nFull text of Green proposed amendment here.",

After repeatedly missing deadlines set by the national government which Greens warned could expose Bristol Council to legal challenge, Bristol’s Labour Mayor produced two options for public consultation at a Cabinet meeting on June 18. However, the evidence on the efficacy of the Mayor’s options was not released until 23 July, more than three weeks after the consultation was launched. The timescales produced by the Council showed that under Marvin Rees’ favoured options air quality would not reach legal limits until 2028 or 2029.\nPoor air quality in Bristol is responsible for around 300 early deaths per year. The impact on people’s health is highest in some of the poorest wards in the City, where rates of car ownership are also low. For example, according to a Council report, as much as 10% of deaths in Lawrence Hill are attributable to air pollution.\nGreen Councillors said the timescales were unacceptable and said they would not be supporting either of the proposed options in the Council’s consultation, which closes on Monday 12 August. They called on the Mayor to urgently bring forward new proposals to improve air quality as fast as possible, and introduce measures to reduce private car use in the city centre, such as a congestion charge for out of town commuters which they proposed at the Council’s budget meeting in February.\nFi Hance, Green councillor and former Cabinet Member said:\n“It’s now been 1000 days since the Council passed a Green motion to deal with air pollution in Bristol and the Labour administration has run up against the latest of multiple missed deadlines. Asking Bristolians to wait as long as a decade to scrape by the bare minimum air quality standards is simply not good enough when toxic air causes 300 early deaths per year in this city. Instead of a false choice between two dubious options, rushed through at the last minute without evidence to support them, we urgently need new, tougher plans to clean up our air faster. The Labour Mayor’s failure to deliver clean, breathable air and treat this issue with the seriousness it deserves is hurting some of the poorest people in the city the most. Just as Bristolians responded ‘none of the above’ to the Council’s consultation on which libraries to close, my response to the Council’s clean air consultation is that neither option is good enough – we have to do more.”\nCouncillor Hance added:\n“But we also need more than a short term fix that achieves the legal minimum. Private cars are responsible for the majority of air pollution in Bristol, and as well as nitrogen dioxide cars produce harmful particulates that aren’t accounted for in the Council’s plans. We have to face up to the fact that any policy that doesn’t reduce private car use in the city centre is just tinkering around the edges. As well as tough clean air measures as soon as possible, we also need to make big improvements to walking and cycling in Bristol. Places that have done this, like Waltham Forest in London, are already seeing improvements in air quality and life expectancy. To help people out of their cars we also need to overhaul public transport – a congestion charge for out-of-town commuters coming into Bristol as proposed by Greens would reduce traffic, improve bus journey times, and give us millions to spend on improvements to our bus network.”\nThe Council’s Clean Air consultation can be found here and closes on Monday 12 August.",
  "https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_/https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_bristol-green-statement-on-yew-tree-farm/content_131.html": "menu\nIn response to the recent ecological destruction that has taken place on Yew Tree Farm, a Site of Nature Conservation Interest (SNCI), Bristol’s Green group of councillors have issued the following statement:\nFollowing the ‘wanton vindictive destruction’ carried out within the SNCI protected Yew Tree Farm last week, Bristol Green Party Councillors call for an immediate end to all destructive activity taking place. The Green Group have said all work must cease until a full investigation has taken place into the recent episode of ecocide, to ensure that no further ecological destruction is caused to the Yew Tree Farm SNCI and the neighbouring Colliters Brook SNCI.\nWe are absolutely disgusted to hear that Bristol City Council appears to have entered into agreement with the individual largely responsible for the destruction at Yew Tree Farm to manage the council’s own land within the neighbouring Colliters Brook SNCI. If this is true, it is a complete failure of the council to conduct due diligence regarding the past record of the individual concerned despite multiple warnings from members of the public. We now have strong, validated concerns that the devastation caused on a species rich hay meadow and ancient hedgerow at Yew Tree Farm will also now take place at Colliters Brook, unless immediate preventative action is taken.\nLast summer councillors from all parties, activists and local people came together to show their support for preserving the ancient hedgerow and the nature rich land around Bristol’s last working farm. That such damage has been done, seemingly with no intervention from the administration, is devastating. The failure of the council to respond to the destruction makes a mockery of the Labour Mayor’s declaration of an ecological emergency and exposes it for the publicity stunt that it was.\nConcerns have already been raised about activity that has taken place on the council land within the neighbouring Colliters Brook, including damage to a 200 year old oak tree and churning up of the topsoil. Furthermore, the identification of the presence of dormice on the land, potentially one of only two sites within the whole of Bristol to show evidence of dormice, appears to have been completely ignored.\nYew Tree Farm and its surrounding SNCI are a major source of biodiversity and nature within South Bristol and the city as a whole.\nWe therefore call upon Bristol City Council, the Mayor and the cabinet members responsible to take immediate responsibility for the council’s errors and failures, both administrative and political, that have either enabled or encouraged activities that led to the recent destruction at Yew Tree Farm SNCI.\nWe call on them to:\nAs a result of the decision by the Labour Mayor, bolstered by a Labour majority council, to encourage development of nature rich and biodiverse land at Yew Tree Farm in 2019, other players have now become involved.\nThe Bristol Green Party therefore also calls on the following organisations to accept that any proposal for residential development on Yew Tree Farm SNCI will not be considered appropriate by Bristol City Council, as made clear in the draft Local Plan. This includes the following:\nWe call upon Redrow/Barratt to:\nWe call upon David James/Newcombe Estates to:\nThe destruction caused to the Yew Tree Farm SNCI, as well as the damage to the Colliters Brook SNCI is a devastating blow to Bristol’s image as a green, nature loving city. As Greens, we take the protection of nature and biodiversity seriously. Earlier this year, in the summer, an enormous number of local residents gave up their time to support Yew Tree Farm and the tireless work Catherine Withers has done to promote nature and wellbeing in our city. The residents created a human chain along much of the length of the hedgerow that has now been devastated. Those residents, and Catherine, have been betrayed by those who are quick to promote themselves as “green” but disappear when the fair weather has gone.\nBristol Green Party will stand by Yew Tree Farm, and will continue to fight alongside Catherine Withers, local residents and campaigners, to halt and reverse the destruction of such a valuable part of Bristol’s natural heritage. We call upon others to do the same.",

  "https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_/https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_forum-is-free-war-on-drugs/content_879.html": "Darren Hall, Green Party parliamentary candidate for Bristol West, chaired the debate. Darren opened proceedings with some thought provoking experiences from his time at the Home Office, where he commissioned drug treatment services, highlighting the links between drug use and issues such as family breakdown, social isolation and sex work.\nThroughout the evening there was clear consensus that current drugs legislation is not fit for purpose.\nThe scale of the problem is huge: panellist, Maggie Telfer, CEO of Bristol Drugs Project, pointed out that research shows 1 in 5 people have been personally affected by drug problems. Fellow panellist, Dr. Ben Sessa, a psychiatrist who has worked in drugs research for many years, argued powerfully that the war on drugs is ‘the biggest socio-political failure of the last forty years’. People have taken drugs since the beginning of time and will continue to do so. Prohibiting certain substances is as foolish and will fail as surely as the US’s attempt to prohibit alcohol in the 1920s.\nCharley Pattison, a barrister at Queen Square Chambers, explained the frustration of being bound by a framework that prosecutes people for drug offences, despite offenders often having multiple unaddressed health and social needs. She explained that many offenders become more involved with drugs during their time in prison. Danny Kushlick, panellist and founder of Transform, also explored this relationship that seems to exist between confinement and addiction, in discussing the 1970s ‘Rat Park’ experiment. This experiment found that rats living alone in tiny cages chose to drink opium-laced, rather than pure water, some to the point of deadly overdose. Contrastingly those living together in a large space largely ignored the opium-laced water, indicating the potentially huge role of social and environmental factors in addiction.\nConfining drug offenders in prisons, like the rats in the experiment, is a disastrous sociological experiment that has gone on too long. It is Green Party policy to decriminalise drugs and treat addiction humanely, as the social and heath issue it is.\nHealth was a key area on which the panellists were able to agree the war on drugs had flatly failed. Dr. Diana Warner, Green Party Candidate for Filton & Bradley Stoke, was clear that from her perspective as a practicing GP alcohol is incredibly damaging, despite its non-prohibited status. The Green Party recognises the health risks of both illegal and legal drugs: regulations on illegal substances, but also much tighter rules on the alcohol and tobacco industries are Green Party policy.\nThe speakers agreed that harm-reduction approaches, introduced increasingly as prohibition has failed, have had some success in combating drug abuse. GP, Diana Warner, spoke of the vital role for drug replacement and needle exchange programmes in reducing harm in Hartcliff, where heroin use is high. The Green Party supports such harm reduction approaches to drug use.\nFinancially the drugs war was also denounced as a total failure. Ben Sessa argued that whilst the people have lost out in every imaginable way, the drinks industry, and of course organised crime syndicates have grown unimaginably rich from current drugs policy: cannabis is the third biggest cash crop on the planet. Bringing these industries into regulation would mean huge tax revenue could be collected and used to fund education, health and social care. See Green Party policy on this here.\nThe global conflict that has been a product of the war on drugs was also a major issue of concern for the panellists. Transform’s Danny described the devastation the drugs war has wreaked on countries in the Americas. Over 100,000 people have been killed in Mexico in drugs wars. He argued there are huge international security benefits to be gained from shifting to a regulated regime. Diana also discussed this, describing her horror of hearing that the invasion of Northern Mali had been financed by the illegal drugs trade, and how this finally convinced her of the case for regulation.\nWith a quick show of hands demonstrating the audience was in firm agreement that the war on drugs had failed, the debate moved on, asking: what viable alternatives exist? Ben Sessa argued for an, ‘accessible, safe and regulated’ policy towards drugs to be adopted. He acknowledged this would be a PR challenge however, given those who moralise about the dangers of illegal drugs often do so with a cigarette in one hand and a pint in the other! Meanwhile successive governments are all too willing to pander to this moralising agenda, as the sacking of Professor David Nutt by the previous Labour government attests to.\nMaggie Telfer from BDP, queried how it is possible to create a comprehensive regulatory system when so many new substances – so-called ‘legal highs’ – are being created every day. Danny gave a response to this, outlining the work Transform have done in creating a blueprint for regulation. He also seemed optimistic, arguing that the mood of the nation is changing and that people are more amenable than ever to the idea of drugs reform.\nDarren Hall rounded off the evening with an appeal for people to exercise their democratic right to vote come May. If drugs policy is to be transformed then the electorate need to be politically shrewd, engaging officials on this subject. Mind-altering substances are here to stay whether we like it or not. A vote for the Green Party is a vote to end the destructive and futile war on drugs, and a vote for the beginning of a much more humane and more rational response.\n[Following this event, Darren Hall published the following article in the Huffington Post, calling for the use of evidence in tackling the causes of drug use]\n[Special thanks to Liam Keown for providing photos of this event]",

The conclusions have been put together into reports that will be discussed at Tuesday’s Cabinet meeting.\nIn a statement to the meeting, Mr Dyer points out that many of the issues in the various commissions are cross-cutting, and that tackling each one will require joined-up thinking across policy areas. He criticises the Coalition government’s implementation of the Under-Occupancy Charge as an example of an ill-thought out approach to policy.\nMr Dyer writes:\n“Elsewhere on this meeting’s agenda, there is discussion of the council’s approach to the Under-Occupancy Charge (“Bedroom Tax”). This welfare reform, along with other welfare reforms, has a major impact on Fairness, especially accessibility to Housing. Fairness is also impacted by Education and Skills which directly impact employment potential, whilst Fairness of access to Sport has an impact of health and wellbeing.”\nMr Dyer also points out the lack of action on many issues in the past, and the need to drive forward with the recommendations: “There have been far too many examples in the past of wonderful sounding reports failing to deliver any real change.\n“Where there are recommendations made within the report that are purely within the remit of the council to implement, the council should either set a timeframe in which to implement them, or provide an explanation of why it has decided not to pursue those specific actions.”\n“I look forward to the Mayor setting a time frame at the end of which there will be an opportunity to scrutinise what concrete actions have resulted as a consequence of the time and effort put into the Commission Reports being considered today.”",

However, it doesn’t take a farmer to tell you that words butter no parsnips and we will need to keep the new Environment Secretary in special measures until he delivers on his promises.”\nSpeaking this morning on BBC Radio 4 Today, Molly said:\n“As long as we make sure that he doesn’t consider grouse moors and other things his wealthy friends do with their land to be of environmental benefit, I think we can be in agreement.”\nShe went on to argue that the most pressing environmental priority was tackling climate change. She said:\n“In order to stay within the 2-degree safety limit we have to recapture a lot of the carbon that is already in the atmosphere which is very much about how we use our land. We should be rewarding the type of farming that captures and stores carbon such as restoring wetlands, greater use of agri-forestry and tree planting.”\nMolly concluded:\n“Where Michael Gove and I part company is over our membership of the EU.

  "https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_/https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_darren-hall-at-bristol-post-hustings/content_876.html": "menu\nBristol West candidates debated at Cotham School on Wednesday night in the Bristol Post hustings. Recent polls show momentum is with the Greens. Chair Mike Norton opened by reminding the audience that ‘there are still plenty of undecided voters’ in this tight marginal seat.\nThe seat features a close race between the Greens and Labour. With the Greens well ahead of the Lib Dems, their incumbent MP Stephen Williams is set to lose his seat. The future of Bristol West lies in the hands of either Green candidate Darren Hall, or Labour hopeful Thangham Debbonaire.\nWith Debbonaire arriving late, some forty minutes into proceedings, Green candidate Hall stole the limelight. Hall opened by promising to be a ‘voice’ for ‘many thousands of people’ struggling for social change. He champions movements against TTIP, NHS privatisation, fracking, anti-migrant hysteria and attacks on welfare. Bristol has a chance to elect a representative that will champion its status as a ‘world leader in demonstrating that a better vision for the future is possible’.\nHall pledges to help create jobs, whilst reducing inequality and our impact on global climate change. Distancing himself from the lack of boldness that pervades mainstream politics, Hall thinks long term and talks about the big issues. It is, as he puts it, about vision and values.\nNeither Labour nor the Lib Dems had a good night. Lib Dem candidate Stephen Williams was repeatedly moved back on track by the chair, Mike Norton. When it was time to talk about Residential Parking Zones, he reminisced at length about his glory days at Avon Council. The chair, Mike Norton, stopped him mid-flow and told him to answer the question.\nWhen it was time to talk about tuition fees, he banged on about the Labour candidate for Bristol West at the last General Election. Once again, the chair stopped him and instructed him to focus on the question. And when it was time to talk about potential coalition partners, he focused on proportional representation. Again he was told to ‘answer the question’. When he finally got around to answering, the chair cut him short because he had taken up too much time.\nWilliams bases his appeal for re-election on the ‘incumbency factor’. He is a sitting MP with ministerial experience. But this link with Westminster was all too transparent in his inability to answer questions. He has clearly learnt a lot in government.\nAt times, Stephen Williams must have wished he was somewhere else. He may well have wished he was Labour candidate Thangham Debbonaire, who really was somewhere else, having been held up on her way to the hustings. The first forty minutes of the debate took place without her. Some in the audience met each mention of her name with angry mutters and incredulous splutters. When she turned up to finally occupy her empty chair, a smattering of slow clapping rose to greet her arrival.\nThe first thing an irate-sounding Debbonaire had to do was defend Labour’s notorious ‘Controls on Immigration’ mug. The mug is availabble on the Labour merchandise website. ‘Who here thinks there shouldn’t be controls on immigration?’, asked Debbonaire, defending the indefensible.\nThings went from bad to worse, with Debbonaire later insinuating her preference for a Labour-Lib Dem coalition. Indeed, Labour and the Lib Dems found much in common over the course of the night. Their candidate statements resonated on topics such as immigration and the need for austerity. Green candidate Hall set himself apart by stating that the Greens ‘definitely won’t prop up a Tory government’. A vote at the party’s Spring Conference decided that there would be no coalition with a party advocating austerity. If they were to support any potential government, this would proceed only on a vote by vote basis.\nThe Lib-Lab truce was briefly broken when Williams criticised Debbonaire on the topic of tuition fees. The proposed Labour reduction of tuition fees from £9,000 a year to £6,000 would benefit only the richest students, Williams said. Those who walk into the most lucrative jobs post-degree would begin paying back the reduced amount sooner. They would be debt-free sooner than their lower-paid counterparts, who would continue racking up interest well into the future.\nCriticism from the Lib Dems is bad portent for Labour’s fees policy, and only goes to show that neither party has the answer. Only the Green Party advocate the abolition of the usurious and unworkable tuition fees system. Darren Hall was clear that ‘they should be scrapped’.\nHall pointed out ‘how odd it is that we hear from politicians that it’s not okay for the country to have debt, but okay for students’. When Hall went to university it was free, and he received a grant because his parents were on a lower income. He is in favour of restoring such support today. ‘If people get good jobs, they pay more tax’, Hall said, and it is this tax that pays for education. There is no need for students to repay by means of the fees and loans system.\nHall also attacked the stratospheric rise in Vice Chancellor pay, noting that it is ‘no wonder universities cost so much’ when VC’s are so well-recompensed. The Greens would legislate for a 10 to 1 pay ratio on university campuses, regulating widening inequality between the highest and lowest earners.\nWhere Hall took a stand against any efficiency savings in the NHS, Labour’s Thangham Debbonaire faced tough questions on her party’s health policy. Debbonaire said that Labour will scrap the Health and Social Care Act, which paves the way for private enterprises to run NHS services. But a member of the audience pointed out that the Labour website promises only the get rid of its ‘most damaging aspects’. This is not a commitment to scrapping the Act, and still allows for private businesses to run the NHS.\nHall, on the other hand, is firmly against this creeping privatisation. Rather than outsourcing and efficiency savings, Hall thinks that government should put more money into the NHS instead. There is ‘no room for the profit motive in the NHS’, Hall said. When the Attlee government established the NHS, he said, the debt to GDP ratio was 240%. Today it is much lower. It is ‘time to invest in the NHS’. In Hall’s view, investment should combine with new approaches. ‘We run an illness system’, Hall claimed, not a health system. ‘We need to deal with the causes of illness’, he suggested.\nOne example he gives is the transport system and the air pollution it creates. That day, the Supreme Court ruled that city councils should do more to improve air quality. Hall emphasised the importance of this judgement, telling the audience that more people die from issues related to air quality than who die in car and road accidents.\nCar and road safety were up for debate elsewhere, too. There were extensive exchanges on residential parking zones and the introduction of 20mph limits in Bristol. Hall said that, whilst 20mph zones have not had the desired impact, they do give a greater ‘feeling of safety’. In some areas, children play in the streets. The message that 20mph zones set is that the streets are ‘spaces not only for the ownership of cars and the rights of car owners’.\nHaving set out his stall, Hall concluded by reinforcing his credentials. Bristol has the chance to build upon its ‘fantastic grass-roots innovation and creativity’. It can burnish its reputation for ‘amazing environmental action’. This it can do by returning a Green MP to parliament.\nHall would challenge ‘an energy system run by big business’. He would take on ‘a transport system run by private companies’. And he would shake up ‘a planning system run for the benefit of developers’. He would overturn the sorry state of affairs whereby ‘the top 1% have the same as the bottom 55%’. He would stop the NHS being gradually ‘sold off to the highest bidder’. And he would work to ensure that corporations ‘pay their fair share of tax’.\nIn order for him to do this, the Greens have to beat Labour in this closest of electoral races. The momentum is behind them. But for Hall to be Bristol West’s next MP, people need to remember his closing message at the polling stations next week: ‘Vote bold, vote brave, vote for what you believe in.’",

Constituents’ worries over the new regulations have prompted the region’s Green MEP, Molly Scott Cato, to write a letter to EU Commission Vice President Andrus Ansip, who has responsibility for the Digital Single Market [1]. In the letter she outlines the concerns of constituents who run very small businesses and calls for a Europe-wide exemption for businesses with a turnover of less than €100,000.\nThe new regulations are designed to prevent multinational corporations from avoiding tax on digital sales in other countries, but are likely to have a devastating impact on some of the South West’s micro-businesses. The changes mean VAT on digital products sold in the EU will be chargeable in the place of purchase rather than the place of supply. This means micro-businesses will now be obliged to collect VAT from up to 28 different EU states at 75 different rates. Molly Scott Cato said:\n“Some of the smallest businesses simply had no idea that this change was on the horizon, and have not been able to prepare. Even if they had known early enough, the complexity of the administration required puts many businesses at risk; many constituents are telling me that the new rules make their micro-businesses unviable. It is tragic that the entrepreneurial approach shown by many in the South West should be undermined by a policy which, while having laudable aims, has such serious flaws.”\nDr Scott Cato, an economist, points to the fact that small businesses are responsible for the creation of at least 80% of jobs across the European Union. She is calling for an exemption for businesses with a turnover of less than €100,000 across the whole of Europe:\n“I have been really impressed by the way my constituents have taken such a positive approach to the single market and to selling their digital products across Europe. It seems to me that the simplest way out of this situation, and for these businesses to continue to be viable, is to allow countries the option of introducing an exemption for businesses with a turnover of less than €100,000,”\nsaid Dr Scott Cato.\nNotes\n[1] Latest updated guidance from HMRC on the new VAT rule change: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-supplying-digital-services-to-private-consumers/vat-businesses-supplying-digital-services-to-private-consumers\n[2] http://ec.europa.eu/priorities/digital-single-market/index_en.htm\nSee Twitter #VATMOSS #VATMESS for latest responses to the new VAT regulations\nMolly Scott Cato is the first elected Green MEP for the South West of England and Gibraltar and is one of 50 Green/EFA MEPs in the European Parliament.

The legislation sets climate targets for each country for the period 2021 to 2030. But with the UK set to leave the EU before this time, Dr Scott Cato is demanding Mr Gove set targets at least as ambitious as those of the EU. She said:\n“I can think of few people less fit for the role of environment secretary. He has consistently voted against measures to tackle climate change and infamously tried to remove the issue from the national curriculum when he was education secretary.\n“However, I welcome the fact he has hit out at Donald Trump over his decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement [2]. Let’s now see if action matches words and whether this apparent new-found commitment to tackling climate change means anything in practice. Let’s see him pledge the UK to match or even better the rather unambitious targets on reducing emissions being discussed and voted on in Europe. Here is his first real test.

The campaign for such a Bill is being widely supported by a network of NGOs, cooperatives, faith groups, MPs and Unions [1].\nThe Green Party has long championed firm action on tax avoidance as an alternative to austerity and fully back the Bill which calls for new rules to make the UK tax regime more transparent and tougher on tax dodging [2]. Green Party policy is to crack down heavily on tax havens and other methods of tax evasion and avoidance, and press for a transparent country-by-country reporting so that company profits can be located and taxed [3].\nGreen Party finance speaker, Molly Scott Cato MEP, who is a member of the European Parliament’s tax working group, said:\n“In the wake of repeated tax avoidance scandals, it is now all the more vital that we put in place legislation to ensure corporations and wealthy individuals pay the taxes that treasuries need to invest in public services and infrastructure. Greens have been pushing hard in the European Parliament for a full inquiry into the Lux Leaks scandal but unfortunately, despite the rhetoric from both Tories and Labour on the issue, they have refused to back such an inquiry.”\nIn 2011 Green MP Caroline Lucas launched the Tax and Financial Transparency Bill in the House of Commons [3]. She exposed the fact that HMRC was failing to prevent serious tax evasion, amounting to as much as £16 billion of lost tax each year. Despite two attempt at getting the Bill passed, it failed to gain enough Parliamentary support.\nGreen Party leader, Natalie Bennett, said:\n“Tax avoidance has cost this country tens of billions of pounds over the course of this Parliament, at a time when public services are being slashed. If the Government’s political priorities had been clamping down on tax avoidance, rather than dismantling our welfare state and public services, then we’d be in a far fairer, more humane, and more economically stable Britain.

Today is Clean Air Day where across the country people are uniting to raise awareness of air pollution.\nGreen Councillor Charlie Bolton who is the Councillor for Southville where air pollution was particularly high over the weekend said:\n“The time for platitudes and vague commitments around air pollution is over. We can no longer wait while people die from air pollution, we need action now. How can we stand by and watch while in some of the poorest areas of our city one in ten lives are shortened by air pollution?”\n“The work to promote walking and cycling in this city seems to have stalled in the last couple of years. But ‘active travel’ alongside good public transport needs to be taken seriously if we are serious about addressing our air pollution crisis. We need to systematically increase investment to both get people cycling and keep them cycling. And we need to take measures to make walking an easier option – especially for those who are more vulnerable”\nGreens successfully tabled a motion on air pollution back in November 2016, calling for a clean air zone in Bristol and a recent report to Cabinet showed that, in some areas of Bristol, over one in ten of early deaths can be attributed to air pollution.\nHere in Bristol Luke Jerram’s latest sculpture of a giant diesel soot particle, has made the issue more visual in the lead up to Clean Air Day. Inhale depicts a diesel soot particle that is 3 million times larger than the real size.\nGreen Councillor for Ashley, Jude English said:\n“There is a real role for art in making this invisible killer visible for the people of Bristol. Luke Jerram’s sculpture reminds us of the invisible particles that we breathe in every day. It reminds us of the consequences our poor transport infrastructure, congestion and reliance on cars has on our city and on each other.”\n“We know that we can do better as a city than the traffic jam packed streets we have at the moment. 72% of people in Bristol consider air pollution and traffic pollution to be a problem or serious problem in their neighbourhood, which is why we are calling on the Mayor to start putting words into action.”\n“Yes there are difficult decisions to be made, especially around introducing a congestion or charging zone for dirty vehicles in some of the most polluted parts of the city and yes these decisions won’t be universally popular. But this is about vision and leadership, not about shying away from tackling health inequalities and the difficult decisions that will make our city a better place to live.

This ground-breaking agreement, unique in Bristol political history, increases the prospect of electing a progressive pro-European, pro-electoral reform MP for Bristol North West.\nAgreement has been reached around three key policy commitments:\n(1) As a pro-European candidate, Mr Jones will call for a referendum on the final Brexit deal if it is rejected by parliament – giving the British people the choice of which direction their country takes, once the alternatives can be clearly seen.\n(2) A commitment by Mr Jones to campaign and vote for electoral reform, including the adoption of a truly proportional system of representation for UK General Elections and other local and regional elections. This will include actively campaigning to change the voting system so that the make-up of parliament and other elected assemblies more accurately reflects the voting patterns of the UK electorate.\n(3) A commitment by Mr Jones to regular meetings with Bristol Green Party representatives during his term of office to discuss issues that are of particular concern to the Green Party. These include: improving air quality, increasing the levels of social rent housing, developing renewable energy schemes, expanding energy efficiency programmes, protecting the environment, and reducing inequalities.\nIn return for the above agreed commitments, the Green Party candidate Sharmila Bousa will step down from campaigning in Bristol North West. This means the Green Party will do no freepost leafleting, make no Bristol North West specific hustings appearances, do no doorstep canvassing and no delivery of election leaflets during this General Election campaign in the Bristol North West constituency.\nMs Bousa commented:\n“My decision to step aside from active campaigning has not been taken lightly, however I live in the heart of this constituency and I know that people here want the progressive parties to work together. I believe that this is an exceptional election called in exceptional circumstances, and its outcome will have an exceptional impact on our futures”\n“We need new ways of thinking and new ways of doing politics” she added. “Sometimes that requires people to make sacrifices for the greater good and to put party politics to one side. Darren has made several concessions on policy, and in return I am making the concession of immediately withdrawing from active campaigning in Bristol North West. Our joint aim is to deliver a progressive MP for Bristol North West better able to represent ALL of its people.”\nMr Jones commented:\n“We need to get the best deal from Brexit. And that includes being prepared to go back to the British people to vote on the final deal before leaving the EU. The majority of people in Bristol North West voted to remain in the EU, and I believe that even more want a pro-European MP representing them in Parliament voting on every important Brexit vote over the next five years.\nI am therefore grateful to the Green Party for taking the difficult decision not to actively campaign in Bristol North West, and to support my candidacy as the only progressive pro-European who can beat our Brexit Tory MP.”\nHe continued:\n“By working cross party in the national interest, I hope to fight for the people of Bristol North West as their MP, not just on Brexit, but also on protecting our NHS, on providing proper funding for our local schools, and on campaigning to get better public transport in Bristol.\nTo see a statement by Sharmila providing more background information to this announcement please click here>>>",

I am proud that the Green Party councillors led Bristol to make the first Climate Emergency declaration in Europe, and kick-started a wave of similar declarations across at least three-quarters of the UK’s local authorities, as well as many other governments and organisations.\n“Many of these declarations were accompanied by ambitious new carbon reduction targets, making a substantial contribution to tackling the climate crisis.\n“However, I also feel frustration, and sometimes even despair. Because three years later, not enough has changed. Bristol, the UK and other countries across the world have commissioned reports and made positive noises, but ultimately changed very little.”\nFollowing the declaration, the One City Environment Board was set up in July 2019 to “lead the development of a Climate Strategy for Bristol”. In October 2020, they published a Council Climate Emergency Action Plan, which has been criticised by Green Councillors for lacking concrete actions.\nOther steps taken across the city include the introduction of a Clean Air Zone (CAZ) in 2022 and proposed updates to the Local Plan to require new developments to be zero carbon. However, the CAZ, which will affect 1 in 4 drivers, is focused on reducing Nitrogen Dioxide emissions, not car journeys or carbon, so is unlikely to reshape transport patterns or carbon emissions substantially. And the update to the local plan, proposed in a motion brought by Greens in September, may not be in place until 2024.\nAs well as this, the current administration has refused calls to oppose the proposed expansion of Bristol airport, and have yet to divest millions of pounds in council pensions from fossil fuel investments. They also voted against a £10m retrofit Green capital budget amendment two years ago, and attacked a recent Green motion for a Workplace Parking Levy, even though it was a measure proposed in the One City climate strategy.\nCllr Denyer continues, “I do not get the sense that the politicians from the other parties – who were happy to jump aboard the Climate Emergency bandwagon, have properly grasped that acknowledging that we’re in an emergency means that we need to act like it – things need to change, urgently. We’ve seen this at both an international level, with COP, and locally here in Bristol. But as US environmentalist Bill McKibben has said, ‘winning slowly is the same as losing’.”\nCouncillor Lily Fitzgibbon, who job shares Bristol Green Group’s Shadow Cabinet role for Climate and Ecology with Cllr Denyer, said:\n“It’s amazing to see how far Climate Emergency declarations have come over the last three years – from every level of government and every kind of organisation we are seeing a real awareness of the severity of the situation. But awareness isn’t action, and we need to see concrete changes in the city to reach our net-zero target.\nShe added:\n“Polling consistently shows that the public want strong climate action and support green policies. It’s time for the other parties to get with the programme or get out of the way.”",

The fact that people cannot afford to put food on their tables is an indication that the economic system is fundamentally broken. It generates ever-increasing inequality and works in the interests of the wealthy and powerful rather than for the common good.”\nFood Banks will be discussed in Parliament on Thursday in the wake of a 170% rise in the number of people turning to them for food in the last 12 months [1]. The South West has the highest number of children using Food Banks; statistics from 2012 show that one in 120 children in the South West was fed by Food Banks [2], a figure likely to be even higher now.\nThe Green Party is focusing on the issue in the run up to Christmas as this is a time when spending pressures are mounting and, with wages stagnating, more families than ever are expected to use Food Banks over the festive period. Greens also blame welfare reform and cuts to welfare payments for a sharp rise in the use of Food Banks.\nDr Molly Scott Cato said:\n“Hunger is haunting our communities in a way that shames us all and is particularly harsh at this time of celebration. In the sixth largest economy in the world no-one should be relying on emergency food handouts at Christmas, it’s a national disgrace. This rise in the use of Food Banks is a symptom of an economic system that categorically fails to meet the needs of ordinary people. We need Green Party solutions including the introduction of a National Living Wage, ensuring benefits are set at levels which allow people to live in dignity and investing in job creation, especially for young people.”\nNotes\n[1] http://www.trusselltrust.org/stats\n[2] http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/oct/16/food-banks-trussel-trust-uk-data\nReport from Keith Taylor Green MEP, South East: Hungry Christmas – Food Banks in the South East: http://www.keithtaylormep.org.uk/2013/12/16/hungry-christmas-introduction/\nHuffington Post blog by Keith Taylor: http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/keith-taylor/food-banks-uk-economy_b_4452964.html?utm_hp_ref=tw",

If the Prime Minister cannot ensure this it will mean a loss of jobs across the country as companies move their production facilities into mainland Europe. This will damage the livelihoods of the very people that Theresa May claims to wish to help.\n“But the single market is about more than trade. It has helped protect us from the worst excesses of Tory Britain. Continuing a close relationship with the EU, including continued membership of the single market, will help maintain these valuable protections.”\nJonathan Bartley, co-leader of the Green Party, also said:\n“The single market is about far more than jobs and business, and it is deeply concerning to see Theresa May disregarding its many benefits and hinting she will not be insisting on continued membership as part of any Brexit deal.

The Councillor for Bishopston and Ashley Down said she was delighted by the news, and noted that it would save the council money as well as providing better care for looked after children in the City.\nCouncillor Combley submitted a statement to cabinet thanking Cabinet Member Helen Godwin for her support and the council officers who worked on delivering the project. She said:\n“Looking after our children in care is one of the most important responsibilities we have as councillors. Sometimes children have been sent to homes as far as 60 miles or more from the Bristol area because Bristol’s current children’s homes are too large, and not suitable for their needs. We know that for most children in care it is better to be closer to home, near their family and communities and where they can be supported by local social workers.\n“Sending children far from home can be disruptive for them, and it is also more expensive for the Council. I am proud that my amendment has helped our dedicated children’s services officers make this change to ensure that what we offer matches what our children need, and make the best possible use of the limited resources we have.”\nGreen Councillor Carla Denyer said:\n“It’s great to see Eleanor’s excellent amendment from last February being put into practice. By providing more children’s homes here instead of sending children across the country for care, we’ll save money and provide a better service – it’s a win-win. Clever, common sense amendments like this that make the city a better place are a great example of the value of having Greens in local government.”",

A massive overhang of private bank debt goes a long way to explain why banks are not lending and why private sector investment is stalling.\n“The Group also predicted the ‘triple crunch’: a credit-fuelled financial crisis, combined with accelerating climate change and growing energy insecurity, which would “develop into a perfect storm, the like of which has not been seen since the Great Depression”.\n“So it has come to pass – we’re now in the sixth year of a widespread, international depression, with 2.5 million unemployed in the UK, many millions more under-employed, and youth unemployment at tragic levels.\n“The impacts of the climate crisis are becoming ever clearer, with 2012 going down in history as a year in which our weather spun out of control\n– and having carelessly assigned the nation’s energy security to the invisible and unaccountable ‘hand of the market’, we face an insecure energy future with all the economic implications that brings.\n“A programme of productive investment financed by loans from the government’s own nationalised bank – the Bank of England – is a crucial way to reduce the public debt, channelling public money into projects such as a comprehensive programme for retrofitting Britain’s ancient housing stock, increasing our energy security and reducing bills.\n“THIS IS NOT INDISCRIMINATE SPENDING, BUT ‘TRANSITIONAL INVESTMENT’, WHERE ENERGY AND MATERIALS ARE FOCUSSED ON INVESTMENT IN INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WILL LEAD TO A REDUCTION OF DEMAND FOR THEM IN THE FUTURE.\n“A public works spending would succeed where traditional quantitative easing has failed – going straight to help employment and companies, and the projects which can add to national well-being, generating income through employment.”\nTHE GREEN MP WILL CONCLUDE:\n“Keynes argued and proved that such spending would pay for itself.

Dr Scott Cato, a member of the agriculture committee in the European Parliament, has said the new government must enact policies to help small and medium-sized farms that operate in ways that respect workers, the environment and animals.\nThe European Parliament has appealed to both the EU Commission and EU governments to stop the further concentration of Europe’s agricultural areas and protect small and medium sized farms from corporations and speculators. Dr Scott Cato points to opportunities post-Brexit to develop alternative models of farming which support small family farms, which are particularly prevalent in her South West constituency. She said:\n“Landgrabbing for financial investment and industrial agricultural production has long been considered a problem for developing countries. But Europe faces the same issue. Large investors are using arable land as an investment opportunity. Just 3% of farms control more than 52% of arable land in Europe and 80% of CAP subsidies go to just 20% of farms. The European Parliament is right to call time on this perverse situation [1].”\n“As we prepare to leave the EU and the Common Agriculture Policy, the UK could become pioneers of a new farming model that redirects funds away from large land holders and corporation and towards supporting family farms.”\nEarlier this year, Molly Scott Cato commissioned two reports which identified policy ideas for farming post-Brexit. She said:\n“Both reports envision a future in which soil health is protected and enhanced; where biodiversity and animal welfare is improved and where land use contributes to mitigating the impacts of climate change. They also both agree on the need to maintain or increase the amount currently received by farmers through the Common Agriculture Policy, but that this investment must be retargeted towards rewarding farmers not landowners and focused on providing funding for advice, training and farmer-led research and innovation”.\n[1] See report from Transnational Institute: Land grabbing and land concentration in Europe",

But we recognise that our service must change to meet this vital challenge and bear the extra regulatory costs we face.\nAs part of this, we are looking into bigger and better recycling containers and bags which don’t spill or break, as well as starting to collect soft plastics to be recycled.\nBristol Waste surveys have shown that still 40 per cent of Bristol’s black bin waste is recyclable, and the move from weekly to fortnightly collections has been one of the few measures to significantly increase recycling rates in the last two decades.\nPart of the consultation therefore considers whether we take the same approach as our neighbouring councils in South Gloucestershire and North Somerset – and a growing number of other authorities – and reduce the frequency of black bin collections.\nBin collections that are currently fortnightly could become less frequent; but first, we want to hear from you.\nOnce we have as many thoughts and ideas as we can get, we will start considering how we want the service to change.\nI want to reassure people that contrary to some misleading claims, nothing has been decided, but that’s not to say we aren’t looking at making our service better and looking for new ways to support repair and reuse.\nSoft plastic recycling will be coming soon, and we will be bringing in simpler and bigger storage containers or bags for recycling, no matter what.\nThis will mean you’ll have more space for your waste throughout the week.\nOur city recycling has decreased over the last few years so we have some way to go to hit government targets, but I am confident we can improve on this together.\nThis is an opinion piece by Martin Fodor, Green Party councillor for Redland and chair of the environment & sustainability policy committee at Bristol City Council\nCllr Martin Fodor is the Chair of the Environment and Sustainability Committee\nMore about Martin",

The original motion resolved to restate the climate emergency, back the Mayor’s ‘One City Plan’ and for council party group leaders to write letters to their party leaders for support. Labour party members in the public gallery also called for concrete actions in the Public Forum section of the meeting.\nThe Greens proposed an amendment that added requests for the Council administration to commit to implement policies proposed by the Green New Deal Group and those suggested by Friends of the Earth, such as:\n– Ensure every decision made by the Council is compatible with the Climate Emergency and the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals\n– Begin work on a Congestion Charge or Workplace Parking Levy to raise funds and support cleaner, cheaper public transport\n– Halt major roadbuilding, which contributes to more traffic and carbon emissions – prioritise infrastructure that will improve quality of life and make it easier for people to get out of their cars\n– Write stronger Local Plan policies to make all new developments on private and Council land ‘climate emergency-proof’\n– Use the Council’s influence on the multi-billion pound Avon Pension Fund to fully divest out of fossil fuels and into renewables and low-carbon housebuilding\n– Oppose Bristol Airport expansion\nHowever the amendment was voted down by Labour and Conservative Councillors and the original motion passed. Green councillor Carla Denyer proposed the amendment, and has also co-proposed a motion on the Green New Deal to the Green Party Autumn Conference. She said:\n“We tried to work with Labour on their motion because the Green New Deal is so important – it has the potential to be a powerful project that transforms the UK, tackling environmental and social injustice and building the kind of Green future we need, not the climate crisis we’re heading towards. Signing up to the Green New Deal means committing to actually carry out Green New Deal policies, not just writing to people to ask them to support it. So I proposed an amendment to Labour’s motion which added practical, achievable actions from the UK Green New Deal group and Friends of the Earth, that the council could take on now, as well as calling for support for the more complicated things like changing the economy.”\nGroup leader Eleanor Combley said:\n“When we declared a Climate Emergency last year I had high hopes that the Mayor got the message: in this environmental crisis, Bristol needs action, not words, and needs it now, not in the distant future. Unfortunately once again tonight the Mayor and Bristol Labour showed that they are happy to talk the talk on climate change, while voting down real actions proposed by the Greens to deal with it. A Green New Deal is not an empty slogan to put on leaflets – it is a plan to tackle the climate crisis that features real policies like divesting from fossil fuels, or using funds from a workplace parking levy to fund public transport improvements – work we could get started on right away. Instead, in this motion, the Labour administration hide behind the things they can’t do because central government hasn’t yet given us the funding or the powers.\n“Let’s be clear – we have just 11 years to act. Central Government are woefully adrift from their own targets, and therefore I am happy to join calls for the powers and the funding we need and ‘reiterate’ the climate emergency as suggested by the motion. But there are actions this council can take now, and this motion’s ‘wait for government’ approach is just not good enough.”\nBackground\nThe Full Green Amendment to the Labour motion can be read here. Labour’s original motion is here.\nAmong other changes, the Green Group’s amendment to Labour’s motion added a section into the Motion under ‘Full Council resolves’ that called on the administration to “begina Green New Deal for Bristol by committing to actions, as proposed by the Green New Deal group and Friends of the Earth, that are currently within its powers, including:",

The Brunel Partnership is a conglomeration of 10 pension funds worth a total of £28 billion, including the Avon Pension Fund that covers Bristol City Council and other local authorities in the area.\nThe campaign for large institutional local pension funds to divest from fossil fuels has been running for years – two years ago Green councillors in Bristol proposed a successful motion to Full Council which called on the Council to lobby the Avon pension fund to divest and diversify from fossil fuels. The recent update from the Brunel Partnership showed significant investments in cleaner energy projects, and tougher ethical and sustainable criteria for all new investments, but slow progress towards actual divestment of funds away from fossil fuels.\nCouncillor Fodor said:\n“This was always going to be a slow process but I’m glad to see that progress is starting to be made as large funds begin to shift towards renewables. It’s great that following our campaigning, more money from these funds will be going to environmentally sound energy projects, and that more green criteria are being used for all new funding received. We’re going to keep the pressure up for clearer reporting and monitoring, to prove fossil and carbon liabilities are being eliminated. At the end of the day we want to see evidence that people’s money is going to the right places, not just engagement with companies promising incremental action in the face of climate warnings. Real action is urgently needed to achieve the Paris climate targets and head off runaway climate change.\n“But it doesn’t end here. We’ve been campaigning around large institutional funds like the Avon Pension Fund. But now the UK government has changed its rules for private pension funds, anyone can write to their pension provider and have their say on where their money is being invested. Environmental, social and governance issues are valid factors to help ensure the funds are fulfilling their long term fiduciary (pension investment return) obligations. Not only that, but asking your provider to divest from fossil fuels will help support a UK-wide shift into renewable energy. Pension funds are incredibly powerful investors and collective action from enough people will help to push them to focus on long term risks and opportunities for the benefit of the whole country.”\nThe second largest trade union in the country, Unison, also supports the campaign. Unison members in the area form a significant percentage of the pension fund membership. A representative from the Bristol branch of Unison gave the following statement:\n“The Bristol Unison branch has actively supported this campaign since its early days and made its own request to Avon Pension Fund (APF) to move its endowment away from fossil fuel companies, and towards investment in renewable energy. We were delighted when the National conference of Unison also voted in June 2017 to seek divestment of Local Government Pension Schemes from fossil fuels. The current effects of Climate Change are hitting the poorest, least empowered workers in the world the hardest and Unison recognises that they need our support. We are delighted to see that, at last, there is a move in APF towards more positive investment in renewables. We look forward to hearing of further progress towards complete divestment from fossil fuels.”\nBackground:\n– In December 2015 Green councillors in Bristol put forward a successful motion to Full Council which called on the Council to lobby the Avon pension fund to divest and diversify away from fossil fuels. (https://www.bristolgreenparty.org.uk/news/council-votes-for-fossil-free-pensions)\n– Earlier this year Bristol University announced new plans to divest its endowment fund from the most carbon intensive fossil fuel sectors, following campaigning and Court motions submitted by Green councillor Carla Denyer (https://www.bristolgreenparty.org.uk/news/bristol-university-announces-divestment-plans)",

The Greens are calling upon Bristol’s Mayor to take a leading role in opposing national austerity alongside other cities, networks, unions and progressive parties. They have also put forward an alternative vision for local government financing, including calls for a return of unallocated business rates to local government and for Bristol to receive its fair share of infrastructure spending.\nLeader of the Green Councillor Group, Charlie Bolton said:\n“Further cuts to the council will destroy many of the public services we all rely on. Services for older people, those with disabilities, our young people and children will all be slashed. Local traffic schemes that keep our children safe as they walk to school, well-loved library services and the parks that provide the ‘green lungs’ for our city will all be affected.”\n“But it doesn’t have to be like this. These cruel cuts to our services are a choice that is being made by this Tory Government – to dismantle our public services instead of raising money by closing tax loopholes, reforming our finance system, bringing good growth to our economy or increasing tax for the top 1%. Essential public services are being abandoned, yet Government remains committed to the soaring costs of replacing Trident, building a new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point and developing the HS2 vanity project. (2)”\nMolly Scott Cato, MEP, Green Party Economics Spokesperson and Green Parliamentary Candidate for Bristol West said:\n“We know austerity is a downward spiral. As you cut the state you reduce job quality and tax revenue, leading to less money available for investment, which in turn cuts the state still further. It’s time to say loud and clear that austerity has failed and that we value our public services and believe they should be properly funded.”\nTony Dyer, Green Party Local Government Spokesperson and Green Parliamentary candidate for Bristol South added:\n“Many of our cities are being disproportionally affected by Tory cuts. Bristol has already suffered three times more cuts than neighbouring authorities (3). The 10 Core Cities outside London are all run by Labour. They are home to almost 19 million people and contribute more than a quarter of the combined wealth of England, Wales and Scotland – so why aren’t we seeing more vocal opposition to this latest unjust assault on our services?

Does the Mayor understand the critical importance of the UK sticking to its carbon emissions targets, to prevent abrupt and irreversible changes that will wreck livelihoods and make the economy the least of our worries, as we face more of the droughts, crop failures, disease and flooding that we are already seeing on all continents?\n2. In light of the recent analysis that has shown that airport expansion disproportionally benefits the richest 10% while harming us all through climate change, air pollution and noise pollution; and in light of the recently agreed expansion of Heathrow Airport, which puts the UK on a trajectory to miss its carbon emissions targets unless drastic actions are taken; will the Mayor reconsider his previous position of supporting the expansion of Bristol Airport?\nAnother Green councillor, Charlie Bolton, questioned the Mayor in January 2018, during an earlier consultation about airport expansion, highlighting how the increase in the airport’s capacity – which would see passenger numbers more than double from 8 million to 20 million – contradicts local and national climate targets. At the time he said,\n“I asked the Mayor about this at the last Full Council and in response he suggested he supports both meeting our climate targets and expanding the airport, which is quite frankly impossible to reconcile. Making encouraging sounds about climate commitments while blithely agreeing to more air travel is trying to have your cake and eat it. Much like Theresa May it seems the Mayor simply doesn’t want to face up to the unpleasant reality that our climate change targets are incompatible with further expanding airports and air travel in the UK.”\n“Political evasion on this issue isn’t helping anyone.”\nCouncillor Denyer has also submitted a motion to next week’s Full Council meeting, calling on the Mayor to use his influential position to hold the airport to account on its emissions, to ensure the region keeps its commitments. The Joint Spatial Plan – which includes North Somerset and the geographical area covered by the airport – contains an explicit commitment to making a 50% cut in emissions by 2036. But the airport has been accused of ‘greenwash’ for publicising a 2030 carbon neutral target with no plan in place, and which does not include the emissions from aeroplanes themselves.\nShe commented: “This is an equality issue as well as an environmental one. According to the Civil Aviation Authority’s passenger surveys, 47% of the UK population has flown in the last year, and this figure has been stable over the last 15 years. Most of those people only make one or two trips per year, while 10% of the population makes about 60% of all flights, and these people are mainly from the highest income groups. This means that airport expansion disproportionally benefits the wealthy but negatively affects us all through climate change, air pollution and noise pollution. So I cannot understand how a Labour Mayor can justify his position of backing airport expansion.”\nIn the recent vote in Parliament over the expansion of Heathrow, Bristol’s Labour MPs were divided, with two voting against, one voting for, and one not present.\nNotes:\n– Councillor Denyer’s exposé of the Airport’s misleading claims and lack of a plan for decarbonisation: https://bristolgreenparty.org.uk/news/bristol-airport-carbon-targets-worthless-without-roadmap-say-greens\n– Councillor Bolton’s question to Marvin Rees in January 2018, during the last round of the consultation, and the Mayor’s answer: https://bristolgreenparty.org.uk/news/greens-say-we-all-need-to-challenge-airport-expansion.

  "https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_/https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_reboot-democracy-with-citizens-assemblies/content_248.html": "menu\nGreen Councillors in Bristol have proposed putting decision making on some major issues in the hands of ordinary Bristolians through ‘Citizens’ Assemblies’ and other forms of participatory democracy.\nCitizens’ Assemblies are a way of empowering a representative group of citizens to make decisions on important issues. A group of citizens are carefully selected to be representative of demographics in their area, are given a specific topic to address or problem to solve, and meet multiple times, with access to expert advice, in order to produce policies most of them can agree on. Greens are bringing the proposal to a Full Council meeting on Tuesday 14 January, where it will be first motion to be debated.\nThe approach can be useful to produce consensus on complicated or controversial issues which politicians might be afraid to deal with effectively. For example, Ireland has convened Citizens’ Assemblies to discuss abortion and same sex marriage, both of which led to referenda and changes in the law.\nA pressing issue that a Citizens’ Assembly could tackle is climate change – something which Extinction Rebellion has long called for. Last year Greens proposed the successful motion that declared a Climate Emergency and committed the city to go carbon neutral by 2030. But over a year later they worry there has been little significant progress. They see a Citizens’ Assembly as a way of letting Bristolians lead the way on carbon neutrality, ensuring that nobody in the city is left out of important decisions. And a recent survey shows that 86% of the population of Bristol are concerned about climate change so Greens predict that politicians from other parties will be surprised by how enthusiastic Bristolians are for bold solutions.\nIn order to set out further details and funding the Green motion calls for the council to set up a working group to determine what types of participatory democracy are established and agree funding for them – with the proposal to trial at least two projects over the 2020-2021 financial year. The working group would include representation from all parties, community groups and people from Bristol’s different communities.\nGreen Councillor Paula O’Rourke is the motion’s proposer. She said:\n“I’m proud to be bringing this motion to next week’s Council Meeting – we’ve got a rare opportunity to break through the usual political process. Democracy doesn’t need to begin and end every few years when you vote. We have a chance to bring people into making the decisions that will affect them and re-energise local democracy.”\nIn order to support people in taking time from work to take part in a citizen’s assembly and ensure access for those on lower incomes, participants are often paid a stipend. As well as Citizens’ Assemblies, the motion calls for the council to look into participatory budgeting, a way of using a democratic process to allocate part of a local budget. In Paris the process has been used with some success to allocate 5% of the city’s annual budget. Cllr O’Rourke suggests in Bristol it could be trialled with area committees, giving local communities a say in how to allocate fees levied on new developments (known as CIL funding).\n“The Mayor often talks about engaging with people outside ‘the bubble’ of City Hall. This motion is a chance to make that a reality and allow ordinary Bristolians a say in making major decisions. I hope all parties will support it.”\nGreen Group leader councillor Eleanor Combley said:\n“I’m delighted we’re bringing this motion to Council – it has the potential to really open up democracy in Bristol. Some people asked us why we did not choose to debate Bristol Airport Expansion again. The honest answer is that we sadly see no sign of Labour changing their position on it, so while we have not given up on campaigning on the issue outside of the council chamber, we are pursuing a new motion at Full Council that we hope has a greater chance of getting the other parties on board and giving ordinary Bristolians a say in how our city deals with the climate emergency and meets our carbon target.\n“Labour had the opportunity to debate airport expansion with us at the Full Council meeting in December, but they made their position clear when the Mayor published repeated written statements in support of the expansion, and when they voted with Conservatives to stop that debate.\n“If I’m wrong and the Mayor has changed his view on Bristol Airport expansion, it’s up to him to show that by rescinding the statement of support that he sent to North Somerset planning authority and replacing it with clear opposition.”\nNotes:\n“Extinction Rebellion believes that part of the problem is the way electoral politics works:\nHere is how a Citizens’ Assembly on Climate and Ecological Justice can break the deadlock:",

It’s very, very frightening.”\nCouncillor Francis said\n“There are billions of pounds in this country and it’s not being directed correctly because we have a Conservative government. That’s what Conservative governments do.”\nShe also said services were struggling under the impact of austerity and social crisis, saying:\n“Frontline staff are being totally decimated by the workload, pressures, to keep going… over the pandemic many of us were working flat out – we haven’t stopped.

We must finally put an end to the pain of privatisation that has been inflicted by Labour, the Lib Dems and the Tories.

  "https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_/https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_decision-on-allotment-fees-deferred-following-previous-labour-administration-failures/content_57.html": "menu\nThe Public Health and Communities Committee has decided to defer a decision on increasing allotment fees, following widespread objection. A new proposal will be brought to the committee in their October meeting.\nThe decision to defer follows a rejected amendment from Labour councillors to increase allotment fees by only 50% of what was proposed in the original paper.\nThe Greens, who previously called in the controversial plans to more than double allotment fees, were in favour of this amendment, which was rejected from being heard on a legal basis.\nFollowing the deferral and rejected amendment, Green Councillors have said that they will work hard to ensure that councillors have more opportunity to shape and amend papers in the future.[1]\nGreens have also blamed the previous Labour administration for not implementing agreed gradual fee rises earlier.\nCllr Fi Hance, who sits on the Public Health and Communities Committee, said, “What we were faced with today were uneven and inequitable rent rises based on a flawed consultation process which the call-in committee never got to scrutinise.”\n“Whilst I am glad that the decision has been deferred, we desperately need to find a stopgap solution for a fair rent rise in 2025/26 to avoid the collapse of the service. This will give us time to work with officers and allotment holders on a more permanent solution to reset rents in a more equitable way.\n“It has been six years since allotment rents have risen and we still have no clear answer as to why the agreed raises in 2022 were never implemented by the previous Labour administration. Modest year on year increases would have saved all of this trouble.”\n“This is one example of many as to why the city’s finances as a whole are in such poor shape, as we are increasingly discovering. And yet, we have had no apology from Labour for their utter financial mismanagement.”\nLast week, Tony Dyer, Leader of Bristol City Council, announced that the council is £22m in deficit due to overspend. Greens blamed an unrealistic budget being set by the Mayor.\nConsidering this, the Greens on the Public Health and Communities Committee recognise that allotment fees must increase to take away pressure from other areas of council finances, but less than the disproportionate sudden increase proposed by the previous administration.\nCurrently, the allotment service from the council is subsidised with money from the parks department. [2] Because national rules means that the Council must give a year’s notice before any rise in fees is implemented, so no rises will come into place until autumn 2025 at the earliest.\nCllr Hance, continued “Regardless of the decision made here today, if the new Labour government pursues austerity and does not hand local authorities a lifeline, both the parks budget and the city’s budgets will slide further into deficit than they already are.”\nSpeaking on the way in which the decision was reached at the committee meeting, Cllr Cara Lavan, who also sits on the Public Health and Communities Committee, said, “While I agree that there needs to be a better way for Councillors to shape proposals and make amendments, I am confused as to why the Labour Vice-Chair of this committee has called today a ‘constitutional crisis’ when she has had more than enough time to change the papers in meetings with officers.”\n“Greens on this committee were only given sight of the papers on allotment rents one week before the meeting and have been working tirelessly on a way forward.

After repeatedly missing deadlines set by the national government which Greens warned could expose Bristol Council to legal challenge, Bristol’s Labour Mayor produced two options for public consultation at a Cabinet meeting on June 18. However, the evidence on the efficacy of the Mayor’s options was not released until 23 July, more than three weeks after the consultation was launched. The timescales produced by the Council showed that under Marvin Rees’ favoured options air quality would not reach legal limits until 2028 or 2029.\nPoor air quality in Bristol is responsible for around 300 early deaths per year. The impact on people’s health is highest in some of the poorest wards in the City, where rates of car ownership are also low. For example, according to a Council report, as much as 10% of deaths in Lawrence Hill are attributable to air pollution.\nGreen Councillors said the timescales were unacceptable and said they would not be supporting either of the proposed options in the Council’s consultation, which closes on Monday 12 August. They called on the Mayor to urgently bring forward new proposals to improve air quality as fast as possible, and introduce measures to reduce private car use in the city centre, such as a congestion charge for out of town commuters which they proposed at the Council’s budget meeting in February.\nFi Hance, Green councillor and former Cabinet Member said:\n“It’s now been 1000 days since the Council passed a Green motion to deal with air pollution in Bristol and the Labour administration has run up against the latest of multiple missed deadlines. Asking Bristolians to wait as long as a decade to scrape by the bare minimum air quality standards is simply not good enough when toxic air causes 300 early deaths per year in this city. Instead of a false choice between two dubious options, rushed through at the last minute without evidence to support them, we urgently need new, tougher plans to clean up our air faster. The Labour Mayor’s failure to deliver clean, breathable air and treat this issue with the seriousness it deserves is hurting some of the poorest people in the city the most. Just as Bristolians responded ‘none of the above’ to the Council’s consultation on which libraries to close, my response to the Council’s clean air consultation is that neither option is good enough – we have to do more.”\nCouncillor Hance added:\n“But we also need more than a short term fix that achieves the legal minimum. Private cars are responsible for the majority of air pollution in Bristol, and as well as nitrogen dioxide cars produce harmful particulates that aren’t accounted for in the Council’s plans. We have to face up to the fact that any policy that doesn’t reduce private car use in the city centre is just tinkering around the edges. As well as tough clean air measures as soon as possible, we also need to make big improvements to walking and cycling in Bristol. Places that have done this, like Waltham Forest in London, are already seeing improvements in air quality and life expectancy. To help people out of their cars we also need to overhaul public transport – a congestion charge for out-of-town commuters coming into Bristol as proposed by Greens would reduce traffic, improve bus journey times, and give us millions to spend on improvements to our bus network.”\nThe Council’s Clean Air consultation can be found here and closes on Monday 12 August.",

The Green Party is urging the public to support their campaign to take back the Great Western franchise into public ownership, when the franchise expires in two years time. An e-petition calling for renationalisation of the franchise, launched last October, has already received 1200 signatures [2].\nGreens argue that a publicly-owned railway would lead to lower fares and lower subsidies from the taxpayer. They point to the success of the publicly owned Directly Operated Railways Company which operates the East Coast mainline franchise. The company has delivered £600 million to the Treasury and, while raising regulated fares by 3.1% under instruction from the government, their unregulated fares are only rising by an average 0.8%, a cut in real terms.\nThe petition to take back the Great Western franchise into public ownership was created by Professor Molly Scott Cato, lead Green Party European candidate in the South West. She said:\n“Yet again passengers are being hit with above inflationary rises in rail fares at a time when wages are stagnant and passengers in the UK are already paying some of the highest fares in Europe. For that they have to endure overcrowded trains and unreliable services. Ironically, profits from railway companies in the UK are skimmed off to be invested in trains and tracks in other countries. For example, train operating company Arriva is owned by Deutsche Bahn, which is in turn owned by the German government.”\n“There is now less than two years until the First Great Western franchise expires. This will provide the ideal opportunity to take back the franchise into public ownership. Taking back individual franchises when they expire, or when companies fail to meet their conditions, could save the Government over £1 billion a year every year. This is money that could and should be reinvested in services, and also used to reduce fares. We urge the public to support our campaign and sign our petition; it’s time to get our railways back on the right track and working for the common good.”\nThe Green Party is the only political party fully committed to the renationalisation of the railways. In the House of Commons, the Green MP Caroline Lucas has a Private Members’ Bill aimed at achieving renationalisation which is listed for its second reading on February 28th 2014 [3].\nNotes\n[1] Green Party members will be leafleting at Bristol Temple Meads, Swindon, Stroud, Taunton, Exeter St David’s and Exeter Central stations.\n[2] e-petition: Take back the Great Western franchise into public ownership http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/petitions/56244\n[3] Caroline Lucas Private Members’ Bill: http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/2013-2014/0081/14081.pdf",

He said:\n“I feel emotional about bringing this motion to Full Council, because I know how it feels to lose people in your life – a son, sister, brother, friends or someone you know closely or from a distance. When people pass away tragically and suddenly the effects are felt deeply – no matter how hard we try to forget about it, it can leave a deep psychological and emotional scar time will not erase.”\nFellow Green Councillor Yassin Mohamud said knife violence was a key issue in his ward of Lawrence Hill, where teenager Dontae Davis was fatally stabbed in 2021. He echoed Cllr Makawi’s sentiments, saying:\n“Knife crime is amongst the most serious issues for our young people. The permanent psychological pain it leaves on both the victim and culprit’s memories, together with that of their families, is far much greater than the physical scars it leaves on the victim’s body. Therefore, we need not only to tackle issues around knife crime but we need to address the root causes too.”\nRather than simply calling for more policing, the Green motion seeks to address the varied causes of knife violence which have a range of social factors. Councillor Makawi explained:\n“We all wish that there was just one thing that we could do to stop knife violence. But there are no shortcuts and there is no one single solution. Media-driven ‘moral panic’ pushes politicians towards the wrong solutions. The indicators of this violence include social factors like poverty, domestic abuse, lack of education (particularly expulsion from school) and grooming by gangs.”\nThe motion’s full list of actions resolves to:\nCouncillor Makawi added:\n“I don’t believe increased police numbers and tougher prison sentences are the only solution to the problem. It’s not about Stop & Search it should be about Stop & Engage – about engagement with the communities, local councillors, schools, stakeholders, police teams and regulatory services like licensing.”\nGoing into more detail, the Green Councillor said:\n“I think a youth and family prevention approach is needed to build community resilience. This could include support for parents to help their children develop skills and personal resilience and steer them away from violence, and increase awareness of warning signs. It’s also important to support grassroots projects that work with young people vulnerable to grooming by gangs – providing activities, employment and educational intervention as an alternative to serious youth violence and criminality. This could include youth provision organisations like such as Learning Partnership West, Youth Moves, Creative Youth Network, Bristol Somali youth organisations, Full Circle Project, groups in the Sudanese and Gambian communities and the Malcom X centre.\n“Finally, we also need to work with trusted youth workers and influential peers, and engage in serious positive conversations with the hardcore of young people already carrying knives to try and get them out of gangs and rehabilitated. This needs a multi-agency approach, and support across sectors, working with the community to create an effective intervention. We have to put the community at the heart of the solution and provide the resources to make it happen.”\nAni Stafford-Townsend is the Green Councillor for Central ward, which contains a large proportion of Bristol’s night time venues and some areas of areas of concern for knife violence, and contributed to the motion. They said:\n“Knife crime is a continuous concern for residents and those working centrally in the night time economy. Sometimes the incidents are fatal, as we sadly saw this year in Castle Park. We must do as much as we possibly can as a city to protect our young people from the impacts and causes of knife crime.”\nCouncillor Makawi said he hoped all parties will support the motion at next Tuesday’s meeting, adding:\n“Tackling this serious violence requires co-ordinated action on multiple fronts, from all parts of the public sector. Politics can be divisive, but if there was ever an issue to unite our efforts and inspire us to stand together, then surely this is it.”",

It challenges politicians to demonstrate support for this key industry which has huge potential for the creation of jobs as well as offering opportunities to reduce carbon emissions.\nMolly Scott Cato said:\n“Mixed messages on support for the low-carbon economy is undermining investment in these important sectors and destroying jobs in the South West. Already the South West has lost the Atlantic Array in the Bristol Channel, an off-shore 1.4 Gigawatt wind farm project capable of supplying clean energy equivalent to that used by 900,000 homes.

Low carbon manufacturing is a further source of jobs that can be delivered by accessing EU funding alongside the private investment that the Mayor and others are already attracting.

They argued for stronger planning rules on climate change – for example policy text making clear commitments to carbon neutrality rather than just aspiration. The Greens also raised concerns about weaker protections for public land in the new plan and called for planning policies against advertising billboards and over-concentration of student housing in small areas of the city.\nCouncillor Martin Fodor helped draft the plan response. He said:\n“The local plan isn’t very well known about but it’s a really important document that sets the council’s policy for all planning, having a huge influence on the shape of our city – and it is generally only updated about every 10 years, so it must deal with the challenges of future rather than the problems of the past. We’ve recommended some big changes to the council’s draft plan: stronger protections for green spaces, policies to restrict the impact of airbnb lettings on residents, and most importantly the need for much tougher climate action. It will be interesting to see what proposed changes are taken on board.”\nLeader of the green group, Councillor Eleanor Combley said:\n“Last year the council passed our climate emergency motion, with all councillors including the Mayor voting for an ambitious target of Bristol going carbon neutral by 2030. Now we have to follow through by ensuring that reducing emissions is part of our internal policies and decision making across the whole of the council. We need a Green New Deal for Bristol – this could lay the groundwork, or it could be another strategy for business as usual. I hope the council makes the right decision.”\n“As we’ve seen from the passion of the Youth Climate Strikes and the rapid growth of Extinction Rebellion, people are ahead of politicians on these issues. With the local plan we have an opportunity to put tough climate change action right at the heart of the council’s policy – where it has to be if we’re going to recognise the scale and importance of the climate emergency facing us.”\nExamples of other changes proposed by the Green Group include:",

The latest spate of extreme weather has affected not just the UK, but all 4 continents currently experiencing summer, with record-breaking heatwaves sweeping countries as far apart as Japan, Sweden, Canada, South Korea and Algeria.\nBristol has a resilience strategy and is committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2050, but Green councillors are calling for shorter term targets to be made clearer and for Bristol’s carbon neutral vision to feed into all decision-making within Bristol City Council.\nCouncillor Charlie Bolton said:\n“Climate change predicts more extreme weather events, and this is exactly what we are seeing. Our city is demonstrating a lack of resilience to this period of hot weather – be it people being unable to sleep, our waste collections struggling to cope or the grass in our parks dying.”\n“A long-term vision is all very well, but we also need concrete action now to help our city both adapt to and help address climate change. The Mayor has set up a City Office which is tasked with delivering on our resilience strategy. It’s over two years since the election and we all know what needs to be done – so let’s stop talking about it and get on and do it.”\n“Just saying we are a cycling city does not make it true. We need the networks and the training to go with it. But we also need to be a walking city, and a bus and train city. Our hugely ambitious house building programme must make sure that all new homes contribute to making Bristol a more carbon-neutral city and the city needs to be putting in place energy efficiency retro-fitting schemes as soon as possible. We need much, much more renewable energy generation that provides clean, green energy for everyone. And we don’t need these things in the coming decades – we need them now.”\n“But what we need most of all is the political will to prioritise climate change action, even if this means upsetting the car lobby to get a charging zone in our city centre, or being brave enough to oppose expansion of Bristol airport, or not shying away from effective action to reduce our city’s waste. We need climate change to be part of the conversation in every decision made by our council if we are to make real progress towards becoming the clean, green, carbon neutral city we know that Bristol can be.”",

  "https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_/https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_is-the-green-party-a-single-issue-party/content_888.html": "If you ask what “being green” means, most people will first think of recycling, perhaps taking showers instead of baths, or maybe fitting some LED light-bulbs. Others might move onto promoting ‘FSC’ wood, ‘MSC’ fish and vegetarianism. These are noble goals. But the Green Party’s end goal is not to make environmentally friendly tweaks to the current neoliberal economic model. As a political party we recognize that climate change is not simply an individual or an environmental issue, climate change is being fueled by the rigid adherence to an economic and political model that values greed and growth more than anything else. This economic model is threatening our ability to sustain our standards of living through environmental damage, and is corrupting our relationship to our environment and each other, to one of exploitation and competition. The Green Party doesn’t want a more environmentally friendly version of the current system. The Green Party was borne out of a recognition that the system we work within is the root cause of many of our problems, and undermines our ability to tackle climate change.\nThe UK establishment is still stuck with its pernicious, blind faith in the market. Since Thatcher came to power the UK has been dominated by a vision of setting the market free, with the hope that the private sector would lift society as a whole. As we face record levels of inequality, systemic failures in our banking sector, and tax avoidance on a massive scale, it is time to question our faith in the free hand of neoliberal economics. The recent tax avoidance scandal at HSBC is a timely reminder that the supposed ‘free hand’ of the market is more likely to slap itself in the face, or pat itself on its back, than provide an effective means of organizing our economy.\nThe path away from climate change will require a different model for thinking about how we organize our society. We CAN act collectively to invest in a different future. We CAN have a New Green Deal to recharge the UK economy to create jobs and genuine wealth, while lowering the cost of living.\nThis new wave of Green investment will require a new vision for thinking about how money is created into the economy. Ben Dyson and Positive Money have been leading the way in raising awareness of the fact that the ability of banks to create money as debt is doing little except fuel a property bubble. Positive Money is calling for the money supply to be in public hands, such that the productivity of our society can be reinvested in the real economy rather than just servicing the debt of private banks.\nUnderlying this change in the way we create money is a more fundamental recognition that markets need to be more strongly shaped by government to ensure they work for the common good. Many citizens would prefer to make more rational long term choices within the market, for example, investing in a more efficient boiler, insulating their homes, or installing solar panels, but people have to pay banks so much in debt repayments that they simply don’t have the spare capital to be making these choices, even when these choices would pay off for everyone in the long term. Taking back control over the way in which banks create money as debt could help to ensure that we are structuring the market in a way that the wealth generated in our society goes back into the real economy.\nIn parallel to questioning our faith in the market, we also need to re-evaluate what market activity is actually for. For decades we have chased ever increasing GDP, but there is no evidence that increase in GDP in the developed world leads to an increase in overall levels of well being. The recent publication ‘The Spirit Level’ suggests that equality is actually a more important factor, such that in a more equal society, even the rich do better. Moreover it makes the case that equality between the rich and poor predicts better public health, mental health, and almost any other metric for well-being (in the developed world). In our hearts, we know that continual growth (or the accumulation of more money) is not what brings satisfaction to our lives. Rather we want to live in a positive relationship with our neighbours and our environment. We want to live in clean, green, safe environments. We want meaningful jobs where we feel we are genuinely contributing something. Rather than chasing endless growth for its own sake, we need to focus on the fact that we cannot divorce the economic system from human values and the health of the planet.\nUltimately we need to remember the current free market model of continual growth in GDP fueled by greed, has the potential to subject us to runaway climate change. If we don’t have the foresight to recognize it in advance, we will soon be confronted with a world in which failing crop harvests, water shortage and other resources scarcities, combined with violent and unpredictable weather will force us to realize that the environment was never a separate issue. By the time this happens however it will be 40 years too late.\n[This is a reproduction of Darren’s first blog in the Huffington Post]",

Her comments come after a report found that Bristol’s BME community are more disadvantaged than in any other UK core city.\nThe latest study from the Centre on Dynamics of Ethnicity (CDE) and the race equality think tank, Runnymede Trust, measured the ‘ethical penalty’ faced by BME populations across the UK. It found that of the ten core cities studied, Bristol’s BME communities have the worst opportunities in terms of employment, health and education.\nMolly Scott Cato said:\n‘There is a growing body of evidence that Bristol’s BME community are significantly disadvantaged. This report represents a reminder of the ongoing challenge to all local politicians to do better by black and ethnic minority communities in the city.\n‘Multiculturalism and diversity are greatly respected in Bristol. It is also a compassionate city, as demonstrated by the fact refugees have for decades been welcomed to the city. And now we see Bristol West with the highest number of signatories of anywhere in the country signing a petition calling for Donald Trump to be barred from a state visit to the UK following his executive order preventing refugees to the US.\n‘However, we must not be complacent about the fact that in economic terms we continue to be a very unequal society, and specifically, it is the Afro-Caribbean and Somali communities who are losing out in Bristol.’\nThe report calls for a national race equality action plan, an idea welcomed by Molly Scott Cato:\n‘In Bristol there already exists a plan that sets objectives to improve educational and employment opportunities for BME groups in Bristol, a plan developed and produced by those best equipped to understand what needs to be done – Bristol’s BME groups themselves. Additionally, we need to look at how the national curriculum can be better tailored to the needs and experiences of BME groups, how we can recruit more teachers from BME backgrounds and how to better engage with BME parents. Workplaces need to be welcoming to BME people and reflect the ethnic diversity of the communities in which they operate.\nThe recent tasering by police of Ras Judah Adunbi, a respected elder within the BME community, has highlighted the continuing divisions in our community. We must look to be building bridges between the BME community in Bristol and those in power. I know Bristol’s Mayor Marvin Rees takes these issues incredibly seriously. I also know he is working within Bristol to implement many of the recommendations of the Bristol Manifesto for Racial Equality, but it is also clear that there is a need for action at a national level. I, therefore, hope he will support, and indeed champion, the call for a national race equality plan.’",

The report also highlights how student loans are exacerbating the generation divide because the debt load is being used to secure the private pensions of the elderly, many of whom previously benefited from free higher education.\nMolly said:\n“This report exposes just what a huge swindle student loans are. All three main Westminster parties are guilty of engineering this swindle; they have all betrayed our young people, condemning them to a life of debt. Student fees began under Labour, who subsequently tripled them. They were then tripled again under the Conservative and Lib Dem coalition government.\n“Generation debt is now also funding the pensions of generations who enjoyed free higher education. The sell-off of student debt to private corporations is being used to secure private pensions; another clear example of how government policy is exacerbating the generation divide in our society.\n“Other countries in the EU and around the world recognise and value the benefits free education. If they can manage to fund this using taxes, so can we here in the UK.\n“The Green Party recognises the value that higher education brings to individuals, wider society and our economy. We will scrap university tuition fees and cancel all student debt issued by the Student Loans Company and held by the government. We will reestablish full student grants and make greater public investment in further and higher education.

Read more here >>>\n———————————————————————————————————————————-\nDarren Hall, the Green Party candidate for the West of England Metro Mayor Elections has been excluded from a hustings event.\nThe hustings has been organised by Centre for Cities and Business West, the region’s Chamber of Commerce, who have set criteria based on previous parliamentary election votes, even though this is for Metro Mayor which has never seen an election before.\nThe Green Party has been told that only four candidates will be invited, in the order of Labour, Conservatives, Liberal Democrats and UKIP. They added “If an Independent comes forward it will be based on the ‘merit’ of their chance of winning”.\nDue to the criteria being based solely on votes not related to this position, UKIP would be invited over the Green Party even though the Greens have 12 elected Councillors in the combined authority compared to UKIP’s zero.\nThe event will also happen over two weeks before the deadline for declarations, further disenfranchising more diverse candidates.\nDarren Hall has called the criteria “ill thought through” and “a disservice to democracy”\n“I think this decision is doing a disservice to all the voters here and totally undermines Centre for Cities credibility as non-partisan organisation. Democracy and elections are about choice, about allowing voters to hear from all the candidates. This ill-thought through criteria based upon a set of largely irrelevant historical results does exactly the opposite; it stops the voters having an informed choice for an incredibly important new role for which all the candidates should be judged”\n“I’m very surprised and disappointed that Business West seem to be supporting Centre for Cities on this issue. There has never been a Metro Mayor before and basing attendance on a completely different role makes no sense at all. The Metro Mayor will be mostly working with councils and councillors, an area that the Green Party has a proud history of succeeding in. The green agenda deserves to be properly represented.”\n“The diverse nature of the politics in this area has the right to be heard and respected.

Co-leader, Caroline Lucas MP and Green MEP, Molly Scott Cato, will pledge a ‘ratification referendum’ providing people a clear choice between accepting the deal on offer at the end of the Article 50 process or remaining a member of the EU [1].\nGreens say this will not be a re-run of the in-out referendum but will be a vote about the ratification process. Speaking at the launch in London, Dr Scott Cato will say:\n“Greens believe that the people of the UK must be given an opportunity to have their say through a ratification referendum. It is a democratic requirement that when we get to the end of the negotiating process, and we see what Brexit really means, as opposed to a series of promises that cannot be fulfilled, we have a chance to decide whether that it better than continued EU membership.\n“Take back control was the strap line which persuaded many to vote Leave in the referendum last year. It’s now clear what that meant. A power grab by the Tory right so they can make a bonfire of regulations which protect our rights and environment and an opportunity to hand control to powerful corporations and wealthy elites; turning us into a tax haven.\n“A ratification referendum is the chance to give back control.”\nMolly Scott Cato will also hit out at Labour’s approach to Brexit. She will say:\n“We should not be taken in by Labour’s apparently softer more considered approach to Brexit. Their message is confused and contradictory and still has some uncomfortable hard edges.\n“Taking a tough stance on freedom of movement is incompatible with membership of the single market. If Labour believe, like the Tories, that the fundamental rules of the club – such as the four freedoms – will be bent or watered down to accommodate a hardline UK, they clearly do not understand how the EU works.\n“Labour’s call for parliament to be given a truly meaningful vote on the final Brexit deal is welcome, but their reluctance to give British people the same right shows a blatant disregard for democracy.”\nMolly Scott Cato will say that voting Green will block hard Brexit, give people a real say on their future and offer a chance to vote to stay in the EU.\nTony Dyer, the Green Party Parliamentary Candidate for Bristol South commented,\n“During the referendum campaign, people were required to make a simplistic binary choice on a complex issue that will have a dramatic impact on their futures and their children’s futures. In the build up to making this choice, once again they were badly let down by the general standard of debate from politicians on both sides. As a result, people were forced to vote based on speculation and hype rather than hard facts.\nBut when the final deal is produced at the end of the Article 50 negotiations, it will be there in black and white, for all to see – although it is unlikely to be splashed across the side of a bus.\nTo leave the decision on whether to accept or reject this deal solely in the hands of those same politicians who failed to provide us with the standard of debate we needed during the EU referendum would be an abandonment of our responsibilities as citizens. That is why, the people of Bristol, and the country at large, should be given the right to vote on whether to ratify the resulting deal before it goes to parliament.\nWe, the people, need to take back control of our future. We, the people, need a ratification referendum to do that.”\nNotes\n[1] Details of ratification referendum pledge\nAt 10.30am tomorrow, Tuesday 2nd May, Caroline Lucas MP and Molly Scott Cato MEP will announce the Green Party policy on a further referendum. The announcement will be made at Space Studios in Hackney – a space benefitting from a £1m EU grant to support emerging artists through their training and bursary schemes, as well as the provision of gallery space.\nWHAT is the policy?\nThe Green Party will hold a ‘ratification referendum’ on Brexit once the terms of a deal have been agreed with the EU. Like any commercial deal, that referendum will give the public two clear choices: stick with what we have, or sign up to the deal on offer. And like any deal we will make sure those affected are involved: a Green referendum would give 16 and 17 year olds the vote, making sure that they have a say over their future instead of having that decision made for them.\nMolly Scott Cato is Green MEP for the South West of England and Gibraltar and is one of 50 Green/EFA MEPs in the European Parliament.

  "https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_/https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_green-response-to-the-parks-and-green-spaces-consultation/content_461.html": "menu\nThe Green Party in Bristol has made the following submission on the parks consultation.\nYou can participate here (but please note the deadline is 29th January):\nParks consultation\nBenefits of urban parks\nBristol’s parks and green spaces play a key role in any city, but particularly within Bristol. They act as a place to play, a place to rest, and a place to meet. They allow those on low incomes access to green space which otherwise they may not get. They cool the city when it is hot, they absorb water when there is heavy rain. They help mitigate and adapt to climate change. They help combat air pollution. They help increase biodiversity. They can have a role in allowing people in the city to get away from the noise and stress of the city which is vital for health and wellbeing. We regard it as a vital part of what makes Bristol special that we maintain a range of high quality green space in all parts of the city.\nAdditional Benefits of allotments\nWe also believe that our network of allotments plays an important role in allowing people to grow their own food at a location close to their home (which is therefore highly sustainable), be it done individually or communally.\nKeep them free!\nThe concept that our parks should be free to use must be enshrined as a fundamental and inviolable principle. We believe that charges for allotments should be kept to a minimum, and rises in charges should be kept to levels of inflation.\nMaking money from park cafes and concessions\nWe support measures to raise income from parks cafes by improving the offer. We do not believe this should mean significant price rises, but more an extension of the range of items offered. We also support the proportionate increase in numbers of concessions, but there must be a ‘healthy food’ strategy as part of this, in line with council policies.\nWe note the list of parks which currently have cafes. We assume there will be an analysis of the possibility of putting in cafes to other parks eg Greville Smyth.\nIn terms of who runs the cafes, we believe that there needs to be a strategy to encourage in house or local, independent concessions eg by letting individual sites not a chain of sites and monitoring social value around local supply chains. We DO NOT believe local concessions should be replaced by an in-house offer, without a very good justification for doing so – the council should be aiming to support local small business, rather than penalise it.\nParking charges\nWe support the introduction of parking charges in parks, with the proviso that those with mobility issues eg blue badge holders are exempt.\nAdvertising in parks\nWe oppose the introduction of advertising in parks. We believe that part of the role of a public park is to get away from the hurly-burly of city living and endless consumption, and this will negate this important benefit.\nAdvertising on roundabouts\nWe would discourage introducing billboard advertisements on new sites across the city – they encourage the draining of wealth and spending from the local economy to global corporations and the escalation of consumption that impoverishes communities.\nIntroduce fees for business operating from a park or green space eg dog walkers, fitness trainers and for balloons\nWe can envisage considerable difficulties in enforcing this, and, given the relatively small amounts of money expected to be raised wonder if the effort will be worthwhile. However, assuming there is a sufficient cost-justification, a licensing scheme should be considered as one option for charging commercial operators using our parks – with an obligation to demonstrate the license to operate when advertising their services in each location. (eg including a noticeboard listing the licensed and insured businesses approved for each park).\nIntroduce fee-paying activities into parks\nWe largely support this approach, as long as sufficient safeguards are put in place not to destroy the ambience of a park. A defined and limited area in each open space should be allocated so that the majority of space is not excluded from free access.\nIncreased income from larger fee-laying events\nWe have concerns that introducing ever higher fees for large events could result in the loss of some events (such as Vegfest) or the dominance of large scale corporate operators. Any increase in numbers of large scale events needs to take into account the impact on local residents. To go from one to two large scale events per year may be acceptable. To go from one to ten certainly is not.\nWe have further concerns that proposals to charge more for non-commercial events will impact on small scale community events. Community groups and volunteer organisations need to be given sufficient time and support to plan for their events, and need a predictable environment in which to do so. Failure to do so can result in them being forced to cancel events.\nMaintenance budget\nWe are seriously concerned about the impact of the major cuts to the parks maintenance budgets. Significant amounts have been cut from these budgets, and this will inevitably damage the appearance of local parks and reduce their quality. We are concerned at the seeming lack of detail over how these are being implemented. We are also concerned that they may take a park or green space below a minimum acceptable standard.\nUse of volunteers/Friends groups\nWe support the existence of Friends groups for parks. Local people with knowledge of their local park can play a key role in its development. However, volunteers have to be supported to be effective. They need support in all aspects of volunteering, and this may become an overhead in its own right. If we expect Friends groups or volunteers to take on more, the council needs to invest in them – this should include how we communicate with them, insurance, plant and equipment . It also needs to provide a service guarantee for works paid for by groups to ensure these are implemented without excess delays.\nCIL and parks\nWe believe that there are opportunities for the council, working in partnership with local groups, to seek further funding to go with CIL (Community Infrastructure Levy) applications. The department should be supporting this.\nWildlife areas\nWe would support the introduction or increase in well-created wildlife areas should there be a local will to do so.\nRingfencing of income raised by parks for parks\nThe raising of income for Bristol’s parks is a significant unknown, which may go badly, and conversely may go very well. Were it to be the latter, we believe that a significant proportion of income raised should be ring-fenced to be retained by parks. The idea that parks be a cash-cow for other services is quite wrong.\nCemetaries and crematoriums\nIt is difficult to comment on the proposals to raise money from the cemetaries and crematoriums service, without having a good understanding of the context of the proposals eg what is the cost and change in cost for a family who have to bury a loved one.\nHowever, in general terms, we make the following comments:\nCreation of a trust\nWe believe there needs to be significant further discussion before any trust be created for local parks. This would include, but not be limited to a council loss of control, its income raising potential, and the need a big dowry (depending on which parks are included).\nParks forum submission\nWe note and are generally supportive of the submission made by the parks forum.",
  "https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_/https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_green-councillor-objects-to-broadmead-car-park-plans/content_465.html": "menu\nBristol Green Councillor Jerome Thomas has put in a statement to one of the council’s planning committees objecting to the continued presence of a large multi-storey car park in city centre development plans. Green councillors support the development of Broadmead but are opposed to the large proposed car park, arguing that it will create more congestion and air pollution in the city centre and delay bus journey times.\nCllr Thomas said “Following pressure from Green councillors and a petition signed by almost 900 people, the Broadmead development proposals were rejected by the council planning committee in November due to the inclusion of a large car park with a disruptive access route. Now the developers have come back with a smaller car park – but the proposed access route off Bond Street means it would still create traffic delays and add to bus journey times, affecting almost all bus routes in the city. I’m aware that there is a need for increased disabled parking in the area but I’m sure the developers could come up with another solution to this.\nThere are already six multi-storey car parks adjacent to Broadmead and Cabot Circus and I don’t think developers have convincingly shown the need for another one. As a city we need to be encouraging public transport, cycling and walking in the city centre, not throwing up additional parking which will only make Bristol’s traffic problem worse. If this car park is going to be built then at the very least there should be an arrangement where it only opens as an overspill when the one at Cabot Circus is full.”\nBackground\n– As raised previously by Green councillors air pollution levels in the area around Broadmead are already above legal limits. High air pollution levels have a significant impact on health and are linked higher rates of asthma and poor lung development among children, and around 40,000 early deaths per year in the UK\nStatement from Cllr Thomas below:\nStatement from Councillor Thomas to Development Control Committee A regarding the proposed development of Callowhill Court car park\nFor meeting of 10 January 2018\nWhile welcoming the proposed redevelopment of Callowhill Court to enhance the vitality and safeguard the future of Broadmead I am concerned that the proposed car park at Callowhill Court will unnecessarily reduce the capacity of the city’s road network on Bond Street by up to 25-30% at peak times for vehicles travelling west, leading to increased bus journey and other vehicle journey times.\nIdeally I believe that the development should have no car park. The developers have shown insufficient evidence of the need for an additional car park and there are already six adjacent to the Broadmead and Cabot Circus area. Bristol already suffers with a great deal of congestion and in 2017 we need city planning that looks beyond outdated car-centric planning. If the Callowhill Court development has no car park this would encourage the use of public transport and promote cleaner air and reduced congestion in the city centre. However, if the development committee believes that there should be a car park, then this Callowhill Court car park of 380 spaces should only operate as an overspill car park for Cabot Circus (with 3,000 spaces). It should operate when Cabot Circus car park is in excess of 90-95% capacity utilisation. This will mean that for most of the times when there is city centre congestion, eg on weekday evenings, the Callowhill Court car park will not be operating and will not be adding to the city’s congestion problems.\nIt is possible that disabled car parking spaces will be required in Callowhill Court on an ongoing basis, irrespective of whether Cabot Circus is operating at capacity or not. This will minimise travel distances to the new development for people with disabilities. This access could be achieved, either through the goods vehicle left turning entrance (with appropriate electronic recognition of registered vehicles) or with the existing proposed lane configuration with digital signage indicating that the Callowhill Court car park is only open at non-capacity times for disabled car parking, and sensors on the traffic lights on the east-travelling Bond Street right turning lane detecting vehicles accordingly and operating the traffic lights appropriately.\nImposing this condition on the Callowhill Court car park, that it only operates when the Cabot Circus car park is at capacity, would be consistent with the requirement for planning conditions that they be precise, relevant and enforceable. It is also the kind of approach that should be straightforward for a city that claims to be ‘smart’.\nI have discussed this approach with Gary Collins, the Head of Development Management at BCC, with the head of planning at Hammersons, Phillipa Zieba, and with James Freeman, MD of First Bus. Supporting this approach could allow committee members to be both supportive of the development and show that they are serious about taking action to improve the city’s air quality and reduce the city’s traffic congestion problems.\nJerome Thomas\nGreen Party Councillor",

Green councillors have identified £1.7m that officers have now agreed could be used to reduce council cuts.\nIf agreed by other parties at next Tuesday’s budget vote, the money would be used to help reduce some of the worst cuts the city is facing, including cuts to the Local Crisis Prevention Fund which provides support for those at risk of being made homeless – this was due to be slashed by 55%.\nClifton Down councillor Clive Stevens, who identified that reallocating money earmarked to increase reserves in five years’ time could be more sustainably directed towards solving urgent budget pressures this year explains:\n“This additional money can, at no extra cost to the tax-payer, be used to give parks, libraries, and those charities that support the elderly and vulnerable, many of which face a funding crisis, time to transition to a more sustainable footing.”\n“Bristol City Council has paid off £36 million more debt than it was required to by the government’s accounting rules in the years between 2007 and 2016. Councillors had voted to change the repayment rules in December and the Greens have now identified that £1,767,000 can be reallocated to the revenue budget for this coming year 2017/18 where it is more urgently needed, and officers have accepted that argument.”\nAs well as taking action now to alleviate the existing crisis in funding caused by central government cuts to local government, the Greens are also looking to the future by using some of the funding to set up an Income Generation Unit to identify innovative ways in which the council can adapt to what will clearly be an increasingly difficult period for local services in major cities like Bristol.\nCllr Stevens added; “Conservative austerity economics have proved disastrous for our country and are now severely affecting our city. Unfortunately, the combination of an outmoded voting system and weak opposition in Westminster makes it unlikely we will see the desperately needed change in approach anytime soon.”\n“At the same time, this government appears to be committed to a “hard Brexit” – a move that will damage our trading relationship with the rest of Europe and will have a long term negative impact on the economy of a city like Bristol which sends 66% of its exports to the EU. Therefore it is vital that we scrutinise the council’s finances robustly in order to identify every viable opportunity to reduce the impact of the government’s cuts and build for the future – this budget amendment proposal is part of the Green group’s commitment to that process”\nClIfton Councillor Paula O’Rourke said “We need to make Bristol more financially resilient and ultimately self-financing in order to protect the most vulnerable in our city, as well as providing hope for a secure and prosperous future for the vast majority of Bristolians. To do that we need to develop the council’s ability to generate appropriate revenue in areas that the council has skills in, rather than simply being forced to continue hiking compulsory local charges. “\n“The Greens have identified this additional £1.7m of funding to help alleviate some of the worst impacts of Conservative cuts. We hope that Bristol’s Labour group will support our budget amendments to help reduce the impact of government cuts when our proposal is discussed at Full Council next week.”\nEND\nNotes:\nThe Green Party’s proposed budget amendments to Bristol City Council regarding the £1.7m can be found here:",

Gloucester road is one of the prime examples of a diverse high-street that is the life-blood of our independent traders. It is also one of the last streets in Bristol where there is a choice of grocers – a mega Sainsbury close by could destroy this precious resource, making local food even harder to come by.”\nDaniella Radice, Green Party Candidate for Bishopston, said:\n“Rejecting the Sainsbury’s application is about supporting our local livelihood and culture. Thousands flock to Gloucester Road every day of every year because it is unique – a jewel in Bristol’s crown. We can’t let one of Britain’s last remaining high streets get shut down.”\nGreens have further pointed out that information provided by Sainsbury’s during the initial consultation process was deceptive. Sainsbury’s initially gave the impression that the new store was comparable to their Winterstoke Road shop. In reality the retail floorspace will be larger than Eastville Tesco.\nBristol City Council is obliged by new planning legislation introduced by the coalition, to consider any damage new supermarkets will make to local high streets. As Bristol City Council’s report clearly states, the damage caused by the new Sainsbury’s will be considerable. Campaigners and Green Party members have stated their intention to therefore highlight this inconsistency and demand that BCC take serious note of the findings of the report.\nResearch has shown that small and medium sized businesses provide 30% more jobs per £100,000 in turnover than large businesses such as supermarkets. As well as providing more jobs, these businesses are more likely to be linked to other local businesses when developing products thereby ensuring a stable and growing local economy.\nA key committee meeting will take place next Wednesday at City Hall to which Daniella Radice will submit a statement as part of the TRASH action group.",

A majority of MEPs also voted for binding targets for recycling and a call on the European Commission to set up binding food waste targets.\nCommenting on the vote, Molly said:\n“As a Green Economist I have long argued for the need to move away from the linear economy based on extraction, production and disposal, which is wasteful of resources and energy. The time has come to move towards an energy and resource efficient circular economy, which will also provide enormous economic development opportunities, especially for SMEs.\nThere are many jobs to be created through waste products being either reused or recycled rather than simply dumped in landfill or burned. Combating planned obsolescence will also help consumers save money and have better quality products.\n“Reduction targets for food waste and stronger recycling targets add up to a package that will be good for citizens’ health, the environment, as well as for the economy.\nMolly, who is Green Party speaker on EU relations, concluded:\n“We must ensure that this sort of ambition is mirrored by our own government.

The last thing our city and the region needs is yet more carbon emissions from flights, more traffic congestion, more noise, and worsening air quality. We condemn these plans in the strongest possible terms.”\nBristol Central Green M.P Carla Denyer has also objected to the expansion plans.\nDespite the airport’s claims, Green councillors point out that expansion is unlikely to create many new jobs. There are no more jobs now at airports than there were 20 years ago. Analysis from the New Economics Foundation shows the boom in air travel since 2015 has failed to increase UK productivity or GDP growth, while business use of air travel – a key argument for expansion – has declined by 50% since 2013.[3]\nIn addition, only 13% of passengers are tourists coming to Bristol so any increase in Bristol Airport’s capacity is likely to mean more money going out of the local area rather than coming in.\nAs Bristol Airport is currently owned by the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Fund, any increased income from the airport would be likely to go to the fund rather than benefitting local people.\nThe Bristol Green Group is calling for the following:\nNotes for editors:\nReferences\nCllr Emma Edwards is the Leader of the Green Group on Bristol City Council\nMore about Emma",

She makes the allegation that data was possibly transferred between two of Arron Bank’s companies – GoSkippy and Eldon Insurance – and Leave.EU, the campaign that Mr Banks co-founded.\nCommenting, Molly said:\n“There is a growing body of evidence that points to abuses by the Leave campaign and these must be fully investigated. No one is above the law and that includes Arron Banks who co-founded Leave.EU and who owns these Bristol based companies.\n“I have written to Avon and Somerset Constabulary, not just to formally lodge the evidence given in Parliament today, but also to seek clarity about who between the police, the Information Commissioner’s Office and the Electoral Commission is investigating this.

  "https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_/https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_making-steps-towards-carbon-neutrality/content_290.html": "menu\nGreen councillors have welcomed the first steps at Bristol Council towards work for Bristol to go carbon neutral by 2030. Work began after a Council motion by Green Councillor Carla Denyer passed in November last year, and Greens are now working with other parties to identify policies with cross-party support, that can be pushed forward. Meanwhile the Council has commissioned a study to assess how much more the city needs to do to reach the 2030 target, and the Mayor is due to present a report back to Full Council in July.\nA Green amendment to the council budget, passed in February, enables some initial action towards the new target by levying fines on commercial landlords with energy-inefficient buildings. The funds raised will be used to develop the city’s carbon neutrality action plan and providing funding for small community energy generation and energy efficiency schemes, as well as funding local street improvements (paying for a crackdown on fly-tipping and street flooding).\nGreen councillors highlighted some actions that could help Bristol reach carbon neutrality in their ‘Change Starts Now’ report released in January. They say these are common sense, effective ideas drawn from experience elsewhere, which could be good for Bristol as well as good for the climate, improving quality of life as well as reducing carbon emissions. Some of the key ideas include: developing renewable energy sources in the region, building and refitting much more carbon-neutral housing, and changing transport policy to prioritise public transport, walking and cycling.\nGreen group leader councillor Eleanor Combley said:\n“The Mayor committed himself to the target of achieving Carbon Neutrality by 2030 when he voted for the Green Climate Emergency motion back in November, now there is an urgent need to turn those words into real action. Since we passed the motion over 70 authorities in the UK have followed Bristol’s example, including London. We know that 2030 is an ambitious target, but we have to be bold and not delay to have any chance of avoiding catastrophic climate breakdown.\n“Councillors of all parties supported the 2030 motion, and there is a strong mood of co-operation in the cross-party working group, so I am cautiously optimistic about the way things are going. However, I would say to all the campaigners – the protesters, the letter writers, the petitioners and the climate strikers – your work is not yet done. Reaching carbon neutrality by 2030 is going to take some big changes, and not all politicians will have the courage for that. We need you to keep the pressure on – and Greens will do the same from inside the council.”\nGreen candidate for Bristol Mayor, Sandy Hore-Ruthven, added:\n“We can see the difference Bristol’s Green Councillors make, in the way they have taken the lead on the climate emergency. With unanimous political support across parties we have the opportunity to take bold action that will put Bristol at the forefront of tackling climate change. Our children are demanding it and our city leaders must show they are willing to take action.”",

She will be discussing some of Bristol’s key transport issues as she teams up with local Greens on the election campaign trail.\nJenny, who advised former London mayor Ken Livingstone on transport and road safety, said:\n“It’s vital that big cities like Bristol have fully integrated, affordable and reliable public transport. How can we expect to get people out of their cars and walking, cycling or using public transport if the roads are dangerous and the public transport links are poor and cost a lot? It should also be simple to use: Bristol Greens want to introduce an integrated ticketing system like the Oyster card, which has made travelling in London for both residents and visitors so much easier.”\nRob Telford, Green Party candidate in Ashley and co-organiser of the recent campaign calling on FirstBus to ‘Make Fares Fair, said: “Bristol has so much public transport potential and its one of the Green Party’s priorities to improve the network. The Greens want to bring the buses back under public control, improve the local railway network, and build a public transport hub next to Temple Meads to increase accessibility to the network. We’d also continue to develop pedestrian areas and increase provision for cycle paths.”\nDaniella Radice, Green Party candidate in Bishopston, said: “With people having to travel further and further to find work it’s vital that Bristol has a public transport system that supports both them and their families. Public transport should be fully accessible to everyone and the Greens will work to ensure that travelling with a pushchair or a wheelchair becomes significantly easier. We support citywide 20mph limits to improve pedestrian and cyclist safety around our city.”\nAmong other campaigns, Green Party members supported the ‘Make Fares Fair’ and ‘Action for Rail’ campaigns as well as the ongoing FOSBR (Friends of Suburban Bristol Railways) campaign to improve the local rail network.",
  "https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_/https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_heads-lg-win-tails-the-council-loses/content_281.html": "menu\nGreen Councillors yesterday condemned proposals from the Mayor to hand key public land on Bristol’s Temple Island site to financial services company Legal & General (L&G), through an agreement created which avoids the usual legal tendering process. The Council’s arrangement would use public funds to develop the site and guarantee private profits but would give the Council no control over the development process or levels of affordable housing.\nSome of the issues raised by Green Councillors included:\nLeader of the Green Group, Councillor Eleanor Combley, said:\n“Let’s be clear about these plans: Bristol Council would be taking public money from the many to line the pockets of the few at Legal & General, and taking on much of the risk into the bargain.\n“The city has already invested millions of pounds in our land at Temple Island. Now the Mayor is proposing to spend even more to upgrade it, and then hand the whole lot over to a multi-billion pound financial services company. Then, as if this deal wasn’t sweet enough, the Council will pay L&G half a million to fund planning and design work for the land, and promise to cover the rent on office spaces for 40 years (even if tenants can’t be found). In short, the Council will shoulder the risk in order to provide the private company with a guaranteed profit. It’s heads L&G win, tails the Council loses.\n“As a result, you might hope we would secure strong controls over what is developed there, but in fact we have no guarantee even on levels of affordable housing – only ‘aspirations’ – and this from a company that has already taken Bristol Council to court in order to reduce its affordable housing on another site in the centre from 24 to just 4 flats.\n“It is deeply concerning that the Mayor has tried to duck scrutiny and the normal legal process so he can make this cosy arrangement with Legal and General. As my colleague Cllr O’Rourke has raised, it’s even possible that this unorthodox deal could open the Council up to legal action from other developers who were denied the opportunity to tender, as occurred with a similar arrangement in West Berkshire.\n“The Mayor has said that actions, not words, are what matters. So what value should we put on his words about ‘municipal socialism’, when his proposed action amounts to bountiful generosity to wealthy corporations, with Bristol council tax payers stumping up the initial costs, and taking on a risk running to over a hundred million over the next forty years?”\nCouncillor Paula O’Rourke questioned the legality of the proposals, raising similarities to a case in West Berkshire where the Council recently lost a legal case. She asked the for assurances over the legal risk to the Council and said “The people of Bristol might think that BCC is now too committed to the deal with L&G to objectively assess the risk”. The Mayor was not in attendance at the meeting however his deputy said that ‘independent legal advice’ had been taken.\nCllr O’Rourke’s full question is in the notes below.\nCouncillor Jerome Thomas submitted a statement against the proposal, comparing it to what the Mayor had promised after cancelling plans for the Bristol Arena.\nHe said:\n“The Mayor said that there was an unacceptable level of financial risk of going ahead with the Arena at Temple Island, and that “the free market was offering us a solution without public intervention”. It is now clear that the Mayor’s preferred ‘solution’ requires very significant public intervention. This intervention is required in the form of many tens of millions of pounds of guaranteed rent payments to the Council’s preferred developer, putting the Council at very significant financial risk.”\nCllr Thomas’ full question is below.\nNotes: Statement and questions from Cllrs O’Rourke and Thomas\nStatement: CS8.1 Cabinet – 2nd July 2019\nRe: Agenda item 8- Temple Island\nStatement submitted by: Cllr Jerome Thomas\nIn September 2018 Bristol’s councillors from all parties and without any opposition voted that the ‘best site for Bristol’s arena for the benefit of Bristol as a whole, is Temple Island in the centre of Bristol and that the decision maker by guided by the vote of this meeting.’\nAt the same time over 90% of the statements on the arena from Bristol’s residents were in favour of building the arena at Temple Island.\nThe day after that vote the Mayor took the decision to ignore the views of councillors and of Bristol residents and go ahead instead with an office led development at Temple Island. The Mayor said that there was an unacceptable level of financial risk of going ahead with the Arena at Temple Island, and that “the free market was offering us a solution without public intervention”. It is now clear that Mayor’s preferred ‘solution’ requires very significant public intervention. This intervention is required in the form of many tens of millions of pounds of guaranteed rent payments to the Council’s preferred developer, putting the Council at very significant financial risk.\nNot only is the Mayor proposing to underwrite a development that Bristol doesn’t want, but he is doing everything within his powers to avoid public procurement rules which would ensure that, whatever the final outcome, the city gets the best value for the proposed use of the land, through an open and legal procurement process.\nQuestion: CQ8.2 Cabinet – 2 July 2019\nRe: Agenda item 8: Temple Island – update on proposals and disposal arrangements\nQuestion submitted by: Cllr Paula O’Rourke\nThe report refers to the ‘Faraday case’ (Faraday Development Ltd v West Berkshire Council [2018] EWCA Civ 2532) where an authority was found to have entered into an ‘ineffective contract’ which was ‘ultimately unlawful’. This raises some concerns due to the similarity with that case and the proposal put forward to Cabinet.\nAllow me to outline the similarities:\nBCC proposes the disposal of Temple Island as a ‘property transaction’, which falls outside the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 (which would oblige BCC to enter into public procurement). By doing this, you empower yourselves to enter into a contract with L&G without any form of tendering. Ditto West Berkshire Council.\nHowever, you are drawing up proposals which will ‘trigger’ development works which would fall within the guidelines for public procurement. In the Faraday case, the Court of Appeal judgement says that ‘once the developer…had proceeded to draw down the land as per the terms of the agreement, there had been a procurement of development works that did not undergo the requisite procurement procedure’. This is what made the contract ‘ineffective’ and it was judged that West Berkshire Council had ‘acted unlawfully’.\nThe judge then went on to give the following advice to other councils:\n– Public bodies should consider whether an agreement may trigger the public procurement regimes at the beginning, or indeed at any stage of the agreement. It is important to note that the Court of Appeal found that although there had been no deliberate wrongdoing by the Council, the effect of circumventing the procurement regime was the same.\nQuestions:\n1. What assurance can you give that developers, who have not been allowed to tender for Temple Island, will not take BCC to court, using the Faraday case as precedent?\n2. I note that the Faraday case came to the Court of Appeal in December 2018. The sketch for the L&G development of Temple Island was public last summer, during the decision about the Arena and before this judgement. The people of Bristol might think that BCC is now too committed to the deal with L&G to objectively assess the risk; what assurance can you give that this is not true?",

The proposals would force member states to open up domestic passenger services to competitive tendering and could, say the Greens, impose the failed model of fragmentation and privatisation currently applied in the UK [1].\nThe proposals come at a time when public ownership of public services is increasingly popular with UK voters [2]. South West Greens also point to the strong support for their campaign and petition to take back the Great Western rail franchise into public ownership when the current contract expires in two years time [3]. In a recent appearance on the BBC Politics show, Dr Scott Cato also highlighted the failure of investment in the South West under the private ownership model, which has seen 100 times more being spent on transport investment in London than the South West. [4] Dr Molly Scott Cato said:\n“How ironic that at a time when the idea of taking back our railways into public ownership has never been more popular with the British public, the European Commission is seeking to impose a failed model of privatisation on domestic rail passenger services in EU member states. Greens in the European Parliament will fight hard against any moves to remove the freedom for countries to choose which way they want to run their passenger rail services. For Greens in the UK that means, unequivocally, public ownership of our railways.”\nThe Green Party is the only political Party fully committed to taking back the railways into public ownership, arguing it would save taxpayers more than £1 billion a year and lead to lower fares and better services.\nNotes\n[1] The EU’s Fourth Railway Package\nRMT perspective: http://www.rmt.org.uk/campaigns/rail/stop-eu-rail-privatisation/\nFull EU proposals: http://ec.europa.eu/transport/modes/rail/packages/2013_en.htm\n[2] In a recent YouGov poll 66% support nationalising the railway companies while 23% think they should be run privately. http://yougov.co.uk/news/2013/11/04/nationalise-energy-and-rail-companies-say-public/\n[3] South West Green Party are calling for the return of the Great Western rail franchise to public ownership when the current rail franchise operated by First Group comes up for renewal in 2015.

I am delighted therefore that, by a large majority, MEPs have backed a Green initiative challenging ‘planned obsolescence’ – the deliberate policy used by manufacturers to create consumer goods that rapidly become obsolete and so require replacing.\n“We can no longer ignore the environmental, social and health consequences of this damaging attitude. Such an approach leads to resource depletion, high transport emissions and of course mountains of waste. We need a much greater emphasis on reuse and repair and tax incentives to encourage this. We must particularly look at ways to tackle software obsolescence, which determines the lifetime of many consumer goods. Tackling our disposable culture can also have huge economic benefits by reducing costs for consumers and creating new jobs in the ‘circular economy’ [1].\n“MEPs have acknowledged we need to act; we now need the European Commission to take on board the calls of the Parliament and support a new, more sustainable approach to consumer products.”\nNotes\n[1]http://www.wrap.org.uk/about-us/about/wrap-and-circular-economy",

This is good news as new residents are keen for their flats (some have even sadly lost mortgage offers along the way). The public toilets need to be reinstated on the site; and then once its fit out is completed the relocation of the library is good news that many residents have been waiting years for.\nIt’s also positive that the opportunity is being taken to reopen negotiations with the Bishopston Medical Practice, as their current plans are only temporary and are going to affect local residents (as was clear in Development Control).\nCan the Mayor assure local residents, traders and councillors that:\n· After a decade of plans and development issues, steps are being taken to ensure that Bristol North Baths will be put back on track for completion. Can you assure us that ward Cllrs and local residents will be kept fully informed so that accurate information is made available in a timely manner and that the restoration of the shopper’s car park is in the early list of things to be completed, as local traders need to know this.\n· Some of the problems that have beleaguered this project are bad luck, but it is clear that over the decade long lifetime of the project, mistakes have been made by the Council. Can you confirm that, without delaying the development further, a full and publicly available review of the project once completed will be made so that similar mistakes are not made again?”",

The Party is dedicated to protecting our NHS and has decided not to stand in a number of constituencies and, instead, endorse the candidate most likely to support a national health service betrayed by almost a decade of Tory rule [2].\nThe Green Party is the only parliamentary political party to fully support the NHS Bill [3], which was backed in Parliament by Green co-leader Caroline Lucas MP [4] and aims to roll back decades of NHS privatisation and restore a truly public, fully-funded National Health Service.\nJeremy Corbyn is one of just a handful of Labour MPs who have supported the bill previously. Not one Bristol Labour Party candidate has pledged to back the Bill that would remove the profit motive from the NHS [5].\nBristol West is a two-horse race between the Greens and Labour. And Molly Scott Cato, whose son is a junior doctor, claims that voters in the constituency need to know whether the Labour Party is ‘with us or against us’ on the NHS.\nAhead of Corbyn’s visit, Molly said:\n“The Green Party is united in its support for the restoration of a fully-funded, truly public health service; we are a Party that never has and never will sell our NHS down the river of private profit. And while it was Labour that expanded the disastrous PFI scheme that has saddled so many of our hospitals with billions of pounds of debt, it is heartening to see that the Labour leader is backing the NHS Bill and a break from his party’s privatisation past.”\n“It is all a meaningless gesture if Jeremy Corbyn can’t persuade his own MPs to back the bill, though. Which is why I’m laying down the challenge to Labour candidates across Bristol; will you stand with your leader and back the NHS Bill?”\n“Our NHS is in desperate need; spending is at its lowest level since the 1950s [6] and, at the same time, hospitals have been asked to make £22bn worth of cuts [7] – cuts that researchers have concluded are responsible for 30,000 excess deaths a year [8].”\n“Around 15,000 beds have been slashed across the country, cutting capacity by more than 5 million patients every year [9]. In Bristol, there are plans, which were only revealed after pressure from healthcare campaigners, to scythe £139m from local healthcare services and enforce a further £104m of as yet unspecified cuts. We can’t stand by and let this happen [10].”\n“As the Green MP for Bristol West, I will fight to reverse this race to the bottom and give our NHS the emergency kiss of life it so desperately needs. I would be proud to stand alongside Jeremy Corbyn and Caroline Lucas to support the NHS Reinstatement Bill and bring us one step closer to reinstating a fully funded, truly public NHS.”",

Our libraries and the reference materials they provide are precious and must not be a victim of the cuts. We welcome the cross party support this issue has now gained, and hope the mayor will make the right decision for the future of our city and its history. Once you’ve lost a public resource of great worth you’ve lost it for good,” said Tess Green, councillor for Southville ward.\nIssues about the suitability of the library basement for school facilities are being raised in Green statements to the Cabinet. These concerns include the limited indoor light and outdoor access for children, and suitability of the Grade 1 listed building to be converted for school use.\nRob Telford, Green councillor for Ashley ward and member of the council’s Children & Young People’s scrutiny commission said,\n“There are serious concerns about the long-term effects of lack of natural light on children and their ability to learn. Additionally, there is not the space at the site for children to be able to access both indoor and outdoor play areas. Physical recreation is crucial for our children’s well-being and for the development of their social and team skills.”\n“It is also imperative that the 270,000 items of archive material stored in the Central Library are still able to be accessed by library users in a central and convenient location for research. Many library users will not yet have the skills or access to find materials online. There are also solid architectural and historical reasons why maintaining a store in the Central Library is the best use of the building.”\nGreen councillors also pointed out that the community consultation on the disposal of this public asset has been almost non existent. They further highlighted the issue that the lease rate being proposed is far below market average.\n“Giving away our library archive at this low rate, and the poor contractual arrangements proposed, are a travesty. The Cathedral School must look elsewhere for more appropriate solutions,” added Daniella Radice, Green group leader on Bristol City Council.\nStatements of opposition to the proposal from Green Party members have been submitted to cabinet.\nNotes\n1.

The General Court dismissed this action so Greenpeace Energy has now lodged an appeal with the ECJ.\nMolly has also made her own challenge. In March this year she wrote to the Commission asking it to investigate whether a proposed rescue plan for Hinkley C was in breach of European state aid rules. She said:\n“Any efforts to try and block this economically illiterate and technically flawed project deserves support. The subsidies being offered to the Hinkley project will distort competition on the electricity market in Europe and have a chilling effect on investment in renewables.”\n“Yet this is just the time when we need an innovative renewable energy revolution, not to resort to the failed technologies of the past. With the climate crisis wiping out a large chunk of the Great Barrier reef; unprecedented sea ice melt occurring this year, and the Paris Agreement committing nations to keep the rise in global temperature to less than 2 degrees, we need an emergency Plan B for energy. A plan based on a wide range of renewable energy technologies, energy efficiency and innovative smart grid and energy storage solutions.\n“With strong political will – rather than the ideological opposition to renewables we have seen from the Conservatives – these are solutions that can be implemented in the speedy time frame required for tackling climate change and meeting our commitments under the Paris Agreement. Hinkley won’t deliver a single watt of electricity until at least 2025.\n“If legal action is the only way to make our government and the Commission see sense on the disaster that is Hinkley, then we must support it. And it is no good the government trying to hide behind the veil of Brexit; as long as the UK is a member of the EU, it is bound by European law.”",

Sometimes people feel there is no point in responding, as they think they will not be listened to anyway, but as your local Green councillors we will be working hard to make sure your voice is heard.”\n“The context since these cuts were first proposed has changed, and we are now in a much stronger position to oppose the Tory austerity budget that underlies them. There are hints from Number 10 that Theresa May could be retreating from austerity, and we want to see Labour pushing the Tories on this issue, not continuing to implement Tory cuts as they have done in Bristol over the last year. Bristol sent out a clear message last week that they are not content to sit by and have services slashed around them. They put their faith in Labour to stand up against austerity.”\n“As Bristol now has a Labour mayor, a Labour majority on the council and 4 Labour MPs representing it, surely there is no excuse for Labour not to do what they were elected for – they should use the momentum they have now to work across the core cities (the 10 largest cities outside of London) and push the government to accept that the cuts to local government funding are completely unachievable, and will have a devastating effect. We will be more than happy to support the administration if they do.”\n“As Greens we are passionate about quality of life, and the areas being cut here – support for adults with disabilities, school crossing patrols, libraries, public toilets, and local democracy through the neighbourhood partnerships – all have a big impact on people’s quality of life. There is much talk of enabling community leadership, but we believe that cutting local services and simply expecting over-burdened charities and volunteers to pick up the slack is neither feasible nor fair.”\n“We will continue to oppose Tory austerity and to hold Labour to account and would urge the citizens of Bristol to speak up for the services they value.”",

At the same time it would allow Bristol to move a significant step closer to the goal of sending zero waste to landfill and creating sustainable jobs.”\nThe Green Party refer to evidence that placing greater emphasis on repair and reuse offers the opportunity to reduce waste whilst retaining greater value from existing products and materials.(2)\nAt present just 0.1% of Bristol’s domestic waste is reused, despite estimates that, for example, 40% of discarded large kitchen appliances are still in working order and current reuse of T-shirts and sofas nationally save the UK over 500,000 tonnes of carbon emissions per year. (3)\nIf Bristol were to set and meet a target of recovering 10% of its domestic waste for reuse and remanufacture by working with the many waste recovery organisations in the city, there is the potential to create up to 300 permanent jobs whilst saving consumers well over £1.5m in costs.\nIn addition, increasing the level of recycling to 70% to eliminate domestic waste sent to landfill offers the opportunity to create up to 400 additional jobs creating an overall total of up to 700 new sustainable jobs for the city\nCouncillor Carla Denyer (Clifton East) said\n“The tide of waste that we see go to landfill in our city increasingly includes repairable high value items, like laptops or washing machines. With sufficient partnership working with skilled repair and recycling professionals, we could stop this trend, repair much of our waste, and see jobs and goods created from our efforts. It’s a no-brainer.”\nShe continued\n“Sending 0% of our waste to landfill is achievable by 2020 if Bristol as a city commits to ideals such as reusing (rather than replacing), swapping and sharing, second hand markets, being willing to visit repair centres and more. This, alongside investment in clean waste to energy technology to dispose sustainably of the limited landfill waste that we will create, would make zero landfill a reality. This ambition is what should be expected of a European Green Capital.”\nEarlier in July, the Green Party launched a call for the city to send zero waste to landfill by 2020 (4). Calls for greater repair and reuse facilities in the city, as exemplified in many other European cities, are central to the achievement of this goal.\nCouncillor Martin Fodor (Redland) said “Waste needs to be seen as a highly valued resource whose proper utilisation can improve both our environmental and socio-economic performance. We would like to see the Bristol Waste Company play a full part in innovations and experiments that encourage reuse and repair working in partnership with other Bristol organisations and groups, and drawing on other services the council runs. I have been pressing for this as lead Green councillor on the scrutiny of this service, with the full support of our Assistant Mayor, Daniella Radice.”\nNotes:\n1.

We know that for most children in care it is better to be closer to home, near their family and communities and where they can be supported by local social workers. In Bristol 1 in 10 children in care are placed more than 20 miles from their home.”\n“Sending children far from home is not only often more disruptive for looked after children, but also more expensive for the Council, costing around £40k more a year. The Mayor’s budget proposes putting this money into the Council’s reserves. Instead, I would like to see it invested to set up two small, specialist children’s homes here in Bristol. Using some of the money the Council puts aside for a rainy day now will reduce the amount the Council spends in the longer term while improving our children’s services at the same time.”\nCouncillor Combley will put her amendment to the Budget meeting on the 20th February, where it will be voted on by all Councillors. It is one of a number of Green amendments that look for creative ways to find additional money as funding cuts put yet more pressure on front line services.\n“Across the country Councils are facing further cuts and frontline children’s services are being pushed to breaking point. According to the Local Government Association a child was referred to local authority services every 49 seconds last year and children’s care will be facing a £2billion funding gap by 2020. We desperately need more funding from Government to support children in care, but our children can’t afford to wait for this Government to come to its senses, which is why I am proposing we should take this action now.”\nNotes\nThe full text for Councillor Combley’s amendment can be found on p454 of the Council’s budget papers: https://democracy.bristol.gov.uk/documents/g2705/Public%20reports%20pack%2020th-Feb-2018%2014.00%20Full%20Council.pdf?T=10\nThe LGA reported earlier this year the extent of the crisis in children’s services: https://www.local.gov.uk/about/news/child-referred-childrens-services-every-49-seconds-councils-warn\nThe funding crisis to children’s services was also covered in the Bristol Post: https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/child-protection-at-breaking-point-310173",

Meanwhile, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which produces independent forecasts for the government, estimates that as a consequence of leaving the EU, overall borrowing will grow by almost £60 billion over the five years 2016-17 to 2020-21. This estimate is based on predictions of less tax paid by fewer migrants, losses due to a smaller economy and increased government expenditure, mainly due to higher inflation and higher interest rates. Molly said:\n“David Davis is deliberately provoking confrontation over the divorce bill when he must know that the cost of leaving the EU is equal to or less than the cost of the cliff edge outcome he and his Brexit cabal are leading us towards.\n“Rather than using Brexit as an opportunity to demonstrate how tough he is, Davis should focus on what actions his government need to take to avoid a cliff edge scenario. For Greens that means remaining in the single market and customs union and offering the people a chance to decide, through a ratification referendum, whether they like the deal on offer at the end the negotiation period or would prefer to avoid the cliff altogether by remaining in the EU.”\nMolly also warns that money saved on our regular net contribution to the EU – about £136 million per week – is far less than the OBR estimate for lost tax revenue and extra expenditure arising from Brexit. She said:\n“The €60bn needed to cover the costs of Brexit is substantially more than the £35bn over five years that our net contribution of £136m per week to the EU amounts to. The totally misleading and notorious £350 million per week figure, promised by Leave campaigners for the NHS, was a lie then and is a lie with bells on now, as leaving the EU will prove more costly than being a member.”",

In particular, Better for the Country Ltd (BFTC), a company that is registered in Bristol, stands accused of funding so-called ‘twitter bots’ – computer algorithms that send out automated posts, in a process that contravenes normal democratic standards and may be illegal.\nThe letter comes as the Electoral Commission announces it is to investigate whether ex-UKIP donor and local resident, Arron Banks, broke donation rules during the EU referendum campaign [2]. Molly Scott Cato said:\n“There have been a growing number of worrying reports about alleged illegal spending in the lead up to the 2016 EU referendum, and it seems Bristol is central to many of these claims. BFTC is registered in Bristol and Mr Banks, who lives in the Bristol region, is one of its directors.

  "https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_/https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_council-support-social-care/content_807.html": "menu\nTuesday 16th February 2016\nCouncil has today voted to support a Green Party amendment that raises £3.5 million to support care homes, disabled services and home care services to help plug the worsening gap in adult social care services. The money will be raised by increasing council tax by an additional 2%, the equivalent of an extra 41p a week for the average household1 in Bristol.\nLeader of the Green councillors, Ani Stafford-Townsend said:\n“This money will help to prevent the worst cuts to those in most need of care. Whether you have a parent or grandparent who uses care home facilities, a neighbour who uses disability services or a friend who needs support struggling with depression or addiction, most of us know someone who has used adult social care services at some stage.”\n“No one wants to put up council tax when people across the city struggle to pay their bills, but it is also unacceptable for older people and people with disabilities to be abandoned in their homes without care. To help those on the lowest income pay their council tax, Greens are campaigning for the Council Tax Reduction Scheme to be protected beyond next year.”\n“The adult social care levy is the only way that local councils have of preventing the worst of adult social care cuts imposed by the Tory government. Many cities introduced it as a matter of course – but not Bristol. It seems no coincidence that in an election year the Mayor and the other parties have shied away from proposing this desperately needed council tax rise.”\n“As Greens we feel that some things are just too important to play political games with. We are delighted that Labour and the Lib Dems have now joined with the Greens in voting to prevent the worst cuts to adult social care services. We hope they will continue to join with us and lobby central government to halt the ideological cuts that are seeing the destruction of our local services.”\nThe social care precept will see a weekly increase of 41p for band B households, the most common banding in Bristol.\nAdult social care precept – the government spending review announced that upper tier councils would be able to collect a 2% precept to help fund adult social care, which is facing budget pressure in councils across the country. This gives councils the power to raise additional funds by increasing council tax by up to 2% in addition to any normal council tax rises. If adopted in Bristol, this additional 2% precept would raise £3.5m to be spent on adult social care over 2016/17. At present, the Mayor’s budget proposals have not taken up the government’s 2% precept offer. Current projections predict that the council will be £6.3m over budget for social care over 2015/16.

On the day that the Mayor takes his budget to Full Council, which includes £101 million of cuts to the Council’s finances, Greens have pointed out that in areas as diverse as children’s centres, libraries and police Marvin is implementing cuts when he promised real investment.\nA few examples of Marvin’s manifesto pledges, compared to his budget include:\nOn Children’s Centres: Marvin promised to: “Protect Children’s Centres, bringing together early years’ health and education to tackle child poverty and help children and families build resilience for life.” In fact the proposed budget includes cuts of £750k to Children’s Centres.\nOn Libraries: Marvin promised to: “Ensure Bristol has library facilities fit for the 21st century” and many of Labour’s councillors campaigned against any local library closures. The budget however includes a cut of £300k.\nOn crime and safety: Marvin promised to: “Focus on cutting crime through building a strong partnership between the Council, communities and the police.” The budget however proposes to cut PCSO’s by £181k.\nCommenting on these striking differences, Cllr Charlie Bolton, said,\n“Marvin made many promises during his campaign and it was on this basis that the people of Bristol elected him. He needs to come clean now and justify to the people of Bristol why he feels he needs to make these cuts. When we are trying to promote more young children walking to schools, why is funding for lollipop people being removed? When we are trying to strengthen our local democracy, why is funding from voter registration schemes being scrapped? When we are trying to empower communities, why is funding from our neighbourhood partnerships being slashed?\nThese are serious questions that Marvin must answer. I for one am deeply disappointed that so few of his election pledges are being kept.”\nHe continued, “As Greens we will continue to do what we promised. We will continue to work positively and progressively with other local political parties to fight back against the cuts and then to mitigate the impact of them the best we can. We will also, however, keep our promise of holding Marvin to account.”\nNotes\nCouncillor Charlie Bolton’s speech to the budget meeting can be found here>>\nThe relevant section of the proposed budget quoted above are:\nChildren’s Centres – Children’s centres provide valuable services including much of our early intervention work with young families. They also support public health to deliver their programmes. This proposal keeps our commitment to those services and the value they bring, and recommends a change to the way that we organise our offer, as part of a (0–19) multiagency early help family support model. We will review management structures and combine some services to create efficiencies. We hope to keep 18 children’s centres open and find alternative ways to provide some of the existing services. (£750k)\nLibrary Services – This would focus our investment and efforts on a smaller but high quality library service in Bristol. This would include retaining the Central Library and a redesign of the service within the lower cash limit. (£300)\nPolice – There are 130 PCSOs in Bristol, funded by the police, the council and the Police and Crime Commissioner. We need to consider the level of funding the council continues to put into the service which may see a reduction in Police Community Support Officer posts. We will continue to support but at a reduced level. This proposed reduction is the same as we consulted on in October, but a proportion of the savings are attributed to other funding streams.

We know that for most children in care it is better to be closer to home, near their family and communities and where they can be supported by local social workers. In Bristol 1 in 10 children in care are placed more than 20 miles from their home.”\n“Sending children far from home is not only often more disruptive for looked after children, but also more expensive for the Council, costing around £40k more a year. The Mayor’s budget proposes putting this money into the Council’s reserves. Instead, I would like to see it invested to set up two small, specialist children’s homes here in Bristol. Using some of the money the Council puts aside for a rainy day now will reduce the amount the Council spends in the longer term while improving our children’s services at the same time.”\nCouncillor Combley will put her amendment to the Budget meeting on the 20th February, where it will be voted on by all Councillors. It is one of a number of Green amendments that look for creative ways to find additional money as funding cuts put yet more pressure on front line services.\n“Across the country Councils are facing further cuts and frontline children’s services are being pushed to breaking point. According to the Local Government Association a child was referred to local authority services every 49 seconds last year and children’s care will be facing a £2billion funding gap by 2020. We desperately need more funding from Government to support children in care, but our children can’t afford to wait for this Government to come to its senses, which is why I am proposing we should take this action now.”\nNotes\nThe full text for Councillor Combley’s amendment can be found on p454 of the Council’s budget papers: https://democracy.bristol.gov.uk/documents/g2705/Public%20reports%20pack%2020th-Feb-2018%2014.00%20Full%20Council.pdf?T=10\nThe LGA reported earlier this year the extent of the crisis in children’s services: https://www.local.gov.uk/about/news/child-referred-childrens-services-every-49-seconds-councils-warn\nThe funding crisis to children’s services was also covered in the Bristol Post: https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/child-protection-at-breaking-point-310173",
  "https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_/https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_brexit-update-from-bristols-green-mep2/content_417.html": "menu\nA Brexit update from Bristol’s Green MEP Molly Scott Cato – sign up to receive regular updates here\nThis comes to you at a time when the stakes couldn’t be higher. Boris Johnson has warned that Brexit negotiations are facing meltdown, but urges us, in typical Dad’s Army fashion, not to panic. He also suggests he would prefer Donald Trump to be our negotiator in chief, despite the “breakdowns and all sorts of chaos” that would follow. He also accused the critical Irish border question of being the “tail to wag the dog” and that Brexit was being “dictated by this folly”.\nThis has demonstrated more clearly than ever before the utter contempt leading Brextremist Tories have for the people of this country; for democracy and for harmonious relationships with our closest neighbours.\nMeanwhile, Labour seem content to hand Brextremists like Boris Johnson hard Brexit on a plate. They are refusing to back a cross-Party Lords’ amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill calling on the UK to join the European Economic Area (EEA) – effectively meaning we would remain in the single market. Keir Starmer, Labour’s Shadow Secretary of State for Brexit, announced earlier this week that the Party would propose its own amendment calling for “full access to the internal market of the European Union”. This is cakeism at its worst, as I point out in my open letter to Mr Starmer. The EU and EU27 have repeatedly made clear they are not willing to allow cherry picking or bespoke deals for the UK. It is disingenuous and arrogant in the extreme to think Labour would be able to negotiate such a deal that undermines the four freedoms – all of which are integral to the single market.\nWhich brings me to the most important purpose of this email. Next Tuesday 12th and Wednesday 13th June, MPs will debate and vote on 15 Lords amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill. As a further example of the government’s contempt for democratic debate they have allowed just 12 hours in total for MPs to make some of the most important decisions of their political lives.\nIt is therefore crucial that MPs hear the voices of their constituents before the debate and vote next week. I have drafted a letter to help with lobbying your MP on three of the most important of the 15 amendments: continued membership of the customs union, giving Parliament a meaningful vote on the outcome of EU negotiations and removing the fixed exit date from the Bill. This is aimed at South West MPs but can be adapted for use anywhere.\nPlease do write to your MP this weekend using this link and urge him/her to act and vote courageously in the best interests of the country.\nOther Brexit News\nPeople’s Vote\nThe Brexit shambles that we are witnessing, and failure by both government and opposition to put the interests of the country first, makes it ever more important that control is handed back to the people. This is why I am calling for a People’s Vote, something I argued for in my Guardian letter this week. I urge you to join me in London on 23rd June at the People’s Vote march. Please share this with friends. We need a show of strength to demonstrate to the government that we must have a final say on the Brexit deal, or choose to remain in the EU.\nDoomsday No-deal scenario\nAs revelations emerged about civil servants preparing for food and medicine shortages if we crash out of the EU without a deal I was able to meet briefly with the Information Commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, when she appeared before a European Parliament hearing last week. For many months I have been using Freedom of Information requests to make public the government’s Brexit impact studies. In March the High Court refused permission for judicial review, that I applied for together with Jolyon Maugham QC. Now the Information Commission has agreed to meet me to discuss all this and their on-going investigations into the fraudulent activities of the Leave campaign.\nBrexit’s lost billions\nAt least a billion pounds of tax revenue, which could go towards funding schools and hospitals, will be lost due to Brexit. New revelations show that because Brexit is consuming all its time and resources, HMRC have shelved plans to digitalise tax procedures, which it estimates would have increased tax contributions to the exchequer by more than £1 billion. Our public services have already suffered badly due to the Tories cruel austerity measures. Now they look set to take a further hit thanks to Brexit. More on this here.\nMolly Scott Cato",
  "https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_/https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_tory-proposals-to-reduce-bus-lanes-are-absurd-say-green-councillors/content_834.html": "menu\nGreen Councillors have slammed proposals made by Conservative councillors to reduce Bristol’s bus lanes. Tory councillors have put forward a motion to Full Council which will be debated on Tuesday 19th January, to ask for money to be spent reviewing whether cars should be allowed to use bus lanes in off peak hours.\nCouncillor Deb Joffe, who will speak against the motion on Tuesday said:\n“The Tory’s attempt to reduce bus lanes ignores scientific evidence and economic principles [1]. In addition, this favours people who can afford to run cars at the expense of those who have no choice but to take buses. It is absurd and unjust, and I strongly hope that the Labour councillors oppose it along with the Greens.”\n“The implication is that increasing road capacity for cars will make travelling around the city easier. This is wrong on several counts. It completely ignores the basic facts of traffic flow, bus network management and economic principles. Reducing bus lanes would actually make the overall problems of traffic in the city worse as well as negatively impacting on those mobility problems.”\nCouncillor Charlie Bolton, who chairs the Place Scrutiny Commission added:\n“Increased road capacity for private cars ultimately leads to more traffic congestion and more air pollution, the very things the Tories are purporting to reduce [2]. More traffic also increases carbon emissions which, at the recent global climate change negotiations, even the Conservatives finally agreed need to be drastically reduced.”\n“We need more buses, not fewer to encourage people to get out of their cars. Opening bus lanes to cars makes bus reliability more challenging, and late buses in turn attract more people into using cars. This reduces demand for buses and makes them less viable for operators. It is a downward spiral.”\n“We have just seen bus usage rates start to rise significantly in Bristol, and it would be ridiculous to start reversing this process. Our priority must be to continue to improve bus services to make buses an attractive, convenient way to get around Bristol.’”\nNotes\n(1)Figures from the Department of Transport show that almost all households with above average income own a car but half of low income households do not. In addition 40% of women do not have independent access to a car compared to 25% of men:\n(2)The principle, which at first seems counter-intuitive, has been repeatedly demonstrated over many years now (e.g the government –commissioned Eddington Transport Study, 2006). Building a by-pass or an extra lane on the motorway initially eases traffic flow, but this ease of travel then encourages more people to drive and the congestion increases once more, but this time with more actual car traffic on the road. The same is true of allowing cars onto bus lanes in off-peak hours. If it becomes easier to drive your car at these times, then more people will do it and the end result is just as much congestion and a higher absolute number of cars on the road. The reverse is also true – reducing road capacity leads to people finding more sustainable ways of getting around, a phenomenon called ‘disappearing traffic’ (http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/117869/)",

It says the cuts are, ‘justified by the use of rhetoric and stigma which causes further prejudice and harm.’\nWith local government and benefits bearing more than 50% of all cuts, Green Party campaigners have been demonstrating in Bristol, Bath and Exeter, amongst other places, as councils agree budgets that will see massive cuts to funding of services supporting some of the poorest and most vulnerable in society. Anti cuts demonstrators have highlighted damaging cuts to children’s centres in Bath and North East Somerset and to Youth Services in Devon. Cllr Daniella Radice, leader of the Green group in Bristol said:\n“Austerity economics is hurting the poorest in Bristol. Vulnerable people will be hurt by these unnecessary cuts, imposed on Bristol by the Coalition government. But what we are seeing is only the beginning. Both George Osborne and Ed Balls have committed to continue local cut backs and reduce central government funding to Councils.”\nThe Green Party wants to see a radical change to the way local government is financed. With approximately 80% of local government finance coming from central government, Greens argue for power to be decentralised so more finance is under local control, as is the case in almost every other European country. Dr Molly Scott Cato, Green Party finance speaker and lead South West European candidate, said:\n“Austerity is political. It makes no moral or economic sense. The Green Party would end this cruelty by establishing measures such as a national living wage, implementing a citizen’s income, introducing a land value tax and encouraging more local currencies such as the Bristol pound and Totnes pound. By revising tax banding to make sure that those who can pay pay more, and those who can’t pay pay less [2], and by introducing measures such as a Robin Hood Tax [3], we could bring an end to austerity and enable local government to fund services for the common good, ensuring a decent quality of life for everyone.”\nCounting the Cuts is released ahead of a key debate in the House of Commons next week forced on the Government by the WOW Petition, signed by over 100,000 people and strongly supported by the Green Party. The petition calls on the Government to calculate the cumulative impact of its policies on disabled people.\nCaroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, said:\n“The Coalition’s utterly heartless austerity agenda is hitting the most vulnerable the hardest. The welfare state is under sustained attack and local services are being starved of vital funding. So much for those with the broadest shoulders bearing the greatest load. If the Government doesn’t really believe its policies are targeting the most vulnerable, it should be willing to carry out an impact assessment.”\nNotes\n[1] Press release from Centre for Welfare Reform: http://bit.ly/1h9s22Z\nCounting the Cuts full report: http://bit.ly/counting-cuts\n[2] Further details on Green Party tax and Citizens’ Income policies: http://policy.greenparty.org.uk/ec#Direct\n[3] For further details about the Green Party support for a Robin Hood Tax (Financial Transaction Tax) and campaign to encourage Councils to pass a motion of support for such a tax see ‘Set Robin Hood in motion say South West Greens!’ http://bit.ly/1dHjkey",

  "https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_/https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_trace_coronavirus/content_237.html": "menu\nBristol’s Green Party councillors have called for a new local emergency workforce to “contact trace” new cases of coronavirus to be ready for when the country emerges from lockdown. They call for a local system of testing, contact tracing and quarantine which would enable us to take control of the deadly coronavirus, save lives and avoid further lockdown. The call follows a Green report (1) on the issue published earlier in the month and increasing calls from public health officials for Government to rethink its centralized approach which puts too much focus on a tracing app without the wider system of support needed. (2)\nGreen Councillors have called on the Council’s Health Scrutiny Committee to look into the issue as a matter of urgency, as well as contacting health professionals and politicians from across the political spectrum, proposing joint work to enable Bristol to be the first local authority to pilot the approach.\nLeader of the Green Councillors, Eleanor Combley said:\n“The Government has been on the back foot throughout this emergency, failing to understand the importance of testing and contact tracing to contain the virus. We cannot let more people die because the Government does not have a strategy to get us out of lockdown safely.”\n“Bristol and the South West have so far avoided being as badly hit as some parts of the country, but this could change quickly when lockdown is lifted. It also means that Bristol is the ideal place to pilot the “community shield” approach to continue to protect our communities and the most vulnerable. We would be keen to pilot the approach in the parts of the city where people are most at risk, such as inner city neighbourhoods or areas with many people who have underlying health conditions.”\n“We have an excellent network of public health officials, environmental health experts and GPs across Bristol. Sexual health teams, health visitors and school nurses also have essential skills needed. We need to use the skills of those in our city, alongside many of the specialist volunteers who have come forward, to build an emergency workforce to keep our communities safe. If anywhere can do this, it’s Bristol.”\nLast week the Government announced it would recruit 18,000 people across the UK to carry out testing for the virus (3). But Greens have pointed out that the Government’s “5 steps” for easing lockdown ignore the World Health Organisation’s recommendation to “trace every contact” that individuals with the illness have had with other people (4). Also missing, is the vital support that those who are self-isolating need.\nThe method of testing, tracing and quarantining has been shown to be successful in countries such as Germany and South Korea.[5) Currently, the UK Government says that an app is being developed to track the spread of the virus – but this cannot solve the problem alone. There are also concerns about the data confidentiality credentials of some of the companies that the Government is considering using to provide an app.\nCouncillor Combley continued saying:\n“What we are proposing is a significant task but is also very simple – make sure that everyone who has symptoms of coronavirus and everyone they could have passed it onto is contacted and told to stay at home, with appropriate support. We know this is essential to prevent further outbreaks and save lives when ending the lockdown and will only work if it uses local knowledge and expertise.”\nImage: Photo by Alex Motoc on Unsplash\nNotes\n5. https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/04/world/europe/germany-coronavirus-death-rate.html",

He said:\n“Bristol’s Local Plan needs to be based on evidence, not the whims of Conservative politicians. An unreachable housing target that does not accurately reflect Bristol’s need will put at risk many of the positive and forward thinking policies that Bristol wishes to adopt. This includes setting goals that will enable us to tackle the climate and ecological emergencies and the needs of those on our housing waiting list.”\nGreens and councillors from other parties fear that the government’s current high housing target for Bristol may not be achievable, which could allow developers to appeal for their proposals to be judged by looser national planning policies rather than rules set locally in the Local Plan (see notes below).\nThis could mean much lower development standards on issues like sustainability, quality, green space and amounts of affordable housing. The current housing target stems from a government decision in December 2020 to add a 35% uplift on to the housing targets of the 20 largest cities.\nThe motion proposed by Councillor Dyer is designed to support the Council’s attempt to resolve this by commissioning an evidence-based study to examine how much housing is required in a city of Bristol’s size, in order to approach government with a more appropriate target.\nExplaining the motion, Tony said:\n“We’re calling for an approach to housing numbers in Bristol that is evidence based and reflects the levels of need and what the city can realistically deliver, rather than a number based on the whim of Tory MPs in Westminster. It is not an anti-development motion – it clearly recognises the need for housing, and calls for the council to support proposals to deliver 1,000 affordable homes per year. But the present government target of 67,000 homes – over 3,300 per year – is well beyond what Bristol has been able to deliver over a similar time scale at any point in the last half century or so, possibly even before then – it is simply unachievable in a city with a very limited supply of land to build on.”\nHe added:\n“This is a practical motion aimed at supporting a realistic and pragmatic approach to planning and housing in Bristol. It endorses the Council’s approach of commissioning an evidence based study to examine how much housing is required in a city of Bristol’s size, with a view to approaching government with an appropriate target. Setting an evidence based housing target for the city will allow us to better protect green spaces and ensure local planning policy has the necessary force to ensure more sustainable, affordable, and higher quality developments in Bristol, reflecting the voices of elected representatives and residents of the city itself.”\nThe Green party motion is a ‘golden motion’, meaning it is guaranteed to be discussed and voted on, and Councillor Dyer is hopeful of having cross party support for it. He said:\n“This motion is ultimately about the future of the city, and who gets to decide what that future will look like – Bristol’s residents and their locally elected representatives, or Westminster politicians and private developers.”\nNotes:\nYou can read the Green party motion here.\nBristol’s Local Plan sets boundaries for where development will be encouraged and where it will be discouraged. It also sets delivery targets for the number of houses local authorities are required to deliver, based on a central government target. (This includes purpose built student accommodation or PBSA). It will set a range of planning policies including regulating carbon emissions and adaptation to climate change, tree protection, and policies to support high streets, pubs and markets and design inclusive places. It will also look to safeguard key green spaces that have been the subject of development speculation. The next Local Plan is currently being drafted for early 2024, developed by officers and a cross-party working group of councillors.\nThe decision by the Metro Mayor in May 2022 to halt work on the West of England region’s Spatial Development Strategy has placed even more pressure on Bristol’s Local Plan. The upcoming Local Plan – planned to be adopted in Spring 2024 – will be the most important influence on how the city will develop up to 2040.\nBut local planning policies could be undermined or overturned by developers at planning appeals, if the housing numbers set by the government are too high and fail to reflect realities on the ground, or the land available in Bristol to deliver them. If a local authority is unable to demonstrate an adequate supply of land to deliver its targets, this weakens its Local Plan, and where local plan policies deviate significantly from national planning policy, a developer may appeal for the less vigorous national policy to be applied instead of the local policy. In practice, this can undermine the entire idea of a “local plan” and the decision making of local councillors elected by Bristolians to represent them – and it means that developments could be approved with weak climate standards or with little or no affordable housing.\nThe process currently used for setting housing targets involves an algorithm based on estimates for population change and household growth, but many of these estimates are outdated, and the target was recently adjusted for political reasons by the Conservative government, adding a whopping 35% uplift to the targets of major cities.\nThis means at present, the housing target set for Bristol under the top down method used by central government is 67,000 homes, or 3,370 homes per year over a 20 year period. The most homes built in a single year in Bristol in the last two decades was 2,672 in 2008/9.

  "https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_/https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_council-heading-in-wrong-direction-on-climate-emergency/content_208.html": "menu\nOver a year after Bristol Council’s declaration of a Climate Emergency, Green councillors say the Labour administration are making a series of bad decisions that will only make the emergency worse.\nIn November 2018 Bristol Council declared a Climate Emergency following a Green motion passing at Full Council. It was the first declaration of its kind in the UK, and was followed by similar declarations at over 400 councils around the country. However more than a year later Greens issue a warning about a lack of urgent action from the Labour Mayor, as well as major decisions that go in the opposite direction to the action that is needed. They pointed to the administration being on the ‘wrong side’ of recent airport expansion and divestment campaigns and cited recent developments at the Council as proof that the administration is taking little real action and pursuing a business as usual approach with regards to the climate.\nCarla Denyer, the Green Councillor that proposed the Emergency declaration, said:\n“Since I proposed the climate emergency I’ve said more times than I can remember that it cannot just be words. Declaring an emergency has to lead to real action.\n“So what has happened in Bristol? Well – the Mayor has set up boards and recently released a ‘One City’ strategy which looked at the targets the city will likely need to meet to become carbon neutral – although the strategy contained no concrete actions from the Council. And the Council is hoping to receive funding for Green projects through the much discussed ‘City Leap’ project – although there have been no solid details released on this so far.\n“All of this is good stuff – but having declared a Climate Emergency the Mayor has a duty to lead on it, rather than just saying ‘it’s up to everyone’. There are major areas that will need to be transformed in the city, areas mentioned in the One City strategy like transport, housing and insulation – yet there’s been very little in the way of new action or commitments from the administration on these fronts. In fact, in several key areas where the Council has a great deal of influence, the administration has outright resisted calls on them to take action, including divesting pensions from fossil fuels, opposing Bristol Airport expansion, and scrapping new road building plans. These would all have had a major climate benefit and cost the council nothing at all, yet the administration refused to even consider them.”\nShe added,\n“The overwhelming sense is that the Mayor sees the Climate Emergency as a nice thing to mention in speeches, but not something that requires real and urgent action, or any change in the way the Council does things.”\nGreens argue that the administration’s attitude to the climate is illustrated in the Mayor publically expressing support for Climate Striker Greta Thunberg during her visit, only for the Council to take multiple decisions the following week which will have a negative climate impact and increase carbon emissions across Bristol and the wider region.\nCouncillor Eleanor Combley, leader of the Green Group, said:\n“Last week we saw the One City Climate Strategy launched with great fanfare, and Greta Thunberg’s visit to support local School Strike for Climate activists being claimed by Labour as some kind of triumph for the Mayor.\n“This week we saw the reality behind those words. On Tuesday the Cabinet approved a regional transport plan which funds road building and road widening – increasing traffic congestion and carbon emissions – but secures no money for walking, cycling or public transport. The following day the Mayor’s preferred option of an out-of-town arena, with car-dependence built in, was approved at a planning meeting with the support of all Labour members of the committee. Finally on Thursday, despite rising calls to pull pension funds out of fossil fuels, including from the Council’s largest union, the Labour representative on Avon Pension Fund confirmed he is continuing with the discredited policy of ‘constructive engagement’, which has failed to significantly change the behaviour of fossil fuel companies for decades.”\nFurther information:\n– Greta Thunberg’s visit to Bristol last week was a media sensation that drew huge crowds of between 15 and 30 thousand people to see her speak on College Green outside City Hall. Marvin Rees tweeted his support for Thunberg stating “We’re a city at the forefront of action on climate & social justice” and shared a blog post by one of his cabinet members backing the demo. The Swedish teenager has made a point of criticising politicians for “empty words” on climate change and did not meet with politicians from any party during her visit.\n– On Tuesday the following week Bristol’s cabinet meeting passed the regional Joint Local Transport Plan, which was criticised by environmentalists, Greens and transport experts for prioritising road building and widening projects over public transport or walking and cycling. The plan may be illegal following the High Court’s rejection of the third runway at Heathrow on the grounds that it doesn’t meet the UK’s climate commitments. Labour’s former transport lead Cllr Mhairi Threlfall echoed points made by Greens and activists who called on the Mayor to amend the plan before approving it at WECA – however the cabinet noted the plan without recommending any changes. North Somerset and B&NES councils had expressed concerns with the plan and proposed amendments to address the climate emergency.\n– On Wednesday the Council’s planning committee approved plans for the ‘YTL Arena’ at Filton in the north of the city. Green Councillors and others objected to the plans on transport congestion and environmental grounds. According to YTL’s plans the heating and maintenance of the structure will take 12 times the CO2 emissions of the previous Temple Island plan and in the developer’s ‘best case’ transport scenarios 70% of journeys to the site will be made by private car. Labour councillors voted en masse to approve it and the Mayor tweeted his support for the project. Transport campaigners such as Sustrans opposed the move.\n– On Thursday the administration’s representative on the Avon Pension Fund (appointed by the Mayor) affirmed his continued support for the policy of ‘engagement’ with fossil fuel companies, rather than divestment (pulling funding out of fossil fuel investments) which has been called for by Greens and environmental campaigners. Prominent cities in the ‘C40 cities’ group such as New York, London and Berlin have already committed to divestment. In July last year, Green councillors put a motion to the council calling on it to use its influence to push for divestment. The motion was backed by UNISON, the Council’s largest staff union – however the Labour group voted with Conservative Cllrs to amend the green motion to take no action.\n– Other Councils that declared a Climate Emergency after Bristol include Oxford, which launched a citizens assembly to deal with the issue and recently announced a £19m fund to act on the recommendations and Warwick district Council, which proposed a referendum on a radical hike in Council Tax to raise over £30m in ten years to tackle the Climate emergency.\n– While Council studies were still at an early stage in January 2019 Green councillors issued a report titled ‘Change Starts Now’ containing suggested projects to reach carbon neutrality that could be started as soon as possible. In January 2020 they proposed a motion that passed in Full Council to set up Citizens Assemblies including a pilot to focus on tackling the Climate Emergency. At council budgets in 2019 and 2020 Greens proposed a range of measures to allocate funding for Climate Emergency measures – in 2020 this included £10m on retrofitting and adding solar to council homes to reduce heating bills and carbon emissions and over £12m on ringfenced funding for public transport and walking and cycling improvements.",

The meeting has been organised by Green South West MEP Molly Scott Cato, and will be attended by the Vice President of the French Assembly, Denis Baupin.\nAnti-nuclear protestors and a white elephant will also join the group meeting outside the gates of Hinkley, to raise attention to the triple risks of security1, the risk of an energy gap2 and the risk associated with potential Chinese ownership3.\nHinkley point power station lies 50km from central Bristol. The French government has recently acknowledged the risks associated with the Pressurised Water nuclear reactor (EPR) model proposed for Hinkley C. The design has faced numerous problems, which have caused delays in both France and Finland1.\nMr Baupin said:\n“EPR was meant to showcase the expertise of France’s nuclear energy industry to the world. But it has turned into the most expensive and risky model possible. The many problems that have occurred with this design so far show we don’t even know how to build it properly! The UK still has an opportunity to say no to this industrial and financial disaster.”\nGreen Councillor Martin Fodor, who was the Local Government Association’s energy advisor and will be attending the meeting on Friday said:\n“Hinkley point C is quite simply a white elephant – a dangerous distraction to our urgent energy needs, which research has shown could be generated by renewable energy across the South West4. As the Telegraph noted earlier this year5, Hinkley C is over-budget, grossly subsidised and financially unsustainable. The EPR technology has encountered numerous problems in other countries1 and we don’t need this risky dinosaur on Bristol’s doorstep. Instead our residents desperately need practical solutions to keep warm, provide power, and create local green jobs, which investment in energy efficiency and renewables can deliver.”\nThe UK government is rumored to be ready to sign a deal with the Chinese to help fund Hinkley C, and Friday’s meeting comes ahead of a state visit by Chinese President, Xi Jinping to the UK later this month.\nMolly Scott Cato, Green MEP for South West England said:\n‘The government is leading us into a dangerous dark alley where we will face a serious energy gap and where a reliance on Chinese capital will threaten safety and environmental standards 3. Friday’s meeting and protest will send a loud and clear message to the government. Hinkley is too risky.

Similarly, if a music venue opens in a residential area, it too would be responsible for complying with residential requirements.\nAccording to the London Mayor, “developers building flats near existing venues will need to ensure that residents are not unduly affected by sound from the venue, and that may include paying for soundproofing.”\nGreen Councillors Martin Fodor and Steve Clarke have put forward a statement to Bristol City Council’s council meeting of 12 December, urging the Mayor to implement the ‘agent of change’ principle in Bristol to protect local music venues. In recent months, Thekla and multiple other music venues in the city have closed or come under threat of closure due to noise complaints.\nCommenting on the proposal, Cllr Martin Fodor said:\n“As our city’s housing stock increases this is a common-sense proposal that protects our city’s music venues. We hope the Labour mayor will adopt this green proposal to reassure the city’s thriving music scene.”\nCllr Steve Clarke said:\n“We live in a City where music and existing industrial uses (often of a heritage nature as in the shipbuilding) are integral to the fabric of our vibrant urban space. I do not want to end up with a monolithic fabric of residential and retail.”\nThe full statement reads:\nStatement by Councillors Stephen Clarke and Martin Fodor:\nWe should formally introduce an ‘Agent of Change’ Policy into the Local Plan.\nWe sit on DCA and DCB committees and there have been a number of recent occasions where concerns have been raised about new residential developments impacting on existing leisure outlets and businesses. The two that come to mind are the worries about the continuation of the Thekla as a music venue and the existing shipbuilding activity next to the proposed McArthurs Warehouse apartments adjacent to the SS Great Britain. The earlier development next to the Fleece is still current as it just completed construction.\nIn all these cases, the concern is that new apartments will be purchased or rented by people who then try to stop the existing potentially noisy operations which are happening next door. This is unacceptable in our view. We live in a City where music and existing industrial uses (often of a heritage nature as in the shipbuilding) are integral to the fabric of our vibrant urban space. We do not want to end up with a monolithic fabric of residential and retail.\nTo deal with this issue the Mayor of London has proposed a planning principle in the London Plan called ‘The Agent of Change Rule’. It says:\n‘Boroughs should ensure that planning decisions reflect the Agent of Change principle and take account of existing noise-generating uses in a sensitive manner when new development, particularly residential is proposed nearby…Boroughs should refuse development proposals that have not clearly demonstrated how noise impacts will be mitigated and managed.’\nIt continues:\n‘Development should be designed to ensure that established noise generating venues remain viable and can continue or grow without unreasonable restrictions being placed on them.’\nAt the moment we have no such principle in our planning policy documents. We, therefore, propose that we adopt a similar policy to the London one and we would ask that the Mayor promotes it as an important part of our Local Plan.\nSubmitted by: Councillors Stephen Clarke & Martin Fodor\nDate: 11 December 2017\nENDS",

Molly Scott Cato MEP and Jolyon Maugham QC of the Good Law Project have been pressing for the release of impact studies on 58 sectors of the economy and a report prepared by HM Treasury, comparing the predicted economic detriment of Brexit with the potential benefits of alternative free trade arrangements [1].\nMolly and Mr Maugham argued at today’s hearing that full public release of the studies are “of very considerable importance in informing public debate about the current negotiations regarding the UK’s proposed departure from the European Union [2].” However, the High Court judge, Justice Supperstone, argued that an adequate alternative remedy exists, namely through Freedom of Information (FoI) requests.\nResponding to the verdict, Molly said:\n“This is incredibly disappointing. So many attempts to release these studies through Freedom of Information requests have already been attempted and refused. British people are being denied access to evidence about the impact of Brexit on their lives.\n“Rightly, for any major infrastructure scheme like a new road or runway, a publicly available impact study is taken as read. But apparently, it’s OK to drag a nation through one of the biggest changes in our lifetimes without allowing people to understand the consequences.\n“Today’s verdict gives the government a green light to continue hiding these studies on the economic impacts of Brexit from the public. The Buzzfeed leak a few weeks ago did reveal – in part at least – some of the impact assessments we had been requesting. But this information has not, of course, been made fully available to the public. The leak also showed why the government is so keen to keep a lid on this information.

The plan calls for the car companies who cheated emissions to foot the bill for action on air pollution.\nThe report also calls on the Government and Local Authorities to take specific measures to mitigate the risks in Brighton and Hove, Bristol, London and Oxford.\nThe key findings of the report, include:\nIn Bristol, air pollution is worst in Central, Lawrence Hill, and Ashley while and continues to rise in many areas across the city, including at the Bristol Royal Infirmary Children’s Department\nThe Government’s plan will see an estimated 757 deaths in Bristol linked to NO2 air pollution by 2021\nPutney High Street and Oxford Street in London breached the hourly legal limit for air pollution around 1,400 times in just one year\nThe Government’s plan will condemn an estimated 53,272 deaths in London linked to NO2 air pollution by 2030\nAir pollution is an inequality issue in Oxford and those suffering the worst effects contribute least to the problem. Two-thirds of the areas exceeding EU legal limits on air pollution are among the top 5% most deprived areas in England – Carfax and Holywell. More than 60% of households in Carfax don’t have access to a car, almost half of households in Holywell don’t have access to a car\nBrighton and Hove is excluded from the Government’s air quality plan despite the three most polluted areas in the city registering air pollution levels at 230%, 189%, and 153% of EU legal limits\nMolly Scott Cato, Green MEP for the South West and the Party’s parliamentary candidate for Bristol West, said:\n“Bristol residents are victims of both a Labour government that pushed the benefits of diesel cars before the effects of diesel emissions were well understood and a Conservative government that well understands the effects but continues to display a scandalous and deadly indifference to the issue.”\n“In Bristol, the toxic fumes spewed out by road vehicles are expected to claim the lives of more than 700 people before 2021. It is entirely unacceptable. And the Conservatives’ consistent failure to take any action over this crisis is truly despicable. These deaths are preventable. They have produced a feeble plan so lacking in detail and so non-committal that it will do nothing at all to help alleviate the air pollution crisis in Bristol.”\nKeith Taylor, Green MEP for the South East and a member of both the European Parliament’s Public Health and Transport Committees, said:\n“It’s a scandal that the Government is still displaying such a shocking disregard for the UK’s legal and moral obligation to take action on air pollution; it is a shameful indictment of the Tories’ irresponsible and deadly apathy. Every week Ministers fail to act, another 770 lives are needlessly lost across the UK.\n“As Greens, we support an air pollution plan that would truly tackle this emergency – and force companies to pay their way for the damage they done to people’s health.

According to the office for national statistics, in the financial year ending March 2024, there were 107 homicides in England and Wales. Of these, 83 were women, and 66 of these victims were killed by a partner or ex-partner. All but six were killed by a male suspect.\nThe stats for domestic abuse are similarly alarming, The crime survey for England and Wales estimated that approximately 7 in 100 women and 3 in 100 men experienced domestic abuse in the same time frame.\nOf 2.3 million domestic abuse cases, there were only 38,766 convictions; a 17% conviction rate. This is not good enough, and the police and justice system need to do more to get convictions.\nThese statistics highlight the reason why women have to come together to discuss issues facing us on a daily basis.\nI’ve been a Bristol city councillor for four years now, so every year when International Women’s Day (IWD) comes around on March 8, I see it as a pivotal platform to support and empower women and girls in Bristol.\nThe 2025 celebration, organised by Bristol Women’s Voice, is set to return to City Hall, and will feature panel discussions on topics like women’s economic inequality, health, global feminism, and women in the arts. Things that affect women everywhere, every day.\nI’m also looking forward to a variety of workshops focusing on music, well-being and history, as well as a host of informative talks.\nThese events not only raise awareness about the challenges women face but also foster a sense of community and solidarity. By coming together on International Women’s Day, we can encourage collective action towards creating a safer environment for women and girls.\nIn an era where the president of the USA, a man who has been found liable for sexual assault, has said ‘We will protect women, whether they want it or not’ – this feels more needed than ever.\nImagine being told that you cannot take the bus home alone after dark for your own safety. As a councillor, I hear from women and girls who are too scared to catch the bus when it is dark. If women don’t experience a basic level of safety when out, then all of our freedoms are at risk.\nIn response to this and the alarming statistics above, local organisations and authorities have intensified their efforts to combat violence against women and girls.\nBristol Women’s Voice, for instance, has been instrumental in advocating for women’s rights and safety. Their initiatives, such as the Bristol Zero Tolerance project, aim to tackle gender-based violence, abuse, harassment, and exploitation across the city.\nBristol City Council is also doing work in this area, is proud to give £2.5m each year to domestic and sexual violence services and will continue to do so.\nThe Bristol domestic abuse and sexual violence strategy for 2024 to 2027 also outlines a framework for partners to collaborate with individuals and communities.\nThe goal is to overcome barriers and ensure survivors of all backgrounds can access appropriate support.\nThe vision is to eradicate domestic abuse and sexual violence in all areas of the city, support all victim-survivors, challenge unacceptable behaviour, and hold perpetrators accountable.\nWhile Bristol faces significant challenges in addressing violence against women and girls, the concerted efforts of local organisations, authorities, and community events like International Women’s Day play a crucial role in supporting and empowering women.\nThrough continued advocacy, awareness, and strategic action, there is hope for a future where women and girls in Bristol can live free from violence and abuse.

The Green party takes a holistic view of economics. Rather than limiting themselves to a review of the Mayors’ budget proposals the Greens have looked at the national and regional context. Greens have reviewed the West of England Local Enterprise Partnership’s Economic strategy and found it wanting. They have also made several suggestions on how the Mayor could raise money to offset some cuts. The current city deal stands out from other city deals in excluding the low carbon Agenda and ignores South Bristol.\nDaniella Radice, said, “The West of England LEP’s economic plan is wildly unambitious. It needs powerful and cross-cutting themes that will enable the West of England to go from strength to strength. We think that we should aim to be the most resource efficient region, in all sectors. If we can do this we will gain skills that we will be able to sell to the rest of the world. The Region should also aim to be the best at enabling flexible working, allowing those with caring responsibilities to be economically active.”\nTess Green, said, “Greens call for a rise in council tax by a modest 2% and for protection for those who cannot afford this. We also believe that savings can be made by charging visitors from outside the city for museum visits, by reducing costs of the Lord Mayor’s and councillors’ transport and by introducing a workplace parking levy in central Bristol”\nGus Hoyt, Cabinet Member for Neighbourhoods said, “To add insult to injury the government let us down concerning the new powers and we are now stuck with the weak Lib Dem City Deal.”\nCllr Rob Telford (Ashley), the Green Party’s national spokesperson on democratic reform said: “The Coalition government’s championing of mayoral systems and the extra central government funding they would bring have failed to materialise except in the form of a City Deal that doesn’t put Bristol’s interests first. The Mayor should be banging at their door – as he said he would – for a better City Deal that puts the low carbon economy at its centre.”\nSee related document, Bristol Green Councillors’ Budget Response, A wider look at Bristol’s Economy.",

This is the question that Mayor Marvin Rees proposes to bring to September’s cabinet meeting with a recommendation.\nWhen this question is being addressed we would expect to see the term ‘best’ encompass social, cultural and environmental considerations as well as pure economic and employment considerations.\nHowever, looking specifically (and only) at the economic and employment considerations, Marvin has said that the best economic and employment outcome for Bristol could be to not build an arena on Temple Island. He has stated that it is difficult to walk away from the potential alternative uses of Temple Island. As a Green, I’m all for looking at the evidence on the alternative uses of Temple Island, so where do things stand on this at the moment?\nMarvin said, “I have to consider the Value for Money Report that says that… a mixed use site including a conference centre, hotel and residential brings an economic output of over 900 million pounds and over 2000 jobs.” Of course, this ‘value for money’ report had no calculations of the social, environmental and other impacts of this decision, let alone the enormous effect that rejecting a city centre arena for an out of town site would have on the city centre economy.\nYou might get the impression from listening to the Mayor that these numbers had been generated and thoroughly assessed by KPMG, who drafted the report. So where do these numbers come from and can we rely on them? Buried in the detail of the KPMG report it states, “Although alternative use plans for the Temple Island site have not yet been fully developed Bristol City Council has undertaken an initial ‘land use optioneering’ exercise to consider and develop potential options for the site.”\nSo, at this stage, it’s solely on the basis of the Council’s own obscure calculations that KPMG has noted down that a conference centre, hotel, 460 homes, and shops and offices could be fitted onto the relatively small plot of land where it is planned that the arena will be located.\nThe council then builds on these assumptions to generate some even more extravagant employment numbers. The council told KPMG that over 1800 full time jobs could result directly from the alternative Temple Island development. While the informal response to this number of jobs on this relatively small plot of land might be, “You must be having a larf!” the equivalent response of the professional services is more restrained: “KPMG has not validated Bristol City Council’s estimates of the direct employment associated with the Temple Island site.”\nIn other words, the experts engaged by the council have declined to provide professional judgement on the numbers provided by Marvin’s own staff that form the basis of any claims that alternative uses of Temple Island will generate higher employment and economic activity.\nSo in summary, at this stage, councillors and KPMG have seen no proper alternative use development plans for Temple Island – all we have is numbers from a back of the envelope style ‘land use optioneering’ exercise that has been carried out by Marvin’s staff. Even if accurate, these numbers would be insufficient to support an informed decision as they say nothing about the social, cultural or environmental impacts of the decision the Mayor faces.\nFinally, as with the vague assertions made around the Filton arena, these unverified numbers are then being repeatedly requoted and weighed against the statistics for a Temple Meads arena as if they were equally valid.

The Greens have a 2% lead in the constituency based on recent local election results[3] and are tipped to take the seat next year.\nNatalie Bennett the leader of the Green Party of England and Wales is in Bristol today to offer her support:\n“Darren Hall is a fantastic candidate and has already been an advocate for Bristol on an international stage,” said Ms Bennett.\n“The Green Party has majority support here in Bristol West based on recent local election results. If people in each neighbourhood vote the same way they voted in their last local election, Bristol West will have a Green MP by May next year. This is great news for the city.”\nDarren Hall, is a company director and former manager of the Bristol Green Capital Partnership where he project managed the team that won the European Green Capital Award 2015 for Bristol. Darren has previously worked for the Home Office as a Regional Crime & Drugs Manager; has managed Gloucestershire’s flood recovery programme on behalf of the Cabinet office; and worked as Head of Organisational Development advising the Government Office of the South West. Darren runs Big Green Week festival in the city, and has lived in Bristol for 13 years.\nDarren Hall said: “Bristol has always been a community that wants to stand on its own two feet. Only a Green MP can truly deliver a leadership that doesn’t conform to old party lines, that is democratic, that doesn’t let people down, that listens. As an MP, I would stand up for the people and interests of Bristol at all costs, rather than having to toe any party line.”\n“Greens have been working alongside Bristol’s creatives and green experts for over 20 years to mould a vision for a more sustainable future for our city, but without an advocate in Westminster we are unable to make the vital changes we need. I’m excited to be starting out on this campaign to help us engage with innovative solutions on how to make Bristol work.”\nDarren Hall is challenging Liberal Democrat Stephen Williams MP, and Labour’s Thangham Debonnaire, who is also standing for the seat. The contest is likely to be a closely fought three-way marginal, based on recent local election results showing the Greens are currently in the lead with 28% support across the constituency, followed closely by Labour with 26%, and 24% going to the Lib Dems.[3]\nPolling websites such as voteforpolicies.org.uk demonstrate that a majority of voters across the country prefer Green policies to those of all other parties, but many vote tactically believing that smaller parties don’t have a chance in general elections.\n“The Green Party are encouraging residents to take a fresh look at how and why they vote in 2015,” said Daniella Radice, leader of the Green group on Bristol City Council. “Tactical voting in Bristol has repeatedly led to disappointment. People wanting a fresh approach to politics are more and more turning to the Greens to deliver it; an approach that is based on fairness and on bringing communities together.”\nBrief biography of Darren Hall:\nDarren began his career as an RAF Engineering Officer. After completing an MBA with the Open University in 2000, Darren returned to public service undertaking a number of different roles for the Home office; becoming the Regional Crime & Drugs Manager located in Bristol as part of Government Office for the South West (GOSW); managing Gloucestershire’s flood recovery programme on behalf of the Cabinet Office; undertaking a secondment to support Bristol’s Local Strategic Partnership; and finally taking up post as Head of Organisational Development advising the GOSW Board. His most recent role was as Manager of the Bristol Green Capital Partnership where he project managed the team that won the European Green Capital Award 2015.\nDarren is the founding Director of www.thepaleblue.org, and is the founder and editor of Good Bristol magazine (www.goodbristol.com).

Whilst we often hear sound bites and read references to inclusion, COVID 19 induced lockdown and ‘home schooling’ has painfully re-exposed inequalities in the starkest way. It has become clear that school children, elders, students and those on a low income are being left behind as important parts of life shift further online.\nGreen Party Councillor and artist Cleo Lake, who runs dance classes for elders in Bristol, became immediately concerned about all the elders whose clubs and classes were cancelled. Knowing these clubs to be an important life line she considered how she might help fill the void.\nCouncillor and artist Cleo Lake said:\n“I decided to restart the weekly class online, but I was aware that many do not have a smart phone let alone a laptop or computer. These elders would not be able to access the online session until they get support to be online. It was also really hard hearing of elders and friends of mine who had passed away. This made me further reflect on the issue of isolation and how many would not be able to pay their respects via a Zoom funeral. It became something I felt deeply saddened and moved by.”\n“At the same time I understood and reflected upon my own privilege. I have a smart phone, laptop and iPad which makes it easy for me to do work from home and for my 10 year old son to study either with the work emailed from school directly or utilising the multitude of education platforms available such as BBC bitesize. I know this isn’t the case for everyone and children will be failed in this period if they can’t access support and resources. I also considered the people who would normally rely on public resources like library computers – how are they now getting online?”\nCleo Lake’s concerns led to her pulling support together from Avon Fire & Rescue (Cleo is an Avon Fire Authority Member, Chairing the People & Culture Committee), Bristol Waste and Bristol Computer Reuse. She is launching #GiveNTech – a tech amnesty where unused IT hardware is donated, wiped of data, cleaned, fixed and given to those who need it. The pilot starts next week in-house at Avon Fire & Rescue, appealing to their 800 plus staff network to donate kit. Should more be needed then the campaign will appeal to the public to donate.\nVaughan Jenkins, Area Manager for Avon Fire and Rescue Service said:\n“Avon Fire and Rescue Service are proud to support the #GiveNTech #TechAmnesty and we are asking all our staff to donate any unused ICT equipment as we value the importance of reaching out to assist those members of our communities who may be digitally excluded at this time. In the modern age so much information is shared digitally and if anything we can do as a Service can potentially assist a student in their extended studies away from School, College or University or enable an older person to become digitally included then we are only too happy to part of this excellent initiative”.\nBristol Waste were also quick to support. Joanna Dainton, the Reuse coordinator at Bristol Waste said:\n“We are proud to play our part in getting unwanted electronic devices to people across the city who desperately need them at this difficult time. Our award-winning Reuse team are delighted to support the #TechAmnesty by PAT testing devices which have been cleansed of data and function tested by Bristol Computer Reuse, as well as helping with the move the items between locations. Our work to find new homes for pre-loved items, saving them from going to waste, and in this case providing essential communication devices to those in need, has never been so vital.”\nFounded in 2008, Bristol Computer Reuse created a citywide project with the aim of making affordable desktop computers and laptops available to individuals and families on low incomes or facing other challenges. Co-founder Andrew Town said:\n“We want Bristol to be a truly inclusive and connected digital city where everyone who would like a computer at home can have one, regardless of age, income or background. Computers and the internet are a part of everyday life. Access to a home computer helps people stay in touch, connect to public services, improve employment opportunities and encourage further education. If you are not connected we want to help you get your first computer.”\nCouncillor Lake has reached out to Bristol Council to ask for its support with the scheme. She added:\n“Although It has been hard to grasp exactly who is doing what in terms of digital inclusion, I do know that other organisations and charities for example Creative Youth Network have been independently funded to distribute tablets to young people, but cannot meet demand. I have been talking to officers at Bristol City Council to identify what other action is in place and to confirm Council support for the #GiveNTech scheme. If Council support for this scheme can be confirmed quickly then it could be scaled up to reach a lot more people in need.\n“It is fantastic that the #GiveNTech project partners have come together to step in and try to support the city to meet demands of getting people tech to get online. One school alone that I am aware of currently need 40 laptops and fear widening inequality gaps should lockdown persist. I have been thinking about the challenge of digital exclusion before now but this period has caused me to take action.\n“I am happy that this project also encourages sharing of resources and has a good reuse ethos. Some schools will be able to support students with data and WiFi packages and many are trying to do an audit regarding this, so after we get the kit the next stage will be finding solutions to assist people who cannot afford to get broadband to get online.”",

For years – as a councillor and before I was elected – I have been campaigning for policies that work towards appropriate and affordable housing for everyone. This includes housing built and maintained to high environmental standards (for the sake of our bills and for preventing climate change), introducing rent controls, and regulating landlords.\n“There is still a long way to go, but landlord licensing is a very important tool for protecting the rights of tenants. It will bring up the standard of rented properties across the city. And importantly, permitting local authorities to inspect privately-rented property as a matter of course will protect tenants from the revenge evictions that too-often follow when tenants make complaints.\n“If you are or have been a private tenant in a shared house, or are the parent, sibling or friend of someone who is (that’s most of us!), please take a few minutes to respond to this consultation supporting the proposal.”\nBackground\n– Councillor Denyer has been campaigning on this issue for a while. For example, this press release from August 2016.\n– Licensing places conditions on the landlord/agent to ensure that minimum property standards are met and that good management practice is delivered.

Several licences for shale gas exploration have already been sold in the South West with more set to follow.\nDr Molly Scott Cato, lead Green Party European candidate in the South West, said:\n“George Osborne’s declaration that he wants to extract ‘every last drop’ of oil and gas out of the ground demonstrates his utter contempt for local communities, people’s health and the environment. This winter we have seen the consequences of a changing climate here in the South West with violent storms and floods. But the Tories, together with their Lib Dem partners, want us to extract and use yet more of the fossil fuels causing the problem. The industrialisation of our countryside that fracking would cause could be a disaster for a region reliant on tourism, agriculture and increasingly, innovative renewable energy projects. There is no evidence to suggest that shale gas will mean cheaper energy or lower fuel bills [2]. The way to stop people dying because they can’t afford to heat their homes is by massive investment in insulation and energy efficiency, not fracking.”\nGreens have outlined five key reasons why allowing fracking in the region could have devastating impacts on health, the rural environment, the local economy, local democracy and the climate [see details below].\nThe Green Party is the only UK political party that wants a complete ban on fracking. They want to see a massive investment in energy efficiency measures and home insulation as well as support for renewable energy technologies. They are urging people in the South West to join their campaign against fracking by signing a petition set up by the Green Party. [3]\nNotes:\nFive reasons why the Green Party is opposed to fracking in the South West\nHealth: the fracking process uses chemicals and water injected under pressure into rocks deep underground to release gas with the potential to contaminate our water supply\nThe rural environment: for shale gas extraction to be economically viable requires a large numbers of wells set at regular intervals. The hundreds of rigs, associated equipment and lorries would industrialise the South West’s beautiful environment and landscapes.\nLocal economy: the South West is a region that has great potential for Green Tourism, food production and renewable energy generation. Industrialising our beautiful countryside and agricultural land with thousands of rigs, and all the accompanying noise and light pollution from machinery and lorries, will damage the potential of these industries.\nLocal democracy: the Government is using planning law to make it easier for fracking companies to march in, ignoring local people’s wishes. In an act of desperation to impose deeply unpopular fracking on communities the government has set about bribing local authorities by offering 100% of business rates from fracking activities back to local communities.\nClimate change: scientists agree that two-thirds of fossil fuel reserves must stay in the ground if we are to avoid dangerous climate change. Fracking is an extreme method of extracting yet more fossil fuel out of the ground; the exact opposite to what scientists believe we should be doing. Shale gas extraction also leaks large amounts of methane – a very strong greenhouse gas – into the atmosphere.\n[1] http://www.carolinelucas.com/media.html/2014/03/21/my-trial\n[2] http://www.carbonbrief.org/blog/2013/07/will-shale-gas-mean-cheaper-energy-bills\n[3] http://my.greenparty.org.uk/civicrm/petition/sign?sid=3&reset=1",

They point to the fact that the Labour Party made no attempt to take back the railways while in government and that a Railways Bill, introduced in the House of Commons by Green Party MP Caroline Lucas [1], failed to get significant Labour support.\nLead Green Party South West European candidate, Molly Scott Cato, said:\n“Labour have arrived too late to catch the renationalisation train; it has already left without them, though they can’t seem to make up their minds whether they want to be aboard or not. They made no attempt at renationalisation during their 13 years in office and failed to support a Private Members Bill put forward by Caroline Lucas calling for the railways to be taken back into public ownership. And it was the Greens, not Labour, who set up a petition calling for the Great Western franchise to be taken back into public ownership [2].”\nThe Greens are the only political party fully committed to taking back the railways into public ownership as and when individual franchises expire or companies fail to meet the conditions of their contracts. This could, argue the Greens, save the Government over £1 billion a year. They point to the success of the publicly-owned East Coast mainline franchise which has delivered millions of pounds back to the Treasury.\nMolly concluded:\n“For Labour to start talking about renationalisation now, just two weeks before the European elections, shows they are desperate to try and shore up the left vote and really cannot be trusted. They know that in the last European elections in the South West, the Green Party received more votes than Labour. They are probably also aware, as are the public, that our policies on railways, energy, trade and banking demonstrate clearly that a vote for the Green Party is a vote for a Party that is genuinely left of centre.”\nNotes\n[1] Caroline Lucas launches Private Members Railways Bill: http://www.carolinelucas.com/media.html/2013/10/17/caroline-launches-bill-to-bring-railways-into-public-hands/\nFull text of Private Members’ Bill: http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/2013-2014/0081/14081.pdf\n[2] e-petition: Take back the Great Western franchise into public ownership: http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/petitions/56244",

She said:\n“Workers’ rights are under attack from all sides. The government’s bill seeks to severely restrict the ability of trade unions to fundraise, carry out industrial action and coordinate effectively in the workplace. All of this could be made worse still by TTIP1, the proposed EU-US trade deal, which threatens to undermine labour standards across Europe. Both of these devastating pieces of legislation must be stopped.”\nThe support follows a strong showing by Green Party campaigners at a rally in the city centre this week, where Tony Dyer, Green candidate for Mayor (pictured2), spoke in clear opposition to the bill and in favour of Bristol’s right to strike.\nCouncillor McMullen, a member of UNITE and a campaigner for workers’ rights in the garment industry will also speak to the motion. She said:\n“Bristol is massively fortunate to have a thriving trade union movement that has campaigned for decades on progressive policies to improve our labour market, such as the living wage, opposing zero hour contracts, and for decent working conditions for Bristol workers.

Yesterday (Wednesday 18th October) the first of Bristol Council’s two planning committees approved a change to make housing developers’ viability studies public. These viability studies are used to justify proportions of affordable housing (or the lack thereof) in developers’ planning applications. Previously the only people with access to these documents were the housing developers themselves and council officers, making it difficult for councillors to challenge planning proposals that included low proportions of affordable housing. From December developers will need to include their viability report at the start of their application process to develop in Bristol.\nGreen Development Control (planning) committee members welcomed the increased transparency but challenged the high returns for developers which remain built in to the process.\nGreen Councillor Steve Clarke, who proposed the successful Council motion that led to the change, said:\n“There has always been a certain amount of mystery around these viability reports and that lack of transparency has bred mistrust; basically people don’t believe them. The fact that they will now be routinely available on the planning website is a huge step forward in rebuilding that trust with the process. Concerned citizens will be able to examine them in detail and test the assumptions (and arithmetic) that has been used. This is exactly in line with the Green Party Group’s aspirations for greater openness and accountability in council processes and we will be looking for other areas where light can be shone on dark corners of decision making processes.”\nClifton Down Councillor Clive Stevens, a member of the committee that voted for the proposal said:\n“This visibility is long overdue, in fact the latest planning calculations show a need for even more affordable housing over the coming 20 years. Before now, rogue developers could hide or delay providing this vital information until the last minute and then amazingly appeal to an inspector because the Council took more than the prescribed 13 weeks to decide. From 1st December we will be able to stop this behaviour which in my view is almost criminal and costs the residents of Bristol a great deal due to higher rents.”\nGreen Councillor Martin Fodor added:\n“We still have to deal with the government imposed viability test, which builds in assumptions of 20% profits for developers. But at least this new policy allows some transparency of where developers’ assumptions conflict with the council advisers’ figures.\n“In a recent committee session, council planners and the developer disagreed over build cost and specification assumptions – details that were not visible to the councillors sitting on the committee. As a result we never reached agreement and only a limited number of affordable homes were offered by the developer. Given the severe lack of affordable housing in the city at least committee members will now know what the developers’ assumptions are.”\nBackground:\nThe vote passed on 18 October in Development Control Committee A and is due to come before Development Control Committee B on the 8th November, where it is expected it will pass.\nGuardian article covers how developers exploit the secrecy of viability assessments https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jun/25/london-developers-viability-planning-affordable-social-housing-regeneration-oliver-wainwright",

Sometimes people feel there is no point in responding, as they think they will not be listened to anyway, but as your local Green councillors we will be working hard to make sure your voice is heard.”\n“The context since these cuts were first proposed has changed, and we are now in a much stronger position to oppose the Tory austerity budget that underlies them. There are hints from Number 10 that Theresa May could be retreating from austerity, and we want to see Labour pushing the Tories on this issue, not continuing to implement Tory cuts as they have done in Bristol over the last year. Bristol sent out a clear message last week that they are not content to sit by and have services slashed around them. They put their faith in Labour to stand up against austerity.”\n“As Bristol now has a Labour mayor, a Labour majority on the council and 4 Labour MPs representing it, surely there is no excuse for Labour not to do what they were elected for – they should use the momentum they have now to work across the core cities (the 10 largest cities outside of London) and push the government to accept that the cuts to local government funding are completely unachievable, and will have a devastating effect. We will be more than happy to support the administration if they do.”\n“As Greens we are passionate about quality of life, and the areas being cut here – support for adults with disabilities, school crossing patrols, libraries, public toilets, and local democracy through the neighbourhood partnerships – all have a big impact on people’s quality of life. There is much talk of enabling community leadership, but we believe that cutting local services and simply expecting over-burdened charities and volunteers to pick up the slack is neither feasible nor fair.”\n“We will continue to oppose Tory austerity and to hold Labour to account and would urge the citizens of Bristol to speak up for the services they value.”",

Greens are demanding that this should put to bed the debate about the impact of such limits.\nThe report noted “statistically significant reductions in average traffic speeds of 2.7mph across the city of Bristol, following the introduction of 20mph speed limits…a larger reduction than seen in previous evaluations in other cities.”\nEmploying “a more sophisticated analysis than previous studies of 20mph limits”, including controlling for other factors and using speed data from over 36 million vehicle observations, the report found “a reduction in the number of fatal, serious and slight injuries from road traffic collisions, equating to estimated cost savings of over £15 million per year.”\nGreen councillor Charlie Bolton – who has campaigned for a number of years both to implement and to retain the limits, said:\n“We believe this report was commissioned by the council for its review of 20mph. It clearly shows that 20mph has saved lives in Bristol, cut serious and less serious accidents and saved a lot of money. We all know that it also creates an environment which benefits pedestrians, cyclists, the elderly, those in wheelchairs, those with visual disabilities. It makes more people feel safe to walk or cycle and as such it is good for both health and the environment.”\nLeader of the Green group of councillors Eleanor Combley also welcomed the report, saying:\n“With these amazing impacts it’s no wonder a clear majority – over 70% – of people in Bristol support 20mph, as demonstrated repeatedly in surveys conducted by the Council and UWE. The Labour administration seem intent on ignoring this compelling evidence of the benefits for everyone in the city and are still talking up the possibility of rolling 20mph limits back in their newly announced consultation.

  "https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_/https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_ipcc-climate-report-means-time-is-running-out/content_165.html": "menu\nBristol Greens have called on the Government and Bristol Council to take emergency action in response to the latest report from the IPCC, which says humanity has just a decade left to make rapid and drastic reductions in greenhouse gases or face widespread climate devastation.\nThe UN Secretary General António Guterres called the IPCC’s report “code red for humanity” and warned that “there is no time for delay and no room for excuses”. The report, released less than three months before the key COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, says human activity has “unequivocally” caused rapid and some irreversible changes to the global climate. It calls for urgent action to cut emissions and stabilise warming to a 1.5°C increase. Beyond this level, at 2°C and higher, the impact of climate change would become even more serious and intense.\nCouncillor Carla Denyer, the Green Group’s Shadow Cabinet member for Climate and Ecology, said:\n“We’ve all seen the devastation caused by recent floods in Germany and fires across the world – the IPCC report is clear that extreme weather and flooding is intensifying and will only worsen as our planet gets hotter. Bristol already faces a high flooding risk – according to a council report, 23,000 residential properties are currently at risk of tidal and surface water flooding. In the long term the IPCC report notes that even with warming constrained to 1.5°C (which will take a serious effort) we could see a rise in sea levels of two to three metres. Under the worst scenarios we could see that level of increase much sooner. And flooding doesn’t just affect those in low-lying areas. For every person who suffers flooding, around 16 others are affected by a loss of services such as transport and power.\n“Global warming is no longer a hypothetical problem for some people in the distant future to solve. Climate change is already here affecting us, and it’s only going to get more extreme if we fail to act – policymakers cannot afford to keep delaying and dithering. But if there’s one glimmer of good news from the IPCC’s report it’s this – it’s still not too late to make a difference. If countries work together and act fast we still can avoid the worst possible outcomes for our planet. The COP26 climate summit the UK is hosting in October could be a turning point for the world. As host nation the UK has a chance to lead by example – for too long all we’ve heard from the Conservative government is pledges and fine words with no action to back them up. We urgently need investment in housing insulation and public transport – a Green New Deal for the UK.”\nFellow Green Councillor and co-Shadow Cabinet member Lily Fitzgibbon added:\n“But it’s not enough to wait for national governments to act – we must take action locally as well. In 2018 Bristol declared a climate emergency, following a motion Carla put to the council, and set a bold target for the city to go carbon neutral by 2030. At the time there were twelve years to act – there are now just nine left. But much like the government in Westminster, there’s been a lot of talk but little real action from Bristol Council. In the Labour Mayor’s previous term, his party repeatedly blocked Green proposals to tackle the climate emergency – divesting pensions from fossil fuels, funding to retrofit council houses, an annual budget for new cycle infrastructure. I hope Bristol will see more engagement with Green ideas from the Labour administration now the evidence is so overwhelming and the stakes are so high. We need to put the city on a footing to a cleaner, greener future and we can’t afford to wait for the private sector or the government to come to our rescue.”\nBefore Lily was elected as Green councillor this May, she was co-founder and organiser of Bristol Youth Strike for Climate, who organised youth strikes against Airport expansion throughout the Summer of 2019, as well as Greta Thunberg’s visit to Bristol last February. Lily recently clashed with the Labour Mayor over his support for Bristol airport’s expansion plans. She added:\n“One immediate issue we need local authorities to challenge is Bristol Airport’s plans for expansion. This is the biggest climate decision our city and region have faced in decades. If approved the airport’s expansion would generate an extra million tons of CO2 each year, making a mockery of Bristol’s carbon targets. The airport is currently appealing North Somerset’s decision to reject these plans – now is a crucial time and Marvin Rees must get off the fence and make a clear statement to the planning inquiry to object to the airport’s proposals.”\nNotes",

However Bristol’s Labour Cabinet went ahead and approved the plans on 4th March without recommending changes, despite Greens being joined in opposition on the issue by activists from Extinction Rebellion, transport campaigners and even Labour’s former transport lead Mhairi Threlfall.\nThe Joint Local Transport Plan approved by the regional authority has been criticised by transport experts such as UWE’s Dr Steve Melia as while it contains references to public transport and other schemes, it only commits funding to road building projects. Decades of research on the phenomenon of ‘induced demand’ illustrates that far from reducing traffic, new road building schemes in fact increase congestion.\nReacting to the decision taken by the Combined Authority, Green councillors said the plan was “a defunct plan for a bygone era” that would only worsen congestion in the West of England and make it harder to tackle the climate crisis.\nCouncillor Steve Clarke chairs WECA’s Overview & Scrutiny Committee. In a statement to the meeting he highlighted uncertainties around timescales and decision-marking regarding the projects and schemes listed in the plan, and called on the plan’s projects to re-prioritised in light of WECA’s declaration of a Climate Emergency last year.\nPoliticians supporting the plan, such as Bristol’s Labour transport lead Kye Dudd, have suggested the plan is a ‘stop-gap’ and that it could be quickly reviewed to be made more climate-friendly. However, Councillor Clarke pointed out that the plan was a statutory document and that drafting a new plan or amending the current one could take years.\nReacting to the decision, Councillor Clarke said:\n“Having previously raised that the plan was potentially illegal and certainly incompatible in part with the Paris Accords, I’m glad to see that wording has been altered accordingly. However I still have real concerns about the plan – there have been claims that the plan could be quickly reviewed however in reality this process would take at least a couple of years. In the meantime WECA and its authorities have all declared Climate Emergencies and the plan needs to do much more to reflect this.”\nGreen Councillor Martin Fodor was one of the few attending the meeting to present statements in person. He pointed out three dozen statements tabled to the meeting and a dozen questions – all challenging the lack of consensus among the authorities and the contradictions in the plan’s policies.\nHe called for a resolution to set aside incompatible parts of the strategy and said:\n“Decades of evidence are clear – building more roads just creates more traffic. By funding road building but not committing anything for public transport or cycling and walking, this plan will only make our region’s transport problems and the climate crisis worse. Not only that, many of the developments the new roads are meant to connect to have been cancelled and won’t be submitted again.\n“This is a defunct plan for a bygone era – it prepares us for the past, not the future. Leadership means acknowledging when a mistake is about to be made, and changing direction, even if it’s difficult – by pushing this plan through and refusing to fix it first Marvin Rees and Tim Bowles have failed to pass that test.”\nPhoto: XR activists and Greens demonstrate outside City Hall",

Democracy and elections are about choice, about allowing voters to hear from all the candidates.

According to data recorded by the City Council, large areas of Bristol experience levels of air pollution above the legal and safe European limits. These include the sites of numerous primary schools around the city centre and near major roads such as the M32 and A38.\nBristol, despite being one of a number of cities which is breaching safety limits for air pollutants, is not on the government’s list of cities to get Clean Air Zones by 2020.\nGreen Party campaigners and parents are particularly concerned that even the worrying figures published do not reflect the true health costs to children, as they represent yearly averages rather than peak times, when many children are on their way to school\nElla Bissett Macewen, who is a parent at Dolphin School said:\n“The air pollution in Stokes Croft and the centre of Bristol is always really bad, my youngest child is prone to chest and breathing problems and has found it difficult doing the school run with his big sister. We travel across the city every day for school (from Windmill Hill to Cheltenham Road). We use public transport and the majority of the time we take the bus as this is the most frequent service. “\n“We have noticed over the last two years an increasing problem with the traffic in Bristol city centre. Particularly on the return journey from school the traffic jams can be so bad that the bus journey can take upwards of 40 minutes (normally it takes 20 minutes). The pollution is made much worse by the traffic jams as this means that all of the cars and buses are stationary with their engines on pumping out fumes into the increasingly high-rise urban landscape.”\nIn Bristol dangerous air pollution leads to nearly 200 deaths every year. The most affected are young children, the elderly, and people with heart and lung conditions such as asthma and cystic fibrosis.\nJerome Thomas, Green Party councillor for Clifton, has been researching the solutions.\n“Obviously reducing the amount of motor traffic on the roads is a key way of reducing air pollution, so investing in public transport, cycling and walking is crucial. But we also need stronger action than that – the most polluting vehicles need to be kept out of busy urban areas. That includes phasing out diesel vehicles and establishing a robust Clean Air Zone.”\nImage: Martin Abegglen https://www.flickr.com/photos/twicepix/7923685928/\nNotes:\nAir pollution can affect lung development in babies even before birth, reducing their adult breathing capacity and making them more susceptible to infections.\nThe autumn also brings an increase in common colds and other respiratory infections and air pollution can make these more severe, causing serious problems for children with asthma in particular.\nPassengers in cars may be inhaling even more traffic fumes than pedestrians.\nClean air is fast becoming a major public health issue, but there are ways of tackling the problem.\nhttp://www.airqualitynews.com/2016/02/16/higher-air-pollution-health-risk-inside-car-study-finds/\nhttps://www.foe.co.uk/page/uk-air-pollution",

This shows just how unlikely it is that we can trust them to deliver affordable housing.\n– These alternative proposals could also be built in a number of locations around the city, while a city centre arena can only go ahead at the Temple Meads site.\n– Once this site is sold Bristol is unlikely to get any arena for many years – there are a serious number of legal, planning, and other issues in the way of a Filton location.\n– If an arena were eventually built at Filton it would create enormous congestion and transport problems in the north of the city and drain business from the city centre.\nFor the avoidance of all doubt, the motion passed in Full Council yesterday evening, which the Mayor voted for, reads:\n“This Council believes that the best site for Bristol’s Arena, for the benefit of Bristol as a whole, is Temple Island in the centre of Bristol and that the decision taker should be guided by the vote at this meeting.”\nMost people reading those words would therefore have expected the Mayor to respect the democratic process, be guided by his councillors (and his own) votes and keep the Temple Quarter arena project instead of abandoning it for as-yet non-existent mixed development plans, gifting public land and assets to the private sector.\nUnfortunately it is increasingly clear that this Mayor has complete contempt for democracy – whether it’s the manifesto pledge he was elected on to “complete the new city Arena and enable it to be accessible to all communities”, the votes of councillors, including his own, at two separate meetings, the views of 10 out of 11 of the chief scrutiny committee, or the popular opinion expressed through online polls, petitions, and hundreds of public statements submitted to council meetings – at the end of the day the only view that matters to Marvin Rees is his own. Leadership surely means listening to others and not being afraid to change your mind if the evidence points another way – yet instead of putting Bristol first the Mayor has spun every which way in trying to present a decision he took months ago in secret as fair and transparent, and quell disagreements within his own party. The most recent of these efforts was his attempt to reframe last night’s motion and vote as being about the best site ‘in an ideal world’ rather than in this world, to try and allow him to say one thing on Monday and do the complete opposite on Tuesday.\nFirst the Temple Island arena was too expensive. Then an alternative project emerged to muddy the waters, owned by a company with links to many of the senior officers around the Mayor. Finally, after reports showed the Arena Island site to be both deliverable and affordable and the cost of the project shrank, it was deemed too risky, despite there being no evidence provided to support this. The Mayor seems to have got his economics mixed up with the Conservative government – at times of uncertainty we should be investing to support the city economy – we have seen on the national stage that austerity policies do not work.\nLet’s be clear: at cabinet today the Mayor has betrayed the spirit of his vote yesterday and acted against the best interests of the city – putting short term savings before long term gain, putting the private sector over a publically owned arena, and abandoning his manifesto commitment to deliver an arena for Bristol by 2020.",

ClientEarth are demanding this explanation within eight weeks.\nClientEarth has launched the letter citing a “massive shortfall in compliant local planning policy”. Bristol Council’s Local Plan sets local rules for all future commercial and housing development in the city so will have a significant impact on carbon emissions. Bristol Council is due to review the planning policies in its Local Plan, although the review is waiting for the regional Joint Spatial Plan that sits above it to be agreed, having been recently rejected by government officials.\nIn June Bristol’s Green Councillors submitted a set of suggested policies to the council’s consultation on its Local Plan. These included stronger planning rules on climate change to make a clear commitment to carbon neutrality for new developments. Greens also demanded stronger protections for public land and called for planning policies against advertising billboards and over-concentration of student housing in small areas of the city.\nCouncillor Martin Fodor commented:\n“As we said in June, the local plan needs to be revisited and the policies made more ambitious before the plan is signed off. We can’t waste a decade or more through the life of this plan if it does not take us towards net carbon neutrality at the pace required by the reports from the IPCC and Committee on Climate Change. So the published draft plan must be revisited to recognise the Climate Emergency declared by Council and aim for the 2030 target.”\nCllr Fodor added:\n“At the end of last year, Bristol led the way by passing a Green motion to declare a Climate Emergency – it was the first city in Europe to do so. But speaking the truth about the Climate Emergency is only the first step, it needs to be followed up with action. So in June we suggested some key changes to the Council’s Local Plan to put the response to that emergency at the heart of the Council’s planning policy. As well as measures to deal with climate change we put forward policies to protect public space, mitigate the housing crisis by cracking down on AirBnB properties, and incorporate social value policies in major developments.\n“But since the West of England’s regional plan (the Joint Spatial Plan) was thrown out in August, that will have to be sorted out before our local plan in Bristol can be updated – which I’m worried could take a year or more. This is really important if we’re going to deal with the Climate Emergency and I hope Bristol Council and WECA are treating this with the urgency it requires – we can’t afford to wait much longer to get Green policies in place, or for new affordable housing that is comfortable to live in and cheaper to heat. The legal risk from Client Earth only adds to the pressure to get this fixed.”",

But with the arena decision at cabinet last week that is what it feels like Bristol has done.\nMarvin, understandably, blamed austerity, which of course is an accolade of the Conservative party along with the bankers who played with our money like a game of monopoly. But whilst austerity is a reality we can chose how to respond to it.\nThe decision to ‘explore other options’ for the Arena Island site will do nothing but kick any decision into the long grass. A shrinking away from a decision to do anything for the city. The Mayor tries to pitch the decision as avoiding risk, staying safe and avoiding problems in the future but really it is no decision at all. The ‘alternative proposal’ for arena island appeared a week before the decision was made and is little more than a pretty picture. The promise of affordable homes has already been undermined by Legal and Generals insistence on building only 4 affordable homes (3%) on another development in the Temple Quarter. Marvin aimed to characterise the debate as those who are for housing or for entertainment. This is a false choice. A mixed use development and the housing we desperately need can be built on another site. There are many in the city centre.\nSo, we will be left with a derelict site that creates no affordable homes, no convention centre and no arena for a long while yet.\nWhy are we letting austerity dictate how our city should grow? The Mayor says ‘at times of jeopardy our appetite for risk should shrink’. I disagree – taking well thought through opportunities will make Bristol stand out from the crowd. Showing the UK and the world that we do get things done and we are not afraid of uncertainty but see it as an opportunity to grow and show off the best Bristol has to offer. Building an Arena on Temple Island is an investment in our future. Something fun for the people of Bristol and a great way of showing off our city to the region and the world. I think if we are really clever we could build the houses and convention centre nearby too.\nTimes of change are uncertain but to batten down the hatches, close off opportunities and turn inward misses the opportunities that still exist to make Bristol and even better place to be.\nSandy Hore-Ruthven is deputy coordinator for Bristol Green Party and the Green candidate for Mayor.",

We therefore applaud the devolving of transport, adult education, skills and planning powers.\nWe specifically welcome the devolution of transport powers. We have recognised for many years that for transport to progress, we need regional coordination and secure funding.\nWe welcome receiving the £30m per annum for 30 years\nThe core aim of the deal is defined as promoting economic growth. It is vital that promotion of equality and environmental protection are given the same priority as growth. As such, we welcome reference to promotion of equality and environmental protection in the documentation. However, assuming the deal is accepted, equality and climate change indicators must be key elements in the economic model that will be commissioned to define which projects get funding and used to measure success.\nWe have deep concerns about the way in which the devolution deal centralises power into the hands of the Metro-Mayor, and the three local authority leaders. In fact, the structure – apart from scrutiny, and as with the WoE partnership – specifically excludes opposition. We call on the Mayor of Bristol to work with other authorities to address this issue. We also call for the Metro-Mayor to be elected using proportional representation.\nStrong and effective scrutiny at combined authority level is vital for accountability. We need to be assured that scrutiny will be properly funded, and independent. We need the devolution scheme to demonstrate how this will be achieved.\nWe have concerns about how little councillors and local communities have been involved in developing the devolution deal and the rushed pace at which it has been developed. Councillors have not had the opportunity to input into the deal in a meaningful way. Final information on the deal has only been presented a few days before the decision has had to be made and there has been very limited scope for meaningfully suggesting changes or improvements.\nThe public consultation process will not be long enough to enable the public to input meaningfully, and there does not seem to be provision for the outcome of the consultation to change the details in the deal. The deal has been presented throughout as ‘take it or leave it’ which has limited the many ways in which it could have been improved and built upon.\nWe are concerned at the level of influence the LEP will have. We understand that the LEP will need to approve any rise in business rates. While we recognise that business could have a role to play in regional governance, we do not see why this should take precedence over others such as equality groups, the environmental sector, the voluntary sector and unions.\nIn addition to the above, although we are told that powers will not be delegated upwards without the constituent authorities’ consent, we are concerned that this only requires consent from the three Council leaders and not Full Council. We fear that over time powers will pass upwards without Full Council approval, and we strongly suspect that the budgets passed down will include cuts. At worst, we think it possible that this is the beginning of the end of the three local authorities who participate.\nThis is a far from perfect deal, but a strong commitment to equality and environmental protection, combined with a meaningful consultation process will make it more palatable to ourselves, and, we believe residents of the areas concerned.",

Even before 2014, the Greens were enjoying steady growth, both across the country nationally and in Bristol, but the rate of growth in Green Party membership has been staggering in recent months. Since the European election and the city council elections last year, membership of the Green Party in Bristol has increased by over 160%.\nIt is wholly appropriate that the 1000th member to join Bristol Green Party today should live in Ashley, which was the first ward in the city to elect Green councillors to both of its seats. The Greens also now hold both seats in Bishopston, and are making steady progress in all the council wards in the city, especially in Bristol West and Bristol South parliamentary constituencies, where they expect to make further gains.\nLast May, the Greens got their first Member of the European parliament in the South West with the election of Molly Scott Cato MEP, and the Greens doubled their number of councillors in Bristol to six. In the European election, Bristol Green Party took 20% of the vote in the city. Since these elections, it is clear that many more people are seriously supporting the Greens now that they realise that the Green party is winning more and more elections in the city, is likely to increase its number of councillors still further in May, and really can win in this year’s forthcoming general election, especially in Bristol West.\nThe people are joining Bristol Greens in ever increasing numbers because they can now see at last that there really is a political party which believes in social, environmental, and economic justice and which can win in order to deliver such a society. They know that the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats are destroying the NHS with their ‘reforms’ and privatisation of the NHS, and that the Labour Party indeed began the process of privatisation and cannot be trusted to protect the NHS. They know that only the Green Party will fight to protect all public services from privatisation, and will seek to bring both trains and buses back into public ownership, along with vital resources such as water; they know that only the Greens will protect our environment from exploitation by such terrible practices as fracking; and they know that only the Greens will fight seriously hard to stop the iniquitous TTIP agreement from destroying both the NHS and the hard-won environmental protections we currently have.\nFinally people now also realise it is only the Greens who will seek real economic justice by putting a stop to the avoidance of tax through the cynical use of tax havens, and will compel the banks and bankers to pay for the financial crisis which they forced on all of us, and most devastatingly on the poor. For this is the way that we can pay for a fairer society and reduction of the deficit (which everybody knows was caused by the bankers in any case), and not through the Con LibDem coalition’s practice of austerity which they are pledged to take further (and which the Labour Party has already said it will continue if elected in May).\nFor people who believe in a really environmentally caring, economically responsible, and socially fair society in Britain today, there really is only one choice – and that is the Greens.",

Responding to the trial’s outcome, she called on Bristol to seize the moment to challenge the power of the Merchant Venturers, who have members sitting on the Council committee that manages the Downs and control a number of schools in the city.\nShe said:\n“This is a great moment of hope for Bristol. For decades the democratic process to remove the statue failed. Not because of any doubt that it was harming our communities, but because of the influence of its defenders, the Society of Merchant Venturers. In the face of this acquittal we urgently need to address the capacity of this unelected elite to continue to wield significant power over our city.\n“It came out in court – there was clear evidence – that individuals in the organisation tried to interfere with the democratic processes. And as an elected member of the council, that is something that I will be taking up and we will be pushing for as myself as an individual and the Green Party.\n“It’s time we started honouring the thousands of our African ancestors that have been written out of history, and start building a society that doesn’t disadvantage their descendants.”\nFormer Green Councillor Cleo Lake, who as Lord Mayor made headlines when she had a portrait of Colston removed from her office, joined in celebrating the result.

It condoned the shrugging acceptance of racism. It celebrated the achievements of a racist mass murderer. The continued existence of that statue was a racist hate crime.’”\nShe added:\n“As we move forward as a city it will be important to have a dedicated museum or innovative space to accurately tell the full history but also to represent it in a way that might empower Afrikan Heritage communities, for example including information that predates the enslavement and colonisation that interrupted Afrika’s development.”\n“There is also much ongoing discussion about memorial/s to the Afrikan ancestors whose lives were so cruelly taken – some of this is referenced in the Project TRUTH report that will be launched on January 18th.”\nBackground\nImage – Defendant Rhian Graham (left), joins (left to right) former Green Lord Mayor Cleo Lake, defence barrister Raj Chada, Green Councillor Christine Townsend, and activist Jen Reid at press conference following the trial outcome.

I look forward to continuing to work together here and there over the year.\nBut what is a Lord Mayor? My earliest memory of Lord Mayor can be seen in this photo. I can’t remember who the Lord Mayor was at the time but I was no more than 4 when they visited my nursery school. We made the three cornered hats and large golden paper chains donned round our necks. We looked more like like a motley crew of Bristol pirates, and I guess that’s what most people think of when they think of the Lord Mayor, no not pirates but the chain the robe and possibly the triangle hat with black feathers. Cllr Alexander did mention that school children do ask where’s your hook?!\nIn fact being Lord Mayor is of course a huge privilege and responsibility – it’s a role of representing the city, of being Bristol’s ‘first citizen’ for a year. I’d like to thank some of the people who got me here – my parents Anne Cormack nee Campbell and my father Melbourne Hezekiah Lake. And the teachers who helped me – those at the nursery, and those who followed at Easton Road Primary Mr Hills and Mrs Willgress and Miss Pinner. Education plays such an important part in helping us reach for the future – I was lucky enough to be exposed to varied ideas, experiences and cultures which enabled me and my classmates (one of which is my Lady Mayoress Bianca Durrant) to travel in our imaginations. I recall our head teacher playing a plethora of classical music at most assemblies – Fanfare for the Common Man comes to mind, I enjoyed country dancing, and one teacher, Mr Hills – a man with a beard, long brown hair brown, brown cords, plaid shirt and sandals with socks, played the guitar and sang us Caribbean songs like ‘tingo layo’ whilst playing the guitar, and read us Anancy stories. My secondary school of which I had made up my mind to attend from the age of 5, from the school currently known as Colston Girls I wish in particular to thank and give credit to Mrs Hook and Mr Butcher.\nI grew up in Easton and enjoyed a great community spirit – from sharing delicious food with our next door neighbours, the Kaliks, at Eid, to enjoying the reggae played by Mr Jimmy at all hours across the road on a Saturday night – this was in a pre noise pollution monitoring or ASBOs era; Mrs Clark and her sister two dear pensioners spoiling us with treats at Christmas, the comforting sound of Bristolian being spoken loudly as long standing residents discussed business and gossiped back and forth and in and out each other’s houses. Bill Ivor and Bills elderly mum at the end of the street who adored my sister and I and who actually unofficially adopted us as her Granchildren just before she died, and we being very young and not knowing what that meant used to address her by saying ‘Hello adopted gran’… Joan an eccentric woman who supported our family endlessly; early days with the Selassie family just on the corner who remain close family friends; the Weetons next door with the immaculate hedge, Dennis with his pond of carp; and last but by no means least Mr and Mrs Smith, in fact my Lady mayoress’ grandparents, who provided us every summer without fail a share of their allotment harvest of plums and beans and various other produce. That was my street, thats where I grew up and that’s where I learnt. I cant say that I would have made it here today if I hadn’t of grown up there.\nAnd I hope besides some of the challenges my own family have experienced that my own children may reflect in as a positive way on their childhoods. Thank you to my three children Ashante Romany and Fitzroi who try to support me and I am very proud of you all but must tell you that you must do more around the house to quite literally pick up the pieces this year! I notice we had a Fitzroi in – 1958 Fitzroy George William Chamberlain – but not yet an Ashante or Romany at least not in name but who knows maybe in tribe.\nLooking back on our history in this city and the one of Mayor and later Lord Mayor it stretches back 800 years and is now into 802 years. The first Lord Mayor was in 1216 a Mr Roger Cordewaner – I didn’t want to ask any one how to pronounce that because didnt want to be corrected as its so much fun to say! I hope my year wont be full of getting peoples names wrong given that I am set to meet hundreds if not thousands of people.\nThe first woman was elected as Lord Mayor in 1963 Deputy Mayor Cllr Alexander was actually the 10th ever woman to be Lord Mayor given that one woman served twice, so that makes me the 11th female Lord Mayor in the 800 year old legacy. The others were and I list to honour them:\n1963 Florence Mills Brown\n1968 Mercia Evelyn Castle OBE, JP\n1971 Mrs Helen Bloom\n1986 Mrs Joan Jones\n1989 Mrs Kathleen Minnie Mountstephen\n1994 Mrs Claire Margaret Warren\n1995 Mrs Joan Barbara McLaren (dd 08.01.10)\n1996 Mrs Joan Barbara McLaren\n2001 Brenda Patricia Hugill\n2015 Clare Campion-Smith\nI hope tradition remains and allows for our names to be etched into stone amidst but in no way over shadowed by all those men’s names. I am a change on the wall a name on a brick but never just another brick in the wall. I, probably a bit like our New Duchess of Sussex if I may for a second compare myself to a royal princess, probably have very little in common with our early forerunners and for obvious reasons none of them that I can unearth were dancers! I am bringing some changes to the position – I am different from my predecessors – I am a dancer. For the last 10 years been the dance leader for the most incredible group The Malcolm X Elders Forum who meet weekly as a social club, providing activities and a hot lunch giving people a weekly dose of engagement and something to get out of the house for. They have not just provided me with work and support when I have needed it but they are my friends. My own father was a proud African man born in Jamaica and sadly passed away just hours after my 10th birthday. Engaging with the club also gave me an opportunity to re engage and learn about my roots and culture and is a testament to the power of intergenerational activity – something I look forward to developing this year.\nIt is of course an honour for my elders and my community at large me being first citizen of bristol in the same year as we celebrate 50 years of the St Pauls Carnival and 70 years since Windrush docked. It is testament to the distance travelled. So today I stand here quite possibly as my ancestors wildest dreams. Well unless thats my ancestors on my mothers side: Clarence Church Campbell and Pearl Bailey, aka Big Bill Campbell and Peggy Bailey sweetest voice of the West.\nMy grandfather was Scots Canadian. He had served in the airforce. And he is credited with pioneering country and western music in the UK.\nHe along with his rocky mountaineers also popularised the phrase ‘Mighty Fine’. But he and my maternal grand mother were also racists. This is an uncomfortable truth and a painful one when as a child the photo that my mother sent to her mother of my sister and I was opened then returned because of the colour of my skin and because the colours of my our skins did not match. In fact my mother was constantly confronted with questions and phrases such as your kids really confuse my kids….\nHistory is complicated and full of paradoxes, standing here as I do as a proud Bristolian Scots woman of African and Caribbean heritage. I have explored my African roots visiting Ghana several times and more recently Benin and Togo – I do hope there might be an opportunity to travel in my year I look forward to visiting Bordeaux one of Bristol’s oldest twins or maybe somewhere a little warmer or more likely colder especially as travel in office is to be self funded these days and rightly so perhaps… so looking for my roots, maybe? No. Yes! Scotland it is! Tracking down and calling in or calling on or heaven forbid calling out for some reason the Dukes of Argyle. Chiefs, clans and castles all sounds very romantic and a far cry from diamond socks with jeans tucked in a la Bristol circa 1991. It’s a long way to travel Scotland mind, I wonder if you can do it on one charge in a Tesla that’s a top of the range electric car?.. If not then I am minded of that wise thing a man once said I think on an advert: ‘I ain’t looking forward to the journey home neither!’\nI’m keen to explore the international relations Bristol enjoys – we’re twinned with a number of places. I’ve been informed by officers in the twining department the necessity of economic benefit when considering new partnerships and well preferably tangible links…. so I’m not yet sure what might be in it for Bristol as such or what tangible links we might have with Scotland, well apart from at least half of the public gallery is more than likely part Scottish – Campbell in fact is a surname found more widely in Jamaica than Scotland itself and we of course share the saltire style flags.\nThinking of heraldry I am so proud of my City, the city where I was born, and I think it is truly something special that we have a unicorn in our symbol – a unicorn, a serpant and the scales… I do intend to incorporate this into a hairdo at some point or an outfit somehow by the way both I and the office of Lord Mayor are open for sponsorship with Cllr Stevens already backing a few hairdos – i’m not sure if thats a problem or do I set the rules now as first citizen? The role doesn’t come with a manual just a load of anecdotes, conventions and very little budget! Clive which one next? Serpent unicorn or scales? I’m not sure yet how to show justice we will have to come back to that one, so let’s go for a medusa inspired style and I will try to turn anyone to stone who doesn’t obey the traffic lights. You see my other role is to Chair Full Council, and councillors must limit their speeches to 3 mins although today it’s 2 mins…\nThe heraldry or the symbols of Bristol which date to 1569. The significance of these various items is recorded in the City Audit Books of this time:- and I quote, the Unicorns will only do homage to men of virtue; (shrugs) the arms in the crest signify that good government depends on wisdom (the serpent) and justice (the scales) and that these are divine gifts from above.\nMany are called but few are chosen – I realise that I have been chosen and whist this may for some be timely I would suggest that its actually later than we think so in the song words of Gaetano Alberto “Guy” Lombardo and his Royal Canadians we had better enjoy ourselves.\nJoking aside, part of the role is a diplomatic duty and is this is also something I look forward to – welcoming various delegates to Bristol and continuing to some of our international partnerships with places such as Bordeaux and start to build new ones that perhaps resonate with some of our historic ties. As I alluded to – twining relies heavily on vested communities taking an active role in pulling things together so I have every faith that many of the people here today will support the over due call to link and one day twin cities in Bristol with Jamaica.\nCloser to home I will enjoy connecting across Bristol with various communities learning new things and seeing new places – I will also span the breadth of the city and will be connecting in a meaningful way organically and inclusively across all walks of society – from Filwood community centre, care homes, schools, to Merchants Hall and beyond – I believe that I can be a bridge and a major asset to the city. I look forward to working with new groups in new ways, including via one of my passions – dance. It is my intention to invite dance artists and guests to lead a few moves in future full council meetings – so with respect I think its only right that I address and recognise perhaps the most experienced Lord Mayor in our midst, none other than former LM Cllr Peter Abrahams who has served three times – Cllr Abrahams I have one question for you – how is your cha cha cha?! I know Cllr Hance is into flamenco and going back to my roots i’m imagining a mosh pit of politicians and I’m scouring the crowd not looking for any ravers but rather …. a line dancer…. come on, get on board for Strictly come dancing Full Council, we could try and literally sweat our assets and encourage more views on webcast, a text donation line maybe…. We must find times to have fun and I will be sure to have a fun year. I honestly believe that Bristol can be a beacon and lead the way on how we can co exist together and be part of the collective narrative. So you have heard a little more about me your Lord Mayor for the year, I can’t promise to take the title from my maternal grandmother as the sweetest voice of the West when chairing full council but I pledge to be firm and fair. I welcome the public gallery of citizens: posing questions, making statements, seeking clarity, providing insights and holding this council to account. But I do believe in order and progress. Let’s channel together the notion of good governance through our founding principles of wisdom and justice, and then maybe for me it would indeed be mighty fine if we may think of our cousin island of Jamaica: firstly, as a cousin, and secondly, in doing so be inspired by and heed their motto that out of many we can be one Bristol, then and only then the spirit of the unicorn may be bestowed upon us and then I know the true magic will happen.",
  "https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_/https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_as-labour-play-catchup-greens-are-surging-ahead/content_628.html": "menu\nBristol’s Green MEP, Molly Scott Cato, who is also an economist and the Green Party’s Economics Spokesperson, has responded to Labour’s new policy of a £10 minimum wage (a policy that the Green Party has been championing for years), by telling the Independent that:\n“I am pleased that the Green Party 2015 manifesto is forming the basis of Labour’s policy review. But as Labour play catch-up, Greens are surging ahead and now exploring whether we need an even higher minimum wage, which for Greens must be linked to a living wage.\nThe Living Wage Foundation has calculated a wage that is enough to live on is already £9.75 per hour for London, so it is likely we will need to be even more ambitious.”\nShe continued:\n“I look forward to the next exciting Labour policy announcement. Perhaps making the highest wage in any organisation no more than ten times the lowest wage, to help address the horrendous levels of inequality? They can find that on page 46 of our 2015 manifesto.\nI also want to see the Government reconsider its bogus National Living Wage which, with a shamefully low rate of £7.20 an hour, is clearly far short of what people really need to survive.\nIf we are going to keep up with the rapidly changing world of work and provide people with the security they need then we need to seriously consider bold new policies. We should be investigating the case for a basic income, a non means tested payment to all citizens, to give workers a real safety net and reward unpaid work.”",
  "https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_/https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_trans-rights-july-2020/content_194.html": "menu\nThis Saturday 18th July there will be a socially distanced demonstration on College Green in Bristol, with several hundred protesters expected, including local Green Party politicians.\nThe event was called in response to a Government statement about their plans for reform of the Gender Recognition Act (GRA).\nGreen Party campaigner Jenny Bartle (pictured), who is nonbinary, reveals why they will be attending the protest:\n“I am taking part in this weekend’s protest because I am afraid that the Government will introduce harmful changes to the GRA, and more broadly may roll back trans rights.\n“We need to apply pressure to them at this crucial stage, before the final decision on GRA reform is announced.\n“It remains a fact of life that modern Britain is not welcoming to trans people, and does not afford us our human rights. In such an environment, protest is our only option.”\nCurrently, a trans person must spend two years living in their self-identified gender before they may legally change their sex. Following this period, evidence must be provided to a committee which makes the decision about this person’s life. This is a lengthy, risky, and disempowering process, which costs several hundred pounds.\nIn 2018 the Government consulted on proposed changes to the Gender Recognition Act which could have addressed these challenges faced by the trans community.\nJenny adds,\n“The Government statement says that the “current checks and balances” (which likely refers to the unnecessary committee approval), are to be preserved. I believe this is the wrong decision. We can see other countries like Norway, which consistently leads the world in women’s rights, have updated laws to protect the human rights of trans people, and that is what we need in the UK.”\nAccess to healthcare is another major problem the trans community faces. Bristol’s nearest Gender Identity Clinic has a 4-year waiting list for a first appointment. Many trans and non-binary people find the requirement to be “diagnosed” by a doctor a harmful part of the journey to accessing transition.\nA leaked copy of Government plans shows that transgender women may not be permitted to use women’s toilet facilities unless they have had surgery. This would leave certain trans women unable to use any public toilets at all.\nGreen Party councillor and MP candidate Carla Denyer also backs the protest:\n“The threatened roll-back of basic human rights for trans and nonbinary people is scary. The discussion has been framed as the protection of single-sex spaces, which is extremely important for protecting women’s rights. But speaking personally and as a woman I strongly refute the implication that women’s rights and trans rights are somehow in conflict. In fact, as has been shown in countries like Norway and Sweden, in reality they are not just compatible but complementary.\n“As a Green Party member I am proud that our policy unequivocally supports trans rights. I will keep doing all I can to speak up for LGBTIQA+ people, not least because of the discrimination, abuse and hatred that many face in their daily lives.”\nNotes:\nMore details of protest available from Facebook event: https://www.facebook.com/events/3222372491117681/\nA guide on sexuality and gender terminology: https://www.stonewall.org.uk/help-advice/faqs-and-glossary/glossary-terms",
  "https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_/https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_school-climate-strike-childrens-brave-stand-has-our-support/content_306.html": "menu\nIn a letter in today’s Guardian, Bristol’s Green MEP is joined by 223 other academics from across the country, including many from Bristol University, writing to stand in solidarity with the children going on school climate strike on 15 February, and with all those taking a stand for the future of the planet.\nThe full letter reads:\nWe, the undersigned academics, stand in solidarity with the children going on school climate strike on 15 February, and with all those taking a stand for the future of the planet.\nNelson Mandela once said: “Our children are our greatest treasure. They are our future. Those who abuse them tear at the fabric of our society and weaken our nation.” Human planetary abuse is, in a very real sense, child neglect.\nAs many of us and other fellow academics have indicated previously in this newspaper (Letters, 27 October 2018), the scientific evidence of climate change is clear. For example, the summer of 2018 has been confirmed by the Meteorological Office as the hottest on record for England. The heatwave adversely affected crops across Europe, with wheat and potato harvests reduced by one quarter, which in turn impacted upon food prices. Australia is similarly experiencing “hottest on record” weather events. As citizens across the globe will know and testify, many comparably disturbing examples could be given. We cannot nurture our children without Nature.\nWe are rapidly losing sea ice in the Arctic. The warming of the ocean, the melting of land ice and the ensuing rising sea levels will threaten coasts. In 2018, the European Drought Observatory noted a high deficit in soil moisture across Scotland, Ireland and much of northern Europe. This increases the risk of wildfires, such as those we saw across England in 2018. As well as posing a direct threat to life, fires produce toxic smoke, which is a significant health risk to young and old alike. Sir David Attenborough has warned: “If we don’t take action, the collapse of our civilisations and the extinction of much of the natural world is on the horizon.” Many other organisations, like Extinction Rebellion, are now working to bring the truth about the ecological crisis to the public’s attention.\nIt is with these tragic and desperate events in mind that we offer our full support to the students – some of whom may well aspire to be the academics of the future – who bravely plan to strike on 15 February to demand that the UK government takes climate action. They have every right to be angry about the future that we shall bequeath to them, if proportionate and urgent action is not taken. We are inspired that our children, spurred on by the noble actions of Greta Thunberg and many other striking students all around the world, are making their voices heard.\nMolly Scott CatoAlison Green, PhD (Psychology), National Director (UK) ScientistsWarning.org\nSir Tim Smit Co-Founder, Eden Project & Exec Chair Eden Project International\nProfessor Kevin Anderson, Joint chair of Energy and Climate Change at Manchester and Uppsala Universities\nProfessor Tony Watts OBE\nChris Rapley CBE, Professor of Climate Science, UCL\nProfessor T.

We urge anyone with information to come forward to help Avon and Somerset police in their investigation, and we thank them for their hard work in bringing closure to the families as soon as possible.”\nResponding to the tragic news, Cllr Mohamed Makawi, said, “I and the rest of the Green Party remain steadfast in our efforts to advocate for increased support and funding to tackle knife crime. This heartbreaking news demonstrates that there is still so much to be done.”\nThis issue is close to Cllr Makawi’s heart, having lost a friend to knife crime in Castle Park last year. Following this, Cllr Makawi brought a motion to Bristol City Council calling for more to be done to tackle the root causes of knife crime. The motion was voted through with overwhelming support from councillors.\nHe continued, “We would like to expand the presence of bleed kits and training on their usage into various venues and neighbourhoods across the city. We pledge to work closely with both the police and communities, providing the essential platform and tools needed to enhance safety on our streets.”\nAni Stafford-Townsend is the Green Councillor for Central Ward, which contains some areas of concern for knife violence. Responding to the news, they said, “This tragedy demonstrates that there is still much more to be done to protect our young people from the causes and horrific impacts of knife crime including renewed youth provision in areas at risk. ”\n“My heart goes out to all those affected by this incident, and to anyone whose life has been impacted by knife crime.”\nNotes:\nGreen motion calls for action on causes of knife crime – Bristol Green Party",

  "https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_/https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_greens-offer-solutions-to-the-poverty-that-lies-behind-growth-figures/content_1003.html": "menu\n‘Return to growth’ headlines mask the reality of the grinding poverty experienced by many in our region, say South West Greens. They are proposing a three-point solution to low incomes and the cost of living: a living wage to replace the minimum wage, the abolition of zero hours contracts and the introduction of a Citizens’ Income.\nThe Green Party says that two recent independent studies reveal just how hollow economic growth figures are as an indicator of people’s wellbeing. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation reported that the South West has suffered particularly badly over the past few years with a dramatic increase in the proportion of households on very low incomes [1]. The Institute of Fiscal Studies reported that average living standards have fallen dramatically since the recession, with income failing to keep pace with the rate of inflation. They say household income in 2013 – 4 is more than 6% below its pre-recession peak, driven down by declines in real earnings, increases in the cost of living and cuts in benefits and tax credits over the last few years. They also suggest real earnings won’t return to their 2009 – 10 levels until at least 2018 and warn that further cuts to benefits and tax credits will put further downward pressure on incomes, particularly for low – income households.\nThe Green Party argues that three key policy initiatives would boost income and prevent people falling into the poverty trap. They say that the minimum wage should become a living wage, currently set at £7.65 in the South West, and that zero-hours contracts, with their unpredictable hours and earnings, should be abolished.\nThey are also calling for the implementation of the long held Green Party policy of a Citizens’ Income. This is an unconditional income payable to everyone and sufficient to cover basic needs. A Citizens’ Income would replace tax-free allowances and most social security benefits and would not be subject to means testing. Greens argue that a Citizens’ Income would eliminate the unemployment and poverty traps, as well as acting as a safety net to enable people to choose their own types and patterns of work. A petition calling for a Europe-wide Citizens’ Income (or Unconditional Basic Income) has received over 280,000 signatures [4].\nDr Molly Scott Cato, Green Party speaker on finance and lead European candidate in the South West said:\n“It has been clear that the phrase “we are all in this together” is nothing more than empty political rhetoric. If the Chancellor really wants to tackle poverty he should rise to the challenge set by the Greens and increase the minimum wage to a living wage. And he might also tell his embattled Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith that a Citizens Income would be far less of an administrative headache than Universal Credit. We all have a right to a share of the national wealth and paying a Citizens’ Income to every person in the country would end the divisive arguments about who deserves welfare payments.”\nNotes\n[1] HOUSEHOLDS BELOW A MINIMUM INCOME STANDARD: 2008/9 TO 2011/12 http://www.jrf.org.uk/sites/files/jrf/household-income-standards-full_0.pdf\n[2] The Squeeze on incomes, The Institute of Fiscal Studies http://www.ifs.org.uk/budgets/gb2014/gb2014_ch6.pdf\n[3] Further details on Green Party tax and Citizens’ Income policies http://policy.greenparty.org.uk/ec#Direct\n[4] European Citizens’ Initiative for an Unconditional Basic Income http://basicincome2013.eu/en/index.html",

Councillor Hance, who served as Green Cabinet Member for Waste and Energy up to November 2017, said bin delays were caused by the administration wasting time last year by failing to come to a decision over waste collection options.\nCllr Hance said:\n“Back when I was in Cabinet in September 2017 I told them that we needed to decide how we collected waste as soon as possible. We’d paid good money to a consultancy to come up with a number of options. However it seems this fell on deaf ears. A few months later Labour broke their commitment to a ‘rainbow cabinet’ by throwing out the Green, Lib Dem and Conservative cabinet members, and proceeded to waste months of valuable time dithering over new approaches to waste collection, all of which they eventually rejected in favour of doing nothing.”\n“All this inaction by the Labour administration has delayed essential upgrading of the recycling vehicle fleet to the point where we now see old vehicles forced off the road and thousands of residents impacted by bin collection delays. Slipping up on providing basic services like this is bad enough, but it’s frustrating that we don’t even have any new waste collection policies to show for all the lost time and money.”\nAs of 1 March these issues continued to impact collection times.",

Unlike most of the motions which come to meetings under an elected Mayor system, this specific motion is legally binding and the Council will now move to hold a referendum in May 2022 and put the choice of Mayoral or Committee system to Bristol’s public.\nNearly all Green Councillors supported the Lib Dem motion as they support the public having their say on the future of the Mayoral system and overall favour a committee system as the most democratic of the two alternative options. Under a committee system, decisions are made by committees made up of a proportional mix of councillors – so each party’s share of council seats determines their influence in council decisions. In the current system the elected Mayor holds all executive power and only those councillors chosen by the Mayor to be in their cabinet have a direct role in policy-making.\nBriefly abolished for most councils by the 2000 Local Govt Act, committee systems were restored as an option by the 2011 Localism Act. In the years since a growing number of councils have moved to a committee system – this year Sheffield decided to adopt the system following a successful local referendum.\nSpeaking in favour of the motion and seconding it, Councillor Guy Poultney said:\n“As Greens, we support giving people a voice in the decisions that affect their city and their lives. Imagine if this council’s policies were motivated by the desire to fix the issues we see every day in our communities.\nThe Green Councillor described the motion being discussed as “not a return to the past, but something more radical. Not a return to leader and cabinet (which would still be preferable to a Mayor), but a committee system that rewards consensus – councillors working together with each other to champion the communities they represent: enhancing democracy and delivering real scrutiny. A system that empowers people – that brings the voices of every neighbourhood and every community of our city into the policy-making process.”\nCouncillor Mohamed Makawi also spoke to support the committee system, noting that Committee system is Green party policy. He said:\n“The Green Party believes that local authorities run by directly elected mayors, are not in the best interests of local democracy. They take decision making powers away from councillors as a whole and place them in the hands of a few individuals, even just one person, leading to the disenfranchisement of those councillors who are not in the ruling party and the citizens they represent.\nHe added:\n“However, we do agree with democracy and if the people of Bristol want an elected Mayor, we will field a candidate who will positively rise to that challenge and bring more positive Green policies and participation options like the citizens assemblies we initiated last year.”\nThe motion was passed with 41 votes in favour and 21 against.\nSpeaking after the meeting, the Green Group’s leader, Heather Mack, addressed the Labour group’s hostility to the motion. She said:\n“I am disappointed that after Labour councillors wanted to propose an amendment for a leader and cabinet system, a system preferred by many Labour councillors, and local MP’s over the mayoral system, that Steve Pearce dismissed the debate on how we run a city as ‘belly button fluff’. It’s an insult to his colleagues in the chamber, and to all the people who want a better democracy for the city – and it’s concerning that Labour councillors are suggesting they wouldn’t be capable of working cross party for the good of Bristol as part of a committee system.”\nCouncillor Guy Poultney said:\n“The people of Bristol have had ten years to see the reality of the Mayoral system. This vote gives us all an opportunity to reject the Mayoral system and stand for democracy, transparency and scrutiny – I look forward to the city having the debate”\nCllr Heather Mack is the Deputy Leader of Bristol City Council\nMore about Heather",

She said:\n“Greens in the European Parliament will fight hard against any moves to remove the freedom for countries to choose which way they want to run their passenger rail services. For Greens in the UK that means, unequivocally, public ownership of our railways.”\nDr Scott Cato has an ongoing petition on the government’s e-petitions site calling for the railways to be brought back into public ownership [3].\nThe Green Party is still the only major party that endorses returning the railways to public ownership, as each privatised franchise expires.

On Friday 15th February, school children from across Bristol will be taking part in the first nationwide ‘Youth Strike 4 Climate’ inspired by the actions of 16 year old Greta Thunberg in Sweden. This Friday, many of Bristol’s schoolchildren will be joining the 70,000 schoolchildren from 270 cities and towns across the world who have been taking part in ‘Fridays for Future’ demanding that politicians take action to confront the climate emergency.\nA Green motion passed by the Council in November led to Bristol declaring a climate emergency and becoming the first UK core city to pledge to become carbon neutral by 2030. This followed the latest IPCC report which made it clear that we have just 12 years left to limit global warming to a rise of only 1.5 beyond which catastrophic climate change impacts are inevitable.\nGreen Group Leader, Eleanor Combley said:\n“This action is a credit to Bristol’s schoolchildren. While so many of our politicians and leaders are hiding their heads in the sand our young people know that we are in a climate emergency and we must take action now. We have just 12 years to avoid catastrophic climate change, and the terrible impacts that will have on our children and grandchildren. Adults are failing future generations and this must change.”\n“As a parent myself I know that it can be hard to condone rule-breaking in our children and young people, but there are times when their voices must be heard. According to the Department of Education, children are only authorised to take days off for ‘exceptional circumstances’. With a climate emergency declared in Bristol and just 12 years to cut CO2 emissions by 50% I stand by all those parents and teachers who believe these are ‘exceptional circumstances’ and are supporting pupils to take this action.”\n“I have also written to the Mayor of Bristol asking him to support Friday’s strike and help headteachers and parents in providing the safeguarding needed to enable young people who want to join the strike to do so safely. If we want our children and young people to be active citizens and participate in the political process, we cannot then dole out punitive punishments when they voice legitimate concerns about climate change.”\nThe NAHT head teachers union has also voiced support for the strike, with a spokesperson saying:\n“Society makes leaps forward when people are prepared to take action. Schools encourage students to develop a wider understanding of the world around them. A day of activity like this could be an important and valuable life experience.”\nNotes",

Green councillors said that it is now inevitable that congestion and air pollution in Bristol will become even worse than before lockdown as people begin to return to work but use of public transport is much lower due to social distancing and fear of coronavirus.\nCouncillors said that peaceful protest action was entirely justified after four years of the Mayor failing to implement a Clean Air Zone.

It’s now nearly 4 years since the Council passed a Green motion calling for a Clean Air Zone and yet despite the Council spending millions of pounds on consultants, Bristol is no closer to clean, breathable air. After four years of failure from Marvin Rees to act on clean air, I fully support protestors taking peaceful socially-distanced action to voice their frustration at the city’s continuing illegal and unsafe air quality and call on the Mayor to speak with the protestors to explain just how he intends to clean up Bristol’s air, with the urgency that is needed.”\nCouncillor Eleanor Combley added:\n“Streets should be the centre of our communities where children can play, people can sit outside their doors and open their windows without being scared to breathe the dirty air. Wherever we live in Bristol, clean air is a right, not a luxury. We can build a city where we can all breathe legal, clean air but to do so we need immediate action – further delays are completely unacceptable.”\nSandy Hore-Ruthven, Bristol Green Party’s mayoral candidate, says\n“The Mayor has a golden opportunity to deliver a fairer and greener future by taking action on air quality. Implementing a clean air zone that applies to all polluting diesel vehicles would improve the quality of life for some of the must vulnerable families living in pollution hotspots, and reduce harmful pollution more generally across the city.

By failing to act swiftly, he has allowed the seed crop for this spring to be impregnated with pesticides linked to the weakening of bee colonies, thus prolonging the harm being done. This is beginning to look like negligence.”\nToday, the Wales Green Party wrote a strongly worded letter on behalf of petitioners and bee-keepers to David Jones MP, Secretary of State for Wales asking that he urgently carries out his duty under provision of the 1980 Bees Act to protect bees, as well as ensure the UK does not fall foul of European law.\nPippa Bartolotti said, “There are more than 40,000 concerned people who urgently need to know what the position of the Secretary of State is on this matter, for the sake of bees and other pollinators, Ministers should have no qualms in making bee survival their top priority. We do not understand why the Minister is dragging his feet.\n“The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Secretary of State for Wales, are responsible for ensuring bees are not at risk from insecticides. The law requires that insecticides are robustly tested prior to authorisation being granted, and where risk assessment has not been finalised, we believe products should be immediately withdrawn from the market.”\nResearch at the University of Sterling found that colonies of Buff-tailed bumblebees exposed to the neonicotinoid Imidacloprid, produced 85% fewer queens than control colonies(4). The success and survival of new bumblebee queens is essential to ensure the viability of future bumblebee populations.\nPesticide risk assessment requires tests on very few species including the honey bee, which are meant to be representative for invertebrates as a whole(5). Neonicotinoids are systemic insecticides that permeate the whole plant, and residues of some neonicointoids may remain in the soil for at least 2 years(6).\nLast year, EFSA, the European Food Standards Agency, had identified significant flaws in regulatory risk assessment guidelines for testing pesticides on honey bees, and highlighted a need for consideration of wild bees within the regulatory system(2). Upon further investigation of three neonicotinoids, EFSA scientists identified areas of high risk to bees from flowering crops, as well as a number of data gaps that would have to be filled to allow further evaluation of the potential risks to bees from clothianidin, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam(3).\nOn Thursday 21st February, Pippa Bartolotti, Leader of the Wales Green Party handed in a petition of 40,440 signatures to John Griffiths, Minister for Environment and Sustainable Development, asking him to outlaw the use and sale of neonicotinoid insecticides in Wales.\nENDS\nFurther information:\nEU Regulation 1107/2009 (Annex II, 3.8.3.) states: “An active substance, safener or synergist shall be approved only if it is established following an appropriate risk assessment on the basis of Community or internationally agreed test guidelines, that the use under the proposed conditions of use of plant protection products containing this active substance, safener or synergist: will result in a negligible exposure of honey bees, or has no unacceptable acute or chronic effects on colony survival and development, taking into account effects on honey bee larvae and honey bee behaviour.”\n(1) EFSA: Bee health http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/topics/topic/beehealth.htm\n(2) Scientific Opinion on the science behind the development of a risk assessment of Plant Protection Products on bees (Apis mellifera, Bombus spp. and solitary bees) http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/2668.htm\n(3) EFSA identifies risks to bees from neonicotinoids http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/130116.htm?utm_source=homepage&utm_medium=infocus&utm_campaign=beehealth\n(4) Neonicotinoid Pesticide Reduces Bumble Bee Colony Growth and Queen Production – Whitehorn et al, Science 20 April 2012: 351-352.Publ: 29 March 2012 [DOI:10.1126/science.1215025]\n(5) Chemicals Regulation Directorate “DATA REQUIREMENTS HANDBOOK”- Version 2.2, June 2012\n(6) “Behaviour of Imidacloprid in Fields.Toxicity for Honey Bees”; Bonmatin et al.\nPippa Bartolotti is the Leader of the Wales Green Party Mob 07981717757 Tel 01633 822922 or pippabartolotti@walesgreenparty.com\nFor more information about the Green Party’s food and agriculture policies, visit: http://policy.greenparty.org.uk/fa",

The latest official estimate saw rough sleeping numbers rise for the seventh consecutive year. Responding to the increase in Bristol, leader of the Green Group Councillor Eleanor Combley said:\n“Given the priority the Mayor gave to homelessness with his City Office, it is very disappointing that rough sleeping has increased so much – in Bristol by 16%, more than the average for England (including London). To give credit where it’s due, the Labour administration have introduced some good initiatives, for example opening up more disused council buildings for the homeless (a policy which began under the previous Mayor after a Green council motion).\n“Yet it doesn’t help that the Mayor also made deep cuts to the Local Crisis Prevention Fund last year, voting down a Green budget amendment to protect it. This fund is a crucial last resort for people in the city in moments of extreme crisis, including those at risk of eviction, and this year the proportion of those refused access to funding more than doubled – almost 50% of applicants were turned away.\n“This country’s broken economic system, decades of cuts to services, a cost of living crisis and increased workplace insecurity are responsible for breathtaking rates of poverty for those in and out of work, and have led to millions living just a paycheck away from eviction and homelessness.

Yesterday Green councillors warned that the plans may even be illegal after a legal precedent set by the High Court’s decision to reject a third runway at Heathrow. North Somerset council had pledged to amend plans before they were approved at the regional authority but Bristol’s Labour cabinet ignored calls from activists to do the same.\nGreen Councillor Steve Clarke chairs WECA’s Overview and Scrutiny committee, which on January 31 called for the authority to reassess major schemes in the light of the Climate Emergency. Before the meeting he warned of the legal risk, saying:\n“The decision by high court judges to rule out Heathrow’s planned third runway has set a legal precedent – the ‘Paris Agreement’ on climate change that the UK signed up to in 2016 must be taken into account in major infrastructure decisions. Therefore the Joint Local Transport Plan, which is coming before Cabinet this evening, may now be illegal if it is not amended or updated before being approved. This is because it contains major road building provisions but it does not appear to have taken into account the legally binding provisions of the Paris Agreement.”\nDuring the meeting Labour’s transport lead Kye Dudd acknowledged the concerns of campaigners, suggesting the plan would be “reviewed straight away” after it had been approved by the West of England Combined Authority (WECA). However he did not provide further information as to what that review would target or when it might take place. Once approved the plan will have statutory force and reviewing or changing it would be a lengthy and complicated process.\nReferring to the Heathrow decision, an Extinction Rebellion (XR) representative in the public gallery stated that XR “reserves the right to call a judicial review” on the plans if they proceed, threatening legal action under the precedent set by the Heathrow decision.\nLabour’s former Transport lead Cllr Mhairi Threlfall agreed with Greens and other opponents to the plan. She said that as a document the JLTP was “a little bit meaningless” and that once approved it would be a statutory document – her recommendation was to strip out the problems in the document before it was agreed.\nGreen Councillor Carla Denyer had lobbied the Mayor to amend the plan two weeks before the meeting. At Cabinet she asked the Cabinet Transport lead to commit to scrap climate-damaging road projects in the plan before approving it but did not receive a direct answer. Responding to the outcome outside the meeting, Councillor Denyer said:\n“Just last week the Mayor tweeted his support for Greta Thunberg – but today his cabinet refused to commit to removing new road building from the regional plan. Cabinet member Kye Dudd’s comments initially seemed positive, saying that Bristol City Council would push for a review of the plan in light of the Climate Emergency. However, when I asked if he would explicitly commit to scrap the road building and widening plans in the Joint Local Transport Plan before it is approved by WECA on 20th March, he declined to answer. When pressed, he tried to deflect the question by pointing out that the new roads planned are outside the Bristol City Council area. This is true, but beside the point.\nBristol’s Mayor has substantial power, as one of the four members of WECA, to make the decision on the JLTP for the whole region. When WECA declared a climate emergency last July, Marvin Rees said that it must focus on the “less glamorous” details of how the region’s carbon emissions could be reduced – this report is the perfect example of that. But Mayor Rees and his Cabinet have chosen to stick with business as usual instead of using their power to tackle the Climate Emergency – not just for Bristol but the whole of the West of England.\nThe plans noted at Cabinet this evening will increase congestion on local roads, increase carbon emissions, and may even be illegal as they’re out of step with the UK’s Climate Commitments. In good faith, I emailed Marvin Rees last month about the report, ahead of cabinet deadlines, so that he would be best able to prepare for it. No amount of spin or PR from the Mayor can hide the gap between his words and his cabinet’s actions on climate change.”",

For thirty years, British governments have looked to the market to solve our problems, but things have only become worse.\n“The Government have acknowledged that our housing market is broken, but they have failed to make the necessary break with the failed policies of the past. While they throw billions into subsidies that drive up prices they continue to sell-off and demolish social housing for rent. All the while, the number of homeless continues to grow.\n“What is needed is a radical overhaul. We need a housing policy that stabilises prices and invests in social housing; one that protects renters and controls their rents, and helps small and community-led builders provide high quality and affordable homes that local communities will support.\n“We should be inspired by our European neighbours. The Government could equalise tax rates and make subsidies less generous to stabilise house prices, learning from policies in Ireland and Sweden; it could give tenants more protection against rent increases and evictions, learning from experiences of rent controls in Spain, Italy and Germany and it could support community-led housing and planning approaches, learning from the Netherlands.\n“We need a vision that is both radical and realistic. Examples from Europe show this is achievable and that we can and we must fix our broken housing market.”",

She says that their continued support for the new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point, and opposition by Tory MPs to both on and offshore wind, represents a huge missed economic opportunity for the South West and higher energy prices for businesses and consumers.\nThe challenge comes as the price of offshore wind power falls dramatically below the cost of generating electricity from Hinkley. The results of a government auction on Monday for subsidy contracts reveal two offshore wind farms will be built producing electricity for just £57.50 per MWh, compared with the £92.50 per MWh guaranteed for Hinkley’s nuclear power. Molly said:\n“Now that the cost of offshore wind is so much cheaper than nuclear, it is time for Conservative and Labour MPs from across the South West region to unite against Hinkley and back renewables. Businesses and consumers are set to pay a 60% price premium on Hinkley relative to the cost of offshore wind so you have to be economically illiterate to continue supporting new nuclear power stations.\n“For the South West there are huge economic opportunities to be had from our rich mix of available renewable energy resources, and chief amongst these is off-shore wind.\n“Yet looking at the auctions for new government energy subsidies for offshore wind, released this morning, nobody has applied for a subsidy to build offshore wind in the South West. Why would they when they know that our region is stalked by Tory dinosaurs who will fight their planning proposals; destroying economic opportunities for local people, pushing up their energy bills, and denying us the clean energy future we deserve?\n“It’s time for the region’s Tory MPs to end their ideological pro nuclear, anti-renewables obsession and get behind previously shelved offshore wind schemes; ditched partly due to dogmatic opposition to wind power. The Navitus off-shore wind development in Dorset could have secured enough energy to power 700,000 homes, while the Atlantic Array off the North Devon coast was forecast to power 900,000 homes.\n“There are also thousands of jobs to be created in the renewables sector; many more than can ever be created from nuclear. Not only through operating and servicing renewable energy plants but also through manufacturing of components to support the renewables sector. Already we see more than £1 million worth of exports of micro windmills manufactured in Stroud by Ecotricity. Meanwhile, in Hull, Siemens has invested £310 million in wind turbine production and installation facilities, creating over 1000 jobs.\n“Now is the time to usher in a new green industrial revolution in the South West, and time our MPs backed this, rather than remaining wedded to the dangerous and expensive technologies of the past.”",

  "https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_/https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_letter-to-government-to-save-channel-4-signed-by-green-co-leader/content_172.html": "menu\nHaving recently opened their new Creative Hub in Bristol, Channel 4 is facing threats of privatisation from the government. In response to the proposed changes, an open letter is being sent to Nadine Dorries, Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport.\nThe letter, from We Own It, is signed by advocates from across all sectors, reiterating the case for Channel 4’s unique model as a publicly owned but commercially funded broadcaster. The signatories include Co-Leader of the Green Party and Bristol City Councillor Carla Denyer.\nHere is the letter in full:\nOn the 14th of September 2021 your department closed its consultation calling for views and evidence into a potential change of ownership of the Channel 4 television corporation. News outlets reported that a substantial 60,000 responses were submitted and understandably the department for DCMS needed time to review those responses. We welcome this time for consideration and recognition of the gravity of this decision. However, workers in the industry as well as the viewing public need a clear commitment about the future of Channel 4 and an end to the uncertainty over industry jobs in our nations and regions.\nWe, as the signatories below, are reiterating the case for Channel 4’s unique model as a publicly owned but commercially funded broadcaster, at no cost to the taxpayer, to be retained into the future. A position supported by 82% of the viewing public in a Tapestry poll.\nWe draw attention to evidence that Channel 4 is performing above and beyond expectations in a changing media landscape and is projected to do so into the future.\nWe believe that a change in the ownership model of Channel 4 poses a significant risk to jobs and small businesses in the nations and regions outside London and as a result directly contradicts any commitment this government has made to levelling up across the UK.\nWe ask that as Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport you make a public commitment to retain Channel 4 in public ownership.\nChannel 4 is a Great British success story. It produces world-famous programmes and films such as Slumdog Millionaire, Father Ted, and The Great British Bake Off. It also makes a profit, boosts jobs and nurtures talent across the UK.\nIn 2021 Channel 4’s revenues hit £1 billion, a 19% growth from 2020. It reported a £74 million pre-tax surplus and net cash reserves of £201 million. A substantial portion of Channel 4’s growth has come from its digital revenues which are projected to rise by 32% each year, beyond its target to double digital viewers and make digital advertising 30% of all revenue. All this at no cost to the taxpayer and without Channel 4 requesting an increase on its borrowing limit.\nConsidering the above, the claim that Channel 4 privatisation will enable the broadcaster to better compete with online streaming providers does not hold weight. Channel 4 has always adopted an innovative and forward-facing approach to broadcasting. It was amongst the first broadcasters to establish an online streaming service in the UK and the significant growth of its digital revenues, above and beyond expectations, only demonstrates its ability to keep pace with a changing media landscape.\nPrivatisation will in fact create a financial burden for the Channel 4 Corporation as it will have to create value for shareholders rather than, as is currently the case, being free to invest its surplus revenues in innovative development strategies.\nErnst and Young’s reporting projects that privatisation risks a 35% drop in regional jobs dependent on Channel 4. In 2020, Channel 4 produced 58% of its content in the nations and regions outside London and has committed to spending 50% of its budget outside of the capital by 2023. This spending includes revenue for independent production companies in the nations and regions, which in 2019 received £189 million from Channel 4. In this sense the Channel 4 model plays a unique role in the UK’s broadcasting ecosystem working with more independent producers than any other broadcaster, with around 140 small businesses reliant on Channel 4 for more than half of their production revenue. This is particularly crucial to the existence of small businesses outside London, with as many as 60 production companies projected to be put at significant risk under a private ownership model.\nThis level of risk to jobs and small businesses in the regions and nations runs counter to the government’s commitment to levelling up across the UK. Channel 4’s headquarters in Leeds and its creative hubs in Glasgow and Bristol make significant contributions to local economies and should be retained under public ownership as strategic assets for the levelling up agenda.\nWe, as the signatories below, are asking as industry professionals, political representatives and as a voice of the viewing public that the government end the uncertainty around Channel 4. We ask that in consideration of Channel 4’s excellent performance and rapid growth in digital revenues you as Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport commit to safeguarding jobs and small businesses in the UK’s regions and nations and make a public commitment to retain Channel 4 under public ownership.\nCat Hobbs (Director – We Own It)\nDan Norris (West of England Combined Authority Mayor)\nTracy Brabin (West Yorkshire Combined Authority Mayor)\nFrances O’Grady (General Secretary – Trades Union Congress)\nMichelle Stanistreet (General Secretary – National Union of Journalists)\nPaul W.

Yesterday, having failed to deliver that surplus, he announced yet more cuts that he now claims will deliver a surplus by 2020.There is a tendency to see George Osborne as a man who repeatedly misses his targets – this is incorrect. Osborne has hit his target time after time because his targets are the poor and the vulnerable, the disabled and the young. And, of course, those green industries that offer the potential to secure a real low carbon energy future for our country without the need to rely on nuclear or shale gas.\nHaving promised billions in promises to the Chinese for nuclear, whilst failing to support the steel workers of the North East, yesterday he returned to his assault on those seeking to deliver truly low carbon energy with £700m of cuts to the Renewable Heat Initiative and the scrapping of the ECO scheme.\nHaving screamed of the urgency to reduce our debts and “live within our means”, yesterday he casually loaded even more debt on to the shoulders of students, especially those from deprived backgrounds, by freezing the student loan repayment threshold. The Chancellor did not even have the courage to include this punitive change in his speech, it appears in the small print.\nHaving talked up the need to deliver more homes, he slashed the New Homes Bonus that offers councils incentives to build whilst continuing to undermine efforts by councils to deliver homes that the majority of people can afford.\nThis is a Chancellor whose aim is not to protect those most in need of protection, it is to shrink the state and undermine our public services.\nThe Chancellor’s approach adds further urgency to the need for Bristol to recover greater control over its own revenue spending and capital investment opportunities, and the freedom to work with our local businesses and communities to deliver a better future for our city based on our own objectives and needs.”\n“The announcements made yesterday will have a profound effect on Bristol City Council, with additional cuts of 25% to an already shrunken budget.

Their land is currently a species rich hay meadow and has recently been designated as a Site of Nature Conservation Interest (SNCI). It is thought that damaging work was approved due to a series of mistakes from the council.\nThe Greens also believe that as the hay meadow already has a usable entrance, the requirement for a second entrance that requires the destruction of an ancient habitat is unnecessary.\nCllr Emma Edwards, Leader of the Green Group, who helped organise a show of cross party support for the hedgerow earlier this year said:\n“The destruction of this ancient hedgerow is a direct result of incompetence within the council and was sadly inevitable once it had failed to fulfil its duty to deal with the application by Newcombe Estates appropriately.”\n“There is a culture within the current administration that rails against transparency and openness. Ward councillors are frequently left out of the loop regarding decisions affecting their wards, and it is no surprise that this has permeated further down the organisation. Information that should be shared is withheld, leading to preventable mistakes.\n“I will be asking for a full report of the circumstances that have allowed this wholly preventable destruction to happen”.\nCllr Tony Dyer added; “We also need to look at the motivations of Newcombe Estates, and their relatively silent partners in this, the home developer Redrow. Newcombe Estates are clearly intent on seeing their part of the Yew Tree Farm SNCI developed for housing, causing irreparable harm and further erosion of the Green Belt.\n“This is despite the elected representatives of Bristol voting overwhelmingly not once, but twice, to remove Yew Tree Farm, including the land owned by Newcombe Estates, from consideration for development.”\nThe latest of these votes was only last week, when an Extraordinary Full Council overwhelmingly approved the submission of the new Local Plan to the Planning Inspectorate, which protects Yew Tree Farm from being developed on.\nCllr Dyer continued “Despite these democratic expressions of intent by Bristol City Council, as well as the designation of the new Yew Tree Farm Site of Nature Conservation Interest, it is clear that the landowners remain committed to their ambitions and have little or no concern for democratic process.”\nCllr Emma Edwards is the Leader of the Green Group on Bristol City Council\nMore about EmmaCllr Tony Dyer is the Leader of Bristol City Council\nMore about Tony",

Now thanks to the Greens’ amendment, the excellent way council officers and foster carers work together, and the collaborative approach taken by Family Services and Housing Departments, a first home has just been extended with a two-storey side extension and handed back to a foster family with extra rooms, and builders have started work on another property.”\nCouncillor Fodor went to visit the family. The Green councillor said he was “thrilled” to see how his budget amendment was helping people directly. He said:\n“It’s so rewarding to know my council house extension fund not only worked but is now helping people’s lives in an unexpected way, to provide a family life to some of the most vulnerable children and young people in the city. I feel like it’s one of the most direct ways I’ve made a difference to peoples lives since I became a councillor in 2014.”\n“I’m thrilled that this budget amendment is helping people so directly.”\nOne teenager in the family said:\n“After the extension has been built it feels more spacious and not overcrowded, and now we can all socialise in one place without getting in each others ways. We can all help around the kitchen as it is big enough for all of us to help out when needed”\nFoster parent Becky said that before the extension the family had limited space. She wrote that with the extension completed she would be able to care for another child and described the benefits to her family:\n“Downstairs has created a larger communal area for the family where independence can be encouraged with cooking in the kitchen; extra family space for the whole family to interact and all children can have friends around which is encouraged. The extra space has enabled us to have a homework station in the kitchen diner area so that I can help support homework whilst cooking.”\nShe added:\n“The living room is much larger. Since the extension has been completed we have, as a large family, come together a lot more… even though it is early days of completion we are seeing the vast advantages to us as a family this has created.”\nNotes\n1) Press release from February 2019 https://www.bristolgreenparty.org.uk/news/greens-present-budget-amendments-to-create-more-housing-and-save-money\n2) The amendment proposed by Councillor Fodor used underspent money ringfenced for use on council housing, which could not be allocated to other departments\n3) Image of Martin Fodor visiting the new extension",

Does the Mayor understand the critical importance of the UK sticking to its carbon emissions targets, to prevent abrupt and irreversible changes that will wreck livelihoods and make the economy the least of our worries, as we face more of the droughts, crop failures, disease and flooding that we are already seeing on all continents?\n2. In light of the recent analysis that has shown that airport expansion disproportionally benefits the richest 10% while harming us all through climate change, air pollution and noise pollution; and in light of the recently agreed expansion of Heathrow Airport, which puts the UK on a trajectory to miss its carbon emissions targets unless drastic actions are taken; will the Mayor reconsider his previous position of supporting the expansion of Bristol Airport?\nAnother Green councillor, Charlie Bolton, questioned the Mayor in January 2018, during an earlier consultation about airport expansion, highlighting how the increase in the airport’s capacity – which would see passenger numbers more than double from 8 million to 20 million – contradicts local and national climate targets. At the time he said,\n“I asked the Mayor about this at the last Full Council and in response he suggested he supports both meeting our climate targets and expanding the airport, which is quite frankly impossible to reconcile. Making encouraging sounds about climate commitments while blithely agreeing to more air travel is trying to have your cake and eat it. Much like Theresa May it seems the Mayor simply doesn’t want to face up to the unpleasant reality that our climate change targets are incompatible with further expanding airports and air travel in the UK.”\n“Political evasion on this issue isn’t helping anyone.”\nCouncillor Denyer has also submitted a motion to next week’s Full Council meeting, calling on the Mayor to use his influential position to hold the airport to account on its emissions, to ensure the region keeps its commitments. The Joint Spatial Plan – which includes North Somerset and the geographical area covered by the airport – contains an explicit commitment to making a 50% cut in emissions by 2036. But the airport has been accused of ‘greenwash’ for publicising a 2030 carbon neutral target with no plan in place, and which does not include the emissions from aeroplanes themselves.\nShe commented: “This is an equality issue as well as an environmental one. According to the Civil Aviation Authority’s passenger surveys, 47% of the UK population has flown in the last year, and this figure has been stable over the last 15 years. Most of those people only make one or two trips per year, while 10% of the population makes about 60% of all flights, and these people are mainly from the highest income groups. This means that airport expansion disproportionally benefits the wealthy but negatively affects us all through climate change, air pollution and noise pollution. So I cannot understand how a Labour Mayor can justify his position of backing airport expansion.”\nIn the recent vote in Parliament over the expansion of Heathrow, Bristol’s Labour MPs were divided, with two voting against, one voting for, and one not present.\nNotes:\n– Councillor Denyer’s exposé of the Airport’s misleading claims and lack of a plan for decarbonisation: https://bristolgreenparty.org.uk/news/bristol-airport-carbon-targets-worthless-without-roadmap-say-greens\n– Councillor Bolton’s question to Marvin Rees in January 2018, during the last round of the consultation, and the Mayor’s answer: https://bristolgreenparty.org.uk/news/greens-say-we-all-need-to-challenge-airport-expansion.

  "https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_/https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_keeping-bristols-parks-adfree/content_396.html": "menu\nAt a council meeting on March 20 Bristol Council debated a petition to ‘Keep our parks advertising free’. The petition was organised in response to the Labour administration’s proposals to introduce commercial advertising to Bristol’s parks and green spaces, and calls on the council to abandon these plans.\nOne month earlier at the council’s budget meeting in February, Green councillors had proposed a budget amendment that would have provided extra funding for the city’s parks in order to prevent the introduction of advertising, funded by scrapping the free parking which councillors and senior staff currently benefit from at City Hall. However the amendment was vigorously opposed by all three other parties in the Chamber and voted down by the Labour and Conservative groups.\nResponding to the outcome, Green Group Leader Eleanor Combley said:\n“To be honest, I struggle to see why this proposal is controversial. Our constitution is clear: the basic allowance for councillors should cover transport costs within Bristol, and we are not meant to receive any additional funding for transport. We seem to have no problem with following this rule when it comes to councillors who use public transport, so why are we going against our own constitution when it comes to councillors who drive?\n“It is rather depressing that Councillors value their free parking spaces over increased funding for the city’s parks, which could be used to alleviate threats to introduce advertising. Meanwhile, with no apparent sense of irony, the Labour administration prepares to increase parking charges for ordinary people across Bristol.”\nBelow is the text of the speech Green councillor for Southville Stephen Clarke made at the March 20 Council meeting, speaking in response to the petition:\nFull Council Speech by Cllr Stephen Clarke\n“First of all I would like to congratulate the organisers of this important petition (Robbie and Nicola and the others at Adblock Bristol) who I know are doing really important work around the issue of keeping Bristol liveable and helping to protecting our children from some of the pressures imposed by commerce on them.\nI suppose the truth is that no one in this chamber really wants advertising hoardings in our parks. The question is whether we are prepared to follow through on this belief or we think it is worth having them to get the cash. My view and the view of my fellow Green Group (and the view of the 5000 odd people who have signed this petition) is that it’s just not worth it.\nOne of the reasons I love Bristol (which is where I was born and where my children live) is that I am not constantly bombarded by intrusive commercial images; or at least not to the extent that I am in London or New York (or even Liverpool as evidenced by this picture) [image can be seen here].\nThe thought of brightly lit, large intrusive hoardings in parks trying to sell me goods I don’t want or need fills me with horror. I want (and demand) the freedom to choose when I am exposed to advertising. On ITV, yes; in newspapers and magazines, yes; in parks and public open spaces around the city, NO!\nThere are many reasons why this idea is disastrously wrong; some have already been mentioned by others but let’s just consider a few fundamental questions:\nFirstly; what are our parks for?\n– In essence; they are places for urban dwellers to stroll around and have a little taste of nature.\n– They are places for parents to bring their kids and allow them to run around with as few cares as possible.\n– They are places for our teenagers to chat to each other, exercise on bikes and skateboards and become the citizens of tomorrow.\nSecondly; why do the advertisers want to put up these billboards?\n– The only reason is obviously to sell us more ‘stuff’; stuff we often don’t need; stuff that pollutes our city with noxious fumes like 4x4s; stuff that won’t be making us happy anytime soon.\nHow do the advertisers do this?\n– Usually by attacking how we feel about ourselves; we are made to feel too fat, too old or too poor. Many studies have shown that this directly affects our mental health and leads to problems such as eating disorders, depression and poor self-image.\nAn even dafter thing to note is that often these advertising campaigns go directly against the aims of our own council initiatives; Sugar Smart for example or trying to help the air pollution situation. Where is the logic in fighting these ills in our town at great cost at the same time as selling opportunities (in our parks!) to accelerate them?\nA few other quick points:\n– I have a particular concern about digital advertising which I have no doubt will arrive hard on the heels of any billboards that are allowed. These are visual pollution on a huge scale: real ‘sky trash’. They use huge amounts of energy (the large ones have up to 10,000 LEDS and use the same energy as up to 30 residential homes) and are designed to use maximum distraction techniques (of course): quickly changing, brightly coloured visual images bombarding us with sales messages.\n– Is it possible to do anything about this issue? Well, we are not the first community to have thought about this; many others have. There is a long list of these forward thinking communities (up to 1400 worldwide at the last count) including all of Sweden, parts of New Zealand, Bergen in Norway, Hawaii and 700 other communities in the USA. All of these and many others have made a stand against billboards and digital advertising.\n– By the way; this is a social justice issue too; we might be getting adverts in Dame Emily Park in Ashton or Eastville Park but I don’t suppose we will be seeing them on the Downs any time soon…\nThe idea of putting advertising in parks is really a crazy one and I really challenge anyone of whatever political persuasion to look in their heart and say it is a good one. To paraphrase the Nike slogan; Just don’t do it!”\nBackground:",

Writing to David Davis MP, the Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, she calls for him to make public the results of any studies carried out by the government.\nThe call comes as leaked documents from a Department of Health study this week reveal that under a hard Brexit scenario – of leaving the single market and customs union and ending freedom of movement – the NHS could be short of 40,000 nurses by 2026. In the letter, Dr Scott Cato asks Mr Davis to make public their scenario planning in areas including the economic impacts of leaving the single market; of ending freedom of movement; and of reducing environmental regulations. She also asks if there have been any studies on the impacts on farmers and rural communities that she represents in the South West. Dr Scott Cato said:\n“People have a right to know and want to know about the government’s plans post-Brexit and the potential impacts of these plans. The slogan ‘take back control’ is still ringing in our ears. This requires nothing less than full transparency and decisions made by our elected representatives, not hidden documents and legislation by a secret cabal. Now more than ever, we need confidence in our long-term planning and this can only be achieved through open, transparent decision-making.\n“If we face a future where we cannot staff our hospitals and care homes; where crops are left to rot in fields because there is no one to harvest them, we deserve to know as a matter of urgency.\n“This failure to disclose the results of impact studies reveals a government running scared of its own extreme form of Brexit. Either that, or having successfully engineered a power grab, the Tory right is keeping the dire consequences of leaving the EU under wraps, in case people themselves, armed with that knowledge, demand to take back control of the Brexit process.\n“It is because of the lack of transparency over Brexit and uncertainty of what lies ahead that Greens are calling for a ratification referendum at the end of the Article 50 process: a chance to vote on the deal agreed between the UK and the EU”.",
  "https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_/https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_green-councillors-question-financial-logic-of-cuts-to-tree-maintenance/content_535.html": "menu\nAt the Members’ Forum in a Full Council meeting this week, Green councillor Carla Denyer asked the Mayor about cuts to Bristol’s street trees budget.\nCouncillor Denyer submitted joint questions with Green Councillor Clive Stevens [1] which noted several issues raised by the Bristol TreeForum:\n– The Council’s Highways Department did not consult the Council’s arboricultural officers, the TreeForum or any other relevant experts about street trees before making their decision to reduce the budget by 78%, which would effectively mean ceasing most tree maintenance.\n– The Highways department are justifying cuts by saying that they will maintain the minimum statutory service, regularly checking trees every few years, however, this is not cost-efficient as regular pollarding would be cheaper (a point on which horticultural experts agree [2]).\n– There has been no costed business case or risk assessment for the budget cuts.\nThe last point may be particularly significant as cuts to tree maintenance could potentially result in public damages, for example caused by trees falling on property, subsidence or people tripping over exposed roots, which the council could then be liable for.\nCouncillor Denyer also asked the Mayor whether the Council’s insurer (Zurich) was consulted over the decision to cut tree maintenance, and whether the insurance would remain valid to cover claims following the budget reductions. The Mayor was unable to answer the question, and promised a response in writing (at the time of writing this has not been received).\nSpeaking after the Full Council, Councillor Denyer said “I look forward to the Mayor’s response and hope it will shed some light on the issue of insurance. But I’m really worried that nobody in the Highways Department thought to run their proposals past any relevant experts before presenting them to Councillors. Quite aside from the huge value that street trees give to the city in terms of air quality, providing shade and improving wellbeing for residents, there is a simple financial issue here. Any savings made from reducing the maintenance budget could easily be wiped out by a couple of claims against the Council for injuries or damage to private property.”\n“The Mayor has assured me that there will be a consultation before these proposals are decided on – that is a small comfort at least. However, given that most of the Council’s recent consultations have been about how to cut services, not whether to cut them, we do not intend to let up on this until we have received proper answers.”",

  "https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_/https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_protecting-renters-shouldnt-mean-that-renters-pay-more/content_135.html": "menu\nGreen Councillor Carla Denyer has responded with alarm to Labour’s ‘five-point plan to protect renters’, which would require struggling tenants to take an economic hit, rather than landlords.\nGreen councillor Carla Denyer has said that Labour’s new plans do not go far enough to help people struggling to pay their rent during the coronavirus crisis, leaving the economic burden of lockdown on renters. Instead, she calls for rent arrears during the crisis to be forgiven, and an increase in benefits to help struggling tenants pay their rent in coming months. She says the onus should be on landlords to claim government relief rather than placing the burden on tenants.\nGreen councillor Carla Denyer asks,\n“Why should tenants on low incomes, many of whom will have seen a huge drop in their income during the coronavirus crisis, be forced to prop up landlord’s businesses out of their own pocket? The crisis affects us all, but it does not affect us all equally, and the burden is already falling heaviest on those who are least able to bear it.”\nThe Greens are calling for rent arrears to be forgiven, increased benefits to help tenants cover rent, extending the current ban on eviction proceedings, and an immediate end to no-fault evictions. In the longer term, the Green Party wants to bring in rent controls and more affordable housing.\nCouncillor Denyer, who has been supporting residents with financial issues since the crisis began, has called on the Government to do all it can to support renters, and has made a particular plea to local Labour MP and Shadow Housing Secretary Thangam Debbonaire to reconsider her party’s proposals [1] and heed the calls of tenants’ rights groups including ACORN [2] and London Renters Union.\nCouncillor Denyer continued:\n“Some of these proposals from the Labour Party are exactly right – the Green Party, along with many housing campaigners and unions, share their calls for extending the temporary ban on evictions, permanently scrapping Section 21 ‘no fault’ evictions, and adjusting benefits to cover rent more fully. We hope that the Government will adopt these changes as soon as possible.”\n“But we are concerned that the new Labour policy does not go far enough, as it just postpones rent arrears. Renters ultimately still take the economic hit. Those who have been unable to pay their rent because of lost earnings during lockdown are still made to pay it back, which will lead to a spiral of debt for many of the poorest in our country.”\nPoint 4 of the Labour plan puts the onus for dealing with any arrears onto tenants rather than landlords, and would result in renters having to pay off any arrears over the next 2 years. For example, if a tenant missed 3 months of rent payments (March, April and May) at £800 per month, they would owe £2400.\nCouncillor Denyer said:\n“Under the Labour plan, renters would be required to pay 100% of this back over 2 years. For someone whose rent is £800 a month for example, this would amount to an extra £100 per month, which will be unaffordable for many.”\nPressure to change the policy has also come from inside the Labour Party, with Momentum campaigners openly admitting that the Greens’ policy “outflanks” Labour [3].\nSian Berry, co-leader of the Green Party of England and Wales, outlined her party’s proposals in the Independent last month [4], saying:\n“Increasing housing benefit rates and income support to levels that cover rents is necessary, but the early stages of the crisis have seen many renters building up arrears as debt to their landlords.\n“Under the government’s plans, landlords are expected to put in place repayment plans once lockdown ends, and at the worst possible time. Without security for their jobs and incomes, renters cannot be expected to agree to service debts they have built up unfairly, and rent repayment schemes risk driving even more into poverty. The right way to approach this is to put the onus on landlords by cancelling all arrears built up so far and requiring landlords to claim back from the government for arrears accrued during the crisis, while also increasing benefit levels to cover rents in full for those who have lost incomes.”\nENDS\nNotes:\n1.

The government claim that the ‘purdah’ period in the run-up to the general election means they cannot take action until a new government is formed on 9th June.\nEnvironmental lawyers Client Earth won a second High Court challenge against the Environment Secretary Andrea Leadsom last November over her failure to take measures that would bring the UK into compliance with EU air quality laws [1]. The court set the Minister a deadline of 24 April to produce a new plan. The European Commission also sent a ‘final warning’ to the UK in February over its failure to address repeated breaches of legal air pollution limits in 16 areas including London and the South East [2]. The Government had two months to respond to the warning. The Government has failed to publish either its response to the Commission or its High Court-mandated plan to clean up Britain’s air [3].\nMolly Scott Cato, together with her Green MEP colleagues, Jean Lambert and Keith Taylor, have written to the Secretary of State for DEFRA , Andrea Leadsom, demanding to know why the Government has failed to fulfil its legal and moral duty [4]. They have also written to Environment Commissioner, Karmenu Vella, calling for the EU to take tough action against the Conservative Government [5].\nMolly Scott Cato, who is supporting the ‘Let Bristol Breathe’ campaign to tackle dangerous levels of air pollution in the city [6], said:\n“It’s a scandal that Tory Minsters show such shocking disregard for the UK’s legal and moral obligation to take action on air pollution. Even more outrageous that they are now seeking to use the general election as an excuse for inaction and to cover up their total failure to protect public health. Our air quality crisis is linked to more than 2,000 needless deaths across the South West and 300 deaths in Bristol every year [7].\n“That it is the European Commission and ClientEarth having to hold Theresa May to account for a public health crisis that costs the British public more than £20bn a year [8] is a shameful indictment of the Conservatives’ irresponsible and deadly apathy. The government readily acknowledges that any positive air quality action it has been forced to take has been driven by EU law [9]. But the Prime Minister’s plans for an extreme Brexit puts those vital EU safeguards at risk.”\nFi Hance, Bristol’s Green Party Assistant Mayor with responsibility for the City’s Air Quality management, says, “It is really disappointing that this unnecessary delay has been created. Bristol and other British cities desperately need a timely credible approach from National Government to ensure we can get on with the job of improving our local air quality.”\nDarren Hall, Green Party candidate for Metro-Mayor, added:\n“National government has repeatedly shown its complete lack of interest in one of the UK’s most pressing public health issues. As metro-mayor, I would ensure that clean air zones for both Bristol & Bath are prioritised as part of a cleaner and greener integrated transport strategy. It is imperative that children can go to school and play outside without damaging their lungs. Our plan demonstrates the practical steps that can be taken at local level to reduce the impact of pollution on so many people’s lives.”\nNotes\n[1] https://www.clientearth.org/major-victory-health-uk-high-court-government-inaction-air-pollution/\n[4] Letter to European Commissioner Karmenu Vella available here\n[5] Letter to Andrea Leadsom available here\n[6] http://www.bristolgreenparty.org.uk/let-bristol-breathe\n[7] https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/332854/PHE_CRCE_010.pdf and Air Quality Consultancy report for Bristol City Council 2016.\n[9] https://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/air-pollution/uk-eu-policy-contex",

The Lord Mayor is obliged to use a vehicle due to the number of engagements she travels to around Bristol and the need for her ceremonial garb and accessories to accompany her, but the new car, a Prius, is a ‘plug-in’ hybrid which will run solely off electricity for the vast majority of its trips in the city and thus produce no exhaust emissions while being driven. It will also be cheaper to run than the previous model due to the very low fuel costs, saving the council money.\nAir quality is a major concern in Bristol, which has multiple areas that frequently exceed legal limits for air pollution. It has been estimated that over 300 early deaths per year in the city (8.5% of annual deaths) are attributable to air pollution, which disproportionately impacts people living in some of the most deprived wards in Bristol, such as Lawrence Hill and Eastville.\nCleo said:\n“I am delighted with this new hybrid car which will ‘electrify’ Lord Mayoral duties around the city compared to the previous leased car which was diesel. Working towards a more environmentally conscious Lord Mayoral vehicle was one of my aims during my year and once I became aware that the lease on the current vehicle was up for renewal I felt this was the perfect opportunity.\n“Using a car unfortunately comes with the role as there is a lot of ceremonial clothing and items that must accompany me to up to four events a day across the city – but the replacement car will save the council money and be better for the city’s air quality, so it’s a win-win.”\nEleanor Combley, leader of the Green Councillor Group, welcomed the news, saying:\n“Lord Mayor Cleo Lake is a credit to the Greens and to the City of Bristol. Air pollution kills hundreds of people in Bristol each year, so I am really proud that she has taken the opportunity to lead by example and do what she can in her role to make a difference.”\nBackground info:\n– Health Impacts of Air Pollution in Bristol – February 2017 report by Air Quality Consultants commissioned by Bristol City Council https://www.bristol.gov.uk/documents/20182/32675/Health+Impacts+of+Air+Pollution+in+Bristol+February+2017/4df2fce5-e2fc-4c22-b5c7-5e7a5ae56701\n– Bristol deprivation statistics are available at https://www.bristol.gov.uk/documents/20182/32951/Deprivation+in+Bristol+2015/429b2004-eeff-44c5-8044-9e7dcd002faf",
  "https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_/https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_council-welcomes-refugees/content_867.html": "menu\nThis is a follow up on a previous article from 4th September.\nBristol Councillors from across the political spectrum came together last night, supporting a motion calling for Bristol to welcome its share of refugees to Bristol.\nThe motion saw the four party groups put aside their political differences, working together to table a joint motion calling on Bristol Council to immediately commit to host 50 refugees. This would form a starting point towards ensuring Bristol is hosting its share of refugees fleeing conflict.\n‘I am delighted that Councillors have chosen to work together to make sure that Bristol lives up to its status as City of Sanctuary’ said Councillor Fi Hance, a long time campaigner on the issue. ‘We are calling on the Mayor to immediately pledge to take an initial 50 refugees and to accept refugees from Syria under the government’s Vulnerable People Resettlement Scheme’.\n‘The Local Government Association, who are coordinating the response from local councils, have called on councils to clarify the number of refugees they could host. It is time for the Mayor to make at least an initial commitment, which we then hope can be built upon in the future’ Councillor Hance continued.\nAssistant Mayor for Neighbourhoods, which includes council housing and responding to new arrivals to Bristol neighbourhoods, Daniella Radice, said: ‘We are continuing to call on central Government to provide additional funding to local authorities, so that those fleeing persecution and war can be properly supported. We are pleased that the Government has begun to buckle to public pressure calling on Britain to do more, but this has to be more than just empty words.’\nCouncillor Radice added: ‘It is an accident of birth that some people are born in countries suffering from conflict, while others are lucky enough not to. At the weekend 3000 people took to the streets to welcome refugees and call for Bristol to lead the way in hosting those seeking safety. We hope that this motion will start to make that call a reality.’\nThe motion was voted through at Full Council on Tuesday 15th September, the Mayor will now decide the way forward.\nFULL COUNCIL MOTION – 15 SEPTEMBER 2015\nCITY OF SANCTUARY STATUS\n“This Council calls on the Mayor to give real meaning to our “City of Sanctuary” status by working with housing providers, charities, faith organisations and other partners to ensure that Bristol City Council plays its part in housing refugees caught up in the current humanitarian crisis.\nWe especially call on the Mayor to agree as a matter of urgency to authorise officers to accept refugees from Syria under the government’s Vulnerable People Resettlement scheme. We are aware that this issue was raised with the Mayor as early as February of this year, and would therefore urge him to take immediate action.\nBristol City Council, as a City of Sanctuary must agree to play a significant role in accepting refugees. Glasgow, Kingston (London), Birmingham and Edinburgh have already agreed to take 50 refugees each. As one of the larger cities in the UK, Bristol City Council should immediately pledge to take 50 refugees as a starting point towards playing our part in hosting refugees fleeing conflict from across the world.\nThis Council further asks the Mayor to write to HM Government asking them to support cities and communities who want to make a difference at least for some of these refugees.”",
  "https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_/https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_public-consultation-devolution/content_766.html": "menu\nOn Weds 29th July the three Councils of Bristol, Bath and North East Somerset and South Gloucestershire voted to move forward with a West of England devolution deal which would give the region more autonomy over housing and transport decisions and bring in £30 million a year of investment.1\nLeader of the Green Councillors, Charlie Bolton said:\n“Greens have been working throughout the devolution negotiations to ensure that any deal does not just focus on economic growth at any cost. Our regions need good quality, warm and affordable housing and an improved public transport system that benefits all. We are pleased that as a result Bristol Council voted last night for equality and environmental sustainability to be key criteria for any project looking to be funded by the new deal”2\n“One of our biggest concerns throughout the deal has been the lack of consultation, both with councillors, but more importantly with the public. The public consultation on devolution will open on 4th July and we have been campaigning to ensure that this is able to influence and change the deal – after all what is the point in consulting the public if what they say is unable to change anything?”\nThe public consultation will run for six weeks from 4th July, and it has now been agreed that it will come back to councillors for further consideration before being submitted with Councils response to the Secretary of State who has the final decision on whether the deal goes ahead.\nCouncillor Bolton continued:\n“As Greens, we feel that this devolution deal has good elements and bad elements. We want joined up thinking on public transport, more local decision making powers on housebuilding and more investment in our region. But we don’t feel real devolution should be about centralising control into the hands of a cabinet headed by a Metro-Mayor with worryingly little accountability or scrutiny.”3\n“The mixed nature of this deal makes the public consultation all the more important. We are calling on everyone to get involved, input and suggest changes to a deal that will shape how decisions are made across the region for years to come.”\nThe proposed ‘West of England deal’ was approved by Bristol, BANES and South Glos at their Cabinet and Full Council meetings on Weds 29th June.\nFull Council voted in favour of the comments made by Overview and Scrutiny Management Board\nGreen councillors submitted a statement to Cabinet and Full Council outlining their concerns with the deal.\nResidents can input into the consultation on devolution",
  "https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_/https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_greens-and-labour-work-together-on-zero-carbon-building-regulations/content_118.html": "menu\nThe buildings being approved in Bristol now – and the planning policies used to determine what standards are required from them – will help determine whether the city meets its ambitious target to go carbon neutral by 2030, set in 2018 following the Climate Emergency motion proposed by Greens and passed unanimously.\nBristol Green and Labour Councillors worked together on a motion to last night’s (7 September) Full Council meeting which would see all new developments in Bristol required to meet zero carbon emissions standards. Greens authored the motion and then collaborated with the Labour group on changes to it after Labour cabinet members made detailed suggestions to support the motion’s aims, and ensure they could be fully implemented at the nearest opportunity. Seconded by Labour’s Housing Cabinet lead Tom Renhard, the motion passed with unanimous support from all parties.\nUnder current regulations, many new developments built will require expensive retrofitting work in a few years’ time to reduce their energy usage. This makes it more difficult and expensive for the city to reduce its emissions but could also place a burden on new occupants, who might face paying for the cost of retrofitting. The motion brought by Greens and Labour calls on the Council to update its Local Plan as soon as possible to require net zero carbon emissions from new developments in the city.\nGreen Councillor for Windmill Hill, Lisa Stone, who proposed the motion, said:\n“To its credit, Bristol was the first city to declare a climate emergency in the UK back in 2018. At the time we set a tough, ambitious target for the city to go carbon neutral by 2030. We now have an opportunity to help make that target achievable, by imposing strong carbon emissions limits for energy and power in all new homes built in Bristol. As well as tackling climate change, we know that housing built to high standards brings other benefits like better insulation and lower energy bills.\n“I was happy to work with the Labour group on alterations to help put my motion into practice by bringing tougher energy requirements into the Local Plan currently being updated. So I’m delighted the motion has passed – this sends a strong signal from Full Council, and I expect to see it reflected in the plan.\n“Councillors from all parties voted for the Climate Emergency motion back in 2018 – it’s now time for us to put that into practice. As the recent IPCC report makes clear, the cost for all of us of failing to prepare for the future is too great to bear.”",

  "https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_/https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_labour-cabinet-pass-potentially-illegal-transport-plan/content_238.html": "menu\nLast night Bristol’s Labour cabinet passed a regional transport plan that Greens warned is incompatible with the climate emergency and may be illegal under the UK’s climate commitments.\nGreens, environmentalists and transport experts had previously lobbied West of England Councils to amend the new Joint Local Transport Plan (JLTP) as it committed millions of pounds to roadbuilding and widening projects but did not reserve funding for public transport, walking and cycling. Yesterday Green councillors warned that the plans may even be illegal after a legal precedent set by the High Court’s decision to reject a third runway at Heathrow. North Somerset council had pledged to amend plans before they were approved at the regional authority but Bristol’s Labour cabinet ignored calls from activists to do the same.\nGreen Councillor Steve Clarke chairs WECA’s Overview and Scrutiny committee, which on January 31 called for the authority to reassess major schemes in the light of the Climate Emergency. Before the meeting he warned of the legal risk, saying:\n“The decision by high court judges to rule out Heathrow’s planned third runway has set a legal precedent – the ‘Paris Agreement’ on climate change that the UK signed up to in 2016 must be taken into account in major infrastructure decisions. Therefore the Joint Local Transport Plan, which is coming before Cabinet this evening, may now be illegal if it is not amended or updated before being approved. This is because it contains major road building provisions but it does not appear to have taken into account the legally binding provisions of the Paris Agreement.”\nDuring the meeting Labour’s transport lead Kye Dudd acknowledged the concerns of campaigners, suggesting the plan would be “reviewed straight away” after it had been approved by the West of England Combined Authority (WECA). However he did not provide further information as to what that review would target or when it might take place. Once approved the plan will have statutory force and reviewing or changing it would be a lengthy and complicated process.\nReferring to the Heathrow decision, an Extinction Rebellion (XR) representative in the public gallery stated that XR “reserves the right to call a judicial review” on the plans if they proceed, threatening legal action under the precedent set by the Heathrow decision.\nLabour’s former Transport lead Cllr Mhairi Threlfall agreed with Greens and other opponents to the plan. She said that as a document the JLTP was “a little bit meaningless” and that once approved it would be a statutory document – her recommendation was to strip out the problems in the document before it was agreed.\nGreen Councillor Carla Denyer had lobbied the Mayor to amend the plan two weeks before the meeting. At Cabinet she asked the Cabinet Transport lead to commit to scrap climate-damaging road projects in the plan before approving it but did not receive a direct answer. Responding to the outcome outside the meeting, Councillor Denyer said:\n“Just last week the Mayor tweeted his support for Greta Thunberg – but today his cabinet refused to commit to removing new road building from the regional plan. Cabinet member Kye Dudd’s comments initially seemed positive, saying that Bristol City Council would push for a review of the plan in light of the Climate Emergency. However, when I asked if he would explicitly commit to scrap the road building and widening plans in the Joint Local Transport Plan before it is approved by WECA on 20th March, he declined to answer. When pressed, he tried to deflect the question by pointing out that the new roads planned are outside the Bristol City Council area. This is true, but beside the point.\nBristol’s Mayor has substantial power, as one of the four members of WECA, to make the decision on the JLTP for the whole region. When WECA declared a climate emergency last July, Marvin Rees said that it must focus on the “less glamorous” details of how the region’s carbon emissions could be reduced – this report is the perfect example of that. But Mayor Rees and his Cabinet have chosen to stick with business as usual instead of using their power to tackle the Climate Emergency – not just for Bristol but the whole of the West of England.\nThe plans noted at Cabinet this evening will increase congestion on local roads, increase carbon emissions, and may even be illegal as they’re out of step with the UK’s Climate Commitments. In good faith, I emailed Marvin Rees last month about the report, ahead of cabinet deadlines, so that he would be best able to prepare for it. No amount of spin or PR from the Mayor can hide the gap between his words and his cabinet’s actions on climate change.”",

Boundary changes coming into effect in May 2016 will see Ashley enlarge from two to three Councillors.\nA strongly Green ward since Cllr Gus Hoyt was first elected there in 2011, the Greens retained Ashley in May 2015 with 51% of the vote, the only Party to win a ward with an overall majority in that round of elections.\nAshley Greens are supporting the Saxon Road Green Space community group in opposing a planning application that seeks to build a fossil fuel power station on brownfield land in St Werburgh’s [2]. Objections to the planning application can be made through the Council’s planning portal until 11th November [3].\nResponding to concerns of residents across the ward, Councillor Hoyt has urged Mayor George Ferguson to trial banning glyphosate, a harmful weedkiller, in Ashley. Meanwhile, Greens in Ashley have been calling for investment to counter the current lack of youth provision in St Pauls and promote healthier, more cohesive communities.\nThe May 2016 boundary changes will see the whole of St Andrews park come into Ashley. This is welcomed by the Greens as previously the park has been divided between three wards, making it harder to address issues efficiently.\nGus Hoyt, current Councillor for the ward and well known food campaigner, said, “It’s been great serving Ashley the last five years and it’d be a honour to do so for a further four. It’s a tough time for local councils; the cuts are making it tougher for local people, especially in an inner city ward, but I feel confident in rising to this challenge for another four years”.\nJude English, who teaches Energy & Sustainability with Open University, is a supply teacher in local schools, and a Trustee of St Werburgh’s City Farm, said, “I am keen to work with local community members to publicise our policies on providing a welcoming City of Sanctuary to those who seek a safe place to live, work, and bring up children. As a teacher and active trade union member, I will promote our policies on free education and workers’ rights, including our commitment to a genuine living wage”.\nSimon Stafford-Townsend, a psychotherapist in private practice and Chair of Trustees for Montpelier based therapy charity The Swan Project, said, “a strong motivation for me standing in this election is to oppose austerity, especially with the worst of the Tories’ cuts to Council budgets yet to come. The single greatest challenge our generation faces is climate change, yet the Tories are aggressively preventing development of renewables, and it’s increasingly obvious George Ferguson has squandered Bristol’s year as European Green Capital. We need a Green Mayor for a sustainable Bristol, and more Green Councillors for sustainable communities”.\nTony Dyer, Green Party Mayoral Candidate, said, “the May election which saw Gus re-elected with a record breaking 4,500 votes says much more about his standing as a local councillor than anything I could possibly say. With the addition of Jude and Simon, and their expertise in education, health and wellbeing, social justice, and climate change, we have a candidate team with the skills and ability to tackle the many challenges facing Bristol’s largest and most socially diverse inner city ward.”\n[1] See Photo 1 – (from left to right) Councillor Gus Hoyt in front of bollards closing off Hurlingham Road to through-traffic; Jude English outside St Pauls Learning Centre; Simon Stafford-Townsend in front of the Windrush mural at St Pauls community recycling centre\n[2] – Saxon Road Green Space are a community interest group.

Since the council session last November, the council has set up a Mayoral Air Quality Working Group, which has secured government funding and started working on a feasibility study to explore different types of Clean Air Zones. Additionally the council has also secured government funding to retrofit polluting buses and provide electric vehicle infrastructure.\nGreen Cabinet member and Chair of the working group Fi Hance, said: “I’m glad the work is underway now and pleased the council is taking everyone’s concerns seriously. It’s important to get this right so we are using the input of a wide variety of experts to ensure the best outcome for Bristolians.”\nAir quality is increasingly flagged as an urgent health issue as research emerges on its harmful consequences. Last year the Royal College of Physicians warned that air pollution, measured as the concentration of fine particulate matter (called PM2.5) in the air, contributes to about 40,000 early deaths a year in the UK. Air pollution has been linked to cancer, asthma, stroke and heart disease, diabetes and obesity, lower IQ among children, and an average decrease in life expectancy of 9-11 years for an increase in PM2.5 of 10 micrograms (one-millionth of a gram) per cubic metre.\nResearch commissioned by the Council and published in February this year found that around 300 deaths in the City each year can be attributed to air pollution from PM2.5 and nitrogen dioxide – about 8.5% (or 1 in 12) of deaths in Bristol overall. Impacts are highest in some of the City’s most deprived areas – in Lawrence Hill and Central wards, over 10% of deaths are attributable to poor air quality.\nAt the end of the month the government is expected to publish its updated air quality plans which will spell out the powers available to cities like Bristol in introducing Clean Air Zones. Green leader Councillor Eleanor Combley said: “We know that deprived communities are much more affected by air pollution than affluent areas – it is an equality issue as well as a danger to the environment and public health. We applaud the formation of the Mayoral Air Quality Working Group in response to all party support for action. We’ll be looking forward to its findings eagerly, and are keen to support decisive action that will reverse this blight on people’s health and lives in the city. Nothing should be ruled out at this stage – in particular it is likely that in order to work properly Clean Air Zones will need to introduce charging for all older diesel vehicles including cars. Bristol must deal with this issue with the urgency it demands as a genuine public health crisis.”",

Liveable Neighbourhoods are supported by a broad network of community groups, including groups representing older people, young people and children, disabled people, people advocating travel by foot or bike, and groups tackling climate change, have come together to form Liveable Neighbourhoods for Bristol https://liveablebristol.org.uk/ to call for change.\nThe Liveable Neighbourhoods model builds on successes in parts of London, such as Waltham Forest, Birmingham and Manchester to prevent minor residential streets being used as rat-runs, while improving streets with parklets, play space and more greenery\nNeighbourhoods choose to prevent traffic rat-running on certain through-roads, though those walking and on bikes are allowed through. Through-traffic is routed on bigger roads around the neighbourhood rather than through it. This makes local roads quieter for those who live there. Residents and their visitors are still able to enter, as are delivery vehicles.\nSandy Hore-Ruthven, Bristol Green Party candidate for Mayor, says:\n“Bristol prides itself on being a good place to live – but it could be better, our neighbourhoods and communities should be built around people – places where children are safe on the streets, where the air is clean, business flourishes, and neighbours can meet and talk.\n“Liveable Neighbourhoods are just that, neighbourhoods that are a good place to live. Neighbourhoods with only essential traffic entering – so that residents feel safe walking their children to school and we can breathe clean safe air. All the evidence shows Liveable Neighbourhoods means business flourishes because people stay and spend more – increasing much needed footfall and trade. Bristol should be leading the way.”\nLiveable Neighbourhoods for Bristol, a new network of community groups, has launched a petition calling on the Mayor to work with local communities to introduce Liveable Neighbourhoods across the city by 2024.\nCarla Denyer, Councillor for Clifton Down ward, explains:\n“This isn’t about imposing things on people, it’s about listening to what they want. The exact changes needed will differ from place to place, as local people tend to know their streets best and what needs to change.”\n“The coronavirus pandemic has also made it even more urgent to address our air pollution problem, as there is increasing evidence that those who breathe dirty air are more likely to be badly affected by the virus. And many local businesses and cafes are desperate for more outside space to help boost their recovery – which is achievable with a Liveable Neighbourhoods model.\n“When I speak to residents across the city they are crying out for change. It is high time our streets become the thriving hearts of our communities again.”\nAlex Stephenson, a spokesperson for Liveable Neighbourhoods for Bristol, says:\n“There is a huge appetite from local people across Bristol to unlock the potential of our streets and public spaces, to make them safer, quieter, healthier, and more pleasant. Rat-running traffic on residential streets impacts the life quality of too many Bristol residents and now is the time to do something about it.”\n“We’re delighted that Bristol Green Party are supporting our campaign and look forward to working with them and other stakeholders in Bristol to create Liveable Neighbourhoods across the city.”",

These are things the people of Bristol have consistently asked for.”\nHe added:\n“Prioritising short-term economic growth is inherently risky. We absolutely need to create jobs, but in sectors that are actually growing and sustainable – low carbon engineering, innovative technologies, and the high tech/creative sectors. This is why the Greens have submitted an amendment3, calling for clear commitments that address inequality and demonstrate that environmental sustainability will be central.”\n“We need a joined up approach to our region’s future. We need the infrastructure investment included within this deal, but we also need to ensure that the people whom this infrastructure is intended to benefit have a real say on how it is delivered.

The plan was heralded as “ground breaking” and a “world first” by the Disability News Service, which said “it is believed to be the first time anywhere in the world that so many disabled people have been involved in co-producing a plan to take action to address climate change.” The plan has drawn interest from the government as well as disability rights and climate action organisations.\nThe plan was designed to highlight ways of taking action on climate change that do not create new barriers for disabled people. It contains 65 recommendations for action, including ‘community’ actions and those decision makers such as councils and other public bodies would need to implement. Some of the actions proposed are for blue badge holders in Bristol to be allowed to use bus lanes, action to tackle pavement obstacles, and for local buses to have at least two wheelchair spaces (currently they only have one).\nBristol Councillor Katy Grant is the Green Group’s joint lead on Climate and Ecology. She welcomed the report and called on “the people and institutions of Bristol” to “rise to the challenge it poses to all of us”.\nCouncillor Grant said:\n“People with disabilities will be particularly impacted by the effects of climate change and yet their views on the subject have been systematically ignored by governments around the world. So it was great to read Bristol Disability Equality Forum’s Community Climate Action Plan, published last week.\n“It’s an excellent plan – clear, accessible, and thoughtful, with aims and actions that sit at the nexus of disability rights and climate action. The action plan is really comprehensive and speaks to all the sectors where climate action is needed – food, waste, energy, nature, housing etc. Aims are listed as ‘city-owned’ or ‘community-owned’ which is a great way to highlight accountability, but it’s empowering as well, providing a chance for all stakeholders to do their bit.\n“As a Green Shadow Cabinet member for Climate and Ecology, I call on WECA to respond to the plan by appointing a Disability Transport Champion, to push for improvements in our public transport, such as two wheelchair spaces in every bus. Equally, Bristol City Council must ensure that actions to encourage walking includes dropped kerbs, and reduces pavement parking, to include those using mobility aids. I fully support this plan and I hope that the people and institutions of Bristol can rise to the challenge it poses to all of us.”",

Concerns over the contentious deal have prompted a massive Europe-wide campaign with thousands of citizens signing petitions, organising street demonstrations, and attending public meetings.\nKeith Taylor, Green MEP for the South East said:\n“TTIP negotiators cannot continue to ignore public opinion. If the deal goes ahead, foreign investors will be able to sue governments using secret courts if their profits are threatened by national laws.

The public don’t want this as shown very clearly by the one million people who signed the petition”.\nJean Lambert, Green MEP for London said:\n“Public pressure has already brought more transparency to the process and increased pressure not to include the controversial private tribunal system to settle company claims against governments.

A million citizens from Europe are demanding that their voices be heard; we urge the Commission to listen.”\nNotes\n[1] Letter to Trade Commisioner Cecilia Malmström:\nDear Commissioner Malmström,\nToday, representatives of civil society from across the European Union will be presenting President Juncker with a petition signed by more than a million European citizens raising serious objections to the ongoing negotiations over the TTIP trade treaty. While the day is chosen to mark Mr Juncker’s 60th birthday the gift clearly has serious as well as humorous implications.\nWe appreciate the fact that since taking over as Trade Commissioner you have focused on increasing the transparency around TTIP and what is being negotiated in our names and the names of our constituents. However, as people know more about the negative consequences of the treaty – whether in terms of the threats to democracy from ISDS or the threats to environmental and social standards – the less they like what they see.\nAs Greens we are keen Europeans and yet we see the increasing and unaccountable power of multinational corporations in European societies as well as within the EU institutions themselves as a significant threat to the future of EU, as citizens lose confidence that we are all working in their best interests. The large increase in votes for anti-European populist parties is evidence of this trend and we believe that the negotiation of a trade treaty behind closed doors and with such a high level of corporate lobbying is undermining our attempts to argue for the UK’s continuing membership of the European Union.\nWe have been astonished that a highly technical treaty on an issue that has rarely received media attention has become a massive nationwide campaign with thousands of citizens signing petitions, organising street demonstrations, and attending public meetings across the UK. We have all been overwhelmed by emails from irate constituents who are enraged by what EU negotiators are doing. This is an issue where the public are insisting on their voices being heard.\nThe petition that will be presented today demands that a European Citizens Initiative is launched relating to TTIP. We ask you to reconsider the decision taken by the previous Commission to reject TTIP as a suitable subject for such an Initiative.

I avoid using terms ‘Slave Trade’ because for us there was no legitimate trade. It was the greatest crime against humanity so we refer to it as the Maangamizi, a term we claim for ourselves as we set upon creating our own identities in our own images.”\nConnecting the historic injustice of slavery to current issues, Councillor Lake noted that reparations should be part of resolving the climate emergency at the global level. She said:\n“We can’t begin to combat climate change if we allow corporations, often backed by governments, to continue to loot, pillage and destroy African countries and communities.

Described as ‘a tiny tax for big change’, the Financial Transaction Tax (FTT) which is also referred to as a Robin Hood Tax or Tobin Tax, is a small levy on financial transactions on products such as shares, bonds and derivatives. More than a million people have signed a petition calling for such a tax, the proceeds from which would go towards funding public services, investing in infrastructure, addressing poverty and fighting climate change. It could raise more than £8bn of additional revenue a year from a tiny tax of about 0.05% on transactions carried out by financial institutions. It is estimated it would take just over three days of FTT revenue to fund the salaries of 1,000 new police constables, 1,000 newly qualified nurses and 1,000 teachers.2\nCllr Denyer said:\n“The effects of reckless banking practices in the City of London have been felt by every community in the UK and many around the world – it is only right banks now pay their fair share to repair the damage they have caused. If local councils are being asked to bear cuts of more than 40% that have hit local people hard, it doesn’t seem unreasonable to ask the banks to pay a tax of as little as 0.05% of their transactions.”\nIf Bristol City Council were to pass this motion, it will join 72 other UK Councils who have passed a similar motion, including neighbouring Bath & North East Somerset.3\nCllr Denyer added, “The broad support from Councils and Councillors across the country and political spectrum should encourage the Government to adopt the FTT, as it gives them a clear mandate. I hope to add Bristol to that list to strengthen the case further. Unfortunately, this month my motion is at the end of the agenda, so there will probably not be time to debate it. However, I will keep on submitting it until the debate takes place. I (and Robin) will be back!”\nMolly Scott Cato, Bristol’s Green MEP, said:\n“The willingness of the Tories to oppose and block this popular and common sense tax at every turn shows a government that is putting the huge profits of the City ahead of the needs of some of the world’s poorest communities, public services in this country and the climate.”\n“A Financial Transaction tax is small change for the financial sector but could go a long way to helping deliver economic and climate justice. Last December 10 EU Finance Ministers publicly declared their support for the tax. The UK of course wasn’t one of them and with Theresa May threatening to turn the UK into a low tax economy, Brexit makes it even less likely we will see this tax introduced in the UK.

This sort of high-speed trading is thought to be a major factor in financial market volatility and which contributes to volatility in financial markets. Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown, due to speak at the Bristol Festival of Economics on Tuesday, supported the tax back in 2009 as a way to prevent further financial crises.\nPerhaps more importantly, the FTT, a tiny tax of about 0.05% on transactions carried out by financial institutions, also has the potential to generate more than £5bn of additional revenue a year which could go towards funding the UK’s squeezed public services, investing in infrastructure, addressing poverty and fighting climate change. It is estimated that this funding could plug last year’s NHS funding gap, fix the adult social care crisis and hire 20,000 new teachers with money left over to build more than 70,000 affordable homes.\nCllr Denyer said:\n“The effects of reckless banking practices in the City of London have been felt by every community in the UK and many around the world – it is only right banks now pay their fair share to repair the damage they have caused. The crisis in local council finances is really coming home to Bristol with plans to close libraries and pull funding from Parks and even core services like Children and Adult Social Care. In this context it doesn’t seem unreasonable to ask the banks to pay a tax of as little as 0.05% of their transactions.”\nIf Bristol City Council were to pass this motion, it will join 72 other UK Councils who have passed a similar motion, including neighbouring Bath & North East Somerset.\nCllr Denyer added, “Broad support from Councils and Councillors across the country and political spectrum would put pressure on the Government to adopt the FTT, giving them a clear mandate at a time when they need policies with cross party-support more than ever. I hope to add Bristol to that list to strengthen the case further. Unfortunately, as with last time, there will probably not be time to debate the motion this month.

This year, I was hoping for a reminder of the Mayor’s vision for the city and the progress we have made.\nFirstly, there is no doubt that the Council is in a difficult financial position. This means the scope for investing in services and new developments in Bristol is limited. However, it also makes it more important that we use the money we do have wisely and take fleet-footed action when and where we can. Unfortunately, it seems the opposite is happening at City Hall.\nLast night’s address sounded and felt like a ‘management report’ not a vision for the city. The Mayor listed achievements that seemed to amount to a lot plans, strategies and consultations. The response to our problems with traffic and pollution is, for example, a transport strategy that sets out the need for more plans and feasibility studies. A review of RPZs was just that – a review with no\nchange. A challenge to the schools’ admissions process resulted in a ‘summit for 100 education partners who shared good practice’. More ‘planning’ is underway for the Western Harbour and a ‘working group’ has been gathered to ‘secure the future of our city centre’.\nThe Mayor mentioned the arena again, so I will too, because it is the one thing that would have brought some new life to our city in his term of office. A shovel ready project that would have left front line services untouched has been replaced by, you guessed it, a ‘plan’ for a mixed-use development – the conference centre no one in Bristol ever dreamt of.\nIn fact, as far as I can tell, housing seemed to be the only real achievement of the last two and a half years. For that, Cllr Paul Smith and council officers should be congratulated, as Bristol seems to be adding around 1% (2000 homes) to its housing stock every year. We were starting from a relatively low base so to be hitting a national average for house building is a real achievement to be celebrated.\nBefore the Mayor’s speech, I had called on the administration to be more ambitious. Now that the cap on borrowing is being lifted I think we should raise our sights even further. It was telling that this administration would rather celebrate its modest success, than aim higher.\nUltimately ‘plans’ are only as good as the difference they make. How many less people do we have sleeping rough or without homes? Is the air that we are breathing cleaner? How many homes have been insulated? How many people have new jobs and how many people are bringing home a living wage for their families? These are a few of the questions I would like to have heard answered.\nNobody is expecting miracles. It is tough to get things done when we have little cash but if a plan does not lead to change it represents a real a waste of the valuable and limited resources, we have. Which is surely almost worse than doing nothing?",

We do not accept their argument that the 58 sector studies could weaken the UK’s negotiating position. This is clear from the fact that several other EU member states and the Commission have already released comparable information into the public domain.

Our old fashioned, home grown common law gives us the right to see these documents – not just whatever’s left after a Minister, desperate for secrecy, has gone at them with a thick black marker pen.”\nIn the letter to DExEU and the Treasury the lawyers representing Dr Scott Cato and Mr Maugham acknowledge the parliamentary motion requiring release of the documents and will take into account any further relevant developments – including any public disclosure of information falling within the scope of the request – before deciding what documents to demand in the High Court action.\nNotes\nSee the thread of correspondence relating to this case here.",
  "https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_/https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_budget-day-blues/content_675.html": "menu\nTomorrow is the annual Budget Full Council meeting in Bristol. It’s probably the single most important meeting I will attend all year, and has taken up a huge amount of my time in recent weeks.\nA lot of people have been saying “I hope it goes well” and I’ve had to reply grimly “It’s not going to.” Nobody is going to come out of this meeting a winner except the Conservative Government and their successful imposition of the austerity agenda onto another local authority for another year.\nThe best we can hope for is to make things a bit less gut-wrenchingly awful. Why? Because the Government has been making HUGE cuts to local authorities for years, and because Labour have not been the opposition that everyone was hoping for.\nSadly I’m not exaggerating how bad the budget cuts are – this year Bristol’s Labour Mayor is making around £100million of cuts, and previous years (under an independent Mayor) there have been cuts of similar orders of magnitude. In a few years from now the grant from national government will be ZERO, because government is expecting Councils to generate ALL of their own income from:\n• Council tax (even though it’s a horribly regressive tax which benefits the rich),\n• Business rates (which only wealthy areas get significant amounts of, so – oh look – that benefits the rich again),\n• Charging for services (which will only generate significant income in – well blow me down, rich areas!).\nThis means that in the future 0% of your Income Tax (the only vaguely progressive tax that actually charges rich people more) will go towards local services; it will only pay for national government departments, MP’s salaries, the military, etc. Funnily enough, these are also the areas that are mostly being cut less, which is helping to keep Income Tax down for the Tories’ wealthy friends.\nWe as Greens have been trying to push Bristol’s Labour Mayor into taking up this fight with the Government. The Government will, realistically, never listen to 11 Green councillors from one city. But if Marvin and the other 9 Labour leaders of the 10 ‘core cities’ joined with the Greens and other progressive parties and unions the message would be so much stronger. If they were to join us in prioritising sending a united and firm message saying “no, you can’t do this, people are going to die because of these cuts, you have to give us more” and refused to cooperate until they listened, well that’s an incredibly large combined population to say no to. But Marvin hasn’t done that. He’s obediently passing on the £100m of cuts to Bristol’s services – the ones that keep people out of hospital, off the streets, in education.\nSo seeing that our attempts at ‘soft power’ persuasion were not working on him, we tried more ‘hard power’ attempts – we drafted a handful of budget amendments to be formally proposed, seconded and voted on at tomorrow’s budget meeting. They included some great ideas for marginally increasing this year’s revenue by paying off loans at a different rate, councillors giving up perks and seeking new ways to create income (1). But on Friday afternoon we were told that all 37 Labour councillors will be whipped to vote against all of our amendments, and the amendments of all other parties meaning that they will all fall, as Labour have an absolute majority. This is despite the fact that all the Green amendments align with Labour’s professed policies. What’s the point of having policies at all if you abandon them the moment the Conservative Government tells you that you have to?\nSo no, tomorrow isn’t going to go well by any definition, and I’m going to be in a foul mood about it for a while. Next time your local library/school/children’s centre/old people’s home/etc closes, your bins aren’t collected, your friend with a drug addiction stops getting free treatment, your disabled aunt stops getting the benefits she needs to live independently, the news reports that homelessness has quadrupled in the city… please remember what I’ve said.

  "https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_/https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_geen-councillors-lets-build-bristols-arena-in-bristol/content_472.html": "menu\nStatement by Bristol Green Councillors Jerome Thomas and Stephen Clarke: Let’s Build Bristol’s Arena at Temple Meads\nOn behalf of Bristol’s Greens we’d like to register our concern about the delays getting started on Bristol’s proposed arena and now the exploration of a site on Filton airfield as a possible alternative venue.\nWe appreciate the Mayor’s concerns and efforts to get the best possible arena deal for Bristol. However, it seems there is now a fixed price bid of under £120 million from Buckingham Group to build an arena on Arena Island next to Bristol Temple Meads station. As a result the city’s exposure to cost overruns will be minimised. Buckingham Group have solid experience of developments of this kind and so we can have a good level of confidence that the city can get the arena it wants at a price that is manageable.\nBristol is the only one of the UK’s Core Cities to have no city centre arena. Major arena and sporting venues elsewhere exist in city centres with limited parking. Whether it’s the Glasgow Arena, the Manchester Arena or even the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, these are all centre of city locations with good public transport links and minimal parking provision. Detailed discussions about the level of parking provision for the Bristol arena should not distract us from getting the right location for the arena in the first place.\nAn arena in the centre of our city with great transport links will provide people in Bristol and the surrounding regions with the opportunity to see national acts that currently pass us by. Siting the arena on Arena Island is a wonderful opportunity to regenerate and open up this part of the city, providing employment opportunities for people living in walking distance of the site in Ashley, Easton, Lawrence Hill, Brislington East, Brislington West, Windmill Hill, Central and other neighbouring city wards. It will also strengthen the economic vitality of our city centre retailers and other service businesses and allow us to grow the essential revenue the city receives from its business rates. These are some of the reasons this site was selected in the first place.\nA Bristol arena at Filton airfield would require a significant amount of parking to service it, in an area that already suffers from severe congestion and traffic jams on a daily basis. Being located some distance from the centre of Bristol it would provide little additional benefit to arena guests nor added value to businesses in the city.\nWhile we recognise that the construction of an arena is expensive, particularly in times of austerity, we have already spent over £10 million on the development of this site and any alternative site could be significantly more expensive. As well as the guaranteed revenue from the arena operator over a ten year period of over £30 million, we also note that good property investment decisions by the city and potential windfall property gains could result in capital gains to the city in excess of £25 million. These capital gains could further offset the cost to the city of the proposed development.\nApproving and starting work on the Bristol Arena on Arena Island in January 2018 would be exactly the kind of decisive action that City hopes for from its elected Mayor. By the time the Global Parliament of Mayors comes to Bristol next year, construction of the arena would be in full flow; a practical demonstration that Bristol’s elected mayors can deliver for the city.\nCouncillors Stephen Clarke and Jerome Thomas",

  "https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_/https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_the-power-to-transform-the-south-west/content_890.html": "menu\nAt @Bristol yesterday morning (23rd April) an extremely important report ‘The Power to Transform the South West’ was unveiled. The report (commissioned by Green MEP Molly Scott-Cato and researched and written by the Resilience Centre) outlines the amazing capacity of the South West to exceed all of its own energy needs, and become an exporter of energy to the rest of the UK; by investing in the transition to a diversified renewable energy system.\nThe report draws together the great wealth of studies on the potential of various renewable energy sources that already exists, and draws them into a comprehensive plan of what an entirely fossil free South West would look like. This covers everything from energy storage and transmission, required infrastructural and grid upgrades, and of course the potential (and requirements) of each different renewable energy source across the region.\nSpecial emphasis is placed on the economic impact of implementing the plan, which has the potential to create 122,000 jobs in the region (where unemployment numbers 126,000) and directly add over £4.2 billion to value of the local economy (48% the total value of the South West’s tourism industry, or 87% of the total value of its aerospace and defence industries). A mix of onshore and offshore wind, marine and tidal, solar, geothermal and biomass dispersed across the region can meet all our long term energy needs; and provide full employment and a vital economic boost in these tough times of austerity. This is the kind of long term investment that governments need to be spending on to provide jobs and security as well as protecting our environment. Instead support for renewables is cut and investment in the public good in general is slashed as our government endlessly pursues self-defeating austerity.\nMolly described the German Energiewende Energy Transition that has seen the country rapidly move to an energy sector driven by renewables. As Molly said the South West has even greater potential then most of Germany. It is not that we lack the physical capability to implementing this plan; it is just that we lack the political will. In Germany much of the change has been driven by local community owned and cooperative energy initiatives taking over their local energy networks and implementing the transition themselves.\nThis would be harder to replicate in Britain with our extreme centralisation of power; but it’s clear if we want to have this transition that both our communities and our environment so desperately needs then political change has to happen. Luckily we have the chance this May to elect more Green MPs and contribute to that change. But unfortunately even with a few more Green MPs our political system is so unresponsive to change we’re unlikely to be able to implement the transition quickly enough. That’s why we need strong local and national campaigns making the case for this alternative to austerity and strengthening the hand of any representation we manage to elect. This report is an invaluable tool for winning that argument and gives a blueprint for the kind of change we want and need.\nThis is the bold alternative to austerity the Green Party offers voters this may. This shows our regional part of a Green New Deal that would invest in renewable energy infrastructure and production, a massive program of social house construction, insulation, and investment in our public services and communities to give our economy the fiscal stimulus it needs and to rebalance it in the interests of ordinary people and our planet. As Tony Dyer said:\nInvestment in renewable energy for the South West not only offers the prospect of a safe and secure energy future but also offers the real potential to deliver full employment by creating 122,000 green jobs. This illustrates perfectly the Green Party’s alternative to austerity; supporting substantial investment in the renewable energy sector in order to rebuild and future proof our economy and energy supply.\nThe time for action is long overdue. Fossil fuels will run out eventually and when it does we’ll have to completely change our energy system anyway. The major problem in that scenario is that we need to leave at least 80% of known fossil fuels in the ground if we are to have any chance of avoiding warming the globe by more than 2 degrees and enacting climate catastrophe. We must act now, before it is too late, to save our environment, enrich our economy and communities, and safeguard our long term energy needs.\nAndrew Clarke, Environment, Energy and Strategy Consultant for the Resilience Centre outlined the vital role this report could play in helping pave the way for our transition:\nThis report provides the renewable energy industry in the South West the evidence it needs to demonstrate the benefits that it can bring to the region’s economy and the thousands of new jobs it can create. For too long authorities have been courted by the quick fix of large scale nuclear and dazzled by seemingly extravagant job creation figures.\nLet them now be dazzled by our local, safe and reliable renewable sector and the money it puts back into local people’s pockets in salaries and reducing energy imports.\nDarren Hall (the Green parliamentary candidate tipped to win Bristol West) explained how renewable energy is not only the Green choice, but also the smart economic choice, providing one of the few secure long term investments in our current economic climate:\nBristol is already home to a number of fantastic community energy cooperatives, not only generating power, but also a healthy return on investment for the hundreds of local shareholders who have supported them. Reading this report alongside the Green Party’s pledge to help insulate homes across the UK, shows that we have the ability to dramatically reduce people’s bills, create warm homes, and help combat climate change. It seems to me that only those with vested interests in fossil fuels and nuclear would argue against this.",

The call comes following a recent survey which shows a majority of Labour members support the idea, and the increasingly vocal support for remaining in the EU from the region’s Labour MPs.\nPro-EU Exeter MP, Ben Bradshaw, has said he believes Brexit will never happen and Thangam Debbonaire, MP for Bristol West, commented on Twitter that she will take every opportunity to stop Brexit. Molly, who is Green Party speaker on Brexit, said:\n“It is clear Labour MPs in the South West are engaged in a bit of wishful thinking over Brexit. Hoping it won’t happen or that opportunities will somehow arise to block it is simply not good enough. Especially as the Labour leadership are still mirroring Tory plans for a hard Brexit, involving leaving the Single Market and ending freedom of movement.\n“The best way to steer ourselves away from the Brexit iceberg is to hand the good ship Britannia back to the people. Let them decide whether what is on offer at the end of the Brexit negotiations is better or worse than staying in the EU. I invite all Labour MPs in the South West – and any Tory MPs worried about the course we are on – to join me in supporting a ratification referendum.\n“It is abundantly clear that Labour members have totally rejected a hard Brexit, with only 4% believing that we should leave the Single Market. But given only 9% are against the idea of a second referendum, it is clear that this is the path we should now follow to ensure there is public backing for remaining in the EU.”",

Over 100 Bristol residents currently receive ILF in order to pay for personal assistants and independent living. The costs for local authorities to enable these residents to live independently would increase after the fund is closed.\nRob Telford, Green Party councillor for Ashley ward and vice-chair of the People scrutiny commission (the directorate under which funding for social care falls), said:\n“The Court of Appeal confirmed in November 2013 what most of us understand instinctively– that the Minister for Disabilities failed to consider the duty of government to promote equality of opportunity for disabled people. The ILF is vital for over 100 Bristol residents to be able to live independently – we must act now to safeguard it.”\nTony Dyer, Green Party parliamentary candidate for Bristol South, said:\n“The ILF has enabled thousands of disabled people to live independent lives. The current average weekly payment to ILF recipients is £346, whereas residential care costs are on average £738 per week (and in some cases, £3,500). It simply does not make economic, social or common sense for the Coalition to cut this fund. However, if the fund is cut, Bristol has a chance today to ensure we ring-fence any transferred funding to allow our fellow citizens to continue to live independent lives.”\nCampaign group Disability Rights UK have recently found that a number of local authorities have not put adequate contingency or ringfenced funding in place to compensate for the loss of ILF payments amongst disabled people.1\nThe motion has already received support from Bristol Disability Equality Forum2 and Disabled People Against Cuts.3\nThe Green Party recognises all disabled people, including people with sensory, learning, physical and mental health impairments, should be able to live in the community with appropriate support.4\nFor more information, contact Rob Telford on 07756-355-547\nSources\n1 http://www.disabilityrightsuk.org/news/2014/august/most-councils-will-not-ringfence-ilf-resources\n4 The Green Party’s social welfare policies can be found at: http://policy.greenparty.org.uk/SW (specifically: SW600 onwards)",

This strategy needs to be based on real evidence not marketing hype, and will require investment by central government rather than the continuing cuts promised. How we create such a strategy for Bristol South will be the primary focus of my campaign”\nWelcoming his selection, Southville’s councillor Tess Green said\n“We’re very lucky to have such a good candidate standing in Bristol South. Tony has the skills, the experience and the commitment to change this often neglected constituency for the better”\nNotes:\nBorn on the Hartcliffe estate, the son of a Bedminster-born postman and a Knowle West housewife, Tony is very proud of his Bristol heritage which he has traced back generations. His political views have been shaped to a large degree by his family roots amongst the Bedminster coalminers and Bristol dock workers, and in particular by the experiences of his grandfather who grew up in slum conditions in the Old Market area.\nAfter leaving Hartcliffe school in 1981 to work in the construction industry, Tony later reskilled to join the IT training industry where he worked for a local not-for-profit organisation supporting small business start-ups. Later recruited by the giant US computer company DEC, Tony worked closely with partners such as Microsoft, Cisco, Nokia, and with key clients in the City of London financial services industry and the UK retail industry.\nSince moving back to the Bristol area, Tony has been involved in several grass-roots projects and has written regularly on economic and political issues, particularly for the independent online newspaper Bristol 24-7.\nAged 50, and married with one daughter about to start university, Tony believes the time is right to initiate a fuller, evidence-based debate about real and sustainable alternatives to the policies that have failed south Bristol in the past, and continue to fail it today.",
  "https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_/https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_greens-present-budget-amendments-to-create-more-housing-and-save-money/content_305.html": "menu\nGreen Councillors have proposed measures to Bristol’s budget meeting tomorrow that would create additional council housing and independent housing for adults with social care needs – while saving the council hundreds of thousands of pounds per year.\nCouncillor Martin Fodor proposed an amendment that would increase council housing provision by building additional rooms into existing housing where possible. Extension work could be carried out in ‘void’ periods where housing is empty before being re-let, and be paid for by using underspent money from elsewhere in department budgets.\nExplaining his amendment, Councillor Fodor said:\n“Each year hundreds of Bristol Council houses are returned and re-let to our long waiting lists. We have a broad mix of housing types and this amendment would build an extra room into some suitable houses so the Council’s particularly long waiting times for badly needed larger homes can be brought down just a little. We would use underspent money to pilot the conversion and extension of 10 returned properties in the coming year.\n“This isn’t a new idea, in fact it’s been trialled before and the housing department has said it added very welcome larger homes to the Council’s housing stock. Re-allocating some of the department’s current underspend to carry out more conversion works would help some households in overcrowded, expensive, temporary accommodation. Due to the scale of our housing crisis and long waiting lists, larger families can wait 100s of days for an available property as things stand. This is especially the case in inner City areas such as Ashley, Lawrence Hill and Cabot Wards. I’m glad to move an amendment that would shorten that time just a bit, by expanding the stock of larger homes available.”\nEqualities comments on the amendment by council officers noted that the amendment could be beneficial in areas like Central Bristol, Whitchurch Park and Hartcliffe due to levels of over–crowding and homelessness, as well as Ashley, Lawrence Hill and Cabot wards where residents often have larger families.\nCouncillor Clive Stevens proposed an amendment that would increase funding for housing for adults with disabilities. Buying houses or flats and converting them would allow more adults with disabilities to live independently where appropriate, improving quality of care. By housing more people with care needs independently rather than in residential housing, the amendment would reduce care costs for the council, saving approximately £350,000 per year once completed.\nCouncillor Stevens said:\n“Anyone in business knows that one of the routes to cost savings is to make appropriate investments. It seems the Council is now realising that investing to save – something the Greens have been championing for a while – is key to delivering better value for money from Council tax and Business Rates.”\n“Labour had set aside £4m for this measure and Greens propose increasing it to £6m. This amendment will improve care outcomes, enabling more adults with disabilities to live independently in a home of their own. As well as providing them better care, it will save the Council (and consequently the council tax payer) hundreds of thousands of pounds each and every year.”\nLeader of the Green Group councillor Eleanor Combley said:\n“Together these two amendments would make more social housing available, improve care for adults with disabilities, and save the council hundreds of thousands of pounds per year to boot. I proposed a similar ‘invest to save’ amendment last year and as a result Bristol now has more housing for children in care.\n“Rather than damaging cuts, Green councillors are showing how Bristol Council can invest to save money and improve services. It’s a win win – but of course it has to get approved in tomorrow’s meeting. I hope the majority Labour group votes for it.”\nNotes",

The proposals are for three gas fuelled power stations to form part of the Short Term Operating Reserve (STOR) network to feed the national grid at peak times.\nLocal Councillor Gus Hoyt who represents Ashley ward, including the affected area of St Werburghs, said:\n“Nationally Greens and Tories have completely different visions for future energy policy, so the fact that we agree on this local issue demonstrates how short-sighted and foolhardy the proposal is.”\n“I believe we need to be focussing on sustainable power generation and looking at using less energy in the first place by becoming more efficient. We can also help tackle the need for peak power surges with intelligent design built into the systems incorporating new technologies such as Smart Grids and Tesla batteries.”\nCharles Lucas, the Conservative candidate for Mayor said:\n“Whilst it is essential to meet Bristol’s future energy demands, if any return to 1970’s-style power cuts or rationing is to be avoided, the location of any new generating capacity has to be carefully considered.”\n“Of course, we must keep the lights on but there is also a responsibility to plan these things properly and not simply place gas-fuelled generating stations in the midst of densely populated areas as is being proposed in this case.”\n“I hope that something a little more sensible can be agreed to reflect our much-lauded European Green Capital status.”\nTony Dyer, the Green candidate for Mayor added:\n“I am pleased to see our two parties putting their differences aside to jointly speak out against these proposals. Installing industrial size diesel or gas fuelled generators in the middle of our communities is not an acceptable solution to the problem of short term energy shortages.”\nImage thanks to BS2 Green Space",

He referred to DHL – one of the world’s largest courier companies – who have started the widespread use of cycles to transport goods in Amsterdam.\n“They’re not doing it because they think it’s a particularly nice idea, they’re doing it because it’s economically viable,” he said.\nCycle-based logistics also compares favourably to conventional logistics in terms of space.\nOne medium-sized cargo holder can hold one thousand newspapers. Larger loads can be split up over several cycles, or transported using power-assisted cycles.\n“It’s a very long time coming,” said Gus Hoyt, a Green councillor for Ashley and one of the Mayor of Bristol George Ferguson’s cabinet.\n“It’s very important the council actually puts its weight behind delivering by bike, because we do an awful lot of business.”\nCouncillor Hoyt said that delivering individual councillor’s papers by cycle would be one of the first steps to achieving this. The papers are currently delivered by minibus.\nGreen councillor for Bishopston and former Bristol mayoral candidate Daniella Radice also said that cycle logistics would help change the status of using cycles to take children to and from school.\n“I hope BCLA can impact on all aspects of life: I’ve regularly cycled my children around Bristol in a bike trailer, and I’d like to see more people carrying loads around by bikes to make it part of every day life,” she said.\nFor more information on the Bristol Cycle Logistics Association, or to start using cycle logistics for your business, visit www.bcla.info.",

Today she met Mr Joaquín Almunia, the European Commissioner in charge of state aid to hand him a letter, stating how ‘shocked and disturbed’ she is that concerns raised over the deal have been ignored [2].\nFor several months, the EU has been investigating whether the Hinkley C deal is in breach of EU competition and state aid rules. Greens have always maintained that the contract with EDF, offering a strike price for its electricity of £92.50 per MWh – roughly twice the current wholesale price of power – as well as state credit guarantee of £10bn, are illegal state aids which breach European market rules.\nResponding to the news, Molly Scott Cato said:\n“A decision like this demonstrates why so many British people are sceptical about the EU. The rules on fair competition are perfectly clear but can apparently be ignored when there is a political deal to be made. Agreeing such a huge implicit subsidy for Hinkley will make it impossible for those who generate electricity in a clean and sustainable way to compete. It will destroy thousands of potential jobs in the renewables sector and set back South West innovation in the energies of the future.”\nIn the letter handed to Mr Almunia today, Dr Scott Cato demands a full justification for the decision to approve the deal and calls for the Commission to make public the full evidence on which the judgment was based [3]. She urges constituents in the South West to write to Mr Almunia to express their shock and disappointment, asking him to think again [4].\nThe deal will still require approval from the outgoing EU commissioners, which includes several nuclear sceptics. Greens and a cross-party group of MEPs are now campaigning hard for the contract between the UK government and EDF to be dropped. As well as contravening EU rules, Greens in the Parliament argue the deal threatens the EUs sustainability objectives.\nNotes\n[1] http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/22/hinkley-point-nuclear-reactor-gains-eu-approval\n[2] Photo of Molly meeting briefly with Mr Joaquín Almunia, the European commissioner in charge of state aid and handing him a letter pic.twitter.com/5CoVy04npO\n[3] Letter handed to Mr Almunia: https://db.tt/maSWUTf4\n[4] Contact details for Mr Joaquín Almunia, European commissioner in charge of state aid: http://ec.europa.eu/commission_2010-2014/almunia/contact/commissioner/form_en.htm",

In collaboration with the partners I have mentioned, we will duly get that drafted at our earliest convenience to present to a named person at Government.”\nHowever the Mayor would not commit to support black cultural centres as requested in Cleo’s second question. The Green Councillor said:\n“It is a shame the Mayor wouldn’t commit support to Bristol’s black cultural centres such as the Malcolm X centre, which have been long neglected while the Mayor’s administration spent tens of millions on Colston Hall. A Director at Trinity Arts Centre commented that imagine the work that could be done if these other spaces had received a fraction of the investment – it would genuinely change lives.”\nThe exchange between the Mayor and Councillor Lake can be viewed online in the Member Forum webcast (from 4m 20s).\nThe Mayor’s response suggested Cllr Lake should have met with him instead of raising it at a meeting. However the Green councillor had tried to meet with the Mayor weeks ahead of the meeting. She said:\n“I was taken aback to hear the Mayor suggest I hadn’t tried to meet him. I had tried to set up a meeting with him just two weeks before and during my time as Lord Mayor multiple attempts to meet with him were cancelled.”\nAt a Bristol Council meeting on Tuesday 7 July, Green Councillor Cleo Lake, activist and former Lord Mayor, will ask the city’s Labour Mayor to lobby the government to set up a commission to acknowledge, apologise and instigate reparations for the UK’s role in the Transatlantic Traffic in Enslaved Africans.\nCouncillor Lake was a founder member of the Countering Colston activist group spearheading calls in recent years to dismantle the public celebration of people trafficker and Maangamizi perpetrator, Edward Colston. The Green councillor submitted a motion to the council meeting to call for the council to take on various actions in response to the Black Lives Matter movement and the need for holistic reparatory justice. As Cleo’s motion is unlikely to be heard at the meeting, she is instead asking the Mayor directly to look at her key demands which are supported by members of the Afrikan Connections Consortium and the Stop The Maangamizi Campaign.\nCleo’s question asks the Mayor to write to the Prime Minister to request “that the UK government immediately establishes an All-Party Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry for Truth & Reparatory Justice to acknowledge, apologise and instigate reparations for the Transatlantic Traffic in Enslaved Africans”.\nExplaining her question to the Mayor, Cleo said:\n“This isn’t just about monetary compensation, it goes much wider than that and is a movement that has existed for centuries, ever since the first transgressions of our humanity as African heritage people. The first stop is an acknowledgement by the British state that what happened was wrong and a formal apology should follow – this is an essential step to repair as so far our experiences of historic and ongoing wrongs have been denied. We need an active commitment to prevent further injustice.\n“I know this will be a controversial subject for some but it’s a debate we need to have and I very much hope the Mayor will take this matter to the government.”\nAs well as lobbying the government to set up a commission, Councillor Lake will ask Marvin Rees what strategy the Council has “to protect and support long-standing black-led cultural institutions of the city that continue to be severely underfunded and under resourced”. Her question notes that institutions in Bristol like the Malcolm X Centre, the Kuumba Centre and the Rastafari Cultural Centre have been under-funded and under-resourced while the Council spent over £10 million restoring what was formerly known as Colston Hall.\nCleo said:\n“The Malcolm X Centre, Kuumba Centre, Docklands, Rastafari Cultural Centre have been there for me my whole life and throughout the lives of my children, my community and others. They have served us in a way that other institutions in the city cannot. They have held deep and meaningful cultural activities over generations, offered solace, entertainment, education and have a first-hand understanding of our experiences in a way that is genuine and necessary. They are spaces where many of us can be ourselves, they are safe spaces and yet they are also spaces which are outward facing serving a wide demographic. But it feels like for decades that these spaces haven’t mattered, that our way of being isn’t good enough, something that I know other community centres have also battled with across the city for years.\n“I hope to see a commitment from the Mayor that these institutions will be supported and protected. I do note the recent securing of a 25 year lease for the Malcolm X Centre from the Council which was a positive step forward. If the Mayor believes the council cannot afford to financially support any of these centres, then I’d suggest that he could use his influence with the One City partners or if agreed by these centres, the Merchant Venturers to secure funding. Everything is possible if only the will is present. I would like to acknowledge all the volunteers and Black South West Network for their support and efforts to improve the situation for our black led institutions.”\nNotes\nYou can find Councillor Lake’s motion to Full Council in the agenda reports pack at https://democracy.bristol.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=142&MId=8367&Ver=4.\nCouncillor Lake’s Member Forum questions to the Mayor:\nIn the occasion that we do not get to the Reparations Motion that I have carefully crafted and submitted, I ask the following questions:\n1. As called for by leading activists and academics with regards to reparatory justice, can the Mayor write to the Prime Minister to request that the UK government immediately establishes an All-Party Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry for Truth & Reparatory Justice to acknowledge, apologise and instigate reparations for the Transatlantic Traffic in Enslaved Africans (TTEA) the experience and extent of which is further understood by campaigners as the Maangamizi. Stop the Maangamizi Campaign: awbs://stopthemaangamizi.com/\n2. Amidst the Black Lives Matter movement which indeed the council despite its decades of institutional racism has adopted as a slogan adorned as a footer on emails, I want to ask the Mayor what strategy and consideration is in place to protect and support long-standing black-led cultural institutions of the city that continue to be severely underfunded and under resourced. How can the council support them to thrive, either through direct council intervention or by brokering relationships with institutions in the city?\nSuch institutions must include the Malcolm X Centre, the Kuumba Centre, the Docklands Settlement and the Rastafari Cultural Centre. This question is not a new one I think you will find a similar question in the Cabinet archives from 2016 when I challenged the reality of the Council signing off over 10 million pounds (that amount now increased) to the Hall formerly named Colston, when the cultural hubs in the Black Community seemed not even on the councils radar less still did not receive any notable funding and still haven’t. It wasn’t fair then and it isn’t fair now.",

In response, the Mayor said the letter was simply a factual response ‘commenting on’ elements of the airport’s expansion plans such as the car parking changes.\nThe official letter, (see below) sent by Marvin Rees and Kye Dudd to North Somerset in June 2019, states that Bristol Council “supports the important role the airport plays in connecting the West of England and wider South West to global destinations” and repeats approvingly the airport’s claims regarding positive economic impacts. Following this, Councillor Clarke asked the Mayor several times to state his own position on the airport’s expansion, but the Mayor refused to answer; the third occasion he has done so after being asked by Green councillors.\nThe Mayor’s support for airport expansion, which would see passenger numbers increase from the current 8.6 million per year to 12 million and then to 20 million and cause a significant increase in pollution, noise and congestion was initially based on a report by the airport listing the supposed economic benefits. The respected think-tank New Economics Foundation, were commissioned to examine the airport’s report and concluded starkly that it “significantly overstated” the economic benefits.\nCouncillor Clarke states “We are approaching decision making time in this application. A lot has changed since the Mayor and Cllr. Kye Dudd wrote their letter of support for the expansion in April last year: multiple warnings from scientists, floods around the world and of course the ongoing fires in Australia. This is possibly the biggest decision that this region will take in the battle against climate change – the carbon emissions from the expansion alone are nearly the same as the whole of Bristol’s emissions. I appeal to Marvin Rees to show leadership in the face of the Climate Emergency he has declared, retract his support, and write a letter of objection to the airport’s plans.”\nComment on Bristol Airport’s planning application below from Marvin Rees and Kye Dudd:",

Later, they lived out the fantasy of two-party politics, blissfully unaware that things have changed. At the University of Bristol, a student hustings showed a new reality. Away from the glare of studio lights, multiple parties now vie for a place in parliament, and nowhere is this more the case than in Bristol West. Here, the Green Party’s Darren Hall is in pole position to overtake the sitting Lib Dem MP, Stephen Williams. With one of the largest student populations of any UK constituency, student concerns are at the forefront of this election.\nIn any constituency where the Lib Dems stand, the party’s capitulation to their Tory partners on the issue of student fees casts a dark shadow. Unsurprisingly, one of the first questions asked concerned the principle of free education. Green Party candidate Darren Hall was the only candidate to back the abolition of tuition fees. Education, he said, ‘is at the heart of society’. It is ‘how we make progress’, and there should be access to education for everyone. To achieve this, there can be no fees. The system is untenable. The debt accrued will never be paid back in full. And alternatives exist. The Czech Republic has as many students as the UK, but every single one of them studies for free. If they can afford it, Darren asked, why can’t we?\nOn the topic of the exploitation of student workers, Darren Hall was the only candidate to unambiguously call for a ban on zero-hour contracts.This is Green Party policy.The Labour candidate, Thangam Debbonaire, gave an account of her own party’s policy. It promises only act on ‘exploitative’ zero-hour contracts. But this will mitigate only the worst excesses.Labour makes no commitment to banning zero-hour contracts full stop.\nLetting agency fees are a big issue for student renters. ‘The market in letting agency fees is a fringe opportunity for profit’, suggested Darren, whose party supports the Ethical Letting Charter. To respond to what he calls a ‘wider crisis’ in housing, Darren offered some powerful policy proposals to address the problems faced by renters. He championed continental-style rent controls, with longer tenancies and a limit on rental price increases. The other candidates were unable to suggest anything as radical. Lib Dem Stephen Williams is in favour of letting agency fees,voting against their regulation in Parliament. Labour’s Thangam Debbonaire highlighted her party’s commitment to banning revenge evictions, but she did not seem to realise thatthis has already happened under the current government, after lobbying by homelessness charity Shelter. Replying to a later question, Darren pointed to the links between homelessness with the Tory-Lib Dem housing sanctions. The Green Party would get rid of the bedroom tax- for which Stephen Williams, the Lib Dem candidate,voted strongly in favour.\nThe sharpest intake of breath of the night came with a question from the floor directed at the Lib Dem candidate Stephen Williams. The question referred to a parliamentary vote on 23rd February 2015. Williams voted against amending the Official Secrets Act to protect those who assist inquiries into institutional child abuse. This question was specifically addressed at Stephen, but he used his response time to address other questions and avoided answering this one.\nOne of the biggest cheers of the night was for an alternative political system. Responding to a question on the voting age, the Green candidate argued that although he thought the voting age should be lowered, broader changes are needed, and that democratic failure is less about voter age than the political system itself. Darren was the only candidate to call for a system of Proportional Representation. This was fitting for a constituency where the binary bunfight of two-party politics is a thing of the past. Back in London, Dave and Ed played their part in a nostalgic battlefield recreation. In Bristol West however, the election campaign is well underway, and the Labour-Tory faceoff is nowhere to be seen.",
  "https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_/https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_greens-help-deliver-council-motion-on-single-use-drinking-cups/content_481.html": "menu\nBristol Green councillors say they are delighted after a Full Council motion they worked on to address the environmental impact of ‘single use’ drinking cups has passed with cross party support. The motion was moved by Lib Dem Councillor Clare Campion-Smith with input from Green councillors Fi Hance and Martin Fodor. It calls on Bristol’s Labour Mayor to introduce a small charge on non-recyclable drinking cups provided at City Hall and other venues controlled by the Council, as well as lobbying central government for a charge at the national level which could be similar to the successful charge on plastic bags introduced in October 2015.\n‘Single-use’ plastics are so-called because they either cannot or are not designed to be recycled. These are things like plastic film wraps, straws, coffee stirrers, soda and water bottles and most food packaging. Most coffee cups sold in the UK are waterproofed by fusing the card with a plastic membrane which cannot then be extracted at most recycling plants. This means the coffee cups also take an extremely long time to biodegrade – as much as 30 years according to experts – creating a mountain of waste for future generations.\nGreen councillors contributed some changes to the Lib Dem motion which were agreed the day before the Full Council meeting. These included: Calling on the mayor to ensure all outlets on Council land offer reusable coffee cups for sale, to request all council contractors to switch to fully recyclable drinks cups, and to ensure cups are only sold with non-black plastic lids (as in practice black plastic is not recyclable).\nCouncillor Martin Fodor, who started a petition on the Bristol City Council website to ban single use plastics, said “Anyone who saw Blue Planet on Sunday evening would find it impossible to deny the evidence of the damage single use plastics are doing to our environment. While recyclable and reusable drinking cups exist there is no excuse for us to keep drinking coffee out of these disposable cups and tossing them away each time. At the moment we throw away a whopping 2.5 billion coffee cups a year – twenty five thousand tonnes of waste which mostly goes into landfill. Use of reusable – or at least recyclable – drinking cups has to be encouraged through gentle nudges like this.”\nThe Green campaign and petition to ban single use, disposable plastics in Bristol City Council was supported by the party’s co-leader and Green MP Caroline Lucas when she came to visit Bristol in October.\n(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39MZU1lvLfY)\nCaroline said: “There’s a huge amount [Bristol City Council] could be doing in terms of their own procurement policies, in terms of the conditions they put on licensing when other big events are coming to the city. There’s no reason that there should be plastic bottles in Council meetings, in our schools, or in other Council buildings.”\nCouncillor Fi Hance, former Green Cabinet Member said “Thanks are due to the Lib Dem councillors who allowed us to contribute to writing this motion without having to go through the lengthy amendment process in Full Council – it is an excellent, common sense green idea and I’m delighted it has passed. During my time in Cabinet I set in motion the beginning stages of a council-wide curb on single use plastics and this is a really good first step towards that. Following this motion passing with cross party support I hope to see action from the Mayor on this soon.”",

The Bush (situated in Hengrove) is an overnight short break facility for disabled children, providing respite care for parents and guardians with profoundly disabled children. A Cabinet report1 on short breaks will be considered by the Mayor, and a grass roots campaign by the families affected aims to halt the closure of the Bush beds2.\nCouncil officials say that money freed up by closing five beds will give them the opportunity to diversify the type of respite care that can be offered to parents and young people. The council’s data shows that the Bush is at 80% capacity, but officers argue it would be unfeasible just to close 2 of the 10 beds.\nRob Telford, Green councillor for Ashley and vice-chair of the People scrutiny commission where the report was initially heard said: “This is a resident-led campaign. We have a number of worried parents who rely on the Bush for vital respite care for their profoundly disabled children. We know that all council services need improvement, but all the information we have been given has not convinced us that removing five beds is going to be a constructive change for these families, who care passionately about the Bush and its high level of care.”\nGus Hoyt, Green councillor for Ashley and Assistant Mayor for Neighbourhoodsadded: “The parents who use the Bush have the greatest need. The proposed cut in provision is a severe concern for them as their children are very comfortable with the current arrangement and don’t approach change easily.”\nThe Green Party is committed to respite care breaks and sees them as vital. They ensure carers get the time we all need to rest from work. The Green Party also recognises that breaks enable carers to go on caring. Many respite and day care centres have been closed in recent years, and the buildings sold to the private sector, in order that financial savings be realized by health and social services departments. The Green Party will support existing respite centres and will fund the replacement of respite care centres where they are needed.3\nNotes\n1 The Cabinet report can be found at: https://www.bristol.gov.uk/committee/2014/ua/ua000/1007_5.pdf\n2 More information on the grass roots campaign can be found at: http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/Bush-residential-centre-provides-taste-normal/story-21071781-detail/story.html\n3 More information on the Green Party’s social welfare policies can be found at:http://policy.greenparty.org.uk/sw.html#SW902",

The Green Party is the only political Party fully committed to the renationalisation of the railways, arguing it would save taxpayers more than £1 billion a year and lead to lower fares and better services.\nThe Green Party has long campaigned for the renationalisation of the railways. Green Party MP, Caroline Lucas, has recently launched a Private Member’s Bill in parliament calling for the rail network to be brought back into public ownership step by step as franchises expire, or private companies break the terms of their franchise agreements [1].\nGreens, together with the RMT Union and campaign and passenger groups, point to the success of the East Coast Mainline which was taken into public control in 2009 after the private franchise company failed to operate it efficiently or viably. The Directly Operated Railways Company has delivered £600 million to the Treasury, increased passenger numbers, improved efficiency and consistently scored highly in surveys on passenger satisfaction [2].\nFirst Group has recently secured a multi-million pound extension of their franchise until 2015[3]. Despite the lucrative deal, the company is currently embroiled in a dispute with the RMT over low pay and zero hours contracts for cleaning staff [4].\nAndrew Bell, a long-time transport campaigner and prospective Green councillor in Exeter, said:\n“The Green Party in the South West is calling time on the First Group. Privatised rail has been a disaster for passengers, the tax payer and for many of those working for the private operating companies. The franchise model may be great for shareholders but terrible for passengers who have to put up with some of the highest fares in Europe and for that get overcrowded trains and unreliable services. Since privatisation, the cost of train travel has risen by 23% in real terms, and the drain on the public purse has more than doubled. In addition these companies treat some of their employees or subcontracted employees with contempt. We echo the RMT’s call for a Living Wage and the ending of zero hours contracts for all employees working for the First Great Western Franchise.”\nThe call for renationalisation comes at a time when a new set of regulations is being proposed by the EU which could impose a model of fragmentation and privatisation similar to the model currently applied in the UK [5].\nProfessor Molly Scott Cato, Green Party lead candidate in the South West for next year’s European elections, said:\n“How ironic that at a time when the idea of renationalisation has never been more popular with the British public [6], the European Commission is seeking to impose a failed model of privatisation on domestic rail passenger services in EU member states. Greens in the European Parliament will fight hard against any moves to remove the freedom for countries to choose which way they want to run their passenger rail services. For Greens in the UK that means, unequivocally, public ownership of our railways.”\nNotes\n[1] Lucas launches Bill to bring railways into public hands http://greenparty.org.uk/news/2013/10/18/lucas-launches-bill-to-bring-railways-into-public-hands/\nCaroline Lucas Railways Bill: http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/2013-2014/0081/14081.pdf\n[2] Petition to keep East Coast Mainline in public ownership and information on the success of the publicly owned franchise: http://you.38degrees.org.uk/petitions/keep-east-coast-public\n[3] Passenger Voice: http://email.passengerfocus.org.uk/passengerfocuslz/lz.aspx?p1=05043S117209&CC=&p=4&cID=0&cValue=1\n[4] First Great Western Mitie cleaners to strike again: http://www.rmt.org.uk/news/first-great-western-mitie-cleaners-to-strike-again/\n[5] A survey in 2009 found that as many as 70% of the British public would support re-nationalisation of the railways.

Genuine private investment makes an insignificant contribution to the railways, representing about one per cent of the total money that goes into the railway each year.

People didn’t vote to lose free trade with our European neighbours or to turn our country into Europe’s biggest tax haven.\n“It is shameful that Labour, as the ‘official opposition’, have colluded with the Tories on this extreme Brexit without securing any amendments on protecting workers’ rights or our environment. Indeed, Labour have negotiated no safeguards at all and seem oblivious to the damage a hard Brexit will cause.\n“Greens are clear on the need for a ratification referendum at the end of the two-year Article 50 process, to give people the final say on the deal negotiated between the UK and the EU. These figures add weight to the need to secure that referendum. People are beginning to understand the full implications of leaving the EU and realising it doesn’t look at all good.\n“If taking back control means anything it should mean that we all have a right to think again when we see what Brexit really means rather than what we were told it meant during the referendum campaign.”\nThe survey also revealed that a slim majority of those in Bristol (51 per cent) would like to have a second referendum and 56 per cent believe that the UK will break up within a decade, of as a result of Brexit.",

A statement says the event “will convene the various strands of the climate emergency and sustainability space – activists, problem-holders and solution providers – in order to co-design concrete solutions for genuine impact.” The Club of Rome is an international organisation founded in 1968 that consists of current and former world leaders, UN representatives, government officials, experts and business leaders from around the globe. In 1972 it commissioned a well-known report into the limits to growth.\nCouncillor Denyer proposed the initial climate emergency motion at a Bristol Council meeting in November 2018 – it called on the Council to declare a climate emergency and set a target for Bristol to achieve carbon neutrality by 2030, an advance of 20 years on the original objective. Since then over 100 UK local authorities and the London Assembly have followed suit and passed similar motions. The UK parliament also passed a motion on the subject on May 1 2019.\nHowever, in her talk at the international event Cllr Denyer is expected to press for more action from policymakers, calling on politicians from other parties to follow their declarations with ambitious and effective action rather than continuing to pursue policies destructive to the climate.\nCarla said:\n“I am delighted that so many Councils followed my lead in declaring a Climate Emergency. But clearly a declaration on its own is not enough – it is only meaningful if it is followed up with urgent and sustained action. I am worried there is a very real risk of this not happening. Many of the politicians that have made these declarations have not reflected it in their policies and actions, indeed they have pursued policies that are at direct odds with addressing the emergency. In the last few months we have seen Labour, Lib Dem and Conservative politicians granting permission for a new coal mine in Cumbria and supporting airport expansions across the country.\n“Our society has made huge progress in the last 9 months – political leaders of all stripes have shown they are ready to describe the problem honestly, but now we need to find the political will to solve the problem. I hope this London Climate Action Week will be the time that they step up to the challenge.”\nPhoto credit @JonCraig_Photos",

After years of campaigning against air pollution and passing a successful council motion in 2016 which laid the foundations for the administration’s current approach, Green Councillors welcomed the item at Cabinet and called on the administration to take effective action.\nA supporting report submitted to cabinet outlines five separate options for a Clean Air Zone, including options for a charging zone on cars and other vehicles. These options will be examined in a feasibility study over the course of the year.\nGreen councillor Fi Hance, who led the Council’s clean air project during her time as a Green Cabinet Member, submitted a statement to cabinet in support of the clean air plan. She said:\n“Far too many people in our most deprived communities are suffering the ill effects of our dirty air. As the report points out, in some areas, over 1 in 10 of early deaths can be attributed to air pollution, along with many more numbers suffering from poor health. Inner city residents have lower car ownership but suffer far more health impacts from the vehicles causing illegal and harmful air – we owe them some respite from toxic air for which they are not responsible.”\nThe report submitted to cabinet notes that 72% of people in Bristol consider air pollution and traffic pollution to be ‘a problem’ or ‘a serious problem’ in their neighbourhoods and lists the known health impacts of air pollution which include low birth weight of babies, impaired lung development in small children, and acute respiratory problems and increased risk of heart disease among adults and the elderly. Air quality monitoring points around Bristol routinely record levels of air pollution far above legal limits, particularly in city centre locations such as Rupert Street, Colston Avenue and Anchor Road.\nGroup leader Councillor Eleanor Combley said:\n“It’s great to see that the Green motion, which gained cross party support in a Council meeting back in November 2016, has kept Bristol’s illegal air quality high on the Council’s agenda. As our Green Cabinet member, Fi Hance did a fantastic job chairing the Mayor’s Air Quality Working Group, developing ideas for how to tackle the issue, and I want to thank her for all the hard work that she put in to lead to these proposals. This is also a victory for the thousands of people who supported our #LetBristolBreathe campaign and signed the petition calling for action.\n“As the research shows, hundreds of lives are needlessly being cut short from dangerous levels of air pollution in Bristol, and it’s those in deprived areas of the city who are worst affected. Looking ahead, I hope the Mayor will not shy away from bold and effective action to protect the lives and health of Bristolians.”\nBackground:\n– It is a legal requirement for Bristol City Council to take action to bring air pollution levels below the legal limit as soon as possible, as noted in the cabinet report which notes that: “The City Council has been directed by Government to develop plans by 31st December 2018 to achieve compliance with the Limit Value and Objective in the shortest possible time.”\n– According to the report, the main source of nitrogen dioxide pollution in Bristol “is road traffic; with diesel cars the largest source responsible for 40% of the emissions.”\n– Green councillors have been pushing for action on clean air from the Council since as far back as 1989. In 2016 they passed a successful council motion which laid the foundations for the administration’s current work on air quality.\n– Full text of statement by Cllr Hance is below:\nStatement to Cabinet – Agenda Item 8 – Improving Public Health – A Clean Air Plan for Bristol – Cllr Fi Hance\nOn behalf of the Green group of councillors, I’d like to welcome this report which acknowledges the severity of the problem of air pollution in Bristol and the significant concern that the issue is for a many of the city’s residents. Greens in Bristol have been calling for action on this since as far back as the late 80s so it is very exciting to see plans reaching this late stage.\nFrom my time working on this in Cabinet I’m very much aware that this report reflects an enormous amount of hard work by many officers, particularly Alex Minshull and Kathy Derrick who have put in many hours, dealing with a situation in which the goalposts have not so much moved as galloped across the pitch on a number of occasions. We are fortunate to have such dedicated staff.\nWe should not forget, however, that whilst the options outlined here are significant, and will require a considerable amount of political courage to implement, they are only part of the picture. Shifting a culture of car dependency and entitlement is not easy and we must continue to lobby government for adequate resourcing to promote active travel, improved public transport and a Clean Air Act. Residents will also expect the council to be seeking strategic support from WECA to ensure more substantial and sustained investment in walking and cycling to create viable, attractive alternatives.’\nFar too many people in our most deprived communities are suffering the ill effects of our dirty air.

As with other demos, this strike is part of a coordinated global action – the organisers say at least 106 other places in the UK will be taking part. Green councillors in Bristol, who have repeatedly challenged the expansion of Bristol Airport, welcomed the news.\nThe organisers of the climate strike have set up a Facebook event which states:\n“Despite both declaring a Climate Emergency, Bristol and North Somerset Council are still forging ahead with their plans of an airport expansion, which will have devastating impacts on the climate. With the clock ticking towards the point of no return WE WILL NOT STAND FOR THIS.”\nAlthough Bristol City Council unanimously passed the Greens’ Climate Emergency motion in November 2018, making Bristol the first UK city to do so, the city’s Labour Mayor continues to support Bristol Airport’s expansion plans, which will see an increase of 4 million passengers and 23,600 extra flights per year.\nAt an event in Bristol on May 20, Green councillor for Southville Steve Clarke met with Green MP Caroline Lucas and talked to her about the airport expansion plans and youth climate strike.\nFull post at: https://www.facebook.com/bristolgreenparty/videos/787513631645469/\nCouncillor Clarke said:\n“It’s fantastic news that the Youth Climate strike are raising this issue. These young people are showing the rest of us what needs to be done – we have to listen to them before it’s too late. George Monbiot recently described Bristol Airport’s expansion as a ‘gun pointed at the heart of the planet’ and he’s absolutely right. We know from the IPCC report that humanity has about a dozen years to radically alter our economy and society in order to have a chance at preventing runaway climate change. Global warming over 3C will quite literally lead to millions of deaths and forever change animal life as we know it.\n“What politicians like Bristol’s Labour Mayor don’t seem to grasp is that this climate emergency – that he voted for at the Council – means business as usual has to stop. The scale of the challenge we’re facing means we have to put our children’s and grandchildren’s futures ahead of the tired pursuit of growth at all costs. Marvin Rees and the leaders of all our neighbouring local authorities need to publically oppose the expansion of Bristol Airport.”\nLily, 16, one of the organisers of the Youth Strike, said:\n“Most importantly we believe that expansion is NOT compatible with the declaration of a climate emergency, in which Bristol is leading the way. To remain in a state of emergency, all decisions (particularly future planning decisions) need to be taken with reducing the impact of climate change as the priority.”\n“Increasing flights from 8 million to 12 million passengers will directly increase CO2 emissions and aggravate the situation. We respect that Marvin Rees is trying to provide jobs for Bristol residents but we believe that this can be done with a focus on sustainable, green jobs. The fight against climate change will open up more opportunities in this sector. As young people we are constantly left out of this debate, when issues like Bristol Airport will affect us most of all. We strike to demand a say in the city we inherit, one which we believe should be reducing their contributions towards the mass extinction we are facing.”\nGreen MP Caroline Lucas said:\n“How on earth anyone could think this is compatible with declaring a Climate Emergency is frankly unbelievable. I think Bristol Airport is going to be a really important test case to demonstrate that if you’ve declared a climate emergency that means you have to start doing things differently – you don’t continue with business as usual.”\n“I was really pleased that some of the young people at the climate strikes have prioritised this as an issue. Young people get it – so it’s quite extraordinary that the politicians who are supposed to be making laws on their behalf somehow still don’t get it”",

Carla said: “I will be pushing for a People’s Vote on the Brexit deal, and will campaign hard for the UK to remain in the EU. I will lead on real action to tackle the Climate Emergency, and I will not rest until we have reversed austerity – properly, not the misleading ‘austerity is over’ sham the Tories are trying to sell us.”\nThe launch took place on the same day as the Climate Strike on Friday at a packed College Green where thousands of Bristol residents called for emergency action to halt and reverse climate change. Carla was heavily critical of other political parties, saying; “The Conservatives have let us down in every conceivable area of public life and the sooner they are out of government the better.”\n“Labour politicians continue to claim they understand the climate emergency issue while backing airport expansion, investing employee pensions in fossil fuels, and inviting BP and Heathrow airport to speak at their party conference. Labour clearly don’t get it.”\nThe Green Party is now the clear frontrunner in Bristol as the countdown continues to the next elections, after the party saw spectacular results in the 2019 EU election, receiving 35% of the vote across the city. This was 17,606 votes clear of the nearest contender and more than double the Labour vote – a fall in vote share which was widely attributed to Labour’s shifting and ambiguous national policy on Brexit [2]. The Green Party are the main contenders in Bristol West, which is historically a swing seat. It has been held by Labour and the Lib Dems within the last five years, and the Greens came a close second in 2015 [3].\nGreen Party peer Natalie Bennett said: “Bristol West is a key target seat for us. It’s an area where people can vote Green knowing they don’t have to vote tactically because there’s no chance of the Conservatives winning. With the current Labour MP facing potential deselection and under fire from Corbyn supporters within her own party, they’ve completely lost their momentum. We have a fantastic candidate who’s led on the Climate Emergency, who’s consistent on Brexit, and who’s held the council to account and delivered real, tangible change for the most vulnerable people in the city. It’s time for a new politics. Carla can win.”\nThe Green Party has chosen candidates for all four seats in Bristol in the event of a snap General Election. Tony Dyer (Bristol South), Conan Connolly (Bristol East) and Heather Mack (Bristol North West) have also announced their candidacies.\nNotes:\n[1] In 2018 Carla Denyer proposed the first Climate Emergency motion in Europe, committing Bristol to go carbon neutral by 2030. This started a wave of similar motions across the country, with over 200 local authorities, plus the UK Parliament and Scottish and Welsh governments, having now declared a Climate Emergency. https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/bristol-climate-emergency-carbon-neutral-2219477\n[2] European election results for Bristol city region https://live-bcpcouncil-bournemouth.cloud.contensis.com/Council-and-Democratic/Consultation-And-Research/Consultations-and-research-docs/EU-elections-regional-results-23-May-2019-002.pdf\n[3] Bristol West constituency was held between 2010 and 2015 by Stephen Williams (Liberal Democrat).

They site a string of failures which demonstrate his inability to fulfill his role as head of the Department for Environment Food & Rural Affairs (Defra), a department whose remit is to ‘improve the environment and safeguard animal and plant health’ [1].\nSouth West Greens say Mr Patterson’s handling of the badger cull was ‘inept’ and branded the whole policy a failure. They say the cull has divided rural communities while bovine TB continues to devastate livestock and farmers’ livelihoods.\nGreens also accuse the beleaguered minister of “incredible complacency” over climate change after new figures revealed that Defra will spend just £17.2m on domestic ‘climate change initiatives’ this financial year, a 41 per cent decline on the previous 12 months [2].\nLast week, Mr Paterson commented that he wanted to see fracking ‘all over rural parts of the UK’ [3], described by South West Greens as totally irresponsible and an insult to rural communities.\nThe final straw for the Greens was the Environment Secretary’s abortive visit to communities in flood-hit Somerset in which he spoke to the cameras but ignored local people affected by the floods [4].\nDr Molly Scott Cato, lead South West Green Party European candidate said:\n“Paterson seems to have no idea what the environment means or what it means to be the minister for it. People may view his comments about badgers ‘moving goalposts’ or anti-fracking campaigners winning the arguments because of their ‘exciting clothes and banners’ as the lines of a stand-up comic. Well, perhaps he would do better as a comedian than Environment Secretary because these issues are far from a laughing matter.”\n“Rather than protecting the natural world he only visits the countryside to look for opportunities to exploit and profit from it. Since he is unconvinced by the science behind climate change he is unlikely to be the right person to develop policies to address this most significant problem we face; climate change goes to the heart of the flood problems afflicting communities living in the Somerset Levels.”\nLast September Dr Scott Cato was involved in a spat with Owen Patterson, who had accused anti-fracking protestors of scaremongering [5]. The following month the BBC reported him calling opponents of genetically modified rice ‘wicked’ and blaming them for child blindness [6].\nDr Scott Cato concluded:\n“From genetic modification to fracking, from bovine TB to flooding, Owen Paterson has let down the British people and I am calling for David Cameron to replace him with somebody who truly understands the Environment Secretary brief.”\nNotes\n[1] Defra website: what we do: https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-environment-food-rural-affairs\n[2] Guardian: Owen Paterson angers locals on visit to flooded Somerset Levels http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jan/27/owen-paterson-angers-locals-visit-flooded-somerset-levels\n[3] Western Morning News: http://www.westernmorningnews.co.uk/Owen-Paterson-wants-fracking-8216-rural-parts-UK/story-20513681-detail/story.html#ixzz2rsOgRtRa\n[4] http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jan/27/owen-paterson-angers-locals-visit-flooded-somerset-levels Note: Paterson’s suggestion of an unspecified plan to deal with the floods was immediately overruled by the Prime Minister’s call for dredging as soon as practicable.

Almost half of main applicants currently waiting for an initial decision on their asylum claim have been waiting for over six months.\nAsylum seeker support allowance is currently just £5.39 per day, so with a ban on working this forces asylum seekers to live in poverty.\nThe Lift the Ban campaign, a coalition of charities, councils, unions, and community organisations, are working to change this. There is a petition to Bristol City Council calling on it to join the campaign, and meanwhile to do more to support asylum seekers that are forced into destitution by the ban.\nThe Green Party of England and Wales are a long-time supporter of the campaign, and in Bristol, Green councillors are working with Student Action for Refugees (STAR).\nLeader of the Green group of councillors, Eleanor Combley, proposed a motion on the issue to Bristol City Council. She said:\n“This ban is cruel and unnecessary, forcing people to live in poverty and dependence, making it harder for them to integrate and to contribute to our society, and meaning that all of us miss out on the contribution they could be making through their work. No wonder that, in recent surveys, 71% of the British population support lifting the ban on asylum seekers working after 6 months.”\nUnfortunately the motion is unlikely to be debated this month due to time constraints, so Cllr Combley has also submitted a question directly to the Mayor asking him to back the campaign, rather than waiting for the next Council meeting to debate it.\nCllr Combley explains:\n“I proposed the motion because I am keen for Bristol to lead on this issue. However the Mayor does not need to wait for permission from Full Council. If he wants to he could sign the Council up to join the coalition today.

Above this, the risks to humanity of floods, droughts, extreme heat and poverty become much greater, impacting on hundreds of millions more people.(2) The motion text notes the progress already made by Bristol Council, and argues that as a former European Green Capital, Bristol has an important role to play in leading the UK in reducing carbon emissions as fast as possible. It asks the city’s Mayor Marvin Rees to declare a Climate Emergency and pledge to make Bristol carbon neutral by 2030 (bringing forward the current target by 20 years), call on national government for more powers and resources to support this, work with partners in Bristol and other governments both in the UK and nationally to prevent climate change above 1.5°C, and to report back in six months on the actions that will be taken to address the emergency.\nCouncillor Denyer said:\n“This is a fantastic day for Bristol and I’m delighted the Council will be bringing forward its target for carbon neutrality to 2030. The IPCC report made it clear that time to preserve Earth as we know it is running out. We can’t wait for the UN or national governments to negotiate when we have just 12 years to act – we have to show how it’s done and commit to ambitious action at the level of cities, which we did this evening.\n“I’m grateful to my colleagues in the Green Group, who supported me in bringing this motion to council and leading the other political groups in the right direction, to those councillors from other parties who saw the importance of taking action, and to the public who did a fantastic job submitting statements and emailing their councillors in support of this motion. Thanks to all of you, Bristol is now leading the rest of the UK on climate change.”\nCouncillor Steve Clarke, who seconded the motion, said he was overjoyed by the outcome and added:\n“The next step is to ensure that this evening’s commitments are followed by ambitious action. Over the coming years, Greens will continue to hold Bristol Council to account on today’s decision, no matter what party is in power. We know that 2030 is a big commitment for the city and to meet this target an awareness of carbon emissions will have to factor into every decision the Council takes. We look forward to the Mayor reporting back to us in 6 months on what action he will take.”\nBackground:\n– Insects and plants were almost twice as likely to lose half their habitat at 2°C compared with 1.5°C warming\n– Coral populations would be wiped out at 2°C warming but more than 10% would have a chance of surviving at the lower temperature\n– Global fish stocks would lose 3 million tonnes at 2°C, twice the decline of 1.5°C, due to lower oxygen levels and greater acidity in the ocean\n– Hundreds of millions more people, particularly in less developed countries, would be at risk of climate-related poverty with a 2°C increase\n– The global population exposed to water stress would be 50% lower with 1.5°C warming\n– At current levels, the world is on course for 3°C of warming",

He said:\n“This is a fantastic result of hard work and real co-operation amongst campaigners and residents. It is a real ‘David and Goliath’ story as, on the one side is a £200 billion Canadian pension fund who own the airport, and on the other is a crowd-funded campaign and lots of hard work by ordinary but committed people.”\nPress release: Bristol Airport: Response to North Somerset Council Planning Committee’s rejection of the expansion of Bristol Airport.\nEnvironmental campaigners and local residents were delighted at the decision of the North Somerset Planning and Regulatory Committee to turn down Bristol Airport’s plans to expand to 12 million passengers a year. This would have involved over 20,000 extra flights, severe road congestion, damaging noise pollution and massive extra amounts of carbon being emitted into the atmosphere.\nAt a tense meeting held at Weston Town Hall on Monday night (10th February), the 27 decision-making councillors heard from a variety of environmental and legal experts and decided that to agree to the expansion of the airport was completely incompatible with their recent declaration of a Climate Emergency. Many members of the local community spoke clearly and emotionally against the expansion plans and their strong opinions, together with the nearly 9000 written objections on the planning website, convinced the councillors to reject the application despite their officers having recently recommending acceptance.\nThere were noisy celebrations at the end of the meeting and Tarisha Finnegan-Clarke, co-ordinator of Bristol Airport Action Network (BAAN), one of the key campaigning organisations in this campaign said:\n‘I ask Bristol Airport to accept the result and not appeal against it. 83% of North Somerset residents who commented have objected to the expansion and the planning committee has thrown out the application. Be respectful of the democratic process and do not appeal.\n‘Many people involved in BAAN, local Extinction Rebellion groups, Parish Councils and other local groups have been working incredibly hard to achieve this result for over a year now. I am so pleased that the local councillors have listened to the community and rejected this application’.\nThis decision is likely to send shock-waves through the aviation industry in the UK as it may make it much more difficult for the many other airports who are currently applying to expand their passenger numbers before more difficult carbon targets are imposed on them by the Government.\nStephen Clarke, member of BAAN and a Green Party Councillor in Bristol said: ‘This is a fantastic result of hard work and real co-operation amongst campaigners and residents. It is a real ‘David and Goliath’ story as, on the one side is a £200 billion Canadian pension fund who own the airport, and on the other is a crowd-funded campaign and lots of hard work by ordinary but committed people.’\nRichard Baxter also a key member of BAAN said:\n“From the beginning of our campaigning we aimed to tell the truth and as a result thousands of people living in local communities clearly reject Bristol airport’s plans. It is wonderful that the majority of councillors of the Planning Committee have listened. Local democracy is the winner here as well as the local and global environment.”",

Following on from her email to the Mayor last Thursday, Councillor O’Rourke received a response from the Mayor in which he merely reiterated his previous refusal to explain beyond stating “Ms Klonowski was not paid any additional sum” and “left the council on the terms of the contract.”\nHowever the Mayor’s response did not explain why Ms Klonowski was paid six months’ notice despite not working it. In an attempt to clarify, councillor O’Rourke again contacted the Mayor, pointing out that “As any contract lawyer will tell you, when the employee breaches the contract, there is no legal requirement to pay the unworked notice period. The contract only required you to pay her until she ceased work”\nIn her response Councillor O’Rourke asked Mayor Rees two simple questions:\n1. Were you legally obliged to pay notice in lieu to the CEO?\n2. Assuming that the full and honest answer to the above question is ‘No’, why did you choose to pay it?\nAnd added: “Every time you’ve been asked not to make cuts to libraries or lollipop services, you’ve said, ‘If you don’t want me to cut this service, tell me where to make savings’. Well, here is a £70K saving that could have been made.”\nThe Mayor’s seventeen word response to this was:\n“I have said that I will not make any further statement on what is an HR matter.”\nFrustrated that the Mayor had sidestepped the question a second time, Councillor O’Rourke, herself a member of the HR committee, said:\n“I would direct Marvin to the Code of Conduct that Members sign up to which under the heading ‘Being Accountable’ includes the following points:\n4.1 Being accountable for my decisions and co-operating when scrutinised internally and externally, including by local residents.\n4.2 Contributing to making this authority’s decision-making processes as open and transparent as possible … but restricting access to information when the wider public interest or the law requires it.\n“In this case neither public interest nor the law require the Mayor’s silence. Mayor Rees’ refusal to explain his behaviour in unnecessarily awarding 6 months’ pay to the departing chief exec is inexcusable given the current climate of cuts and his repeated insistence that the city must find savings. This is money that could pay for about 15 lollipop crossing attendants to keep school crossings safe, or even protect a number of libraries. There is a genuine case of public interest here. As a Mayor who trumpets his commitment to transparency and openness, it is disappointing and concerning that he refuses to answer perfectly valid questions.\n“Beyond the Mayor’s leadership, there is a wider issue here, which is that Marvin seems to believe he is unaccountable for his actions and that he can hide behind confidentiality in the repeated phrase of “it’s an HR matter.” Assuming that the reason given for Ms Klonowski’s departure – to look after a seriously ill parent – is the real and full reason, there is no justification for the Mayor to hide behind HR procedures and data protection excuses to avoid explaining his decision to Bristolians.\nAll I am looking for is a justification for this decision, made solely it now seems by the Mayor. His continued lack of transparency on this issue raises questions of its own and seriously suggests that there is something to hide.”\nContact:\nCouncillor Paula O’Rourke\nCllr.Paula.ORourke@bristol.gov.uk\n07527955585\nOriginal email to the Mayor from Councillor O’Rourke:\nDear Marvin,\nI’m disappointed that you have chosen to repeat a statement previously made rather than answer my specific question. I am now forced to repeat the points, with greater clarity, in an effort to get an answer which reveals the full truth behind the resignation of the CEO.\nFirst of all, I have never alleged that any additional payment was made, so this comment does nothing to answer my question.\nWhen you say that Anna left ‘on the terms of the contract’ that does not quite tell the full story. The CEO had a fixed term contract which required either party to give six months’ notice. When Anna breached this contract, by resigning and not wanting to work her notice, you were no longer obliged to pay her notice in lieu. As any contract lawyer will tell you, when the employee breaches the contract, there is no legal requirement to pay the unworked notice period. The contract only required you to pay her until she ceased work.\nYou chose to pay Anna Klonowski, who worked with us for just 7 months, an extra 6 months’ salary because the contract gave you the freedom to make this choice without consulting with the HR committee. The purpose of my email was to try to elicit some justification for why you made that decision.\nSo, let me rephrase the question in my original email.\n1. Were you legally obliged to pay notice in lieu to the CEO?\n2. Assuming that the full and honest answer to the above question is ‘No’, why did you choose to pay it?\nYou also say you have ‘no idea why this point is being raised now‘. Let me tell you.\nEvery time you’ve been asked not to make cuts to libraries or lollipop services, you’ve said, ‘If you don’t want me to cut this service, tell me where to make savings’. Well, here is a £70K saving that could have been made.\nI assert that you did not need to make this payment to the CEO, question your decision to do so and require a full and honest answer.\nKind Regards,\nCouncillor Paula O’Rourke",

It is interesting to note that unlike our Westminster colleagues, MEPs will have a genuine say over Brexit. The withdrawal agreement and any future or transitional agreements between the EU and UK can only be enacted following consent by the European Parliament.\nHowever, for pro-EU Brits this is an emotionally harrowing time. I have had to acknowledge my future lies not with my civilized MEP colleagues, with whom I have been negotiating law by consensus for three years, but with the braying mob of UKIP MEPs and the Tories they have taken hostage. Together they have seized control of the country I love.\nThe resolution calls for the UK to maintain a close relationship with Europe, contrasting dramatically with the divisive and destructive approach of the Tory government. Within just a week of triggering Article 50 former Conservative leader Michael Howard threatens war against a European ally over Gibraltar. Such jingoism shows how powerful the Union has been in promoting peace and maintaining basic standards of diplomacy. It also reveals how flimsy these basic freedoms seem without European support.\nWhile I remain a member of the European Parliament, I will work to ensure peaceful solutions. Rather than gunships my weapon of choice is the pen and I coordinated a letter, signed by English, Scottish, Welsh and Spanish MEPs [1].

  "https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_/https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_news_reboot-democracy/content_210.html": "menu\nAt Full Council today (14 January) a Green Party motion passed to ‘reboot democracy’, committing Bristol to trialling participatory democracy schemes such as citizens’ assemblies, where ordinary citizens deliberate and produce policy ideas.\nIn citizens’ assemblies and other processes noted in the motion, people are randomly chosen and carefully selected to provide a representative sample of the local population in terms of age, education, ethnicity and so on. They are given a major issue to deliberate on and produce policy recommendations, meeting over multiple sessions, typically with access to expert advice, and often paid a stipend to support people in taking time off work.\nGreen Councillor Paula O’Rourke proposed the motion to Full Council. A Labour amendment was passed that would have delayed the motions implementation to 2022. Greens were critical of this but after securing assurances from Labour Councillor Asher Craig in the meeting that work would start sooner they backed the amendment.\nA Citizen’s Assembly on Climate Change is one of the core three demands of Extinction Rebellion, who supported the Green group’s motion and provided a supportive presence in the public forum and demonstrating outside the council building. Over 35 statements from the public were submitted in support of the motion.\nReacting to the motion passing, Cllr O’Rourke said:\n“This is a historic motion that will help us take real action on the climate emergency and hopefully begin to address a growing lack of faith in democracy and politicians. Too often politicians avoid making the bold decisions we need to tackle the climate emergency – or other complex problems – out of fear of a public or media backlash. Putting important and complicated issues in the hands of citizens with full access to expert opinion will in my opinion – and many case studies suggest – produce stronger and more ambitious climate policies, and demonstrate that there can be public support for them.”\nThe motion also contains proposals to give local people power over a certain amount of Council spending in their areas through participatory budgeting. Cllr O’Rourke said:\n“By selecting people from all strata of Bristol society and backgrounds, and paying them a stipend to attend, we can improve local democracy. Participatory budgets will allow citizens to make informed decisions about how their money is spent and, by getting people in on the ground, changes to make Bristol better will be made by the people, not for the people.”\nShe added:\n“I’m proud the council has passed this key motion. Nobody who relies on people’s votes for their position should be afraid to trust the public to make important decisions, especially when they are given access to expert advice and support as politicians are.”\nThe motion was welcomed by Green Party co-leader Sian Berry who said:\n“While other parties centralise power and shut people out, Greens put power back into the hands of local people. I’m so excited that Bristol will be empowering its citizens to take ownership of their city and set a budget which meets the needs of actual Bristolians. This is what democracy in the 21st century must look like, if we’re going to rebuild trust in politics and address the real challenges we face today”.",

Neither is he willing to address the main culprit for the poisonous air in our towns and cities: road transport.\n“Highlighting the contribution of solid fuel burners is a smoke screen designed to avoid taking on the motoring lobby. New stoves are coming on stream which eliminates almost all emissions – innovation being driven in no small part by strict emissions limits set by the EU.\n“Shifting responsibility to local authorities without firm legislation or money to back up action is grossly irresponsible. As for the suggestion that the UK could better EU environmental legislation after Brexit, this is blatantly absurd. For four decades, the real muscle when it comes to environmental protection has always been shown by the EU, and often in opposition to our own government. Air pollution is a case in point. Three times now the UK government has been taken to court by environmental lawyers for beaching EU air quality standards and last week was referred to the European Court of Justice.\n“Rather than buck passing and a ‘not me guv’ attitude, there is a clear need for leadership. We need a national network of Clean Air Zones to take the most polluting vehicles out of our cities. The government’s own research shows that these are by far the most effective way to tackle air pollution. Yet the Tories have refused to make these compulsory, instead making them voluntary and a last-resort option for local authorities.”",

She became Co-leader of the Green Party in 2021.\nClimate Emergency\nIn recognition of her work on the Climate Emergency, Carla was named politician of the year by The Big Green Politics Podcast, given the Outstanding Achievement Award by the LGA Independent Group, been named one of the Top 50 Women in Engineering, and was also nominated in the LGiU councillor achievement awards and the Bristol Diversity Awards.\nCarla wrote and proposed a motion to Bristol City Council in November 2018 calling on the Mayor to declare a climate emergency and bring Bristol’s CO2 emissions target forwards 20 years to 2030. Councillors from all parties unanimously backed the motion, meaning that Bristol now has ambitious emissions targets with radical policy implications. This was the first Climate Emergency declaration in Europe. Since then, three-quarters of UK councils have followed suit by passing similar motions, plus many universities, businesses and other organisations. The main demands of the motion were:\nEight weeks later the Green Group published their ‘Change Starts Now’ report outlining the first steps Bristol City Council needs to take, and the Green Group continues to make proposals and hold the administration to account on delivery towards this carbon-neutral target.\nWard priorities\nIn Clifton Down ward, Carla’s priorities included integrated and reliable transport options for pedestrians, cyclists and public transport alike, as well as campaigning for affordable and decent housing for everyone through measures such as landlord licensing and rent controls. In 2016 Carla called on the Mayor and Cabinet to look at extending the city’s existing landlord licensing scheme to other areas of the city and in 2019 the Cabinet did just that. Carla also hopes to increase council service responsiveness and safeguard and develop community facilities including Redland Library. Carla teamed up with University of Bristol student ambassadors and a local community association to improve street lighting in unsafe dark spots around St. John’s Road. Elsewhere in the ward, Carla supported local residents to apply for funding to make a community centre wheelchair accessible, and improve road safety outside a primary school.\nFighting cuts\nWhen the Labour administration planned cuts to the Council Tax Reduction Scheme, Carla challenged Labour’s proposal on the grounds that it would result in a tax rise for the city’s poorest households. Working alongside ACORN tenants union, she and other Green councillors successfully persuaded the Mayor to announce a u-turn on his proposals. Carla has also been involved in drafting and proposing Green amendments to Council Budgets to prevent some of the worst cuts to essential Council services – in February 2018 her amendment to reverse some of Labour’s damaging cuts to the vital Local Crisis Prevention Fund (which provides emergency payments for some of the most vulnerable people in the City) was successfully passed at the Council’s annual budget meeting.\nCarla also pushed forwards with several different campaigns including the Air Quality campaign to improve Bristol’s air, calls to increase affordable housing, the proposal of a Bristol living rent and fossil fuel divestment (which was instrumental in the University’s full divestment commitment announced in March 2018).\nYou can find out more about Carla on her personal website and the Green Party website.",

Polling suggests that if urban areas with young populations turn out to vote, then the Remain camp could sway the election, whilst a low turnout could hand it to the Leave campaign.\nSpeaking on Bristol’s role in the up-coming referendum Natalie said:\n“Bristol is an old city with a young and vibrant population.

Currently only 9% of hostels for homeless people in the UK are dog�friendly, meaning that many dog owners are denied access to shelter and support, simply because they have a dog. Likewise, rules on dog ownership for council housing or housing association tenants vary from place to place, with many councils forcing people to give up their pets to rescue centres � or remain homeless.\nIt is NOT okay to tell people they cannot have emergency housing because they have pets. It is NOT okay to leave them in cold with these pets. It’s callous. It’s discriminatory. This would NEVER happen to someone with kids. To thousands of people, their pets ARE their kids. People like Hillary Barrows in Canterbury have had to live in their cars in minus degree weather because they could not have emergency help because of their dogs. You must understand the importance of pets to the homeless, the bond, the love that is exchanged. Do not take that away from them and make them suffer.\nPlease tell me, what is our council’s position on this issue? Does our council provide emergency housing for people with dogs? Do we provide council housing for people with dogs? If so, what percentage of our emergency and council housing allows dogs? And what quantity of our emergency accommodation and council houses allow dogs?\nA: Bristol City Council commissions a range of accommodation services for vulnerable single homeless people that provide high, medium, & low support; at each support level there is housing available for people with dogs or other pets. Therefore a street homeless person with a dog should be able to access emergency accommodation & follow a pathway through supported housing to independence. We try to maximise the number of accommodation units where people can be accommodated with their dog. However, this can create management issues, especially where there are shared facilities or areas so not every project will accommodate dogs. As having a pet can obstruct people’s move on into longer term accommodation, occasionally difficult decisions about not keeping a pet need to be made.\nIn terms of families, our main emergency accommodation provider operates a general no pets policy but will take families with a dog where there are strong reasons to do so. Unfortunately we are unable to accommodate families with dogs in our 2 in-house emergency accommodation schemes due to risk to other residents, children and staff in a shared, confined environment.\nWe do not generally have dog-free flatted blocks in our Council housing & therefore a dog-owner who has been homeless would be able to live there. However there are some blocks that are designated dog free, which has happened following consultation and ballot of the people living there. Where blocks are designated as dog-free, new tenants will not be allowed to have dogs and existing tenants with dogs will not be allowed to replace them. Obviously tenants with guide dogs are excluded from this policy.\nWith regard to private rented housing, used for temporary accommodation, as there is no statutory regulation about the right to have pets, it rests merely on the terms and conditions contained in a tenancy agreement. If there is no specific clause, then they can have a pet, though the general tenancy requirement for the property to be looked after/ undamaged would have to be satisfied, as it would with all tenancies.",

This helps to counteract the fact that Council Tax itself is regressive (it costs poorer people a larger proportion of their income than richer people).\nHowever, the Conservatives’ proposal would reduce the help that low income households receive – effectively landing them with a big tax rise.\nCouncillor Carla Denyer, who has long spoken out to protect the Council Tax Reduction Scheme, including a statement to cabinet in July 2016 , explained;\n“This horribly regressive proposal doesn’t stand in isolation, it’s part of a pattern. Last year the Greens proposed a 2% council tax precept to fund adult social care, after seeing and making repeated warnings about the massive hole in the budget. We did this at a time when none of the other parties nor the then mayor were brave enough to risk proposing the Adult Social Care precept themselves, in an election year. When we proposed the precept, we were clear that such a large rise in tax would only be acceptable if the Council Tax Reduction Scheme was maintained, to protect the very poorest.\n“The Conservatives voted against the Adult Social Care precept, and when it passed despite their opposition, they then voted against the whole budget because of it. This year the precept (now 3%) is already included in the Mayor’s budget, and I wouldn’t be surprised if the Conservatives therefore vote against the budget again this year.\n“And yet, this latest Tory amendment demonstrates loud and clear that they aren’t opposed to all tax rises, they’re only opposed to tax rises that affect the rich. This amendment would mean a significant tax rise for the very poorest in the city. Whatever you think about how to balance the budget overall, and whether the austerity agenda is justified, there is no excuse for knowingly targeting the city’s very poorest citizens with a policy that will make them even poorer.”\nCouncillor Fi Hance, the Green Party member on the Council’s Cabinet, added,\n“The Conservative amendment is a self-defeating proposal in that it would almost certainly cost as much as it saves. Many of the families and individuals impacted by the cut will simply not be able to afford to pay. As a result they are likely go into arrears with the Council, or become homeless, both of which will cost the Council more in the long run and put even more pressure on budgets such as Adult Social Care”\nIf the Conservative amendment is passed at Tuesday’s meeting, it will still be subject to a public consultation before it can be brought into force for the financial year 2018/19.

They are part of the coalition government austerity programme which we, as Greens, believe is quite simply wrong. The cut of £80 million pounds, over three years to 2017, is a quarter of our total expenditure, and a lot to lose. But, we understand from senior officers, that whoever wins the forthcoming general election, the effect in Bristol is likely to be a further loss of another 12%, or £45million, over the first two years of the next government.\nThe cuts are not an act of necessity: they are an act of ideology. They victimise those who did not cause the crisis in the first place, and discriminate disproportionately against the poorest and most vulnerable in society. Some cuts are quite simply vicious: 55% of recipients of Disability Living Allowance have either had their benefit cut, or seen it entirely removed.\nBut, they are also ineffective: the Coalition austerity programme – designed to cut debt – has seen the debt increase by about 80% from 2010 levels.\nAt a national level, the alternative to austerity is simple: it is to forgo austerity. Alternative economic models do exist that suggest that you can spend your way out of recession and pay the money off in the good times. The Institute for Fiscal Studies suggests that the coalition approach of cuts has potentially set the UK economy back to the tune of £100 billion.\nAt a local level, we want to propose prudential borrowing to generate further income. We suggest investing in the profitable City Design Team, and increasing funding to the council’s Energy Company – both of which could bring in income, and would be sustainable activities. We do not agree that the MetroBus will radically alter bus usage in the city. But we do want to see a quadrupling of the number of bus users in the city – by creating more bus routes going to further parts of the city – and we also want to promote investment in infrastructure projects to increase cycling and walking activities.\nIn addition, we are pleased to support the amendments for the new recycling centre in Hartcliffe, and a swimming pool in East Bristol – both much needed public amenities.\nOverall, we agree with the intention and specifics of many of the proposed amendments – we praise council officers for their acumen in managing the cuts process: it could have been much worse – but we caution against being too complacent. This time next year we will have the same, if not more savage, cuts to decide upon.\nAs Greens, we want to see a socially just and environmentally sustainable city, country and planet. In Bristol, there are some positive moves towards sustainability. Bristolians, however, are only going to consider their long term prospects when their short term future is secure.\nAnd, against the backdrop of the cuts, too many poorer and vulnerable people have been made victims in ways which can only increase their desperation.\nEdited from Tim Malnick’s speech to council budget meeting, 17th, Feb, 2015\nIt’s completely clear to me that, as city councillors, we are discussing a city budget, the main parameters of which are dictated entirely outside our city – from Whitehall.\nThe Mayor doesn’t choose the budget he has to work with; the revenue he raises and the funding he receives are largely outside of his control; officers only choose what and where to cut, to do least damage – but they will get the flak, when services start to struggle.\nLocal people here in Bristol have little choice over where central government cuts fall hardest.\nBut the chancellor can choose. He has made clear, conscious choices, each and every one of which affects the details of the budget, the options available, and the daily lives of people in Bristol. From 2010, he has chosen to cut more from local government spending than from any other area of government.\nAnd the chancellor chooses, quite deliberately, to tell a particular story: a story that divides us into ‘workers and shirkers’, ‘hard working families and benefits cheats’ – when he knows full well that most benefit claimants are in work, have families and require help because their job contracts are too vulnerable, their wages are too low and their living costs too high.\n**\nHaving chaired the budget scrutiny committee I know there is much to support in the hard work behind this budget. There is much on the horizon that is exciting for the city and gives us hope.\nMy Green Party colleagues and I will continue to work hard, with officers and all members: to develop the case for devolution – so our city has more say over how to raise and manage our own funds; to support initiatives like the energy company when, but only when, there are clear social, environmental and local economic benefits; to find funding models that let us leverage the money we do have to enable 3rd sector organisations and local SMEs to provide the goods and services we need and tackle our long term problems.\nIn voting against the budget today, we are voting in support of all those exploring an economics based on human decency and real wealth.\nIn voting against this budget today we are joining a growing movement in Bristol in the UK and across Europe that says, “Enough. The price of austerity is not one worth paying. It costs more than it actually delivers.”\nComment from Darren Hall, Prospective Parliamentary Candidate for Bristol West:\n“Most people are now aware that the government’s austerity strategy is just a smokescreen for ideological cuts to the public sector and has very little to do with the deficit. Having worked in the civil service for over 10 years, I am horrified at the shameful destruction of the social systems that provide the foundations for our society, and especially those people that need our help the most. From legal aid to mental health, they are ripping chunks out of our society, and Big Society is just a laughable memory.\nI think local councils, including Bristol’s, are managing to weather the cuts as best they can – but many are now at breaking point. It cannot, and should not continue.”",

Air pollution is a silent killer and no decision to worsen the already polluted air in St Philips should be taken lightly.”\n“I am particularly concerned that the effects summer heatwaves have on the air pollution may not have been adequately modelled, and that old limits for NO2 dating back to 1997 are being used when we know truly safe limits are far lower. This is about saving lives from reckless development but having to do so within a legal framework that’s just not up to the job”\nThe proposal will now have to be reconsidered once further information has been provided.

The Council’s proposal appears to suggest cutting methadone-type prescription services for drug users (Opioid Substitution Treatments), and could attempt to force users into abstinence instead.\nIt does not explain how the proposal could save money. Councillor Hance pointed out that cuts in the level of support could lead to significantly increased costs for the Council in other areas through the impact on vulnerable drug users and the public.\nShe said: “Many people dependent on opiates are not ready to stop, and withdrawing methadone will mean users revert to street heroin, risking overdose, death and health problems that put them in hospital. Some may also commit crimes to fund their use. This would be a catastrophe for individuals and Bristol as a whole, and end up costing far more than any short term saving from withdrawing patients’ prescriptions.”\nThe Council’s proposal goes against evidence from government bodies such as NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) and the Advisory Council on Misuse of Drugs which recommends retaining prescription drug schemes as cost effective and suggests there is little evidence to support abstinence approaches being successful or cheaper. (2)\nResearch shows that 73% of patients in methadone maintenance stay in treatment, compared to just 16% of those receiving therapies with no medication. (3) Public Health England (PHE) advice states the prescribing physician should “maintain the patient on a stable daily dose for as long as is clinically indicated.” (4)\nPHE advice also suggests that retention on Opioid Substitution Treatment is an important driver of crime reduction, with research showing every month spent in methadone therapy, criminal convictions and cautions reduced by 1.7% with expected reductions of about 10% for every six months. (5)\nCouncillor Hance says she has tried asking questions to understand the thinking and get more information on the Council’s proposed cuts but had no meaningful response. She said:\n“It seems the Council are proposing arbitrary targets for cuts to prescriptions. They claim this proposal will save money but have presented no evidence to support this.

The petition has received so much support that it will be debated by all councillors at Full Council. It will also receive a response from the Mayor.\nThe petition calls on the Mayor to take all practical steps to eliminating wasteful plastic across Bristol and has been supported by plastics campaigners across the city. Greens have been campaigning for Bristol to become single-use plastic free for many years, tabling a motion on this in both 2015 and 2016.\nCouncillor Martin Fodor said:\n“Single use disposable plastic such as coffee cups and takeaway containers take huge resources to make, and then are just thrown away. Often they end up as litter on our street and our global reliance on plastic causes untold harm for wildlife on land and at sea. There’s now plastic waste in our food, too. It’s time to kick our singe use plastic addiction and I believe Bristol should and can readily lead the way.”\n“There are so many things that Bristol City Council could be doing to support a single-use plastic ban across our city. The Council provides licences for events, traders and take-aways who often use single-use plastic containers as their default. Just imagine what an impact it could have if these licencing rules were tightened to prevent single-use containers and incentivise other options. The reduction in waste plastics on our streets and having to be cleared up by our waste company could be dramatic.”\n“Greens have been calling for this since 2015, so I’m delighted the petition I started has gained so much support that it will now have to be debated by Full Council”\nFormer Cabinet member for waste Councillor Fi Hance said:\n“We know there are a few cases where single-use plastics are essential, such as in medical treatment. But for most daily uses there are alternatives. Events such as Redfest have led the way using reusable beer cups, water refill points, and compostable food trays, so clearly it can be done.”\n“The overwhelming support for this petition shows that Bristolians are way ahead of the Council on this, and want the Council to take action now. Residents have been showing their impatience at the slow pace of change by demonstrating at supermarkets around the city already. It’s time the Council did its bit and removed plastics from its own catering venues in museums and offices. ”\nNotes\n– The petition on banning single-use disposable plastics has received over 4000 signatures from the 38 degrees website (https://you.38degrees.org.uk/petitions/a-city-wide-ban-on-single-use-disposable-plastics), the Bristol City Council website (https://democracy.bristol.gov.uk/mgEPetitionDisplay.aspx?ID=13) and in signatures collected in hard copy.\n– Green Councillors tabled motions calling for Bristol to become single-use plastic free in both 2015 (https://www.citytosea.org.uk/getting-the-council-to-do-its-bit-in-cutting-single-use-plastics/#1) and 2016 (https://democracy.bristol.gov.uk/mgAi.aspx?ID=5049).\n– The full text of the petition is:\nPetition: We the undersigned call for the Mayor to take all practical steps* to make Bristol an exemplar disposable plastic-free city.\nSingle use, disposable plastics such as polystyrene takeaway containers and plastic cups are a cause of litter, a waste of resources, and a problem for future generations. They waste fossil fuels and create unsightly streets, and their persistence causes untold harm for wildlife on land and at sea.\nWhile accepting that there are a few cases where single-use plastics are essential, such as in medical treatment, for most uses there are alternatives. But to achieve this, many people have to play their part, including users, traders, and those organising events and providing services in the city.\nThe Council needs to play a leading role as champion, active supporter, regulator, and service provider in ending the prevalence of single use, disposable plastics. We the undersigned therefore call on the Mayor of Bristol to support and enforce a ban on single use plastic packaging and containers, including through events licensing, as a provider of services, as a partner working with other organisations, and through media and education.\n* Things the Mayor can do include:\nSpecifying how the council’s own events and facilities are run – setting a better example!\nChanging events rules.\nProcurement choices that specify alternatives.\nHelping bulk buy compostable packaging for traders via Bristol Waste Company.\nBetter promotion of recycling and composting facilities and services where they are needed.\nLicensing rules being amended for street traders and takeaways.\nBetter enforcement of littering sanctions.\nEducational initiatives.\nUsing council media work to promote the ban.\nLobbying government for better powers to control waste.\nStarted by: Cllr Martin Fodor",

They further point out that there may be an opportunity to suggest reductions to the speed on selected roads with 30mph limits, but again no decisions have been made.\nThe fact that the review is still to come and no decisions have yet been made will come as a relief to people across Bristol and especially in my ward of Southville. The rumours suggested the 20mph speed limits on some of Bristol’s streets such as North Street in Southville would be removed. This would be irresponsible, dangerous and short-sighted and I would of course oppose this move. North Street is a major shopping street at the heart of our community and also on the walking route for two local primary schools.”\nHe continued,\n“20mph speed limits reduce the likelihood of accident and death if pedestrians or cyclists are hit. It also encourages people to out onto the street. Slower speed limits are good for pedestrians, good for children and good for communities. The 20mph speed limits on roads such as North Street are emblematic of the sort of city we want for the future – streets where our children feel safe to walk to school and play out with their friends.”",

ABC worked closely with Councillor Stevens and other Councillors to demonstrate flaws with existing planning rules and helped them develop the details of the new policy. ABC’s chair said the policy was “a real step forward for communities throughout the city”.\nThe policy will restrict the proportion of shared houses (also known as ‘Houses of Multiple Occupation’ or HMOs) in parts of Bristol, setting a threshold of 10%. If approved, new HMO developments in areas of Cotham, Clifton Down and other HMO hotspots would be refused permission except in exceptional circumstances. The policy was proposed in response to a rapid expansion of HMOs in recent years to meet growing student numbers, which has restricted the supply of other types of homes and sometimes caused friction between long-term residents and students in parts of the city.\nThe new policy also sets higher quality guidelines for HMOs in an attempt to improve housing conditions, setting higher standards for room sizes, sound insulation and bin and bike storage.\nCouncillor Stevens said:\n“Way back in January 2017 I spoke at a Council meeting about how the unmanaged growth of Bristol’s universities (especially University of Bristol) was affecting our city’s housing market and thus the high rent and poor quality of accommodation suffered by students and others. Not enough halls of residence means too many conversions of homes into HMOs, making it harder for everyone else to find accommodation. And in parts of Bristol an over-concentration of HMOs has also created conflict between long-term residents and students and led to complaints over noise and waste.\n“Since 2017 I’ve been working cross-party with Labour, Tory and Lib Dem councillors to find a solution, and the result is the Council’s new HMO policy. This should set higher quality standards for HMOs and prevent new ones from being developed in areas where they already make up 10% or more of properties. I’m really glad this was approved at cabinet today – I think it will lead to a more balanced housing mix in Bristol that works for local residents, students and others.”\nCaroline Dix, chair of ABC Bristol said:\n“The HMO SPD is the culmination of 5 years hard work by the residents’ associations represented by ABC and is a real step forward for communities throughout the city – it will make a difference to so many residents in the long term. With protection from an unchecked spread of HMOs and limitations on numbers in any area, more homes will be available for families and couples and the negative impacts on communities of having high density clusters of HMOs will be reduced.\n“Although this doesn’t stop the harm in areas of the city that are already oversaturated with HMOs, it has firmly put the brakes on the situation getting any worse. We’d like to thank the BCC Councillors and Officers for their support and the work they have done with us on bringing the HMO SPD into being, ABC Bristol’s work on how we can influence planning and licensing decisions to improve or maintain communities will continue.”",

At next month’s budget meeting, Greens will be proposing a 2% increase in council tax to protect these vital services.\nCouncillor Ani Stafford-Townsend, leader of Bristol Green Party councillors said:\n“By 2020 the Tory Government will have cut the funding local authorities receive by 75%. This is leading to the decimation of many social services. Whether we use these services ourselves, or have parents or grandparents who rely on them, Greens believe no-one wants a society where we leave our elderly, disabled and vulnerable citizens uncared for in their homes.”\nThe Green amendment to the Mayor’s budget calls for the Council to take the government’s offer of a 2% increase in council tax to partially cover the shortfall in adult social care. This adult and social care precept will raise £3.5m in 2016/17.\nCouncillor Stephen Clarke, who sits on the Business Change and Resources Scrutiny Commission said:\n“The government’s offer demonstrates that even the Tories have some awareness of the devastating impact these cuts are having, but they are unfairly shifting the responsibility onto local governments. We are disappointed that the Mayor has chosen to avoid this difficult decision, which could have a severe impact on people in Bristol. Greens will call on all other parties to support the protection of these services at the budget council meeting on 16th February.”\nThe social care precept would raise council tax by 2%. For those in Council Tax Band B, the most common band in Bristol, this would mean an increase of 42p per week.\nTony Dyer, Green Party Mayoral candidate said:\n“I would not normally be in favour of raising council tax again as council tax is not the fairest method of taxation, but restrictive government policy has left Bristol with little option if we are to protect vital social care services. To help those who struggle to pay their council tax, Greens are campaigning to protect Bristol’s Council Tax Reduction Scheme. It is vital that this scheme, which supports those on low incomes, is maintained beyond 2017. I am calling on all the Mayoral candidates to make it a commitment in their election manifestos to protect Bristol’s Council Tax Reduction Scheme.”\nNotes\nAdult social care precept – the government spending review announced that upper tier councils would be able to collect a 2% precept to help fund adult social care, which is facing budget pressure in councils across the country. This gives councils the power to raise additional funds by increasing council tax by up to 2% in addition to any normal council tax rises. If adopted in Bristol, this additional 2% precept would raise £3.5m to be spent on adult social care over 2016/17. At present, the Mayor’s budget proposals have not taken up the government’s 2% precept offer. Current projections predict that the council will be £6.3m over budget for social care over 2015/16. More information can be found in the budget report being tabled at cabinet on Tuesday 12th January: https://www2.bristol.gov.uk/committee/2016/ua/ua000/0112_5.pdf (pdf).",

The challenge comes as revelations emerge that Chernobyl was one of the victims of yesterday’s massive cyber-attack affecting businesses and organisations across the Ukraine, Russia and parts of Europe.\nA Hinkley Nuclear Emergency Plan [pdf download] has been drawn up by Somerset County Council, identifying which public authorities will be informed should there be a nuclear safety breach at Hinkley Point. The list includes 15 local authorities within a 40km radius of Hinkley Point, stretching from South Wales to Mid-Devon. It includes Bristol’s neighbouring local authorities of North Somerset District Council and Bath & North East Somerset District Council, but excludes Bristol city itself, the largest population centre in the South West. Dr Scott Cato has written to the 15 local authorities, and Bristol City Council, asking them to reveal their own plans in the event of a nuclear incident. Molly said:\n“Yesterday I spoke at a conference drawing attention to the ongoing financial and human costs of the Chernobyl disaster. Sadly, we cannot assume that nuclear incidents are a thing of the past associated only with decrepit reactors in a by-gone Soviet bloc. The tragedy of Fukushima just five years ago shows we must be prepared for the worst-case scenario. And now we learn that nuclear power plant operating and monitoring systems are not immune from cyberattack. I want the public to feel reassured that their local authorities have emergency plans in place in the event of a nuclear incident at Hinkley.”\nEchoing Molly Scott Cato’s concerns, Bristol Green Group leader Councillor Eleanor Combley said:\n“I am shocked to hear that residents of Bristol could potentially be left in the dark in the event of an incident at Hinkley. Bristolians have a right to know about any incident which could have such a huge impact on their health and wellbeing. I am deeply concerned and have called on the Mayor to ensure Bristol is included in this emergency plan and do what he can to guarantee the safety of residents.”\nA recent report from the National Audit Office that concluded Hinkley C was ‘risky and expensive’ and news of possible further delays and cost over-runs to the project demonstrate the on-going controversies around giving the new nuclear power station the go-ahead. Molly went on to say:\n“Of course the greatest security that could be offered to the people of the South West would be to scrap Hinkley altogether and end the folly of nuclear power. As well as the health and safety risks, nuclear no longer has any economic legitimacy. Indeed, Hinkley has always been economically illiterate.\n“Well before Hinkley delivers a single watt of electricity, we could, given the political will, have developed our abundant renewable energy resources to deliver more power, more cheaply than Hinkley ever will. And in the process create hundreds of thousands of new jobs.”",

North Somerset Council, which sits on WECA’s Joint Committee, passed a climate emergency motion in February.\nSince the Green party motion passed in Bristol, over 100 UK councils, the London Assembly and Parliament itself have passed Climate Emergency motions. Clifton Down Councillor Carla Denyer, who proposed the Green motion in November, has submitted a question to the Combined Authority meeting taking place in Bath today calling for similar action.\nExplaining her question, Carla said:\n“I think it’s about time the West of England Metro Mayor Tim Bowles declares a Climate Emergency! I have submitted the following question to the meeting this Friday:\n‘Two of WECA’s three constituent Councils (Bristol and BANES) have declared a Climate Emergency and set new carbon emissions targets. North Somerset, in WECA’s Joint Committee has also done so, and South Gloucestershire is shortly to debate it too.\nIn line with its constituent local authorities, will WECA declare a Climate Emergency and commit the West of England to go carbon neutral by 2030?’”\nRedland Councillor Martin Fodor has also submitted a statement to the meeting calling on the authority to declare a climate emergency, and bemoaned the authority’s lack of delivery despite its large pool of funding.\nHe said:\n“Like many people I’m frustrated at the way WECA has been accumulating funds with little useful to show for it. Here’s an urgent issue and we can’t wait any longer for action. I really want to know when the climate emergency will be recognised by WECA and when it will start to rewrite its plans and develop a detailed strategy to prepare climate-proofing projects we need and revising its spending plans? People are getting impatient with reports about doing more reports on possible strategy before there’s even a strategy!\n“Already two of the three authorities in WECA have declared a climate emergency, and South Gloucestershire is drafting a motion on the same subject.

This makes it all the more outrageous that the UK is among the countries blocking progress on the future EU blacklist. If the UK is to have a positive future trading relationship with the EU, it is going to have to clean up its act when it comes to tax. Regulating the legal limbo of its overseas territories is likely to be a key demand and the UK government should use the powers at its disposal to end their tax secrecy.\n“The report of the Panama Papers inquiry has already come up with concrete policy proposals that could help to prevent the activity revealed in the Paradise Papers. That another major leak has emerged before we have even completed our work on the last one shows the scale of the problem we face. The European Parliament needs a permanent inquiry committee, along the lines of those already seen in the US Congress, to enable the parliament to react quickly to future reports of tax avoidance, evasion and money laundering.”",

While the trade union bill threatens to further undermine the ability of the unions to protect their workers, the TTIP trade deal threatens to undermine labour standards across Europe. The deal could also prevent local authorities from choosing to allow environmental and social considerations, such as choosing to buy fairtrade or organic, when awarding contracts.”\nGreens have been fighting TTIP at local, national and EU level. South West MEP Molly Scott Cato has been working with Green politicians from across Europe to oppose the deal in the European Parliament commented:\n“Over three million European citizens have called for the EU to stop negotiating this trade deal in their name. I would be delighted if Bristol Council added its name to the many opposing TTIP.\nEarlier this year I was allowed to see the “top secret” TTIP documents, which EU citizens have been prevented from seeing, but only after I was required to sign a document swearing me to secrecy. This means I am not allowed to disclose what I have seen. However I can say that the experience did not leave me with any sense of reassurance, either that the process of negotiating this trade deal is democratic, or that the negotiators are operating on behalf of citizens. TTIP is a corporate charter and we must do all we can against this treaty that is a serious threat to our democracy, workers’ rights and our environmental standards.”\nCouncillor McMullen continued: “We feel it is wrong that deals are being made that will restrict national and local government’s ability to conduct its own affairs, and yet no Councillors or MPs are allowed to scrutinise the documents or input into the negotiations”.\nFULL COUNCIL MOTION – 10 NOVEMBER 2015\nThis council notes:\nThis council believes that:\nThis council resolves:\nMotion to be moved by Cllr McMullen\nDate of submission: 30 October 2015\nImage from Federation of European Young Greens",

  "https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_/https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_bristol-green-party-councillors-statement-on-residents-parking-schemes-rps/content_1039.html": "menu\nBristol Green Party’s policy on Residents’ Parking Zones has been to support it when residents are in favour of it. This has not changed.\nWhat has changed is that we now have a Mayor who has made a decision that Residents’ Parking Schemes (RPS) will be introduced throughout central Bristol. We would not have sought\nto impose them without local referenda, but the Mayor has been elected to think strategically about the whole city. The Mayor has made it clear repeatedly that this decision is final and the schemes will be going ahead.\nWe have noticed that the Mayor has an unconventional approach to consultation. He seems to think that announcing his intention and then dealing with the resulting furor is a form of consultation. This approach can leave out those members of our communities who do not use social media. It can also give a false impression of what people really think because there is no reliable data generated.\nWe think that Local Government needs to use mechanisms at its disposal to ensure that all parts of our diverse community are reached by consultation. This means using the Neighbourhood Partnerships, community and faith groups as well as schools and business organisations.\nWe feel that the launch of this important measure to control commuter parking, reduce congestion and improve air quality could have been handled more sensitively by the Mayor. The strength of feeling over this issue was entirely predictable and the lack of information regarding key issues has made it difficult to deal with the genuine concerns of some residents.\nA small amount of research shows that other cities have dealt with such issues as key workers, trades people, businesses, landlords and charities.\nThere also seem to be cities that zone residents parking into those that have a problem now (inner city) and those that don’t (outer city). Unsurprisingly inner city residents are generally accepting of the introduction of these schemes whilst areas further out, which do not have a problem now, don’t. However these outer zones are needed if they are not to become full of cars displaced from the inner zones.\nWe have had little in the way of ideas from the Mayor’s office about what is on offer for customising schemes to suit the areas they serve.\nIf RPSs are to work, public transport needs to improve. We would welcome information from the Mayor as to how the city’s public transport is to be improved to cope with the inevitable increase in passenger volume that will result from reduced use of the car.\nHow will more cycling and walking be encouraged? Bike parking provision is already inadequate, what plans are there to improve this?\nHow does the Mayor intend to fund this much needed upgrade to the public transport service, not only within the city, but also to and from the surrounding towns and villages. Bristol Green Party would support the introduction of a workplace parking levy which would be charged to employers who provide more than 10 car parking spaces.\nAs Councilors we are working hard to ensure that the schemes introduced will meet the needs of the people we represent. We are not entering into the campaigns for or against the schemes as this decision has already been made.\nWe feel that there is too much heat in this situation. We have been subject to some very aggressive campaigning against the schemes. These questions should be directed at the Mayor as it is he who has made this decision and only he who can change the policy.\nOur postbags are not dominated by those against the introduction of these schemes. Many have contacted us to express their support for their introduction. Some of these people feel intimidated by the style of campaigning adopted by some of those against the introduction of an RPS. We urge all concerned to not lose perspective on this issue, it is emotive, but it is important to respect all view points.\nWe see our role as listening to specific concerns about how the schemes will operate in particular localities and presenting these to the Mayor so that we get the best scheme for each area.\nMany people have reasonable concerns about how these schemes operate and we do not want their concerns to be drowned out by all the noise. These are the areas of concern that have been raised with us:\nWe do not believe that these schemes should be used to raise funds. However if they are to be introduced we do think that it is fair that the schemes fund themselves. The Kingsdown scheme did not fund itself as the cost of making the road improvements necessary were borne by the council. We understand this is why the charges are higher for the proposed zones than for those already in existence.\nWe do think there is scope for differential charging in different areas.\nThese will not be the same for all areas. Please do contact us with your thoughts. These do need to be tailored to meet local needs and one size will definitely not fit all.\nThe existing zones treat flats paying separate council tax as separate households each with a full entitlement to permits.\nIn existing schemes these are treated as one household with one entitlement to permits\nThe existing schemes allow 50 free permits per year with the possibility of a further 50 priced at £1 per day. If the scheme operates from Monday to Saturday 50 is increased to 60.\nGenerally, conservation associations welcome these schemes as they are usually viewed as helping to preserve front gardens. By making parking easier for residents the pressure to convert front gardens usually falls. The conversion of front gardens to car parking will still require planning permission.\nStudents will be treated in exactly the same way as other residents. Cars will need to be registered at the address within the relevant zone. This will act as a discouragement to some as they may prefer to have their vehicle registered at a parental address. Some other cities operate student parking permits.\nHolders of blue disabled badges can park free of charge in any disabled bay or in any of the metered spaces.\nWe strongly believe that sufficient short stay free parking needs to be designed into the system, with metered low cost parking for longer visits. Providing this is done an RPS can help traders by making finding a space much easier albeit introducing a small charge\nWe are particularly keen to see that the needs of small businesses are taken into account and that use of our high street shops is made easier. The existing schemes allow businesses, schools or organisations based in an RPS to apply for two business permits. They are also able to buy up to five customer permits. We would welcome any ideas as to how the introduction of an RPS can be used to help businesses\nWe would like to see a citywide pass introduced to allow care workers, midwives, health visitors, etc. to go about their business.\nThe existing schemes allow Owners to apply for one business permit for every ten properties that they own.\nPeople coming into work using residential streets as work car parks will be affected by the introduction of RPSs. If Bristol is to become less clogged by cars and their fumes, then more people are going to have to travel to work by foot, bike or public transport.\nThe Mayor has said that he has asked council officers to investigate congestion charging. If he were to decide to introduce this then this it could raise money to be spent on public transport. We also urge the Mayor to look at introducing a workplace parking levy.\nBristol Green Party has long argued that the region needs to have an integrated transport authority if reliance on cars is to be reduced. Surrounding local authorities, who have many residents working in Bristol, rely on free parking within Bristol. We hope that introducing these schemes puts pressure on these authorities to stop exporting their transport problems to Bristol and start seeing the need for an integrated transport authority.\nWe intend to work with residents to achieve the most appropriate scheme for each locality and to ensure that parking space available is shared in the fairest way possible. We welcome the opportunity presented to rationalise provision so that pavements are not blocked and can be used\nby prams, pushchairs and wheelchairs.\nWe think that RPSs have the potential to greatly improve life in the city by reducing traffic circulating in residential streets in search of free parking. The resulting reduction in congestion and air pollution is an important benefit, which should not be overlooked.\nWe expect most residents and local traders to see these benefits over time and come to like the schemes once they are introduced. If this is not the case, or there are specific problems, we will be there to help adapt the schemes in the light of that experience.\nCllr Tess Green – Southville\nCllr Gus Hoyt – Ashley\nCllr Daniella Radice – Bishopston\nCllr Rob Telford – Ashley\n6th June 2013",

The growing gap between rent and income means the average long-term renter living in Bristol since 2012 will have paid an ‘excess premium’ totalling £15,461 to their landlord.\nBetween 2011 and 2020 Bristol’s renters paid landlords £5.6 billion – almost £869 million more than if rent increases had matched wages. In that time the median rent in the city, or rent paid by the average Bristol renter, has gone up from £650 per month to £1026. [sources in notes below]\nAt the current average house price in the ward, the overcharged £869 million would be enough to purchase every rented home in Bedminster almost twice over today.\nBristol Green Party has launched a new ‘overcharged rent calculator’ which Bristol renters can use to look at their own circumstances.\nBy entering the year they started renting in Bristol (back to 2012) the calculator will work out the rent they have each paid above what would have matched average wage rises.\nBristol private renter Amy, who has been paying over a third of her take-home pay in rent and has lived in the city since 2017, says:\n“I used the calculator and was shocked at the figure – £7,617 overpaid compared to if rents had only risen with wages. My partner and I have been trapped in the rental market for so many years.\n“I feel so lucky to have been able to save during lockdown and get help from parents to finally get a mortgage – the extra we’ve paid to landlords since moving to Bristol could have made a huge difference.”\nGreens in Bristol have also launched a petition to Mayor Marvin Rees calling for a unified effort from city and regional Mayors to demand rent control powers from the government. The Mayor’s 2021 election manifesto pledged to “campaign for the power to introduce rent controls to make Bristol an affordable living city”.\nGreen Councillor for Clifton Down, Tom Hathway said:\n“I’ve grown up and now rent in Bristol, and have watched friends move further and further away from our city due to the increasing cost of living where they were raised.\n“I welcome the Mayor’s support for rent controls, which are common across Europe and America, and invite him to unite with city and regional Mayors on a clear demand to the government for devolution of powers.\n“The cost of living in Bristol is leaving people trapped in a cycle of insecurity and cannot be left to continue to spiral out of control.”\nNotes\nThe petition calls on the Mayor to:\n“1) Further lobby the Government for rent controls so that we have the power locally to impose rent controls to protect private renters\n2) Work with Mayors of other UK cities and regions to ensure there is a unified call for rent controls\n3) Report annually on what fair rents for dwellings in Bristol should be”",

The way it works, in detail, is that all first preferences are counted and if no candidate receives over 50% of the vote (which is almost impossible with 13 candidates) then the top two candidates go through to a “final round”. In the final round, all second preferences that are cast for the top two candidates are added to their first preference total. If you voted for both of these candidates as first and second preference, then only your first preference counts. If your second preference is for any other candidate that doesn’t make the top two, this unfortunately means that your second preference is not counted either. While the supplementary vote is an improvement to the voting system used for electing our MPs and councillors (“first past the post”) it still has major flaws. Like first-past-the-post, it encourages voters to vote tactically, rather than for what they truly believe in. Ultimately The Greens favour other more representative voting systems such as the alternative vote or the single transferrable vote.",

In 1997 it was recognised that planning permission was required, and a series of temporary permissions were granted to give the Zoo time to develop other solutions.\nCouncillors on successive planning committees have recognised that permanent use of the land off Ladies Mile as a car park would be unacceptable.\nThe Zoo’s latest temporary parking permission expired after three years in May 2013. However the Zoo has now applied for permission to park 700 cars on 60 days a year for another five years.\nThe Green Party has joined a host of other groups in objecting to the renewal, on the grounds that the Downs are guaranteed by Act of Parliament for the recreation of the citizens of Bristol, and that use as a car park interferes with that enjoyment and causes environmental damage.\nOpposition includes the national Open Spaces Society, Bristol Ramblers, Avon Wildlife Trust, Bristol Civic Society, Bristol and Gloucestershire Archaeological Society, Friends of the Downs and Avon Gorge, Clifton and Hotwells Improvement Society, and Redland and Cotham Amenity Society.\nThe Central Planning meeting is entirely public, and it is expected that various objectors listed will attend the meeting to voice their opposition to the plans.\nThe Deputy Leader of the Bristol Green Party and former Mayoral candidate, Daniella Radice, said:\n“Surely it is inconceivable that visitors attracted to the city by its status as European Green Capital, and hearing about this fantastic and unique Open Space, should arrive in 2015 to find it covered in cars.”\n“We all have great affection for the Zoo, and that is why successive planning committees have bent over backwards to help them.

Above this, the risks to humanity of floods, droughts, extreme heat and poverty become much greater, impacting on hundreds of millions more people.(2) The motion text notes the progress already made by Bristol Council, and argues that as a former European Green Capital, Bristol has an important role to play in leading the UK in reducing carbon emissions as fast as possible. It asks the city’s Mayor Marvin Rees to declare a Climate Emergency and pledge to make Bristol carbon neutral by 2030 (bringing forward the current target by 20 years), call on national government for more powers and resources to support this, work with partners in Bristol and other governments both in the UK and nationally to prevent climate change above 1.5°C, and to report back in six months on the actions that will be taken to address the emergency.\nCouncillor Denyer said:\n“This is a fantastic day for Bristol and I’m delighted the Council will be bringing forward its target for carbon neutrality to 2030. The IPCC report made it clear that time to preserve Earth as we know it is running out. We can’t wait for the UN or national governments to negotiate when we have just 12 years to act – we have to show how it’s done and commit to ambitious action at the level of cities, which we did this evening.\n“I’m grateful to my colleagues in the Green Group, who supported me in bringing this motion to council and leading the other political groups in the right direction, to those councillors from other parties who saw the importance of taking action, and to the public who did a fantastic job submitting statements and emailing their councillors in support of this motion. Thanks to all of you, Bristol is now leading the rest of the UK on climate change.”\nCouncillor Steve Clarke, who seconded the motion, said he was overjoyed by the outcome and added:\n“The next step is to ensure that this evening’s commitments are followed by ambitious action. Over the coming years, Greens will continue to hold Bristol Council to account on today’s decision, no matter what party is in power. We know that 2030 is a big commitment for the city and to meet this target an awareness of carbon emissions will have to factor into every decision the Council takes. We look forward to the Mayor reporting back to us in 6 months on what action he will take.”\nBackground:\n– Insects and plants were almost twice as likely to lose half their habitat at 2°C compared with 1.5°C warming\n– Coral populations would be wiped out at 2°C warming but more than 10% would have a chance of surviving at the lower temperature\n– Global fish stocks would lose 3 million tonnes at 2°C, twice the decline of 1.5°C, due to lower oxygen levels and greater acidity in the ocean\n– Hundreds of millions more people, particularly in less developed countries, would be at risk of climate-related poverty with a 2°C increase\n– The global population exposed to water stress would be 50% lower with 1.5°C warming\n– At current levels, the world is on course for 3°C of warming",

The Brunel Partnership is a conglomeration of 10 pension funds worth a total of £28 billion, including the Avon Pension Fund that covers Bristol City Council and other local authorities in the area.\nThe campaign for large institutional local pension funds to divest from fossil fuels has been running for years – two years ago Green councillors in Bristol proposed a successful motion to Full Council which called on the Council to lobby the Avon pension fund to divest and diversify from fossil fuels. The recent update from the Brunel Partnership showed significant investments in cleaner energy projects, and tougher ethical and sustainable criteria for all new investments, but slow progress towards actual divestment of funds away from fossil fuels.\nCouncillor Fodor said:\n“This was always going to be a slow process but I’m glad to see that progress is starting to be made as large funds begin to shift towards renewables. It’s great that following our campaigning, more money from these funds will be going to environmentally sound energy projects, and that more green criteria are being used for all new funding received. We’re going to keep the pressure up for clearer reporting and monitoring, to prove fossil and carbon liabilities are being eliminated. At the end of the day we want to see evidence that people’s money is going to the right places, not just engagement with companies promising incremental action in the face of climate warnings. Real action is urgently needed to achieve the Paris climate targets and head off runaway climate change.\n“But it doesn’t end here. We’ve been campaigning around large institutional funds like the Avon Pension Fund. But now the UK government has changed its rules for private pension funds, anyone can write to their pension provider and have their say on where their money is being invested. Environmental, social and governance issues are valid factors to help ensure the funds are fulfilling their long term fiduciary (pension investment return) obligations. Not only that, but asking your provider to divest from fossil fuels will help support a UK-wide shift into renewable energy. Pension funds are incredibly powerful investors and collective action from enough people will help to push them to focus on long term risks and opportunities for the benefit of the whole country.”\nThe second largest trade union in the country, Unison, also supports the campaign. Unison members in the area form a significant percentage of the pension fund membership. A representative from the Bristol branch of Unison gave the following statement:\n“The Bristol Unison branch has actively supported this campaign since its early days and made its own request to Avon Pension Fund (APF) to move its endowment away from fossil fuel companies, and towards investment in renewable energy. We were delighted when the National conference of Unison also voted in June 2017 to seek divestment of Local Government Pension Schemes from fossil fuels. The current effects of Climate Change are hitting the poorest, least empowered workers in the world the hardest and Unison recognises that they need our support. We are delighted to see that, at last, there is a move in APF towards more positive investment in renewables. We look forward to hearing of further progress towards complete divestment from fossil fuels.”\nBackground:\n– In December 2015 Green councillors in Bristol put forward a successful motion to Full Council which called on the Council to lobby the Avon pension fund to divest and diversify away from fossil fuels. (https://www.bristolgreenparty.org.uk/news/council-votes-for-fossil-free-pensions)\n– Earlier this year Bristol University announced new plans to divest its endowment fund from the most carbon intensive fossil fuel sectors, following campaigning and Court motions submitted by Green councillor Carla Denyer (https://www.bristolgreenparty.org.uk/news/bristol-university-announces-divestment-plans)",
  "https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_/https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_news_decision-on-broadmead-redevelopment-delayed-following-opposition-from-green-councillors/content_480.html": "menu\nAt a planning meeting today at Bristol City Hall, a planning committee expressed strong support for proposals to develop a large part of the Broadmead shopping area but rejected the car park included in plans and its access through Brunswick Square. This comes after local campaigners and Green Party councillors successfully highlighted the air pollution and traffic impacts of the proposed development plan.\nThe proposed development has been criticised by opponents including Bristol Cycling Campaign and South West Transport Network for overly being car-centric with its proposal for a large multi-storey car park on Bond Street. A 38 Degrees ‘Let Broadmead Breathe’ petition which attracted nearly 900 signatures called on planners to reject the proposal because of the impact on air quality and congestion. Opponents argued the proposal would cause a significant increase in traffic and make it more difficult to access shops by walking or cycling. Delays caused by road works and traffic jams could have a significant impact on journey times of bus passengers and drivers and the increased traffic presence would likely impact significantly on air quality in an area of the city which has long been above the legal limit for air pollution (See air quality report to cabinet here).\nCouncillor Jerome Thomas, deputy leader of the Green Group, said:\n“I’m glad that the planning committee, with support from all political parties, has responded to our concerns in rejecting the car park element of these planning proposals. New development plans must deal with air quality and traffic congestion as key issues rather than treating them as afterthoughts”.\nIn its consultee comment (available online) Historic England had also expressed concerns over the proposed car park, and noted that “any tall buildings located specifically on the northern boundary of the site are likely to have an impact upon Brunswick Square and Portland Square with Grade I buildings that line all four sides.”\nBristol Cycling Campaign has also objected to the planning proposals and issued the following statement:\n“Major developments such as [this one] represent rare opportunities to create the future we want, of a liveable, healthy and prosperous city. These proposals do little to welcome and encourage more active travelling by foot and cycle. It’s just not good enough to provide a few cycling contraflows and shared use pavements, with a relative handful of cycle parking spaces, while including over 500 more car parking spaces.”\nIn a statement submitted to the committee, Green Party Councillor Cleo Lake argued for an alternative vision, stating: “I would advocate for working towards car free zones with better cycling and pedestrian provision and lower CO2 emissions, following the examples of other major forward thinking European cities such as Oslo and Madrid.”\nBackground:\n– The health impacts of air pollution include poor lung development and asthma among children, and deaths from cardiac and respiratory causes among adults. Bristol Council research estimates that around 300 deaths per year (8.5% of deaths in the city) are attributable to air pollution.\n– Bristol Green Party has developed a five point plan to tackle the city’s air pollution crisis – for more info see https://bristolgreenparty.org.uk/five-point-plan\nContact:\nCouncillor Jerome Thomas\nCllr.jerome.thomas@bristol.gov.uk\n01179733076\nGreen Party Councillor Group\nBristol City Council\n0117 3526155",

If the polls are right, and I am chosen to represent the people of the South West on Thursday, my job will be to make sure that the small businesses and citizens of our region are better served by the European Union and that our values and priorities are influential in policy-making in Brussels.

In exchange for a 250-year lease, £26m of existing investment, and a guaranteed rent of up to £120m paid to Legal and General over 40 years, the Council will have little control over the development and may not achieve the desired outcomes of affordable homes, jobs or business growth. It certainly won’t create an Arena for the people of Bristol!”\n“Under the guise of an innovative business model the Mayor is selling off land paid for by the taxpayer to build the arena, in return for a guaranteed profit to a global business with no particular interest in meeting the city’s objectives on affordable homes, local jobs or business. This is a naïve approach that is more risky than the original arena plan,” he continued.\n“Legal and General have recently been criticised for reducing the number of affordable homes in another development and the Mayor’s proposal gives no guarantee they will not do the same. It could still be possible to build the arena for the people of Bristol creating a great cultural offer, jobs where they are needed in the South of the city, and reduce the number of car journeys by putting the arena next to Temple Meads. But instead we are committing millions of pounds of tax payer’s money to a multinational company and its profits, to create a conference centre. This is a lacklustre vision for our City,” he concluded.\nA number of other approaches are given in the appendix to the document but are not being considered by cabinet. These include a straight sale of the land or a joint venture. The joint venture would ‘allow the Council to exercise control over the development’.\nThe BCC cabinet report further states: ‘The Strategic partnership would be supported by a non-legally binding Memorandum of Understanding’ thereby providing no legal recourse to investment made by BCC until the lease is signed.\nGreen Councillors will be asking key questions about the legality of this arrangement – an MOU agreed without going out to official tender – at the Cabinet meeting next week.\nEnds\nNotes to editors\n[1] £120m is worked out as £30/ft2 (current high end market rent is £40/ft2)\n[2] Full details of the cabinet papers can be found here. https://democracy.bristol.gov.uk/documents/g3685/Public%20reports%20pack%2002nd-Jul-2019%2016.00%20Cabinet.pdf?T=10",

With more people keen to walk and cycle since the pandemic started, we now need a network of safer segregated walking and cycling networks more than ever. ”\n“Bristol bridge has always been a difficult and confusing junction for pedestrians and cyclists, and Upper Maudlin Street is constantly dangerous and intimidating so I welcome the bridge closure to most traffic and new route to make the city safer and improve air pollution.”\nCouncillor Jerome Thomas added:\n“There is growing evidence that those who have to breathe dirty air are more likely to be badly affected by coronavirus, so we have to act now to protect communities across our city.”\n“Wherever we live in Bristol, we should be able to walk our children to school, or cycle to work safely and this means dramatically improving walking and cycling infrastructure.

  "https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_/https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_bristol-greens-celebrate-stunning-election-results/content_883.html": "menu\nIn a series of stunning victories, Bristol Green Party won 7 new seats on Bristol City Council in the local elections on Thursday! They also convincingly kept an 8th seat in Ashley which they already held. Together with the 6 seats they already hold, this means that the Greens now have 13 seats on the city council.\nFor the Greens, together with the Green Party’s fantastic second place with 27% of the vote in the general election in Bristol West, Thursday night’s local election results represent a sea change in Green Party support and representation in Bristol. With their 13 seats, the Greens have 3 seats more than the Liberal Democrats, and are now the third largest party on Bristol city council.\nThe Greens’ 17,227 votes in the general election in the Bristol West constituency means they are also now the main challenger to the Labour Party to win the parliamentary seat in the future, having beaten former Liberal Democrat MP Stephen Williams into third place by well over 5000 votes.\nIn Ashley, Gus Hoyt held his Green seat on the council with an amazing 4470 votes which was 51% of the total vote in the ward. This is possibly the largest number of votes ever received by any councillor for any party in Bristol in a city council election.\nThe Green Party won a landslide in new seat after new seat, as Cabot, Clifton, Clifton East, Cotham, Easton, Southville and Windmill Hill all fell like dominoes in the Green gale.\nIn Easton, Anna McMullen got a massive 47% of the vote in a 1000 vote victory over the Labour Party. It was a similar story in Cotham, where Dani Glazzard got a triumphant 43% of the vote, a clear majority of more than 1400 over the Liberal Democrats, and in Cabot, where Ani Stafford-Townsend won with a 1224 vote majority over Labour, a huge 38% of the vote. In Lawrence Hill, Jude English achieved a great result, coming second to Labour with 28% of the vote in a ward to which we had allocated less resources than others.\nIn South Bristol, the Greens’ Stephen Clarke took the second council seat in Southville, again with 45% of the vote, nearly 1200 votes more than Labour, while Deb Joffe also had a 1000 vote victory over Labour with 40% of the vote in Windmill Hill. Labour also nearly lost Bedminster to the Greens, where, in a great effort, the Green Party’s Alan Baker was only 260 votes away from winning with an excellent 2160 votes, a vote share of over 30%.\nAlthough hoped for, more unexpected were the fantastic Green victories in Clifton and Clifton East. Jerome Ungoed-Thomas took Clifton for the Green Party with a 300 vote victory over the Conservatives and a 33% share of the vote. Last to declare was Clifton East, where our Carla Denyer won with a 260 vote majority over the Conservatives, also nearly a 33% vote share. The Clifton and Clifton East victories were especially sweet because they were victories over the Tories in seats which the Conservatives had expected to win, especially in view of the Liberal Democrats’ decline.\nAll of these excellent results, without exception, were very well deserved, but they were only won because the teams and their members and helpers in every single ward worked incredibly hard for weeks, but especially during the final month of the campaign. We give our heartfelt thanks to everyone who in any way gave of their time, energy and commitment in order to help us win these victories, not forgetting the teams in Bishopston and Redland where there were no council elections.\nFor the Green Party, all these incredible results are a vindication of all that the Greens stand for, of their faith and belief over a long time in Bristol as a city with a huge Green base, but most of all they are a victory and reward for all those Bristol people who went out and actively demonstrated their faith and belief by voting Green on Thursday.

The vote followed a Green Party motion put to the November full council meeting.\nThe vote follows work by Greens for much of 2015 to see action gets taken to clean up Bristol’s illegal air limits including tabling a clean air motion at Full Council, supporting local residents to get over 4,000 signatures calling for a clean air zone and collecting surveys on air pollution across the city.”\nActually it started before 2015\nGreen legend GlennVowles was campagning for clean air in 1989.\nBudget amendment\nThis started in February of this year when a motion to a budget amendment proposed by Jerome Thomas was defeated by other parties. The amendment – if passed – would have funded to work out the detail of how a Clean Air Zone might work.\n5 point plan\nGreens worked up a 5 point plan – based on the Policy Exchange 10 point plan. This calls for more walking and cycling, cleaner buses, supporting cleaner taxis, restrictions on the most polluting cars from entering Bristol, and promoting electric vehicles and car clubs.\nSurvey\nIn the autumn of this year, the Greens launched a survey of Bristol residents to find out their views on air pollution. It consisted of both an on-line survey and paper based surveying carried out at a variety of locations around the city (mainly in inner Bristol). It established that over half of those surveyed believe their health is affected by the different pollutants. It also established overwhelming support for each of the parts of the 5 point plan.\nPetition\nSubsequently, Greens heavily supported and promoted a petition for Clean Air (which basically said more or less everything we asked for – handy that!). The 38 degrees petition got just under 4,200 signatures in a fortnight.\nStatues\nObviously, the Green Party couldn’t endorse the hanging of gas marks on statues along with ‘Let Bristol Breathe’ banners. But it seems someone did just that.\nMotion\nThe motion to full council asked Bristol to lobby for its inclusion in a Clean Air Zone; it commits it to having a Clean Air Zone, once legislation is in place; it includes the 5 point plan; it requires a robust air quality strategy; and it requires longer term targets.\nWhat next?\nWe will be discussing this . But – well, getting a motion unanimously through a council meeting is great, but the air is no cleaner today. So a key part of what we need to do is to see this thing through.\nBeyond that, there are a whole set of things that need to be addressed – ranging from setting up a local Clean Air alliance to addressing other causes of air pollutants.\nBut the work doesn’t stop there – lives are being shortened every day so there is no time for delay. We need to see our Mayor and MPs take immediate action in Bristol to remove the barriers to clean air, including cleaning up the bus fleet, supporting taxis to meet clean emission standards and restricting heavily polluting vehicles from the most polluted streets in our city.\nWhat do you think?

Where landlords do not comply with the required standards, enforcement action could be taken by the council.\nGreen Councillor Carla Denyer, who has repeatedly called for landlord licensing in Bristol over recent years, welcomed the news.\nSpeaking after the meeting, Cllr Denyer said:\n“It’s great to see the HMO landlord licensing proposal go through at today’s Cabinet meeting. I have been campaigning for extended licensing of the city’s landlords for years, working closely with ACORN tenants’ union. While Clifton Down is in many ways a privileged part of the city, and most residents feel lucky to live here, the quality of private rented accommodation is highly variable. I have met many people living in shared houses who pay extortionate rent, yet have frequent battles to get their landlord to fix a broken toilet or mend a leaking roof. This is unacceptable.\n“In 2016 I called on the Mayor and Cabinet to look at extending the city’s existing licensing scheme to other areas of the city, following consultation with local communities.

Since the end of lockdown, air pollution has begun to rise to dangerous levels again with Bristol city centre already returning to pre-lockdown levels. They say immediate action is needed so we can all breathe safe, clean air.\nClean air is particularly important as coronavirus cases begin to rise, as there is increasing evidence that those who breathe dirty air are more likely to be badly affected by the virus.\nLocal Green campaigner Ani Stafford-Townsend (pictured) says,\n“During lockdown, many people enjoyed the improved air quality with reduced traffic levels. Air pollution has now gone back to pre lockdown levels, and many asthma sufferers like myself have needed to restart medication that we didn’t need to use during lockdown.”\nJerome Thomas, local Green councillor, adds,\n“We need clean air across our city – in every community not just the city centre. We need clean air so that parents can feel happy walking their children to school and so that people can exercise without fear of getting an asthma attack. We know that disproportionately the people whose lives are shortened by air pollution are the poorest and most vulnerable members of our communities – it’s time for that to stop.\n“We welcome the city centre changes to reduce traffic as a step in the right direction, but it looks likely that this will not be enough to ensure communities across our city are able to breathe clean air. Government evidence shows that Clean Air Zones are the most effective way of quickly slashing illegal pollution levels. I am calling on the Mayor to share the current measurements on air quality and the impact of his proposals so people can make an informed decision on Clean Air Zones.”\nThe council has recently opened a consultation on some of the options being considered to improve Bristol’s air. Sadly this consultation doesn’t include the information needed for residents to make an informed choice. Greens want the Mayor to make pollution readings across the city available, as well as the modelled impacts of the different options being considered.

The owner intends to offer six month tenancies, inclusive of bills.\nLorraine Francis, Green candidate for St George West, said, “I am committed to listening to communities, and to hear what the concerns are for local people. The Post’s article is confusing however. Are residents concerned that a building will be given planning permission for HMO usage or that it would be migrants living in the accommodation? I am concerned that an important local issue is being reported in an inflammatory way. The impact of transient residents on an area is the same regardless of those residents’ nationality, and it is this impact that seems to be the community’s main concern. I will be discussing the issue with local residents”.\nTony Dyer, Green candidate for Mayor of Bristol, said, “I am committed to building 8,000 new homes in Bristol, including speeding up the delivery of as many as possible of the 9,000 homes in the city which already have planning permission but have not yet been built. However it is vital that we build not just houses but communities and that means listening to local people and ensuring their concerns are addressed in regards to new development. We need to provide good quality housing for a wide range of needs and that will inevitably lead to concerns about the impact of housing types aimed at a specific sector. It is important to ensure that the council and developers fully explain any positive and/or negative effects of such development, including possible mitigation measures if needed, so that local residents are as clearly informed as possible”.\nAni Stafford-Townsend, Leader of the Green Group on Council, speaking from her experience as a former Development Control Committee Chair, said, “looking over the plan, it’s not clear what the size allocation is for each room. However, at face value it doesn’t look like people are being squeezed in. Residents’ concerns about transience are understandable, though I’d suggest the bigger concern should be the level of rent that will be charged. A HMO like this would have the potential to inflate housing costs in the area if it charges a higher than average rent. If I was chairing the committee looking at this, I’d want a site visit to get a sense of size, and reassurances on quality of finish and rental levels. A more convincing attempt at easing the housing crisis would include a kitchen in each unit rather than communal facilities”.",

As a Green politician and a parent, I know only too well how urgently we need to protect our schools and our children’s futures.”\n“The education system in Bristol, under the Tories, is already under immense pressure, £33m cuts [2] will make it that much harder for teachers and headteachers to do their jobs – and put an estimated 1000 jobs at risk [3].”\n“Such vast cuts will have an unavoidable negative impact on the quality of education available to pupils across Bristol. We’re already seeing schools like Redland Green [4] and Olympus [5] feeling forced to go cap in hand to parents as the funding crisis hits critical levels.”\n“These cuts are particularly hard to stomach when viewed alongside plans for billions of pounds of education funding to be diverted into Theresa May’s grammar schools vanity projects and Cameron’s inefficient, underused and chaotic free school failures.”\nParents, teachers, headteachers, the Green Party, unions, and high-ranking Conservative politicians have been among the most vocal critics of the Prime Minister’s funding shake-up. Molly added:\n“That some of the loudest critical voices against Theresa May’s plans are coming from Conservative politicians is as much a failure of a weak and divided Labour Party to provide a united opposition as it is a signal of just how destructive the cuts will be.”\n“Greens have pledged to invest £7billion in the education system to fill the funding gap created by years of underinvestment and cuts and so create an education system that can positively transform lives [6].

Dr Scott Cato says that exiting the single market, leaving the customs union and ending free movement will all hit small businesses hard.\nA new report by the Federation of Small Business (FSB) [1] paints a mixed picture of the potential impacts for small businesses of leaving the EU. However, the FSB recognises that 92% of small business exports go to the EU, but a third of small businesses surveyed for the report expect a decrease in their exports as a result of the UK leaving the EU. Around 1 in 5 of FSB members employ at least one or more non-UK EU citizens and the organisation acknowledges the importance of being able to continue accessing appropriately skilled workers for jobs that they create. Molly Scott Cato said:\n“Small businesses are the bedrock of the local and regional economy. They account for more than 99% of all businesses in the UK and small and medium sized businesses (SMEs) between them employ almost 16 million people; 60% of the private sector workforce [2]. With such a huge percentage of their exports going into the EU single market, withdrawal from this market is clearly going to have a massive impact on thousands of UK workers.\n“Many small firms are also heavily reliant on mid-skill and unskilled workers; the very people who will not be covered by agreements over employment quotas if we lose freedom of movement.\n“Furthermore, the costs of meeting new bureaucratic requirements if we leave the customs union will make exports unviable at a small scale.\n“So, the extreme form of Brexit that the government is pushing for will have hugely negative impacts on thousands of small businesses and millions of workers. But this is not what we were told would happen as a result of leaving the EU. No one voted for a decline in our exports and loss of jobs. It is clear that the Tories can no longer claim to be the Party of business”.\nEarlier today, Dr Scott Cato met with the EU and International chair of the FSB, Ken Moon, to discuss concerns his members have about the UK leaving the EU, the single market and the customs union.\n[2] http://www.fsb.org.uk/media-centre/small-business-statistics",

The rules would apply even if the person came to the UK legally and had been living and working here for decades.\nThe petition from homelessness charity Crisis has almost 50,000 signatures. It is part of a campaign backed by over 70 homelessness organisations who have signed an open letter calling on the government to shelve the new plans, which it describes as a “a damaging policy that will risk further exploitation for people sleeping rough”.\nGreen Councillor Carla Denyer said:\n“The Home office’s new rules will effectively punish people for being homeless and lead to homeless people avoiding seeking support for fear of risking removal. That these changes are taking place in the middle of winter as thousands face losing their jobs is even worse.\n“Criminalising homelessness in this way could result in migrants being pushed into exploitative or dangerous work to avoid the risk of being forced to leave the country, and risks making it harder for victims of domestic violence to seek help. To tackle homelessness, rough sleepers need our support – not to be further stigmatised and criminalised.”\nThe same week (Tuesday December 15th) fellow Green Councillor Fi Hance spoke at a panel event run by campaign group Bristol student action for refugees which campaigns for the government to end indefinite immigration detention. Students from across the UK attended to hear stories from asylum seekers who have suffered as a result of Home Office policies.\nSpeaking after the event, Fi said: “The government’s stated intention to create a hostile environment is inhumane and cruel. Asylum seekers in the UK face appalling threats, from indefinite detention in terrible conditions to being removed from the country if they are found to be homeless. And government rules even prevent them from seeking work while waiting for a decision on an asylum claim. This is no way for a civilised society to behave.”\n“Campaigners like City of Sanctuary are calling on local authorities to follow the recent example of Haringey and not cooperate with the Home Office over these new rules.

In a question to the meeting, Councillor Fodor said: “Other authorities have proven the ways green bonds, in the form of the model called Community Mutual Investments (CMIs) can successfully pull in sums in a few months like £1m per call from private and local savers. These have a low risk, being publicly backed bonds, but a modest and hopefully reliable return to all the savers. What commitment is there to initiate such opportunities for Bristol savers to help create carbon saving projects with council support?”\nIn response Cabinet member Kye Dudd said the Council was looking into the idea but was noncommittal and did not provide specific details, although he did suggest public bonds might be part of the eventual City Leap offer to fund community projects.\nCommunity Municipal Investments (CMIs) are a way to fund local infrastructure projects through low risk, publically backed investment bonds that provide local savers with a modest but reliable return (e.g. 1.2% per year). Warrington Borough Council has used CMIs to raise £1 million to fund a new hybrid solar-storage farm, and West Berkshire Council raised £1 million to fund new rooftop solar power on council-owned buildings. Councillor Fodor has submitted motions on the issue to previous council meetings.\nSpeaking after the meeting, Councillor Fodor said he was glad that the cabinet member had recognised the potential of CMIs but frustrated by the lack of a commitment to take the idea any further and put local savings into local projects in a city renowned for its strong social and ethical investment sector. He said:\n“I was a bit disappointed by the response from the administration. Here’s a chance to use a tried and tested method that could channel a million pounds or more into renewable energy solutions within a few months, putting local savings into local projects. It’s worked in two other councils already this year and gives savers and others a low risk way of making practical projects possible.”\n“Through City Leap the council has already spent millions of pounds chasing speculative bids from large companies and yet we still don’t have anything on the table – in the meantime why not get to work on our own green energy projects funded by local savers?”\nNotes\nOn Community Municipal Investments\nCommunity Municipal Investments are a low-risk funding model developed by Leeds University and Abundance Investments platform with UK Government and EU support. The research project had the support of four local authorities including Bristol City Council.

Opportunities for the community to contribute have been mentioned but not pursued, except independently by the successful Bristol Energy Co-operative.\nIt is hoped that City Leap will eventually bring carbon savings to the city and a return to the investment being discussed today.

The new Single Use Plastics Directive will also force tobacco producers to pay for the collection of cigarette butts and introduce collection targets for drinks bottles along with a requirement to redesign drinks caps to tether them to bottles. The Directive also includes a Green proposal for a complete ban on oxo-degradable plastic, which is often labelled as biodegradable but in reality fragments into microplastics.\nYesterday the UK government also unveiled its own strategy to tackle plastic waste, laying out plans to simplify household recycling, make retailers and packaging manufacturers pay for collection and recycling and end food waste. However, critics of the UK’s plans point to concerns over voluntary action and distant targets. They also fear that consultation with manufacturers and retailers could result in the plans being watered down.\nMolly responded:\n“The starting gun has been fired in a race to the top on single-use plastics. It’s clear the EU is out in front while the UK is being weighed down by further consultation, held back by industry lobbyists, and staggering towards a way too distant finishing line. The EU is prepared to make tracks now and get tough on manufacturers and retailers through outright bans on a range of single-use plastics and setting tight targets. This is a great early Christmas present for the planet.\n“Michael Gove’s rhetoric about how the UK can outperform the EU on a green agenda has suffered another setback.

This is also our chance to build back better, making our streets healthier, safer and more pleasant – returning them to their place as the heart of our communities.”\n“As lockdown measures lift we are beginning to see worrying increases in congestion, road accidents and air pollution. We know that people who have to breathe dirty air are more likely to be badly affected by coronavirus so we have to act now if we are going to protect communities across our city.”\nCities across the country and across the world have been taking radical steps to improve their streets for walkers and cyclists in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.

Following weeks of calls from councillors, the Council will soon be launching a webpage allowing residents and councillors to feed in ideas for where changes are needed, but sadly this comes too late to benefit from the government’s first funding offer.\nCouncillor Combley continued:\n“Local communities know best what changes need to be made on their streets and the streets around their homes. I would encourage everyone to send in their ideas once the council’s webpage is finally up and running. It is a missed opportunity that communities haven’t yet been able to feed in their ideas and potentially benefit from the governments first funding offer. Local communities must be at the centre of suggested improvements going forward.”\n“I will continue to support the good work that has been started, and to call for the plans to improve pedestrian and cycling infrastructure to go further and faster. We believe that everyone in Bristol should be able to live on streets that are safe, healthy centres of communities.”\nNotes\nPhoto by Martyna Bober on Unsplash",

This is a public health issue, not a political one and it is outrageous the Tories are using the general election as an excuse to put the brakes on taking action.\n“Whatever government is elected on 8th June, action is urgently needed. There can be no excuses for delay while hundreds of thousands of children are educated within 150 metres of toxic diesel fumes and almost two thirds of the population live in areas where levels of nitrogen dioxide pollution exceed legal limits. Our air quality crisis is linked to more than 2,000 needless deaths across the South West and almost 6% of all deaths in Bristol every year.\n“That it is the European Commission and ClientEarth having to drag the government through the courts to account for a public health crisis is a shameful indictment of the Conservatives’ irresponsible and deadly apathy. The government readily acknowledges that any positive air quality action it has been forced to take has been driven by EU law. But the Prime Minister’s plans for an extreme Brexit puts those vital EU safeguards at risk.”\nEnvironmental lawyers Client Earth won a High Court challenge against the Environment Secretary Andrea Leadsom last November over her failure to take measures that would bring the UK into compliance with EU air quality laws. The court set the Minister a deadline of 24th April to produce a new plan. The European Commission also sent a ‘final warning’ to the UK in February over its failure to address repeated breaches of legal air pollution limits in 16 areas of the country.",

Darren Hall, representing the Green Party, offered a hopeful vision of the future, one where structural inequalities are challenged and women’s, often hidden, contributions are recognised.\nOn women and the economy, both the Conservative candidate, and the incumbent Liberal Democrat MP, looked backwards, lauding the so-called achievements of their government, including the claim that falling unemployment means women are better off.\nThe complacency of this attitude was firmly rebuffed by Green candidate Darren Hall as he commented on the huge distance to go locally, nationally, and globally in terms of gender equality. He called for recognition of the unpaid work that women do and a reversal of the austerity agenda, highlighting The Fawcett Society’s report ‘Cutting Women Out in Bristol’, which demonstrates how cuts have affected women disproportionately. Whilst unemployment figures have fallen, recent data shows 2.3% of those ‘employed’ are on zero-hours contracts, with no guaranteed hours, sick or maternity pay. People on these contracts are more likely to be women. Such data lends the lie to the coalition claim that women are better off under their government.\nDarren Hall outlined the Green Party’s agenda for action on women’s economic inequality, including flagship Green Party policy on the living wage, greater investment in public services, mandatory equal pay auditing, and a motion passed at conference for free childcare from 12 months.\nA question on violence against women led Labour candidate, Thangam Debbonaire, to critique the coalition government for cutting funding for women’s services. Yet Darren pointed out the hypocrisy of this: under Labour too, Britain faces more cuts, which will adversely affect women, such as Labour’s pledge to cap child benefit. Darren not only rejected austerity economics, but also put forward the Green Party policy of investing in statutory personal and social education in schools, as a way to reduce violence against women. On the subject of asylum seekers’ rights Darren was clear that the Green Party would end their traumatic, inhumane, and totally unnecessary detention. He called for increased funding for vital services, such as the Bristol Refugee Rights Centre.\nAs for the effect of cuts to legal aid on women, Darren Hall outlined Green Party policy for a total reversal of these cuts. Labour’s Thangam Debbonaire dodged the question, suggesting those in need should seek legal advice from their trade union. Liberal Democrat, Stephen Williams, was at least honest in explaining that all three establishment parties agreed on cuts to legal aid, in his own words: ‘I hated having to go along with it’. However, Lib Dem apologies and Labour’s sticking plaster solutions did not wash with the audience last night, and will be cold comfort indeed for the thousands of vulnerable women who are now finding justice is beyond their financial means. Legal aid cuts means many women are left with little choice but to stand as litigant in person in what Darren highlighted as an often acrimonious and macho legal process.\nThe Green Party’s strong agenda on justice, this time environmental, was spotlighted again with a discussion on the threat fracking poses to human health. Whilst the Lib-Lab-Con candidates fought over who could wheedle and excuse the most, Darren Hall outlined the Green Party’s no ifs no buts anti-fracking stance. Fracking is risky and polluting, and the evidence is clear: fossil fuels need to stay in the ground if two degree global warming is to be avoided. A flurry of applause signalled the audience’s approval.\nAs the debate concluded with summary statements, Darren offered a parting thought: a vote for one of the three main parties ensures that, no matter who wins, very little will change. Moving forwards means stepping away from the centre and joining the Green surge to create a progressive and just society, where people, regardless of gender, race or class, are treated as valuable equals.\n[With thanks to Rowan Quarry for providing photos for this event]",

The latest poll published at the weekend shows that the Liberal Democrat vote in Bristol West is collapsing into a distant third place, and the Conservatives never had any chance here anyway. So now the General Election in Bristol West is between the Green Party and the Labour Party. It is going to be close, so if you want a Green MP every single vote for the Green Party really will count!\nThe Green Party will never support a Conservative government or a Conservative-led Coalition. All the polls continue to point to a hung parliament at Westminster, with no party having an overall majority. The latest predictions are that the Labour Party will be the largest party in parliament after the General Election and so will be likely to form a government. But in order to do so, they will need the support of other parties, including the Green Party. If Bristol West can send another Green MP to Westminster, the Green Party will have a strong voice if as expected there is a Labour minority administration.\nThe Green Party will not enter into a formal coalition with the Labour Party, but we will give our support to them on an issue by issue basis on the many areas where we agree. So for example, if the Labour Party promotes legislation to protect the NHS, we will support them, whilst at the same time pushing them to go further and stop all privatisation of the NHS (which their current policy does not do); if they decide to bring part of the railways back into public ownership (Labour’s policy is unclear on this) we will support them but push them further to bring the railways back into full public ownership; but if they continue to support fracking or TTIP we will not support them. In this way we will exert pressure on the Labour Party to adopt a stronger social and environmental agenda, particularly on climate change.\nOn May 7th, Bristol West will have either a Green MP or a Labour one, so either way Bristol West will have an anti-Tory MP. Therefore there is no danger of this not happening if you vote Green. But if you support a more radical approach to politics in Bristol and Westminster, voting Green will put pressure on the Labour party to do so too.\nStill unsure how to vote? Well, if you want the Green Party to win, Bristol Greens are pushing at the door of parliament in Westminster, so vote Green! If you don’t want Labour to win, vote Green! If you want a radical voice for social and environmental policies in parliament, Vote Green this Thursday 7th May!",

However, it is deeply concerning that university teaching now appears to be subject to government monitoring in a way that challenges academic freedom.

Reports suggest that 90% of the city was damaged or destroyed and the death toll is 446 and expected to rise, with hundreds of thousands of people displaced.

  "https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_/https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_greens-launch-new-strategy-for-addressing-bristols-housing-crisis/content_575.html": "menu\nGreens today unveiled a new strategy for tackling Bristol’s housing crisis; one they say contains the ‘building blocks for a housing revolution’ in the city. Molly Scott Cato, Green Party candidate for Bristol West, and Tony Dyer, candidate in Bristol South, will launch the new housing strategy this Friday at HAB Housing in Bristol, the firm of architects set up by TV celebrity architect Kevin McCloud.\nThe two parliamentary candidates, who jointly wrote the new report, will focus particularly on ‘a new settlement for renters’ which promises protections enjoyed by tenants in other parts of Europe and in Scotland. Mike Roberts, of HAB Housing, will also talk at the launch.\nGreens want to see a move away from short-term tenancies, enabling renters to stay in their home as long as they pay their rent and abide by their contract, and a ‘living rent’ where rents are capped to within one third of the take home pay of the average household. They also call for new powers for the city council and mayor in regulating the local rental market, as in many cities across Europe. Tony Dyer said:\n“Private renters in the UK suffer from some of the weakest protections in Europe. With no rent controls, the median rent in Bristol last year was £850 per month, around half the average take- home pay for the city. Young people are hit particularly hard by such eye-watering rents, forcing many to rent a room in a shared house, unable to get a place of their own. Small wonder 10,000 private renters in Bristol need housing benefit to make ends meet.\n“With tenancies lasting 6 or 12 months, renters are vulnerable to eviction and sudden rent rises. End of tenancy is now the leading cause of homelessness in England, and landlords issued 1,160 possession notices in Bristol last year.\n“We need a new settlement for renters, bringing them protections enjoyed in other parts of Europe. The Scottish government is taking steps to help renters; England must too.”\nThe Green’s strategy rejects the argument that the housing crisis can be solved simply by building lots of new homes. They blame Bristol’s housing crisis on ‘treating homes as investments’ and the sell-off and a lack of investment in new council homes. It highlights that for every £1 the Government spends on low rent homes, it spends £23 fuelling the private market. Molly Scott Cato said:\n“It’s not that we have failed to build enough homes in Bristol, it’s that housing has become about investments rather than about a space to live. Developers flog off their new flats in Bristol to investors before they’re even built. An obscene feature of this market is the fact investors use offshore companies to avoid tax and hide their identity. It is estimated that offshore companies have gobbled up £1.2 billion of property in Bristol. It’s clear that simply building more homes in this broken market isn’t going to fix the problems of extortionate rents or exorbitant house prices. We certainly will need more homes as the population of Bristol grows, but we cannot simply build our way out of the problem.”\nThe Greens housing strategy calls for an end to tax breaks for landlords’ mortgages and schemes like Help to Buy. They say that public money currently going towards these schemes should instead be put towards delivering more genuinely affordable housing. They also call for the council to be free to borrow prudently to build new council housing and to use its large land holdings and pension fund to back community-led approaches like Community Land Trusts, co-operatives and cohousing.\nMolly Scott Cato concluded:\n“As Green MP I would work to put in place the building blocks of a housing revolution in Bristol, working with residents and campaign groups to make the case for creating a fairer housing market, where younger and older generations; home owners or renters, all have equal opportunities for decent affordable homes.”",

In this regard the agreement reached between the EU and UK demonstrates that Barnier and Tusk are doing a much better job protecting those they represent than Davis and May are on our behalf.\n“They identified early on that the rights of citizens of the EU27, including Irish citizens and businesses, were vulnerable and have acted to protect them. They also ensured that commitments already made to fund projects across the EU would not be damaged by the UK’s withdrawal and a potential hole in the budget.\n“By contrast, the Tories are being driven by blind ideology that will serve only a tiny minority of financiers, tax avoiders and regulation burners and are allowing the rights and freedoms of the vast majority of UK citizens to be fatally undermined.”\n“This Brextremist agenda and the fact we are still in the dark on what a future relationship between the EU and UK will look like means people must have the final say.

Green councillors have released their response (attached) which challenges the expansion of the airport due to its impact on the climate and the local area and argues that it should not be allowed.\nSouthville Councillor Stephen Clarke, lead author on the Green group’s response, said:\n“This enormous planned expansion of Bristol Airport from 8m passengers per year to 12m comes at exactly the same time as Bristol has just agreed to aim for carbon neutrality by 2030 and at exactly the wrong time for the planet. The planned expansion would hugely impact on both the area around the airport and the people of Bristol. It would lead to additional congestion on the A38 and surrounding rural roads, tarmac over Green Belt land for car parks, permit around 4000 night flights disturbing sleep, and release a large quantity of local air pollution which could potentially cause severe health issues.\n“This massive increase in carbon emissions is totally incompatible with our need to reduce emissions as fast as possible to avoid the most dangerous levels of climate breakdown. This expansion must not be allowed.”\nGreen councillor candidate for North Somerset Bridget Petty said:\n“Bristol airport is not well enough connected to public transport to handle this growth, so expansion will cause a massive increase in car traffic. The airport is already large enough to serve the community well and it doesn’t need to be bigger. 12 million passengers are referred to in the planning application but the airport’s master plan is to increase numbers to 20 million and that is just scary, for its impact on the local area as well as on the global climate.\n“As a parent, I fear for the future of my children if reckless decisions about growth are made without considering the lasting consequences. We know that air travel is a massive contributor to climate change – this kind of important decision must be considered by more than a small group of individuals. Now is the time for people to get involved and have their say on the airport’s expansion plans.”\nBackground\n– The planning application can be found here.\n– Climate campaigners Extinction Rebellion have created a guide to responding to the planning application which can be found here.",

They were responding to an item on the Labour Mayor’s so-called ‘bus deal’, which one councillor said was little different to the approach of previous administrations – “an assortment of tweaks to help unblock the bus network” in return for non-binding promises from the bus networks’ private operators.\nCouncillor Martin Fodor submitted a statement to the meeting, as well as questions asking how the proposed ‘bus deal’ would actually work. He argued that only tackling Bristol’s chronic traffic congestion would significantly improve public transport.\nIn December last year First Bus Chairman James Freeman said that he was unable to make a business case for investment in more buses for Bristol until the City’s congestion problem was dealt with. At the last Council Budget Meeting (February 2019) Green councillors proposed an amendment to generate at least £6m annual investment into Bristol’s buses, funded by a congestion charge on cars from outside the city.\nSpeaking outside the Cabinet meeting, Councillor Fodor said:\n“I’ve heard the Mayor and his various Cabinet members for Transport announce the forthcoming ‘Bristol Bus Deal’ about half a dozen times now, so I was keen to see at last how it will help us get the better buses the city needs.\n“But what we have today is barely even a plan – all we’ve got is a proposal for a document [an MoU] that could be agreed with bus companies – who might then commit to investing more – if the city then creates a series of piecemeal route improvement projects which would all need to come back to Cabinet for each project to get funding. Nothing is funded or agreed and we don’t know what measures might be put in place if they get a budget – this is hardly a blueprint for better buses, let alone a ‘Bus Deal’.\n“At the end of the day we aren’t going to get significantly better, cheaper or more reliable buses while they’re still bogged down in traffic – it’s the number one reason they’re delayed. There is already too much congestion for our buses to run smoothly today and tinkering around the edges like this will have little impact. What we need is bold action to reduce the amount of cars on Bristol’s roads – something none of the other parties are prepared to contemplate.\n“Greens proposed a budget amendment last February that would fund better buses while also reducing traffic from out of town commuters with a congestion charge. The Mayor and other parties voted against it – but Greens know that improving public transport in a fast-growing city like Bristol means not being afraid to make big decisions.”\nBackground\nCouncillor Fodor’s statement and questions can be found in the Public Forum pack attached here.",

At the national level, an all-party Parliamentary Commission is a key first step in achieving justice and starting the conversations we need to have as a society about our past and present – I think it’s right that reparations is part of that conversation.”\nDiscussing reparations, Cleo added:\n“This isn’t just about monetary compensation, it goes much wider than that and is a movement that has existed for centuries, ever since the first transgressions of our humanity as African heritage people. The first step is an acknowledgement by the British state that what happened was wrong and a formal apology should follow – this is an essential step to repair, as so far our experiences of historic and ongoing wrongs have been denied. We also need to see an active commitment from the government to prevent further injustice.”\nCleo also urged members of the public who support the motion to submit statements to the council meeting. She said:\n“This motion is significant, timely and historic. It represents good democracy in that it combines grass roots activism and movements such as ‘Stop The Maangamizi Campaign’ with the political system. The time has come to right the wrongs that plague society and keep it from being equal and equitable.

In response, the Mayor said the letter was simply a factual response ‘commenting on’ elements of the airport’s expansion plans such as the car parking changes.\nThe official letter, (see below) sent by Marvin Rees and Kye Dudd to North Somerset in June 2019, states that Bristol Council “supports the important role the airport plays in connecting the West of England and wider South West to global destinations” and repeats approvingly the airport’s claims regarding positive economic impacts. Following this, Councillor Clarke asked the Mayor several times to state his own position on the airport’s expansion, but the Mayor refused to answer; the third occasion he has done so after being asked by Green councillors.\nThe Mayor’s support for airport expansion, which would see passenger numbers increase from the current 8.6 million per year to 12 million and then to 20 million and cause a significant increase in pollution, noise and congestion was initially based on a report by the airport listing the supposed economic benefits. The respected think-tank New Economics Foundation, were commissioned to examine the airport’s report and concluded starkly that it “significantly overstated” the economic benefits.\nCouncillor Clarke states “We are approaching decision making time in this application. A lot has changed since the Mayor and Cllr. Kye Dudd wrote their letter of support for the expansion in April last year: multiple warnings from scientists, floods around the world and of course the ongoing fires in Australia. This is possibly the biggest decision that this region will take in the battle against climate change – the carbon emissions from the expansion alone are nearly the same as the whole of Bristol’s emissions. I appeal to Marvin Rees to show leadership in the face of the Climate Emergency he has declared, retract his support, and write a letter of objection to the airport’s plans.”\nComment on Bristol Airport’s planning application below from Marvin Rees and Kye Dudd:",

Meanwhile, fracking exploration would be allowed under ‘permitted development’, with no planning process at all.\nThe letter states that the government’s proposals amount to “an unacceptable abuse of the planning process” designed simply in order to over-ride local opposition to fracking. Councillors and activists from ‘Grandparents for a safe earth‘ gathered at 2pm on the 9th October at College Green in Bristol to demonstrate and sign the letter.\nThe letter (full text here) also notes that:\n– The government’s change would mean that fracking exploration had the same level of planning control as a small domestic building extension, which would make it far more difficult for local communities to oppose and inevitably open the door to significant expansion of fracking\n– There is still little knowledge of what impact fracking has on water supplies, ground pollution or geological integrity (for example it may cause earthquakes)\n– Parliament’s Housing, Communities and Local Government Committee has urged these plans to be dropped, calling the proposals ‘hugely harmful’\n– Government surveys suggest that just 18% of the population supports fracking and even a majority of conservative councillors (65%) oppose the government’s plans\n– Research suggests fracking expansion would need to be on a huge scale to impact on energy supplies – to replace 50% of gas imports would require one new well to be drilled every day for the next fifteen years\nCouncillor Eleanor Combley, leader of the Green group on Bristol City Council, said:\n“It’s outrageous the government is trying to circumvent planning law to so they can push fracking expansion on communities, giving fracking exploration the same level of planning control as a garden shed and taking the decision over fracking projects away from locally accountable elected representatives.\n“We know that people in Britain do not want fracking. We know that fracking can be a source of air and water pollution harmful to human health. We know that to have a chance of reducing the impact of climate change we need to keep fossil fuels in the ground. Yet in the face of all this evidence, our national government is hell bent on fracking anyway, and removing any safeguards which might allow people to protect their local area. That’s why Green and Independent councillors from across the West of England have come together to oppose this change, and protect people’s right to object to fracking.\n“Instead of finding ways to push fracking on communities that don’t want it the government should support renewable energy – in the UK we have the expertise and potential for a green energy revolution which could provide up to a million jobs and clean, cheap energy for the whole country.”\nBackground info:\n– The government’s consultations close on 25 October and can be viewed at https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/permitted-development-for-shale-gas-exploration and https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/inclusion-of-shale-gas-production-projects-in-the-nationally-significant-infrastructure-project-nsip-regime\n– Fracking has been banned in every part of the UK except England.

The two amendments would provide funding for calmer and safer streets, upgrading parks and green spaces and develop plans for a liveable neighbourhood in the BS3 area of South Bristol. By making it more convenient and pleasant for people to shop and travel without driving in their local neighbourhoods, the amendments would also help the city reduce its overall carbon emissions.\nThe budget amendments, proposed by Green Councillors Martin Fodor and Tony Dyer, will be debated and voted on at the Full Council budget meeting on Tuesday 21 February.\nMartin Fodor’s amendment seeks to take £4m of unallocated developer contributions (CIL), held in reserve by the Labour administration, and spend it over four years on local street and parks improvements to support neighbourhoods with the pressure of future growth.\nSpeaking about his amendment, Councillor Fodor said:\n“As the city grows we need to make its streets and parks fit for the future. This amendment uses funds that have been sitting unspent and unallocated for years, to invest in helping neighbourhoods cope with the extra demands, people and vehicles. For too long there’s been a shortage of investment in local neighbourhoods around Bristol which are under pressure from development, while the Labour administration has continued to accumulate the bulk of these funds in a large centrally held pot.\n“The impact of development is unequal and this funding can help Bristol’s communities cope with the pressures of growth. In our parks this could be used to make them more accessible, add play equipment, drinking fountains, toilets or facilities for traders, or improve and maintain paths as they get busier.”\nHe added,\n“Investments in local streets would help make them safer and reduce the impact of more traffic, improving wellbeing by funding improvements like crossings, safe cycle storage, and planting new trees to provide shade and flood relief.”\nSouthville Councillor Tony Dyer’s amendment would use unallocated transport improvement funds to develop a plan for a liveable neighbourhood in South Bristol. WECA granted Bristol Council £10m for two liveable neighbourhoods over a year ago but so far just one is being developed, in East Bristol – Councillor Dyer’s amendment would use £800K of the funds to draw up a plan and business case for a liveable neighbourhood for the BS3 area of South Bristol, which would then be delivered using funding from local developer contributions and other transport related funds.\nSpeaking about his amendment, Tony said:\n“In January 2022 WECA allocated £10m to Bristol for two liveable neighbourhoods. However the Labour administration have only brought forward plans for one, and used most of the remaining money for relatively low level street changes instead. This amendment would use remaining funds – money not allocated to anything else – to help develop a liveable neighbourhood as originally intended in South Bristol, in the BS3 area also sometimes called Greater Bedminster.\n“Greater Bedminster is just outside the Clean Air Zone, has a key strategic route (the A38), and over the next 10 to 20 years this part of Bristol will see some of the highest levels of development anywhere in the city. In my own ward of Southville the number of homes is expected to almost double. With limited street space, parking and traffic are already problems for many residents here – so work needs to start soon to support both existing communities and future residents.”\nLiveable Neighbourhoods, very similar to the ‘Low Traffic Neighbourhoods’ being developed by many councils in the UK, are areas of a city designed to be people-centred and support walking and cycling, and reduce residential streets being used as through roads by commuter traffic. (see notes for more)\nCouncillor Dyer added,\n“Local people have been asking for action on traffic and parking for some years now. By developing a liveable neighbourhood in South Bristol as originally planned, we can deliver streets that are safe, accessible and pleasant places to be, boost the local economy, and improve people’s health and quality of life, reducing air pollution and traffic incidents. By making it easier to walk and cycle a liveable neighbourhood here could also reduce traffic in other parts of Bristol.\n“This is a great opportunity to deliver changes that are desperately needed in South Bristol at no extra cost – we really need to just get on with it!”\nNotes\nCllr Martin Fodor is the Chair of the Environment and Sustainability Committee\nMore about MartinCllr Tony Dyer is the Leader of Bristol City Council\nMore about Tony",

It is already inspiring that the University of Bristol has committed to becoming a carbon neutral campus by 2030, but the University of Bristol can do more than that. Bristol could join with Universities around the world, including the University of Glasgow in the UK, and take an inspiring lead in divesting from fossil fuels. I am pleased to say they would also be joining Bristol City Council in making this pledge.\nThe University’s Cabot Institute is one of the worlds most respected centres for fundamental research on the risks and uncertainties of our changing climate. The institute hosted an excellent series of talks on climate change over the last few months, that have reminded all of us of the need for bold and decisive action.

The university’s promise amounts to thinking about withdrawing investment from some of the worst polluters at some point in the future. This doesn’t go far enough and isn’t really good enough for a university which recently won a Green Capital Public Sector Award for sustainability4.”\n“I am proud that a year ago Bristol City Council committed to halting investment in the fossil fuel industry after Green councillor Charlie Bolton raised the issue with the Mayor5. It would be exciting to see Bristol University also show leadership by making sure that its endowment fund helps to build a green and sustainable future.

This is the gap between those with and without easy access to computers and the internet – something which has become a lifeline for many as more parts of our lives have shifted online during the lockdown.\nFor children in families that have no computer or just share a single laptop, or that have poor internet access, keeping up with schoolwork from home can be difficult or impossible, and educational inequalities are likely to have increased during the pandemic.(1) Meanwhile seniors who are self-isolating but lack internet access or can’t afford a tablet have found themselves suddenly cut off from their communities and family, and unable to access the online events that have emerged during lockdown.\nIn May, Green Councillor Cleo Lake launched the #GiveNTech campaign, working with Avon Fire & Rescue, Bristol Waste and local charity DigiLocal. The initiative aims to collect, refurbish and distribute unused IT hardware. Donations such as old laptops or tablets are collected, wiped of data, cleaned, fixed and given to those who need them. Councillor Lake has been pressing Bristol Council departments and more recently WECA (the regional authority) for support to ramp up the project and help it to reach the many more people who experience digital exclusion.\nDigiLocal have been partners on the project wiping and reformatting laptops whilst Bristol Waste have assisted with PAT testing.\nMimi, a single parent in Ashley, discussed how the scheme had made a difference to her family. She said:\n“It was so helpful to us as a family to receive the laptop, particularly in this time when the schools are shut. It’s allowed my son to access study materials online and helped us to be able to keep in touch with family both in the UK and overseas which has really helped to keep my mind at rest. It’s also helped me with being able to access services and support over lockdown and, as a single parent, those resources have been invaluable to both my son and I.”\nCleo said:\n“As well as providing laptops for children, I have also been assisting elders to get online which has been a joy – it has made a huge difference, with elders being able to socialise again, many of whom have not been outside of their homes since early March. I deliver a weekly creative dance exercise class via zoom and it’s been really nice connecting together – it is just obvious how this boosts wellbeing on many levels.”\nCleo added:\n“Whilst the Government seems quite adamant on sending children back to school as a priority in September, we still have to reserve an element of wait and see, and in any case there may well be parents who decide that they will continue to home school their children in the short or longer term. And even when the pandemic is long gone, a lack of access to digital resources will continue to hurt the life chances of children in poor families all over Bristol.\n“But whether for school children or elders, we still need many more laptops to meet demand for the campaign. Anyone with ideas or laptops please do get in touch, any and all support is welcomed. Residents in my own ward of Cotham have been particularly helpful having donated the largest number of laptops. Thank You Cotham!”\nPeople or organisations wishing to support the campaign or donate old IT hardware should contact Cleo Lake at cllr.cleo.lake@bristol.gov.uk.\nImage: Cllr Lake helping Ashley resident Hazel get connected to the internet with a new laptop.\nNotes\n1) Researchers have suggested that educational inequalities between children from poorer and wealthier families are likely to be exacerbated by the lockdown.

It is not acceptable for Bristol to keep pushing back the issue of our air quality crisis. The Mayor continues to avoid decisions that actually improve our environment. His actions fall well short of the rhetoric of his words.”\n“The city has already fallen 1 year behind the likes of Birmingham, Leeds and Bath who are implementing action on air quality. Not only are these cities complying with the law but they understand the importance of public health for their citizens.”\n“The Mayor’s lack of action also misses the benefits of implementing a Clean Air Zone. Improved health – especially for the poorest in the Inner city who are far more likely to suffer – must be prioritised. Implementing a Clean Air Zone can also generate income that could be invested in public transport, cycling and walking, giving people real choice in how they travel across the city. It is time for action, not just words,” he concluded.\nResearch has shown that air pollution particularly affects the most vulnerable in society: children and older people, and those with heart and lung conditions. The annual health cost of the impacts of poor air quality in Bristol is estimated at £83m [2].\nThe threat of legal action to Bristol City Council comes from central government, who wrote to the Mayor in July giving a deadline of 30th September for the council to submit further plans on how it would bring the city into line with national legal limits by 2025. The letter, from Therese Coffey MP, Junior Minister for Air Quality in DEFRA stated: “I would like to make clear that any delay or non-compliance with the September and December deadlines will result in me being forced to consider legal action against Bristol City Council which may include issuing proceedings without further notice.” [3]\nGreens have stated their intention to continue to monitor and call for immediate action to address the air quality crisis, including clear options to implement restrictions on private vehicles in the city centre.\nENDS\n[2] https://www.cleanairforbristol.org/what-is-air-pollution/air-pollution-and-health/\n[3] The letter, from Therese Coffey MP, Junior Minister forAir Quality in DEFRA, was written to Marvin Rees on 23rd July and can be found here.\nhttps://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/823849/air-quality-letter-bristol-city-council-20190723.pdf",

They agree that to achieve this, farmers will need to receive at least as much money as they currently get through the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). However, they say direct payments based on land area should be scrapped and retargeted at paying farmers for the public benefits they provide. They also call for additional funding for advice, training, and farmer-led research and innovation.\nOther more radical ideas from Simon Fairlie include a shift away from export markets so UK farmers can focus on meeting UK demands for food; 20% VAT on processed meat products, and ‘polluter pays’ labelling on food products which involve the use of artificial fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides and GM materials. Meanwhile the Soil Association calls for a new national agroforestry strategy, a ban on the routine preventative use of antibiotics, and using procurement to drive demand for locally produced, especially organic, food.\nThis event will include a keynote speech by Dr Scott Cato MEP followed by an overview of the two reports by their respective authors, and contributions from an expert panel.\nFor more information and to sign up to the event please click here.",

By using data from country by country reporting, a transparency requirement recently established under EU law, Oxfam were able to investigate the activities of banks. Molly points to the advances made in the EU in tackling tax avoidance, but also calls for country by country reporting to be extended to all sectors. She said:\n“These revelations are the result of Greens pushing for country-by-country reporting (CBCR) for banks. It shows how CBCR, which forces banks to publish information such as turnover, staffing, profits and the amount of tax paid, is a useful and powerful tool in helping to identify and crack down on tax avoidance. We now need to see this measure extended to all sectors.”\nMolly also warned about the future of the UK outside the EU:\n“At a time when the EU is beginning to implement rules which are clamping down on tax dodging, Theresa May has indicated she is willing to establish the UK as a low tax economy.

Nothing has been done to prepare for the economic storm on the horizon.\nIn the Autumn Statement, Osborne insisted that “Britain’s economic plan is working” and that the Coalition Government is overseeing a “responsible recovery.”\nIn response to the Autumn Statement, Natalie Bennett, Green Party Leader for England and Wales, said:\n“Mr Osborne was so keen to claim that this was an Autumn Statement for the long term, yet on this issue, as others, he is clearly a man who protests too much.\n“Our current economic position is based on high and growing consumer indebtedness, as households are forced to borrow to cover basic costs, and a government-supported housing bubble. The Chancellor says that the sun is shining. Well that proves he hasn’t looked out the window today, or looked into the lives of millions of Britons who are struggling to pay the bills, in far too many cases forced to resort to extortionate payday lenders or foodbanks to get by.”\n“Instead of working to restructure our economy, to rein-in our reckless, fraud-ridden financial sector, to boost manufacturers and the real economy, to create stable, decent-paying jobs that workers can build a life on, Mr Osborne’s focus is instead clearly short-term – to inflate the economy for the mere 18 months to the next General Election.”\nCaroline Lucas, Green MP for Brighton Pavilion, said:\n“The Autumn statement was yet another missed opportunity to take the action that we need that will genuinely move us to a low-carbon, affordable energy future.”\n“The Chancellor has done nothing to tackle the root causes of fuel poverty or soaring fuel bills. Instead of watering down energy companies’ obligations, he should have announced a major programme to make all homes super-energy efficient. If funded through recycled carbon taxes, this could bring an estimated nine out of ten homes out of fuel poverty, quadruple carbon savings, and create up to 200,000 jobs across the UK.” [1]\n“The Chancellor has delivered a lavish Christmas gift to fracking companies – giving them tax breaks to support an irresponsible and dangerous dash for gas that will undermine the urgent action we need to reduce our carbon emissions.”\n“It’s ironic that a Chancellor who talks about going green is quite happy for the UK to continue to fund massive subsidies for both nuclear and fossil fuels.

Many struggle with high and increasing rents as well as sub-standard living conditions, and due to their often precarious living circumstances may be reluctant to come forward to report problems or seek support, which can also lead to homelessness. Green Councillor Cleo Lake has raised concerns at new funding received by Bristol City Council which she fears could be used to further marginalise vulnerable and homeless migrants, betraying Bristol’s status as a ‘Sanctuary City’.\n£180,000 from the Government’s Controlling Migration Fund is going to the City Council to address migration (which includes people coming from the EEA) as well as a further sum of over £300,000, ostensibly to focus on rogue landlords. This will be done through a scheme where migrants are encouraged to report inadequate living conditions – but in doing so may then face deportation.\nThrough this fund not only will immigrant rough sleepers be supported to ‘accept offers of reconnection’ to their native lands, but the Home Office will also fund random raids of properties based on citizen ‘tip offs’ to deport immigrants under the guise of outlawing rogue landlords. To quote the BCC website:\n“The officers will work with partners including Avon and Somerset Police and Immigration Compliance Enforcement (ICE) to identify properties where there are likely to be high levels of exploitation and trafficking. Officers will carry out proactive inspections of these premises, using our powers of entry to gain access to all dwellings.…It is estimated that approximately 1,200 inspections will be undertaken over the two year period, equivalent to approximately 312 streets being covered across the city.”\nCleo Lake, Green party councillor for Cotham, posed a question at Cabinet on August 15th concerning the number of immigrant rough sleepers, requesting a breakdown of:\n– Place of origin\n– Immigration status and outcome\n– How many people were been brought off the street through the City Initiative\nCouncillor Lake says the follow up answer she eventually received gave her cause for concern:\n“EEA rough sleepers seen regularly by Bristol Outreach are ineligible to access supported pathways off the streets. Without realistic potential to find or sustain work e.g. because of substance misuse, many in time will accept an offer of reconnection. Once a client consents, it is more efficient to employ our written protocol with the Home Office to facilitate voluntary administrative removals. This joined-up approach provides the Home Office with valuable intelligence about potential returnees…. funding also provides for a full-time Bristol City Council Streetwise Officer specifically to:\n• build a stronger intelligence picture of migrant rough sleeping\n• liaise with ICE and Police to target detention of individuals subject to enforced removal\n• liaise with Outreach around supportive interventions/voluntary reconnection”\nCommenting on the response, Councillor Lake said:\n“The data given suggests that the vast majority of rough sleepers are UK citizens. Out of a recorded 295, 148 were recorded as ‘white British’, 8 as ‘Black’ or ‘Black British: African’ and 97 were ‘Origin Unknown’. The information goes on to suggest that there will be a target of “64 reconnections per year (total for enforced/voluntary administrative removals, voluntary reconnections), pro rata for first year.\n“Human trafficking and exploitation is extremely concerning and must be confronted, along with rogue landlords which the information suggests go hand in hand with this exploitation. It is only right to target rogue landlords – they are a blight on our community and should be challenged across the board. However homeless people are, by the very nature of their being, extremely vulnerable, and should have our unconditional support.\n“Whilst I do not condone illegal migration I am minded to also reflect on the reasons that people risk their lives and often put themselves into severe debt to come to the UK. Whether it’s to seek asylum, opportunity or to join family, Bristol is supposed to be a City of Sanctuary but it seems to me that there is a danger of a lack of separation between vital support and immigration enforcement which could jeopardise that City status. Support for homeless migrants or those living in substandard accommodation cannot come with the threat of deportation or we risk further marginalising some of the most vulnerable people in society. I hope that positives do come out of this but I will be watching closely to see what is really happening.”\nNB: Bristol was officially recognised as a City of Sanctuary in 2011 – for more information see https://bristol.cityofsanctuary.org/",

The prospect of leaving the EU is the single most significant decision this country has taken in my lifetime; it is reprehensible that it is being used as a weapon with which to fight internal Party battles.\n“The destructive shambles we find ourselves in as a nation is thanks almost entirely to the divisions inside the Tory Party, together with the savage and failed politics of austerity. And it is clear that many members of the cabinet are currently more interested in the scramble to be the next resident of Number 10 than they are on negotiations in Brussels.\n“But equally shameful is the fact Labour are whipping MPs into supporting the hard-line Brexit being pushed by the Tories. The ‘Lexit’ wing of the Labour party is a throwback to the socialism of the 1980s and will do nothing to protect rights or jobs in modern Britain.While Labour are running scared of their pro-Brexit northern voters, the reality is that these are the very people who will lose the most from the economic consequences of a hard Brexit. Rather than representing them, Labour politicians are abandoning them by colluding in the Tories’ bungled Brexit.\n“Those MPs who genuinely want to put their country first must now join forces in a cross-party alliance and work to oppose leaving the Single Market and Customs Union.

The Party has described a deal involving Chinese investment as an outrage. The deal would see the UK government offering to guarantee a level of return to Chinese investors that involves making a guess about the future market price for electricity. Since this is so uncertain, the whole project relies on British taxpayers taking the risk, say the Green Party.\nMolly Scott Cato, Green Party lead candidate in the South West for next year’s European elections, said:\n“The Conservative government’s deal on the Hinkley Point nuclear power station really is a case of heads they win; tails we lose. Potential profits will now be offshored to China while the nuclear pollution will stay in the UK.”\nGreens are now looking to the EU, which they say may yet be able to block the deal. Professor Scott Cato, who is also the Green Party’s national finance speaker, went on to say:\n“Since the deal involves such a large investment of public money it will be investigated under the EU’s state aid rules. Greens will work to expose the economic and environmental risks inherent in the proposal, and we are thankful that EU scrutiny may still avert this socially and environmentally damaging policy dreamed up in Westminster.”\nThe Green Party is the only UK political party to be committed to phasing out nuclear power, following the example of the German Green Party.\nNotes\nMolly Scott Cato is the lead European candidate for the Green Party in the South West.

Bristol has ranked joint 7th on a list of 182 single-tier councils, which the Greens believe is a reason to be proud of this city, and a cause for celebration.\nCllr Katy Grant, Co-Shadow Cabinet member for climate and ecology, said; “In the last few years, we have seen dramatically improved climate action across the city. As the largest group on the council, Greens have consistently pushed for stronger commitments to emissions reduction, carbon accounting and metrics, building climate resilience, and protecting habitat and biodiversity in the city.\n“The council also has a tireless and expert staff team to thank for the realisation of some significant step-changes in the delivery of these commitments.”\nHowever, the Climate Action Scorecard is clear that in a few key areas, under the current Labour administration, Bristol City Council could still do better. Transport, in particular, stands out as an area where much more must be done.\nCllr Carla Denyer, Co-Shadow Cabinet member for climate and ecology, MP candidate for Bristol Central and national co-leader of the Green Party, said: “After May 2024, in the new collaborative committee system, Bristol’s Green Councillor group intend to get working on transport climate action; including implementation of the workplace parking levy, improved routes for walking and cycling, improving Bristol’s public transport network including through bus franchising, safer streets around schools, and much faster rollout of electric car charging points.\n“The scorecards show that Bristol needs to do more on planning and land use too. Greens have been working hard to ensure the new Local Plan contains higher standards for addressing embodied carbon and sustainable energy use in new buildings”.\nBristol’s score on biodiversity is still low. The Greens say that a Green-led 2024 city council will accelerate and enhance commitments made in the Ecological Emergency Action plans, with more of our green space managed for nature. They also believe that the city needs more thoughtful procurement and more robust collaboration on water quality. A Green-led City Council will use its influence with the regional West of England Combined Authority for a swifter shift towards building our local green economy, technical skills, and a frequent, well connected public transport network, the group says.\nCllr Katy Grant continued; “Bristol has a commendable profile as a city with climate ambitions. Alongside council efforts, this is due to the many community groups and local activists fighting hard for change. Now we need to make sure that this is followed up with measurable action in all areas of city life. The 2021 Bristol Citizens’ Assembly results show a broad-based desire for better city-wide policy and budgeting. And a community led Just Transition Declaration that will be voted on at a Council meeting this Tuesday lays out key principles for how we can embed principles of fairness, inclusiveness and solidarity in the city’s transition to Net Zero.”",

The Shale Wealth Fund appears to be a source of bribes to persuade local communities to accept a dangerous and polluting industry which seems to have become the Chancellor’s dirty obsession. If invested instead in renewables we know the South West could become a Western Powerhouse, powered by clean, safe energy owned by local communities across our region.”\nThe Green MEP also criticised the decision to introduce massive cuts to three departments: DEFRA funding will be cut by 15%, DECC by an even larger 22%, and Transport by a massive 37%. D Scott Cato said:\n“These three departments between them have huge responsibility for protecting our environment and reducing our carbon footprint. Yet as David Cameron heads off to Paris for the COP21 climate talks their budgets are being cut to the bone. He should hang his head in shame as he enters the Paris negotiations. The savage cuts mean that public servants will simply be unable to enforce the laws we have to protect our environment or address climate change.

They call for Britain to recognize US standards which are weaker than those adopted by the EU and could result in chlorinated chicken and hormone-reared beef from the US being sold in the UK.\nDr Scott Cato, a member of the European Parliament’s Agriculture Committee, said this confirmed her worst fears for farmers and food producers in the South West:\n“For many rightwing conservatives, Brexit has always been about tearing up high EU standards on food safety, environmental protection and animal welfare, under the guise of freeing the UK from ‘red tape’. Farmers and food producers in the South West will rightly feel deeply concerned about pressure to ditch these higher standards. Any trade agreement with the US which allows for the import of food and drugs produced without these current safeguards will threaten the viability of many small-scale farmers and food producers. They simply could not compete with the mega-farms and giant corporations of the US”\n“Like so many of the promises made by Brexiteers during the referendum campaign it is clear that the promise to protect farmers and high-quality food is being broken in secret talks behind closed doors.

Clifton councillor Jerome Thomas said: “This is a fantastic chance to make a beautiful part of Bristol easier to access for families and for people with impaired mobility”\n“The provision of a wide, durable path along what are quite precarious ‘desire lines’ for much of the year will help young children who are not confident cyclists, as well as allowing wheelchair users to get from the Stoke Road to Sea Walls with ease.”\nVicki Cracknell, the brains behind the Downs annual Cycle Sunday event, has been spearheading the project.

The procurement process now has to be started all over again. Greens feel that there are tough questions that the Mayor needs to answer before it is restarted.\nCouncillor Jerome Thomas said:\n“We must make sure that as well as responding to the current coronavirus crisis, we don’t sleepwalk into the looming climate crisis. At this time of need across our city, it’s more important than ever that every penny the Council spends represents value for money.”\n“Tax-payers have already seen over £30 million lost through Bristol energy under this administration. Work on procurement through City Leap has cost the city a further £4.2 million without yet seeing any tangible benefits. While of course we desperately need clean energy investment, we need to make sure the City Leap approach is going to deliver real infrastructure improvements, not just words and documents. We want to see lessons learnt from the secrecy and lack of responsiveness that contributed to Bristol Energy losing so much money.”\n“This is why I will be asking the Mayor at today’s Cabinet meeting what the £4.2 million already spent on City Leap has achieved for the City, and why he now needs a further £2 million for a fresh procurement effort.”\n“The City Leap procurement is supposed to be providing funding for Bristol’s clean energy sector, not becoming a black hole in the pocket of the tax-payer. It is very easy for the Mayor talk about attracting a billion pounds of energy investment for the city but I think it is reasonable for Bristol’s residents to know if they are likely to see any positive results from this procurement, and when.”\n“We are in unprecedented times, but we believe that in Bristol we have the vision and imagination to create a future where every home is properly insulated and our energy generation is clean and green.

More than half the homes in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed and around 80% of the Gaza strip is under active evacuation orders.

Other employers include local unitary councils, universities, academies, town and parish councils, housing associations and charities. There are over 135,000 members.\nThe APF is part of a wider pool called the ‘Brunel Pension Partnership’, which is one of eight UK Local Government Pension Scheme (LGPS) pools and includes nine other pension funds from Oxfordshire to Cornwall. Brunel collectively manages over 80% of the total assets and investments held by the LGPS pool.\nBath & North East Somerset Council are the administering authority and are legally responsible for the Fund. The council delegates its responsibility for administering the Fund to the Avon Pension Fund Committee, which is its formal decision-making body.\nBristol City Council has one seat on this committee, which is currently held by Green Cllr Fi Hance.\nThe APF invests funds in a passive pool product, which splits money across thousands of companies at a low cost. The product that the APF invests in was chosen on its climate credentials, and includes a few companies in the ‘aerospace and defence’ category.\nAs part of this, £9.7 million, some 0.2% of the total assets under management in the APF are companies that fall into the ‘aerospace and defence’ category. This includes names such as: BAE Holdings, Boeing, General Dynamics, Saab, Safran. All holdings are published online.\nThere are currently no products that are Paris-agreement-aligned and exclude aerospace and defence. To do this would require a new index to be set up at significant upfront cost, and other local authorities that have looked into this have faced significant legal barriers.\n4.

However, local leaders knew that it doesn’t work that way— it is traffic congestion itself that was causing delays, making buses unreliable and unattractive to passengers.\nJames Freeman, the previous CEO of First Bus, in a conversation with local councillor Paula O’Rourke, made it clear: “You remove the traffic congestion, and then we will put on a greater number of more reliable buses.”\nIn the face of a great deal of opposition, remember the coffin procession to signify the death of the high street? We managed to reduce congestion. With fewer cars clogging the roads, buses are now able to run closer to schedule, encouraging more people to use them. This has created a “virtuous circle”— as bus reliability improves, passenger use increases, further easing congestion and allowing for more services to be added. It’s a policy we are trying to replicate in different ways across Bristol.\nPublic transport in Clifton is seeing a major transformation, with new and improved bus services making travel more reliable and convenient. Thanks to efforts to reduce car congestion and prioritise buses across the whole city, First Bus has been able to increase service frequency and introduce new routes to and from Clifton.\nAs a result:\nClifton councillors, Paula O’Rourke and Jerome Thomas have long campaigned for the return of a bus service that allows Clifton residents to access vital services around Clifton Down.\nCllr. Jerome Thomas said, “These improvements have been made possible because more people are choosing to travel by bus, allowing First Bus to expand its services. Now, with a better bus network in place, we hope even more residents will make the switch to public transport”.\nWhat’s more, Victoria Street is now a hub for residents and visitors alike; the newly pedestrianised area is a destination for shopping and socialising – and more people can get there by bus and not worry about where to park!\nCllr. Ed Plowden, Chair of the Transport and Connectivity Committee, said: “We always said that prioritising buses and active travel was the key to better public transport. Now, in Clifton, with fewer cars on the roads, buses are running more reliably, and more people are choosing them. This is exactly the kind of “virtuous circle” of positive change we are trying to achieve.”\nThese changes are part of a broader strategy to create a greener, more accessible city, ensuring that public transport remains a convenient, affordable, and sustainable option for all.\nJerome is a long-term resident with years of experience as a hard-working Clifton councillor.\nMore about Jerome",

I am deeply concerned by the impact that cuts to frontline services will have on those who rely on them. I’m scared by how this will affect our communities and how we work together as a city. I am also sad for the many valuable council staff who, after a lifetime of working to provide services for the people of Bristol, are being told that they no longer have jobs.\nMostly though I am angry that the people we represent are being abandoned because of a political choice in Westminster. Bristolians are being forced to pay more Council Tax for less services, and there’s a simple reason – Government is brutally slashing its grants to local authorities, by 75% by 2020. The Government have chosen a path to intentionally dismantle our public services. They could be closing tax loopholes, reforming our finance system, bringing good growth to our economy or increasing tax for the top 1%. But they are choosing not to, they chose to bail out the banks and spend billions on defence projects like Trident, and pay for it by taking from the most vulnerable. So let’s be clear, the blame for these cuts should fall squarely on the shoulders of this Conservative Government.\nEvery time a library closes, a homeless person no longer has a safe place to sleep or a local bus route vanishes, we must remember that these cuts are not inevitable, they are a choice that our Government has made. They have chosen to take books from our children instead of asking the richest in our country to contribute a fraction more.\nWe must remember this next time we go to the ballot box. We live in a democracy, albeit an imperfect one, and we can and we must demand change. It is not enough to bury our heads in the sand as the services that keep our communities together crumble around us. Until then, if we want change we are going to have to build it ourselves by campaigning for an end to austerity, a proportional voting system where our votes will count and proper investment in our public services.\nOur Mayor, Marvin Rees, says he can still deliver on his commitments despite these cuts. I am doubtful but hope I am proven wrong. At the moment though this promise looks unlikely to be fulfilled. Despite promising to protect children’s services, his latest budget includes £1,500,000 of cuts to ‘re-shape children’s services’.

She said:\n“One of the key reasons Greens have opposed CETA is because of the power this treaty gives to corporations to sue governments over legislation that threatens their profits. If CETA is ratified before the UK exits the EU, we will need to renegotiate our trade agreements with Canada but still be bound by the investor protection provision aspect of this treaty for 20 years. This would mean foreign investors would still have the right to sue the UK government if they feel their businesses have been impacted by new laws or regulations.\n“Signing up to CETA is the worst of all possible worlds for the UK. It will take us back to square one on trade negotiations with Canada but trap us in a most toxic element of this treaty. With Brexit looming it is even more critical that all British MEPs vote this dodgy deal down next week in the European Parliament.”",

The new timescales would see a full outline business plan sent to government at the end of December 2019, a full year after the original deadline for Bristol to produce an air quality plan.\nCllr Eleanor Combley, leader of the Green Councillor Group, said:\n“More evidence of the stark health impacts of air pollution is discovered every few months. Recently it emerged that poor air quality is linked to a greater risk of psychosis in teenagers and last month research suggested that toxic air may be responsible for twice as many deaths as previously thought, making it deadlier than smoking.\n“So it is deeply depressing that in the face of this public health crisis – responsible for an estimated 300 deaths per year in Bristol – Bristol’s Labour administration is going back to the drawing board once again instead of taking the bold action needed to save lives. Under their current plans there’s no chance of any real action being taken until well into 2020. As well as a public health emergency, this is an equalities issue. People in some the poorest parts of the city, in wards like Lawrence Hill, not only suffer the most from air pollution but are also less likely to own cars than wealthier residents.\n“But it doesn’t have to be like this. Cities that have got their act together and produced concrete plans – like Birmingham – have already won tens of millions of pounds from the government to implement clean air zones and reduce the impact on residents through funding for a scrappage scheme and support for taxis. We could have already guaranteed this support in Bristol but instead we have had the astonishing spectacle of a Labour Mayor refusing to take action and even recently blaming doctors and health experts for air pollution rather than facing up to his own responsibilities.\n“Let’s be clear – these further delays are costing lives. The Mayor should release the expensive research the council commissioned into Clean Air options so Bristolians can see on what basis he has refused to act, and how much longer it will take us to bring air quality levels down under his new proposals. Air pollution is a public health crisis and the Mayor needs to face up to his duty to take decisive action.”\nGreen mayoral candidate Sandy Hore-Ruthven said: “By not taking action on air pollution the Mayor is condemning the poorest in the city to suffering most. At the same time he is missing an opportunity to tackle poverty, inequality and air quality. By investing in better buses, cycle and pedestrian routes we could be tackling many of the problems this city faces.

Remember that you don’t have to accept any of the options offered. Instead you can just use the free comment sections of the consultation to describe what you think should happen.\n“If cuts are made to the scheme, this will push people deeper into poverty. It is likely that the Council will end up footing the bill for the knock-on effects – for example, greater demand for family support and homelessness services. So as well as causing a huge amount of pain for the poorest Bristolians, the cuts may generate little or no financial gain. Camden Council recently reinstated its full council tax support largely for this reason.”\nCouncillor Carla Denyer said: “The proposed cuts to Council Tax Reduction Scheme are in my view deeply immoral and would inevitably see visits from bailiffs imposed on the poorest in Bristol. It is estimated that 25,000 households would be affected by the change, and many of these households include children. And let’s not forget that these are the 25,000 very poorest households, already under immense pressure due to cost of living increases and cuts to services. Increasing the tax they are required to pay will almost certainly result in increased homelessness and will see many more households relying on food banks just to get by.

The motion, proposed by Green councillor Fi Hance and seconded by Labour councillor Ruth Pickersgill, calls on Bristol’s Mayor to endorse the ‘These Walls Must Fall’ Campaign (1), lobby the UK government, and work with local MPs and other councils to push for changes in immigration law and alternatives to detention.(2)\nImmigration detention recently hit headlines in Bristol when Kenneth Macharia, a gay rugby player for local team Bristol Bisons, was detained and threatened with deportation. (3) Close to 100,000 people have signed a petition against Kenneth’s deportation to Kenya, where he would be persecuted because of his sexuality. (4)\nCurrently in the UK approximately 30,000 people are detained in immigration detention every year, having committed no criminal offence, but for lacking the correct immigration papers or pending administration of their case. Detention is at centres in prison-like conditions, with no time limit on how long people might be held – detainees do not know whether they will be held for weeks, months or years. The UK is the only country in Europe to detain people indefinitely in this way, at a cost to the government over £100 million per year. (5)\nGreen Councillor Fi Hance said:\n“As a city of sanctuary, Bristol has for many years been vocal in its support of refugees in the city. It is a source of ongoing shame that even today many thousands of people who have committed no crime are detained, often at short notice for many months at a time. This has a huge financial cost but more importantly is a cruel and indefensible way to treat those in our society who have the least. By passing this motion and throwing its weight behind this great campaign, the Council can play an important role in pressuring national government and politicians, and show that Bristol refuses to be a hostile environment for migrants or asylum seekers.”\nDavid Ion from the These Walls Must Fall campaign in Bristol said:\n“These Walls Must Fall Motions have now been passed in cities across the UK: Manchester, Liverpool, Brighton, Oxford and more. When our core cities come together and say no to immigration detention, Westminster will have to listen. Please join us on our march on Dec 8th at 11.30 in Castle Park if you think it’s time that Bristol joins this list and stands up against immigration detention.”\nLabour Councillor Ruth Pickersgill, who worked with Councillor Hance on the motion, said:\n“These Walls Must Fall’ is a really important national campaign that I hope the Council will support. As part of a wider deliberately hostile environment, this Government has allowed a situation to develop where asylum seekers and migrants can be detained for indefinite periods in prison conditions even when they have committed no crimes.\n“Many people in my ward have come to the UK, expecting to be safe and to have their human rights respected, and find themselves whisked away to a Detention Centre, and more often than not, this trauma has a profound impact on their mental health. People seeking sanctuary should not be locked up like criminals.”\nThe motion is a ‘golden’ motion which means it will be the first to be debated at the Council meeting at City Hall (Tuesday 11 December). These Walls Must Fall is planning a march against immigration detention in Bristol on 8 December, starting from Castle Park at 11:30am.

If successful the councillor’s call-in request will mean that the application has to go before a committee where councillors determine the outcome and will have the option to reject the development plans.\nCouncillor Charlie said:\n“I have submitted a call-in for this application for two main reasons. Firstly, it is the focal point of a development which is just too big for the area. It would still be entirely possible to have a major development on Bedminster Green without all these extremely tall buildings. Secondly, it is utterly outrageous that this development has come forward with a proposal for zero affordable housing given the level of housing need in Bristol.\n“I hope that my call-in is successful and the developers are asked to look again at their plans. I supported the initial plans due to the promise of substantial affordable housing and economic benefits to the local area. However these new plans dwarf the original proposals – a much smaller development would still deliver major benefits for local traders, and the complete absence of affordable housing on offer here is frankly not good enough.”\nIn addition to the size of the development and its lack of affordable housing the call-in document (attached here) also cites other issues with the development.

The ODI claims that the UK government subsidised the fossil fuel industry to the tune of £4.3 billion in 2011. This critical report comes at a time when the Coalition government is considering a review of the green levy element of energy bills, which support energy efficiency and renewable power.\nMolly Scott Cato, the Green Party’s Finance Speaker and lead South West candidate for next May’s European Elections said:\n“Subsidising fossil fuels on such a massive scale while seeking to cut investment that helps reduce fuel poverty and supports renewable energy demonstrates the warped priorities of this government. Fossil fuel subsidies severely hinder the development of an efficient and low-carbon economy by distorting the market to this extent and making it harder for renewable energy technologies to compete. At the same time it is fossil fuels, not green levies, which are responsible for high fuel bills. Take dual fuel bills. Between 2004 and 2010 these rose by £455, of which £382 was due to soaring gas prices [2].”\nThe Green Party also point to the fact that promoting the South West of England to become a leader in renewable energy could ultimately reduce fuel bills and create an additional 34,000 jobs in the renewable energy sector [3].\nProfessor Scott Cato concluded:\n“The Green Party’s solution to high energy bills is to reduce demand for energy, particularly by improving the energy-efficiency of our homes, which is precisely the destination of some of the money from green levies. The party also takes inspiration from Germany’s rapid move towards renewable generation, much of which is owned by local communities. This transition towards renewable energy ownership at community level is the best way of escaping the clutches of the fossil fuel energy giants and their ever rising fuel bills.”\nNotes\n[1] ODI: Time to change the game, Executive Summary: http://www.odi.org.uk/sites/odi.org.uk/files/odi-assets/publications-opinion-files/8669.pdf\n[2] Regen SW – Energy bills and green energy, the facts: http://www.regensw.co.uk/news/2013/10/30/energy-bills-and-green-energy-the-facts\n[3] The South West Renewable Energy Manifesto, identifying the potential for the renewable energy sector in the South West: http://regensw.s3.amazonaws.com/manifestoa4_hi_res_05b1225217bcdad0.pdf",

The Green motion called on the Council to lobby its multibillion pound local pension fund (Avon Pension Fund) to move its investments out of fossil fuels. The motion and debate came at the end of a council meeting in which the Council presented a report on tackling the Climate Emergency.\nResponding to Labour’s amendment to the Green Party motion, Cllr Fodor said:\n“Four years ago Bristol Labour amended a motion I brought to the council calling for us to pull pension funds out of fossil fuels and removed the call for divestment. Now, at the very same meeting that the Council heard the administration’s plans for the Climate Emergency, Labour have voted with Conservatives to again block action on divestment, amending the Green motion in order to maintain the Pension Fund’s fossil fuel investments and continue with the discredited approach of ‘engagement’ (or ‘having conversations’ with fossil fuel companies).”\n“The time for dialogue with fossil fuel companies is so clearly over – these are the companies who have lobbied for increased methane pollution, asked for tax breaks, and plan expanded exploration and production. They claim to do one thing, like stick to the Paris climate agreement, but act the opposite way. Divestment is also backed by UNISON, the council’s largest union, who recognise that if we do not act soon there is a real risk that workers’ pensions will be stuck invested in ‘stranded assets’ as the value of fossil fuel investments falls.”\nGreens felt they had no choice but to abstain on their own motion after an amendment by Labour made fundamental changes to it. A statement from Bristol Council’s largest union UNISON had earlier urged councillors to vote for the un-amended Green motion.\nCouncillor Fodor explained:\n“Labour’s amendment removed the ‘Divestment’ from our divestment motion so we cannot vote for the motion as amended – it’s pointless. If Labour and Conservative politicians – including our Mayor – want to talk the talk on the climate emergency then they need to follow through in their actions and not block steps to actually achieve carbon neutrality when it counts.\n“Meanwhile Greens will continue to demand the Mayor listens to what his employees in UNISON want – invest in the future economy, not the past, and safeguard the planet for future generations. The Mayor must use the Council’s influence on the Avon Pension Fund to pull investments out of fossil fuels.”\nNotes\nCllr Martin Fodor is the Chair of the Environment and Sustainability Committee\nMore about Martin",

But a Freedom of Information request has uncovered the news that British Gas rather than Bristol Energy has now been chosen to supply the city council.

Just a few months ago Full Council voted through an updated policy on social value, committing to promote our local economy and environmental sustainability in the Council’s procurement rules. Value for money isn’t just about choosing what is cheapest, it’s also about investing in what is right for our local communities and our city.”\n“The Labour cabinet member for finance has said that the council is obliged to follow a competitive tendering process. This is true, but the council is also obliged to consider the social value of its contracts.

Bristol City Council will debate this on December 8th 2020.\nOnce the true climate impact of planes are taken into account, Bristol Airport’s expansion plans would emit an additional one million tonnes of CO2 equivalents every year. Campaigners have today launched a petition (www.OneMillionTonnes.com) and #OneMillionTonnes campaign to increase the pressure on local leaders to oppose the airport’s plans.\nBristol Airport was previously refused planning permission for expansion by North Somerset Councillors after a huge outcry from across the region, but the Airport has since said it will appeal this decision.\nCouncillor Jerome Thomas who created the petition said:\n“The proposed expansion of Bristol airport is the biggest decision for our climate in the Bristol region. Support for expansion of Bristol Airport is utterly incompatible with meeting our climate commitments and addressing the climate emergency we face.”\n“Leadership should be about doing what’s right – both for the communities of today and the generations yet to come. Our Mayors must make good on their climate promises by publicly opposing airport expansion.”\nBristol City Council were the first local authority to declare a Climate Emergency in 2018, pledging that Bristol would become carbon neutral by 2030. The West of England (WECA) followed suit, declaring a climate emergency last year. Despite these commitments, both Bristol’s Mayor, Marvin Rees and the West of England Metro-Mayor, Tim Bowles have formally supported Bristol Airport’s expansion plans.\nGreen Councillor Carla Denyer, who proposed Bristol’s Climate Emergency motion said:\n“At the moment we should be thinking very carefully about every single tonne of CO2 we emit. Expanding Bristol airport would generate a million tonnes of CO2 equivalent every single year – that’s 50% of Bristol’s current carbon emissions. That’s a million reasons to oppose it.”\nThe petition comes as those campaigning against the airport’s expansion gear up for the second round of resistance against the plans.\nGreen Councillor Stephen Clarke who is a member of Bristol Airport Action Network (BAAN) a network of individuals and organisations which helped to successfully challenge the Airport’s original application said:\n“Local people are overwhelmingly against the Airport’s plans to expand, but they are being ignored. These plans would completely undo all the hard work towards reducing carbon emissions across the region.”\n“Over 20 other local airports across the country also have plans to expand, so Bristol Airport will also be acting as a test case.”\nThe public enquiry into the Airport’s appeal is due to take place in July 2021, just four months before the UK is due to host the next global round of climate negotiations at COP 26.\nGreen Councillor Jerome Thomas, concluded:\n“I’d like to call on everyone who cares about the climate emergency, everyone who cares about future generations and everyone who cares about Bristol and our surrounding region to sign this petition http://www.tiny.cc/OneMillionTonnes and ask our leaders to speak out against expansion of Bristol airport.”\nNotes\nExpansion plans:\nBristol Airport previously applied for planning permission to expand, but the application was turned down by North Somerset Councillors in March 2018 – a decision they are now appealing.\nThe Climate impact:\nThe EU’s aviation regulator confirmed last week that the aviation sector’s impact on the climate is three times bigger than the effect of its carbon dioxide emissions alone:\nThe airport has previously been criticised by climate experts for underestimating the climate impact of airport expansion – estimating this at 154kpta CO2e – six times lower than the 920ktpa CO2e calculated once other factors are taken into account. This figure will rise way over 1 million tonnes, once the new multiplier of 3 confirmed in the new EU research is accounted for (the previous 920ktpa CO2e used a multiplier of 1.9). A multiplier is the additional impact that non-CO2 emissions and contrails have on the climate:",

In his response the Mayor said “the diversion for cyclists, while not optimal, does provide an alternative route.”\nA local resident, who wished to remain anonymous, told local Green Councillor Heather Mack:\n“I am not able to cycle with my two year old daughter as the redirection route is literally not possible. We do not feel safe on Muller Road with the other cars, as there is no space for a bike and we cannot fit around the cycle restrictors on boiling wells lane as the turning circle is restricted by the bike seat on the handlebars. Also the dirt and mushed leaves along with how steep it is means it is not safe with the extra weight on my bike. We used the Concorde Way weekly and are now being forced to drive.”\nDavid Wilcox, Lockleaze councillor and co-shadow cabinet member for Transport and Active Travel, said:\n“Of course Greens support the new train station but the diversion of Concorde Way is not fit for purpose. It brings pedestrians and cyclists into conflict on a shared pavement and through Boiling Wells cyclists must dismount because it’s so steep. If we’re going to reduce traffic and tackle the Climate Emergency, we need to be making it easier, not harder, for people to walk and cycle to work. This diversion – which is expected to be in place until at least November – undermines the Council’s own policy aims and will only encourage more people to drive, causing more pollution and congestion for all of us.”\nThe Green Councillors say Labour’s track record on transport is reflected by a cars-first attitude that “belongs in the 1960s” which has left Bristol falling behind other core cities and led to worsening traffic as the city’s narrow and crowded streets are filled with private cars, and could result in the city getting less funding for transport schemes in the future. The opposition councillors pointed to a long list of issues they say demonstrate this lack of ambition on transport, including failures to improve dangerous cycling infrastructure, removal of bike lanes and failure to maintain them, Labour plans to remove transport design powers, poor parking enforcement and a limited rollout of new cycle hangars (see full list in notes below).\nGroup Leader Emma Edwards, who shares the shadow cabinet role with David, said:\n“The failure to address this dangerous diversion for Concorde is part of a worrying trend we have seen of late, with this Labour Administration not only not improving things for cycling in Bristol, but in many instances actively making things worse. Far too many decisions by Bristol Labour – whether it’s removing cycle lanes, projects that don’t meet official standards (risking future funding), or simply dragging their heels on basics like new bike hangars – seem calculated to show contempt for cycling and walking.\n“The Concorde way diversion is merely the latest in a long list of similar issues that this Labour administration have presided over – just last week they decided to re-open a pedestrianised road to through traffic, ignoring the council’s own policies to put cars before pedestrians and cyclists. And the Mayor’s plans to scrap key transport and city design teams and hand those powers to WECA risks completely taking away our city’s ability to implement its own walking and cycling schemes in the future, which could make matters worse.”\nShe added,\n“Labour’s car-centric approach belongs in the 1960s – it’s getting us nowhere fast. With our buses in a state of near-collapse, and constant steps backwards on active travel, it’s not surprising Bristol is consistently one of the worst UK cities for traffic under this administration. Our city deserves better.”\nList of active travel issues raised by Greens:\nNotes\nCllr Emma Edwards is the Leader of the Green Group on Bristol City Council\nMore about EmmaCllr David Wilcox is the Green Group Whip\nMore about DavidCllr Heather Mack is the Deputy Leader of Bristol City Council\nMore about Heather",

The Greens will not.\nUKIP leader Paul Nuttall will also be interviewed by BBC presenter Andrew Neil in one of a series of programmes throughout the week beginning May 22.

The hashtag was last popular when the Greens were initially excluded from the 2015 televised election debates [3].\nCommenting on the announcement, Molly Scott Cato, who is also standing as the Green Party parliamentary candidate for Bristol West, said:\n“The BBC’s love affair with UKIP is as astounding as it is embarrassing. We expect and deserve so much more from the BBC. UKIP was wiped out in the local elections, they were left with just one seat and looking to be heading to win one fewer than that in the general election yet the BBC, once again, confirms the Party will always have a safe seat in the corporation’s news studios. It is getting beyond a joke.”\n“That the BBC have chosen to broadcast the UKIP programme from Bristol just adds insult to injury. The Greens can win in Bristol. UKIP can’t. In Bristol West, the constituency in which I hope to make history on June 8 by doubling the Green Party’s representation in Parliament, almost 80% of people voted to remain in the European Union.”\n“From speaking to people on the doorstep, I know UKIP’s attempts to win cheap headlines with its migrant blaming, EU-scapegoating, and blatantly Islamophobic policies [4] holds no sway with voters. Bristol is seeking a different kind of politics. With the Green Party, this is possible. We’re bringing new thinking and putting radical voices on the frontline of British politics.

However, the council also has its own 2025 carbon neutral target, and Green Councillors say that even here, it does not clearly set out how the Council will reach its own emissions targets.\nCouncillor Katy Grant, Co-Shadow Cabinet member for Climate and Ecology, produced an analysis of the Climate Action plan. She said:\n“This plan is a welcome, and needed, update on the previous strategy. However, in terms of allowing Bristolians to judge actions and progress in getting us to net zero, it is inadequate. The plans are limited in scope and lacking in key details – action tracking, progress towards targets, the scale of the challenge, and timeframes. Too often, the report refers to an ‘aspiration’ or future commitment instead of noting actual progress towards a target – even where it concerns the council’s own emissions. Frankly the Action Plan does not have nearly enough measurable ‘Action’ to address the Climate Emergency”\nShe added,\n“The climate emergency requires two things: real, practical action, and honesty about how far we have to go. But four years since declaring a climate emergency, there’s been not enough significant changes in the city. The City Leap programme is extremely promising, but there needs to be a greater sense of urgency across all key emissions areas citywide.”\nGreens highlighted a number of issues with the report. They noted that it:\nGreens recognise that some steps have been taken such as support for community energy initiatives, the adoption of a council housing retrofit programme, and development of the City Leap joint venture which should help decarbonise heat networks and add to council house upgrades. But these have barely started.\nWe welcome the city being invited to join the EU 100 Climate neutral cities Mission to share experiences and learn from others.\nWork towards the City’s 2030 carbon neutral target is in theory led by the One City climate strategy.\nHowever this is described by the Council as a “a city-wide, shared vision and not owned by any single organisation”. While the idea of a city-wide collaboration between organisations is essential, the way it is currently structured does not set out specific targets or projects to be carried out by certain partners. This lack of leadership and accountability means that progress has been slow.\nCouncillor Carla Denyer, Co Shadow Cabinet member for Climate and Ecology and Co-Leader of the Green Party England and Wales, explained:\n“Transport is one of our biggest causes of emissions, and an area where the Council can have a real impact, unfortunately it is rather weakly dealt with in the report. For example, public transport is a major key to reducing emissions. WECA controls buses, but Bristol City Council still needs to demonstrate how it is pushing for improvements here to get people out of their cars. There is no mention made of progress installing electric vehicle (EV) charging points – but the city will need many, many more to prepare for a EVs. And walking and cycling is the single most cost-effective way to reduce transport emissions, and can improve public health, wellbeing and the economy – but the report just mentions that “a number of projects” are underway. For years the council has lacked a plan to develop a safe, joined-up cycling network – this must be addressed.”\nShe added,\n“It seems the problem here is the Labour administration is unwilling to consider any changes that take space away from private cars, and has ignored proposals to do so from the Citizens’ Assembly, Greens and local communities. While other UK cities are already introducing low traffic neighbourhoods across wide areas, Bristol is still preparing a single pilot scheme in 2024. But it’s not too late to change course – WECA has millions of pounds to spend on transport and if our city develops a decent cycling strategy we could go for the funding to make it happen.”\nGreens say there are a number of steps they would take to ramp up Bristol’s progress towards climate targets. They have suggested several ideas including:\nGreens also made many recommendations in 2019 for actions that could be started quickly and at relatively low cost – see ‘change starts now’ report.",

We have also long-campaigned for the introduction of smart rent controls and fixed tenancies. The fact that the Conservatives are finally catching up by consulting on abolishing letting agent’s fees is a testament to the strength of the progressive argument for rental reform, and also a vindication of the campaigning of organisations such as Shelter, Crisis, Citizen’s Advice, and, here in Bristol, Acorn. “\n“But a ban on letting agent fees is only a first step for the many Bristolians struggling to pay extortionate rents.

That motion was passed unanimously by all parties.”\n“Although the banning of lettings agents fee is a welcome relief for those tenants who are charged them, private sector rents here in Bristol still remain unaffordable for an increasing proportion of Bristol families.

She said:\n“On the hottest day of the year so far, the government announces both its plans to shelve the Swansea tidal lagoon project and expand Heathrow. The two decisions, coming just hours apart, are a reflection of the utter contempt the government has for future generations facing the prospect of climate breakdown.\n“In rejecting the Swansea tidal lagoon project, Business and Energy Secretary Greg Clark told MPs that no individual project or technology can proceed at any price. Unless of course, it is nuclear or fracking. The £1.3bn price tag for the Swansea tidal lagoon – a pioneering project that would have generated enough electricity for 155,000 homes – is dwarfed by the cost of Hinkley costing at least £30bn and rising.\n“It’s clear that the climate change sceptics and deniers in government are taking back control and Green Brexit will lie buried under the rubble of the hundreds of homes that will be demolished to make way for Heathrow’s third runway.”\nMolly is also highly critical of Labour MPs, 119 of whom defied their Party’s position on a third runway at Heathrow and used a free vote to support the government.

The figure has been described as ‘paltry’ by Greens. They point out that this is likely to fund no more than 70 community schemes across the whole of England between now and 2020; just 10 a year. They contrast this with the fivefold increase in the number of renewable energy co-operatives in Germany between 2007 (101) and 2011 (586) [2].

It’s no such thing of course. Ed Davy and his department would do well to look to our European neighbours in Denmark and Germany who are really empowering people to take control of their energy supply. In both countries communities wanting to generate their own energy have been offered ongoing support in the form of high and guaranteed levels of feed-in tariff.

Green MP Caroline Lucas has introduced a private members bill under the rail network would be brought back into public ownership step by step.\nWhen franchises come up for expiry, or private companies break the terms of their franchise agreements, they would revert to the control of a public body.\nA report published last year by Transport for Quality of Life found that the private sector has not delivered the innovation and investment that it promised, that the costs of back-room staff have massively increased, and that the cost of train travel has risen by 23% since privatisation. It estimated that £1.2bn is being lost each year as a result of fragmentation and privatisation.*\nTony Dyer, Green parliamentary candidate for Bristol South said\n“The East Coast franchise delivered £200m to the public purse last year. We need to get back to the idea that railways are a service to be run for the benefit of people, not simply something to profit a shareholder.’”\nDarren Hall, Green parliamentary candidate for Bristol West\n“We need a new vision and the political will to tackle transport issues head on. Bristol is really lucky to have railway lines criss-crossing the city. The trouble is that some of it is under utilised or in the case of the Portishead line not used for passengers at all, whilst other bits are crammed full to bursting point. However, there is no incentive for the big private companies to bother with local rail, and yet it is a very simple solution to a lot of Bristol’s road congestion and air quality problems. If the rail system was run with customers in mind, with profits being reinvested in the system, Bristol could take a hugely important step towards providing a public transport system that is fit for the future.”\nGreen councillor Charlie Bolton has submitted a motion to Bristol City Council calling on MPs to back the rail bill, although it is unlikely to be taken.\n“The irony is that some of the biggest profiteers are the state-owned rail companies of our European neighbours. Taxpayers’ money that should be reinvested into services is ending up in the hands of overseas shareholders. By taking back individual franchises when they expire, the Government could save over £1 billion a year every year.”\n*Notes to editors\n1) View Lucas’ Private Member’s Bill at http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/2013-2014/0081/14081.pdf.

Cllr Heather Mack, who is the Green nominee for Deputy Leader of the council, previously described this system as a “more democratic process where councillors from all parts of the city – from Filwood to Lawrence Hill, Hengrove to Stoke Bishop – and people from all walks of life and backgrounds can work together to improve Bristol for everyone.”\nFollowing the election where Greens fell two short of a majority with 34 councillors, the role of Mayor has been abolished and major decisions will now be made by eight policy committees.\nThe Greens believe that the chairs of these committees and the councillors that sit on them should be proportionally divided. Labour have refused to confirm whether or not they will take any policy committee chairs, despite being asked earlier this week.\nCllr Emma Edwards, Leader of the Green Group on Bristol City Council said, “The people of Bristol voted for the committee system and the Greens because they saw that political culture in this city needs to change. By starting these discussions, we are trying to work in a collaborative way that the previous Labour Mayor never did.\n“Avoiding meetings with the other parties to talk about this like adults is a dereliction of Labour’s responsibility to the city, and an insult to all those that voted for Labour and a more democratic governance system.\n“If Labour do not take the policy committee chairs that they are entitled to, they will not get extra chairs on any regulatory committees. Ultimately, we want to work together for the good of the city, and we believe that is what the people of Bristol want too. It is disappointing that Labour are not coming to the table to negotiate at this vital time.”\nCllr Emma Edwards is the Leader of the Green Group on Bristol City Council\nMore about Emma",

We are now looking forwards to progressing with further, much-needed and long awaited improvements to the wider site facilities for the benefit of the local and wider community.”\nThis also comes as welcome news for local Green Party councillors for Bishopston and Ashley Down, Emma Edwards and Lily Fitzgibbon, who have been supporting the Ardagh in their plans.\nCouncillor Edwards said of the decision:\n“The Ardagh is a much-loved and valued community space, and the trustees and volunteers work incredibly hard to keep it running – so I am so pleased that this community asset transfer is going ahead. It’s something that Cllr Lily Fitzgibbon, myself and previous local Green councillors have been helping the Ardagh work towards for many years. This measure will give the community trust more scope to develop and grow the space, while still allowing for the bowling club to carry on, a concern that some members have had.

  "https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_/https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_a-christmas-message-from-molly-scott-cato-mep/content_368.html": "menu\nA Christmas message from Bristol’s Green MEP, Molly Scott Cato, on where we are on Brexit and how, as we head into 2019, a People’s Vote offers a way out of our political crisis.\nWe end the year in a completely different place to where we started it. At the beginning of 2018, a People’s Vote was little more than an idea; now it seems like the only realistic way out of the impasse. Again, at the beginning of the year, the Tories were deeply divided over Brexit; a party at war with itself and lacking trust in its leader. But now… oh well, some things never change!\nIndeed, so bitter has the infighting become, that the Brextremists plotted a coup. But the failed attempt to ditch Theresa May, looks like the final desperate throw of the dice by those who want to throw the country off the hard Brexit cliff face. This was really a vote of no confidence in a failed project, based on lies and won by cheating.\nNot only has Theresa May shown contempt for parliament by cancelling the meaningful vote on her deal, she has, as expected, failed to persuade European leaders to renegotiate the deal. Her theatrics are little more than a delaying tactic, with the vote on the deal now kicked down the road to mid-January. When we all know it will fail to gain enough support to pass.\nWhich leaves us in stalemate. The Brextremists’ dangerous fantasy Brexit is dead; Theresa May’s deal won’t get enough support and No Deal is simply not an option.\nAs to Labour’s alternative of a general election and reopening negotiations, this is self-serving pie in the sky. Nine in ten Labour members support the idea of a People’s Vote, but the Labour leadership’s strategy is effectively blocking this.\nCorbyn’s failure to table a vote of no confidence in the government – opting instead for his own delay theatrics of a vote of confidence in Theresa May – is obstructing the route to a People’s Vote. Labour would inevitably lose this vote but that would then open up the only realistic alternative – handing the decision back to the people.\nGreens were the first Party to call for a public vote at the end of the Brexit negotiations. Right the way through 2017 we called for a vote on the final deal, or ‘ratification referendum’. This year the People’s Vote campaign took up the baton and ran with it.\nBy October, the idea was so popular it drew 700,000 people to the streets of London, in the biggest demo in the capital since the Iraq war. The idea has now established strong cross-party support, including from many Labour MPs and a growing number of Tory MPs. It has the full backing of Greens, Lib Dems, the SNP and Plaid Cymru.\nA People’s Vote offers the easiest, fastest and fairest way out of this shambles. This time the referendum will be based on the facts and the reality of Brexit: a clear choice between the prime minister’s deal – the only deal on offer – or remaining in the EU.\nI have been immensely proud of the way Green MP Caroline Lucas has become the figurehead for the People’s Vote, with the campaign choosing her to champion the idea on TV debates and panel shows. There has been an avalanche of positive comments about these appearances. It has been said that she is the only adult in the room in such debates.\nThe momentum now seems unstoppable. We can exit from Brexit in 2019. We can achieve the best possible deal with the EU – which is our current deal as fully-fledged members. The EU have repeatedly said the door remains open if we want to change our minds.\nSo I believe we can look forward to the New Year with great hope. We can put this disastrous chapter in our country’s history behind us by giving control back to the people. I have every confidence – given the facts and the reality of what Brexit actually means – that people will choose to remain in the EU.“\nMolly Scott CatoFind out more about her work at www.mollymep.org.uk",

A Supreme Court ruling in 2014 found that Haringey Council’s consultation on council tax reduction was illegal for this reason (Supreme court decision here). Several other councils have also fallen foul of the law with their consultations, including Solihull, who ended up having to re-run their consultation.\nGreen Councillors also condemned the unfairness of the options in the consultation proposed, which by their nature would result in a huge tax rise for the poorest in the city.\nCouncillor Carla Denyer said: “The proposed cuts to Council Tax Reduction Scheme are in my view deeply immoral and would inevitably see visits from bailiffs imposed on the poorest in Bristol, as those already under immense pressure due to cost of living increases are simply unable to pay. They are likely to result in increased homelessness and see many more households relying on food banks just to get by. The likelihood that the consultation on these changes may be illegal makes our case even stronger – at the very least the Mayor must re-draw the consultation to give Bristolians a real choice and allow them to protect the poorest in the city from these cruel cuts.”\nLeader of the Green Group, Councillor Eleanor Combley, pointed out that as well as hitting the most vulnerable hardest, the proposed cuts would save a relatively small sum of money. She said:\n“The Council’s guide to the consultation presented ‘net’ savings which didn’t take into account increased costs from administration or enforcement, or provide any estimate of the increased costs to other council services which would be a likely knock-on effect of the cuts – for example, greater pressure on mental health services and increased homelessness. So as well as causing a huge amount of pain for the poorest Bristolians the cuts could generate very little financial gain. Camden Council recently reinstated its full council tax support largely for this reason. We’re calling on the mayor to look into the legality of the consultation as a matter of urgency. We would prefer it is scrapped altogether but if the Mayor insists on running a consultation it must be run it with a no-cuts option to maintain council tax support for the poorest in Bristol.”\nContact\nCouncillor Eleanor Combley\nCllr.eleanor.combley@bristol.org.uk\nBackground info\nCamden Councillor Sian Berry campaigning for council tax amnesty and for the 100% relief: https://camden.greenparty.org.uk/news/2016/10/24/green-party-calls-for-council-tax-amnesty/\nOfficial PR from Camden council: http://news.camden.gov.uk/camden-exempts-12000-lowest-income-households-from-council-tax/\nComment from a London-based poverty action group: http://z2k.org/2016/07/camden-council-proposed-introduction-of-100-council-tax-support/",

Public health and transport are intrinsically linked, and we have to address the air pollution that is shortening our lives and leading to premature deaths.”\nCouncillor Tom Leimdorfer, Leader of the Green/Independent Group on North Somerset Council said:\n“Housing development in rural areas is not sustainable without much improved and affordable public transport options. The volume of traffic and the impact of heavy goods vehicles are already causing severe safety and pollution problems in our villages.”\nJonathan Carr, Green councillor for Abbey Ward on Bath & North East Somerset Council said:\n“Cycling and walking routes and public transport provision in the West of England are shockingly poor and must be the focus of future transport strategies. With such inadequate provision for non-drivers many residents unable to drive through poverty or ill health are isolated and unable to access even basic amenities.

There is no doubt that freedom of movement within the EU benefits economies. This nasty, stigmatising rhetoric, which seeks to blame people from Eastern Europe for low wages, for housing shortages, for crowded public facilities, is not only incorrect, but has serious consequences for business,” said Ms Keller.\nSka Keller will further offer her support to South West European lead candidate, Molly Scott Cato, who is an economist vocal in her support of the benefits of the European single market.\n“Contrary to what UKIP would have voters believe, migrant labour is not causing the low wages and lack of employment that face our country – government policy is. We need strong political representatives willing to stand up for a living wage, for an end to zero hours contracts, for green jobs and a revolution in our financial policy,” said Molly Scott Cato.\n“Electing more Green councillors and MEPs is the best way to ensure a fair society that values people and their rights, regardless of nationality.”\nSka Keller is also an expert in migration issues and asylum rights. On this she said:\n“Bristol’s move to become a City of Sanctuary sends a positive message of welcome which I wholly support. We should give meaningful protection for people who seek asylum and open ways for legal immigration. Instead of fighting refugees, we should fight the reasons for which people have to flee, such as conflicts, poverty and climate change.”\nDr. Molly Scott Cato, tipped to become the South West’s first Green MEP, will welcome Ska Keller to the city on her visit. The visit will include meetings with business leaders and projects across the city which demonstrate the benefits that EU and non-EU migrants bring to trade in the city, as well as the challenges that they face.\nStops on the visit will include: Stapleton road shops and business owners, a meeting with representatives from City of Sanctuary and Bristol Refugee Rights, initiatives to regenerate local shopping areas by supporting trader development, and a meeting with the Chair of the European Green Capital 2015 at the Centre for Sustainable Energy.\nKeller will also meet with local Green Party candidates aiming to join existing Green councillors in City Hall.

It is through championing our ratification referendum and campaigning to remain in the EU in such a referendum that the people will bring an end to this damaging and dangerous chapter in our county’s history. I believe as Greens we must add our voices to the growing chorus demanding that we can – and we must – Stop Brexit!”\nMolly said a ratification referendum will offer ‘more not less democracy’:\n“There is nothing undemocratic about this. We are asking for more democracy, not less. We are asking for a democratic choice between two real, possible futures at the end of the Brexit negotiations: the deal, or remaining a member of the EU.”\nShe also made a blistering attack on the Conservatives over their record on Brexit:\n“The Conservative Party are disfiguring our country beyond recognition. They have proved themselves to be incapable of governing and their petty squabbles are destructive at home and embarrassing abroad.\n“It is the Brextremists, fighting tooth and nail against the ratification referendum, who are the anti-democrats. They are terrified that the British people will next time round be armed with the facts and have a much clearer idea of two alternative futures.”\nShe accused Labour of failing to show opposition ‘on the dominant political issue of the day’:\n“Labour cannot claim to be a government in waiting when they won’t even provide opposition on the dominant political issue of the day. They have failed to grasp that the economic damage that Brexit will do will make all the dreams of a better future for Britain and for Britain’s working people turn to dust. There is one simple message for Labour on Brexit: you can’t be anti-austerity and pro-Brexit.”\nMolly was also keen to say how Greens are distinctive from the LibDems on the EU:\n“We will never shy away from being critical of the free market corporate agenda that drives much of EU policy. Greens in Europe are fighting every day for social, economic and environmental justice. We have always believed that the EU must be reformed and that another Europe is possible. It is this which makes us so distinctive from the Liberals in Europe.”",

Extension work could be carried out in ‘void’ periods where housing is empty before being re-let, and be paid for by using underspent money from elsewhere in department budgets.\nExplaining his amendment, Councillor Fodor said:\n“Each year hundreds of Bristol Council houses are returned and re-let to our long waiting lists. We have a broad mix of housing types and this amendment would build an extra room into some suitable houses so the Council’s particularly long waiting times for badly needed larger homes can be brought down just a little. We would use underspent money to pilot the conversion and extension of 10 returned properties in the coming year.\n“This isn’t a new idea, in fact it’s been trialled before and the housing department has said it added very welcome larger homes to the Council’s housing stock. Re-allocating some of the department’s current underspend to carry out more conversion works would help some households in overcrowded, expensive, temporary accommodation. Due to the scale of our housing crisis and long waiting lists, larger families can wait 100s of days for an available property as things stand. This is especially the case in inner City areas such as Ashley, Lawrence Hill and Cabot Wards. I’m glad to move an amendment that would shorten that time just a bit, by expanding the stock of larger homes available.”\nEqualities comments on the amendment by council officers noted that the amendment could be beneficial in areas like Central Bristol, Whitchurch Park and Hartcliffe due to levels of over–crowding and homelessness, as well as Ashley, Lawrence Hill and Cabot wards where residents often have larger families.\nCouncillor Clive Stevens proposed an amendment that would increase funding for housing for adults with disabilities. Buying houses or flats and converting them would allow more adults with disabilities to live independently where appropriate, improving quality of care. By housing more people with care needs independently rather than in residential housing, the amendment would reduce care costs for the council, saving approximately £350,000 per year once completed.\nCouncillor Stevens said:\n“Anyone in business knows that one of the routes to cost savings is to make appropriate investments. It seems the Council is now realising that investing to save – something the Greens have been championing for a while – is key to delivering better value for money from Council tax and Business Rates.”\n“Labour had set aside £4m for this measure and Greens propose increasing it to £6m. This amendment will improve care outcomes, enabling more adults with disabilities to live independently in a home of their own. As well as providing them better care, it will save the Council (and consequently the council tax payer) hundreds of thousands of pounds each and every year.”\nLeader of the Green Group councillor Eleanor Combley said:\n“Together these two amendments would make more social housing available, improve care for adults with disabilities, and save the council hundreds of thousands of pounds per year to boot. I proposed a similar ‘invest to save’ amendment last year and as a result Bristol now has more housing for children in care.\n“Rather than damaging cuts, Green councillors are showing how Bristol Council can invest to save money and improve services. It’s a win win – but of course it has to get approved in tomorrow’s meeting. I hope the majority Labour group votes for it.”\nNotes",

Responding, Molly, who is Green Party speaker on Brexit, said:\n“To conceal studies under the guise that it weakens the government’s negotiating position can mean only one thing: that the studies reveal Brexit will have a negative impact on the UK. If the findings were in any way positive and backed-up their hard Brexit folly, or strengthened their negotiating hand, you can bet they would have been released long ago. The government is running scared. It knows that the impacts of Brexit will be disastrous for our economy.”\nMr Baker acknowledged that the government has conducted an analysis of over 50 sectors of the economy, and for the first time, stated that these studies include financial services, agriculture, energy, retail, infrastructure, and transport.\nThe government has repeatedly been asked to list the sectors it has analysed. In June, in answer to a parliamentary question, the government said it would publish the list ‘shortly’, but to date, no such list has been made available.\nGreen MP, Caroline Lucas, also asked a parliamentary question on whether the impact studies have reached a different conclusion on the UK’s membership of the single market to studies carried out by the government in 2013. The studies, known as the Balance of Competences, concluded that membership of the single market resulted in the GDP of both the EU and UK being ‘appreciably greater than they otherwise would be’ and that ‘integration has brought… appreciable economic benefits.’ The government refused to answer, again arguing that to publish anything would undermine the UK’s ability to negotiate the best deal for the UK. Molly concluded:\n“This is a government in total chaos, riven with internal conflict and division and choosing to feed people fanciful nonsense about life outside the EU rather than reveal the truth about its reckless Brexit escapade. Communities, businesses, and public services need confidence in our long-term planning and this can only be achieved through open, transparent decision-making. The government should come clean and let everyone see exactly what the likely impacts of Brexit on our economy will be.”\nMolly is currently awaiting a response to a freedom of information request for further details of a leaked study into the impacts of Brexit on the NHS. The study, undertaken by the Department of Health, suggests Brexit could result in a shortage of more than 40,000 nurses by 2026.

  "https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_/https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_news_devolution/content_779.html": "menu\nStatement to Cabinet and Full Council – Weds 29th June 2016\nAs Green councillors, we welcome aspects of the devolution deal, but also have significant concerns about aspects of it.\nWe welcome the principle of taking powers away from central government and devolving them to a more appropriate level. We therefore applaud the devolving of transport, adult education, skills and planning powers.\nWe specifically welcome the devolution of transport powers. We have recognised for many years that for transport to progress, we need regional coordination and secure funding.\nWe welcome receiving the £30m per annum for 30 years\nThe core aim of the deal is defined as promoting economic growth. It is vital that promotion of equality and environmental protection are given the same priority as growth. As such, we welcome reference to promotion of equality and environmental protection in the documentation. However, assuming the deal is accepted, equality and climate change indicators must be key elements in the economic model that will be commissioned to define which projects get funding and used to measure success.\nWe have deep concerns about the way in which the devolution deal centralises power into the hands of the Metro-Mayor, and the three local authority leaders. In fact, the structure – apart from scrutiny, and as with the WoE partnership – specifically excludes opposition. We call on the Mayor of Bristol to work with other authorities to address this issue. We also call for the Metro-Mayor to be elected using proportional representation.\nStrong and effective scrutiny at combined authority level is vital for accountability. We need to be assured that scrutiny will be properly funded, and independent. We need the devolution scheme to demonstrate how this will be achieved.\nWe have concerns about how little councillors and local communities have been involved in developing the devolution deal and the rushed pace at which it has been developed. Councillors have not had the opportunity to input into the deal in a meaningful way. Final information on the deal has only been presented a few days before the decision has had to be made and there has been very limited scope for meaningfully suggesting changes or improvements.\nThe public consultation process will not be long enough to enable the public to input meaningfully, and there does not seem to be provision for the outcome of the consultation to change the details in the deal. The deal has been presented throughout as ‘take it or leave it’ which has limited the many ways in which it could have been improved and built upon.\nWe are concerned at the level of influence the LEP will have. We understand that the LEP will need to approve any rise in business rates. While we recognise that business could have a role to play in regional governance, we do not see why this should take precedence over others such as equality groups, the environmental sector, the voluntary sector and unions.\nIn addition to the above, although we are told that powers will not be delegated upwards without the constituent authorities’ consent, we are concerned that this only requires consent from the three Council leaders and not Full Council. We fear that over time powers will pass upwards without Full Council approval, and we strongly suspect that the budgets passed down will include cuts. At worst, we think it possible that this is the beginning of the end of the three local authorities who participate.\nThis is a far from perfect deal, but a strong commitment to equality and environmental protection, combined with a meaningful consultation process will make it more palatable to ourselves, and, we believe residents of the areas concerned.",

This is an emergency and it’s not enough to talk about the climate – we have to do something about it.\n“Greens are clear that ‘business as usual’ just doesn’t cut it. Declaring an emergency means acting like it and we need nothing less than a radical rethink of the way our society and economy works. We have to stop putting profit before people and planet now – before it’s too late.”\nFull statement below:\nStatement from Councillor Eleanor Combley, leader of the Green Group at Bristol City Council\nI welcome the report of the CCC, which lays out a clearly achievable pathway to Net Zero Carbon for the UK as a whole by 2050. It also clearly states that current policy will fail to achieve this, and is not even good enough to reach existing targets – the Tories are already missing their deadlines on carbon emissions. While the government are starting to talk a good game on Climate Change, their lack of action speaks louder than words. Influenced by fossil fuel lobbyists they have expanded fracking and decimated the UK’s renewables industry by slashing subsidies.\nLabour too are scrambling to talk the talk on the environment, yet in recent months they have backed airport expansion, supported new coal mines, and pledged to maintain subsidies to Scotland’s fossil fuel industries. Here in Bristol the Mayor and Labour councillors supported a Green party motion to call a climate emergency – but continue to support the expansion of Bristol airport and an extra 23,000 flights per year.\nThe CCC report states that the costs of taking action are manageable (less than 2% of GDP) and that there are clear benefits to us all – improved health, reduced air and noise pollution, better quality of life, development of new green sectors and jobs. In short, the government has no excuse not to accept the findings and recommendations of the report, and to act on them immediately.\nThe 2050 target should please Labour, who already have it as policy, but it is not sufficient. A more demanding target, like the 2030 Carbon Neutral target proposed by Green Councillors here in Bristol, is needed. The benefits of a green revolution in low carbon products and services will go to the countries that lead the way, not to those who lag behind. The later we leave it to take action, the more abrupt the changes that will be needed, and the greater the cost and disruption that will result. The sooner we take action the sooner we will see the benefits. And as the first industrial country, we have a special responsibility to deal with the consequences of industrialisation, and to lead the way on the solutions.\nGreens have been clear that this is an emergency. And to respond to an emergency, it’s not enough to talk about the climate – you have to do something about it. We’re clear that the ‘business as usual’ called for by Sadiq Khan after a week of XR rebellion in London, simply doesn’t cut it. Declaring an emergency means acting like it – we need nothing less than a radical rethink of the way our society and economy works. We have to stop putting profit before people and planet now – before it’s too late.\nEleanor Combley\nCouncillor, Bishopston and Ashley Down\nLeader, Green Group, Bristol City Council",

Councillor Denyer is a Mechanical Engineer specialising in renewable energy, and received the award in recognition of her leading work on tackling climate change in Bristol, as she led Bristol in becoming the first city in Europe to declare a Climate Emergency. Before going into politics she worked assessing the potential energy generation for new wind farms and became an ambassador for the technology by developing a Wind Farm Game for school children to explain wind engineering through play.\nCouncillor Denyer was nominated by Nicola Grahamslaw, a Bristol-based engineer who works at the SS Great Britain and is herself a previous WE50 winner.\nNicola Grahamslaw said:\n“Since being elected Councillor Denyer has put her background in renewable engineering to good use through working for decarbonisation in Bristol and beyond.

I consider this a great strength.\n“I can’t wait to (virtually) meet and learn more about the other 49 award winners, all of whom are leaders in sustainability.”\nElizabeth Donnelly, Chief Executive Officer of the Women’s Engineering Society explained why WES had chosen the theme of sustainability for 2020:\n“The 2019 Climate Emergency Declarations followed unprecedented weather conditions across the planet. Engineers were instrumental in repairing the Toddbrook Dam after it collapsed in August last year, and it will be engineers who will provide many of the solutions needed to address the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals. We felt that it was the right time to showcase the amazing women who are already working on these issues.”",

The agreement creates a publically sponsored label of “simple, transparent securitisation” to promote confidence in these complex and potentially dangerous products. It also lowers the cost for financial institutions that invest in them.\nGreens/EFA MEP, Molly Scott-Cato, who negotiated for the group, comments:\n“We deeply regret this latest example of political amnesia and regulatory rollback. This legislation will certainly benefit banks and other finance firms but it will not benefit the real economy or ordinary citizens. There is also a risk that the weakness of controls on securitisation may increase the uncontrolled spread of poorly understood risks throughout the financial system.\n“Throughout the negotiations, we attempted to limit the damage by proposing that banks share much more of the risk of the loans that they sell off (increasing their ‘skin in the game’ to ensure they don’t engage in dumping of bad risks), that banks are discouraged from investing in each other’s securitisations, that the products are far less complex and that investors are given the highest quality of information about what is actually in the box.\n“Despite initially strong support from the S&D rapporteur for our amendments, the right wing of the Parliament ensured that, rather than strengthening safeguards against a repetition of past problems, instead, the already unsatisfactory proposal from the Commission was watered down in favour of banks and other lenders of specific kinds of loans and other intermediaries.”",

I’m sure the same decision would not have been made in wealthier parts of the city, which are generally deemed “more sensitive areas” in planning speak. The problem with the planning approach is that it generally protects the wealthy, pretty areas of the city more than anywhere else.”\nGreen councillor for Easton, Anna McMullen said:\n“Visual pollution and the encroaching commercialisation of public spaces that are used by children is something I care deeply about. Evidence strongly suggests that young children (who sit in traffic jams on the M32 and will be impacted by these adverts) are unable to differentiate between advertising and educational fact until the age of eight. In order to protect our young people, we should oppose visual pollution where possible.”\nCouncillor Hoyt continued:\n“Progressive cities around the world have put an end to street advertising.

Based on what he continues to say, Greens and others, including many people in the Mayor’s own party remain concerned that Marvin is not acting in the best interests of the city.\nThese are the responses of Bristol’s Green councillors to the issues that Marvin raises.\nMarvin says:\n1. “The proposed Temple Island arena is the most expensive build in the UK and all the money has to be borrowed, creating substantial public debt for the city.”\nWe respond that the Mayor’s own Value for Money study showed that the arena will pay for itself, will add no burden to the public purse, will not impact on council services and will leave the city with a significant asset. The Mayor has acknowledged on a number of occasions, and most recently on BBC Points West last Thursday, that an arena at Temple Island would be affordable for the city.\n2. “The proposed Temple Island arena design is potentially not fit for purpose because…it is considered too small for world-class acts.”\nWe recognise that stadium fillers like Beyoncé will generally play UK stadiums not arenas. A Bristol arena with a capacity of 12,000 would host the same high quality performers as arenas in other UK cities. In his 2017 tour, among other arenas, Bruno Mars played Liverpool (11,000 audience capacity), Leeds (13,500) and Nottingham (10,000). Katy Perry’s recent UK tour included Newcastle (11,000), Liverpool (11,000) and Glasgow (13,000). Whether you like these singers or not, these are global acts and they’re representative of top billing arena acts across the UK. Take That are planning a 2019 UK tour. They told the Chris Evans Radio 2 Breakfast show that their concerts work better in smaller venues and this could rule out larger arenas. Live Nation who run a number of UK arenas and who have bid to be the Arena operator at Temple Island have said that a venue for 12,000 is a sweet spot for audience size. Because a smaller arena will be fuller for more of the events, this will result in a better atmosphere than in a larger venue which might often be less than half full.\n3. “An alternative mixed use development including a conference centre on Temple Island would offer up to three times as many jobs and over twice the economic return for the city.”\nMy recent article shows how these numbers, which are being presented as facts, have actually been put together by the Mayor’s own members of staff, without any fact checking or verification. Bristol Green Party deputy co-ordinator Sandy Hore-Ruthven has also correctly pointed out, that there are plenty of sites around the city suitable for these kinds of mixed use development, so by putting these mixed use developments elsewhere, Bristol can have an arena on Temple Island and the economic benefit of mixed use development.\nThere has been recent speculation from a ‘council source’ in Bristol Live that the city’s current wholesale fruit and vegetable market in Saint Philips could be an alternative site for an arena. This speculation is interesting, but according to the Fruit and Vegetable Market’s own communications with the Council it would be at least ten years before the site became available. This speculation also raises the question of why this site wouldn’t be suitable for the Mayor’s favoured conference centre and hotel scheme.\nWe continue to believe, using the Mayor’s own words, “when looked at in the round, and with open eyes to any risks,” that building the arena on Temple Island remains the right and best decision for the city. This is the decision we still hope that he takes on September 4th.”",

She has urged them to back a People’s Vote instead – effectively handing the decision on the country’s future back to voters.\nMolly said:\n“Theresa May’s deal is a blind Brexit. The 585 pages of the Withdrawal Agreement are only about the exit arrangements and the nature of the two year transition period. Our long-term future, on the other hand, is outlined in just 26 pages, in the Political Declaration, which is highly vague and none of it legally binding. This slim document poses more questions than it does provide answers. What, for example, will happen to the South West’s fisheries? This is not clear but certainly, the idea of the UK regaining control of our waters post-Brexit has sunk without trace.\n“Neither is there any prospect of renegotiation, a myth being peddled by both extreme Tory Brexiteers and many Labour MPs. The EU have made quite clear that after two years of negotiations, this is it; they will not extend the two-year Article 50 period just because we have made a mess of Brexit and fancy another go.”\nIn her letter to MPs Molly Scott Cato points to recent polls which show the South West region has seen a large swing from Leave to Remain; many areas where a majority voted to exit the EU are now polling majority support for remaining a member. She urges the region’s MPs to support a Peoples Vote as the way to ‘extricate ourselves, in the most democratic way possible, from an impending national disaster.’ She says such a referendum must include a remain option due to the strong shift in public opinion in favour of remaining in the EU.\nMolly concluded:\n“If Brexit was about power and sovereignty, then we can be sure that the prime minister’s deal leaves us diminished: we would become rule takers rather than rule makers. Far from the cake-and-eat fantasies of Brexiters, we will be left to gather up the crumbs from under the EU table.\n“I am looking to the 55 MPs in South West England to do their patriotic duty and vote down this terrible deal and to have the honesty and consistency to trust the people to make the final decision.”",

They have said they are disappointed that WECAs cycling and infrastructure plan “lacks urgency and ambition”.\nCouncillor Martin Fodor said:\n“WECAs cycling and walking plan is a missed opportunity that lacks urgency or ambition. Yes the plans are a step in the right direction, but they are woefully inadequate considering the scale of the emergency we face. Some of the changes will not be in place for another sixteen years – by that time today’s five year olds will be twenty one. They will have grown up without the infrastructure so desperately needed to move people out of cars and into active travel.”\n“The most recent reports to Bristol City Council notes that transport contributes 539kt CO2e annually to Bristol’s carbon emissions. However, this figure has decreased over the lockdown period. If we want to maintain these lower levels of CO2, then WECA’s changes to cycling and walking infrastructure needs a serious boost, and as I said to them in a statement in March they need to redirect the massive roadbuilding budget that will take us further in the wrong direction.”\nCouncillor Jerome Thomas said:\n“Lockdown has seen fewer cars on the streets and more people than ever get on their bikes for the first time or start walking. This is a window of opportunity to help make our roads safer and more inviting to walkers and cyclists. I am disappointed that action hasn’t been taken with greater urgency and urge WECA to show more ambition – they should walk the walk, not just talk the talk.”\n“We need a city and region where there are safe and integrated cycling and walking routes. Where people feel comfortable walking to work and teaching their kids how to ride a bike. We must prioritise space on roads for cyclists and pedestrians over space for cars, in order that people feel more confident walking and cycling.”\n“Shifting away from car use is crucial if we are to address the climate emergency we face, but to do so we need those in power to show real leadership and action not just words.”",

It does not go into further detail on the other groups.\n– Tall buildings may be more expensive to build, which developers may use to offer less affordable housing than alternatives.\n– They often have a worse environmental impact due to a high carbon footprint of construction and less opportunity for on-site renewable energy.\n– Developers of tall buildings are invariably larger corporate developers rather than local businesses employing local people, trades, and supply chains.\n– Tall buildings often impact on the microclimate of surrounding areas and require empty spaces surrounding them which then cannot be used for other developments.\n– Without proper planning there are often issues such as poor control of waste and recycling and not enough space for car parking or bikes.\n– Tall buildings are not necessarily required to house more people – higher density housing can be achieved by designing better neighbourhoods rather than ‘building up’ (As concluded by a UK Govt report)\nCllr Fodor said: “Studies have shown that housing more people doesn’t necessarily require high rises, just better designed neighbourhoods. Cities like Paris lack the skyscrapers of London but house far more people per square kilometre, all in buildings four or six stories tall.

In 2015 the Full Council resolved that the Avon Pension Fund (APF) should consider divestment from fossil fuels and diversification into clean technologies like renewable energy, energy efficiency and energy storage;\n2. Council agreed that the Mayor should contact Avon Pension Fund and ask for a report on the issue;\n3. There is widespread concern from scientists that declared worldwide fossil fuel reserves, if exploited, constitute a threat to the stability of the global climate;\n4. There is growing recognition that fossil fuel reserves are therefore a class of asset held by investors which have growing risks of being ‘stranded’ ie left with reducing value due to the fact not all claimed reserves now have the value being imputed to them, due to the need for them to remain in the ground;\n5. An ever growing number of public and private sector funds, endowments and investment portfolios are choosing to divest from fossil fuels worldwide, including several local government pension funds. MPs have now called for their own funds to be divested.\n6. The recent clarifications of the fiduciary duty of fund managers confirms that they should take into account a range of environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues and have a clear statement of investment policies;\n7. The Avon Pension Fund now uses investment provided by the Brunel Pensions Partnership, which is a leading local government pension partnership offering low carbon investment opportunities.\n8. Staff union Bristol Unison recently reaffirmed their clear support for divestment of the funds from fossil fuels, in a motion seconded by the Branch Secretary.\nThis council believes\n9. The long term future of the APF is as a fund that is divested from fossil fuels and one that ensures a wide range of investments in renewable energy, energy efficiency technologies, energy storage and smart energy technologies, and other types of investments that will benefit the city and its future residents;\n10. Council recognises that a carbon neutral city will create substantial, valuable new jobs in the future sustainable economy.\n11. That the investment strategy and policies of the APF should be brought into line with this vision of the future inclusive prosperity and sustainability of the city;\n12. The APF should be leading this process of divestment and diversification, not waiting until the likelihood of stranded assets become more of a risk to the wealth of the fund;\n13. The process of divestment and diversification is also important and should be managed in a way that ensures just transition to new employment, supporting skills development for new sectors and a range of opportunities – with backing from WECA.\nThis council therefore resolves to call on the Mayor\n14. To meet with the head of the Avon Pension Fund to discuss the divestment of funds over the next 5 years and the review of the fund’s ESG policies\n15. To promote the diversification of the fund into clean technologies that support renewable energy, energy efficiency and energy storage among other investments that are in line with such policies and the city’s goals for 2030;\n16. To liaise with fund members in the city and council unions to explain how this secures future prosperity and pensions income while ensuring a just transition for workers in sectors that will change, and helps achieve a carbon neutral city by 2030.\nMartin Fodor\nRedland Ward Green party Councillor",

The latest negative assessment of Hinkley follows news in September that the drop in costs of off-shore wind power has made it much cheaper than nuclear.\nHinkley is expected to cost billpayers £30bn over the 35-year contract, adding £10-£15 to the average household energy bill.

In the EU the Lib Dems sit in a group clearly attached to free-market policies and are keen proponents of a secret trade deal currently taking place between the EU and US. This deal threatens the high standards of environmental protection and animal welfare that Greens in Europe have long fought for. In the UK we have seen them side with the Tories in supporting tuition fees, benefit cuts, nuclear power and fracking. No wonder young people in particular are turning to the Greens.”\nThe Youth manifesto, launched today by the Green Party’s candidate for European Commission president and Green German MEP, Ska Keller, includes pledges to abolish tuition fees, create well paid jobs for young people and make the minimum wage a living wage. [2]\nFounder and Chair of Plymouth University Young Greens, Thomas Pashby, said:\n“The Green Party is growing in popularity as shown in the opinion polls, especially among young people. This sends a clear message to the Government that young people are feeling left behind. With the Greens demanding an end to University tuition fees and a reversal of the cuts to youth services, we are standing out as the party of hope.”\nTo find out more about the Green Party and the European Election click here",

This has now been marked down to 8.5%, but further delays or unforeseen extra costs could see it go as low as 7%, a rate that would force EDF to seek better terms from the government. This would likely translate as extra costs for consumers and the UK taxpayer, Molly warns. She said:\n“Hinkley threatens to enslave consumers and businesses just at a time when they could and should be liberated from the clutches of large energy providers. This calamitous project now looks likely to fail to deliver a single watt of electricity much before 2030. But before it does, consumers and tax payers may effectively be arm-twisted by EDF into paying even more for a project the National Audit Office has already described as expensive and risky.\n“The government urgently needs a Plan B based on renewables – something I have championed ever since becoming an MEP. Community based renewable energy projects, which have transformed the energy landscape in Germany, hand power back to communities, providing not only cheaper electricity but also a financial reward for generating that electricity.\n“We were told Hinkley was done and dusted. It isn’t; it’s at a fork in the road again. The choice before us is energy generation in the hands of the many or the few; corporate control of our electricity generation, or electricity generated by consumers and communities themselves. It’s obvious which path we should follow – we just need the government to have the foresight and political will to ditch Hinkley and give power back to the people.”",

Most of the money goes into five of the UK’s leading universities [2], with Bristol University receiving £1.3 million between 2010 and 2012.\nDr Scott Cato Molly will join the demonstration that is being organised by campaign group Bristol Against Arms Trade (BAAT). Spokesperson for the group, Dr Rowland Dye, said:\n“It’s shocking the Government is handing out tax-payers’ money for nuclear weapons research and that some of this work is going on in our city. Britain’s existing Trident nuclear weapons system could incinerate 45 million people at the press of a button. And the Government is planning to develop it further! Shouldn’t this money and expertise be better spent on essentials of life, not planning death and destruction on an unbelievable scale? We have pressing needs to solve run-away climate change as well social issues such as health, education, housing and employment. Let’s spend this money wisely on people’s needs!”\nIn joining the protest, Dr Molly Scott Cato will reiterate the Green Party’s long held opposition to nuclear weapons, the arms trade and Trident. She said:\n“As a party with a track record of protest against nuclear weapons and Trident I unreservedly support this demonstration. The Common European manifesto makes clear our opposition to financing military research from the EU budget and our support for nuclear disarmament both in Europe and globally [3]. Likewise, The Green Party in England and Wales believe that immediate nuclear disarmament is an absolute priority. We would like to see 2014, the year commemorating the outbreak of the First World War, as the year we ditch Trident, begin to dismantle the destructive arms trade and invest instead in peace-keeping.”\nAs a former student at Bristol University, Vice President of National CND, Dr Rebecca Johnson FRSA, has also lent her support to the demonstration. She said:\n“Research that contributes to the replacement of Trident is an egregious violation of the UK’s binding international treaty obligations to eliminate nuclear weapons. I urge the University to reject this corrupt funding for nuclear weapons research and proliferation. These weapons breach our human security and would cause a humanitarian catastrophe if used. The only legally justifiable research is in verifying nuclear disarmament and ensuring that existing weapons are safely and securely dismantled and eliminated.”\nNotes\n[1] The Atomic Weapons Establishment and UK Universities published by the Nuclear Information Service (NIS) and Medact: http://www.medact.org/resources/atoms-peace-atomic-weapons-establishment-uk-universities-2/]\n[2] The top five Universities receiving research funding are Imperial College (London) and the universities of Heriot-Watt (Edinburgh), Cranfield (Bedfordshire and Wiltshire), Cambridge and Bristol.\n[3] EUROPE IN THE WORLD – Common Manifesto 2014, Working for Peace: http://europeangreens.eu/common-manifesto-2014/europe-world",

Universities have provided support for students in halls, but are calling on private landlords to take advantage of Government support and do their bit to support students.\nLily Fitzgibbon, Green Party candidate for Bishopston and Ashley Down ward, set up a petition to the Council requesting the Mayor write to private landlords and letting agents serving student tenants, asking them to provide rent relief. This is something that the University of Bristol and the University of West of England have already done. It also calls on the Mayor to write to the Minister of State for Universities to demand extended financial support to universities and students during the pandemic.\nFitzgibbon, who is also co-chair of Young Greens of England and Wales, said, “We are asking landlords to step up for their tenants and take advantage of the financial support that the government has put in place for them such as mortgage holidays. Expecting students to pay for accommodation and services they cannot use is totally unreasonable.”\nIn parallel with the petition, Green Party councillor Carla Denyer has submitted a motion to a Bristol City Council meeting on 16th March, making the same demands.\nShe explains, “The University of Bristol and UWE have both offered concrete measures to support their students in halls with rent, including rent rebates and no-penalty contract releases where needed. However, most students rent in the private sector, and they cannot access this support, despite facing the exact same issues. They are paying a high financial cost for obeying the law and following public health advice. So we are asking the Mayor to support the campaign and use his significant influence to persuade landlords to step up and support your student tenants in these difficult times.”\nAni Stafford-Townsend, Green Party candidate for Central ward and who has signed a cross-party open letter calling on landlords and letting agents to work with student tenants, said:\n“Covid-19 has hit all areas of our society hard, but students in Bristol have been particularly affected by continuously changing guidance on movement and travel.\n“The average rent for a student at Bristol University is £131 per week, and even more for UWE students. Maintenance loans today do not cover living costs and with the hospitality sector closed down, part-time jobs they’d do just aren’t available.\n“Students were encouraged by their Universities to return to campus in September, often under the promise of in-person teaching. Contracts for accommodation were signed, but Government guidance rescinded just days before term began. Now many have also been advised to stay at home following Christmas, with no review until the Easter break at the end of March.”\nStafford-Towsend lives and runs a business in Central ward, an area which contains many private student lets.

The warning comes as the European Parliament this week approved plans to secure lower prices and enable smaller providers to compete with big telecommunications corporations. However, the plans only relate to EU member states and will not be fully implemented until 2022, so a UK outside the EU could once again face roaming charges. She said:\n“Roaming charges – a long term scourge for mobile phone users – could once again hit UK consumers just as they become a thing of the past for EU countries. This is another example of one of the many benefits of our EU membership; benefits the EU has rightly said cannot be as generous for those outside the club as those who are members.\n“The European Parliament has put the interests of consumers above those of telecom giants and from mid-June, roaming costs will decrease annually and should be a thing of the past by 2022. However, by that stage the UK plans to be outside not only the EU but also the single market. Consumers should therefore expect again to be clobbered by these annoying and expensive charges in post-Brexit Britain.”",

I will find it strange to be referred to with the title as Lord Mayor – as a Green I’m slightly uncomfortable with titles like this and see myself as more of a ‘People’s Mayor’. My background is in arts, education and events, all things Bristol prides itself on and so I hope to support as many such events throughout the year as possible, whilst also being proactive in initiating my own.\nI have two main areas that I want to focus on: community cohesion and social justice. I would like to support the UN declared Decade for People of African Descent through a programme of exciting events in 2018 which I hope will be designed for everyone to take part in, enjoy and learn from. As a born Bristolian I am passionate about making a difference on the ground and as such my other focus will be outreach into South Bristol, an area of Bristol that is too often left behind.\nI have ambitious aims for the year but as the role now comes with limited funds for projects I am also appealing to businesses and institutions to sponsor the various programmes. Hopefully, that might also include a greener electric vehicle to replace the current car which is approaching the end of its lease. During my time as a Green councillor, I’ve been involved in local campaigns that show we can, and we must, do things differently. I campaigned to change the name of Colston Hall, sought justice after the police tasering of race relations officer Ras Judah Adunbi, challenged the possible deportation of homeless migrants by the Council in our ‘City of Sanctuary’ and spoke at the anti-austerity rally last September. Cohesion and social justice have been at the heart of all I do, and will remain at the heart of my year as Bristol’s First Citizen.\nBackground\nIn Bristol, the Lord Mayor is a ceremonial, non-political role with no direct power, and is by agreement rotated between the party groups each year. Councillor Lake will be voted in at the Full Council AGM in May. The Lord Mayor has a busy calendar and their responsibilities typically include opening events, attending memorials and receptions, chairing Bristol Council’s Full Council meetings and fundraising work.\nGreen Mayors in other cities have included Lancaster, York, Oxford, and Brighton, and this year Sheffield will also get a Green Lord Mayor as Councillor Magid Magid takes up the role. While the position is non-political in the sense that the Lord Mayor is prohibited from advancing a party agenda, Green Lord Mayors often find ways to make the role their own, for example by cycling to official events where possible. In Brighton, the previous Green Mayor expanded the number of Mayor’s charities from 3 to 27 and broke fundraising records.",

The newly published plan does not reflect the urgency of the issue. In fact, it is a collection of existing projects, many of which were started by previous administrations. The report does little to identify a strategic approach or pin down concrete actions. A plan to make a plan is not what we need right now.”\nHe continued: “The technology and ideas to create a zero-carbon economy already exist and many of them are simple – renewable energy, a good public transport system and insulated homes. Many of these will benefit the city in multiple ways through reduced heating bills for the poorest, improved travel times and business connectivity, healthier citizens and cleaner air. Kicking this into the long grass by proposing more plans and reports could see Bristol slip further behind other cities, when we should be leading the way.”\nBristol was the first city in the UK to declare a Climate Emergency and initiated a national trend for other cities to adopt similar pledges. Councillor Carla Denyer is the Green lead on the Climate Emergency for Bristol. Councillor Denyer said: “There’s some good stuff in the climate emergency report – I’m particularly pleased to see the inclusion of the Green proposal for the Council to adopt an annual carbon budget. It’s also good that the Council is setting a tougher carbon neutrality target for itself. This shows the power of having elected Greens to move motions like this and push for real and meaningful climate action.”\n“However, coming 8 months after Full Council declared a climate emergency, this is still a plan to produce a plan. When I proposed the climate emergency motion last year, it was in light of the IPCC’s stark warning that humanity has 12 years to take bold action to prevent catastrophic climate breakdown. Since the report was published, one of those 12 years has passed – so we need an end to the ‘business as usual’ approach, replaced with rapid and ambitious action, and unfortunately there isn’t enough of that in this report.”\n“I understand that further research is needed, but there is some work that it’s obvious we’ll have to carry out, for example massively improving infrastructure for walking and cycling, which Greens suggested in a report six months ago [3], and is a ‘win-win-win’ solution that fights the climate emergency, improves people’s quality of life and stimulates the economy. Everyone knows these need to happen so why wait? Let’s get started now.”\nAmong other action proposals, the Greens have already brought forward costed plans to invest £6 million a year in buses to improve reliability, reduce ticket costs, and make services more frequent, paid for through a congestion zone [4]. Greens have also stated clear opposition to the expansion of Bristol Airport. In contrast, despite the Mayor declaring his support for the Climate Emergency, he remains a vocal supporter for airport expansion [5].\nGreens remain committed to keeping up the pressure for bold action on the Climate Emergency both within and without Bristol City Council, and have pledged to work cross-party as this strategy progresses.\nENDS\nContacts\nFor more information please contact Anna Bryher, Green Party Campaign Manager for Sandy Hore-Ruthven on 07786 832035 or anna.bryher@gmail.com\nFor council related enquires, please contact Paul Shanks, Political Assistant to the Green Councillor Group on Bristol City Council, 0117 3526155 or paul.shanks@bristol.gov.uk\nNotes to editors\n[1] The Mayor’s ‘Climate Emergency Action Plan’ was published on Friday 5th July and will be presented at the Bristol Full Council meeting on Tuesday 16th July.

Giving Marvin an answer to the question ‘what would go on arena island if the arena is moved elsewhere?’.\nAnd, on the surface, he may think it answers the sequential planning test problem that says big developments like the arena should be placed in the city centre before any other sites are considered.\nSo, the pieces are in place and the master plan is taking shape – the final piece of the puzzle will be the cabinet announcement of the arena in Filton on September 4.\nThe masterplan will then be complete. Except of course it won’t be. All that will have happened is that a concrete, costed, shovel-ready plan that will be good for Bristol has been replaced by two ideas that are nothing more than pictures on pieces of paper.\nCity planning is not a chessboard where developments can be moved around like pawns until you find the perfect set up. Each move takes years of planning, investment, costing, transport studies and financing until eventually, the digging can start. This timeline doesn’t include any legal challenges or costs either.\nMy own experience of large capital developments (in the tens of millions of pounds) tells me that the time to take an idea to reality is usually double what you think it will be and then some.\nTalking to friends who have developed arenas on the scale we are looking at in Bristol, they say it is seven years minimum. And, unless Marvin has been working on it for years, we are still a long way off from seeing it happening in Bristol.\nThe proposals for Arena Island and Filton are hollow – (not so pretty) pictures with a few figures attached to them.\nThe thing I find so hard to understand is that there are other places in the city centre for the type of development Legal & General have put forward.\nSo, let’s start planning those but not at the expense of an arena that is ready to go. We really can have our arena and a convention centre and housing.\nFull Council gets to express its opinion on the arena site next week and if councillors have their ear to the ground I hope that all of them will vote with their constituents’ views in mind and send a clear message to the mayor – Bristol wants the arena on Arena Island.",

Figures from the Institute for Public Policy Research reveal that the South West received just £19 per head in spending on transport compared with £2731 in London and £792 per head in the South-East [1]. The Green Party has also repeated its demand for HS2 to be cancelled and a proportion of the £50bn price-tag to be spent on investment in the resilience of regional railways in the South West.\nSpeaking on the BBC Sunday Politics show in the South West on Sunday [2], lead European candidate Molly Scott Cato put her accusation to Devon West MP Gary Streeter and Exeter’s Ben Bradshaw. She said:\n“The Green Party has always opposed HS2 which we see as a vanity project and we’ve said that money should be invested in regional railways instead. People are asking how it is that these MPs who have been representing this region for so many years have not brought that investment forward. A hundred times more is spent on transport in the capital than in the South West and people here are saying they haven’t been looked after properly.”\nDr Scott Cato expressed skepticism at the sudden apparent availability of funds for the region’s railways.\n“Suddenly, now there’s a crisis, we hear from local MPs that there is money available having been told repeatedly there isn’t any money. I am not impressed at this idea of waiting for a crisis before we act. What we know about climate change is that there will be more unpredictability and more crises. If we weren’t spending money on HS2 there would be plenty of money for opening up a series of regional railway lines and that would be better for the quality of life for people in the South West and a boost for the regional economy, particularly for tourism.”\nDr Scott Cato visited Dawlish on Friday while Transport Minister Patrick McLoughlin was examining the storm damaged railway.

The plan calls for the car companies who cheated emissions to foot the bill for action on air pollution.\nThe report also calls on the Government and Local Authorities to take specific measures to mitigate the risks in Brighton and Hove, Bristol, London and Oxford.\nThe key findings of the report, include:\nIn Bristol, air pollution is worst in Central, Lawrence Hill, and Ashley while and continues to rise in many areas across the city, including at the Bristol Royal Infirmary Children’s Department\nThe Government’s plan will see an estimated 757 deaths in Bristol linked to NO2 air pollution by 2021\nPutney High Street and Oxford Street in London breached the hourly legal limit for air pollution around 1,400 times in just one year\nThe Government’s plan will condemn an estimated 53,272 deaths in London linked to NO2 air pollution by 2030\nAir pollution is an inequality issue in Oxford and those suffering the worst effects contribute least to the problem. Two-thirds of the areas exceeding EU legal limits on air pollution are among the top 5% most deprived areas in England – Carfax and Holywell. More than 60% of households in Carfax don’t have access to a car, almost half of households in Holywell don’t have access to a car\nBrighton and Hove is excluded from the Government’s air quality plan despite the three most polluted areas in the city registering air pollution levels at 230%, 189%, and 153% of EU legal limits\nMolly Scott Cato, Green MEP for the South West and the Party’s parliamentary candidate for Bristol West, said:\n“Bristol residents are victims of both a Labour government that pushed the benefits of diesel cars before the effects of diesel emissions were well understood and a Conservative government that well understands the effects but continues to display a scandalous and deadly indifference to the issue.”\n“In Bristol, the toxic fumes spewed out by road vehicles are expected to claim the lives of more than 700 people before 2021. It is entirely unacceptable. And the Conservatives’ consistent failure to take any action over this crisis is truly despicable. These deaths are preventable. They have produced a feeble plan so lacking in detail and so non-committal that it will do nothing at all to help alleviate the air pollution crisis in Bristol.”\nKeith Taylor, Green MEP for the South East and a member of both the European Parliament’s Public Health and Transport Committees, said:\n“It’s a scandal that the Government is still displaying such a shocking disregard for the UK’s legal and moral obligation to take action on air pollution; it is a shameful indictment of the Tories’ irresponsible and deadly apathy. Every week Ministers fail to act, another 770 lives are needlessly lost across the UK.\n“As Greens, we support an air pollution plan that would truly tackle this emergency – and force companies to pay their way for the damage they done to people’s health. We urgently need bold action and this report sets out what we can and should be doing now.”",

The Lord Mayor’s office has also been investigating ‘sponsorship’ options of an electric vehicle, so that the vehicle could come at no cost to the council. As a Bristol City Council spokesperson noted, “Any vehicle replacement would have to be good value for money and be within the existing budget” – a budget which is set by the Labour administration.\nBristol currently has illegal levels of air pollution, which has been linked to early deaths and a growing range of health issues, including increased risk of dementia.

Greens say, if passed, this agreement will weaken environmental protection, workers’ rights, health and animal-welfare rules. The Green Party passed a motion at their Spring conference in Liverpool to campaign against TTIP [2] and Greens in the European Parliament are also actively opposing the agreement [3]\nMeanwhile, across the South West Green, campaigners have been reiterating their support for Fairtrade above Free Trade. In Devon, Stephen Best, a Fairtrade banana producer from St Lucia [4], has been working with Exeter based Green Party member Andrew Bell to deliver conferences in schools highlighting the benefits of Fairtrade. Mr Bell said:\n“Stephen’s passion for Fairtrade and what it has achieved for his community in St Lucia is highly evident to anyone who meets him. Fairtrade has literally been the saviour of banana production in the country. After the World Trade Organisation, backed by the US, changed trading rules giving American banana corporations’ greater power, small scale banana producers in the Winward Islands faced obliteration. However, Fairtrade came to the rescue offering a guaranteed minimum price for bananas and a ‘Fairtrade Premium’ – an extra sum of money which the wider community can choose how to spend. But corporate power never gives up, and now we see a new threat in the form of TTIP.”\nSpeaking at the Green Party conference in Liverpool, leader Natalie Bennet made clear to delegates the distinctive, principled stand Greens are making against TTIP:\n“TTIP would blow apart the power of our democratic decision making.

The trio have called for an urgent review of the plans, and are encouraging residents to sign a petition.\nyou.38degrees.org.uk/petitions/public-transport-not-road-building-in-the-west-of-england\nTransport planners have released new proposals for transport in the West of England (known as Joint Local Transport Plan or JLTP4) over the next 10 years [1]. The report acknowledges the need to take urgent action to get the region’s carbon emissions to net zero by 2030, but at the same time proposes to build 10 new roads and widen five more, destroying countryside and suburban fringes around Bristol.\nDr Steve Melia, Senior Lecturer in Transport and Planning at the University of the West of England, has set up a petition calling on the Combined Authority and local Council leaders to urgently review their proposed roadbuilding plans. He said,\n“The plan is a bizarre document, like it was written by two groups of people with totally different views. One group says: all four authorities have declared climate emergencies; we must take urgent action to decarbonise by 2030. The other says: we must build and widen lots of roads to boost economic growth.\n“The trouble is, providing more and better public transport, walking and cycling facilities on its own doesn’t make much difference to carbon emissions – you have to reduce car traffic at the same time. The easiest way to do that is by reducing the road space available to cars, reallocating some of it for walking, cycling and public transport. The Transport Plan mentions this as a possibility, but then destroys its own argument by adding lots of road building.” [2]\nSandy Hore-Ruthven, the Green Party’s candidate for Bristol Mayor, agreed,\n“The West of England is at a pivotal moment where we can choose mass transit, or mass congestion. We can choose to spend millions of pounds on 3 miles of road, or on an excellent public transport system. If the Labour Mayor and Conservative Metro Mayor go ahead with these plans to build so many new roads it will commit us to even more congestion and carbon emissions.\n“I have stood in support of the campaign against the South Bristol Ring Road near Stockwood as an example how these proposals are a waste of money and will not Get Bristol Moving. The money set aside for this new road building programme should be spent on new mass transit, better buses, cycling and walking routes. If the Metro Mayor and Mayor of Bristol are serious about the climate emergency then they should put their money where their mouth is, stop building roads and invest in sustainable transport instead.”\nCarla Denyer, the Bristol Green councillor who proposed the city’s Climate Emergency declaration in 2018 [3], added,\n“It’s intensely frustrating that WECA, who followed Bristol’s lead in declaring a Climate Emergency [4], have produced a plan that is so singularly unhelpful in tackling it. Declaring a Climate Emergency is only the first step, it must be followed by bold and urgent action or it is worthless. So this plan is a very worrying sign that some of the Council leaders who make up WECA, all of whom signed up to the Climate Emergency declaration, may not have fully grasped its meaning. Or worse, were they jumping on the bandwagon to get a little bit of positive press coverage with no intention of following through?\n“The plans are due to be formally adopted on 20th March, so we have a small window of opportunity to persuade the decision-makers to change their minds. I hope that everyone who shares my concern will sign Steve’s petition [5] and write to the Metro Mayor and the leaders of their local Council, before it’s too late.”\nThe Joint Local Transport Plan was published in January, and is due to be discussed at North Somerset Council on 18th February and Bristol’s Cabinet on 3rd March, before the West of England Joint Committee decide whether to adopt the plan on 20th March. (South Gloucestershire Council discussed it on 12th February and Bath & North East Somerset Council will make a single member decision.)\nThe West of England Overview and Scrutiny committee, chaired by Bristol councillor Stephen Clarke, has already called for a review of the plan. On 31st January it submitted a report to the Combined Authority saying,\n“We believe that WECA should revisit the prioritisation of the major schemes list that was decided before the declaration of the Climate Emergency and re-assess them in the light of the emergency.”\nNotes:",

The legal change agreed today will extend CBCR beyond the banking sector to cover all sectors and would require large multinationals operating within the EU to publish financial information for all territories in which they operate. Molly said:\n“After years of campaigning, this is a big victory for all those who have worked hard for tax justice. Public country-by-country reporting will make it much harder for multinational corporations to shop around for the lowest possible tax rate, and help bring illegal activity to light. That means more money for national governments to invest in their people, and a greater sense of fairness in how we tax profits across the EU.\n“It is therefore vital that this government, that has consistently portrayed itself as a transparency champion, should commit to – and be required to – match these standards post-Brexit. Here is an opportunity for the UK to demonstrate that it won’t engage in a race to the bottom on tax rates but will instead commit to ensuring tax justice. Indeed, CBCR should be a condition to any deal which allows the UK continued access to the internal market.”",

This will allow private tenants to easily identify landlords and agencies committed to providing high-quality housing in the private sector. It will also encourage landlords to move towards more tenant-supportive behaviours.\nIn the UK, renting is becoming more and more an end as opposed to the means to an end.

The Charter sends a strong message to these people that Bristol has a standard that should be kept, and that good business will be rewarded”.\nDarren Hall, Green Party Parliamentary Candidate for Bristol West, added:\n“There is a chronic housing shortage across Bristol. Successive Labour and Tory governments have failed to provide enough social housing and housing that is actually affordable. The private rented sector has increasingly been used to create a safety net for local authorities who can’t deal with rising homelessness. Housing benefit intended to help those in need ends up in the pockets of private landlords, with little or no checks on the actual quality of the properties”.\nThe Charter will be set out at a full meeting of the council on March 17, 2015.\nIf the council adopts the charter, it will join similar initiatives that the council promotes, such as The Food Charter, The Workplace Wellbeing Charter, and The Modern Charter for Local Freedom.\nIf you are interested in hearing more about Bristol’s housing crisis, there is a panel discussion happening on March 11th, details and tickets here\nhttp://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/forum-is-free-housing-energy-tickets-15857389880?aff=es2\nNotes\nA copy of the Charter is available online at: http://tinyurl.com/nxug7rf [pdf]\nACORN came into existence in the 1970s in Arkansas, and is now an international collection of local communities, bringing together 80,000 families world-wide, to campaign for social and economic justice.",

Nearly six years later, the CAZ has been delayed again and is now due to start on November 22nd 2022.\nLucas said, “It’s quite something to see the Mayor sign a letter calling for tougher action on air pollution just days after he has delayed the launch of Bristol’s Clean Air Zone yet again. Nobody would accept six years of failure to act if polluted tap water was leading to hundreds of deaths per year – and quite rightly.”\n“Greens are calling for local and national government to go much further to protect our health. My colleague in Parliament, Baroness Jenny Jones, has tabled a Clean Air Bill, known as Ella’s Law, which if passed could protect thousands of unnecessary early deaths from air pollution every year.”\n“Ella’s Law would force the Government to act to bring air quality in every community up to minimum World Health Organization (WHO) standards. This would mean people no longer have to breathe air that seriously damages their health. The law would establish the right to breathe clean air as a basic human right.”\nGreen Party Co-Leader Carla Denyer commented, “This isn’t your typical politicians ‘dither and delay’, it has terrible, real-life consequences. Estimates are that 300 lives are cut short every year in Bristol due to this city’s toxic air quality – and some of the city’s poorer areas are the most affected, with as many as 10% of deaths linked to air pollution.”\n“While it is encouraging that the mayor is signing up to targets to clean up our air by 2030, a pledge does not make the air clean. If the administration is taking this new air quality commitment seriously we expect to see urgent action to achieve it and a change in direction on transport. Without firm action this is just more hot air.”\nAs in many other cities, the Clean Air Zone being introduced in Bristol is required to address Nitrogen Dioxide (NOx) targets set by the government. But NOx is just part of the problem – and while NOx is mostly emitted by large goods vehicles and diesel cars, particulates like PM2.5 are produced by almost all road vehicles, as well as from burning solid fuel, dust from construction sites and generators.\nTo bring down the deaths and disease caused by air pollution we need to tackle both NOx and particulates. This is why Greens have previously called for a stronger and more comprehensive Clean Air Zone in Bristol, that goes beyond a short term fix and legal compliance to improve health and quality of life for the whole city.\nDenyer added, “Genuinely clean air will take more than just charging old petrol and diesel cars – even vehicles compliant with clean air zones produce dangerous particulate pollution. That’s why Greens are calling for a major upgrade of Bristol’s transport, with safe connected cycling routes, a joined up and efficient bus network, and a levy on corporate parking to raise funds for more improvements.”\n“When done right, clean air measures don’t only save lives, they can also support the local economy, improve quality of life and make it easier for all of us to get around our cities.”",

It also requests that the Mayor sets up a dedicated team to increase the proportion of existing planning permissions being brought forward for delivery.\nIn Bristol, between 2022 and 2023 there were almost 400 council homes empty at any one time. In October, there were also over five thousand mostly privately owned vacant dwellings, with nearly two thousand being vacant for six months or more [1]. The estate agent Savills estimated that there is 185,000 square feet of long-term empty retail space in Bristol, and they expect that excess retail space across the country will double between now and 2030. This is currently enough room for almost 300 average sized flats.\nThere are also around 21,000 families on the housing waitlist. The housing and homelessness charity Shelter have recently estimated that on any given night in Bristol in 2023, there were approximately 3,224 people in some form of homelessness, which is an increase of over six hundred people compared with 2022 [2].\nCllr Tony Dyer, who put forward the motion, said: “Maximising the supply of affordable housing, especially social housing, is in everyone’s best interests and is a top priority for the Green group.\n“While increased funding and devolved powers from central government would help, we can’t afford to wait for the current or future government to act when there are actions that we can take now.\n“The new Local Plan identifies sites for new developments in the next fifteen years. However, we must also be identifying existing buildings that are no longer used and can be brought back into use as homes, while also delivering the backlog of 13,500 unbuilt homes that already have planning permission.\n“Bristol City Council already has a small Empty Homes Team which has been highlighted by the Local Government Association as an example of good practice. Part of this motion seeks to expand their role and remit. It also looks at working with developers and owners of unviable retail space and offices to increase the supply of housing. The council must also make best use of our own land, which the council holds in stewardship for all Bristolians, to maximise the delivery of both affordable housing and social value. This should be done not just for a quick financial fix but also for the long-term future of the city.”\nCllr Carla Denyer, Co-leader of the Green Party of England and Wales, will second the motion.

The call comes after Bristol West MP Stephen Williams pulled out of a public meeting in Bristol, organised by the campaign group 38 Degrees, to discuss the Coalition’s controversial Lobbying Bill.\nThe Bill, which limits the amount of money charities, NGOs and campaign groups can spend in the lead-up to a General Election, last week passed from the Commons to the Lords on its third reading, with Stephen Williams MP voting in support.\nRob Telford, Green councillor for Ashley ward and Green Party national spokesperson on democratic reform said:\n“Many people in the community, charity and voluntary sector will feel that the lobbying bill is a curb on their ability to push an issue in order to change government policy. Charitable organisations already have their work cut. Austerity means people have less money to give to charities and therefore fundraising becomes so much more difficult.”\n“It is disappointing that Stephen will not be attending, but despite this it is important that citizens of Bristol come together and share plans for the next step in opposing the bill.”\nThe Bill will reduce the total that registered campaigners can spend on regulated activity in the year before the general election by 60%-70%. All relevant spending on the defined activities will count towards these thresholds.\nThere are also concerns around the definition of “controlled expenditure”. The all-party group on Parliamentary Reform tabled many amendments, including Amendment 101, which would ensure that expenditure aimed at highlighting a particular issue or issues, rather than promoting a particular party or parties or candidate or candidates, is not caught by the expenditure controls.\nThe meeting will go ahead without the presence of the MP tonight (Thursday 17th October), from 7.30pm at St Stephen’s Church in the city centre. The meeting will be chaired by the Revd Canon, Tim Higgins, and the speakers are Becky Jarvis and Belinda Turffrey from 38 Degrees.\nNotes\n– The details of the Bristol public meeting can be found at: http://blog.38degrees.org.uk/2013/09/30/gagging-law-come-to-a-meeting-with-stephen-williams/\n– The key concerns of many civil society groups can be found here: http://blogs.ncvo.org.uk/2013/10/07/lobbying-bill-report-stage-what-we-are-asking-mps-to-do/\n– More information on the Green Party’s democracy policy can be found at: http://policy.greenparty.org.uk/pa\n– The Green Party aims to create a just, equitable and sustainable society.

This will be part of a new deal to build trust between those elected to govern the city and the citizenry they are elected to represent.\nThe Assistant Mayor for Open Democracy will have four key areas of responsibility:\n1) Devolution – the Assistant Mayor will be tasked to implement the key Green Party philosophy of subsidiarity. This means devolving decision making down as close as possible to the people who are directly affected by the impact of the decision made. That may be City-wide, at Neighbourhood Partnership level, Ward level, Community level or even, potentially, a single street.\n2) Scrutiny – to improve how scrutiny operates in the council, including greater involvement of independent experts. Used wisely, scrutiny helps avoid the unexpected costs too often caused by poorly developed and unchallenged decision-making.\n3) Voting – election turnout tends to be lowest in the poorer areas of the city, and it is those areas of the city who feel they have the least influence on decision-making either directly or through their elected councillors. The Assistant Mayor will be tasked with improving local election turnout, and increasing levels of participation in decision-making across the city. This may include piloting proportional representation and/or votes at 16 for local elections.\n4) Transparency – to implement the “presumption of openness” that the council is supposed to abide by, this includes challenging decisions by the executive and senior officers to render documents and reports as “commercially confidential”\nA key role of the Assistant Mayor for Democracy will be to challenge the Mayor, the Cabinet, and senior officers to be increasingly open and transparent with the citizens they represent whilst also encouraging greater participation by citizens in decision making.\nTony Dyer, said “Leadership is about far more than visibility – strong leadership does not avoid scrutiny, delegation, transparency, or participative democracy – it welcomes it. To progress, Bristol needs strong visible leadership confident in its decision making ability, as well as an active and informed citizenry fully participating in democratic decision-making. Only with both, working together, will our city fulfil its full potential. To achieve this, I will appoint an Assistant Mayor for Open Democracy to help build trust between the Mayor, the council and the citizens who elect them.”\nThe Impacts of Mayoral Governance in Bristol\nhttp://www.bris.ac.uk/news/2015/september/mayoral-governance.html",
  "https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_/https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_chocolate-factory-development/content_753.html": "menu\nGreen councillors are very disappointed to hear that developers have now submitted an appeal direct to the Planning Inspector on the proposed housing development for the Chocolate Factory. The move follows a council planning committee decision on 30th November 2016 to defer a decision on the Chocolate Factory scheme for further discussions and negotiation.\nThe scheme proposed is for 135 apartments and houses at the old Elizabeth Shaw Chocolate Factory in Easton. Initially, the developers- Generator (Chocolate Factory) LLP- said that they could not offer any affordable housing on the scheme at all. Following a major campaign by residents, developers made a limited concession on the eve of the matter being heard by the planning committee and said that they would build six affordable houses. This would amount to 4% affordable housing – still well below the council’s policy of 30-40%. This was widely seen as unacceptable by residents and the committee, so the decision ended up being deferred to allow further discussion between officers and the applicant.\nThese discussions have apparently produced no further concessions by Generator, the developer, and it seems they have now abandoned the discussions and instead gone to appeal. This means that the decision will be made by the Planning Inspector, who is likely to be less inclined to take account of the strong feelings that the community have on the subject.\nCouncillor Clive Stevens – one of the two Green Party councillors on the planning committee that made the decision – said:\n“This decision shows these developers have lost their moral compass. The community wants affordable housing, the planning committee wanted affordable housing, Full Council voted for affordable housing[1], the planning officers wanted affordable housing – and even offered to relax some constraints to enable this – and yet the developer has decided to appeal. They will also be able to claim costs from the Council at a time the Council can’t even afford to provide adult or youth social care. Surely the best course of action, even at this late stage would be to withdraw or delay the appeal and start a proper negotiation?”\nStephen Clarke, Green Party councillor for Southville, who is also on the committee, said:\n“I am very disappointed that the developer has taken this step. We understand that there was a process of negotiation going on with planning officers and certainly a negotiated settlement would have been far better for all concerned. This decision may mean that relationships between the developer and the community become even more soured than they are already”.\nNotes\n1.

The decision comes after campaigning by local residents and months of campaigning by the local Green Party about the illegal and unsafe levels of air pollution in the city. The opposition to the proposed diesel power plant, which was to be built just a few hundred meters from a primary school, was a key component to the campaigns.\nJon Eccles, a local Green Party campaigner who lives close to the planned site in Lawrence Hill welcomed the decision saying,\n“This is a great result for Bristol and especially for the people of Lawrence Hill. We are already suffering from the emissions from all the traffic passing through east Bristol to the city centre. Residents’ health would have been further affected by the generators themselves and the extra diesel lorries that would have been necessary.\nHe continued,\nThe company behind the scheme, Plutus, are not an energy company but an investment vehicle. They have no interest in our community, their only interest is to tap into government subsidies. We are proud in Lawrence Hill to be the home of some pioneering community energy projects that produce clean, affordable, and safe energy.”\nCllr Clive Stevens who spoke against the proposed power plants both welcomed the decision and the strong community campaign but warned against any complacency. In his statement to Development Control Committee B, he said,\n“The inspector’s report said that the Council made an error by not considering the health of people working nearby, especially anyone working in the early evening. The air pollution would then be over the legal limits for them. Therefore, that meant extra information was needed, for example why these particular diesel engines are supposedly so much better than others and about the applicant’s intention regarding other trials or use of other equipment to further reduce NOx levels. Unfortunately, this judgment leaves it open for anyone to reapply once they can provide the necessary information.”\nGreens continue to highlight that the grounds for accepting or rejecting such plans are set by government, not by the council or community.\nCllr Clive Stevens explains,\n“It is against the rules to consider a development’s effect on global warming. There is also no mention in the inspector’s report of the development’s impact on inequality on Bristol, a major theme in the mayor’s campaign to be elected. This is something, as Greens, we will continue to challenge at every step”.",

Greens will be handing out hundreds of cards to students and passers-by with information on how to register to vote1 at the University of West of England’s Bower Ashton campus.\nBristol City Council figures show that on 1st December 2015, 316,414 people were registered to vote in Bristol – a reduction of 2,726 from the 319,140 individuals on the December 2014 electoral register. The government’s changes also mean that Bristol City Council had to remove 6,857 individuals because they had not successfully been transferred to the new system of Individual Electoral Registration (IER)2.\nCouncillor Ani Stafford-Townsend, leader of the Green group of councillors said:\n“We are hugely grateful to the enormous effort of the council’s electoral services department, because the number falling off the register could have been much, much higher. My ward, Cabot, has the most unregistered residents, and we will use the time before the registration deadline on Monday 18th April to get as many people there registered to vote as possible.”\nRob Telford, councillor for Ashley ward and a steering committee member of the national organisation Electoral Reform Society said:\n“The government’s changes will have a significant impact on those Bristol residents who are in temporary accommodation or who are semi-permanently based in the city – for example, students and homeless people. We think it’s crucial that all political parties use their volunteer base to encourage as many people to register to vote as possible, regardless of who they say they will vote for. Bristol has a thriving, multi-party democracy and it will only remain that way if we stay vigilant and enthusiastic about the positive decisions that citizens can make at the ballot box.”\nTony Dyer, Green Party Mayoral candidate said:\n“The introduction of Individual Electoral Registration marks a significant change to the way we run elections in the UK. Analysis by the Electoral Commission has shown that areas with high levels of students, young people and private renters are most at risk of low registration levels, and as a result voting outcomes that may not represent the views of their resident population. Special care must be taken to ensure at-risk groups are able to have their say at elections. This should be a priority for all those who truly believe in the democratic process.”",
  "https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_/https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_news_greens-say-we-all-need-to-challenge-airport-expansion/content_158.html": "menu\nA consultation currently underway on plans for the expansion of Bristol airport is due to end Friday 26th January. Green councillors are opposed to the expansion, highlighting how the increase in the airport’s capacity – which would see passenger numbers more than double from 8 million to 20 million – contradicts local and national climate targets. The Council’s Joint Spatial Plan – which includes North Somerset and the geographical area covered by the airport– contains an explicit commitment to making a 50% cut in CO2 emissions by 2036. Bristol is also committed to being carbon neutral by 2050, a goal adopted by the previous Mayor George Ferguson which has continued under Marvin Rees.\nGreen councillors submitted motions to Council meetings in December and January opposed to the airport expansion, and in last week’s Council meeting Councillor Charlie Bolton pressed the Labour Mayor on the issue.\nCouncillor Bolton said:\n“I asked the Mayor about this at the last Full Council and in response he suggested he supports both meeting our climate targets and expanding the airport, which is quite frankly impossible to reconcile. Making encouraging sounds about climate commitments while blithely agreeing to more air travel is trying to have your cake and eat it. Much like Theresa May it seems the Mayor simply doesn’t want to face up to the unpleasant reality that our climate change targets are incompatible with further expanding airports and air travel in the UK.\nPolitical evasion on this issue isn’t helping anyone – we have a collective responsibility to act if we want to save our planet. I’d urge everybody to respond to the consultation before it closes and oppose the expansion of this airport.”\nCouncillor Bolton also pointed out that at least two-thirds of flights at Bristol airport are taken by domestic passengers with an income above the national average. In other words, support for airport expansion is clearly weighted to benefit the more wealthy. (1)\nBackground\n– Fill in the airport consultation at https://www.bristolairportfuture.com/have-your-say/\n1) CAA Passenger Survey Report 2015 Table 10.2 – http://www.caa.co.uk/uploadedFiles/CAA/Content/Standard_Content/Data_and_analysis/Datasets/Passenger_survey/CAA%20Passenger%20survey%20report%202015.pdf\n– Bristol Friends of the Earth have information on why further airport expansion is incompatible with UK climate targets at http://sbae.bristolfoe.org.uk/planes-and-climate-change.php. They point out that:\n– “BIA [Bristol International Airport] claim new aircraft are 20% more fuel efficient than those 10 years ago and that they will be 50% more efficient by 2020. Of course, not all planes flying from the airport are new, and those that are will not be replaced by 2020. It is also very unlikely that this further cut will be possible as it implies a rate of improvement more than twice that seen in the last 10 years.”\n– “As a large user of electricity, BIA is obliged by law to make plans for reducing its usage. Its commitment to 20% of the extra power to be from renewables is in fact a very small amount and no more than they are required to do. As the terminal is planned to double in area, the total power consumption is likely to double, and thus this commitment amounts to the climate changing emissions from the terminal increasing by 80% rather than 100%.”\n– The Green party nationally are also opposed to airport expansion and support a ‘frequent flyer levy’ as a fairer way of taxing the wealthiest travellers for air travel. This proposal would allow people one tax free flight per year and charge frequent flyers the most.",

This is a really exciting agenda that should see improved sustainability and fewer food miles associated with the local authorities’ food provision. We want to see organisations across the whole region being able to easily source sustainable, healthy food which is good value for money. The conference was a great opportunity to see how many organisations had made practical changes to their food procurement bringing huge benefits to their service users, the local economy and the environment and will help us to work more collaboratively on this agenda.”\nA dozen local producers and suppliers attended the conference and made a pitch to buyers.

With around a quarter of fossil fuel reserves owned by private companies, the over valuation of these companies creates a ‘carbon bubble’ and affects their ability to repay their debts.\nEconomist and Green South West MEP, Molly Scott Cato, said:\n“Public and private financial institutions continue to pour millions into fossil fuel companies, inflating their share prices, as if their fossil reserves will always sell on the market. This is a deluded assumption. If we are serious about limiting global warming to 2 degrees these reserves must be kept firmly in the ground, which would turn them into stranded financial assets.”\nGreens in Europe have produced a detailed study into the money trail behind the carbon bubble and have analysed the resilience of the financial system against a possible carbon shock. [2] The study finds that a number of sizeable pension funds in the UK are at risk. The study calls for ambitious climate and energy policies and a quick and decisive transition to a low-carbon economy as the way to mitigate the ‘carbon bubble’. Dr Scott Cato continued:\n“This ground-breaking study concludes that a slow and uncertain transition to a low carbon economy, as currently being pursued by the European Commission, risks larger losses. What is needed is EU policy that provides long-term certainty to financial institutions and discourages investments in high-carbon businesses while boosting investments in cleaner technology and energy saving.”\nGreens will join thousands of Global Divestment Day campaigners on five continents this Saturday, demonstrating against continued investment in fossil fuels.\nMore news from Molly Scott Cato, Green MEP for The South West here",

Our moment of reckoning with this deadly virus is now. This is not a dress rehearsal.\n“We saw an upsurge of community support earlier this year, and we need to build on the bonds created then to help each other now. As coronavirus invades our city, Bristol’s community spirit has never been more needed. Our actions today really do impact on how many empty chairs there are round the Christmas tree in years to come. So I ask everyone to follow the guidance from our public health experts to save lives this winter.\n“I know many of us are tired, many of us are fed up and many of us are scared. But I also know that Bristol communities have unparalleled strength, resolve and generosity. We need to look after each other now more than ever.\n“We are being tested by not only a pandemic, but also a mental health, employment and economic crisis. Times are hard, but they will get better and this really is the moment it counts to do the right thing.\n“So say no to that friend who says it won’t matter if you all pop round for the evening – meet them 1-to-1 for a walk outdoors instead where the virus is less likely to spread. Remember to keep an eye out for any neighbour or friend who might be lonely or isolated – give them a ring and make sure they know they can call you if they need anything. Help out those in your neighbourhood who need to self-isolate because they may have been exposed to someone with symptoms, so they won’t take a risk and nip to the shops before it is safe.\n“And keep doing all those sensible things that have become almost boring: keep your distance from staff or other shoppers, wash your hands when you get to work or home, go back for your mask when you get to the end of the street and realise you’ve forgotten it. The action you take now really could save someone’s life.”\nPhoto by Luke Jones on Unsplash\nNew guidance on restrictions coming in on 5th Nov here: https://www.gov.uk/guidance/new-national-restrictions-from-5-november",

Over 3,500 local people signed the petition to save the service, which will be presented to Full Council next week1.\nThe 51 bus may be saved for now, but sadly the fight is not over. The 51 is just one of many council-subsidised bus routes that could be at risk in coming months as the council reviews all the bus services it subsidises. Twenty local bus services2, which receive subsidies from the council, will be reviewed\nGreen Councillor for Redland, Martin Fodor said\n“Local people only have until the end of September to feed into the supported bus consultation3 and help save routes that are a lifeline for some people. As cuts from central government continue to bite, we are very worried that some routes local people rely on could be at risk. If one of these routes is a route you use and value, now is the time to respond to the consultation by the 30th September deadline to make sure your voice is heard!”\nMost bus routes across the city are run commercially to make a profit, but there are some services which the council subsidises as they are socially necessary. These include routes to hospitals or those that enable local people to get to the shops. They also include orbital routes and extended hours which get council funds. All these council-subsidised services will be reviewed by the council.\nCouncillor Fodor continued:\n“In my ward we have already lost the number 20/520 in earlier cuts, which provided a crucial link to the BRI. The 8 and 9 (commercial routes) have also been separated making it harder to get from Redland Road to Clifton Village. Many of the newer routes miss out areas which may not be so commercially important, but which local people rely on.”\n“We need to accept that buses are more than just a commercial business, they connect the fabric of our community, reducing social isolation, enabling people to get to work, school and local shops and reducing the number of cars on our streets. Users of subsidised routes may be unable to drive, have a family to visit in hospital, or live away from main bus routes and face hills, obstacles, and costs getting around to places others may take for granted”\n“I am worried we are underestimating the number of people who depend on these routes. I get regular reports that operators may not log every passenger getting on the buses, waving people with bus passes on. With all budgets being threatened by government cuts everyone needs to speak up and defend such vital services.”\nTo respond to the public consultation on supported bus services, surveys can be found in local libraries or through the website https://bristol.citizenspace.com/city-transport/public-consultation-on-supported-bus-services/.

Participants in a Citizens Assembly would be selected to be representative of Bristol’s population, ensuring a cross section of participants of different ages, races, social economic backgrounds, sex and geography across the city.\nBefore the Citizens Assembly the Council is planning a mass survey of Bristolians, to help inform the aims of the assembly and what topics it should focus on. The survey launched on 5 August and will run until 9 September. (2) It will be followed by an online discussion forum.

Instead of returning to business as usual we have an opportunity to build back better. Rather than being bound by our own assumptions of what people will or won’t want, we can bring ordinary Bristolians into decision making and have them set the city’s agenda.\n“I’d encourage everyone to fill out the Council’s survey – have your say in the city’s priorities and help us set the aims for the Citizens Assembly that will explore these issues in more detail”\nNotes\n1) For further details on the Green party motion, which passed at a Full Council meeting on 14 January, see: https://www.bristolgreenparty.org.uk/news/reboot-democracy\n2) The Council’s survey can be found at https://bristol.citizenspace.com/bristol-city-council/your-city-our-future/\n3) A photo of councillor Paula O’Rourke can be found here: https://www.flickr.com/photos/140746060@N06/44587280072/in/album-72157695415220290/",

The councillors added their concerns to those raised by groups such as Bristol Cycling and Historic England about the impact of the expansion, particularly as regards the expected car park (with space for 580 cars) which would be built with the entrance on Bond Street, adjacent to the current Fabricland store. The plans are due to be discussed at a City Hall planning meeting on September 6th.\nAbove: illustration of the sizes of proposed buildings, from the developers plans. The proposed car park would be the large 40m high building on the left of the image.\nJerome Thomas, Green councillor for Clifton, stressed that while he wasn’t opposed to plans to redevelop Broadmead itself, and supported the concept of ‘pedestrianising’ more of the city centre, the proposed additional car park and its access were flawed for a variety of reasons.\nCouncillor Thomas said: “At almost 600 spaces the proposed car parking will bring a large number of additional cars into our already over-congested city centre, in an area of the city where air pollution levels already exceed the legal limit. Required additional traffic lights, and plans to route incoming traffic into the car park through York Street via Gloucester Street and Brunswick Square look set to create traffic chaos. To further complicate matters this will coincide with the re-routing of buses that currently pass Cabot Circus via The Horsefair. The air quality levels in this part of the city centre are already far above the legal limits and the additional car traffic and congestion would only add to this problem. The council therefore risks failing in its plans (and its legal duty) to reduce air pollution levels before it has even begun to properly address them. In addition there is little evidence in the planning documents I have seen that the impact of these changes on pedestrian and cyclist access has been properly considered.”\nCouncillor Eleanor Combley, leader of the Green Group also highlighted that proposals were cycling unfriendly. “We all know that cars take up far more space on the roads than an equal number of people travelling by foot, bus or bike. These plans would prioritise cars and discourage cyclists and walkers with unsafe and busy access through traffic. I welcome investment in making the city centre a more appealing destination, and in particular the plans in this proposal to create a larger and more attractive pedestrianised area, but additional car journeys make that aim harder to achieve. Bristol already has problems with air quality and congestion – new development should seek to make that better, not worse.”\n“If you oppose these changes then make your voice heard. My colleague Councillor Bolton has started a petition on 38 degrees called ‘Let Broadmead Breathe’ which calls on the planners and Bristol Council to reject development plans due to the car park. You can also submit a statement to the planning committee by noon on Tuesday September 5th.”\n____\nNB: Public Forum items should be emailed to democratic.services@bristol.gov.uk.

The accusation comes in the wake of a response to a question submitted by Caroline Lucas MP seeking clarity on how many full-time equivalent civil servants are working on the EU Exit programme and the budget allocated to that programme [1]. There has also been a warning from Lord Kerslake, who ran the Civil Service from 2012 to 2014, about the capacity of Britain’s officials to negotiate Britain’s departure from the EU and concerns that a proper assessment of the skills and resources needed hasn’t been carried out.\nGeorge Eustice, Secretary of State for Defra, failed to give a clear response to the question from Caroline Lucas on civil servants working on Brexit or on budget allocations. However, he acknowledged that 80% of Defra’s work is framed by EU legislation.\nMolly Scott Cato MEP said:\n“With such a large proportion of Defra legislation being framed by the EU, we can only surmise that civil servants are desperately trying to wade through the swamp that is Brexit. Small wonder that the government is struggling to develop any sort of coherent plan for the environment or for the food and farming sectors after we leave the EU. Civil servants are swamped; all their time is going into sorting out the Brexit shambles.\n“I am loathed to steal a line off Trump, but it’s time to drain the swamp by engaging with environmental NGOs, countryside and farming groups and other political Parties who are putting forward some visionary ideas for food, farming and the environment post-Brexit. Greens have contributed to this debate with a report on how to safeguard our environment post-Brexit and two reports on farming to inform policy makers. A ‘Greener UK coalition’ made up of leading campaign groups has also launched a Brexit environmental manifesto.\n“If the government really want us to take back control they will listen to experts and people on the ground rather than continuing to wade through the Brexit swamp”.\nNotes\n[1]Question from Caroline Lucas MP:\nTo ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, what the terms of reference are for her Department’s EU Exit Programme; how many full-time equivalent civil servants are working on that Programme; and what budget has been allocated to that Programme for each of the next two years. (65432)\nTabled on: 23 February 2017\nAnswer:\nGeorge Eustice:\nIn terms of work arising from the UK’s vote to leave the EU, some 80% of Defra’s work is framed by EU legislation and a quarter of EU laws apply to Defra’s sectors.\nThe Department has set up an EU Exit Programme led by a Director General to identify and coordinate work stemming from EU Exit across the Defra group. EU exit work is currently undertaken in all policy directorates in the Department, and in some corporate services areas. It is not possible to give an accurate figure of FTE civil servants working on the programme, given its extensive impact, nor to give a discrete figure regarding budget allocations to EU Exit.\nThe answer was submitted on 02 Mar 2017 at 17:13.",

At its heart Bundred is about getting officers and councillors to talk and work together” listing examples of ‘silo thinking’ where council departments contradicted each other due to failures to communicate.\nCouncillor Steve Clarke pointed out that some of the changes the council is currently proposing to make to its constitution go against the report’s recommendations – for example reducing the capability of councillors to scrutinise what the council does. He also referred to “examples of where councillors are, on the one hand being encouraged to be part of the consultation process but are then largely ignored when decisions are actually made”.\nSumming up, he said that councillors “want to be more involved and Bundred tells us we must be. There is no use in the council either not building in enough member oversight, or just having a process that they pay lip-service to and then ignoring the results. If this warning is not heard we are very likely to be having this debate again in a few years time.”\nResponding to the Mayor’s annual state of the City address, leader of the Green Group Councillor Eleanor Combley drew attention to the scale of Bristol’s ongoing homelessness crisis. She also raised concerns about volunteer engagement and a glut of senior staff leaving the council, saying:\n“Within our organisation, Bundred put it pretty clearly when he reported that “by any standards the degree of churn in the Council’s senior management is extraordinary”. That was before most of the recent departures were announced – we seem to be haemorrhaging senior staff at an alarming rate. I think this warrants at least a careful look at how we are managing staff, how they can feel properly valued for their work and as individuals, making it possible for them to do work they can be proud of and want to continue with.\nAnd out in the wider city, I see volunteers looking weary. From parks groups to litter picks to library friends, people are standing down or stepping back or looking fairly irritated. And is that any surprise when we are asking more and more of our voluntary sector, and at the same time taking away the little support we used to give them? The current round of cuts hasn’t started to bite yet, but with the consultation going public, their depth is becoming clear, and people are starting to realise just what they are faced with.”\nCouncillor Combley also called for the Mayor to demonstrate stronger and more liberating leadership. She said:\n“The challenges we face as a city need a special kind of leadership – not a manager or a controller, not someone who pulls power and control in towards himself, but a liberating leader, someone with the courage to free people to do their best work, but also to make mistakes, even knowing that he will take the blame for allowing it. Although it has been a year, Bristol hasn’t seen enough yet to know whether you are capable of growing into that leader – but we hope for all our sakes that you are willing at least to move in that direction.”\n*The Council’s independent report on its £29 million budget hole, which highlighted wide ranging issues of internal governance.",

Launching their plans for education today, the Greens will also pledge to ditch Academies and promise to plug a £7billion funding gap facing education.\nThe plans being unveiled by the Greens will undoubtedly please many Bristol teachers who are strongly resisting funding cuts and have challenged parliamentary candidates to explain to voters how they wiII address the crisis in education [1].\nMolly Scott Cato MEP is set to join protesters at the March for Education rally in Bristol on Saturday [2]. The Green Party parliamentary candidate for Bristol West said:\n“Last week, primary children across Bristol took their SATS tests. It would be great if this was the last time that these pointless and stressful tests are inflicted on our children. Getting rid of SATs tests would be a big step towards broadening the curriculum away from a narrow test-driven focus. Full marks to our wonderful teachers who still manage to put creativity into lessons and inspire children to learn, but scrapping SATS would free them up to do so much more.”\n“Greens also believe it’s time to end the academies programme and bring existing academies back under local authority control. Parents and teachers should control children’s education – not private businesses.\n“Likewise, increased funding is desperately needed to safeguard our children’s education. Figures show that by 2020, 99% of schools will have been hit by a funding cut [3] which will mean more pressure on both teachers and pupils. The cuts threatened by the Conservatives will amount to a loss of more than £33m for Bristol schools [4] and will put at risk the jobs of almost 1000 teachers in the city [5].”\n“Already, we’re seeing schools like Redland Green [6] and Olympus [7] feeling forced to go cap in hand to parents as the funding crisis hits critical levels. At the same time, unmanageable workloads are forcing many teachers to leave the profession, or take time off exhausted or stressed, and fewer people are choosing a career in teaching.”\n“Greens promise to invest £7billion in the education system to fill the funding gap created by years of underinvestment and cuts and so create an education system that can positively transform lives.”",

The Chancellor said he would do “whatever it takes” to protect people and businesses from the financial consequences of the pandemic. But despite the packages of support that have been put into place, many individuals and small businesses have fallen through the cracks.\nThis week councillors of all parties on Bristol City Council passed a motion expressing solidarity with those excluded from the Government’s financial support schemes and asking the Government to close the gaps.\nWith the backing of this motion Green Group Leader, Eleanor Combley, wrote to the Chancellor to urge him to end the disparities in government Covid-19 support.\nAn open letter to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, HM Treasury\nThe Rt Hon Rishi Sunak MP,\nChancellor of the Exchequer\nHM Treasury\n1 Horse Guards Road\nLondon SW1A 2HQ\n15 January 2021\nDear Chancellor,\nI write to you as Leader of the Green Group of councillors on Bristol City Council, with the full support of my group. I also write with the support of councillors of all parties on Bristol City Council who this week passed a motion expressing solidarity with the three million people across the UK excluded from the Government’s financial support schemes due to technicalities. The motion[1] asks the Government to close the gaps in its financial support schemes and explore options to retroactively compensate people and businesses that were ineligible for the Government’s financial support.\nI therefore call on you and your Government to end the disparities in government Covid-19 support packages that are currently excluding millions across the UK, putting livelihoods and businesses at risk.\nCovid-19 and the ensuing lock-down has presented the most unforeseen challenges to individuals, communities and businesses the length and breadth of the UK. While government support packages have provided much needed support for many, gaping holes within these measures remain with an estimated 3 million finding themselves left out and left behind. Some examples of these are those who started a new job before 19 March but had not received their first payslip by that date, the newly self-employed and new businesses, the self-employed with either low or +£50k net profits, those in less than 50% self-employment, those on parental leave, those on PAYE freelance short-term contracts, low investment start-ups, small limited company owner-directors, businesses ineligible for grants, for example English language schools who were inexplicably excluded from the support given to tourism and leisure industry businesses, despite being affected in exactly the same way.\nAs a city, we in Bristol all want to play our role in helping the economy recover. However, in order to do so, we need support now for our individuals and our businesses to be able to emerge from this crisis ready to work and thrive again. I urgently call on the Government to address the disparities in support, to ensure that all individuals and businesses currently excluded, entirely or largely, from Covid-19 grants are given the support they need and rightfully deserve.\nI support the calls of Excluded UK, who present a collective front supporting all those fighting for justice as a result of being excluded from government Covid-19 grants, and urge you to address these gaps and disparities as a matter of urgency so that all in the UK can move forward and build a post-Covid recovery together.\nYours Sincerely,\nCllr Eleanor Combley, Leader, Green Group, Bristol City Council\n1.

This would bring nine out of ten homes out of fuel poverty, quadruple carbon savings, and create up to 200,000 jobs.”",

To date over 7500 comments have been submitted on the airport’s planning application, with 5289 objections and 2239 in favour.\nMeanwhile nearby local authorities like North Somerset, South Gloucestershire, Bristol, Bath and North East Somerset and their regional body WECA have all declared a ‘Climate Emergency’ and pledged to reduce carbon emissions. Bristol was the first council in the country to declare a climate emergency and set a target of going carbon neutral by 2030 after Greens moved a motion in November 2018.\nHowever the City’s Labour Mayor has since been accused of “a failure of leadership” for continuing to support the airport’s expansion plans. Green Party councillors and activists (including deputy leader of the Green Party of England and Wales, Amelia Womack) will join the march against airport expansion starting at College Green at 12 noon on the 31st January. A number of environmental groups and other bodies are expected to join the march.\nGreen councillors say that since the Climate Emergency was declared they’ve seen little signs of serious action from the city’s Labour Mayor, who remains a supporter of the airport’s expansion in statements to the press, and who issued a supportive letter to North Somerset last summer that said: “Bristol City Council supports the important role that Bristol Airport plays in connecting the West of England”. The Mayor also published an article on his personal blog in which he discussed meeting the airport’s CEO and said “I am really supportive of their application for expansion”.\nAt Bristol Council meetings Greens have repeatedly challenged the Mayor’s support for the expansion plans. Along with members of the public, at a recent Council meeting (January 14) Green councillor Steve Clarke pressed the Mayor on his previous claims that Bristol was not a major stakeholder. Councillor Clarke asked the Mayor to withdraw his support and send a letter of objection to the airport’s plans, and then to confirm whether or not he supported the plans, however the Mayor twice refused to answer the question.\nGreen Councillor Carla Denyer has also challenged the Mayor on his support for airport expansion, noting that analysis suggests it benefits the wealthiest 10% of the population at the expense of the majority who will suffer the impacts of climate change. As well as attending the airport expansion march, councillors urged the public to respond to the Airport’s planning application and make their views known.\nCarla said:\n“At Full Council in January, Marvin Rees evasively said “I want the number of people flying to go down” yet he still supports Bristol airport expansion, failing to understand that airport expansion itself drives demand for flights. It’s like saying “I want the number of people eating junk food to go down” while backing the opening of dozens of new takeaways! The Mayor has also repeatedly claimed that his view was not important, which rather begs the question as to why he has stated his support for the airport’s plans on so many occasions and misses the point that Bristol City Council is a statutory consultee for the application. I really think he has exhibited a failure of leadership in this debacle. I urge the Mayor to listen to the experts on this and change his position – as the saying goes, ‘those who never change their mind, never change anything’.”\nSteve said:\n“If you agree that we have to preserve a liveable planet for future generations, please come join us on this march next Friday. We need to show the decision makers in North Somerset – and in Bristol – the strength of people’s feeling against these catastrophic and unnecessary plans which will leave our climate targets in tatters”\nBackground",

The challenge comes in the wake of the concession by one such organisation, the Taxpayers Alliance, that it had unfairly dismissed and smeared Brexit whistleblower Shahmir Sanni.\nMolly has sought to expose the network of organisations, many working out of 55 Tufton Street in Westminster and premises nearby, who helped push Brexit and are also ‘advocating an ultra-right liberal approach to the economy.’ She believes that the organisations are in breach of charitable status rules which state that a charity cannot have a political purpose. She said:\n“55 Tufton Street in Westminster is a hive of ultra-right-wing activity. Organisations such as The TaxPayers’ Alliance, The Adam Smith Institute, The Global Warming Policy Foundation and The Institute for Economic Affairs are all listed as charities or have established trading arms in an attempt to maintain their charitable status.\n“But it is clear these organisations have a clear political purpose; all of them have sought to ensure that the UK leaves the EU and then to undermine much of the EU regulation that we are currently governed by. These organisations not only have the ear of the Tory government, they have achieved a direct line to government ministers. They are also regularly heard on the BBC and have been dominating and influencing debate on Brexit and our post-Brexit relationship to the EU and the rest of the world. So I am challenging the Charity Commission to investigate each of these organisations and their trading subsidiaries to ensure that they are compatible with charitable law.”",

We still know little about the nature of the ‘savings’ the Mayor is suggesting or how these will impact on the communities we represent. What we do know is that the Mayor is proposing a £6.2m cut to adult social care and a £1.5m cut to Public Health. It seems inevitable that they will hit some of the most vulnerable people in Bristol the hardest. Over the last year we have asked the Mayor to actively oppose Tory austerity in a coordinated campaign with other Core Cities. Instead of collaboration and openness from the Labour administration, we saw more empty platitudes and a shutting down of engagement, including the purge of non-Labour Cabinet members late last year. Green councillors have today refused to vote for this austerity budget as we can’t possibly support such sweeping cuts, particularly without a much clearer explanation of how and where savings would be found and any clear vision for longterm council finances.”\nCouncillor Combley added: “Labour like to suggest that in pushing through these Tory cuts they are being ‘responsible’. I’m afraid I cannot agree with that – I see nothing responsible in closing down libraries and defunding vital services. The harsh reality is that we’re close to the bone already – there is precious little left that can be cut without hugely impacting on the Council’s statutory duties. Instead of passing more austerity budgets year on year and eroding the country’s public services, Labour need to explore radical alternatives and take the fight to the government.”\nIn his speech on the budget, Councillor Stephen Clarke said:\n“Again and again we hear relentlessly positive language used to describe these terrible cuts. For example: we are told that we can cut £6.2m from the adult care budget and yet still get a ‘more joined up service’…maybe. Apparently we can make it ‘easier for people to get the help they need’ in the education and skills budget while cutting £90k…possibly. We are told that we can ‘improve outcomes for children’ in the children’s care and support service while cutting 277k…really?\n“Why don’t we just say it like it is?! These cuts will (combined with earlier cuts) cause devastation to frontline services.”",

They know that no matter how you slice it or dice it, Brexit will leave us worse off, with less control and facing years of continued uncertainty. No wonder polls show that if Labour enables Brexit it will face mass voter defections to other parties, not least the Greens.\n“It is time for Labour to face up to the biggest question facing our country and, if they cannot secure a general election, to follow its own conference policy and begin campaigning for a People’s Vote.

The document notes the many benefits and positive effects of parks, pointing out that they “play a critical role in people’s lives; and are an important part of the infrastructure of our City.”\nGreen councillors in Bristol have endorsed the Parks Forum’s vision, and suggested some key points that might be taken into account in a final version.\nCouncillor Martin Fodor said :\n“This is a really positive vision which does a great job of setting out just how important parks and green spaces are to all of us. They are the lungs of the city, a place to relax and play, and a precious resource that we have to take care of for future generations. I’d ask everyone to contribute to the Parks Forums vision at http://www.bristolparksforum.org.uk/vision/ before midnight on Thursday 18th October.\n“As different groups use parks in different ways we do feel there are different demands and tensions at play that should be taken into account in a final version of the vision, and we’ve laid them out in our response.”\nThe statement from Green councillors is below:\nSupport for a parks vision\nGreen councillors welcome and support this positive vision for Bristol’s parks and green spaces. We applaud the work of the Parks Forum and the valuable work parks groups have done over many years. Greens have been happy to contribute to discussions, management initiatives, and planting activities over many years.\nAs Greens we share many goals with the Parks Forum and we’ll support initiatives like this that seek ways to achieve these goals.\nIn support of the vision we’d like to suggest a few issues that might be taken into account when the vision is finalised and then put into practice through to 2030. These recognise some of the multiple demands and occasional tensions in parks that need to be understood and manged in a tolerant manner.\n– Initiatives to make sure parks facilities and buildings are exemplars of sustainable building practices, e.g. by the use of cob, straw bale, local timber, or natural building materials;\n– Facilities for dog walkers including adequate bins, and where appropriate segregated areas where dogs can run free without causing distress to other park users\n– Areas for sports facilities, play, and other activities, where appropriate e.g. skate parks;\n– Designated quiet routes through parks to enable cycling across the city;\n– Recognition of the need to manage activities that damage parks and open spaces, e.g. erosion caused by joggers or burnt grass caused by barbecues on the ground, in a way that balances the needs of all parks users;\n– The need to balance the necessity for revenue with the need to avoid over-commercialisation, avoiding pushing out local traders with corporate chains; avoiding events that close off space for prolonged periods;\n– Solutions that enable volunteers to take part, without facing new obstacles e.g. insurance;\n– Clarity on the management of any issues in each location – who to contact, how things will be dealt with – and with ultimate sanctions for such problems by the authority or other agencies who can use by-laws. (The recent review of by-laws took years but is now complete, and is there to provide a tool when other ways of managing things fails.);\n– New uses of open spaces such as sustainable drainage solutions (so-called green/blue infrastructure) ;\n– Opportunities for native species and nature areas to be created in suitable areas to allow green wildlife corridors across the city;\n– A more supportive events system for non-commercial events, to ensure the bureaucracy required is proportionate to the size of an event or the organisation running it;\n– Maintenance without harmful herbicides etc.",

This vital fund helps people in danger of becoming homeless. Once people become homeless, problems multiply. Not only do the homeless need increasing financial support from the council, but also their distress and mental anguish is intensified.\nThe Greens decided the homelessness prevention fund should be saved. However, in order to do so, savings from other parts of council spending would need to be made.\nThe only service that would have saved a comparable amount of money was the Adult Leisure Learning service. At a time when £35 million is being cut from the budget, we decided to commit to protecting the most vulnerable, that is, in this case, the homeless. Leisure learning is beneficial especially to combat social isolation in the predominantly older (over 60) learners who use the service. It is of high quality and mainly benefits residents from the BS9 area. We hope that in the long term the service can be maintained, possibly through becoming a third sector organisation which would be eligible for grants.\nFollowing our proposal to save the homelessness fund, Bristol Lib Dems came up with a new plan to take the money out of the council’s reserves to fund both services.\nAlthough it is not a long-term solution (unlike using the funds from Adult Leisure Learning Services), we decided to withdraw our amendment. In an ideal world, the state would fund adult learning and also look after the most vulnerable. In the current political climate, sadly some services, such as adult learning services, may become a luxury.",

Following this a cabinet paper in September 2018 committed some funding to carry out work on the path.

After a formal opening by Green Cabinet Member Fi Hance, students took part in a debate about how countries can implement and improve on the commitments made at the United Nations Paris Climate Conference (COP21) in December 2015. Fifteen teams of students represented different countries like China, the UK, Bangladesh and Fiji, and discussed the same issues that were debated in the UN Climate Conference (COP23) held in Bonn from 6th to 17th November.\nThe 2015 Paris Conference, signed by 197 countries, secured pledges to reduce emissions that will limit global temperature increases to about 2.5 o Celsius. As in Bonn, the students challenged each other on what their countries are doing to put their pledges into practice, share best practice ideas, and consider how they can urgently increase the ambition of national plans.\nAfter the debate the students heard from Bristol Youth Council, business, and charity leaders on what is being done locally to reduce damaging carbon emissions. They developed suggestions on what more could be done in Bristol, and in their schools and communities, to reduce emissions and tackle climate change.\nOpening the event, Green Cabinet Member Fi Hance said:\n“What with the madness of the world and the news cycle, it can be easy to forget the importance of climate change. But we know it is the single greatest threat to the future survival and wellbeing of people, animals, and our planet.”\n“Climate change can often seem to be a vast, scary and insurmountable challenge. It can almost lead to a sense of helplessness – what can anyone do to put a halt to the enormity of what’s happening to our planet? But as local politicians, we can’t run away – our job is to take action. You probably know that any politician worth their salt is more than happy to say that they will fight climate change – pledge this, promise that, but working out how to actually achieve that is the tricky bit.”\nAs Cabinet Member for Energy, Waste and Regulatory Services, Councillor Hance is responsible for Bristol’s progress on carbon emissions targets. Recently it was announced that the council had met its targets of a 50% reduction in carbon emissions from council operations three years ahead of schedule. Last week Councillor Hance attended the COP23 Climate Conference in Bonn on behalf of Bristol, where she explained the city’s actions and progress in bringing down emissions.\nSpeaking after the event, Green Group leader Councillor Eleanor Combley said:\n“It was so encouraging to see young people from in and around Bristol coming together to focus on the solutions we need to reduce the impact of climate change. The richest 10% of people in the world are responsible for over half of global carbon emissions. Before you think that just means a few wealthy individuals, it includes over half of the UK population. The change we need has to come from wealthier countries like the UK.\n“As a port city, Bristol has to be particularly conscious of the dangers of climate change. Even if we succeed in keeping the average temperature rise to 2o this century (which is ambitious given progress so far) whole areas of the coast near Bristol will be below sea level. Climate change is going to affect us and those around us, and the InterClimate Network is doing great work in helping our young people to learn about both the seriousness of the challenge and their own power in tackling it.”",

They include far-right ideologues, climate change deniers, tax-dodging foreign billionaires, specialists in voter manipulation and even a convicted fraudster.\n“It is time to look behind the headlines and hold these Bad Boys of Brexit accountable for the dishonest and opaque campaign they led; a campaign which successfully persuaded a majority of UK citizens to make a decision so deeply damaging to their future.\n“Some of the names are well-known: Arron Banks, Nigel Farage, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg. Others, like Crispin Odey, Robert Mercer and Dominic Cumming will be less familiar. But all these men – and it is almost exclusively men – have played a part in enacting one of the greatest political conspiracies of my lifetime. What they all share in common is that they are part of a political and financial elite, and many of them stand to profit personally from the decision to leave the EU.\n“I urge everyone to take a careful look at the men who have undermined the very foundations of our democracy. The truth is frightening, but it is also empowering. We can use this information to sharpen our resolve that Brexit can, and must, be stopped. Armed with a clearer idea of the real motivation for Brexit and of what life both inside and outside the EU will look like, the public must be given the opportunity to have a final say through a ‘ratification referendum.’”",

Councillor Radice said:\n“This is the first time that a contract will incentivise the Council to reduce the amount of waste it sends for treatment and disposal. The Council will now notify the contractors of the amount of waste to be disposed of a year at a time. This will incentivise ongoing waste reduction as every tonne diverted from landfill will save money for the city.”\n“It is essential that we push waste reduction to the top of the agenda. This contract will reflect the importance of re-use, repair and recycling, by rewarding those who can divert materials from treatment processes.”\nThis new contract follows the recent formation of the Bristol Waste Company, which brought household waste services under council control. Councillor Martin Fodor1, who leads on scrutiny of these services for the Green Group of Councillors said:\n“We now have our own company that for the first time can collect commercial food waste if we wish to offer such services.

There is no majority in Parliament for a no-deal Brexit. Nor is there any agreement amongst MPs as to what to do next.\nSince parliament is unable to decide what to do, and with there being only just 10 weeks before we crash out of the European Union on March 29th, the Greens believe that the only practical way of reaching a decisive answer on Brexit is to put the decision back to the people in another referendum. Despite all the claims that it is not practical, with the will to do it a referendum could be held within weeks. But it needs the support of the Labour party to hold one, and Jeremy Corbyn resolutely refuses to do so, despite over 80% of Labour Party members wanting one. That being the case, it is unlikely that the Labour party would win a general election in any case.\nThe Labour party policy on Brexit is just as incoherent and meaningless as the Conservative party policy. The idea of getting a general election before we leave the European Union is just pie in the sky because the government would never agree to it. It is equally ridiculous for the Labour party to say that if it were in government it would renegotiate a better deal with the European Union, when the EU has made it crystal clear many times that they will not renegotiate the deal. So part of the problem has been and is that neither the Tories nor the Labour party are really listening to the EU, and it takes two to negotiate…..\nNobody except a small minority of hard Brexiters wants a hard no-deal Brexit. A second referendum would put the whole Brexit issue to bed decisively and immediately, without years of costly future negotiation and economic, social and environmental damage.\nThe government and Brexiters do not say how much the government’s inept Brexit process has already cost this country, but far from giving us a ‘dividend’, Brexit has already been and continues to be a vast cost to the government finances, probably billions of pounds, money which could and should have been spent on public services.\nBristol voted decisively to remain in the European Union, and whatever the result, Bristol Greens say that a second referendum is the only sensible and quick way of getting out of the mess which we have got ourselves in. Two and a half years after the referendum of June 2016, the public are much more aware of what Brexit will mean, and so it is right that the people, now much better informed, should have a second opportunity either to confirm their original close decision to leave the European Union, or to change their minds and stay within the EU. Democracy means having the right to change your mind, otherwise it is not a democracy.\nCouncillor Charlie Bolton\nwith support of other Green Councillors. and other members of Bristol Green Party",

We need action over this public health emergency, and businesses and local residents need certainty about what the changes will be so that they can make decisions and plan for the future.\nIn their announcement last week, the Labour administration was quick to lay the blame entirely at the government’s door. However, it was the Mayor’s choice to proceed with a plan for a complicated and confusing hybrid option, with both a diesel ban and charging zone – something we warned at the time was unworkable and risky.\nThat decision then led to further tinkering to try to make the confusing proposal hang together, as the Mayor made changes to exempt access to Cabot circus and the Portway. Can we be surprised if government is slow to respond to a plan that keeps changing?\nI have no doubt that this Conservative government lacks commitment over air quality, as they do over most environmental issues, but while Bristol has delayed other cities have been getting on with it. For example, Birmingham has a Clean Air Zone, complete with exemptions and support for those who will find it difficult to make the change, ready to go live this summer.\nWe now know that, globally, dirty air is now causing more deaths than smoking, and each year in Bristol, hundreds of deaths and many more episodes of ill health are caused by air pollution. Too many children in our city are growing up with asthma and poor lung development from toxic air. The Mayor needs to take action on this instead of looking for excuses.",

This comes after local campaigners and Green Party councillors successfully highlighted the air pollution and traffic impacts of the proposed development plan.\nThe proposed development has been criticised by opponents including Bristol Cycling Campaign and South West Transport Network for overly being car-centric with its proposal for a large multi-storey car park on Bond Street. A 38 Degrees ‘Let Broadmead Breathe’ petition which attracted nearly 900 signatures called on planners to reject the proposal because of the impact on air quality and congestion. Opponents argued the proposal would cause a significant increase in traffic and make it more difficult to access shops by walking or cycling. Delays caused by road works and traffic jams could have a significant impact on journey times of bus passengers and drivers and the increased traffic presence would likely impact significantly on air quality in an area of the city which has long been above the legal limit for air pollution (See air quality report to cabinet here).\nCouncillor Jerome Thomas, deputy leader of the Green Group, said:\n“I’m glad that the planning committee, with support from all political parties, has responded to our concerns in rejecting the car park element of these planning proposals. New development plans must deal with air quality and traffic congestion as key issues rather than treating them as afterthoughts”.\nIn its consultee comment (available online) Historic England had also expressed concerns over the proposed car park, and noted that “any tall buildings located specifically on the northern boundary of the site are likely to have an impact upon Brunswick Square and Portland Square with Grade I buildings that line all four sides.”\nBristol Cycling Campaign has also objected to the planning proposals and issued the following statement:\n“Major developments such as [this one] represent rare opportunities to create the future we want, of a liveable, healthy and prosperous city. These proposals do little to welcome and encourage more active travelling by foot and cycle. It’s just not good enough to provide a few cycling contraflows and shared use pavements, with a relative handful of cycle parking spaces, while including over 500 more car parking spaces.”\nIn a statement submitted to the committee, Green Party Councillor Cleo Lake argued for an alternative vision, stating: “I would advocate for working towards car free zones with better cycling and pedestrian provision and lower CO2 emissions, following the examples of other major forward thinking European cities such as Oslo and Madrid.”\nBackground:\n– The health impacts of air pollution include poor lung development and asthma among children, and deaths from cardiac and respiratory causes among adults.

After two years of a public sector pay freeze equalling a real terms cut in teacher pay, the ability for schools to pay good teachers more is a wolf in sheep’s clothing, as effectively it means paying all teachers less.”\nPay portability is the ability to move between teaching jobs Bristol City Council will review its model Pay and Appraisal policies for schools2 to ensure that they are fit for purpose, although schools will have to exercise their discretion and tailor any policy to their own needs. Schools will be asked to set out how appraisal outcomes are linked to pay decisions, particularly as the new document allows schools to increase one teacher’s pay at a faster rate than another’s.\nHowever, Cllr Telford, education spokesperson for the Green group and a member of the Children & Young People (CYPS) scrutiny committee said:\n“Professional relationships become strained in education more than elsewhere when just a few individuals are rewarded on a school team. Making pay progression dependent on budget and performance sets up a potential conflict of interest in which the school is better off financially if teachers do not progress, yet the children and families are better off if they do. We need collaboration in our schools, not competition.”\nOver the past decade, there has been a movement towards performance-related pay, but the Green Party has campaigned across the country3 to keep pay progression as the best means of rewarding teachers based on performance management reviews.\nThe Green Party also supports measures to encourage and sustain young teachers to gain a solid footing in the profession. The School Teachers’ Review Body report4 states that “teachers in their first five years [have] left the profession because of status, morale, workload, and a lack of support.”\n1 Pay portability is the principle that teachers can move jobs without receiving a real terms pay cut.

Network Rail compensates TOCs when they are not able to provide access to the railway, as is the case at Dawlish and in Somerset. The Companies can also submit claims to the Department for Transport for lost revenue due to the closure of the railway. Greens want to know whether these compensation payments will be higher than losses of revenue and payments made to passengers, and therefore add to Company profits. The question of compensation payments is just one example of how the private, franchise-based contractual model leads to a huge waste of money, say the Green Party.\nProspective Green Party candidate for Exeter and long-time transport campaigner, Andrew Bell, said:\n“We challenge the Train Operating Companies to tell us straight whether or not they are profiteering from the chaos and misery inflicted on thousands of passengers in recent weeks. We predicted all along that the extensive storm damage at Dawlish would take far longer to repair than originally forecast. I am sure passengers would welcome an assurance from the TOCs that they are not making a profit out of this prolonged period of disruption. Whatever the answer to this crucial question it is quite clear that the UK’s complex and fragmented privatised rail industry ends up costing passengers and taxpayers more. Greens believe in a railway for the common good, not for private profit. That means, unequivocally, public ownership of our railways”\nThe Greens argue that in the days of British Rail, compensation was simpler and more flexible, and crucially, far cheaper. They are calling for the Train Operating Companies to be taken back into public ownership as their franchises come to an end or if they fail to meet the terms of their contracts. They point to the East Coast Mainline as a successful publically owned rail company. An epetition set up by lead South West Green Party European candidate, Dr Molly Scott Cato, calls for the Great Western Franchise to be taken back into public ownership when the franchise ends next year and has so far received 1500 signatures.

Bristol Council’s in-house Foster carers take responsibility for and look after vulnerable children in care on behalf of the council, providing a nurturing and stable home environment.\nIn order to fund this Councillor Combley’s amendment would cut £100K from the Mayor’s Office, which has increased in cost by £141K over the last 3 years (above inflation or wage pressures). £30K would also be raised by removing the subsidised ‘free’ parking for councillors and senior employees at City Hall and charging for use.\nCouncillor Combley said:\n“We should all value the incredible work done by foster carers and I’m proposing to increase the allowance they are paid by the Council over and above the inflationary rise already budgeted for. In order to fund this I would cut £100k from the Mayor’s Office budget – which could be done without cutting staffing levels (1) – and to raise £30k by scrapping the free parking perk for councillors and senior staff at City Hall. The Labour administration’s budget includes over a million pounds of cuts in Children and Families Services due to come into effect this year, and in this context I’d argue that a relatively small cut to the mayor’s office and scrapping the free parking enjoyed by councillors is a price well worth paying to recognise the work done by our foster carers.\n“Foster carers are heroes – they make an extraordinary contribution to this council, to this city, and above all to the children in their care. Being supported and cared for within a family environment where possible is best for children, and that just could not happen without the dedicated work of Bristol Council’s in-house foster carers. Even with this increment, a foster placement still costs less than alternatives such as private children’s homes – so recruiting more foster carers is the single most effective thing we can do to get the best possible value for our children and families social care spend.\n“Giving free parking to the best paid and most powerful members of an organisation is a regressive perk and we should not be doing it. Subsiding driving instead of public transport is actively working against our own policy objectives and we should not be doing it. Telling the rest of the city that they should change the way they travel, but that councillors and senior officers are too big and important and shouldn’t have to is just plain hypocritical and we should not be doing it.”\nNotes\n1) Finance Officers have confirmed that the cost of the Mayor’s office increased by £141,000 over the last 3 years, well above inflationary or wage pressures. The Mayor’s office includes a £200K ‘discretionary fund’, of which only £70k is already committed for 2019/20, so it should be possible to implement Cllr Combley’s savings without impacting on staffing or reversing any commitments already made.\n– Cllr Combley previously proposed cutting councillors’ free parking in the 2018 budget meeting but it was voted down by Labour and Conservative councillors. Councillor Combley also proposed the amendment in 2017.",

This strike is expected to be the largest yet as they are joined by unions and local organisations as part of an international day of climate action. At a council meeting this evening (Tuesday 10th September) Carla Denyer, the Green Party councillor who initiated Bristol Council’s declaration of a Climate Emergency, will ask Bristol Mayor Marvin Rees if he will support Council workers taking time off to join the strike.\nCouncillor Denyer will ask the question at the ‘Members Forum’ part of a Council meeting taking place on Tuesday 10 September. She said:\n“What these young people are doing is really important, they are showing adults the way, and Greens are 100% behind them. I am asking the Mayor to support the strike and commit to allowing Council staff to take part, as Bristol University has done. I will also be taking part in the 20th September strike events on College Green myself, and am looking forward to meeting all of the other participants.\n“The Climate Emergency declaration we made in Bristol is just the first step. Young people are rightly angry that the adults in power are happy to talk about climate change but less willing to actually do anything about it. We hope that this strike will put more pressure on the national and local governments to make the radical changes necessary.”\nBristol Youth Strike for Climate have a petition calling on Bristol Council to “put in place a 30 minute work stoppage between 12:00-12:30 to allow their workers to safely attend part of the General Strike.” As there will not be time for the petition to reach the required numbers to generate a debate at Bristol Council before the climate strike on September 20, Cllr Denyer says she asked the Mayor the question to ensure the issue is raised before the strike.\nLily, 17, one of the organisers of the Youth strike, said:\n“For months, the youth of Bristol has been striking to protest inaction from the government over the issue of climate change. Bristol City Council claims to be taking the issue seriously; they’ve declared a climate emergency, and have put faith in their One City Plan to sufficiently combat the issue. Of course, the council can only make changes in Bristol, and it is painfully clear that national and international action is required to avert catastrophe as well.\n“On the 20th of September, there will be the largest climate mobilisation Britain will have ever seen, something we expect the council to fully support, due to their recognition of a climate emergency. Adults and young people will be taking to the streets alongside each other. Our question to the Mayor is – will he join us?”\nThe University and College Union (UCU) has already stated its support for the strike and is calling for a ‘30 minute solidarity climate stoppage’, submitting a motion on it to the TUC Congress taking place in Brighton from 8 to 11 September. The Green Party has signed along with numerous trade union branches. Bristol University will also be supporting its staff to take place in the climate strike on 20 September, according to a statement on twitter from Head of the School of Earth Sciences Rich Pancost.\nCouncillor Denyer added:\n“Young people have also been striking against the expansion of Bristol Airport, which is planning to double its size. We simply can’t afford to continue developing fossil fuel infrastructure like this if we want to preserve a world worth living on – we have to put people and the planet before short-term profits. New research has suggested the Airport’s stated economic benefits are grossly exaggerated, so I hope the Mayor (who’s been an enthusiastic backer of the expansion) will change his views on it.”",

We still know little about the nature of the ‘savings’ the Mayor is suggesting or how these will impact on the communities we represent. What we do know is that the Mayor is proposing a £6.2m cut to adult social care and a £1.5m cut to Public Health. It seems inevitable that they will hit some of the most vulnerable people in Bristol the hardest. Over the last year we have asked the Mayor to actively oppose Tory austerity in a coordinated campaign with other Core Cities. Instead of collaboration and openness from the Labour administration, we saw more empty platitudes and a shutting down of engagement, including the purge of non-Labour Cabinet members late last year. Green councillors have today refused to vote for this austerity budget as we can’t possibly support such sweeping cuts, particularly without a much clearer explanation of how and where savings would be found and any clear vision for longterm council finances.”\nCouncillor Combley added: “Labour like to suggest that in pushing through these Tory cuts they are being ‘responsible’. I’m afraid I cannot agree with that – I see nothing responsible in closing down libraries and defunding vital services. The harsh reality is that we’re close to the bone already – there is precious little left that can be cut without hugely impacting on the Council’s statutory duties. Instead of passing more austerity budgets year on year and eroding the country’s public services, Labour need to explore radical alternatives and take the fight to the government.”\nIn his speech on the budget, Councillor Stephen Clarke said:\n“Again and again we hear relentlessly positive language used to describe these terrible cuts. For example: we are told that we can cut £6.2m from the adult care budget and yet still get a ‘more joined up service’…maybe. Apparently we can make it ‘easier for people to get the help they need’ in the education and skills budget while cutting £90k…possibly. We are told that we can ‘improve outcomes for children’ in the children’s care and support service while cutting 277k…really?\n“Why don’t we just say it like it is?!

Bristol has offered places to ten children under the scheme, but so far we have only been sent half that number.”\n“I think that people in Bristol have a strong sense of fair play. We want to do our share in this crisis, as previous generations did with children displaced by World War II or the Vietnam War. If every local authority did as much as us in proportion to their population, we would be half way to finding homes for all of Britain’s share of the unaccompanied child refugees in Europe.”\nGreen Party Local Government spokesperson Tony Dyer said;\n“The Dubs amendment refers to the Government pledge named after the Labour peer, Lord Alf Dubs, who campaigned for the UK to accept lone children. It committed the government to relocate vulnerable lone child refugees in France, Italy and Greece ‘as soon as possible’ with charities expecting the figure to reach 3,000. However, the Conservative Government closed the scheme after accepting just 350 children.”\n“The Dubs amendment aimed to help some of the estimated 90,000 unaccompanied migrant children across Europe, with UNICEF having identified that thousands of them were ‘alone and are highly vulnerable’. Abandoning thousands of vulnerable children to an unknown fate is yet another shameful act by this hard-hearted government.”\nCouncillor Combley added,\n“There has been a great response from local groups to the needs of children and families who have lost their homes in the conflicts in Syria and elsewhere.

This is despite a plan to grow by 50% in the next few years, and to more than double in size in the longer term. But a small amount of digging by a Green Party councillor has revealed that the airport has no plan in place for delivering this rapid decarbonisation. And more shockingly, it does not include the emissions from flights in the calculation of its carbon footprint.\nAfter reading the consultation document, Councillor Carla Denyer contacted the Bristol Airport consultation team to ask for details of their carbon management plan. The responses she received (see Appendix_-_Airport_emails.pdf) revealed that the airport only has a ‘Stage 1’ Airport Carbon Accreditation, meaning that the airport has not yet demonstrated that it is taking steps to reduce its carbon footprint, only that is it measuring it. And while insisting that it had one, the airport was unwilling to release a copy of its carbon management plan despite two requests. The Airport representative also explained that “emissions from flights are out of scope” of their 2030 carbon neutrality target.\nCouncillor Denyer commented following the revelation,\n“In the Airport’s glossy consultation booklet, the aspiration to be carbon neutral by 2030 is printed next to a photograph of an aircraft engine, (below) clearly implying that emissions from flights would be included. This kind of misleading ‘greenwashing’ is just cynical PR from the airport and does nothing for the sustainability of our city and country. There is already widespread concern that the expansion of Heathrow Airport, which was approved by MPs last week, will make it very hard to meet our national CO2 commitments [1]. Expanding Bristol airport could be the straw that breaks the camel’s back. It is very hard to see how the airport could achieve carbon neutrality in 12 years without yet having a road map for it, while expanding the airport at the same time.”\nThe City of Bristol has made a commitment to be carbon neutral by 2050, while the Climate Change Act requires the UK to make an 80% cut in emissions. And the Joint Spatial Plan for the region – which includes North Somerset and the geographical area covered by the airport – contains an explicit commitment to making a 50% cut in emissions by 2036.\nAir travel remains the most climate-damaging form of travel, and significant expansion of air travel will therefore have a significant climate impact.\nAnd this is an equality issue as well as an environmental one. According to the Civil Aviation Authority’s passenger surveys, 47% of the UK population has flown in the last year, and this figure has been stable over the last 15 years. Most of those people only make one or two trips per year, while 10% of the population makes about 60% of all flights, and these people are mainly from the highest income groups. [2] This means that airport expansion disproportionally benefits wealthier households while it negatively affects us all through climate change, air pollution and noise pollution.\nCouncillor Denyer summed up,\n“Without a clear and feasible path to decarbonisation, the airport’s plans are worth less than the paper they’re written on. It is up to us as citizens to tell the airport and political leaders that we will not accept such a cavalier attitude to carbon emissions, and the airport must develop a workable road map to full decarbonisation before the expansion plans are agreed. The consequences are no less than the future liveability of our planet.”\nThe consultation is open until 6th July at https://www.bristolairport.co.uk/future and you can write to the leaders of North Somerset and Bristol Councils, and the West of England Combined Authority, using the details below:\nBackground\n1) The Committee on Climate Change found that the UK target of reducing emissions by 80 per cent below 1990 levels could be achieved only if emissions from the UK aviation industry do not exceed 37.5 million tons – the level seen in 2005. And yet, a report released by the Department for Transport has already revealed that aviation emissions will hit 43 million tons by 2030 if the Heathrow expansion goes ahead. https://www.independent.co.uk/infact/heathrow-airport-expansion-vote-third-runway-climate-change-chris-grayling-a8415881.html\n2) Calculated by David Banister based on the National Travel Survey data and the Civil Aviation Authority’s Air Passenger Surveys: https://theconversation.com/heathrows-third-runway-is-expensive-polluting-and-unequal-why-the-poor-will-lose-out-98781",

If tree pollarding works are reduced then the branches will grow and grow until they fall down. This could cause a safety risk if it were it to fall on someone or something such as a car. There will be other issues such as increased leaf fall – which could lead to more flooding – a blocking out of natural light and possible subsidence issues due to tree roots.”\nHe continued,\n“The council is trying to save money, but this idea will not achieve that overall. It is another example of ‘silo thinking’ at the council to save money from certain departments, but not taking account of the overall budget.\n“We could probably get away with cutting down on maintenance for a year or so, but in three or four years time the council will have to pay for increased maintenance to overcome the safety risks. There are currently 1,028 tree stumps in the city which are waiting for replacement, but today we are hearing that replanting too will be affected by the cuts.\n“By not maintaining our older trees we are essentially letting them grow out of control and to me the next logical step for the council would be to fell the problem trees.

A Director at Trinity Arts Centre commented that imagine the work that could be done if these other spaces had received a fraction of the investment – it would genuinely change lives.”\nThe exchange between the Mayor and Councillor Lake can be viewed online in the Member Forum webcast (from 4m 20s).\nThe Mayor’s response suggested Cllr Lake should have met with him instead of raising it at a meeting. However the Green councillor had tried to meet with the Mayor weeks ahead of the meeting. She said:\n“I was taken aback to hear the Mayor suggest I hadn’t tried to meet him. I had tried to set up a meeting with him just two weeks before and during my time as Lord Mayor multiple attempts to meet with him were cancelled.”\nAt a Bristol Council meeting on Tuesday 7 July, Green Councillor Cleo Lake, activist and former Lord Mayor, will ask the city’s Labour Mayor to lobby the government to set up a commission to acknowledge, apologise and instigate reparations for the UK’s role in the Transatlantic Traffic in Enslaved Africans.\nCouncillor Lake was a founder member of the Countering Colston activist group spearheading calls in recent years to dismantle the public celebration of people trafficker and Maangamizi perpetrator, Edward Colston. The Green councillor submitted a motion to the council meeting to call for the council to take on various actions in response to the Black Lives Matter movement and the need for holistic reparatory justice. As Cleo’s motion is unlikely to be heard at the meeting, she is instead asking the Mayor directly to look at her key demands which are supported by members of the Afrikan Connections Consortium and the Stop The Maangamizi Campaign.\nCleo’s question asks the Mayor to write to the Prime Minister to request “that the UK government immediately establishes an All-Party Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry for Truth & Reparatory Justice to acknowledge, apologise and instigate reparations for the Transatlantic Traffic in Enslaved Africans”.\nExplaining her question to the Mayor, Cleo said:\n“This isn’t just about monetary compensation, it goes much wider than that and is a movement that has existed for centuries, ever since the first transgressions of our humanity as African heritage people. The first stop is an acknowledgement by the British state that what happened was wrong and a formal apology should follow – this is an essential step to repair as so far our experiences of historic and ongoing wrongs have been denied. We need an active commitment to prevent further injustice.\n“I know this will be a controversial subject for some but it’s a debate we need to have and I very much hope the Mayor will take this matter to the government.”\nAs well as lobbying the government to set up a commission, Councillor Lake will ask Marvin Rees what strategy the Council has “to protect and support long-standing black-led cultural institutions of the city that continue to be severely underfunded and under resourced”. Her question notes that institutions in Bristol like the Malcolm X Centre, the Kuumba Centre and the Rastafari Cultural Centre have been under-funded and under-resourced while the Council spent over £10 million restoring what was formerly known as Colston Hall.\nCleo said:\n“The Malcolm X Centre, Kuumba Centre, Docklands, Rastafari Cultural Centre have been there for me my whole life and throughout the lives of my children, my community and others. They have served us in a way that other institutions in the city cannot. They have held deep and meaningful cultural activities over generations, offered solace, entertainment, education and have a first-hand understanding of our experiences in a way that is genuine and necessary. They are spaces where many of us can be ourselves, they are safe spaces and yet they are also spaces which are outward facing serving a wide demographic. But it feels like for decades that these spaces haven’t mattered, that our way of being isn’t good enough, something that I know other community centres have also battled with across the city for years.\n“I hope to see a commitment from the Mayor that these institutions will be supported and protected. I do note the recent securing of a 25 year lease for the Malcolm X Centre from the Council which was a positive step forward. If the Mayor believes the council cannot afford to financially support any of these centres, then I’d suggest that he could use his influence with the One City partners or if agreed by these centres, the Merchant Venturers to secure funding. Everything is possible if only the will is present. I would like to acknowledge all the volunteers and Black South West Network for their support and efforts to improve the situation for our black led institutions.”\nNotes\nYou can find Councillor Lake’s motion to Full Council in the agenda reports pack at https://democracy.bristol.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=142&MId=8367&Ver=4.\nCouncillor Lake’s Member Forum questions to the Mayor:\nIn the occasion that we do not get to the Reparations Motion that I have carefully crafted and submitted, I ask the following questions:\n1. As called for by leading activists and academics with regards to reparatory justice, can the Mayor write to the Prime Minister to request that the UK government immediately establishes an All-Party Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry for Truth & Reparatory Justice to acknowledge, apologise and instigate reparations for the Transatlantic Traffic in Enslaved Africans (TTEA) the experience and extent of which is further understood by campaigners as the Maangamizi. Stop the Maangamizi Campaign: awbs://stopthemaangamizi.com/\n2. Amidst the Black Lives Matter movement which indeed the council despite its decades of institutional racism has adopted as a slogan adorned as a footer on emails, I want to ask the Mayor what strategy and consideration is in place to protect and support long-standing black-led cultural institutions of the city that continue to be severely underfunded and under resourced. How can the council support them to thrive, either through direct council intervention or by brokering relationships with institutions in the city?\nSuch institutions must include the Malcolm X Centre, the Kuumba Centre, the Docklands Settlement and the Rastafari Cultural Centre. This question is not a new one I think you will find a similar question in the Cabinet archives from 2016 when I challenged the reality of the Council signing off over 10 million pounds (that amount now increased) to the Hall formerly named Colston, when the cultural hubs in the Black Community seemed not even on the councils radar less still did not receive any notable funding and still haven’t. It wasn’t fair then and it isn’t fair now.",

Continuing attacks on family incomes, withdrawal of needed financial support (especially for the young) and yet more cuts to public services has inevitably resulted in a further rise in rough sleeping and in the need to rehouse Bristol families facing homelessness. With the government committed to further cuts there are some difficult decisions to be made, but if we can afford to provide a home for Concorde, surely we can afford to provide a home for those Bristolians facing winter sleeping on the streets?”\nCouncillor Stafford-Townsend continued:\n“More short term accommodation options are needed, which is why we are asking the council to look into using empty buildings across the city. Longer term support and additional funding are also crucial though. Rough sleepers need support to move on to secure accommodation and help with tacking the underlying problems that have led to them sleeping in doorways on freezing winter nights.”\n“Man sleeping on Canadian sidewalk” by The Blackbird (Jay Black) – Flickr.

The Leader of Bristol’s Green Councillor Group called on the government to change its top-down approach as a matter of urgency and work with local experts in order to prevent a second spike in cases.\nBristol’s Green Councillors have responded with dismay to news that the government’s contact tracing regime failed to reach around a third of those who tested positive in its first week of operation. That in turn means that, nationally, thousands of people who had been exposed were not told, and may have unwittingly spread the virus further.\nAt the beginning of May the leader of Bristol’s Green group, Councillor Eleanor Combley, called for a local track and trace program to be run by Bristol Council using local health experts and volunteer networks. Similar calls for a local-led rather than top-down approach have been made by UK public health experts. More recently critics have contrasted the UK’s complicated and centrally-managed response with the successful response of countries such as Germany. The government has come under fire for focusing on a mobile phone app first, managing data centrally, and outsourcing testing and contact tracing to the private sector rather than working with local public health systems.\nCouncillor Combley praised the response of Bristolians to the pandemic and the effective local health teams which have managed to contain outbreaks in the city. She said:\n“People in Bristol have responded so amazingly to the need to socially distance and to self-isolate if they or their household have symptoms, and it is important that we keep on doing that, to protect ourselves and each other. Our local public health teams have shown they are able to control outbreaks. As a result, Bristol is now only seeing a trickle of new cases each day, and I really believe, with effective test – trace – isolate we could get this virus under control and allow safe reopening of businesses and schools.”\nHowever the Green Councillor said Bristol was being ‘let down’ by the Government’s response, and called for contact tracers to work in regional teams. She said:\n“Boris Johnson’s Conservative government is letting us down. They have lost people’s trust by failing to follow their own rules, and then lying to us to avoid the consequences. They have recruited contact tracers, but they won’t allow them to work with the skilled professional teams we have locally, who do have trust, and who really understand how to stop an outbreak of infection in its tracks. Instead of using our public health experts they have pushed through a private sector solution that may not work properly for months. This top-down, outsourced approach is beginning to look dangerously incompetent.\n“For now of course it’s important everyone works with the system we’ve got – but it has to be brought up to scratch quickly. Government should let contact tracers work in regional teams, supervised and supported by local public health professionals, and together we can stop the virus and open up life in Bristol again.”",

The Arena’s future was due to be decided by the Mayor on Sept 4th. However, amid growing accusations that the Mayor’s decision may be biased (1), councillors have called for a free vote. The letter to the Mayor includes signatures from a majority of councillors, including signatures from all four political parties.\nGreen Councillor Paula O’Rourke, who has been working with councillors from all political parties to call for the Mayor to respect the Full Council vote said:\n“I couldn’t give two hoots about personality politics, for me this has always been about getting the right decision for Bristol – and that decision is to get on and build an Arena at Temple Island. I’ve talked to councillors from all the different parties and while we do not agree on everything, we agree on this. They too have looked long and hard at the evidence, they too have spoken to the residents they represent, and they too have concluded that councillors must have the chance to raise their concerns about abandoning the Temple Island site and have a free vote on the best way forward for Bristol.”\nThe move follows a week of scrutiny meetings in June, where councillors were tasked with assessing the different options on the table, with 10 out of the 11 councillors on the cross-party committee concluding that Temple Island was the best location for the Arena.\nLeader of the Green Councillors, Eleanor Combley said:\n“I have been impressed by the diligent work by councillors from across the political spectrum who have interrogated the evidence and asked the detailed questions needed to make the right decision for Bristol’s Arena. Back in 2017 backbench and opposition councillors were reminded of their duty to hold those in power to account by the Bundred report into the Council’s financial problems, commissioned by the Mayor himself. This is exactly what we have been doing.”\n“Having looked at the evidence it seems clear to me that this isn’t about whether we want an Arena here or an Arena there. It’s about an Arena on Temple island or no Arena for decades to come. You can’t really compare the shovel-ready, affordable option of an Arena on Temple Island with the back-of-a-fag-packet suggestions for either Filton or the fruit and veg market, neither of which have planning approval, detailed costings or thought through timelines.”\nDeputy Leader of the Green Councillors, Jerome Thomas said:\n“We are concerned that if the Temple Island site is abandoned it will kick our Arena into the long grass for decades to come. The irony is that we don’t even need to make a choice between an Arena and a mixed-use development. We know that with careful planning and council investment we can have both – a city centre Arena which will pay for itself and make our city centre even more vibrant, and mixed used developments on the other sites available across the city to provide additional jobs and the housing we need.”\nNotes\n1. Questions have been raised about when and how the Mayor has made a decision on the Arena, hospitality received from private companies and whether the correct process has been followed. See\n2.

As a result, Bristol will effectively be losing some £200m of the business rates it raises between now and 2020.”\nDyer’s challenge follows the announcement by George Osborne at the Conservative Party Conference that local authorities will be allowed to retain 100% of their business rates (1), but this is not expected to happen in England until the end of the current parliament in 2020 (2). Meanwhile, in Scotland, local authorities are already able to keep their business rates (3).\nDyer continues: “Bristol, alone of the core cities, voted to adopt the Mayoral system of local governance in a referendum. Prior to that referendum, the Conservative-led government promised devolved powers to English cities and highlighted the adoption of a Mayoral system as a key criteria for devolution. Bristol has now met the criteria but the promised powers have failed to materialise. Letting us keep the business rates we generate in our own city, so we can invest them in the future of our city, will be a real signal of this government’s commitment to keeping its promises on devolution.”\nDyer is proposing that, if agreed, the majority of the £200m should be used for capital investment in infrastructure projects, projects that have the greatest potential to improve areas such as housing, transport, skills, energy and job creation.\n“We need to invest carefully and prudently in projects that offer clear economic, environmental, and social benefits to our city and its citizens. It is a damaging fallacy to assume that public sector investment will crowd out private sector investment – done correctly it will enhance and attract additional investment and generate further opportunities to build a better Bristol”\nExamples of potential projects in which a Green Mayor could invest include;\nAltogether, this illustrative list totals some £200m of potential projects that offer positive economic, social and environmental impacts for Bristol and its citizens.\nTony Dyer said: “Many parts of our city are suffering severe disadvantages, with over 40 Bristol neighbourhoods ranked in the most deprived 10% in the country. If Bristol was allowed to retain its business rates, as was the case prior to 1990, it would free up funding to allow the city to address the underlying problems causing those deep pockets of poverty, and reduce levels of inequality within the city that are so divisive and ultimately detrimental to all of us”",
  "https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_/https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_climate-change_fly-tipping_flooding/content_164.html": "menu\nGreen councillors have submitted an amendment to next week’s budget which funds practical measures to address a wide range of challenges in Bristol, both local and city-wide.\nProposals include a scheme dubbed the “puddle police” which identifies problem drains across the city to reduce local flooding, tougher enforcement action on fly-tipping, and development of a 12 year plan to make Bristol carbon neutral by 2030.\nThe proposals would be paid for by cracking down on commercial landlords whose buildings do not meet the requirements on energy efficiency. The additional fines would then be used to fund improvements across the city and would further encourage commercial landlords to reduce the energy lost from their buildings.\nCouncillor Clive Stevens who developed the plans for reducing local flooding said:\n“I hope Labour don’t get wet feet over voting for this amendment. We all know the spots that are subject to local flooding and its often the same drains that end up blocked every year, whether from leaves, litter or local debris. My colleagues have nicknamed this initiative the “puddle police”. It’s not so much a police force, more of a puddle watch. Residents report those gullies and drains that always block and Bristol Waste Company will have some money to clear them out before they flood. Simple, but effective.”\nExplaining the plans for tougher action on fly-tipping Councillor Stevens continued:\n“The Green amendment will enable tougher action on fly-tipping which has become the scourge of some areas in Bristol. With the money raised, the Council will be able to afford extra staff to check vehicle movement around the time fly-tipping occurred. This will then mean that more penalty notices can be issued to those dumping waste on our streets and neighbourhoods.”\nThe amendment also provides funding to help Bristol meet its commitment to become carbon neutral by 2030, including developing the city’s 12 year action plan and funding for small community energy generation and energy efficiency schemes. Councillor Eleanor Combley, who is part of the cross-party group working to implement Bristol carbon neutral 2030 said:\n“Councillors from all parties supported our call to declare a climate emergency and set the ambitious target of a Carbon Neutral Bristol by 2030. Saying the words is one thing, but the proposals in this amendment will help us start putting that commitment into action, so I hope that councillors from all parties will put money where their mouth is and support it.”\nCouncillor Jerome Thomas, who developed the funding plan for the schemes concluded saying:\n“This is a win-win-win for Bristol. It brings in money from commercial landlords who are breaking energy efficiency regulations and uses it to fund climate change adaptation, stop fly-tipping and tackle local flooding. The council is already working with residential landlords to improve their energy efficiency and now it’s time for commercial landlords to up their game. Heating buildings generates 17% of total UK carbon emissions, so we must insulate our draughty office and commercial buildings to as soon as possible if we are to reduce Bristol’s carbon footprint. If other parties support this amendment we can reduce the city’s carbon emissions, make Bristol’s offices more affordable to heat, and raise money to further the city’s ambition to become carbon neutral all at the same time.”\nImage: David Morris: https://www.flickr.com/photos/46124960@N00/199058346/in/photostream/\nNotes\nThe full budget amendment can be found on p12 here: https://democracy.bristol.gov.uk/documents/b11659/Budget%20Amendments%20Received%2026th-Feb-2019%2014.00%20Full%20Council.pdf?T=9\nMinimum Energy Efficiency Standard\nThe Minimum Energy Efficiency Standard (MEES) Regulations are designed to promote more energy efficient buildings. The regulations allow councils to impose financial penalties on residential and commercial landlords when they rent out buildings which have an Energy Performance Rating of below E. By encouraging landlords to make their buildings more energy efficient this reduces carbon emissions and makes homes and commercial properties more affordable to heat. Bristol city council is already working with residential landlords to improve their properties though the MEES regulations, but has yet to do so with commercial landlords. By working with the new powers that they have to impose financial penalties, the Council get a win-win-win result. It can reduce the city’s carbon emissions, make homes and offices more affordable to heat, and raise money to further the city’s ambition to become carbon neutral.”\nThe Minimum Energy Efficiency Standard (MEES) was introduced in March 2015 by the Energy Efficiency (Private Rented Property)(England and Wales) Regulations 2015. This means that landlords of residential and commercial properties within the scope of the MEES Regulations (nearly all privately rented property) must not renew existing tenancies or grant new tenancies in the building has less than the minimum energy efficiency performance certificate (EPC) of E unless the landlord registers an exemption, for which they must have a valid reason. Only a small proportion of properties would be entitled to an exemption. The MEES Regulations allow Bristol City Council and other councils to impose quite significant penalties where the regulations are not being adhered to. This will help BCC ensure that landlords improve the city’s buildings so that they become more energy efficient, helping the city move towards its goal of carbon neutrality by 2030 and at the same time will also raise revenue for the city.\nResidential MEES and Bristol City Council\nThe landlord licensing team has been progressing the application of the MEES Regulations and has been given Government funding for a pilot project to do this. Bristol is seen as being quite far advanced among local authorities in its application of the MEES Regulations. The landlord licensing team believe that there are between 800 and 1500 properties that could be affected by the application of the regulations and it is preparing to engage with the owners of these properties in the next few months.\nCommercial properties MEES\nThe Government estimates that 18% of commercial property lettings fall below an EPC rating of E (source Burges Salmon guide to MEES Regulations). The MEES Regulations allow local authorities to impose penalties up to 20% of the value of the property’s rateable value on commercial landlords with a maximum fine per property of up to £150,000 per property. While in theory this is likely to raise millions of pounds of revenue for the Council, our budget we are only assuming £150,000 net income in the first year of operation and £500,000 per year thereafter. We should either recruit a project manager (under the supervision of our commercialisation team) to introduce the same financial penalties system that our landlord licensing team have already undertaken in the residential sector OR we should work with a private sector partner who takes a percentage cut of the fees generated from financial penalties.

Despite the Labour Mayor and the Conservative Metro Mayor backing the airport expansion, the campaign was successful, and North Somerset councillors voted it down by 18 votes to seven.\nCarla continued: “However, we all know that there is so much more to do, which is why it is vital activists such as Greta Thunberg continue holding policy makers to account and we continue to elect Greens who are able to make a difference in councils up and down the country.”\nSandy Hore-Ruthven, the Green Party mayor candidate for Bristol, said: “Greta is calling for our leaders to make decisions for the future, instead of repeating the mistakes of old.\n“Building new roads and expanding our airports is thinking from the last century.

Quality of Life\nThis quality of life is not defined purely by wages, but by a really great work-life balance. Despite what many think, the Green Party isn’t anti-business. The best way to help people help themselves is through meaningful work that pays a living wage. And tax paid by employees and businesses helps pay for civil society to function.\nIt is the long term viability of our region’s economy in which I am most interested. As I’m fairly sure you would agree, if we fail to properly balance profit with people & planet, we are setting ourselves up to fail.\nWe have the opportunity to lead the world in the next generation of smart urban living. This is a much broader concept than just the internet of things or driverless cars. It is about the systems thinking that enables a city and its surrounding areas to function properly.\nThis means taking a place based approach, rather than the short term silo thinking that sees local politicians fighting over boundaries that are meaningless to anyone outside of the political bubble.\nIt means addressing the housing crisis within a generation, not by building more ‘des res’ on the green belt, but by building sustainable communities and rolling out a renters charter across the region.\nIt means confronting our congestion and air quality problems not by building more roads, but by providing an effective integrated public transport system.\nIt means accepting that we cannot isolate ourselves from global issues. Climate change and political destabilisation, biodiversity loss and soil degradation must be threaded into and through all our of public and private sector plans.\nI believe that as Mayor of the West of England Combined Authority I can lead that place based systems thinking. “\nYou can read more about his speech and his campaign on Darren’s website here >>>",

As a long standing anti-nuclear campaigner she has attended many demonstrations and rallies against nuclear power and is a sponsor of the Stop Hinkley campaign [1]. However, Caroline Lucas is also seeking to add weight to a submission by South West Green Party to the EU outlining why they believe the Hinkley C deal is in breach of EU competition rules.\nDr Molly Scott Cato, lead Green Party European candidate in the South West and the Party’s speaker on finance, will be attending the demo with Caroline Lucas and two other Green Party European candidates, Emily McIvor and Ricky Knight. In response to an EU consultation, Dr Scott Cato has accused the government of providing a ‘back door’ subsidy to EDF, the company planning to build Hinkley C [2]. She said:\n“The government seems determined to play a game of ‘when is a subsidy not a subsidy’ over Hinkley C. Agreeing to pay a price for electricity that is twice the current market price is effectively a subsidy by the back door to the tune of £17.6bn over the lifetime of the deal. There are other subsides too such as government underwriting the costs of insurance and paying for the huge cost of waste disposal. These subsidies distort competition and unfairly disadvantage potential competitors in the solar, wind and tidal power industries.”\nA report by South West Green Party published earlier this year identifies the region as a national leader in renewable electricity generation [3] but claims the government is undermining the enormous economic opportunities offered by this sector in the South West.\nCaroline Lucas, MP for Brighton Pavilion, said:\n“At a time when the costs of renewable energy are rapidly falling, it’s reckless for the Government to subsidise the nuclear industry. There also remain serious safety concerns about nuclear and no safe, reliable way to deal with the toxic waste it creates. Instead of locking Britain into this costly and risky technology, the Government should be investing seriously in energy efficiency and renewables. As a region already leading the country in renewable energy generation, the government must abandon its nuclear programme and demonstrate clear and unequivocal support for renewable energy technologies in the South West.”\nCaroline Lucas’ itinerary [4] will also include visiting Green Party members at a stall in Weston super-Mare and she will help Green Party campaigners distribute leaflets at Bristol Parkway, promoting the petition by South West Green Party to take back the Great Western rail franchise into public ownership [5].\nNotes\n[2] See attached report: UK Government Support for Hinkley C Does Not Conform to EU State Aid Rules: Submission from South West Green Party Lead Euro-Candidate Molly Scott Cato\n[3] http://southwest.greenparty.org.uk/policy/energy.html\n[4] Caroline Lucas and South West Green Party: full itinerary, Thursday 10th April\n10:00: Caroline Lucas arrives at Bristol Parkway station by train and transfers to Hinkley Point\n11:30 – 13:00: Hinkley Point demo with Dr Molly Scott Cato, SW Green Party members and Stop Hinkley campaigners.\n13:00 Transfer to Weston super-Mare\n14:00 – 15.15: Caroline Lucas and Molly Scott Cato to attend Green Party information stall at Italian Gardens, Weston super-Mare with Emily McIvor, candidate No. 2 on the SW region European list.\n15:15: transfer to Bristol Parkway\n16:00: Join Green Party campaigners at Bristol Parkway station calling for taking back Great Western franchise into public ownership\n16:30 Caroline Lucas departs\n[5] e-petition: Take back the Great Western franchise into public ownership http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/petitions/56244",

In these cash-strapped times openness and scrutiny are more vital than ever and this was a key recommendation of Steve Bundred’s report on financial mismanagement at the Council. In the light of all this I find the Mayor’s continued silence deeply concerning.”\nConservative Councillor Richard Eddy (Bishopsworth) said: “We are gravely concerned that this latest saga is only reinforcing the stereotype of ‘Council fat cats milking the system.’\n“The tax payers of Bristol and their elected representatives deserve the transparent reassurance that only an External Auditor can provide.”\nLib Dem Councillor Gary Hopkins (Knowle) said: “We have a strong possibility that, after attempting to keep matters secret and leaning on inquisitive councillors, the Mayor may have used Bristol tax payers’ money to hide a major problem of his own making.”",

Figures suggest that the various taxes and\ncontributions that Bristol makes into the national purse does not equal anything like the amount of money that we receive in return. We have had soundings of retaining our business rates but that has been muted of late. It is hard to see this attack of austerity as anything other than an attack on the poorest in our society going hand in hand as it does with welfare reform. As our party co leader Caroline Lucas said back in 2014, “It wasn’t the poor who caused the economic crisis. It wasn’t people on Jobseeker’s Allowance who brought down the banks. It wasn’t people with disabilities who wasted billions speculating on risky financial markets. So that’s why we’re here to say: stop punishing the poor.”\nThe 2008 financial crisis led the UK government to bail out British banks at an estimated cost of\n£141bn. However this is not unprecedented this state intervention was undertaken to prevent a\ncollapse of the British banking system in many ways similar to the only other major government\nbailout in British history which occurred in the 1830s when the British tax payer without choice paid millions in compensation to the slave owners following abolition and as we all know the enslaved who were freed got nothing.\nIt disturbs me that we are the one of the richest countries in the world yet we are facing a situation that because of reckless mismanagement, greed and quite simply callous disregard, essential services are being reduced to nothing and other givens such as parks and libraries will likely close unless volunteers fill the void. It’s almost surreal. Austerity isn’t a necessity it’s a choice. Where is the tax Justice? Where is the right to life for us as citizens?\nIt’s a bleak picture which can only go in one of a few directions.\nThe Green Party is for the common good and believe me we are pushing ahead to make people\nknow that we stand for them and that they need to stand with us. We will be out with new plans\nand efforts under the banner of Grass Roots Greens spearheaded by myself because the truth is\nwhilst we must demand what we are owed, we can no longer rely on any of these so called leaders propping up as they do the final dirty dregs of neo colonialism and self centered extortion.\nThe government will be continuing to cut money to Bristol and other core cities forcing them to be more commercial and enterprising which could easily mean that all public buildings will be sold that’s your library your park your community Centre, frontline services will collapse, back room departments will collapse, people will leave work on long term sick and so on.\nWe are being told to do more with less with an unprecedented expectation on volunteers. Well that’s all very well coming from those earning 30, 40, 50, 100, 200 grand a year who perhaps\ncan afford to give some hours or who simply aren’t having to carry the stress of providing housing and food with no despots able income or on a zero hours contracts, but me personally I’m tired of the idea doing more for nothing. We are active citizens that’s why we are here today’s it’s one thing being a doer but another paying to be a doer and that’s what’s on the table if Westminster keeps cutting and if council tax continues to rise without delivering anything for the money.\nPay more get less seems to be the formula.\nI’m not down for their big society I’m all in for creating an alternative one. Where human beings are no longer commodities, where we don’t have gated communities gentrifying areas, where we support ourselves and cut out the middle men as Grenfell has shown when push comes to shove poor people are pretty much on their on own anyway. A society that values workers with respect, one that pays public service workers adequately in recognition of the reality that society would not function without them, one that does not pay life changing bonuses to bankers, one that doesn’t endorse tax avoidance by corporations and the super rich, one that doesn’t sell arms and fuels conflict and creates refugees. We must plot our moves to another way. We must take climate change seriously and we must invest in the Green economy and green jobs – we cannot support growth for growth sake without an eye on the future impacts of various industries. Yes we need jobs and opportunities but we must also ask why we need certain jobs what purpose do they serve and this will become more necessary when we move to automation and many roles will become redundant and a universal basic income will have to be a reality.\nThis anti austerity agenda must unite all of us\nEveryone should be asking the questions of where our money is going and we need more say in where it is spent instead of having no choice on their dictated priorities such as million pound upgrades to Buckingham Palace renewing Trident or DUP pay offs for example. Bristol gives way more than it gets and it’s time to demand our receipt. It is also very hard to watch local authorities be the puppets in executing these cuts, bowing down and driving through this deadly agenda. This is a good day today but it’s months too late as Greens we have lobbied for more action and until today we have to say to Labour who voted through these cuts on the fear of Westminster:\nThat in terms to standing up and defending us the people ‘We ain’t seen nothing yet’. In fact from Brixton to Bristol within your Labour led cities and boroughs all we see is raging inequalities and sell offs. Birmingham another Labour led core city has recently voted through a raft of redundancies to front line workers causing outrage and a strike on the ground by the refuse collectors.\nGood luck with the green paper – sadly I have seen how playing by their rules has got us precisely nowhere. It is them and US. But I am now becoming clearer on the US and the THEM. In these desperate last days of neo colonialism they have succeeded in driving a huge wedge amongst the people. Reports of the rise of racism and arson in areas like Hartcliffe and Southmead – I ask that we reflect and remember our collective histories particularly as marginalized and oppressed people of all shades of skin colour. Whilst the press gang will no longer be out tonight to hit you over the head in the pub and drag you onto slave ships to administer the dirty work and whilst the whip and shackle are no longer in the physical, most of us remain subdued and dupped still being co opted on the grand plantation of capitalism and debt . So much chat about Colston and as a founder member of the campaign group ‘Countering Colston’ let me tell you this that until the young white citizens in areas like Hartcliffe and Southmead call for the statue to fall, then removing it means less to me because until a huge section of people wake up and smell the myths we cannot actually move on.\nWe are living in an emperors new clothes situation where the sell is that everything is important apart from each other and the planet. The planet being the ultimate elephant in the room because without her we are no more. Climate change is real and it isn’t any of us to blame, sure we can adjust our lifestyles here and there but no, capitalism is to blame, the war on want is to blame, the pillaging of land for capital gains is to blame, the over riding dismissal and continual genocide of First Nation people is to blame, the love of money above all else is to blame. We need a values overhaul and we need it fast.\nNow is the time to choose our own clothes and wear them.\nEnd austerity or else.\nStop the cuts or else.\nSocial justice now or else.\nAnd I predict that the all else will have to be boycotts strikes and a return of the occupy movement.\nI am a proud Bristolian honored by standing here today to say these words which you can take or leave. History is made by the brave and by the bold and the history that we want to write is in our hands.",

I have met people who pay extortionate rent, yet have daily battles to get their landlord to fix a broken toilet or mend a leaking roof.”\n“The Stapleton Road licencing scheme3 has successfully improved 700 private rented properties and resolved 199 serious hazards, by cracking down on rogue landlords. We are now calling on the Mayor to look at extending the scheme to other areas of the city, following consultation with local communities.”\nCracking down on landlords who do not provide basic standards is particularly important for students who rent across the city. Stephen Le Fanu, Student Living Officer at Bristol Students Union and member of ACORN student group at Bristol University said:\n“Our recent student housing survey showed that both University of Bristol and University of West of England students are frequently having to live in poor conditions and are charged rip-off fees. This is simply not acceptable. We have formed a group of students from across the city to tackle together some of the problems that students are individually facing and want to invite all those interested to get involved.”\nNick Ballard from Community housing organisation, ACORN who have been campaigning for ethical lettings across Bristol said:\n“Like any business, private rentals must be properly regulated and decent standards ensured. Landlord licensing is a vital first step in creating a register of landlords that will allow much-needed oversight. Permitting local authorities to inspect privately-rented property as a matter of course will protect tenants from the revenge evictions that too-often follow when we complain ourselves. ACORN is committed to the creation of a progressive and fair rental sector and landlord licensing is a fundamental requirement for this.”\nGreen Councillor Clive Stevens, who also represents Clifton Down concluded:\n“Landlords shouldn’t be able to profit from other peoples’ misery, they should be made to offer premises to an acceptable standard, in other walks of life businesses have to comply with the trades descriptions act, why not landlords?”\nENDS\nNotes\nEarlier this month a landlord couple were fined tens of thousands of pounds under the landlord licencing scheme in Easton: http://news.bristol.gov.uk/landlords-fined-for-not-having-the-correct-licences/\nThe Big Housing Conversation will be held on Sept 7th: https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/the-big-housing-conversation-tickets-26699712559\nThe Stapleton Road Licencing Scheme was started in 2013, and after its success at improving standards the scheme was extended to St George West and Eastville in Feb 2016.",

They are calling on UK politicians at all levels to endorse the call for a rapid transition to a renewable energy future.\nThe IPCC says that clean energy will have to increase threefold by 2050 if the earth is to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, with an emphasis on wind and solar power. [1] Like the Greens, the IPCC is sceptical about the contribution that can be made to decarbonising our electricity supply by nuclear, which it considers to be too costly. Its authors also question the wisdom of relying on technologies that do not currently exist, such as Carbon Capture and Storage.\nThe proposals in the IPCC report chime with those of a South West Green Party report, South West: Energy Region [2], that was recently presented to Bristol Mayor George Ferguson. The report draws attention to the widespread employment opportunities offered by renewable energy in the South West but claims that mixed messages from national government are undermining the economic opportunities offered by this sector. The South West is already a national leader in renewable electricity generation but this could be expanding more rapidly.\nDr Molly Scott Cato, lead Green Party European candidate in the South West, said:\n“The latest report from the IPCC has some really good news for us here in the South West. The scientists are arguing that we need to expand our renewable energy generation and the South West already has considerable expertise in this area, in marine power as well as wind and solar. We could be looking at thousands of new jobs producing clean, safe electricity and helping to solve the urgent problem of climate change. It really is a win-win and all that is holding us back is a lack of imagination on the part of our dinosaur politicians. “\nThe Greens’ report draws inspiration from the impressive speed of the energy transition in Germany, where the government has completely abandoned nuclear and set itself the ambitious goal of doubling the renewable electricity generation to 35% by 2020 and achieving 80% renewable electricity generation by 2050.\nDr Scott Cato concluded:\n“The rapid transition in Germany is being achieved as a result of public and community ownership of renewables, including a fivefold increase in the number of renewable energy co-operatives between 2007 (101) and 2011 (586) [3]. We want to see the UK government supporting such ‘power to the people’ in the form of a long-term, high-rate feed-in tariff for all renewables, but with a higher rate for community-owned installations.”\nNotes\n[1] Guardian: UN urges huge increase in green energy to avert climate disaster: http://bit.ly/Q1RBeX\n[2] The South West: Energy Region: http://bit.ly/RhKcJc An appeal for political commitment to ensure both economic and environmental benefit by Molly Scott Cato, Finance Speaker for the Green Party and Councillor Gus Hoyt, Deputy Mayor for the Environment, Bristol City Council\n[3] The German Energiewende (Energy transition) website: http://energytransition.de/2012/10/key-findings/",

Green councillors are opposed to the expansion, highlighting how the increase in the airport’s capacity – which would see passenger numbers more than double from 8 million to 20 million – contradicts local and national climate targets. The Council’s Joint Spatial Plan – which includes North Somerset and the geographical area covered by the airport– contains an explicit commitment to making a 50% cut in CO2 emissions by 2036. Bristol is also committed to being carbon neutral by 2050, a goal adopted by the previous Mayor George Ferguson which has continued under Marvin Rees.\nGreen councillors submitted motions to Council meetings in December and January opposed to the airport expansion, and in last week’s Council meeting Councillor Charlie Bolton pressed the Labour Mayor on the issue.\nCouncillor Bolton said:\n“I asked the Mayor about this at the last Full Council and in response he suggested he supports both meeting our climate targets and expanding the airport, which is quite frankly impossible to reconcile. Making encouraging sounds about climate commitments while blithely agreeing to more air travel is trying to have your cake and eat it. Much like Theresa May it seems the Mayor simply doesn’t want to face up to the unpleasant reality that our climate change targets are incompatible with further expanding airports and air travel in the UK.\nPolitical evasion on this issue isn’t helping anyone – we have a collective responsibility to act if we want to save our planet. I’d urge everybody to respond to the consultation before it closes and oppose the expansion of this airport.”\nCouncillor Bolton also pointed out that at least two-thirds of flights at Bristol airport are taken by domestic passengers with an income above the national average. In other words, support for airport expansion is clearly weighted to benefit the more wealthy. (1)\nBackground\n– Fill in the airport consultation at https://www.bristolairportfuture.com/have-your-say/\n1) CAA Passenger Survey Report 2015 Table 10.2 – http://www.caa.co.uk/uploadedFiles/CAA/Content/Standard_Content/Data_and_analysis/Datasets/Passenger_survey/CAA%20Passenger%20survey%20report%202015.pdf\n– Bristol Friends of the Earth have information on why further airport expansion is incompatible with UK climate targets at http://sbae.bristolfoe.org.uk/planes-and-climate-change.php. They point out that:\n– “BIA [Bristol International Airport] claim new aircraft are 20% more fuel efficient than those 10 years ago and that they will be 50% more efficient by 2020. Of course, not all planes flying from the airport are new, and those that are will not be replaced by 2020. It is also very unlikely that this further cut will be possible as it implies a rate of improvement more than twice that seen in the last 10 years.”\n– “As a large user of electricity, BIA is obliged by law to make plans for reducing its usage. Its commitment to 20% of the extra power to be from renewables is in fact a very small amount and no more than they are required to do. As the terminal is planned to double in area, the total power consumption is likely to double, and thus this commitment amounts to the climate changing emissions from the terminal increasing by 80% rather than 100%.”\n– The Green party nationally are also opposed to airport expansion and support a ‘frequent flyer levy’ as a fairer way of taxing the wealthiest travellers for air travel. This proposal would allow people one tax free flight per year and charge frequent flyers the most.",

As local councillors, we have tried to provide as much information as possible through local magazines and newsletters, but getting up to date news that keeps people informed has not always been easy.”\n“Now, with additional financing being sought, it’s time for an open approach and a commitment to keeping everyone abreast of progress and timescales. This is why I’m seeking a public assurance from the Mayor that residents, traders and us as elected representatives are kept informed in a timely and accurate manner. Let’s use this opportunity for a new start, and work together for the speedy completion of this troubled development.”\nThe council has made clear its priority is completing the new flats, library, public toilets, and restoring the shoppers’ car park. The old baths building will take longer. The value of the development will ensure no overall cost to the council (see: https://www2.bristol.gov.uk/committee/2016/ua/ua000/0405_6.pdf).\nCouncillor Fodor is also asking that there should be a commitment to learning lessons from the experience.\nImage: Rob Brewer\nNotes:\nCllr Fodor’s question to the Mayor:\nQUESTION SUBMITTED BY GREEN COUNCILLORS to CABINET – Tues 5th April\nAGENDA ITEM 6: Funding to complete Bristol North Baths Development\nCllr Martin Fodor\nI welcome steps being taken to complete the long running development fiasco of Bristol North Baths which started a decade ago.\nI gather that once contracts are in place and work restarts there is due to be an 8 week completion of the modern parts of the development. This is good news as new residents are keen for their flats (some have even sadly lost mortgage offers along the way). The public toilets need to be reinstated on the site; and then once its fit out is completed the relocation of the library is good news that many residents have been waiting years for.\nIt’s also positive that the opportunity is being taken to reopen negotiations with the Bishopston Medical Practice, as their current plans are only temporary and are going to affect local residents (as was clear in Development Control).\nCan the Mayor assure local residents, traders and councillors that:\nAfter a decade of plans and development issues, steps are being taken to ensure that Bristol North Baths will be put back on track for completion. Can you assure us that ward Cllrs and local residents will be kept fully informed so that accurate information is made available in a timely manner and that the restoration of the shopper’s car park is in the early list of things to be completed, as local traders need to know this.\nSome of the problems that have beleaguered this project are bad luck, but it is clear that over the decade long lifetime of the project, mistakes have been made by the Council. Can you confirm that, without delaying the development further, a full and publicly available review of the project once completed will be made so that similar mistakes are not made again?”",

Out of nearly 34 million people who voted in the UK, only 1.4 million more people voted to Leave than to Remain. In Bristol, nearly two thirds of people who voted (62%) voted to Remain in the EU.\nWhilst the referendum result itself should be respected, the fact is that such a small margin in the UK to leave the EU (51.9% to 48.1%) in such a momentous and irrevocable decision should not be enough to put our and our children’s and grandchildren’s future at risk. In England and Wales, young people under 18 did not have a vote, even though the result will impact even more on them in the future. Their right to study, work and live (and retire) in the EU will become more difficult as restrictions are imposed. The Green Party has always said that 16 and 17 year olds should have the right to vote.\nPost the EU referendum, the pound has already fallen to its lowest level in over 30 years, and there are already signs of the economy slowing down. The future of EU citizens living in Britain is uncertain, with Theresa May, the leading contender to become Prime Minister after David Cameron’s resignation, refusing to give any guarantees regarding their future; many are worried.\nBecause this decision, if implemented by the UK, will be in effect irreversible, the Green Party is calling for people to be given a second opportunity to vote on leaving the EU once the British Government has proposed its terms for leaving. Under Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty of the EU, the process to leave the EU cannot begin unless and until the UK gives notice to the European Council of its intention to leave. The Green Party believes that parliament must be given an opportunity to vote on the terms it proposes to ask for, since nobody yet knows under what terms the UK Government will seek to leave. Therefore it is right that the people of the UK are given an opportunity to voice their opinion on this in a referendum before any notification under Article 50 to leave the EU is given by the UK Government to the European Council.\nIt is important that we do not simply allow our children’s future to be possibly thrown away without challenging it and asking questions, and if necessary, taking action to stop it.",

I’m glad resident’s concerns have finally been listened to by Openreach. And it’s good that they are now working with the Council to give residents 28 days’ notice before installing new telegraph poles – though I think this should be expanded to cover everyone in Bristol, not just those living in Conservation Areas.\n“I will be following up with Openreach to ensure that they engage with me and other councillors before carrying out disruptive work in our wards.

The motion, submitted to Full Council by Southville councillor Stephen Clarke, calls on the Mayor to consider the strong public support for a Temple Meads arena location and act on the wishes of the Arena petitioners. Over 4700 people have now signed this petition, which will also be debated at the meeting and calls for the Mayor to support a Temple Meads arena.\nThe motion (full text available here – Green_Group_Motion_1_-_Bristol_Arena.pdf) put forward by the Greens lists a number of reasons in support of a city centre arena site over Filton, including:\nThe motion also suggests that a Filton location doesn’t make sense as it would require over £100 million of public investment in local infrastructure, would be almost entirely car-centric in terms of access causing significant congestion and air pollution, and see economic benefits going to South Gloucestershire rather than deprived areas of Central and South Bristol. It notes that the vast majority of profits from such a location would go to the Malaysian-owned YTL Group rather than Bristol Council.\nCouncillor Stephen Clarke said:\n“If there is going to be a new arena, it should be in the right location. There’s a huge degree of public support for one in the city centre and rightly so – why should a Bristol arena be built outside the City where most of the benefits go to South Gloucestershire and a Malaysian company, instead of right here where it would benefit everyone? With support from across the political spectrum this is an opportunity for Bristol’s councillors to show their preference for the arena’s location before the Mayor makes his decision at the beginning of May.”\nMeanwhile councillors have been trying to get more details on the ‘Value for Money’ study the Mayor has commissioned from consultants KPMG to support his decision. Green councillor Martin Fodor asked for the study’s terms of reference at a cabinet meeting of January 23rd but said almost two months later he has still not received a full account.\nCouncillor Fodor said:\n“The persistent lack of transparency around this whole process, particularly the Mayor’s KPMG study, is really worrying given the importance of this arena to the future of Bristol. Councillors are still in the dark on important aspects of this study. Any decision to rethink the location of the arena should happen through an informed, democratic and transparent process. It should not be a decision taken behind closed doors and potentially unduly influenced by big business and shaped by inappropriate criteria.”",

Analysis of Defra data by the Green Party on CAP payments has revealed that sizeable sums of money are being diverted away from smaller farms towards large corporations.\nIn particular, the Green Party points to a payment of nearly £2 million last year to Serco Regional Services for ‘supporting a step change in the international performance of companies in Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly’ The Serco Group is currently the subject of a criminal investigation following allegations they billed the Ministry of Justice for monitoring 3,000 non-existent offenders on a lucrative electronic tagging contract.

This amounts to nothing less than corporate welfare.”\nThe Green Party believes such revelations make the need for radical reform of the CAP payments’ system even more urgent. Whilst accepting and supporting the use of EU subsidies for farming, the Green Party is calling for a new Green vision for the agricultural sector.

The Green Party has long stood against austerity. As Caroline Lucas said back in 2014, “It wasn’t the poor who caused the economic crisis. It wasn’t people on Jobseeker’s Allowance who brought down the banks. It wasn’t people with disabilities who wasted billions speculating on risky financial markets. So that’s why we’re here to say: stop punishing the poor.”\nUndoubtedly, our poorest will suffer most from the cuts to local services, but all of us in Bristol are going to feel the impact over the next few years as valued services disappear. It can be difficult to grasp the scale of these cuts. Bristol City Council has cut tens of millions of pounds from the budget every year as the central government contribution to the budget has been pared away. With the current consultation many people are starting to see what is at risk – for example in the potential loss of around two thirds of Bristol’s libraries – but even if all those cuts are made we will still be a long way short of balancing our budget.\nIn 2010, 80% of local authority funding came from central government through the revenue support grant; by 2020 the government plans to cut that to zero. Meanwhile a proposal to allow councils to replace at least part of that by keeping their own business rate income has mysteriously disappeared from this year’s Queen’s Speech. Research has shown that the deepest cuts have been to authorities in urban areas with concentrations of deprivation, like Bristol. Over the last 7 years poorer councils have been forced to cut local services by up to 9 times more than more affluent areas. We have to keep challenging the myth that austerity is some kind of economic necessity, or that it even makes sense – Portugal’s sustained economic growth since its rejection of austerity shows the idea up as the nonsense it really is.\nWe have to keep standing up and saying that the services we want simply cannot be provided within the budgets proposed. It is not acceptable to cut public services and lose vital shared spaces like libraries forever. It is not acceptable to cut funding now to preventative public health and social support and shove higher costs onto the taxpayers a few years down the line. It is not acceptable to hit our poorest households with a huge tax rise by cutting the Council Tax Reduction Scheme. We will be proud to stand up and make these points on the streets of Bristol on 9th September. And every day, in opposition, we’ll also continue to challenge the worst cuts.\nThese cuts, let there be no mistake, are being doled out by the Labour administration, who despite their supposed rejection of austerity continue to hide behind Conservative rhetoric of ‘efficiency’ and ‘responsibility’ while voting to slash vital local services. Several times Green Councillors have made constructive suggestions, proposing amendments that would have worked within the limited budget to lessen the worst impacts. The Labour administration has responded by refusing to engage, nodding through deep cuts to Bristol’s services rather than consider suggestions from any other groups. So yes, we will be marching to call for an end to austerity being inflicted by central government on cities like Bristol, but also to remind Marvin and the local Labour group of their responsibility to protect the poorest in our city.\nContact:\nEleanor Combley\nCllr.Eleanor.Combley@bristol.gov.uk\n07584 370427\nGreen Councillor Group\nBristol City Council\nTel: 0117 3526155",

They cite three strong arguments for not proceeding with the controversial Hinkley C power plant: European Competition law; cost and delay, and the irrelevance of nuclear for future electricity generation. These are in addition to the crucial issues of safety and the unresolved question of what to do with nuclear waste, say the Green Party.\nMolly Scott Cato, Green MEP for the South West and long time campaigner against nuclear, said: “Its time to abandon nuclear power. The government’s whole nuclear strategy is legally questionable; fails to offer us energy security, either in the short term or long term and makes no economic sense”.\nGreens have challenged the legality of up to £17bn worth of ‘back door’ government subsidies to EDF, the company planning to build Hinkley C; a deal currently being investigated by the European Commission to see if it constitutes illegal State Aid [1].\nGreens also point to a similar reactor being built in Finland, which is now expected to be almost a decade late and well over budget [2]. They say that similar delays to Hinkley C would totally undermine one of the key arguments the government uses to justify its nuclear programme: that nuclear is urgently needed to fill the energy gap and ‘keep the lights on’.\nFinally, Greens highlight a report from giant multinational investment bank, UBS, which concludes that the proposed £16 billion Hinkley Point C nuclear power station could be obsolete with 10 to 20 years [3]. The report says large power stations will soon become extinct because they are inflexible, and are “not relevant” for future electricity generation. The bank urges investors to “join the [solar] revolution”.\nMolly Scott Cato concluded, “This really is a case of three strikes and you’re out”.\nThe Green Party reaffirmed its opposition to nuclear power at its autumn conference in Birmingham at the weekend.\nNotes\nSee Stop Hinkley website: http://stophinkley.org/StopPress.htm\n[1] http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/dec/02/european-commission-inquiry-hinkley-point-deal\n[2] http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/01/finland-nuclear-olkiluoto-idUSL5N0R20CV20140901",

The authors, Victor Anderson and Rupert Read from the Green House Think Tank, conclude that a radical shift in economic policy, which reduces dependency on exports and makes the UK more self-sufficient, is the only chance there is of making Brexit successful. All other models of trade – such as falling back on WTO rules or new trade deals outside the single market – would lead to a worsening economy and threaten environmental standards and workers’ rights, says the report.\nCommenting on the report which she commissioned, Bristol’s Green MEP, Molly Scott Cato said:\n“I believe above all else the vote to leave the EU was an expression of a loss of control over our lives and a rejection of politicians who have failed to challenge corporate power or the negative consequences of globalisation.\n“This report is about reinterpreting Brexit in the light of our longstanding Green critique of globalisation. Greens have always argued for greater self-reliance and stronger local economies. It now looks like such a path will be the best future on offer for the UK outside the EU.\n“The recommendations offer some exciting ideas on how we can begin to think our way out of the destructive globalisation of recent years. They offer the prospect of building stronger communities, creating new jobs through re-skilling or learning new skills and reducing our environmental impact. It is a vision of hope in a world dominated by corporate globalisation.”\nVictor Anderson, the lead writer of the report, said:\n“Our proposals aim to build resilience in local, regional and national economies while reducing vulnerability in an increasingly unstable world economy. It is also a challenge to the power of multinational corporations over our economy and people’s lives. The emphasis would be on increased self-sufficiency which would also seek to reduce transport costs, with their associated carbon emissions, while maintaining high environmental standards.”\nRupert Read, a core member of Green House, said:\n“Our report is written on the assumption that Brexit will happen but that there is the potential to turn it from being a disaster for the UK into being the constructive start of a radical new approach to the very real problems of globalisation. We believe this report will prove useful as a basis for a critique of Government policy as it negotiates Brexit over the coming months and years and as a rallying call for changing that policy.”",

For years – as a councillor and before I was elected – I have been campaigning for policies that work towards appropriate and affordable housing for everyone. This includes housing built and maintained to high environmental standards (for the sake of our bills and for preventing climate change), introducing rent controls, and regulating landlords.\n“There is still a long way to go, but landlord licensing is a very important tool for protecting the rights of tenants. It will bring up the standard of rented properties across the city. And importantly, permitting local authorities to inspect privately-rented property as a matter of course will protect tenants from the revenge evictions that too-often follow when tenants make complaints.\n“If you are or have been a private tenant in a shared house, or are the parent, sibling or friend of someone who is (that’s most of us!), please take a few minutes to respond to this consultation supporting the proposal.”\nBackground\n– Councillor Denyer has been campaigning on this issue for a while. For example, this press release from August 2016.\n– Licensing places conditions on the landlord/agent to ensure that minimum property standards are met and that good management practice is delivered.

Mr Hall launched the pledge today outside Ashley Down School in Bristol, where air pollution is known to breach legal limits.\nThe pledge comes as public concern over the health risks posed by air pollution mount and the issue remains high up the political agenda. The impacts of air pollution are known to be particularly severe for babies and young children; air pollution restricts lung growth and can therefore have life-long impacts. The crisis is so severe in some areas that health professionals have advised parents to cover buggies, and some schools are choosing to keep children indoors rather than let them play outside. Darren Hall said:\n“For too long the Government has ignored this invisible killer, hoping the public won’t notice the effects. But research shows more people in Bristol are dying as a direct result of toxic air than they are in road traffic accidents, with the health impacts of air pollution costing the NHS millions.\n“Monitoring will allow us to identify poor air quality hotspots and this is a key element of a wider Green Party strategy to tackle air quality and congestion, which includes the implementation of Clean Air Zones for Bristol and Bath and an Integrated Transport Authority across the region.\n“We have to confront this public health crisis head on. We must restrict large diesel vehicles from the roads near our homes and schools and create the right environment and incentives so that more people use public transport or cycle and walk.”\nMolly Scott Cato MEP, Green Party parliamentary candidate for Bristol West, and Cllr Eleanor Comley, leader of Bristol City Council Green group, will join Darren Hall outside Ashley Down school to speak to parents and hear their concerns about air pollution.\nDr Scott Cato recently took the government to task over their attempts to use the general election as a reason for delaying publishing an action plan to tackle the air quality crisis [1], something they had been ordered to do by the European Commission and a court case involving Environmental lawyers from ClientEarth. She said:\n“That it has needed the European Commission and ClientEarth to drag the government through the courts to account for a public health crisis is a shameful indictment of the Conservatives’ irresponsible and deadly apathy. The government readily acknowledges that any positive air quality action it has been forced to take has been driven by EU law. But the Prime Minister’s plans for an extreme Brexit puts those vital EU safeguards at risk. This is why the Green Party is demanding a Clean Air Act to ensure that the government cannot avoid its moral and environmental responsibilities to tackle our toxic air.”\nThe High Court ruled against the government last week when it attempted to delay publishing plans for tackling air pollution [2].

She has raised the alarm as JP Morgan, the Wall Street bank, announces that 16,000 jobs – including 4,000 in Bournemouth – are at risk as a result of Brexit [1]. Dr Scott Cato, who is an economist and visited JP Morgan in Bournemouth earlier this year, believes the announcement confirms that the South West should brace itself for a post-Brexit exodus [2] of those employed in finance and related sectors. She said:\n“The South West has at least 75,000 finance related jobs and the sector is especially important to Bournemouth, Swindon and Bristol [3]. A combination of push and pull factors could see a meltdown of the sector in the South West and across the UK.\n“JP Morgan have highlighted that deep uncertainty over the impacts of Brexit is encouraging many firms to move jobs abroad, with the EU happy to welcome them; while EU regulations may force many roles to be shifted to the near continent anyway.\n“Leaving the EU was meant to be about taking back control. It’s clear that in reality we are rapidly losing control. An ideological obsession with achieving a hard Brexit by Brexiteers in the Tory government is leading our economy over a cliff edge.”\nDr Scott Cato has repeated her call for a ratification referendum on the final Brexit deal, with the option of remaining in the EU. She said:\n“It is becoming clearer by the day that the hard Brexit being pushed by the Tories; one that involves leaving the Single Market and Customs Union, will be economic suicide for the UK.

The leak of 11.5 million files from the database of Mossack Fonseca, the world’s fourth largest offshore law firm, highlighted the key role played by the UK and its Overseas Territories in the Caribbean and Bermuda in the offshore financial sector.\nThe revelations implicated senior Conservative politicians and their families, including the Home Secretary, Amber Rudd [4], who was previously director of two asset-management companies based in the Bahamas and David Cameron’s father who had a network of offshore investment funds [5]. Molly Scott Cato MEP is a member of the delegation visiting London this week. She said:\n“British overseas territories and other ex-colonial territories were at the heart of the Panama papers and with senior Conservative politicians implicated it is paramount that Britain’s tax arrangements continue to be properly scrutinized.\n“This visit to London to quiz representatives from some of the key authorities concerned with tax avoidance takes place at a key juncture in the UK’s political history. We must do everything we can to tear down the walls of secrecy and encourage a spirit of openness.”\nThe visit by the pan-European delegation takes place at a time when Theresa May and chancellor Philip Hammond have both indicated that the UK could usher in a so called ‘new economic model’ based on low taxes if the European Union do not agree a favourable Brexit deal with the UK [6].\n“As the EU explores ways to clamp down on tax dodging, Theresa May has set her sights on a low tax economy. This will only strengthen the arm of those in the UK and the Overseas territories who help wealthy elites and corporations dodge paying their fair share of tax; money we all need to help create a fairer and more equal society.”\nDr Scott Cato has recently launched a petition on the government’s petition site calling for a halt in the race to the bottom on corporation tax [7]. The petition calls on the UK government to work cooperatively with EU partners on harmonising corporate tax rates across Europe and ensuring the main rate of UK corporation tax is returned to a minimum of 28%. She said:\n“The government has no mandate to turn the UK into a tax haven post Brexit. Rather than threatening a race to the bottom on corporate tax rates, the government should instead be seeking to work cooperatively with our European partners to create a level playing field on tax.”\nMolly Scott Cato has also renewed a call for increased funding for HMRC [8], one of the organisations the delegation will visit on Friday. She said:\n“The cuts to HMRC staff in recent years shows a government going soft on tax avoidance and evasion. If the government were serious about maximizing tax revenue they would realise that cutting HMRC staff is a false economy.

It was their ideology that led to the loss of 1 million well-paid public sector jobs, and now their Brexit threatens to increase poverty and inequality by reducing regional aid.\nClarke is wrong that no politicians have ideas on how to address inequality though. I can only assume he has never read a Green party manifesto.

Having met Azerbaijani political prisoners like Leyla Yunus I know how important it is for the international community to shine a light on these human rights violations. Right now, Azerbaijani activists are telling anyone who will listen that people are increasingly frightened as the number of arrests and reported cases of physical abuse have continued to increase in the last few weeks.\n“This week the LGBT charity Stonewall reported cases of beatings, verbal abuse, forced medical examinations and of trans women having their heads forcibly shaved. This is deplorable. Today I stand in solidarity with all those who understand that love is a human right, that the state has no role in policing a person’s sexuality and that such violence and disregard for human rights is never an acceptable response. Equally, I reiterate civil society’s call on the British Foreign Minister, Boris Johnson, to urge the Azerbaijani authorities to immediately end the reported human rights abuses against the LGBT community.”\nAzerbaijan is notorious for its poor treatment of LGBT people and has been ranked the worst country in Europe for LGBT rights violations.",

Some Green amendments were taken on, as the Mayor signalled a U-turn on his opposition to Residents Parking Schemes and agreed to reverse cuts to union support, but overall the Greens felt they could not support the budget, which cuts jobs whilst holding £10m more in council reserves than is required.\nThe budget proposes cuts of £33m in total over the next few years, more than required to close Bristol’s budget gap of £19.5m. Cuts of over £5m to the councils workforce were condemned by the Council’s trade unions, who submitted statements to the meeting warning of the impact on staff and key services of staffing cuts and outsourcing. (see notes below)\nGreen Group Leader Heather Mack said:\n“Since the first budget meeting two weeks ago, Greens have tried to work with the administration on a budget we could support. There are some positives in the revised budget passed tonight – thanks to work by the Greens it’s a better deal for the city than it was at first. We’ve managed to ensure that union support will be protected, as will disabled parking bays. With our amendments we’ve protected 30 mins parking for small businesses, doubled funding for school streets projects, and found money for new residents parking schemes.”\n“However, there remain serious concerns with this budget which required collaborative working from early on to address. Instead of working with us on reducing cuts and delivering public toilets, Bristol’s Labour Mayor chose to work with Conservatives to pass his cuts budget. I believe it is fundamentally wrong to make deep cuts to services like those in this budget while also adding millions to the Council’s reserves – and so while Greens have made a difference to this budget, most of us do not feel able to support it in its current form.”\nIn total the following changes have been made due to the Greens’ influence on the budget:\nGreen amendments which were agreed by a majority of councillors in the first meeting – to allocate £4m to parks and liveable neighbourhoods, and to pay for new public toilets – were rejected by the Labour Mayor, as was an amendment from the Knowle Community Party to support the community transfer of Jubilee Pool. In negotiations following the meeting, the Labour Mayor instead adopted Conservative amendments to fund parks work in the North of Bristol and repair Kingsweston Iron bridge in order to secure the support of the Conservative group for his budget.\nSpeaking at the meeting, the Green Group’s Deputy Leader Lisa Stone called out the Labour Mayor’s collaboration with Conservatives, adding that voters in Bristol should know “in the future when you vote red, you’ll be getting blue”.\nShe said:\n“Confusingly, the Mayor has taken some amendments that were voted through and left others out, a bit like a referee on a football pitch, accepting goals they like the look of and disallowing those they do not – Tottenham could have done with a ref like that last night!”\nCouncillor Martin Fodor added:\n“This isn’t a cross party budget, it’s a backroom deal budget where a Labour Tory coalition seeks to bypass the actual representation across the city. The city deserves better than this. Next time there must be a more inclusive and democratic process.”\nGreen Councillors argued that the deep cuts in the Mayor’s budget, coupled with the administration’s refusal to take on democratically adopted budget amendments from the first budget meeting, meant they could not support the administration’s budget, and a majority of the group abstained on the final budget vote.\nHeather Mack said:\n“By refusing to work with other parties on the Council’s budget, Labour are depriving Bristol of practical and sensible ideas to tackle our city’s problems. This should not happen again – if the Labour administration wants to deliver a sound and progressive budget for Bristol they have a duty to work with other parties in advance. In a committee system people from all parties and from across the city would have worked on the budget in advance and developed a budget that is good for the whole of Bristol.”\nNotes\nNotable statements submitted to the meeting:\nAll statements are available online at https://democracy.bristol.gov.uk/documents/b30042/Public%20Forum%20republish%20-%20Statements%20received%20at%2015th%20Feb%20first%20budget%20meeting%2002nd-Mar-2022%2014.00%20.pdf?T=9\nIt is unacceptable to reduce frontline staffing levels, only to expect them to continue to meet the same targets/service provision when staffing levels have been radically reduced.\n“There is not a need to transfer these staff out of BCC and we are asking you to instruct BCC officers to take this seriously and investigate this possibility. Members have made the significant point that they worked hands on throughout the pandemic, and now they are being treated like this. They are upset and angry and deserve a lot better.”\n“our overriding concerns are that the full impact of what is being proposed have been ‘hidden’ from public scrutiny…the anticipated level of reduction we are told is 5x more than expressed publicly.”\n“we estimate at the very least 8 – 10 people being made redundant but the real number will likely to be considerably more and possibly double. Our staffing levels will literally be decimated, as will the service we provide.”\nE.g. Statement PS16 from Rachel Legg:\n“ACORN members and the people of Bristol rely on our public toilets for our basic dignity at work, in our leisure time or travelling around our city. They are essential for those of us with disabilities, those with bowel and bladder conditions, those of us without a home, and the elderly. We deserve a city that we can live and work in, without fear of the indignity of being caught short.

Personally, I am dubious to their intentions as they took absolutely no role in the very inclusive community consultation and the resulting community vision which was put out to developers over the last few years. It is my firm belief that this development must benefit the wider community of Stokes Croft, St Pauls, Montpelier and Cotham.”\nRob Telford, Green councillor for Ashley and vice-chair of the Development Control A Committee added:\n“Fifth Capital have shown in the past few months how they are completely unable to command the community’s trust. A straightforward answer to numerous questions about their links to the current site owners, the Comer brothers, has not been forthcoming. We are disappointed that they have chosen to disrupt an already lengthy Compulsory Purchase Order (CPO) process which has a named preferred developer –Knightstone Housing.”\nThe public meeting will be held on Monday 13thOctober at 6pm at the Salvation Army Citadel, Ashley Road.

The tax could raise £250 billion a year globally, with some of the money being used to support council services that have been decimated by government cuts. Another advantage of an FTT is that it helps reduce the number of risky financial transactions, the gambling which helped to trigger the financial crisis.\nThe Green Party is urging people to take an easy action by writing to their local councillors asking them to pass a motion supporting the FTT [2]. Almost 40 councils have passed such a motion with Plymouth being the first in the South West. Greens want to see other councils follow suit.\nIn Bristol, Green Party councillor Rob Telford, asked Mayor George Ferguson at a recent Bristol City Council Cabinet meeting to support the FTT. The Mayor responded by saying he did not regard this as a high priority [3]. The Green Party in Bristol is urging people to contact the Mayor asking him to reconsider [4].\nProfessor Molly Scott Cato, who is the Green Party’s finance spokesperson and lead South West European candidate said:\n“The Green group in the European Parliament has been instrumental in pushing for a FTT. Eleven Member States including Germany, France, Italy and Spain have decided to put people before the profits of their big banks and financial speculators and introduce an FTT [5]. The UK government on the other hand has continued to block the tax in order to protect their friends in the City.”\nDr Scott Cato is also lead councillor of the Green Party Group on Stroud District Council. She concluded:\n“I will be proposing a motion of support for an FTT in February. I want our council and other councils across the South West and beyond to send a clear message to the government that Robin Hood wants finance to work for the common good, not the vested interests of the few!”\nNotes\n[1] Further information on the Financial Transaction Tax from the Robin Hood campaign: http://bit.ly/JRWsfB\n[2] Use this link: http://bit.ly/13HBown to ask local councillors to back a Robin Hood Tax.

  "https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_/https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_meps-launches-report-with-radical-ideas-for-agriculture-postbrexit/content_694.html": "menu\n* Direct payments based on land area to be scrapped with payments retargeted towards rewarding farmers for providing public benefits\n* Farmers to receive payments for safeguarding and improving the environment\n* Focus on meeting UK demands for food instead of putting export markets first\n* Introduce VAT on meat products\n* Ban the routine preventative use of antibiotics\nBristol’s MEP, Molly Scott Cato, who is also a member of the European Parliament’s Agriculture Committee, has today launched two reports on ideas for the future of farming post-Brexit.\nThe reports are launched as it becomes clear the government lacks a vision for the future of agriculture [1]. One report is by the Soil Association, the well-known food and farming charity; the other by Simon Fairlie of the Land Workers’ Alliance.\nBoth reports foresee a future where policies put soil health and biodiversity first, and where the way we use land helps tackle climate change. They agree that to achieve this, farmers will need to receive at least as much money as they currently get through the Common Agriculture Policy (CAP). However, they say direct payments based on land area should be scrapped and retargeted at paying farmers for the public benefits they provide. They also call for additional funding for advice, training, and farmer-led research and innovation.\nOther more radical ideas from Simon Fairlie include a shift away from export markets so UK farmers can focus on meeting UK demands for food; 20% VAT on processed meat products, and ‘polluter pays’ labelling on food products which involve the use of artificial fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides and GM materials. Meanwhile the Soil Association calls for a new national agroforestry strategy, a ban on the routine preventative use of antibiotics, and using procurement to drive demand for locally produced, especially organic, food.\nMolly said:\n“We have a government that is not only clueless on how to improve the lot of our farmers and food producers, but is also chasing damaging trade deals with the US and Canada which would weaken the higher EU standards that have shaped UK agriculture over the last 40 years.\n“The absence of any plan for our food and farming sectors is even more alarming given the extreme form of Brexit that Theresa May’s government is pushing for. Around 65% of total UK agricultural exports go to the EU, while around 70% of the UK’s imports originate from other EU countries. Removing us from the single market risks punitive tariffs on exports and imports, while an end to free movement would make it impossible to take on the seasonal migrant labour from EU countries so crucial to many farms.\n“Yet Brexit could be a unique opportunity to move towards an ecologically sustainable farming system; one that focuses on supporting family farms and relocalising food production, thereby creating thriving rural communities. We can also refocus land management to encourage biodiversity, improve animal welfare and help tackle climate change.\n“These two reports do something that the government seem incapable of doing – providing a wealth of exciting and innovative ideas for policy makers, farmers, food producers and rural communities. But ultimately what happens to farming will affect us all as it will shape the future of our economic, social, environmental and physical landscapes”.\nDr Tom MacMillan, Director of Innovation at the Soil Association, said:\n“We’re hearing a fair bit of consensus from farming, nature and public interest groups on the big principles for agricultural policy after we leave the CAP – that the public expect high standards on animal welfare, for example, and that public money should pay for public benefits. What’s missing are practical and inspiring ideas that seize the chance to make a better fist of it, and face up to monumental challenges like climate change. So we’ve tried to set out a few game-changing ideas in our report”.\nFurther information about the two reports.\n[1] Response to Parliamentary Question 63096 asked by Caroline Lucas MP:\nThe Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has provided the following answer to your written parliamentary question (63096):\nQuestion:\nTo ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, what research the Government has commissioned in the last six months to inform the development of agricultural and environmental policy once the UK leaves the EU. (63096)\nTabled on: 06 February 2017\nAnswer from George Eustice:\nDefra invests a significant amount in agricultural and environmental research to underpin policy development and implementation. Much of this is relevant to the development of future policy in the context of EU exit.\nHowever, research specifically to inform agricultural and environmental policy once the UK leaves the EU, which is distinct from the department’s on-going research programmes, has not been commissioned in the last 6 months.\nThe answer was submitted on 09 Feb 2017 at 17:54.",

At the meeting there were over 120 statements against airport expansion, including a statement from MEDACT Bristol representing over 100 local doctors opposed to the expansion.\nDuring the meeting Mayor attempted to argue the Airport expansion was not his decision to take but as a major stakeholder the Mayor and Bristol Council have influence in their views on the matter. Other councils and council leaders in the region have come out against the expansion of the Airport (e.g. Weston Council).\nThe Green motion was proposed by Green Councillor Steve Clarke, who also asked Mayor Rees about his position on airport expansion during Members Forum at the beginning of the meeting. In response the Mayor said “my position is that Bristol Airport should be allowed to expand in a context of increasing global passenger numbers”.\nResponding outside the meeting to the Mayor’s answer, Cllr Clarke said:\n“The Mayor is happy to ’talk the talk’ on climate change but he seems to be trying once again to ignore the biggest carbon decision in the region; the proposed expansion of Bristol Airport. The extra carbon produced by the expansion alone will be almost as much as the whole emissions of Bristol.”\n“This is a Climate Emergency and the people in Bristol have a right to ask for leadership and action on climate change rather than excuses. Over 4000 individuals and most of the nearby communities have formally objected; he should follow their example at once.”\nLeader of the Green Group, councillor Eleanor Combley said:\n“The Council has accepted there’s a Climate Emergency but when push comes to shove the Mayor sides with the airport’s shareholders instead of local people and the planet. This is exactly what environmental campaigners like Greta Thunberg mean when they accuse politicians of ‘empty words’ on climate change.”\nReacting to the events in the Council meeting, Councillor Clarke added:\n“It’s a disgrace that councillors voted against the extra time needed to debate this crucial issue, particularly as this could be our last chance before the key vote at North Somerset Council. Blocking climate action is what I’ve come to expect from the Tories but it’s depressing to see Labour councillors line up alongside them to block Green action yet again and take the side of big polluters over people and the planet.”",
  "https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_/https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_news_bristol-uni-fossil-free/content_316.html": "menu\nThe University of Bristol, after extensive talks, announced today that it will withdraw all £1.2m of its investment from the fossil fuel industry. Moving from partial to full divestment is a big step forward for the university, with plans being put in place to ditch all fossil fuel companies from its investment portfolio over the next couple of years.\nBristol is the 10th Russell Group university and 62nd UK university to fully divest from the fossil fuel industry, following in the footsteps of Edinburgh last month. The People & Planet-led Fossil Free campaign has held an active society in Bristol since 2014, and had already achieved huge success – last year, the university pledged to divest from all companies who derived more than 5% of their revenue from the fossil fuel industry by 2018, bringing investments down considerably. The University of Bristol could also become the first Russell Group university to complete the process of full divestment, with officials projecting that this could potentially be achieved by 2020.\nRobert Kerse, Finance Director for the university, said “We’ve made a commitment to completely withdraw our investment from companies which support the fossil fuel industry by March 2020. It’s an ambitious timescale but we realise the importance of swift action to combat climate change.”\nThe 2017 agreement also promised the investment of £3 million in a ‘green’ fund, as well as a ‘material reduction’ in investments in coal and tar sands. However, this was small fry for the university’s Fossil Free society. Since September 2017, they have made it clear that nothing but full divestment would be acceptable to the students of Bristol.\nPapatya O’Reilly, Fossil Free society president, said ‘It fills me with pride to know that our University is playing its part in the Fossil Free movement. So many institutions have divested now that it has become mainstream, yet its impact is undeniable. Divesting is a powerful way of showing solidarity with frontline communities, whose exposure to fossil fuels takes its daily toll on their crops, health, and liberty. Now, we call on all other Universities to follow Bristol’s lead. Join us in preventing climate destruction, in moving our economics and culture towards a sustainable future, and in ensuring a just transition for those bearing the brunt.’ Papatya will be graduating with an undergraduate degree in English and Philosophy this year, and will go on to work as a Trustee for People & Planet.\nGreen Councillor Carla Denyer, who first tabled a motion calling for divestment to the university’s advisory body, the University of Bristol Court, back in 2015 said:\n“After years of campaign work from students, staff, politicians and alumni it’s fantastic to see a real commitment to full divestment from Bristol University. It just goes to show the impact that ordinary people can have through acting together and keeping up the pressure on big institutions.”\n“I am proud to live in a city where, because of the hard campaign work of so many people, both our Council and the University of Bristol have committed to fossil fuel divestment. Following this success, Green Councillors will also continue to focus on increasing the pressure on the Avon Pension Fund to follow suit and commit to full divestment too.”\nThe move to full divestment from the university administration came as something of a surprise; up until recently, Bristol held the position that it would be capable of having influence over the inner workings of energy companies as shareholders – in other words, the financial department seemed to think it would be able to persuade such companies to invest in green energy from the inside. However, following action taken by Bristol students representing the Fossil Free movement, this position was understood to be untenable.\nPeople & Planet’s Fossil Free Campaigns Coordinator, Chris Saltmarsh, said ‘Bristol’s full divestment after a powerful student campaign is another hammer blow to the fossil fuel industry haemorrhaging its social license to operate. 2018 has already seen Huddersfield, Sussex, Edinburgh, Anglia Ruskin, Durham and Cardiff divest millions from this terminally declining rogue industry. It’s time for our banks like Barclays and the UK Government to take our students’ and universities’ lead and exile fossil fuels from our economic and political life.”\nThis latest university divestment is proof of an ever-growing divestment movement throughout the UK, and an approaching end to the suffocating fossil fuel industry.",

Greens have consistently argued against classifying large scale biomass as a clean and carbon-neutral energy source and have called instead for investment in genuine renewable sources such as solar wind and tidal energy.\nMolly said:\n“Small scale biomass which uses sustainable wastes or locally coppiced wood has its place in a renewable energy mix. But the harvesting of timber on an industrial scale and shipping it across the Atlantic cannot be considered either sustainable or carbon neutral.\n“The real scandal here though is that the use of wood pellets on this scale has come about because of a government prejudiced against domestic renewables. Since I became an MEP, there have been two major off-shore wind farms dropped: Navitus Bay in Dorset and the Atlantic Array off the North Devon coast. Combined, these could have generated enough electricity for over a million and a half homes. And then there have been huge cuts to solar subsidies, and planning regulations that make onshore wind farm development virtually impossible, it is clear we have a government that has an ideological opposition to clean green renewable power.\n“The South West could be a green beacon to the rest of the country, showing how it is possible to produce in excess of 100% of our energy needs from renewables. We have the resources, the people, the skills and the ambition to make this happen. All that is missing is the political will.”",

The call comes on the same day that the Conservative Party have launched their manifesto, which promises to ‘reduce immigration to tens of thousands’ [2]. The UK government has always made clear that Britain will play no part in assisting other countries by offering safe haven [3]. Molly Scott Cato said:\n“The European Parliament has today sent a strong signal saying that EU countries must relocate refugees. The Conservative government’s repeated refusal to play any part in the relocation of refugees currently living in crowded and squalid conditions in southern Europe adds to the perception in continental Europe that the UK is risking its status as a civilised society.\n“Today’s manifesto launch confirms that the Tories have abandoned any commitment to rational policy-making when it comes to immigration. Their decision to bear down on immigrants from outside the EU will make the UK an insular country where compassion towards refugees and asylum seekers in desperate need is sacrificed at the altar of mythical statistical targets.\n“We need to build bridges not walls. But it is clear that a Tory government will choose the latter, closing the UK’s borders and in doing so turn us into Europe’s meanest nation.”\nNotes\n[2] http://www.itv.com/news/2017-05-18/conservative-party-manifesto/",
  "https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_/https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_an-eye-opening-talk-by-george-monbiot/content_905.html": "He talked of the current government subverting the democratic process by sneaking in laws that undo hard-won environmental legislation such as the Climate Change Act; subsidising shot gun licenses to the tune of £17 million a year to the taxpayer; capping of welfare benefits while in the same month preventing an EU imposed cap on subsidies given to wealthy land-owners. But far from being simply a list of gripes about a corrupt government, they represented a far greater problem: what he called a ‘socially constructed silence’. This is the idea that political discourse has such a narrow focus, often defined and constrained by vested interests, that huge issues are left in the shadows. Legislation that is accepted by politicians and the media – and therefore society – slips through the democtaric process as unquestionable truths that do not warrant discussion. As a result, journalists who highlight these issues are seen as marginal and political parties who confront them, radical. Monbiot saw these issues as ‘open goals’ that the opposition, the Labour Party may inherit. For the Green Party, however, fighting these injustices is fundamental to our values.\nMonbiot also talked about the enormous intrinsic value that being in wild places has on children. He is engaged in occasional outdoor education and this has provided a fascinating insight that really struck a chord: in each class of inner city school children he encounters there is always one child who shines out as the brightest and most engaged. However, according to their teacher, that child is invariably an underachiever or troublemaker in the classroom. Taken out of the rigid, structured environment of a school building and into a wild place these children discover an enthusiasm for learning and inquisitiveness they would never have known within the confines of the current curriculum. How many of these youngsters will go back to Hackney or Peckham and within a few months forget about their experience and never realise their potential value to society? How many will be failed by a schooling system obsessed with exams and league tables? The sad truth is that most of theses children will grow up thinking of themselves as failures. The Green Party believes in a child-centred approach to learning which builds on the skills and interests of each individual child and instills in every child a love for the natural world that will produce a generation that values and fights for the environment.\nFinally, during the Q&A session, Bristol West candidate Darren Hall had the chance to question Monbiot on how he thought members of the audience (and individuals in the wider society) could contribute to a positive green movement and in particular redefining the nature of the debate and questions in the media. In his answer George made reference to the Scottish Independence referendum, where there was a record turnout in voting and young people engaged in a passionate way with politics. To do this we all need to make use of social media – which Monbiot claimed to be a more important medium than newspapers and television – and word of mouth in galvanising real support for causes we believe in. We should be focusing on glass-half-full, positive politics to counter the fear and hate-mongering dialogue coming from the emerging far-right.\nIt was heartening to hear such an intellectual heavyweight talking passionately about issues that are fundamental to the green party’s ideology. All in all it was an eye-opening, interesting and inspiring, especially as George was unequivocal in his support for the vision and values of the Green Party. He even gave his own personal endorsement of Darren.",

At a Full Council meeting this evening (11 December) a majority of Councillors supported a motion tabled by Green Councillor Fi Hance, which calls on the Mayor to lobby the UK government and work with MPs and other councils to push for a change in immigration law and alternatives to detention.\nCommenting on the successful vote, Councillor Hance said:\n“I’m delighted that this motion has been passed and am proud that Bristol is joining a growing number of cities, such as Manchester, Brighton, and Liverpool, in telling the government that the indefinite detention of immigrants and asylum seekers is unjust and unacceptable. I hope the Mayor will help us take this campaign to the government and demand reform of this cruel and inhumane policy as soon as possible.”\nDavid Ion from the campaign group ‘These Walls Must Fall’ said:\n“By passing this motion the city council have shown that they are as committed as the people of Bristol are to ending immigration detention. This is a great victory for our campaign and will mean Bristol will play a leading role in the ongoing fight against our country’s most shameful institution. Thank you to all those councillors who showed their support.”\nToday’s motion opposing immigration detention did not pass without controversy. Despite cross party support from Green, Labour and Lib Dem Councillors, Conservative councillors attempted to water down the motion, putting forward an alternative amended version.\nGreen Councillor Fi Hance said:\n“I was deeply disappointed by the approach from Conservative Councillors who tried to undermine this motion which calls for the basic rights of immigrants and asylum seekers to be upheld and for people to be treated humanely. Thankfully, the Conservatives do not have enough councillors in Bristol to sabotage the vote, but it is disturbing that the party which currently runs our country is not prepared to oppose the cruel treatment of those who have done nothing wrong.”\nCurrently in the UK approximately 30,000 people are detained in immigration detention every year, having committed no criminal offence, but for lacking the correct immigration papers or pending administration of their case. Detention is at centres in prison-like conditions, with no time limit on how long people might be held – detainees do not know whether they will be held for weeks, months or years. The UK is the only country in Europe to detain people indefinitely in this way, at a cost to the government over £100 million per year.\nBristol now joins the growing number of cities across the country demanding an end to immigration detention.\nNotes\n– Immigration detention recently hit headlines in Bristol when Kenneth Macharia, a gay rugby player for local team Bristol Bisons, was detained and threatened with deportation.

Greens had submitted the same motion at a previous council meeting in July where it was also not heard due to lack of time. The motion called on the Mayor to lobby the government to set up an All-Party Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry for Truth & Reparatory Justice which would discuss reparations for the trafficking and enslavement in African people.\nSpeaking about the decision, Councillor Lake said:\n“The other councillor groups may not see this as an important issue but for many residents in their city it is. There were over 130 statements and questions in support of the motion – for many people today was the first time they had ever attended or submitted a question or statement to a Council meeting. They will be disappointed that it has been blocked from being discussed today.”\nCouncillor Lake added that she was especially disappointed as she had tried to work with Labour on the motion well in advance of the meeting. She said:\n“I reached out to Labour well ahead of tonight’s meeting because I hoped they might accept our motion – I know some Labour politicians genuinely support this cause, and Islington and Lambeth councils have recently passed joint Green-Labour motions on this issue. And I was led to believe Labour would work with us on it.

The decision comes after campaigning by local residents and months of campaigning by the local Green Party about the illegal and unsafe levels of air pollution in the city. The opposition to the proposed diesel power plant, which was to be built just a few hundred meters from a primary school, was a key component to the campaigns.\nJon Eccles, a local Green Party campaigner who lives close to the planned site in Lawrence Hill welcomed the decision saying,\n“This is a great result for Bristol and especially for the people of Lawrence Hill. We are already suffering from the emissions from all the traffic passing through east Bristol to the city centre. Residents’ health would have been further affected by the generators themselves and the extra diesel lorries that would have been necessary.\nHe continued,\nThe company behind the scheme, Plutus, are not an energy company but an investment vehicle. They have no interest in our community, their only interest is to tap into government subsidies. We are proud in Lawrence Hill to be the home of some pioneering community energy projects that produce clean, affordable, and safe energy.”\nCllr Clive Stevens who spoke against the proposed power plants both welcomed the decision and the strong community campaign but warned against any complacency. In his statement to Development Control Committee B, he said,\n“The inspector’s report said that the Council made an error by not considering the health of people working nearby, especially anyone working in the early evening. The air pollution would then be over the legal limits for them. Therefore, that meant extra information was needed, for example why these particular diesel engines are supposedly so much better than others and about the applicant’s intention regarding other trials or use of other equipment to further reduce NOx levels. Unfortunately, this judgment leaves it open for anyone to reapply once they can provide the necessary information.”\nGreens continue to highlight that the grounds for accepting or rejecting such plans are set by government, not by the council or community.\nCllr Clive Stevens explains,\n“It is against the rules to consider a development’s effect on global warming. There is also no mention in the inspector’s report of the development’s impact on inequality on Bristol, a major theme in the mayor’s campaign to be elected. This is something, as Greens, we will continue to challenge at every step”.",

You can read about it in this article in the Bristol Post, which features the Green Group’s response.\nGreen councillors ensured there was proper scrutiny of the plan before publication and made a number of key suggestions, however on publication they were disappointed to find that none of these changes seem to have been made.\nCouncillor Lily Fitzgibbon, our co-Shadow Cabinet member on Climate and the Ecology, (pictured on right) had this to say on the Labour administration’s announcement, which was released to the press and not shared with councillors beforehand.\n“This is a step in the right direction. But for an Emergency Action Plan, there’s not much of a sense of this being an emergency response. When these proposals came to scrutiny, Green Councillors on the committee called for a sense of urgency, more practical actions the council could take, and a ‘baseline’ report of the state of Bristol’s ecology in order to measure future progress. It appears none of these proposals have been taken on board.\n“While there are plenty of goals in the plan – which is important – there is little in the way of practical action to achieve these. Those steps that are proposed are often quite weak and have a long timescale. For example a target is set for nine years to reduce pesticide usage in Bristol, but it’s already five years since the Mayor pledged to do just this in his 2016 manifesto, and the council continue to spray controversial pesticides such as glyphosate around the city.\n“Furthermore, the Labour administration still supports the expansion of Bristol Airport, with its car park on Green belt land, and is progressing steps to develop on the city’s green spaces, such as the Western Slopes. As with the Climate Emergency declared in 2018, it’s what you do after declaring an emergency that counts.

This will include actively campaigning to change the voting system so that the make-up of parliament and other elected assemblies more accurately reflects the voting patterns of the UK electorate.\n(3) A commitment by Mr Jones to regular meetings with Bristol Green Party representatives during his term of office to discuss issues that are of particular concern to the Green Party. These include: improving air quality, increasing the levels of social rent housing, developing renewable energy schemes, expanding energy efficiency programmes, protecting the environment, and reducing inequalities.\nIn return for the above agreed commitments, the Green Party candidate Sharmila Bousa will step down from campaigning in Bristol North West.

Everyone talks about the need for affordable housing and the 10,000 people on the council’s housing list and the numbers of people sleeping rough are evidence of the problems. Bristol’s own Mayor Marvin Rees pledged to build 800 a year for example, but for this to be possible we need an urgent change in how our housing system works. At the moment it is all too easy for developers to fail to deliver the council’s own affordable housing target of 30%-40% by saying that if they build affordable homes their scheme won’t make enough profit. The viability process – on which these decisions are made has been too secretive and should be entirely public. This motion will help to make that happen.”\nThe Green Party have called for half a million homes to be available for social rent by 2020 across the country. This would cost £27 billion over the course of the parliament which could be paid for by increasing Government spending on social housing by £4.5 billion a year and removing the cap on what local authorities can borrow to build new housing. Increased government spending would be paid for by scrapping mortgage interest tax allowance (worth around £5.8 billion a year) and reforming other landlord tax allowances.\nCouncillor Clive Stevens who also spoke said:\n“It is clear the affordable housing system doesn’t work, even the planning officers say its broken. I agree with them. Some of the change needed is national but there is much we can do in Bristol with good leadership and targeted effort. If asked, I’d love to help get the affordable housing process working again and if it needs banging a few heads together then I’m up for that”\nThe leader of the Green group Councillor Charlie Bolton said\n“I am pleased that this motion has passed, despite opposition from Conservative councillors, and hope that we can really have some action on affordable housing.

Other Labour-led cities have produced their plans and are now eligible for the government support on offer to get on with improving their air pollution. Yet in Bristol all we see is inaction. Lives are being blighted by ill health and early death and families who suffer the most and have the lowest car ownership are those who suffer most.”\nGreens point out that it is over eight hundred days since Bristol City Council unanimously supported a Green Party motion in favour of a Clean Air zone. In that time some 700 people have had their life shortened as a result of poor air quality.",

The majority have been parents who are worried about their children playing on or near areas which have recently been sprayed. But lots of other residents, from community food champions to foragers and gardeners, have also expressed their concerns.’ said Councillor Hoyt.\nEarlier this year an agency of the World Health Organisation found that Glyphosate, which is found in most herbicides including the weedkiller RoundUp, is ‘probably carcinogenic to humans’. Green Councillors have already raised concerns with the Mayor, asking for more detailed information on how and where glyphosate is used across the city.\n‘I’m sure Monsanto – with their vast economic interest in products like RoundUp – will fight claims that their product could cause cancer. Paris and the State of California have already decided to use the precautionary principle and ban the chemical after its safety was called into question. There are many safe alternatives to glyphosate-based weedkillers – many used here in the UK. I’m simply asking the Mayor to start with a trial of these more acceptable methods and compounds on the geographical area of Ashley ward. I’m a councillor for this small but important area of the city and would like the Council and its contractors to do best for the people I represent.’\nWhen asked if all glyphosate use should be banned Cllr Hoyt replied that in some instances the experts agree on its effectiveness. ‘There are highly invasive weeds, such as Japanese knotweed, where it may be possible to argue that the use of glyphosate is necessary, but these are exceptional cases. I hope that a glyphosate free trial in Ashley would demonstrate that the alternatives to glyphosate which are used in other places could be applied to Bristol.’\nImage © Flickr/Michelle Tribe",

Since then there has been a growing campaign across the city on the issue, including a 140ft long divestment mural, which was put up on the M32 as new students arrived at the university to raise awareness of the issue.\nGreen Councillor Carla Denyer, who is hoping that this year her motion will be passed by the University of Bristol Court said:\n“The prospect of catastrophic climate change is so terrifying, and will so unfairly impact on those who are the least to blame for causing it. Yet it is also so complicated to solve that I often feel powerless. But here, the University has a rare opportunity to exert a small amount of power, to prevent or lessen the effects of climate change. By pulling investment from fossil fuel companies, the University can say to the world that in the 21st century, investing in climate change is just not OK.”\n“Bristol University is now lagging behind. A quarter of UK universities have now committed to divest. Worldwide, the divestment campaign has seen leading institutions pledge to phase out fossil fuels from portfolios totalling $3.4 trillion, up from $2.6 trillion just 12 months ago. Meanwhile, according to research by The Bristol Cable, Bristol University’s investment in fossil fuels has shockingly increased over the last year. In 2015 I asked the University to show leadership – this year I am just asking them to keep up.”\nProfessor Chris McMahon, an Engineering lecturer at the University, who wrote an open letter to the Vice Chancellor last year calling for divestment, signed by over 50 members of staff, said,\n“A number of my colleagues in the University are leading members of the worldwide scientific community that has clearly established that it is imperative that we reduce our carbon emissions as a matter of urgency.”\n“Many universities and other bodies throughout the world have recognised that the moral case for divestment is clear and compelling. Although this is a time of deep uncertainty about the future I believe that divestment from fossil fuels and investment in renewable energies (in which many organisations in the city of Bristol are showing leadership) is also recognised as the economically and politically wise thing to do. I hope that the University will show such wisdom and real leadership and move quickly to a decision to divest from fossil fuels”\nPaloma Parkes, one of the students from the Fossil Free University of Bristol campaign, explained:\n“After the appointment by Donald Trump of a climate change denier to be in charge or the Environmental Protection Agency, the need for action on climate change is more urgent than ever. Campaigns need to redouble their efforts and universities need to invest their money in line with their principles and understanding of science”\nReverend Ed Davis, Anglican Chaplain for the University of Bristol, and one of the members of Court who co-signed the motion, added,\n“Many students and staff are committed to developing a more sustainable future, and will be pleased to see this priority embedded within the new University Strategy. Ensuring that its investments are consistent with sustainability will therefore be a natural step in helping the University become the kind of institution it aspires to be.”",

  "https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_/https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_action-needed-for-bristol-to-be-carbon-neutral-by-2030/content_149.html": "menu\nBristol’s Green Councillors have today launched a new report outlining the action needed for Bristol to meet its new commitment to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. In November, Bristol’s Councillors from all parties supported a Green Party motion to announce a climate emergency and pledge to make Bristol carbon neutral by 2030, the most ambitious target of all UK core cities. Bristol’s Mayor was tasked with developing an action plan within six months to respond to the emergency, and the new Green report outlines the first steps Bristol City Council needs to take to develop meaningful action.\nBristol’s climate pledge follows the recent announcement from the IPCC that humanity has just 12 years to take emergency action to prevent global warming greater than 1.5°C. Sir David Attenborough called the emergency the greatest threat in thousands of years, warning that inaction will lead to the collapse of civilisation and the extinction of much of the natural world.\nThe leader of the Green councillor group Eleanor Combley said:\n“We have just 12 years to avoid catastrophic climate change by limiting global warming to below 1.5°C. I have teenage children now, and by the time they are in their twenties, it will be too late. The scientists have done their job by telling us of the risks of floods, droughts and extreme heat and the increase in poverty, conflict and migration this will cause. Now it’s time for our politicians to respond. History will not judge inaction kindly. I’m proud that Bristol’s councillors from all parties have come together to vote for Bristol to have the most ambitious climate change targets of all the UK core cities. We now need these promises to be turned into action, and our Change Starts Now report outlines the decisive action needed.”\nGreen Party Mayoral candidate Sandy Hore-Ruthven said:\n“Becoming carbon neutral is a real opportunity not only to reduce our environmental impact but to create jobs, improve our transport and our homes. It’s good for everyone in Bristol especially those who need the most help. Reducing emissions from transport will make it easier for everyone to get around the city. Greener homes are cheaper to run – saving the poorest much-needed money on fuel bills. Generating that energy from renewable sources creates more jobs than traditional energy generation.”\nDeputy Leader of the Green Party Amelia Womack said:\n“It’s great to see Bristol setting the gold standard on climate action. While the Government fails to act on the climate crisis, our communities and cities are stepping up and showing real leadership – because they know that the consequences of failing to act are immeasurable. And they are doing so despite the desperate austerity measures imposed by the Government.”\nCouncillor Eleanor Combley continued:\n“Our Change Starts Now report showcases some of the inspiring action cities across the country and the world are taking to respond to the climate emergency, as well as the extensive work already being done across Bristol. We know Bristol has the expertise and drive to succeed in becoming carbon neutral by 2030. We now look forward to hearing the Mayor’s formal announcement of the climate emergency and his endorsement of the 2030 commitment, followed by an implementation plan due in May.”\nFull report here>>\nImage: Dean Shim",
  "https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_/https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_labour-wasting-council-time-with-attacks-and-selfcongratulatory-cheerleading/content_325.html": "menu\nAt a Bristol Full Council meeting today, Green councillors criticised the Labour group for wasting Councillors time pushing a self-congratulatory motion, and tabled an amendment to the motion which would have committed all councillors to protect valuable Council services in forthcoming budget – however the Labour group joined the Conservatives in voting this amendment down.\nCouncil meetings take place just 10 times per year and are valuable opportunities for local politicians to debate and influence local policy, partly through putting motions to the meeting. For example previous motions brought by the Green group have committed Bristol to a 2030 target for carbon neutrality, forced a vote on the Temple Meads Arena, and launched council work towards implementing Clean Air Zone. Last year Labour amended the rules so that the number of motions they are allowed to propose for debate doubled, while the opportunities for every other party halved.\nDuring the debate the Labour motion was criticised by councillors from all opposition parties who characterised it as “pointless” and argued it contained little of substance other than praising the administration.\nSpeaking on the motion, Green Councillor Charlie Bolton said:\n“The motion tells us how Labour brought forward a progressive budget last year. This was the one with £30million plus of cuts.\n“Next time I see someone sleeping rough, I can say to them, ‘don’t worry, you may be homeless, but Bristol Labour passed a progressive budget’. People of Bristol – this is not a pot hole. It’s a progressive Labour Party pot hole. Public toilets closed? Fear not – Labour Bristol are taking the progressive pee.\n“I could go on, but frankly, why bother. We could all turn Bristol into a version of Trumpsville. We could spend the next 16 months coming up with this sort of drivel – back and forth, back and forth. Alternatively, we could actually take a step back. I know Labour can be better than this – can’t we collectively agree to actually try to raise the level of debate slightly higher than this nonsense?”\nGreen councillors tabled an amendment to the motion which removed preamble text celebrating the Mayor and would have committed the administration to “protecting support for the most vulnerable through the Council Tax Reduction Scheme and Local Crisis and Prevention Fund, and standing up for local services” – however this was voted down by Labour and Conservative councillors.\nGroup leader Eleanor Combley said: “Why are Labour wasting the Council’s time with self-congratulatory cheerleading when, as we saw from the petitions at this meeting on dangerous pesticides, saving Hamilton House and the future of the Bear Pit, there are so many issues that Bristolians would rather see a vote and decision on.\n“Opportunities for parties to debate motions at council meetings like this are few and far between and it’s a shame that Labour sought to use theirs to pat themselves on the back rather than addressing any of the issues facing Bristol today. In fact the whole meeting, including Member Forum questions, was dominated by tribal and partisan politics from a Labour administration repeatedly attacking the Greens, including for not voting for Labour’s austerity budget last year, which contained £5m in cuts to Special Education Needs support later ruled as illegal by the High Court.\n“Labour know full well we are opposed to austerity. They like to talk about working together but then behave like this. This is not leadership. You can’t bully people into wanting to support and work with you by constant sniping, point scoring and stretching the truth to breaking point.”\n– Full text of Green amendment with tracked changes is attached here.",
  "https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_/https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_refuse-come-clean/content_315.html": "menu\nGreen councillors have said they are concerned and frustrated that Bristol’s Labour Mayor refused to answer questions at yesterday’s Full Council meeting about the controversial pay-off of the Council’s ex-chief executive. A report into the severance package found that there was a lack of transparency over the £196,000 pay-off provided. The Mayor refused to answer questions from councillors and the public on why the administration chose to pay the full pay-off and why the payment decision did not go to the HR committee unlike other payments to departing senior officers.\nGreen Councillor Paula O’Rourke, who has been raising her concerns about the situation for many months said:\n“We need to know why the Mayor misled the people of Bristol. He told us that he had to make this payment, that it was entirely contractual, but we now know this was not the case. And why was it not brought to the Council’s HR committee as it should have been? Even now there are so many unanswered questions. Despite promises of transparency councillors and the public have only been allowed to see a small part of the report into what actually happened. Why won’t the Mayor give us straight answers?”\nAt last night’s council meeting, members received the auditor’s report into the payments made to the ex-chief executive and learnt that half the money received was a discretionary payment. This contradicts the Mayor’s previous assertions that he had to make the payment as it was ‘contractual’. The report also criticised the ‘lack of transparency’ in the process.\nCouncillor Fi Hance said:\n“It beggars belief that the Mayor expects us to believe that someone who left the Council’s employment without working their notice was contractually entitled to nearly 200k severance payment. It’s possible that the lack of Council policy meant it wasn’t illegal, but surely it doesn’t make it right.”\nCouncillor O’Rourke continued:\n“I am saddened that the Mayor chose to spend the whole of the debate hiding behind half-truths and refusing to take responsibility for mistakes made. It was left to other members of his Labour group to do the responsible thing by accepting that mistakes were made and assuring us that lessons would be learnt. It would have been so much more fitting if we had heard these from the Mayor himself. It does not give me faith that the other concerns around HR matters that we have been raising in the Council will be looked into properly.”\n“I feel that this is an affront to the people of Bristol who want to be told the truth about how tax-payers money has been spent, not half-truths and smoke screens. I am also concerned that we have only been allowed to see a quarter of the report and that at the heart of the report there is a ‘truth vacuum’ because the individuals closely involved in the decision were not interviewed about what happened. ”",

Cllr Radice says the Greens strongly oppose the £83 million in cuts, handed to Bristol by the Coalition Government, which will impact vulnerable citizens and services for all of Bristol:\n“Cuts in recent years have removed layers of community infrastructure. The £83 million reduction we face now is an out and out attack on the poorest members of the community. But this is only the beginning. Both George Osborne and Ed Balls have committed to continue local cut backs and reduce central government funding to Bristol. This, combined with increasing demands on social care, will see an end to local choice on almost all service spend by 2020. In effect, this is systematically abolishing local democracy by stealth. Bristol needs to make some brave decisions to raise money and become more economically self-sustaining.”\nThe Greens also pledged to vote against the tabled Liberal Democrat amendment to freeze council tax: “Freezing council tax is complete economic illiteracy in the current situation and will only leave Bristol in an even worse state in years to come,” said Gus Hoyt, Green party cabinet member. “Had the council passed the Green amendment to moderately raise council tax two years ago we would be £6 million better off now.”\nGreens are calling on George Ferguson to do more on the national level to fight back against Central Government control: “The 2% cap on council tax rises, imposed by coalition, undermines local democracy. George Ferguson, and Bristol’s four MPs, must insist for our local right to make decisions about how we raise income. The expectation that you can have Scandinavian-style public services with American-style taxation is a myth,” said Cllr Rob Telford.\nThe Green Party aim to see a radical change to the way local government is financed. Currently approximately 80% of local government finance comes from central government, the rest is raised locally. The Greens would like power to be decentralised so more finance is under local control, as is the case in almost every other European country.\nOn a national level, the Green Party offers a radically different set of economic ideas, insisting that we cannot ignore the massive inequalities in our society or the health of the planet, when formulating economic policy. The Greens would establish a national living wage, implement the citizen?s income, invest in Green infrastructure to create jobs and build economies based on renewable energy, make a clear separation between casino banking and personal banking, ensure public ownership of finance, support for local currencies, and revise tax banding to make sure those who can pay more, and those who can’t pay less.\nAt the budget meeting on Tuesday, Green councillors will all vote on the mayor’s budget. The Green Party does not operate a whip system and councillors are free to make up their own minds as to which way they will vote.\nNotes\n1. Daniella Radice is available for interview.\n2.

In Summer 2017 the Council requested funding and was provided with over half a million pounds to carry out the necessary work – since then a feasibility study was set up to explore various options for a Clean Air Zone in the city.\nEnvironment minister Therese Coffey has written a letter to the Mayor stating that the Government gave Bristol Council the required support and funding to ensure it could meet the deadlines and said she was “absolutely astonished at [the Mayor’s] delay in improving air quality for the people of Bristol as quickly as possible.”\nCllr Jerome Thomas, deputy leader of the Bristol Green councillors said:\n“Greens first passed the Council motion to commit Bristol to take action on air pollution back in 2016. Over two years later it seems the Labour administration is scarcely any closer to dealing with our city’s toxic air – to the extent that the Government is now considering legal action against the council for failing to meet its legal requirement to set out plans by the required deadline. Meanwhile, the lives of over 300 Bristolians are cut short by toxic air each year.\n“I was willing to give the Mayor the benefit of the doubt for a long time, but I have to say it is beginning to look like these delays are due to either a lack of interest in prioritising clean air for Bristol or deliberate interference with the feasibility study that was commissioned to find a solution. This study is supposed to be impartial, yet the Mayor’s political views are clear from repeated statements implying he is opposed to options that charge polluting vehicles – despite this likely being the most effective way to protect the health of Bristolians. The question needs to be asked, is the Mayor letting politics get in the way of cleaning up our poisonous air? Children in our city currently inhale the equivalent of two cigarettes a day in toxic air.”\nSandy Hore-Ruthven, Bristol Green candidate for Mayor, said:\n“If Bristol City Council fails in its legal duty to comply, this is a serious failure to the people of Bristol and its environment. The Mayor must provide an explanation for these delays and prioritise producing a plan for Bristol and then implement it. Whether the Mayor has been deliberately stalling while Bristol chokes or simply failing to pay attention to the clean air crisis in our city, it is frankly outrageous to continue neglecting the health and lives of Bristolians – particularly those in the most deprived areas of the city, where there are very low rates of car ownership but as many as 10% of deaths are attributable to air pollution.”",

In a speech today, Jeremy Corbyn said he is not wedded to freedom of movement as a matter of principle, while Deputy leader, Tom Watson has called for tighter immigration controls as part of any Brexit deal. Meanwhile, former leadership contestant Owen Smith, has said it was right to be pro-immigration, even if it meant losing votes.\nMolly, who is the parliamentary candidate for Bristol West and the Green Party spokesperson on EU relations, said:\n“The bewildering array of views on free movement within Labour reveals how deeply divided the Party is. With eyes fixed squarely on the forthcoming by-election in Copeland, and on its northern heartlands, Labour is adopting different messages to different audiences. Just like the Conservatives, Labour have no clear Brexit plan and simply cannot be trusted.\n“Corbyn’s support for freedom of movement for goods but not people is an attempt to have your cake and eat it. But such an approach, adopted by both Tories and Labour, resembles a mad hatter’s tea party; it’s farcical nonsense.\n“From where I am sitting in the European Parliament, it is clear that other EU members will never accept a pick-and-mix approach. Labour are pandering to those who have a prejudice against the free movement of people and this will force the UK out of the single market. It is astonishing that Labour are unwilling to defend the terms of membership of this market on which thousands of jobs and livelihoods depend and which offers protections for both workers and consumers.\n“There is a place for a discussion on free movement but that place is inside the EU. Such discussions over whether there should be an adjustment to this principle are already taking place. But for the sake of safeguarding the essential principles of the EU, changes will need to be agreed by all EU countries.”\nMolly says that the Green Party stands united in defence of the principle of freedom of movement:\n“As Greens, we will work hard to defend the rights of all people wherever in the EU they live or choose to live.

Politicians and the public are increasingly looking on with horror at what is happening in Yemen with British arms. We are appalled that the UK government would turn a blind eye to this in order to put profit before basic principles. There is a growing human cost to the conflict in Yemen and history will judge this government poorly if they drag their feet in suspending the sale of arms to Saudi Arabia. They can and they must act now.”\nKeith Taylor, MEP for the South East, added:\n“While the EU is pushing to curb arms sales to Saudi Arabi, the UK Defence Secretary is telling politicians ‘it’s unhelpful’ to keep highlighting the regime’s war crimes and human rights’ abuses because it might damage our ability to sell deadly weapons to as many dangerous dictators as possible. It cannot be right that the UK Government is only concerned with the profit margins of arms dealers and not the real and harrowing cost of the human suffering they are facilitating. It is unforgivable.”\nJean Lambert, MEP for London, concluded:\n“It’s horrifying that the UK Defence Secretary would ask elected representatives not to criticise his dodgy deals with Saudi Arabia so he can secure yet another fighter jet deal. Perhaps he hasn’t noticed the 2.5 million people who have lost their homes in Yemen as a result of this weaponry?

This time last year I came to London, and met with Caroline Lucas MP and deputy Leader of the Green Party, Amelia Womack. Together, we lobbied the Treasury to end austerity and “to urgently provide local councils with the money they so clearly need to protect services and restore spending on community and frontline services to sustainable levels.” A year on, cuts to local government are continuing, despite your declaration in October that “austerity is over”. As a result, Bristol’s Labour administration has just voted through a budget which takes millions from both adult social care and children and families services.\nCouncils are being hit by a triple whammy of cuts to core funding, to public health funding and to the schools budget.\nAccording to the cross-party Local Government Association, between 2010 and 2020, councils will have lost 60p out of every £1 the Government had provided for services. The Government has cut Bristol City Council’s core funding by hundreds of millions of pounds since 2010. Despite our early adoption of business rates retention, we are increasingly reliant on increases to council tax which, despite our campaign to protect a fully-Funded Council Tax Reduction scheme, is a regressive tax which hits the poorest hardest. I would urge you to consider fairer alternatives such as a Land Value Tax, which you find laid out in more detail in Green Party Policy.\nAt the same time, public health funding has been under relentless attack, with the Health Foundation estimating that there has been a real-terms cut of £900m in public health between 2014-15 and 2019-20 and that the core public health grant has fallen by a quarter per person since 2014-15. Bristol already has shocking and entrenched differences in life expectancy and healthy life expectancy between richer and poorer areas of the city: still as wide as sixteen to seventeen years of life in good health. Public health work is an essential tool to change that, by addressing both the wider determinants of health and specific causes of avoidable death such as smoking.\nThis year’s announcement on schools revenue funding will do nothing to alleviate the enormous pressure on school budgets, which the Institute of Fiscal Studies (IFS) says have declined by 8% in England since 2010. Bristol is a city with shocking educational inequalities, with less than one in ten young people in some areas going on to higher education, compared to 100 per cent in others. Shrinking school budgets will only serve to increase inequality as schools in more affluent areas have more opportunities to fundraise or collect parental donations to try to mitigate the effect of cuts.\nTo tackle inequalities in health, education and opportunity, as well as to meet the urgent and vital need for action on Clean Air and on the Climate Emergency, Bristol needs fair funding, together with more local powers. I look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience what you plan to do.\nYours sincerely,\nCouncillor Eleanor Combley\nLeader of the Green Group on Bristol City Council",

In a leaflet delivered to every household in Cabot by Young SouthWest Greens, Ani urges residents to sign Residence’s e-petition[1].\nThe collective of theatre makers, performers, and live artists, have held the tenancy at 11 St Nicholas Street since 2009. Under the Council’s now defunct Capacity scheme, Residence benefitted from a peppercorn rent. A success story for the kind of Council investment in cultural regeneration Greens support, Residence can now afford to pay the market rate.\nBut Residence have been advised that several commercial businesses have put in above-market rate bids for the tenancy, and that the decision is likely to be made on financial value alone. Residence have no alternative venue, and Ani fears a vital piece of Bristol’s independent cultural scene will be lost. The decision on the tenancy is due to be made this Friday.\nAn open letter to Bristol [2] has been published on Residence’s website, with signatures including the Director of Mayor George Ferguson’s Tobacco Factory; Guardian theatre critic Lyn Gardner; and senior figures from various local and national cultural institutions.\nAni Stafford-Townsend, Green Party candidate for Cabot Ward, said,\n“if commercial retailers can afford to bid over the market value, then they can afford a tenancy elsewhere. Residence will struggle to find an alternative venue that meets their operational needs. There is a big issue here about how the Council uses its landlord status to best support groups like Residence. Every £1 spent in the arts generates £4 for the economy, so supporting Residence is economically sensible too.”\nElla Good, Artist and member of Residence, said,\n“Residence want to take on the lease at the rate that the council has advertised the property for – we’re not asking for a freebie or a hand out. We believe the council should take into account Residence’s six year history of managing and maintaining 11 St Nicholas Street. We’ve created an artistic hub which has made a huge contribution to the cultural reputation of Bristol. Losing the building means the livelihoods of the seventeen artists who work from there will all be put at risk“\nCharlie Bolton, Leader of Council Green Group, said,\n“This would be a great loss for Bristol’s vibrant cultural scene. It also raises serious questions about how the Council uses its landlord status to decide on tenancies. Simply going with the highest bidder prevents local residents from shaping their own communities. I call on Officers to look at Residence’s track record as a tenant; their reputation locally, regionally, and nationally; and allow them to remain. As a Council, we need to ensure that these decisions aren’t made purely financially. Bristol is a community run for residents, not a corporation run for shareholders”\nNotes:\nAni Stafford-Townsend is the Green Party candidate for Cabot Ward in May 2015’s local elections.\nCharlie Bolton is the Leader of the Green Group on Bristol City Council.\nResidence is a community interest company, a group of 17 artists who all make performance in one form or another.

And so based on what we’ve heard and the strength of feeling that this has generated across the city, the Greens will not be supporting any proposals put forward to move to four-weekly collections at this time.”\n“The full results of the consultation will be presented to a cross-party group to decide on any changes to our waste and recycling services.\n“I would like to thank everyone who made the time to make their voice heard. The Greens aim to be as collaborative and transparent in our decision making as possible. While other parties consult on pre-made decisions, the views of Bristol will always be taken into account under this administration.”\nThe Greens have previously pledged to increase Bristol’s recycling rate. They have said that Bristol’s recycling rate started to decrease under the previous administration and is now at about 45%. This needs to increase to 65% by 2035 to be in line with the Government’s ‘Resource and Waste Strategy’.\nOn top of this, the Greens have said that disposing of Bristol’s waste costs the city money, and recycling makes money to go back into public services.\nIn a blog on the council website, Deputy Leader of the Council Heather Mack said that in 2024, the recycling collected by Bristol waste earned the city £4.5 million in revenue, while disposing of it would have cost the city £8.3 million to process.\nCllr James Crawford, who also sits on the Environment and Sustainability committee, said, “There are many changes that we need to make as a city to improve our recycling rate. Larger recycling containers, better information on recycling, more consistent facilities and services in blocks and shared dwellings, and collection of soft plastic recycling are all things we can do.\n“I look forward to seeing the full results of the consultation and working cross-party on what measures we can take to improve recycling for Bristol.”\nNotes to editors:\nCllr Martin Fodor is the Chair of the Environment and Sustainability Committee\nMore about Martin",
  "https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_/https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_news_green-councillor-raises-concerns-over-council-collaboration-with-home-office-to-target-migrants/content_456.html": "menu\nMigrants, mostly from the European Economic Area (EEA), make up a significant percentage of privately renting tenants in Bristol. Many struggle with high and increasing rents as well as sub-standard living conditions, and due to their often precarious living circumstances may be reluctant to come forward to report problems or seek support, which can also lead to homelessness. Green Councillor Cleo Lake has raised concerns at new funding received by Bristol City Council which she fears could be used to further marginalise vulnerable and homeless migrants, betraying Bristol’s status as a ‘Sanctuary City’.\n£180,000 from the Government’s Controlling Migration Fund is going to the City Council to address migration (which includes people coming from the EEA) as well as a further sum of over £300,000, ostensibly to focus on rogue landlords. This will be done through a scheme where migrants are encouraged to report inadequate living conditions – but in doing so may then face deportation.\nThrough this fund not only will immigrant rough sleepers be supported to ‘accept offers of reconnection’ to their native lands, but the Home Office will also fund random raids of properties based on citizen ‘tip offs’ to deport immigrants under the guise of outlawing rogue landlords. To quote the BCC website:\n“The officers will work with partners including Avon and Somerset Police and Immigration Compliance Enforcement (ICE) to identify properties where there are likely to be high levels of exploitation and trafficking. Officers will carry out proactive inspections of these premises, using our powers of entry to gain access to all dwellings.…It is estimated that approximately 1,200 inspections will be undertaken over the two year period, equivalent to approximately 312 streets being covered across the city.”\nCleo Lake, Green party councillor for Cotham, posed a question at Cabinet on August 15th concerning the number of immigrant rough sleepers, requesting a breakdown of:\n– Place of origin\n– Immigration status and outcome\n– How many people were been brought off the street through the City Initiative\nCouncillor Lake says the follow up answer she eventually received gave her cause for concern:\n“EEA rough sleepers seen regularly by Bristol Outreach are ineligible to access supported pathways off the streets. Without realistic potential to find or sustain work e.g. because of substance misuse, many in time will accept an offer of reconnection. Once a client consents, it is more efficient to employ our written protocol with the Home Office to facilitate voluntary administrative removals. This joined-up approach provides the Home Office with valuable intelligence about potential returnees…. funding also provides for a full-time Bristol City Council Streetwise Officer specifically to:\n• build a stronger intelligence picture of migrant rough sleeping\n• liaise with ICE and Police to target detention of individuals subject to enforced removal\n• liaise with Outreach around supportive interventions/voluntary reconnection”\nCommenting on the response, Councillor Lake said:\n“The data given suggests that the vast majority of rough sleepers are UK citizens. Out of a recorded 295, 148 were recorded as ‘white British’, 8 as ‘Black’ or ‘Black British: African’ and 97 were ‘Origin Unknown’. The information goes on to suggest that there will be a target of “64 reconnections per year (total for enforced/voluntary administrative removals, voluntary reconnections), pro rata for first year.\n“Human trafficking and exploitation is extremely concerning and must be confronted, along with rogue landlords which the information suggests go hand in hand with this exploitation. It is only right to target rogue landlords – they are a blight on our community and should be challenged across the board. However homeless people are, by the very nature of their being, extremely vulnerable, and should have our unconditional support.\n“Whilst I do not condone illegal migration I am minded to also reflect on the reasons that people risk their lives and often put themselves into severe debt to come to the UK. Whether it’s to seek asylum, opportunity or to join family, Bristol is supposed to be a City of Sanctuary but it seems to me that there is a danger of a lack of separation between vital support and immigration enforcement which could jeopardise that City status. Support for homeless migrants or those living in substandard accommodation cannot come with the threat of deportation or we risk further marginalising some of the most vulnerable people in society. I hope that positives do come out of this but I will be watching closely to see what is really happening.”\nNB: Bristol was officially recognised as a City of Sanctuary in 2011 – for more information see https://bristol.cityofsanctuary.org/",

Green Councillor Paula O’Rourke and Labour Deputy Mayor Asher Craig are leading the ground-breaking new approach of using citizens’ assemblies to help Bristol emerge from lockdown.\nCouncillor Paula O’Rourke, who proposed the idea in a motion to Full Council in January said:\n“Our democracy has never been more in need of a reboot and here in Bristol we are pioneering a new approach. Real democracy is about so much more than just turning out to vote every few years. If we want to build back better from the coronavirus pandemic we must all be involved in how our city recovers.”\n“We want to see people from across our city involved in making the decisions that affect their lives, which is why Greens have been campaigning for citizens’ assemblies. A citizens’ assembly will be made up of a mixed group of people picked at random, similar to jury service.”\n“The representative sample of about 100 people of all ages, backgrounds, ethnicity and social class come together to discuss the most challenging issues we face in Bristol. They will receive a stipend towards the costs of their work and have access to top experts in the area they are debating to help them produce their recommendations for the city’s recovery.”\nCouncillor Asher Craig, Deputy Mayor for Communities and Equalities, who amended the Full Council motion in January on behalf of Mayor Marvin Rees’ administration, said:\n“The health and economic impacts of the pandemic have fallen unequally and often hardest on people who already face disadvantage. While the lockdown restrictions have presented citizens with major change and disruption, this has also given people new perspectives on what the future could look like.”\n“For far too long the social, racial and economic inequalities that exist in our city have drowned out the voices of the most disadvantaged. We need to break this endless cycle, and ensure that nobody is left behind.”\n“The conversations we have started, where everybody is heard, are a crucial step in how we will rebuild a better Bristol. This is a real opportunity for citizens to help propel forward plans to deliver a fairer, healthier and truly sustainable city.”\nNotes\nCovid-19 has caused disruption to the lives and livelihoods of people across Bristol. The first citizens’ assembly will look at the city’s recovery and the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to rethink what kind of future we want for Bristol. The new approach follows a motion taken to Full Council, proposed by Green Councillor Paula O’Rourke and strengthened by an amendment (pages 5-9) from Labour Councillor Asher Craig, calling for citizens’ assemblies to be used to reboot democracy in Bristol.\nAhead of the first citizens’ assembly, due to take place in the autumn, the Council has put out a survey called ‘Your City, Our Future‘ to all residents in Bristol. The results of this survey will decide what the citizen’s assembly will focus on. The results will show what changes most citizens agree on and which are more complex so need more discussion by a citizens assembly. The survey aims to reach 5000 citizens to provide crucial input from as many people as possible across Bristol.",

Commenting on the launch of the Brexit Syndicate website, Molly Scott Cato said:\n“These shady organisations who drove the campaign to leave the EU, wasted no time in organising to gain the maximum advantage for themselves and their causes in the wake of the Brexit vote. From privatisation and co-option of national governments, they have moved on to writing the rules of global capitalism in favour of the 1%. In doing so, they plan to use trade treaties to eliminate the standards and protections politicians have fought for over the past four decades, subverting the democratic process to ensure it works for the few, rather than the many.”\nThe European Research Group (ERG), headed up by Jacob Rees-Mogg, is one of the groups featured on the website. Others include the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA), the Initiative for Free Trade [6] and far-right media outlets, as well as various tabloid newspapers.\nDr Scott Cato said:\n“Rees-Mogg accuses the EU or behaving like the Mafia in its negotiations with the UK. But as we expose in this website, it is actually the Brexit side that is driven by a secretive cabal of powerful and interconnected organisations.\n“The ERG is just one of a host of extremist organisations who are exercising extraordinary influence over government policy and who are seeking to manipulate our political system to their own advantage and to the detriment of the vast majority of UK citizens.”",

I am deeply concerned by the impact that cuts to frontline services will have on those who rely on them. I’m scared by how this will affect our communities and how we work together as a city. I am also sad for the many valuable council staff who, after a lifetime of working to provide services for the people of Bristol, are being told that they no longer have jobs.\nMostly though I am angry that the people we represent are being abandoned because of a political choice in Westminster. Bristolians are being forced to pay more Council Tax for less services, and there’s a simple reason – Government is brutally slashing its grants to local authorities, by 75% by 2020. The Government have chosen a path to intentionally dismantle our public services. They could be closing tax loopholes, reforming our finance system, bringing good growth to our economy or increasing tax for the top 1%. But they are choosing not to, they chose to bail out the banks and spend billions on defence projects like Trident, and pay for it by taking from the most vulnerable. So let’s be clear, the blame for these cuts should fall squarely on the shoulders of this Conservative Government.\nEvery time a library closes, a homeless person no longer has a safe place to sleep or a local bus route vanishes, we must remember that these cuts are not inevitable, they are a choice that our Government has made. They have chosen to take books from our children instead of asking the richest in our country to contribute a fraction more.\nWe must remember this next time we go to the ballot box. We live in a democracy, albeit an imperfect one, and we can and we must demand change. It is not enough to bury our heads in the sand as the services that keep our communities together crumble around us. Until then, if we want change we are going to have to build it ourselves by campaigning for an end to austerity, a proportional voting system where our votes will count and proper investment in our public services.\nOur Mayor, Marvin Rees, says he can still deliver on his commitments despite these cuts. I am doubtful but hope I am proven wrong. At the moment though this promise looks unlikely to be fulfilled. Despite promising to protect children’s services, his latest budget includes £1,500,000 of cuts to ‘re-shape children’s services’. Despite Labour campaigning to oppose any closure of libraries last year, their own budget this year now accepts libraries will have to close and, by the Mayor’s own admission, these cuts will harm the lives of the most disadvantaged that he spent his election campaign promising to work for.\nWe know that these cuts are not what Labour want to be implementing, so it’s time to stand up and say no. We need proper opposition to the Tory cuts, from Labour and all opposition parties across the country, not merely a massaging of ever-smaller budgets to create the least bad option.”",

The most recent polling 10 days ago in the Bristol West constituency puts the Green Party within touching distance of winning the seat. The poll shows that the election is between the Green Party and Labour, with the Liberal Democrats trailing in third place.\nIndependent onlookers keep remarking on how many Green Party posters there are up throughout the whole of Bristol West constituency, easily more than any other party. You only have to look around you as you walk or ride about in the constituency to see the truth of this, to see the huge number of Vote Green Party posters everywhere. So it seems clear that the level of support for the Greens is very high. Labour keep trying to say that it is between them and the Liberal Democrats, trying to pretend that the Greens don’t exist, because the Labour Party knows full well that when people see the reality, that the Liberal Democrats are trailing in third place in the latest poll, that there are more Green Party posters in windows than any other party, and that the Greens therefore have a very good chance of winning, it would badly damage Labour’s chances in Bristol West. Labour knows only too well, and fears, that more people than ever will be likely to vote Green when they know that the Greens really can win!\nAs well as the Bristol West parliamentary seat, the Green Party is also on course on Thursday to win new council seats across the city, expecting to make several further gains on Bristol City Council.",

They also convincingly kept an 8th seat in Ashley which they already held. Together with the 6 seats they already hold, this means that the Greens now have 13 seats on the city council.\nFor the Greens, together with the Green Party’s fantastic second place with 27% of the vote in the general election in Bristol West, Thursday night’s local election results represent a sea change in Green Party support and representation in Bristol. With their 13 seats, the Greens have 3 seats more than the Liberal Democrats, and are now the third largest party on Bristol city council.\nThe Greens’ 17,227 votes in the general election in the Bristol West constituency means they are also now the main challenger to the Labour Party to win the parliamentary seat in the future, having beaten former Liberal Democrat MP Stephen Williams into third place by well over 5000 votes.\nIn Ashley, Gus Hoyt held his Green seat on the council with an amazing 4470 votes which was 51% of the total vote in the ward. This is possibly the largest number of votes ever received by any councillor for any party in Bristol in a city council election.\nThe Green Party won a landslide in new seat after new seat, as Cabot, Clifton, Clifton East, Cotham, Easton, Southville and Windmill Hill all fell like dominoes in the Green gale.\nIn Easton, Anna McMullen got a massive 47% of the vote in a 1000 vote victory over the Labour Party. It was a similar story in Cotham, where Dani Glazzard got a triumphant 43% of the vote, a clear majority of more than 1400 over the Liberal Democrats, and in Cabot, where Ani Stafford-Townsend won with a 1224 vote majority over Labour, a huge 38% of the vote. In Lawrence Hill, Jude English achieved a great result, coming second to Labour with 28% of the vote in a ward to which we had allocated less resources than others.\nIn South Bristol, the Greens’ Stephen Clarke took the second council seat in Southville, again with 45% of the vote, nearly 1200 votes more than Labour, while Deb Joffe also had a 1000 vote victory over Labour with 40% of the vote in Windmill Hill. Labour also nearly lost Bedminster to the Greens, where, in a great effort, the Green Party’s Alan Baker was only 260 votes away from winning with an excellent 2160 votes, a vote share of over 30%.\nAlthough hoped for, more unexpected were the fantastic Green victories in Clifton and Clifton East. Jerome Ungoed-Thomas took Clifton for the Green Party with a 300 vote victory over the Conservatives and a 33% share of the vote. Last to declare was Clifton East, where our Carla Denyer won with a 260 vote majority over the Conservatives, also nearly a 33% vote share. The Clifton and Clifton East victories were especially sweet because they were victories over the Tories in seats which the Conservatives had expected to win, especially in view of the Liberal Democrats’ decline.\nAll of these excellent results, without exception, were very well deserved, but they were only won because the teams and their members and helpers in every single ward worked incredibly hard for weeks, but especially during the final month of the campaign. We give our heartfelt thanks to everyone who in any way gave of their time, energy and commitment in order to help us win these victories, not forgetting the teams in Bishopston and Redland where there were no council elections.\nFor the Green Party, all these incredible results are a vindication of all that the Greens stand for, of their faith and belief over a long time in Bristol as a city with a huge Green base, but most of all they are a victory and reward for all those Bristol people who went out and actively demonstrated their faith and belief by voting Green on Thursday.

Her work follows successful campaigns by local communities across Bristol to remove billboards in St Werburghs, St Pauls and Christmas Steps, and continuing work by the campaign group Adblock Bristol to oppose new and existing billboards across the city.\nLocal groups including the Christmas Steps Arts Quarter, the St Werburghs Neighbourhood Association and St Pauls Planning Group have in recent years identified numerous billboards in the city that were erected without consent, and have successfully requested that the Council’s planning enforcement team serve notice on the owners to remove them. Inspired by these successes, Councillor Denyer applied for the abandoned and broken billboard in her ward overlooking Whiteladies Road to be removed. This week the Council served a discontinuance notice to the owners. Providing that no appeal is lodged, the billboard will be removed later this year.\nCouncillor Carla Denyer said,\n“I am really pleased that the billboard will be coming down soon, it has been a visual blight on the local area for a long time. Large and ubiquitous advertising hoardings like this are bad enough when well-maintained, let alone when they look like this.”\n“And it’s not just a matter of spoiling the view – advertising is bad for our wellbeing. Advertising frequently uses tactics that make citizens feel that they are not thin, beautiful, rich or powerful enough, pressuring people into buy things they wouldn’t otherwise want or need, and driving excessive consumption. Worse still, research shows that children are particularly susceptible to advertising, with children under seven less able to recognise the “persuasive intent of commercial appeals” – in other words, less able to tell the difference between information and advertising.”\n“So getting this broken billboard removed is a start, but I don’t intend to stop here – Bristol would be a better place without any corporate outdoor advertising. And this is an achievable goal – many cities have already banned such adverts, such as Grenoble in France and São Paulo in Brazil.”\nNicola Round from Adblock Bristol added,\n“There is a growing movement against corporate outdoor advertising in Bristol, a movement which reflects the independent and free-thinking identity of our city and shows that people have had enough of unwanted, unavoidable and manipulative advertising on our streets. We agree that Bristol would be happier and healthier without billboards, and removing abandoned ones like this is a great place to start. We have also recently seen the welcome removal of a billboard on Marlborough Street which was found to not have planning permission. These and other local successes are an inspiration to other communities who are fed up with seeing corporate billboards every day and want ad-free, happier neighbourhoods.”",

This followed recently proposed changes that sparked a huge backlash and included a range of new fees and rules for allotment holders across Bristol.\nGreen Councillor Martin Fodor said, “Allotments serve key functions to communities across Bristol, providing an outdoor space to not only grow food, but for education and community, all of which can improve quality of mental and physical health.\n“Whilst we recognise that fees may need to gradually increase to restore the smooth running of the service for plot holders, the decision from Cabinet to increase rents was deeply flawed. The consultation was a complete muddle, survey results were ignored, key information like the real budget of the service was presented late and totally inadequate, and the equalities impact assessment was not fit for purpose.\n“These proposed shock rent increases are the result of an ill-judged freezing of rents by the Labour administration, which has created a failure to invest in the service for many years. In 2022, the Council agreed an inflationary rent rise of 25% to cover the period 2018-2025, which was never implemented. The administration and Cabinet member with responsibility for Public Health and Communities must also answer why this was never put in place.”\nThere will now be a public meeting of the Call-In Sub-Committee, made up of members from all parties which will take place at 5pm in City Hall on Wednesday 27th March.\nCllr Emma Edwards, Leader of the Green Group on Bristol City council, said, “Until May, Labour has total control of Bristol City Council, despite the Green Group being the largest political party. As opposition councillors, although we are limited with the information we can get and the influence we can have, we have enough information to believe that this decision was in breach of the decision-making process as laid out in the constitution.”\n“When the city finally gets balanced committees representing all parties elected by residents, the Greens will make sure the committees pick up the pieces and start to listen to the concerns, wisdom, and insight of allotment communities.\n“These voices will be central in shaping our strategy to support the service and ensure there is a clear budget to sustain it. Meanwhile we will continue to gather information about what the current administration is doing.\n“Sadly, the furore created by these ill-judged proposals means it will be a more difficult task to ensure a collaborative debate that develops a better way to manage this service.”\nCllr Martin Fodor is the Chair of the Environment and Sustainability Committee\nMore about MartinCllr Emma Edwards is the Leader of the Green Group on Bristol City Council\nMore about Emma",

But Labour have no such allegiance and so it is disappointing to see them taking such a feeble line. The banking catastrophe is not an example of a failing market that can be saved by a little more competition.

These were among a number of items put before the committee on the 28th of November.\nCare experience as a locally protected characteristic\nYoung People 18 or over who have previously been in Care are known as Care Experienced Young People. This demographic are less likely to access higher-education and employment and more likely to experience mental health issues and homelessness. Bristol City Council will now recognise Care Experience as a locally protected characteristic.\nCllr Christine Townsend said “I am proud that Bristol will recognise care experience as a locally protected characteristic. This will give these young people the same protections and considerations as other protected characteristics in law, including access to reasonable work adjustments and positive recruitment action.”\n“This is cross-party work that has been coming through the corporate parenting board for the last several years, and I would like to acknowledge the work of my predecessor in getting us to this point. Moving forward, this is for all officers and members to make sure that this is embedded across all the workings of the council.”\nHome to School Transport Fleet\nThe committee also voted to spend £1.8 million to purchase a fleet of 29 electric vehicles for those children and young eligible for home to school transport.\nThe report to the committee states that bringing these costs in-house has shown to be the best way to control costs in other local authorities. These vehicles will replace 29 high cost routes over the next two years, with savings of up to £720k over the next five years. When not being used for this purpose, they will also be available to deliver savings and benefits across other council departments.\nCllr Ellie Freeman, who sits on the committee, said “Demand for home to school transport has also been increasing year on year, and sourcing this externally means that the council pays a premium. By bringing this in house, the hope is that significant savings are made and that if journeys are completed safely and on schedule, we can expand the fleet.”\n“We will also make sure that the transition causes minimal disruption for the children that rely on this service.”\nBristol Sanctuary Services\nThe committee also got an update on Bristol Sanctuary Services, and approved the council to spend grants from central government (up to a maximum of £7 mil [1]) to deliver cross- cutting support to people seeking sanctuary from a range of immigration backgrounds until March 2027.\nIn September 2024, the Adult Social Care Policy Committee agreed to the proposal to resettle 15 families via the Afghan Citizens Resettlement Scheme (ACRS) and 15 families via the UK Resettlement Scheme (UKRS) until March 2027.[2]\nCllr Christine Townsend said after the meeting, “Protecting our most vulnerable children is one of the most important responsibilities of this council.

Green Party Councillors responded to the news slamming both the Tory austerity agenda and the lack of any real opposition to it.\nGreen Councillors have previously highlighted how Tory cuts to local government will impact on the core services and Green mayoral candidate Tony Dyer highlighted the huge spending gap in Bristol back in May of this year.\nThe spending freeze means that all non-essential spending will be halted. Maintenance of buildings, roads and parks will be stopped unless it poses a risk to health and safety, recruitment of council staff will be halted and no new contracts for goods or services will be approved without CEO approval.\nThe news comes ahead of next week’s Cabinet meeting, where the finance report will outline that despite further cuts, there is still a £27.5m financial gap if the Council is to balance its books for 2016/17 – which are predicted to be reduced to £16m if proposals to cabinet next week are accepted.\nLeader of the Green group on the Council, Charlie Bolton commented:\n“It seems this Tory government has no plan – and possibly even no interest – for how local councils like Bristol are meant to be able to afford even basic services. For example, the crisis in adult social care did not even get a mention in the Autumn Statement. At the same time the local Labour run administration seem to have no coherent plan about how to respond to these challenges. Nationally, Labour have failed to oppose austerity in any meaningful way. Neither seem to grasp the severity of the impact of what is proposed on people’s lives.\nHe continued,\nCouncil funding is now at crisis point and it’s the most vulnerable in Bristol who rely on essential council services who are going to suffer the most. We have seen year on year cuts – a slow chipping away of this funding may not seem dramatic, but the impacts it has are brutal. Now we are seeing cuts of a size and severity that are likely to leave tens of thousands without the support they need. We will see the impacts in the inability to care for our ageing population, in the growing number of homeless on our streets and the slow disappearance of our libraries and services. This council is heading into chaos.”\nTony Dyer, the Green Party spokesperson for local government said,\n“The government has, and is, pursuing an ideological campaign against local government and the poor. A recent report from the IFS clearly outlines that those councils serving the poorest communities have been hit the worst by Tory cuts. £187m has been cut from service spending by local authorities in the West of England, but 70% of these reductions have been borne by Bristol City Council. You cannot expect to take out that level of financial support without it having an impact on the ability of councils like Bristol to deliver the public services that so many of us rely on.\nHe continued,\nWhilst Conservative Councils like Hampshire and Surrey have seen cuts of just 1%, and the City of London has even seen a slight increase, England’s major provincial cities have seen an average cut of 28%. The Core Cities – which includes Bristol – have seen £1.4bn worth of annual spending removed from their budgets since the election of the Coalition government in 2010. The reality is that all the Core Cities are run by Labour – we need to see real examples of them working together to provide proper opposition and demand an end to the Government’s systematic dismantling of local government in this country – it cannot be left to Bristol alone to challenge central government. The implementation of a spending freeze can only be a temporary measure which may allow us to dodge the bullet this year, but the financial problems facing the council are likely to worsen rather than improve under the current government.”",

I have met people who pay extortionate rent, yet have daily battles to get their landlord to fix a broken toilet or mend a leaking roof.”\n“The Stapleton Road licencing scheme3 has successfully improved 700 private rented properties and resolved 199 serious hazards, by cracking down on rogue landlords. We are now calling on the Mayor to look at extending the scheme to other areas of the city, following consultation with local communities.”\nCracking down on landlords who do not provide basic standards is particularly important for students who rent across the city. Stephen Le Fanu, Student Living Officer at Bristol Students Union and member of ACORN student group at Bristol University said:\n“Our recent student housing survey showed that both University of Bristol and University of West of England students are frequently having to live in poor conditions and are charged rip-off fees. This is simply not acceptable. We have formed a group of students from across the city to tackle together some of the problems that students are individually facing and want to invite all those interested to get involved.”\nNick Ballard from Community housing organisation, ACORN who have been campaigning for ethical lettings across Bristol said:\n“Like any business, private rentals must be properly regulated and decent standards ensured. Landlord licensing is a vital first step in creating a register of landlords that will allow much-needed oversight. Permitting local authorities to inspect privately-rented property as a matter of course will protect tenants from the revenge evictions that too-often follow when we complain ourselves. ACORN is committed to the creation of a progressive and fair rental sector and landlord licensing is a fundamental requirement for this.”\nGreen Councillor Clive Stevens, who also represents Clifton Down concluded:\n“Landlords shouldn’t be able to profit from other peoples’ misery, they should be made to offer premises to an acceptable standard, in other walks of life businesses have to comply with the trades descriptions act, why not landlords?”\nENDS\nNotes\nEarlier this month a landlord couple were fined tens of thousands of pounds under the landlord licencing scheme in Easton: http://news.bristol.gov.uk/landlords-fined-for-not-having-the-correct-licences/\nThe Big Housing Conversation will be held on Sept 7th: https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/the-big-housing-conversation-tickets-26699712559\nThe Stapleton Road Licencing Scheme was started in 2013, and after its success at improving standards the scheme was extended to St George West and Eastville in Feb 2016.",

However the fate of the small area ‘diesel ban’ proposed by the Mayor is unclear as the government is still requesting further research and information from the Council to support this option. Green Councillors have previously raised concerns that this option was complicated and unworkable and could cause delays.\nMayor Rees is now lobbying the government to allow him to postpone the start date of Bristol’s Clean Air Zone, not currently due to commence until April 2021. The latest update from the government made clear it still expects Bristol to meet this deadline. Due to the impact of coronavirus on the economy the government has already advised cities which were due to launch Clean Air Zones in 2020 to delay their launch until January 2021 (2-3 months before Bristol’s expected start). During the pandemic, local business leaders in Bristol have re-stated their support for clean air measures (see notes below).\nGreen Councillors in Bristol have urged the Mayor to avoid further delays, pointing to the importance of clean and safe air for health, and noting reports of a link between numbers of coronavirus deaths and poor air quality. Leader of the Green Group, Councillor Eleanor Combley, said:\n“It would be understandable if some of the Council’s work is delayed due to the impact of the pandemic on key staff or absence levels, but it is not clear why the Mayor is calling for a delay in actually launching Bristol’s Clean Air Zone next year.\n“The Government have instructed other councils to wait to start their Clean Air Zones until January 2021. However, because Bristol has repeatedly delayed work and missed deadlines, our Clean Air Zone was not due to launch until months later. Any delays in cleaning up our air will cost more lives in Bristol, at a rate of about 300 each year. Where is the evidence that a further delay is needed?\n“Despite the pandemic, business leaders in Bristol have recently confirmed their support for measures to tackle air pollution. Polling consistently shows that a majority of the public, especially in cities, are in favour of such charging zones. And there is no doubt about the strength of evidence from transport and public health experts about the importance of safe, clean air. The Mayor needs to stop listening to a few select advisers and catch up with the rest of us.\n“People need to breathe clean, safe air to stay healthy. We know that air pollution in the UK kills over 40,000 people in an average year – worryingly, we are now seeing growing evidence that polluted air makes it harder for people to fight off and recover from Covid-19 and is linked to more deaths from the disease. People need clean, safe air now more than ever.”\nNotes\n– Following the Mayor’s call for a delay to protect businesses in local media, James Durie of Business West posted on social media about “the need for clean air” to be “at the centre” of recovering from coronavirus (). Gavin Bridge, director of property developer Cubex, has also called for clean air measures in Bristol after the pandemic.\n– Business West support what’s called a ‘CAZ D’ – a charging zone targeting all the most polluting vehicles whatever the type, rather than the Mayor’s ‘hybrid’ option of a small area diesel ban in the centre and a larger zone which charges commercial vehicles. Green Councillors support a ‘CAZ D’ option as it is line with other UK cities and reduces more air pollution than the Council’s current option (targeting both particulate emissions and Nitrogen oxide rather than just the latter), and would be simpler to understand, implement, and apply potential mitigation measures.\n– See cabinet reports here for more information, including the latest letter to the Council from the government.",

It includes a sum for investment we were told would last for 15 years.\nBut there’s no sight of any real 15-year capital programme and without further income, now the extra charges have been postponed, there is little extra money going into the service and this plan can’t go ahead.\nThe current notional budget revealed is well short of such spending – and higher than the actual spend for several years.\nIt also lacks money for a sum called ‘corporate income target’. This is really a cut to the service – a £55,000 budget cut ‘returned’ to the corporate centre that was written into most departments to shrink spending under austerity.\nFollowing our scrutiny, the reaction against massive rent increases spilled over into the meeting to set the council’s budget, as set by the outgoing mayor.\nSome years ago, a cost-of-living rise was approved by the Labour cabinet to cover 2018-2025. However, these were never implemented, so there has been no inflationary increase since 2018\nThe Labour mayor’s budget deal with Tories that ‘saved’ allotments from an annual inflation increase is an illusory deal, as these smaller rises have not actually been levied since at least 2018, even though cabinet agreed they should be made.\nThe lack of smaller, staged inflation rises has directly led to the decline of the service offered by the council for allotmenteers, as running costs have risen year by year.\nIn response to the disquiet created by the consultation and the mobilisation of the Bristol Allotmenteers Resist campaign, the proposed steep rent and water rises have become tricky too.\nThe cabinet increase therefore became a problem but is still expected to go ahead on Tuesday.\nWe expect cabinet to nod through the proposed increases in plot and water rents that have been debated in the consultation – though now it’s phased in two stages, half being levied in April 25 and the other half s in April 26.\nTo the best of my knowledge, there has not been a cabinet paper from this administration that has not been passed.\nWe need to acknowledge that the way plot rents are charged; the different plot sizes, the unequal scale increases for smaller and larger plots, the way increases will hit many deprived areas of the city, and the impact on big areas used by community growing projects, are all contested, as well as the benchmarks used to compare Bristol fees to other authorities.\nAlternative ways to levy charges have been suggested, for example square metre charges rather than arbitrary bands.\nBut standstill prices aren’t an option. A service without a capital fund to invest is one in decline as everything from water pipes to fencing will require repairs and investment.\nAllotments are an invaluable service provided by the council, but the reality is that even after the full proposed Labour Cabinet rises in 2025 and 2026 the capital programme and kickback of £55,000 is still illusionary.\nThe department gets subsidised by the wider parks budget which earns money from events and concessions.\nFollowing the recent outcry, there is now a very highly mobilised group of service users whose trust in the council has been eroded and who experience a very weak service.\nOne extra member of staff being promised won’t change that, even if some capital gets found.\nThe relationship with service users and stakeholders is now blighted – there are worried tenants, their helpers, community growing groups fearing new plot and water fees, and site reps (where they exist) who have been led to believe they shall have lots more rules to manage.\nThe various rule changes and extra fees have now been left behind by the mayor for the new committee system to rethink.\nThese relationships will need to be rebuilt to come up with collaborative, constructive solutions to create a better funded service, which will be tough but not out of reach if we bring in new ways of working in partnership with stakeholders.\nCllr Martin Fodor is the Chair of the Environment and Sustainability Committee\nMore about Martin",

The survey by Trip Advisor also names two other Cornwall beaches in the top 10 – Porthminster in St Ives and Perranporth; two more in Dorset – Bournemouth and Hengistbury Head, as well as Woolacombe beach in Devon. Dr Scott Cato said:\n“During my time as an MEP I have had the pleasure of visiting many of the South West’s beautiful beaches. It comes as no surprise that seven of the top ten rated beaches are in our region. This shows that clean beaches and a protected environment are key to a successful tourism industry”.\nDr Scott Cato says it is vital to continue to safeguard our environment post-Brexit. She said:\n“I can remember holidaying on beaches when we still pumped raw sewage into our seas. We have EU regulation to thank for forcing us to clean up our coastlines. We must continue to apply high environmental standards and regulations post-Brexit”.\nThe Greens are pressing for an Environmental Protection Act as part of a series of Green guarantees to ensure environmental regulation remains at least as strong as current EU regulation. A key demand is for an independent court to ensure UK compliance with the rules.\nMolly Scott Cato concluded:\n“The environment doesn’t even feature in Theresa May’s 12-point plan on Brexit. The Conservatives have made worrying noises about weakening environmental regulations, dismissing them as red tape. But the popular beaches of the South West show that these regulations not only make environmental sense; they make business sense too.\n“While we remain members of the EU, the UK must clean up its act, as it is currently being forced to do over the UKs appalling air quality. But once we leave the EU, there is a danger the government will seek to water down regulations. If we are to prevent ourselves again becoming the dirty man of Europe, we need an Environmental Protection Act and to ensure that high environmental standards are legally binding”.",

It goes on to cite the cuts to government grant income, combined with the increasing cost and rises in demand for council services, as issues directly impacting on how the council structures and funds the services it offers.\nThe report further highlights “a collective failure of leadership” in achieving past savings and in how the council managed the process, specifically highlighting the need for greater democratic accountability of officer reports.\nCommenting on the report, leader of the Green group of councillors, Charlie Bolton, said,\n“It would be easy for this report to turn into a blame game, but the term ‘collective failure’ is crucial here. This report is further proof that the council is an institution struggling under the weight of cuts and failing in part to adequately address them. Local government services and social care are being abandoned by this Tory government whilst it spends hundreds of billions of pounds replacing Trident, building a new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point and building HS2. Bristol City Council has already suffered savage cuts – we have seen over £170 million of cuts by central government over the last 6 years and extensive job losses within the council. We are now approaching breaking point.”\nHe continued, “There are clear lessons to be learnt from this report and as Greens we will continue to put forward practical and principled responses and alternatives to the cuts (2) from redirecting business rates into social care through to increasing parking charges at some sites around the city.

  "https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_/https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_news_green-budget-amendment-tackles-transport-and-climate-crisis/content_239.html": "menu\nGreen councillors have submitted a budget amendment to next week’s Budget Full Council to boost the Council’s work to tackle the climate emergency. The amendment allocates almost £10m for the housing department to dramatically scale up ‘retrofitting’ improvements and renewable energy schemes on council houses. It also proposes training council staff and apprentices to install low carbon and green technologies like heat pumps. To tackle the city’s gridlocked traffic system as well as the climate crisis, the amendment earmarks over 12 million pounds for transport improvement works in the city, focusing on local walking and cycling improvements.\nIn order to help fund transport improvements Greens propose a congestion charge on out-of-town drivers which could raise over £6m per year, and starting work on plans for a charge on companies that provide private workplace parking (a workplace parking levy). Cardiff council is planning a similar congestion charge to boost its transport plans and in Nottingham a workplace parking levy has raised over £44 million in 5 years, used to fund the city’s tram network.\nAs well as raising funding for transport improvements such as making buses faster and cheaper or pedestrianising parts of the city, these changes would reduce the number of private cars in the city centre, thereby improving air quality, reducing carbon emissions, reducing bus journey delays and making it easier for people to walk and cycle.\nLeader of the Green Group, councillor Eleanor Combley said:\n“After four long years, in the Labour administration’s final budget, the sense of urgency to tackle Climate Change is still lacking. And where are the big ideas to unstick our transport system and get our city moving again? After years of talk with no action from politicians, Bristol is crying out for practical answers to the city’s problems.\n“In our amendment to the budget we have proposed simple and necessary work to reduce our climate impact and tackle long-standing problems for Bristol. Adding solar panels and battery storage to council houses and improving their heat efficiency will lower people’s energy bills and carbon emissions, and generate green energy for Bristol, while creating much needed employment. We’ve found funding to train up council workers with the skills the city’s going to need to install green technology like heat pumps. To address years of stagnation in Bristol’s transport, we’re allocating money to make walking and cycling improvements actually happen rather than leaving it to the lottery of grant applications.\n“Finally, we’re proposing action to deal with our city’s interlinked problems of air pollution and traffic chaos. Ultimately you cannot tackle either of these without addressing the root cause: there are just too many private vehicles in the centre of town. Our amendment would fund better buses, raising millions of pounds to improve public transport – through introducing a congestion charge for those driving into Bristol from out of town. This addresses the gridlocked traffic system that costs buses more and stops them running on time.\n“If accepted at the budget meeting our amendment would help get Bristol moving again and take urgent action to address the climate crisis. As opposition councillors we do what we can for Bristol, but at the end of the day we need leadership in this city that deep down understands these issues and treats them as priorities rather than window dressing.”\nMore information on the Green amendment is below. For full details, see pages 210 to 212 in the reports pack submitted to the council meeting here. Update: see also the attached document.\nThese measures would set money aside for cycling and walking infrastructure each year to ensure it is delivered, as opposed to the current approach which bids for small pots of government funding as and when it is available.\nBristol’s current piecemeal approach to cycling and walking infrastructure is in part due to its reliance on small one-off pots of grant funding, released occasionally by central government. While the Council’s transport plans in theory prioritise cycling and walking, in practice money is frequently set aside for roads and not for the other infrastructure. The Green amendment would deal with this and guarantee delivery by setting £8.75m aside over five years for cycling and walking infrastructure projects identified in the Council’s recent Local Cycling and Walking Infrastructure Plan.\nOn top of this in year 5 (2024/25) the Greens expect revenue from the congestion charge to be available and from this would allocate an extra £4 million for local transport improvements. This could include new bike lanes, low-traffic neighbourhood schemes, pedestrian-only areas, making changes to roads to speed up bus journey times or subsidising bus routes and reducing ticket costs.\nThese measures would help tackle the climate emergency by insulating much more council housing to good standards, piloting solar panels and battery storage to council buildings, and training council staff and hiring apprentices to install renewable energy and low carbon technologies such as heat pumps.\nThe Green amendment would allocate £9.9m to the Housing Revenue Account (HRA) to scale up retrofitting work and piloting renewable energy projects with Bristol’s council housing stock. Just over a quarter (around 27%) of council homes have an energy efficiency rating of D or below, which means higher carbon emissions and energy bills for residents. The Green amendment would prioritise these first, before moving onto the thousands more with a rating of C. Retrofitting work would improve insulation, but also look at preventing overheating which will become more of an issue in the coming years. The amendment would also scale up a planned trial of solar panels and battery storage on council housing. This would reduce people’s energy bills as well as generate green energy for the city with surplus electricity.\nAt the same time, the amendment provides funding to train council staff on changing low carbon and renewable energy technologies, so the Council can complete installation and maintenance in-house, and hire up to twelve apprentices in those areas, helping to develop a workforce in Bristol which is able to fill the skilled Green jobs of the future.\nThese measures would reduce private car use in the city centre and raise money to fund improvements to public transport or for cycling and walking infrastructure.\nA congestion charge would apply only to commuters from outside Bristol. A similar charge is being introduced by Cardiff Council to support a package of transport changes including cheaper bus fares. Last year finance officers approved Green calculations that this could generate over £6 million in revenue each year. In order to reduce the cost this scheme could use the same number-plate recognition cameras the council is already buying for its clean air plans.\nGreens also propose funding a feasibility study to build on previous work and take the next steps towards a workplace parking levy. This would introduce a charge on employers in Bristol who provide private workplace parking. (Frequently this is provided as a perk to some of their highest paid employees.) Nottingham used the revenue generated by their scheme to double the size of their tram network and fund other transport work, generating over £44 million between the scheme launch in 2012 and 2017.",

In Summer 2017 the Council requested funding and was provided with over half a million pounds to carry out the necessary work – since then a feasibility study was set up to explore various options for a Clean Air Zone in the city.\nEnvironment minister Therese Coffey has written a letter to the Mayor stating that the Government gave Bristol Council the required support and funding to ensure it could meet the deadlines and said she was “absolutely astonished at [the Mayor’s] delay in improving air quality for the people of Bristol as quickly as possible.”\nCllr Jerome Thomas, deputy leader of the Bristol Green councillors said:\n“Greens first passed the Council motion to commit Bristol to take action on air pollution back in 2016. Over two years later it seems the Labour administration is scarcely any closer to dealing with our city’s toxic air – to the extent that the Government is now considering legal action against the council for failing to meet its legal requirement to set out plans by the required deadline. Meanwhile, the lives of over 300 Bristolians are cut short by toxic air each year.\n“I was willing to give the Mayor the benefit of the doubt for a long time, but I have to say it is beginning to look like these delays are due to either a lack of interest in prioritising clean air for Bristol or deliberate interference with the feasibility study that was commissioned to find a solution. This study is supposed to be impartial, yet the Mayor’s political views are clear from repeated statements implying he is opposed to options that charge polluting vehicles – despite this likely being the most effective way to protect the health of Bristolians. The question needs to be asked, is the Mayor letting politics get in the way of cleaning up our poisonous air? Children in our city currently inhale the equivalent of two cigarettes a day in toxic air.”\nSandy Hore-Ruthven, Bristol Green candidate for Mayor, said:\n“If Bristol City Council fails in its legal duty to comply, this is a serious failure to the people of Bristol and its environment. The Mayor must provide an explanation for these delays and prioritise producing a plan for Bristol and then implement it. Whether the Mayor has been deliberately stalling while Bristol chokes or simply failing to pay attention to the clean air crisis in our city, it is frankly outrageous to continue neglecting the health and lives of Bristolians – particularly those in the most deprived areas of the city, where there are very low rates of car ownership but as many as 10% of deaths are attributable to air pollution.”",

Over 6,500 people signed a petition calling for Bristol to stop spraying glyphosate based weed-killer such as ‘Roundup’ on the streets and parks of Bristol, forcing a debate in next week’s council meeting.\nA year ago, the World Health Organisation found that glyphosate, which is found in most weed-killers is a probable human carcinogen. Since then many countries have restricted the use or banned glyphosate including the Netherlands, France, Bermuda and Sri Lanka, with Brazil, Germany and Argentina also considering bans.\nZaheer Mamon, who started the petition, said:\n“I am deeply concerned that Bristol City Council continue to use chemicals such as Roundup on our streets and parks when glyphosates have been banned in so many other countries and cities around the world due to health concerns. I started the petition to raise awareness of this issue and to allow local residents to send the message loud and clear that this spraying in our public spaces has to stop with immediate effect and with no compromise.”\n“Our case has been strengthened by the fact that Glastonbury Town Council have recently set the precedent of banning glyphosates in our back yard. If Bristol is to have any credibility as a ‘green’ city it must take action and follow Glastonbury’s lead without delay.”\nGreen Councillor for Ashley, Gus Hoyt said:\n“I have been raising my concerns with the council about their use of glyphosate in Bristol for over two years, including calling on the Mayor for full transparency on how much glyphosate is currently used by the Council and calling for alternatives to be trialled.”\n“Other councils such as Glastonbury have shown that it is perfectly possible to ban glyphosate and use alternative methods to control weeds*. I am pleased that the Council has taken on my suggestion of doing a ward trial for alternatives to glyphosate, but am concerned that the trial may use vinegar to control weeds, rather than Foamstream which has been successfully used by other authorities. We need to ban glyphosate from our streets and parks across the city as soon as possible, so it is important to use the most effective alternative to this chemical.”\nHarriet Williams, of the Pesticide Safe Bristol Alliance said:\n“The impacts of glyphosate use are very real – we are hearing from people whose pets have been poisoned and from parents concerned about sprays contaminating their children’s clothes and getting into their mouths.”\n“Thanks to our FOI request, we know that the Council or its contractors are applying glyphosate to an area of the city equivalent to 3,600 football pitches. But Bristolians do not want our city’s streets, pavements and parks to be sprayed with toxic weed killers. Our opinion survey shows that nine out of ten residents support a complete ban on such chemicals, or heavy restrictions on their use. We urge the Council to listen to public opinion and take city-wide action to eliminate this unnecessary health risk.”\n*The only exception being for highly invasive species such as Japanese knotweed.\nImage © Flickr/Michelle Tribe",

The percentage is set to continue climbing in coming weeks as more local parties select candidates ready to stand for the common good.\nThe increased appetite for Green values and policies – as demonstrated by the Party’s best polling in a generation – will be met by increased opportunities to vote Green at the ballot box on May 7th 2015.\nBennett, Lucas and Darren Hall, PPC for Bristol West, made speeches and took questions at the official campaign launch where a ‘Standing for the Common Good’ campaign poster was unveiled to the media.\nIn her speech, Natalie Bennett, The Green Party Leader and PPC for Holborn and St Pancras, outlined the party’s six key electoral themes (2).\n“Something profound is happening in British Politics. The old way of doing things is falling apart as the politics of hope triumphs over the politics of fear. The Green Party wants to create a political system that puts the public first and we believe we have the means to achieve that ambition. Our membership numbers have soared, our poll ratings are the best for a generation and we’re going to be fighting our biggest, boldest campaign ever. It’s a truly exciting time to be part of The Green Party.”\nCaroline Lucas MP, recently named Patchwork’s MP of the Year (3) and widely tipped to retain her Brighton Pavilion seat, spoke about her time as a local MP and record of standing up for her constituents in the community and Parliament.\nLucas said:\n“A good local MP insists on getting the answers that need to be had, asking the questions that must be asked on behalf of constituents. As a Green MP, I have no Party whip – and my voice has been much stronger for it. My position isn’t decided for me by a Party official – my constituents feed into every speech and every vote.\n“In fighting for the issues that matter most to Brighton residents – from a truly protected NHS, improved and public Railways, a fair and resilient local economy; in addressing the housing and cost of living crisis and standing up for local schools and individual constituents – I think I’ve been able to demonstrate how much one MP can do if they really want to.\n“And as austerity cuts deepen and privatisation tightens its grip on our public services – Party lines, far from becoming more distinctive, have blurred into one another. Parliament needs a clear, strong Green voice now, perhaps, more than ever.”\nDarren Hall, the Green Party’s Prospective Parliamentary Candidate in Bristol West, has seen his odds of success dramatically improve in recent weeks. Recent local election results in his constituency suggest that Hall could be joining Lucas in Parliament in May.\nHall said:\n“In Bristol the sense of change is palpable. Our membership numbers have surged, and people from across the city are getting involved in my campaign. The fact is that people like our policies – our job is to make sure they hear about them. The momentum is with us in Bristol, as it is across the UK, and these next ten weeks will, no doubt, be very exciting.”\nThe Green Party – which has seen membership surge from 12,000 in 2010 to over 54,000 today – is targeting seats up and down the UK, from St Ives to Liverpool Riverside.\nBaroness Jenny Jones introduced the launch, which took place at the Royal Society of Arts at 10.00.\n1. The Green Party has selected candidates in 390 constituencies across England and Wales with 119 still to be confirmed. That means that the Greens will stand in at least 509 seats (or 88.83% of the total 573 seats).\n2 Themes:\n3. http://greenparty.org.uk/news/2014/11/06/caroline-lucas-named-mp-of-the-year/",

The “Greenest government ever” Lib Dem and Conservative coalition is proposing to delete elements of the Code for Sustainable Homes, removing the ability of local planning authorities to set Code standards nationally that incorporate Carbon and energy targets. Especially in this current economic climate, this would directly lead to a lower quality for the lifetime of new homes, making it more difficult for this country to reduce its carbon emissions.\n“High quality and energy efficient homes are not only good for the planet but they are good for the householder, meaning that they pay much less on their energy bills. This is such a short-sited move under the supposed guise of removing ‘red tape’.” said Daniella Radice, Leader of the Green Group on the Council.\nGus Hoyt, cabinet member for Environment and Housing said, “Bristol is setting itself up as an example through the Green Capital City 2015. We must ensure we keep to our goal to reduce our carbon footprint, but we need national standards and our newly adopted Core Strategy to do this”.\n“Some of the biggest energy savings we can make in a city is through our built environment.

The calls were backed by unions including the National Education Union and UNISON (Bristol Council’s largest union), environmentalists such as Friends of the Earth, as well as Green Party Councillors who have been campaigning on the issue for some years.\nJackie Walkden, one of the campaigners who helped to organise the campaign, said in her statement to the meeting:\n“People are very worried about climate change, and increasingly so. They have heard the weak message from COP26, and they want change. In particular, they don’t want their pension contributions, which come from public money, to fund climate chaos. We hope that seeing these cards will help the mayor hear their voices.”\nGreen councillors have repeatedly called on Bristol Council to join cities like London, Paris, Glasgow and New York which have committed to divest their assets and pension funds from fossil fuel companies. In 2019 Labour and Conservative councillors voted to amend a Green motion to back divestment which had the support of the Council’s largest union, rendering it ineffective. In September 2020 Bristol’s Mayor signed a declaration committing “to take all possible steps to divest city assets from fossil fuel companies” but no action to divest funds has since been taken by the Council through its place on the staff pension fund.\nGreen Councillor Katy Grant said:\n“Both Brunel Pension Partnership and Avon Pension Fund have made recent press statements about shifts of some investments towards a Paris-aligned passive fund, but this is still not ambitious enough. In the aftermath of COP26, we all now know that the Paris 2-degree benchmark is completely out of date; and the goal of a 50% reduction in carbon emissions from the pension holding over the next ten years is not fast enough. “\n“Bristol City Council should be at the forefront of urgent efforts to get Avon Pension Fund to move all fossil fuel investments into the opportunities provided by renewable energy. Why would the first city in the UK to call a climate emergency be dragging its feet on this?”\nInvestment in fossil fuels is seen as increasingly risky as the need for governments to act on the climate crisis requires leaving fossil fuels in the earth. Last year it was revealed that the value of oil company shares held by 56 local government retirement schemes had halved since 2017. Geoff Allan, from Bristol Friends of the Earth, said:\n“With the fossil fuel age ending, and renewables stock prices growing at 20% a year, it makes no sense for pension fund managers not to divest while they still can.”\nUnison, Bristol Council’s largest staff union, supported the Greens’ divestment call in 2019. Ian Watkins, Bristol Unison’s climate officer, gave a statement (4) which stated:\n“Bristol Unison Branch has for a number of years been active in holding APF to account for their investment portfolio and proposed schedule to divest away from fossil fuels.\nWe acknowledge and welcome the progress they have made but feel that given the Climate Emergency that has been declared by Bristol City Council and other neighbouring local Authorities, much more needs to be done and at a faster timescale.\nWe feel that simply trying to engage with carbon intensive companies is too weak a strategy at this point in time. There should be immediate divestment from companies with no zero carbon strategy or who don’t even acknowledge Climate Change as an issue and a much faster move to full divestment by 2030 rather than 2050.\nUnison sees the transition to a greener economy, with well trained, unionised and secure jobs as an essential part of the fight against climate change. Avon Pension Fund is a key part of this – our pension contributions and the funds which BCC matches them with, should be used to invest in green technologies and training, both locally and in the wider Southwest, rather than in increasingly financially risky carbon intensive and polluting sectors in far flung reaches of the world. This investment switch should start now to avoid the diminishing returns that fossil fuels will offer going forward.\nThere will be no jobs on a dead planet!”\nThe campaign is also being supported by the National Education Union, the largest education union in Europe. Tom Bolton, Bristol National Education Union (NEU) Branch Secretary and Loz Hennessy, Bristol NEU Climate Officer, said:\n“All workers are entitled to a healthy, happy retirement where we can live in dignity. As education workers, we believe our families and our students deserve a future free from climate catastrophe. Fossil fuel consumption is driving this catastrophe. APS needs to disinvest now. Anything less is climate denial. Educators support divestment!”\nAnne Lemon, a local teacher and member of Bristol Coalition Against Climate Change, said:\n“As a teacher and recipient of what was the Avon pension fund, I am appalled to discover that the fund still has investments in the fossil fuel industry.\n“What came out of COP26 in no way starts to tackle the impending climate catastrophe which is heading our way. There were no serious measures to limit the use of fossil fuels. We need to take action in every way that we can.\n“A good step would be for our Mayor, Marvin Rees, to lead the campaign to make the pension scheme remove its funds from the fossil fuel industry. In particular companies like ‘BlackRock’ who are profiteering from the deforestation of the Amazon rain forest. Act Now.”",

The latest draft is the culmination of years of cross-party work, with a group tasked to update the previous Local Plan first adopted in 2011.\nGreen councillors pushed hard to ensure the new plan reflects the climate and ecological emergency declarations, as well as working to support the delivery of affordable homes and culture within the plan, though some individual concerns remained about specific site allocations.\nSpeaking ahead of the debate, Green shadow cabinet member for Planning and City Design Cllr Jenny Bartle said, “This plan sets out the innovation to make developers include affordable units in their designs from the outset, no matter what their viability assessment says. This means that we will have significantly more opportunities to deliver housing at a cost Bristolians can afford.”\nJenny added, “Greens do not have a majority on the council but have pressed hard and been meticulous on every policy at every step, and the Local Plan Working Group is an example of where cross party councillors can come together and develop progressive policy for Bristol.”\nThe new Local Plan will provide a strong base of rules for Greens in City Hall after the next election to strengthen further policy around development, as well as the protection of vital green spaces, such as Yew Tree Farm.\nGreen Shadow Cabinet member for Housing Delivery and Homes Cllr Tony Dyer, said, “We have worked hard to ensure this Local Plan provides Bristol with a very solid set of rules that address both the climate and housing crisis and elected Greens will be making sure they deliver on these.

All amendments must enable a balanced budget, and are debated in the chamber.\nThe amendments that Labour decided to vote against included Green amendment that re-directed councillor parking perks to the most vulnerable and an amendment which found an additional £1.7m at no extra cost to the tax-payer to reduce the cuts to the most vulnerable across the city.\nCouncillor Jude English said:\n“For Labour councillors to decide to vote against all amendments from other parties, before even listening to the debate in the chamber makes a mockery of the budget meeting, and of the Mayor’s promise at the last Cabinet meeting to consider input through the amendment process.”\nCouncillor Eleanor Combley, who proposed Councillors relinquish their parking perks to bring in much needed revenue to reduce cuts said:\n“The Mayor is asking local communities to step up or do without. They are being asked to find ways of running libraries and parks, check on elderly neighbours who are losing their safety net of a daily visit from community meals, and to find their way to some remote service point because their local council building is closing down.”\n“Yet at a time when across the city front-line services to the most vulnerable are being slashed, councillors from other parties have refused to relinquish their free parking spaces that could instead be bringing in much needed revenue to support people with mental health issues, learning difficulties, sensory impairment or HIV.”\nClifton Down councillor Clive Stevens, who identified that £1.7m of money earmarked to increase reserves in five years’ time could be more sustainably directed towards solving urgent budget pressures this year said:\n“After identifying this money we looked at where it could be best used to reduce the cuts across the city. I proposed to use £1m to improve the effectiveness of key services for the vulnerable or those out of food for example. Despite this, Labour have voted against this amendment which deeply saddens me and makes me wonder what they now stand for.”",

Adjacent to Eastville Park, the fields are designated part of a Historic Park and Garden, an Important Open Space, and Wildlife Corridor in the Bristol Local Plan[1]. The fields are owned by the Merchant Venturers, who have submitted a planning application for developing the land into luxury housing. The closing date for objections to the application is 8th July[2].\nLocal residents have been dismayed by developers’ pre-planning activity, which destroyed a valuable nesting site at the very start of the nesting season, and is believed to have resulted in the partial collapse of a badger sett. Subsequently Protect Frome Valley have started a petition calling for the development of brownfield sites to be given much more emphasis in order to safeguard greenfield sites [3].\nWith a housing crisis leaving ever increasing numbers of people precariously housed, Councils are under pressure to allow development of greenfield sites. However, a report by the Campaign for the Protection of Rural England (CPRE), based on research by UWE[4], suggests Bristol brownfield sites have a development capacity of 30,000 houses. As a Party committed to environmental and social justice, Bristol Greens have pointed out that the ongoing loss of green spaces disproportionately affects poorer residents.\nChris Faulkner Gibson, Campaign Organiser from Protect Frome Valley, said, “this development has nothing to do with easing the housing shortage and is wrong for so many reasons: it would severely damage the public amenity of Eastville Park and this part of the Frome Valley, jeopardise the establishment of viable breeding populations of otters and kingfishers and pose a threat to every other green open space in Bristol. If multiple protective planning designations can be easily set aside purely for the developer’s profit then no other green open space in the City will be safe.”\nGus Hoyt, Green Party Councillor for Ashley, said, “Bristol is in the midst of a housing crisis but we must look to ways to protect our valuable green spaces and nature reserves which make this city such a wonderful place to live. Building yet more luxury housing at the detriment of the city’s wildlife will not solve the housing crisis Bristol is facing at the moment.”\nSimon Stafford-Townsend, Green Party candidate for Eastville in May’s election, said, “this development risks setting a precedent that will threaten Bristol’s green spaces. It comes amidst a housing crisis that calls for affordable and social housing, not high end housing that will only further fuel rising house prices in the area. With George Osborne delivering further cuts on Wednesday, applications like this set the scene for the future development of publicly owned green spaces.”\nNotes\nProtect Frome Valley @ Stapleton is a constituted Community Association formed by local residents as a response to this development proposal. When this campaign is over the group will be working with the Greater Fishponds Neighbourhood Partnership’s Planning Group to help develop a positive neighbourhood plan. They can be contacted via facebook (https://www.facebook.com/groups/savefromevalleyatstapleton/), twitter (@stapletonBS16), or web (www.protect.fromevalley.org)\n[1] Detailed guidance on the relevant planning policies affecting this application are online here: http://protect.fromevalley.org/bristol-city-council-planning-policies/\n[2] Objections to planning application 15/01870/F can be made online here: http://tinyurl.com/qchczre\n[3] The petition can be found on the City Council’s e-petitioning site here: http://epetitions.bristol.gov.uk/epetition_core/community/petition/3137\n[4] From Wasted Space to Living Spaces report published by the Campaign for the Protection of Rural England (CPRE) and based on research by UWE.

We need to instil a greater level of financial sustainability across all levels of the organisation so we can deliver needed services in a fair and equitable way in the future.\n“Our motives as an administration are to work collaboratively to build a happier, greener and more resilient city. This won’t happen if we don’t tackle our finances and put the council on a sounder financial footing, and that’s what this budget does.”\n“Make no mistake that local authorities across the country will continue to have to make cuts unless this Government delivers more support so we can provide vital services that some of our country’s most vulnerable people rely on.”\nThe council has a legal obligation to set a balanced budget every year. A full range of options brought forward by council departments to make £52 million of savings were made public and discussed by the cross-party Finance Sub-Committee earlier in the month.\nThe draft budget, which took all these discussions into account, will now be taken to the Strategy and Resources Policy Committee for further scrutiny and discussion before being brought by the Leader of the Council to a meeting of the full council on the 25th of February for adoption. Political parties will also have a chance to bring amendments to the budget to this meeting.\nHaving listened to the concerns that Bristol’s affected communities have put forward, several of the original proposals have not been taken forward. These include a proposal to cut £2.4million from the existing £4.7million libraries budget.\nWhile there is recognition that savings will have to be made in the future, a cross-party working group will be set up by the Public Health and Communities Policy Committee to decide how to reform the library service across the city.\nLiberal Democrat Cllr Stephen Williams, Chair of the Public Health and Communities policy Committee, said, “This working group will be able to conduct a root-and-branch review of the library service. I’m pleased that we will now have the time and space to do this meaningfully, without the immediate pressure of a budgetary cut. However, one of our objectives will be to craft a service that is financially sustainable.\n“We will also be looking at ways of improving the service offering by having libraries open at the times of day most useful for their communities. Additionally, we will see what other activities could take place in the network of library buildings, and whether library outlets could be opened in other venues. I look forward to working with the various library ‘friends-of’ groups and others who want to see a revamped service that meets the needs of Bristol.”\nOther proposals that have not been taken forward in the final budget include proposals to cut school crossing patrols and charging for disabled parking bay installation, after pushback from the Chair of the Transport and Connectivity Committee, Cllr Ed Plowden.\nCllr Plowden said, “Our school crossing patrol officers, or lollipop people as they are affectionately known, do a truly fantastic job in dangerous circumstances. Working split shifts in all weathers for the living wage, they make such a difference to the journey to school for so many children who must cross dangerous streets.\n“While I am delighted that we don’t need to take forward the reduction in school crossing patrols, I’m also determined to reduce road danger. By working together with the emergency services, but more importantly all the people who drive and move goods and services around Bristol, we can make Bristol’s streets safer for our children once and for all.”\nAny changes to the Council Tax Reduction Scheme will also not be in this year’s budget, and a cross-party working group working with external stakeholders, including organisations like ACORN, will be set up to examine how best the Council can support low income families in the future. This will include looking at the council tax reduction scheme.\nThe reduction and closure of the Cultural Investment Programme has been deferred, as well as the proposed closure of Blaise Museum, Red lodge Museum and the Georgian House Museum.\nThe cross-party committee on culture will now look at plans for alternative funding for arts and culture, including the best ways to utilise these cultural assets.\nWhile making significant savings in some areas, the budget will also invest in vital areas to improve the lives of Bristol residents:\nTransport\nChildren and Young People\nHousing Revenue Account\nCllr Barry Parsons, Chair of the Homes and Housing delivery Policy Committee, said “We will be investing tens of millions to bring council homes up to a safe and decent standard and deal with a huge backlog of repairs that has built up under the previous administration.\n“We’re also investing to tackle homelessness, buying 75 new homes for temporary accommodation, and stopping people becoming homeless in the first place.

This is the scale of ambition and action that we need, if we are going to safeguard Londoners and all our futures.”\nAfter Bristol Council’s motion at Full Council meeting November 13, similar targets have recently passed in other local authorities with Green members such as Stroud District Council and the Forest of Dean.\nReacting to the news in Bristol, Clifton Down Councillor Carla Denyer said:\n“It is so exciting to see another Climate Emergency motion like my own being proposed and passed in London, following hot on the heels of Stroud District Council putting similar plans in place. I am proud of Bristol and the Southwest for continuing its tradition as the birthplace of radical movements, and hope to see more motions with ambitious carbon neutrality targets being passed by Councils in the coming months. Well done to Caroline Russell – one of the two Green London Assembly Members – whose motion passed last week in London. It just goes to show the huge value of having Greens elected in local government – without Green councillors in Bristol and London, these motions simply would not have been proposed.”\nImage is of Green London Assembly Member Caroline Russell.

I can’t help asking myself if this change of heart isn’t perhaps just sour grapes because they realise they are never going to win it?\nIf we were talking about narrow self-interest, you could argue that Greens also have a reason for a change of heart – it is widely viewed that our mayoral candidate Sandy Hore-Ruthven is the one to beat in the coming campaign: the most likely challenger to win. Personally, I am excited about working to get Sandy elected, and about the good he would be able to do for this city as Mayor. However, I still don’t think the mayoral system is the right one. I also believe that democracy is a process, not a one-off event, and that even having voted for something once, people have the right to change their minds.\nBut what is the point of this motion now? There cannot be a referendum on this before 2022, so the system won’t change for over 2 years whatever Full Council decides. What we need to do now is work to elect a Mayor who will work for the whole city; who will give Scrutiny proper respect; who will welcome and listen to a diversity of voices; who will make the existing system work as well as it can. The twin emergencies of climate change and the needs of the people of this city, are both far too urgent to sit on our hands from here to 2022.\nGreens would like to make many changes to make our politics more democratic. We would replace FPTP with a proportional system in which every vote matters and people can vote for what they believe in, instead of anxiously consulting a spreadsheet about how best to vote against the party they dislike the most. However we stand for election under the system that exists and work hard within it wherever we do get elected.\nIn the same way we will be standing a candidate for the mayoral election, and we will be setting out the positive Green vision for how Bristol could be better for all of us. And once elected, a Green mayor will work both to achieve those goals, and to make the mayoral system work as well as possible.\nSo we don’t have a single position on this motion: some of the group think it’s spite and sour grapes from the Conservatives and reject it, some are sufficiently opposed to the mayoral system with its tendency towards centralising and autocracy that they will hold their noses and vote for it, some think it is a pointless conversation to be having just now and will be abstaining. As ever, we are not whipped and will each be voting according to our own consciences.",
  "https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_/https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_brexit-announcement-molly-scott-cato-full-speech/content_599.html": "menu\nMolly Scott Cato’s full speech (check against delivery):\nFirstly, as an MEP, working in the European Parliament; seeing firsthand the many positive things the EU is doing, I would like to congratulate Caroline for refusing to vote to trigger article 50.\nI would also like to thank the 113 other MPs – from Labour, LibDems, SNP, and Plaid Cymru – for doing likewise. What we saw on Article 50 was a genuine progressive alliance against the government’s plans for an extreme Brexit.\nIt is only a tragedy that so few Labour MPs followed their hearts and their minds and instead capitulated both to Theresa May and the whips within their own Party.\nSince the 24th June last year, it seems to me that it has been the Tory government that has been moving us towards the hard Brexit cliff edge, but Labour that has stood ready to push us off.\nThe Party has shown itself hopelessly divided and the failure to oppose the government on this the most critical issue for generations has played straight into the hands of the Tory Right.\nBy voting in such large numbers to trigger Article 50, without fighting for any conditions, Labour MPs have effectively handed Theresa May a blank cheque.\nAnd we know what the small print on the back of this cheque is:\nInvoking delegated powers, which would enable the government to make post-Brexit laws behind Parliament’s back.\nA Great Repeal Bill allowing the government to tear up EU legislation that has both improved and protected our environment, and defended workers’ rights. This bonfire of regulation is a threat to everything we hold dear – clean air, clean water, landscapes where wildlife can flourish – and my meetings with businesses tell me that it is not what they want.\nWe have also seen the politics of consensus between EU nations replaced by the language of hostility, whether it be the threat of gunships to solve a dispute about Gibraltar or the threat of creating a tax haven if you cannot get your way on trade deals.\nBut wait. Didn’t we hear Labour’s Brexit spokesperson, Keir Starmer, say that Labour would rip up Theresa May’s Brexit plan?\nWe should not be taken in by Labour’s apparently softer more considered approach to Brexit. Their message is confused and contradictory and still has some uncomfortable hard edges.\nThey promise to guarantee existing rights to all EU nationals living in the UK, but say they will end free movement. Yet they also want to retain the benefits of the single market and the customs union.\nTaking a tough stance on freedom of movement is incompatible with membership of the single market, something Keir Starmer himself acknowledged.\nGreens believe that remaining in the single market is vital for protecting jobs and workers’ rights. That in turn means defending free movement. In particular, we want young people to continue to enjoy the rights enjoyed by their parents and grandparents – the right to travel, study and work across Europe.\nIf Labour believe, like the Tories, that the fundamental rules of the club – such as the four freedoms – will be bent or watered down to accommodate a hardline UK, they clearly do not understand that the EU works by unity of purpose. Theresa May’s attempt to portray the remaining 27 EU members as somehow ganging up on Britain shows that she shares her party’s inability to understand how the EU works. Her approach to the negotiations demonstrates that she is constitutionally unable to cooperate and her confrontational stance is damaging our relationships with our closest neighbours for generations to come.\nLike Labour, we will of course ditch the great repeal bill, but we would replace this with a Great Reform Bill, to deliver a fair and proportional election system, reform the House of Lords and introduce a written constitution, so we know what our rights are.\nLabour say they would prioritise jobs and the economy in negotiations with the EU. These are of course vital, which is why we say we should stay in the single market. But such a focus risks side-lining the environment. This is why the Green Party is committed to both a new Environmental Protection Act and a Clean Air Act to ensure environmental protections are maintained and enhanced.\nLabour’s call for parliament to be given a truly meaningful vote on the final Brexit deal is welcome, but their reluctance to give British people the same right shows a blatant disregard for democracy.\nThis brings us to our policy announcement today. Greens believe that the people of the UK must be given an opportunity to have their say through a ratification referendum. It is a democratic requirement that when we get to the end of the negotiating process, and we see what Brexit really means as opposed to a series of promises that cannot be fulfilled, we have a chance to decide whether that it better than continued EU membership.\nTake back control was the strap line which persuaded many to vote Leave in the referendum last year. It’s now clear what that meant. A power grab by the Tory right so they can make a bonfire of regulations which protect our rights and environment; and an opportunity to hand control to powerful corporations and wealthy elites and turn us into a tax haven.\nA ratification referendum is the chance to give back control.\nIn two years time, we must give back control to the people, providing them with an opportunity to accept or reject the future that is on offer, or decide whether actually we are better off remaining a full member of the EU.\nSo on June 8th:\nVote Green to block hard Brexit.\nVote Green to have a real say on our shared future.\nVote Green to Give Back Control.",

I wasn’t looking to ‘score points’ – so I was surprised that Marvin went on the offensive and seemed to try to flip responsibility for MetroBus onto me.\n“I have consistently opposed MetroBus – in 2010 I was the only councillor to vote against the project in Full Council. I wasn’t a councillor when the project was approved; I spoke against the destruction of ‘blue finger’ land when it went through planning. I raised the issue of the MetroBus at two scrutiny meetings as well as at cabinet – without ever getting a response. I might add that three members of Marvin’s cabinet were also on scrutiny with me during the time he mentioned.”\nCouncillor Bolton challenged the project in a public forum statement in August 2014, arguing that “it seems to me that it is highly probable that we – the taxpayer – will end up footing the bill when the project becomes significantly overspent”. (see statement here)\nThe Cabinet papers discussed at the meeting showed that the increased spend on MetroBus would cause other planned transport projects to be stopped, including train station upgrades, minor traffic schemes and bus priority measures. Green councillor Carla Denyer raised this in the meeting and asked which projects would be stopped. She also queried whether any assessment had been made of the equalities impact of the cancellations, given that transport projects to improve disabled accessibility may be among the scrapped projects. However, she was told that this information was not yet available as no decisions had been made on which projects to scrap.\nLeader of the Green Group, Councillor Eleanor Combley said:\n“When the Mayor was asked questions about MetroBus, I was astonished that instead of answering them he chose to attack Councillor Bolton for supposedly not having challenged the project enough in previous years, despite the fact that Charlie has long been one of the project’s most vocal critics. The Mayor may feel we “have the tiger by the tail” and personally I agree that at this stage it makes sense for us to try to make the best possible success of MetroBus, but being committed to finish the project doesn’t mean we stop questioning, debating, trying to learn lessons for the future, or looking at alternatives like whether the Mayor could approach the West of England Combined Authority to at least partially cover this new overspend.\n“But there’s a wider issue here which is that when asked tough questions – in this case about what processes he would implement in the future – the Mayor often seeks to blame the previous administration or the person asking the question. It’s time he accepted that having been Mayor for well over a year now he has to step up and take responsibility.\nContact info:",

A licence has recently been issued to InfraStrata to drill an exploration well near Swanage in Dorset.\nThis week campaigners and a cross-party group of MPs (1) argued that fracking operators should have to take out a bond to pay for potential fracking accidents. Without this insurance the taxpayer would be at risk of paying out millions of pounds to clean up pollution and toxic waste if a company went bust.\nProfessor Molly Scott Cato, the lead Green Party candidate in the South West for next May’s European elections, said:\n“This is a classic case of privatising the profits and socialising the risks. By rejecting calls for fracking companies to take out insurance against environmental disasters, the government has confirmed our suspicions that they are happy to put the public at risk while they dish out massive tax cuts to encourage the industrialisation of our countryside. Landfill operators already have to take out this type of insurance in case things go wrong, so why should fracking companies not be subject to this simple safeguard when they risk polluting our air and water supplies?”\nWhilst the government and the shale gas industry claim strict rules are in place and that residents have nothing to be worried about, the Green Party point to a number of incidents in the USA where fracking has resulted in pollution to water, air and land. They also claim there are cleaner and greener ways to ensure energy security and reduce the costs of energy.\n“Instead of tax breaks to encourage a dash for dirty gas, we should be helping local people to insulate their homes and supporting communities to generate their own clean renewable energy. This will protect our environment, save the average person hundreds of pounds on their energy bills and create thousands of skilled green jobs”, said Dr Scott Cato.\nNotes:\n1) http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/dec/11/taxpayers-fracking-pollution-companies",

At present there is no direct link between the city’s central rail hub and most homes and businesses in the south west of the city.\nThe survey was conducted before Christmas by a team led by Cllr Tess Green, and prospective councillor Charlie Bolton (Note 2).\nThey have since talked with officials at First Bus, who accept there is a demand for bus services from BS3 to Temple Meads. However, they don’t want to re-route either the existing 24 or 25, because their new 10 minute daytime frequency with more modern buses has already attracted many more passengers to the existing service.\nFirst have however suggested that a new service might be viable if funding to kick start it can be found\nCouncillor Green said\n“I have had people come up to me on a regular basis at my street surgery and elsewhere, and the need for a bus service to Temple Meads keeps cropping up. Our survey demonstrates that this is the case. I’d like to explore opportunities to win funding to help get a service underway”\nGreen candidate for Southville, Charlie Bolton said\n“I don’t suppose anyone expects a new service to be up and running tomorrow. We see this as the start of a campaign both pre- and post-election. Support for better bus services to Temple Meads will certainly be part of my manifesto for the council elections. It is also going to be necessary to seek wider support from the area.

At time of going to press the Labour administration has not offered an explanation for the delay.\nSince 2017 the Council has explored four different schemes for a clean air zone and missed multiple government deadlines. As a result, Bristol’s air pollution is in breach of legal limits and contributes to 300 excess deaths in the city each year, and causes permanent health issues such as asthma and reduced lung function among children.\nGreen Councillor Lorraine Francis said the delay was “incredibly frustrating” and noted that those worst affected by air pollution were among those least likely to own cars. For example, over half of residents in Lawrence Hill do not own a car or van yet over 10% of deaths in the ward are attributable to air pollution.\nGreen Councillor for Eastville Lorraine Francis said:\n“It’s incredibly frustrating that the Council have now delayed action by another 9 months, despite having been required by the government to start in October this year. The data suggests that 70% of Bristolians think air quality and traffic is an issue in their areas.(4) As usual, it will be citizens in some of the most deprived and polluted areas of our city – many of whom do not own cars themselves – who bear the cost of the Council’s continued inaction, through poorer health and more early deaths.”\n“The mitigation measures which have already been announced are welcome but could have been in place years ago as they are in cities like Birmingham and Bath, which have already launched their own clean air zones. I hope that the administration can find a way to bring the launch date closer as a matter of urgency – everyone in Bristol deserves clean, breathable air.”\nGreen councillors also criticised the focus in the details released by the Council on upgrading cars rather than improving alternative transport. ‘Cleaner’ euro 6 standard cars or electric cars may have lower nitrogen dioxide emissions – the measure the Council is being ordered to meet compliance on – than diesel vehicles. However, they still contribute to road traffic clogging the city’s roads and produce particulate emissions responsible for the other half of air pollution’s health impacts. It is estimated that the health impacts from particulate matter alone cost Bristol £83m each year.\nAni Stafford-Townsend, Green councillor for Central ward said:\n“It’s five years since Council unanimously passed a Green motion to implement a clean air zone. In that time, we have seen a lot of activity from the Mayor explaining missed deadlines to Government and kicking the can down the road, but no action. This only creates uncertainty for residents and businesses and makes it harder for people to plan. From what I can see, the plans also fail to address the issue of car use itself, focusing instead on upgrading to ‘cleaner’ vehicles – but this is only tackling half of the air pollution problem, with the other half being deadly particulate pollution produced by all large road traffic.\n“The Mayor’s dithering, delay, and lack of communication is costing lives. Air quality is meant to be compliant by 2023. Can delaying implementation until summer 2022 achieve this? If so, Marvin could have taken action in 2018, and our air quality would be legally compliant by now. Instead, there have been around 1,800 premature air quality-related deaths since Marvin became Mayor. How many fewer deaths, how many fewer children growing up with asthma might have been had Marvin acted sooner?

After years of campaigning against air pollution and passing a successful council motion in 2016 which laid the foundations for the administration’s current approach, Green Councillors welcomed the item at Cabinet and called on the administration to take effective action.\nA supporting report submitted to cabinet outlines five separate options for a Clean Air Zone, including options for a charging zone on cars and other vehicles. These options will be examined in a feasibility study over the course of the year.\nGreen councillor Fi Hance, who led the Council’s clean air project during her time as a Green Cabinet Member, submitted a statement to cabinet in support of the clean air plan. She said:\n“Far too many people in our most deprived communities are suffering the ill effects of our dirty air. As the report points out, in some areas, over 1 in 10 of early deaths can be attributed to air pollution, along with many more numbers suffering from poor health. Inner city residents have lower car ownership but suffer far more health impacts from the vehicles causing illegal and harmful air – we owe them some respite from toxic air for which they are not responsible.”\nThe report submitted to cabinet notes that 72% of people in Bristol consider air pollution and traffic pollution to be ‘a problem’ or ‘a serious problem’ in their neighbourhoods and lists the known health impacts of air pollution which include low birth weight of babies, impaired lung development in small children, and acute respiratory problems and increased risk of heart disease among adults and the elderly. Air quality monitoring points around Bristol routinely record levels of air pollution far above legal limits, particularly in city centre locations such as Rupert Street, Colston Avenue and Anchor Road.\nGroup leader Councillor Eleanor Combley said:\n“It’s great to see that the Green motion, which gained cross party support in a Council meeting back in November 2016, has kept Bristol’s illegal air quality high on the Council’s agenda. As our Green Cabinet member, Fi Hance did a fantastic job chairing the Mayor’s Air Quality Working Group, developing ideas for how to tackle the issue, and I want to thank her for all the hard work that she put in to lead to these proposals. This is also a victory for the thousands of people who supported our #LetBristolBreathe campaign and signed the petition calling for action.\n“As the research shows, hundreds of lives are needlessly being cut short from dangerous levels of air pollution in Bristol, and it’s those in deprived areas of the city who are worst affected. Looking ahead, I hope the Mayor will not shy away from bold and effective action to protect the lives and health of Bristolians.”\nBackground:\n– It is a legal requirement for Bristol City Council to take action to bring air pollution levels below the legal limit as soon as possible, as noted in the cabinet report which notes that: “The City Council has been directed by Government to develop plans by 31st December 2018 to achieve compliance with the Limit Value and Objective in the shortest possible time.”\n– According to the report, the main source of nitrogen dioxide pollution in Bristol “is road traffic; with diesel cars the largest source responsible for 40% of the emissions.”\n– Green councillors have been pushing for action on clean air from the Council since as far back as 1989. In 2016 they passed a successful council motion which laid the foundations for the administration’s current work on air quality.\n– Full text of statement by Cllr Hance is below:\nStatement to Cabinet – Agenda Item 8 – Improving Public Health – A Clean Air Plan for Bristol – Cllr Fi Hance\nOn behalf of the Green group of councillors, I’d like to welcome this report which acknowledges the severity of the problem of air pollution in Bristol and the significant concern that the issue is for a many of the city’s residents. Greens in Bristol have been calling for action on this since as far back as the late 80s so it is very exciting to see plans reaching this late stage.\nFrom my time working on this in Cabinet I’m very much aware that this report reflects an enormous amount of hard work by many officers, particularly Alex Minshull and Kathy Derrick who have put in many hours, dealing with a situation in which the goalposts have not so much moved as galloped across the pitch on a number of occasions. We are fortunate to have such dedicated staff.\nWe should not forget, however, that whilst the options outlined here are significant, and will require a considerable amount of political courage to implement, they are only part of the picture. Shifting a culture of car dependency and entitlement is not easy and we must continue to lobby government for adequate resourcing to promote active travel, improved public transport and a Clean Air Act. Residents will also expect the council to be seeking strategic support from WECA to ensure more substantial and sustained investment in walking and cycling to create viable, attractive alternatives.’\nFar too many people in our most deprived communities are suffering the ill effects of our dirty air. As the report points out, in some areas, over 1 in 10 of early deaths can be attributed to air pollution, along with many more numbers suffering from poor health. Inner city residents have lower car ownership but suffer far more health impacts from the vehicles causing illegal and harmful air – we owe them some respite from toxic air for which they are not responsible.

As lockdown restrictions eased, businesses such as those in Clifton’s Princess Victoria Street sought to reopen by providing seating in this extra space available. However in July Green councillor Paula O’Rourke revealed that the Council is charging local businesses for using the empty parking bays – to the tune of at least £7000 per year. Following complaints from businesses in her ward Councillor O’Rourke urged the Mayor to look into the issue as a matter of urgency, and secured a promise from Marvin Rees to consider delaying the charges. (1) Local businesses have warned the charges could make the difference between remaining open and being forced to close.\nSylvie Dagallier, landlord of the Bristol Fringe bar and venue, said:\n“To secure social distancing, outside areas are essential as the Bristol Fringe has a very small internal footprint. I have lost all my trade as there is no live music anymore – the outside area is my only realistic trading area these days. However to be charged £40 a day for the use of the space is not financially feasible.”\nNow Green councillors are backing a petition calling on the council to suspend trading charges wherever parking bays have been suspended until at least September 2021. The petition (https://you.38degrees.org.uk/petitions/suspend-bristol-street-trading-charges-during-covid) currently has over 800 signatures – if it reaches the Council’s threshold of 3,500 it will go to a debate at the September Council meeting.\nClifton Green Councillor Jerome Thomas said: “I know the council faces some tough budget decisions due to Coronavirus but these street trading charges won’t generate significant sums of money for the Council, and they will be a hammer blow to local businesses trying to open up again as we emerge from lockdown.”\nPaula said: “I’ve spent the best part of the summer working with local businesses and council officers about these changes and trying to sort things out. Local businesses are simply trying to adapt to the Council’s street changes and provide space for customers in the street now that car parking spaces have been removed. They shouldn’t be punished for doing the right thing.\nShe added:\n“The Mayor has talked a lot about the threat to business and the harm caused to the economy by lockdown – now he has the chance to back his words up with action by throwing local businesses a lifeline. Bristol can ‘build back better’ out of lockdown and have thriving streets that work for everyone, but the Council has to play its part to make that work.”\nNotes\n– Image: Councillor O’Rourke with Richard Davis, chair of Clifton BID (Business Improvement District)\n1) Bristol Post 15 July 2020 – Mayor promises to consider delaying parking bay suspension fees for pubs and cafés (https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/mayor-promises-consider-delaying-parking-4328467)",
  "https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_/https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_forum-is-free-housing/content_904.html": "First on the panel to speak was Oona Goldsworthy, Chief Executive of United Communities Housing Association. Oona described the current shocking situation in Bristol West where the average person spends 40% of income on rent, and 200-300 people apply for each house that UCHA offers. The Homes for Britain campaign is fighting back, uniting housing federations, trade unions and charities, such as Shelter and Crisis, in common interest of affordable homes. Oona highlighted availability of land as key, calling upon Bristol City Council as a major landowner to act. She argued for faster, intensive house-building, and the use of cost-effective solutions like retro-fitting.\nMike Roberts, of Happiness Architecture Beauty a development company that works with Kevin McCloud was next up, offering a contrasting vision of quality over quantity. Mike argued that the built environment is key to health and happiness. He explained how HAB crowdfunded £2 million enabling it to create custom-build houses, giving people real choice. He compelled us to look beyond buildings to the communities and collective possiblities they create, for example car sharing, reducing personal and environmental costs. Like Oona, Mike called on the public sector to lead in setting standards, rather than seeing land as an asset to be stripped of value.\nBristol Community Land Trust’s Keith Cowling then gave a personal account of their journey to build 12 houses in Bristol. BCLT acquired funding four years ago, yet the council offered them only one decent site in two years. Keith argued the government ‘willed the ends without willing the means’, championing localism and the right to build, yet doing little to actually empower community groups. BCLT was ultimately subjected to endless delays, having to become a registered provider and wade through compliance to draw down government funds. Despite the difficulties Keith is optimistic, hoping to mobilise young people to build their own homes. In the meantime he awaits the all clear so BCLT can finally get on site at Fishponds Road and crack on building 12 affordable houses.\nThe final speaker, Shankari ‘Shanks’ Raj Edgar, Founding Director of Nudge architecture and design group, described how she strives to create beautiful spaces whilst adding social value. Projects have included Temple Studios, the Engine Shed and a temporary jungle and tree house erected for OVO Energy. Shanks highlighted the interconnectedness of social wellbeing, environment and economy, and the detrimental effect of over-valuing GDP. Like the other panellists Shanks saw an important role for the public sector in building affordable homes and regulating rents. On an international level she argued we should work closely with the EU. She finished by expressing the urgent need to engage children in environmental issues from an early age.\nAfter the speakers, Jackson Moulding of Ecomotive, called upon the audience to make themselves aware that Bristol City Council is currently assessing Bristol’s housing needs for the next twenty years. He urged people to register their interest on the council website so that it can become a people-led process.\nThis provoked discussion on the current hammering that local councils are taking, and the need to calculate the savings that more affordable housing could make. The council and the private sector need to work together to hit objectives yet still create value.\nAn ex-Bristol City Council worker in the audience claimed controversially that there simply is not enough land in Bristol to keep up with demand. This was challenged by the claim that Bristol owns more of its land than any other local authority in Britain. Others argued the council needs to innovate, utilising high-density spaces, building up not sprawling out.\nAudience questions raised numerous interesting points: examples of European countries with affordable housing markets; the value of creating homes for life; the definition of affordable housing; and how homes link to permaculture and the reintroduction of biodiversity into our ecosystem.\nOne young man criticised the dereliction of the Carriageworks, neglected for over 25 years. Darren argued for a devolution agenda that would enable the Carriageworks to become a genuinely community led development. To add action to this assertion the room was informed there were Carriageworks re-development objection forms available to fill in after the talk.\nThe next Forum is Free will host Bristol’s Big Transport Debate at the Arnolfini on the 2nd of April at 7.30pm. Come and join us! A full list of Darren’s upcoming events and hustings can be found here.",
  "https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_/https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_news_climate-change_fly-tipping_flooding/content_324.html": "menu\nGreen councillors have submitted an amendment to next week’s budget which funds practical measures to address a wide range of challenges in Bristol, both local and city-wide.\nProposals include a scheme dubbed the “puddle police” which identifies problem drains across the city to reduce local flooding, tougher enforcement action on fly-tipping, and development of a 12 year plan to make Bristol carbon neutral by 2030.\nThe proposals would be paid for by cracking down on commercial landlords whose buildings do not meet the requirements on energy efficiency. The additional fines would then be used to fund improvements across the city and would further encourage commercial landlords to reduce the energy lost from their buildings.\nCouncillor Clive Stevens who developed the plans for reducing local flooding said:\n“I hope Labour don’t get wet feet over voting for this amendment. We all know the spots that are subject to local flooding and its often the same drains that end up blocked every year, whether from leaves, litter or local debris. My colleagues have nicknamed this initiative the “puddle police”. It’s not so much a police force, more of a puddle watch. Residents report those gullies and drains that always block and Bristol Waste Company will have some money to clear them out before they flood. Simple, but effective.”\nExplaining the plans for tougher action on fly-tipping Councillor Stevens continued:\n“The Green amendment will enable tougher action on fly-tipping which has become the scourge of some areas in Bristol. With the money raised, the Council will be able to afford extra staff to check vehicle movement around the time fly-tipping occurred. This will then mean that more penalty notices can be issued to those dumping waste on our streets and neighbourhoods.”\nThe amendment also provides funding to help Bristol meet its commitment to become carbon neutral by 2030, including developing the city’s 12 year action plan and funding for small community energy generation and energy efficiency schemes. Councillor Eleanor Combley, who is part of the cross-party group working to implement Bristol carbon neutral 2030 said:\n“Councillors from all parties supported our call to declare a climate emergency and set the ambitious target of a Carbon Neutral Bristol by 2030. Saying the words is one thing, but the proposals in this amendment will help us start putting that commitment into action, so I hope that councillors from all parties will put money where their mouth is and support it.”\nCouncillor Jerome Thomas, who developed the funding plan for the schemes concluded saying:\n“This is a win-win-win for Bristol. It brings in money from commercial landlords who are breaking energy efficiency regulations and uses it to fund climate change adaptation, stop fly-tipping and tackle local flooding. The council is already working with residential landlords to improve their energy efficiency and now it’s time for commercial landlords to up their game. Heating buildings generates 17% of total UK carbon emissions, so we must insulate our draughty office and commercial buildings to as soon as possible if we are to reduce Bristol’s carbon footprint. If other parties support this amendment we can reduce the city’s carbon emissions, make Bristol’s offices more affordable to heat, and raise money to further the city’s ambition to become carbon neutral all at the same time.”\nImage: David Morris: https://www.flickr.com/photos/46124960@N00/199058346/in/photostream/\nNotes\nThe full budget amendment can be found on p12 here: https://democracy.bristol.gov.uk/documents/b11659/Budget%20Amendments%20Received%2026th-Feb-2019%2014.00%20Full%20Council.pdf?T=9\nMinimum Energy Efficiency Standard\nThe Minimum Energy Efficiency Standard (MEES) Regulations are designed to promote more energy efficient buildings. The regulations allow councils to impose financial penalties on residential and commercial landlords when they rent out buildings which have an Energy Performance Rating of below E. By encouraging landlords to make their buildings more energy efficient this reduces carbon emissions and makes homes and commercial properties more affordable to heat. Bristol city council is already working with residential landlords to improve their properties though the MEES regulations, but has yet to do so with commercial landlords. By working with the new powers that they have to impose financial penalties, the Council get a win-win-win result. It can reduce the city’s carbon emissions, make homes and offices more affordable to heat, and raise money to further the city’s ambition to become carbon neutral.”\nThe Minimum Energy Efficiency Standard (MEES) was introduced in March 2015 by the Energy Efficiency (Private Rented Property)(England and Wales) Regulations 2015. This means that landlords of residential and commercial properties within the scope of the MEES Regulations (nearly all privately rented property) must not renew existing tenancies or grant new tenancies in the building has less than the minimum energy efficiency performance certificate (EPC) of E unless the landlord registers an exemption, for which they must have a valid reason. Only a small proportion of properties would be entitled to an exemption. The MEES Regulations allow Bristol City Council and other councils to impose quite significant penalties where the regulations are not being adhered to. This will help BCC ensure that landlords improve the city’s buildings so that they become more energy efficient, helping the city move towards its goal of carbon neutrality by 2030 and at the same time will also raise revenue for the city.\nResidential MEES and Bristol City Council\nThe landlord licensing team has been progressing the application of the MEES Regulations and has been given Government funding for a pilot project to do this. Bristol is seen as being quite far advanced among local authorities in its application of the MEES Regulations. The landlord licensing team believe that there are between 800 and 1500 properties that could be affected by the application of the regulations and it is preparing to engage with the owners of these properties in the next few months.\nCommercial properties MEES\nThe Government estimates that 18% of commercial property lettings fall below an EPC rating of E (source Burges Salmon guide to MEES Regulations). The MEES Regulations allow local authorities to impose penalties up to 20% of the value of the property’s rateable value on commercial landlords with a maximum fine per property of up to £150,000 per property. While in theory this is likely to raise millions of pounds of revenue for the Council, our budget we are only assuming £150,000 net income in the first year of operation and £500,000 per year thereafter. We should either recruit a project manager (under the supervision of our commercialisation team) to introduce the same financial penalties system that our landlord licensing team have already undertaken in the residential sector OR we should work with a private sector partner who takes a percentage cut of the fees generated from financial penalties. Either approach is likely to result in income generation from year 1.",

The deal was agreed by the outgoing Commission in September and offers a strike price for electricity of £92.50 per MWh – roughly twice the current wholesale price – as well as a state credit guarantee of at least £10bn.\nDr Scott Cato said the meeting with Commissioner Vestager was an important opportunity to make representations on behalf of the many businesses in the South West that will be hit by the unfair competition the deal represents, and her many constituents who oppose Hinkley C. Molly said:\n“I wanted a clearer understanding of Commissioner Vestager’s position on nuclear and Hinkley in particular and to establish how and whether decisions taken by the previous Commission can be challenged.”\nThe Austrian government and others are currently threatening a legal challenge over the decision, believing it to be in breach of EU competition and state aid rules. Dr Scott Cato said:\n“I want the EU to adhere to its own rules on competition. We should not have to resort to lengthy, expensive and potentially embittered legal challenges that will be expensive and could create tension between member states.”\nGreens believe that the South West has enormous potential for generation of electricity via wind, tidal, wave, solar and geothermal sources and that the Hinkley deal represents unfair competition against renewable energy generators.\nA recent progress report by RegenSW [2] highlighted that the South West now generates enough renewable electricity to power over one quarter of all homes. The capacity of renewable electricity in the South West has grown by 37% and the region now generates 8.3% of its electricity from renewables. The Progress Report also shows the South West leads the way in small and community scale renewables with 21 per cent of projects receiving the Feed-in Tariff, more than any other UK region. Dr Scott Cato concluded:\n“I hope I have managed to convince Commissioner Vestager of the enormous economic and environmental opportunities that renewables offers the South West. I am hopeful that we will yet be able to save energy innovation in our region and prevent the excessive energy bills that nuclear threatens to land UK citizens with.”\nNotes:\n[1] The new Competition Commissioner is Margrethe Vestager: http://ec.europa.eu/commission/2014-2019/vestager_en\n[2] http://regensw.s3.amazonaws.com/progressreport_2014_web_26a4646ced906a17.pdf\nRecently elected Molly Scott Cato is the first elected Green MEP for the South West of England and Gibraltar and is one of 50 Green/EFA MEPs in the European Parliament.

  "https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_/https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_greater-ambition-on-tackling-climate-change-needed-say-greens/content_1011.html": "menu\nAs winter storms and floods continue to affect the region, South West Green Party are joining Greens in Europe in calling for more ambitious European targets on CO2 emissions, renewable energy generation and energy efficiency.\nAfter lengthy discussions the European Commission has put forward Europe- wide targets on tackling climate change that include a 40% cut in greenhouse gas emissions and 27% of energy generation from renewable sources by 2030, based on 1990 levels [1].\nProfessor Molly Scott Cato, who is campaigning to be elected to the European Parliament in May as the South West’s first Green MEP, says the targets put forward by the European Commission to tackle climate change must be more ambitious and should include a target on improving energy efficiency, which is being demanded by the Green Group in the European Parliament.\n“These targets just don’t go far enough. Greens believe we need to reduce CO2 emissions by at least 60% by 2030 – and to do that we’ll need to generate at least 45% of our electricity from renewable sources like wind, solar and tidal. Most disappointing of all is the absence of the single measure that would do most to cut domestic energy bills, tackle climate change and create jobs all at the same time – improving insulation in the UK’s housing stock. Even the Boss of NPower, the company, ironically, that lobbied government to reduce green levies used to insulate homes, has admitted that high energy bills in the UK are largely due to leaky and draughty housing stock [2].”\nDr Scott Cato believes that the winter weather witnessed this year in the South West demonstrates the urgency of tackling climate change, locally, nationally and internationally.\n“The storms and floods affecting the region this winter are examples of weather, not climate. However, the increasing severity of extreme weather events throughout the world is precisely what climate scientists have been predicting for decades. We also know that sea levels are rising and that this will make storm surges far more damaging.\n“At the local level we need to move towards farming methods that are carbon neutral or even carbon negative. For example, pasture acts to ‘sink’ carbon in the ground while also reducing the need for imported animal feed and growing food crops for local markets cuts out unnecessary long distance transport. Planting more trees is also a natural and quick way of capturing carbon from the atmosphere and trees also act as natural flood defences.\n“At national level we need a rapid expansion in the country’s capacity for renewable energy generation. A simplified feed in tariff mechanism that clearly gives higher rates for electricity generated by all community owned installations would help. In Germany and Denmark this policy has resulted in a rapid expansion of renewable capacity owned by communities, bringing them huge economic benefit”.\nThe proposals on tackling climate change put forward by the European Commission will be considered by MEPs in the European Parliament next month when Greens will continue to press for more ambitious targets.\nNotes:\n[1] Guardian article: EU to cut carbon emissions by 40% by 2030\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jan/22/eu-carbon-emissions-climate-deal-2030\n[2] NPower boss talking on BBC Radio 4 Today Programme 22.01.14 http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03q96bz 1.32 minutes in",

We promise to work hard for you and represent you (whether you voted for us or not!). Our priorities for the next 4 years are:\nWe are aware of plans to use the location of Blake Centre on Gainsborough Square as a meanwhile site and understand this will be subject to planning; we’ve not yet seen the planning application.\nWe have a housing crisis in Bristol, which results in many people, especially young people, struggling and turning to unconventional housing options. We have deep sympathy for those in insecure and inappropriate accommodation. With rents for a single room in a shared house in Lockleaze starting at £800 per month and the Government having no legal responsibility to house single people, there are few options for people on low incomes.\nWe support the use of and creation of more ‘meanwhile’ sites to provide safer places for people to live in their vans. Ultimately, we need to provide appropriate housing and measures such as rent controls so everyone can afford somewhere safe and decent to live.\nResidents will have an opportunity to ask questions and raise concerns with the meanwhile team (meanwhile.sites@bristol.gov.uk), and as councillors, we will also be doing this. There will also be a process for commenting on the planning application; this is not yet live, but we will share when it is. We have already raised concerns about nearby residents’ properties and the security of the site and hope this will be considered appropriately. Toilet and waste facilities will be provided on-site.\nDeadline for the consultation is 13th March, we strongly encourage you to submit your views here:\nhttps://www.ask.bristol.gov.uk/cameron-centre-consultation\nAs your local councillors we have been in negotiations between council officers, cabinet members, the Mayors officer, Lockleaze Neighbourhood Trust and residents to get the best deal possible for the community.\nWe hope changes will be made to the current plans being consulted on. Here are our comments on the proposed plans.\nWe support affordable housing, especially housing which meets the needs of the local community, will be included in the Lockleaze lettings policy, and is wheelchair accessible.\nHowever, we’re also very aware of the numbers of houses being built in an area which currently has very few amenities, and where services are already under great pressure. The health centre does not have capacity for all of the extra residents, and there are already significant issues with dentists. Lockleaze has no café, pub or any venue for people to just spend time and socialise. The Lockleaze estate doesn’t even have a proper supermarket. We cannot just keep building houses without providing space for all these other necessary services.\nLockleaze Neighbourhood Trust provides an invaluable service to the community, providing a weekly community café/lunch, coordinating warm spaces, hosting many, many community groups, supporting the residents planning group, and much, much more. We welcome the commitment to community asset transfer the community space in this development to LNT, but thus far the council have not committed to providing adequate space. We support LNT’s plan to run a nursery for the local community. We are facing a child care crisis, with 2/3rds of UK women saying lack of childcare impacts their career progression.\nWe would like to see 450msq committed to community space. Plans for a nursery would require outside space connected to the indoor nursery space. We would not be happy to see secure bike parking space removed in the development.\nWe are keen that residents views about a library service are considered, particularly around providing access later in the day, study and computer space and think there is a real opportunity for the council to work closely with Lockleaze Neighbourhood Trust to deliver community needs if they are included as development partners in the project.\nWe have heard concerns from residents about the appearance of the designs, and would like to see a more aspirational design.\nOne for Purdown Open Space – 10 new feature trees\nAnd for Lockleaze Open Space – behind the Lockleaze Family Club. Four new feature trees.\nPlease email your thoughts to onetreeperchild@bristol.gov.uk\nLocal councillors, Heather and David, have been successful in securing money from the community infrastructure fund for two Lockleaze projects this year.\nThe Vench will receive funding for floodlights for their sports pitch. The Vench is an amazing project supporting children and young people in Lockleaze, so we are thrilled to support them.\nMoney was also secured to improve walking routes across South Purdown to connect the area around Elmcroft Crescent with Glenfrome Primary school and the surrounding area.\nHeather and David invited Mark Shelford, the Avon and Somerset Police and Crime Commissioner, to visit Lockleaze to discuss a top concern among residents – road safety and youth provision.\nThe police chief promised more visits from the speed camera van and to work with the councillors to reduce speeding in Lockleaze. He said that plans for the Stottbury and Rousham Roads traffic calming scheme were due to be made final so that work could begin soon.\nHeather and David are working with the Vench and other youth service providers to get more funding and facilities for young people in Lockleaze.\nAs your local councillors we are working with police and local youth workers to monitor local anti-social behaviour, and take action/provide support where needed. Although many reports are repeated on social media, Lockleaze does not have a significantly high rate of youth anti-social behaviour or violent crime, and we should all be careful not to vilify any group of people on social media.\nThe Lockleaze Youth & Play Partnership, which includes The Vench, CYN, local schools, Bristol City Council, Children’s Centre and Police, meet on a regular basis to discuss provision for children and young people aged 0-18 years in the area. Together they are working with the BCC families in focus team to develop contextual safeguarding agreement – a document to link all organisation working on this together to ensure support and provision are as effective as possible within our stretched funding streams. We are looking at increasing the provision of youth work in the area, but often the funding we have for other projects (E.G. a playground) is not suitable because it is one off funding for a physical project.\nWe are working with The Vench to get more funding for Youth Workers in the area – it is this rather than more spaces/physical infrastructure that is needed.\nWe are talking to the police and community development workers about hosting a public meeting to discuss the issues. Get in touch or watch this space to find out more.\nThe Vench, Creative Youth Network and St James’ Church are looking for Volunteer Youth Mentors to increase capacity to support young people, please get in touch with us if you would like to find out more.\nWe are thrilled to have secured almost £100,000 of funding for a playground in South Lockleaze, where there was a really lack of playground provision. We have been consulting with local residents for around 6 weeks and have concluded the Elmcroft/Muller Road location is the best option.\nThanks to everyone who responded to the consultation. We had a good number of responses from a variety of local residents, many with children who would use the facility. Responses were well split between communities near each site.\n54% of respondents showed a preference for the Elmcroft/Muller Road site, 31% for the Heyford site and 15% showed no preference. Based on this, and the numerous comments – we will ask the Council’s parks team to move forwards with the planned Muller Road Site. There is still a long road to go as we need to secure another £85,000 in matched funding – which we can now apply for.\nFAQ’s\nWhy were only these options proposed?\nThere are many considerations to be taken into account for a new playground. Firstly, the request for a new playground came mostly from residents in the Shaldon Road area – so it needed to be accessible from there. Secondly, there are often issues which prevent use of a certain site, like underground cables/pipes, or flooding. And we also needed a site that was reasonably overlooked and visible in order to stop vandalism.\nWhy wasn’t a formal consultation run?\nThe council has a legal obligation to consult on certain decisions, such as road changes and major developments. A new playground does not fall into this category so the Council provided no funding or resource for a formal consultation. Ultimately the location decision was left to us, as your local councillors. We thought it was important to consult the community, so we have chosen to put our own resources and effort into that, we hand delivered letters to many of the local streets, posted on social media and knocked on doors to hear people’s views.\nWhy did we not propose a location covering the Lockleaze estate?\nWe are elected to represent Lockleaze ward – which covers the area of Eastville West of the M32, and the area around Fairfield School. As part of the Council’s Parks and Green spaces strategy Bristol has a max walking distance any residential street should be from a playground – and this area around Muller Road/Shaldon Road is the part of Lockleaze furthest from a playground. We are also pushing for (and hopeful) that there will be a playground in the new Dovercourt development, to cover that area.\nIs the air quality by Muller Road dangerous?\nWe have walked around the area with an air quality monitor at various times in the afternoon/evening to measure the worst air quality, and all readings were within the ‘good’ category – apart from high pollen when we were near tree blossom.\nConclusion\nUltimately there are a lot of compromises to be made, between cost, accessibility and which parts of Lockleaze will be closest to the playground. The Muller rd location was the most popular location, seems to be the best spot, and a new playground will be a fantastic asset for many young families on the nearby streets.\nSpeaking to parents in the area I heard that most currently drive their children to a playground. This has negative impacts on the environment, on local traffic and air quality, and children’s health, as the worst air quality is often inside a car sat in traffic. So I am thrilled that we have managed to secure this new playground for Lockleaze, and can’t wait for it to open and improve quality of life for many families and children in the area.\nTree planting in Lockleaze Open Space\nWe had an excellent turnout for a tree planting session in Lockleaze Open Space by the Purdown Tower.\nTrees are being planted as part of the One Tree Per Child Scheme.\nMore dates are planned in the future – come out and get muddy for a good cause!\nNew Playground Coming\nYour local Green councillors successfully gained nearly £90,000 funding for a new playground in Lockleaze. In an area committee meeting of councillors from surrounding wards, Heather and David successfully secured around 2/3rds of the overall Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) funding for Lockleaze.

The city has a long and proud tradition of scientific leadership and is the world’s largest hub for wildlife film making. The fact that Bristol plays host to a great deal of environmental innovation and jobs was key to Bristol being selected as European Green Capital.\n“Like many others, I am therefore disturbed by the recent denigration of science and expertise in our own country and particularly in the US. It is through scientific research that we have been alerted to some of the most serious environmental crises confronting us from climate change to air pollution and the impact of chemical farming on wildlife.\n“My political work would be impossible without the information and data that rigorous scientific research provides. Indeed, my role as a politician involves making calculated judgements based on that scientific knowledge.\n“The number of international students applying to study in the UK has fallen since Brexit, with many saying it is now less welcoming. This not only impacts on the UK now with the loss of these students and the benefits they bring, but could mean in the longer term they are less likely to come to carry out postgraduate research in the UK once they have graduated.”\n“We need to defend the role of an independent and pluralistic scientific community and ensure that science in Bristol and throughout the UK is properly funded after we withdraw from the EU. The alarm has already been raised about the threat to the UK scientific research community from Brexit, an issue I have raised with Minister of State for Universities and Science, Jo Johnson. As Greens we will hold this government to account on their promise of making as much funding available to universities as they have received from the EU.”",

While it is always important to learn lessons for the future, this review firmly puts to bed any controversy or questions about the success of Bristol’s year as European Green Capital. It states “it is impossible to reach any other conclusion than that Bristol 2015 Ltd performed well and the Green Capital year was a considerable success.”\nMolly Scott Cato, Green MEP for Bristol said:\n“This well-evidenced report shows increased levels of engagement in environmental issues, increased visitor numbers to the city and many small organisations benefitting from grant funding. The report also highlights some challenges, in particular the question of how to increase the involvement of BAME and other under-represented communities in environmental issues. So while we should of course celebrate the success of Bristol Green Capital, its legacy must be to increase the involvement of marginalised communities across the city.”\nLeader of the Green Councillor Group, Charlie Bolton said:\n“Clearly, Green Capital year lasted for a year – and this isn’t a long enough period of time to have a major impact on long term environmental issues such as combatting climate change or improving air quality. It is worth noting, however, that the year saw the production of the ‘mini-Stern report’ (2) which gives details on how to make major CO2 reductions within Bristol. We now need to focus on implementing the recommendations in this report.”\nCouncillor Fodor concluded:\n“Bristol’s year as European Green Capital led to many Bristolians being involved in Green issues for the first time and has put Bristol on the world stage. For example the ‘91 Ways’ project involved all 91 languages in the city, 30,000 school pupils participated in using ground-breaking environmental educational material now available worldwide, and food growing projects were held in every postcode across the city (3).

Of course, action to reduce plastic waste is welcome, but this provides a useful diversion from the many government policies that are trashing the environment. In particular the £5bn in subsidies to fossil fuels since 2010 and kick-starting a whole new fossil industry in fracking.\n“I am tired of the Tories putting on environmental clothes to counter their nasty party image. They pick some low-hanging fruit – measures which are easy and popular such as a ban on the ivory trade and banning bee-killing pesticides – while continuing to spend billions on more roads and expanding airports.\n“Theresa May’s speech confirms that the Tories have trouble seeing the wood for the trees. What we need is systemic changes and an Environment Act that provides legally enforceable timelines and milestones. Instead, we get more greenwash to appease the Daily Mail. Fundamentally, we need to shift the focus of the economy away from endless growth and pointless consumption towards ensuring everybody has a decent, happy and meaningful life.\n“To push for the bold green changes we need, rather than the insipid hint of green offered by the Tories today, requires greater Green representation at Westminster. In that sense perhaps the greenest move of all would be to reform our archaic voting system; to introduce a fair proportional system that would enable more green MPs to be elected to support and build on the excellent work of Caroline Lucas.”",

Councillors are being asked to approve the development plans for the factory, despite the plans including no affordable housing. The developers, Generator South West, argue that to include affordable housing would make the scheme unviable, and the council may face legal action if councillors turn the application down.\nCouncillor Charlie Bolton said:\n“Having no affordable housing included in the Chocolate Factory development is utterly appalling. We live in a city with desperate housing problems – increasing levels of homelessness, a private rented sector with rents which are far too high, and too many abuses of the power that landlords have – we need to build as many genuinely affordable homes as we can.”\n“So for a planning application to come forward – and it is not the first – with zero affordable housing is quite unacceptable. It goes against everything we believe in. It is quite simply an attack on the poorest in the city.”\n“I feel sorry for councillors who have to sit on planning committees when government leaves them such little power to enforce the council’s own affordable housing target of 30-40%. Government legislation hands over power to the developer, who can too easily justify building no affordable homes by saying it will prevent the development making enough money. Greens are calling for the viability assessments upon which claims are based to be made publicly available, and for the council to be given more power to insist building affordable houses are part of new developments wherever possible.”",

The accusation follows new projections from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) which estimates onshore wind and solar will be as cheap or cheaper than gas by 2020. BEIS now acknowledge an increased role for renewables, particularly due to potential improvements in battery storage. Molly said:\n“Having hammered the renewables sector for ideological reasons, the government now discovers that wind and solar are set to become the cheapest ways to generate electricity.\n“Government energy policy supposedly seeks to deliver secure, affordable and low carbon energy. They have failed on all three counts. But in particular we now see that by failing to pursue a transition to renewable energy they have missed the opportunity to provide electricity for the consumer at the lowest cost.”\nTwo years ago, Dr Scott Cato commissioned a report which concluded that the South West could generate over 100% of its energy needs from a mix of renewable sources and create 122,000 new jobs through a renewable energy transition.

Full Council voted for a motion1 put forward by Green Party councillors at tonight’s Full Council meeting. A petition and many statements from the public were also tabled in support of the motion, which calls for Bristol City Council to take the lead in calling for the fund to develop a strategy to divest from fossil fuels. Bristol City Council and its neighbouring authorities have seats on the Avon Pension Fund Committee, in which Council employees’ pensions are invested.\nGreen Councillor for Redland, Martin Fodor who tabled the motion said:\n“I am delighted that the council will be taking a lead in calling for Avon Pension fund to become ‘fossil free’ and diversify into renewables and energy efficiency. We are proud of the Council’s commitment earlier this year not to invest in any fossil fuel industries2, and it’s now time for our pension funds to follow suit.”\n“There is a growing realisation that divesting from fossil fuels is not just good for the environment, it is a sound financial judgement too. Investment in the fossil fuel industry is increasingly risky given that the sector is likely to fall in value – sooner rather than later. This is a view shared by Mark Carney, Government of the Bank of England3 and Sir Nicholas Stern, former Chief economist of the World Bank. 75% of fossil fuels need to stay in the ground to avoid dangerous climate change4. This means that fossil fuel industries are not only causing untold damage, but are on the way out and now is the time to invest in alternatives.”\nMark Hubbard chair of Bristol UNISON, who recently voted to support fossil free pensions said:\n“Bristol UNISON has 5,000 members working in Bristol City Council and hundreds of community organisations. Our members want their pension investments to be green and sustainable.”\nGreen Councillor for Clifton East, Carla Denyer, who has also been actively campaigning to get the University of Bristol to go fossil free5, including tabling a motion to the University’s governance body said:\n“Divesting from fossil fuels is good for the environment and also good for all of us who want a safe and secure pension in the future.

These are sensible, effective amendments that will reduce some of the impact of the deep cuts in Labour’s austerity budget, protect vital emergency funding for some of the poorest people in the city, and provide housing in the City for children in care with complex needs. While it is disappointing that councillors did not support all of our amendments, voting down the amendment to scrap free car parking for councillors, it is encouraging that most of our proposals have passed today.\n“This shows the value of having Green councillors in the room to propose alternatives, and with Labour taking their lead from us, this hopefully represents the start of more open thinking and cross-party working from the Mayor. The traditional tribal political games so often played by the main three parties benefits nobody but politicians.”\nBackground:\nThe amendment is to hire a planner to do research to develop policies to ensure a more balanced mix of housing types across the city, in particular to stem the rate of conversion of family homes to Houses in Multiple Occupation, which includes student lets exempt from Council tax. Last year Bristol City Council missed out on approximately £13m worth of council tax from properties that had been converted into student lets. Hiring a planner at a one off-cost of roughly £25,000 (assuming 6 months work) would support the council to act on its recent press release (https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/council-take-control-student-housing-1236284) promoting changes in the authority’s Local Plan.\nResponding to the outcome of the vote, Councillor Clive Stevens, who proposed the amendment, said:\n“I’m delighted my budget amendment on this has passed.

Full text below:\nNormal\n0\nfalse\nfalse\nfalse\nEN-GB\nX-NONE\nX-NONE\nMicrosoftInternetExplorer4\nI don’t really like being in opposition, I didn’t come into politics for the fighting and the tit-for-tat. I came into politics because I was attracted to the idea of working together for the common good. And, as Greens, we have managed some of that in the two years I’ve been a councillor. We have seconded motions proposed by other parties, and invited members of other parties to second ours, or even co-wrote them. We have contributed in cabinet, as long as we were allowed. We have proposed helpful amendments to the budget, which were so sensible, so unarguable, so financially sound, that they received full cross-party support.\nAnd that’s the kind of spirit we need to move this city towards a positive vision of the future. Because Bristol can be a place where all of us can live healthier, happier lives, in communities strong enough and resilient enough to weather the global storms (both literal and metaphorical).\nHowever, sometimes I do have to react to what is put in front of me. We’ve heard a lot of beautiful words today, we keep hearing a lot of beautiful words, but the gulf between those words and the reality of the actions I see, and what people around me experience, is so huge that I can’t be silent. I find myself like the child in the nursery story who just can’t help blurting out that the emperor isn’t quite as well-dressed as he thinks and I can’t keep myself from speaking out.\nWords like respect, care, grace, jar with actions like firing people who have worked with you and for you for years without even having the decency to speak to them yourself.\nWords like collaborative suggest a willingness to ask for other perspectives and respect different opinions. They don’t sit well with harsh public criticism the instant your colleagues don’t come to the conclusion you want.\nI hear words like wellbeing, then see the city thrown at the mercy of investors, who are invited to build high rises to maximise the return on their investment, and further inflate local rents and house prices, regardless of whether the people of Bristol actually prefer their city’s wide open and distinctive views and want homes that are built to live well in, as part of a community.\nThe talk of enabling and working with citizens, is not reflected in simultaneously dumping more work on volunteers to fill the gaps in what you aren’t willing to fund, and at the same time pulling the rug out from under their feet by withdrawing any support or cooperation that used to be given from the council side.\nHow can we square the claim that this administration is delivering for the city, when their eagerness to review everything done by the previous administration means that, for example, the whole highways department is so busy chasing their tails that no community can get a road safety sign put up or a double yellow line painted around a corner?\nSometimes it feels like the words take priority over the reality, so that it becomes more important that you can put on your election leaflets that you have kept the Children’s Centres open than to actually safeguard the services they provide. So you end up keeping them open as buildings maybe, but with jobs and services cut to the point that they are not necessarily really Children’s Centres any more.\nThis city needs more than words.\nThis city needs openness and transparency, a genuine commitment to a democracy that gives people a real say in the decisions that affect their lives. Opening up your plans to scrutiny and possibly criticism can be hard, but it does lead to better decisions.\nThis city needs urgent action on air quality, on achieving environmental sustainability, and on making real steps to mitigate and adapt to climate change. That requires not only the willingness to listen to all the evidence, but also the courage to then stand up and lead when it is clear where the evidence points.\nThis city needs planning and transport design that looks to the future, and doesn’t assume everyone driving around in private cars, with the social separation and the huge waste of resources and space that entails, is the only way things can be forever.\nThis city needs a commitment to social justice and community that doesn’t run and hide at the first sign of lobbying from commercial interests.\nWe know that times are hard and money is short and that many of the challenges facing the city, from the rise in homelessness to the crisis in our mental health, have bigger, broader causes than the actions of the city council, but that doesn’t excuse us from doing what we can. If our ability to act is limited, it strengthens the need for every decision to be a move in the right direction. If the challenges facing us are complex and far reaching, all the more reason to include the dissenting voices that help us to build a richer picture. If we are serious about building a better Bristol for all our futures it is going to take more than fine words to get us there, we need actions that live up to them.\n/* Style Definitions */\ntable.MsoNormalTable\n{mso-style-name:”Table Normal”;\nmso-tstyle-rowband-size:0;\nmso-tstyle-colband-size:0;\nmso-style-noshow:yes;\nmso-style-priority:99;\nmso-style-parent:””;\nmso-padding-alt:0cm 5.4pt 0cm 5.4pt;\nmso-para-margin:0cm;\nmso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt;\nmso-pagination:widow-orphan;\nfont-size:10.0pt;\nfont-family:”Times New Roman”,”serif”;}",

In particular we have to find solutions to manage open green spaces and continue to work for the wellbeing of young people any adults within the community.”\nSharmila Bousa, newly elected candidate for Bristol North West commented,\n“I’m pleased to have been selected to represent the Green Party in Bristol North West. It’s a privilege to represent the party in such a diverse part of this great city. It’s an exciting time for the Green Party and I feel we could make some real in roads in this constituency. I will be focusing on hitting the ground running and listening to what issues concern people most. Key priorities such as affordable housing, rental regulation and regeneration of local high streets and support for local businesses through improvement of public transport links rank high on my list of priorities.”\nThe candidate for Bristol West and the city’s current MEP, Molly Scott Cato said,\n“I am honoured to have been trusted by Bristol Green Party to fight the Bristol West seat which I believe we can and must win when the election comes. Bristol has long been a beacon for green creativity and it seems long overdue that this was represented at Westminster. With the city facing devastating cuts to services it is important to fight the destructive politics of austerity and as an economist I am well placed to do this on behalf of the people of Bristol.\nShe continued, “Caroline Lucas has demonstrated what a Green MP can achieve since being elected in 2010: bringing the NHS Reinstatement Bill and a bill to bring the railways back into public ownership before MPs as well as battling against fracking and nuclear power and for renewable energy. But imagine what we could do with more Greens in the House of Commons. The country needs greater Green representation and Bristol West is the place to make this happen.”\nLeader of the Green Group on Bristol City Council Charlie Bolton welcomed the announcements saying, “I know that each of these four candidates will do us proud. On Bristol City Council we have shown what an effective opposition can look like. In the European Parliament Molly has been an incredible ambassador for Bristol and Green politics. I can’t wait to see Bristol properly represented in Westminster. We have waited a long time for this but it is surely now time for a Green MP in Bristol.”",

This could at last put Beeching into reverse but also improve the resilience of routes that have been neglected for years. As Greens we want to see a transport revolution in this country, and serious investment in rail lines around the country is at the heart of our plan.”\nThe Greens are also critical of the way that elected representatives make short-term promises in their constituencies which they then break in whipped votes at Westminster.

The Green Party were the only party to vote against the deal.\nIn her speech, delivered during a full council meeting, Councillor Green highlighted the lack of time councillors were given to understand and deliberate the City Deal, and stressed the large period of time Bristol would be bound to other unitary authorities.\n“We have had very little time to properly consider the implications, which if we proceed will tie us to our LEP partners economically for twenty-five years… It is irresponsible to give the go-ahead to something we don’t fully understand,” she said.\nFor example, the Liberal Democrat councillor for Bishopston David Willingham said that it was “absolutely not acceptable” that councillors were only given two appendices of the paper proposal for the City Deal one day before the full council meeting, and demanded that members of the executive be held to account.\nThe City Deal strikes an agreement between three main parties: the Government, the four West of England unitary authorities, and the West of England Local Enterprise Partnership (LEP).\nWhilst the former two parties are fully elected by the public, the Local Enterprise Partnership is only partially elected, comprising of not only the Mayor of Bristol George Ferguson and the leaders of the other three unitary authorities, but also four members from major businesses within the area, as well as one academic.\nThis mixture of elected and non-elected parties could lead to commercial interests dictating where the money collected in the Economic Development Fund may be invested.\nThere are still no clear guidelines as to how much money each unitary authority will receive from the Economic Development Fund, and which areas of the authorities will receive investment once funds have been allotted.\nFor more information on the City Deal, speak to your local councillor or visit the Bristol City Council website at www.bristol.gov.uk.",

The trio have called for an urgent review of the plans, and are encouraging residents to sign a petition.\nyou.38degrees.org.uk/petitions/public-transport-not-road-building-in-the-west-of-england\nTransport planners have released new proposals for transport in the West of England (known as Joint Local Transport Plan or JLTP4) over the next 10 years [1]. The report acknowledges the need to take urgent action to get the region’s carbon emissions to net zero by 2030, but at the same time proposes to build 10 new roads and widen five more, destroying countryside and suburban fringes around Bristol.\nDr Steve Melia, Senior Lecturer in Transport and Planning at the University of the West of England, has set up a petition calling on the Combined Authority and local Council leaders to urgently review their proposed roadbuilding plans. He said,\n“The plan is a bizarre document, like it was written by two groups of people with totally different views. One group says: all four authorities have declared climate emergencies; we must take urgent action to decarbonise by 2030. The other says: we must build and widen lots of roads to boost economic growth.\n“The trouble is, providing more and better public transport, walking and cycling facilities on its own doesn’t make much difference to carbon emissions – you have to reduce car traffic at the same time. The easiest way to do that is by reducing the road space available to cars, reallocating some of it for walking, cycling and public transport. The Transport Plan mentions this as a possibility, but then destroys its own argument by adding lots of road building.” [2]\nSandy Hore-Ruthven, the Green Party’s candidate for Bristol Mayor, agreed,\n“The West of England is at a pivotal moment where we can choose mass transit, or mass congestion. We can choose to spend millions of pounds on 3 miles of road, or on an excellent public transport system. If the Labour Mayor and Conservative Metro Mayor go ahead with these plans to build so many new roads it will commit us to even more congestion and carbon emissions.\n“I have stood in support of the campaign against the South Bristol Ring Road near Stockwood as an example how these proposals are a waste of money and will not Get Bristol Moving. The money set aside for this new road building programme should be spent on new mass transit, better buses, cycling and walking routes. If the Metro Mayor and Mayor of Bristol are serious about the climate emergency then they should put their money where their mouth is, stop building roads and invest in sustainable transport instead.”\nCarla Denyer, the Bristol Green councillor who proposed the city’s Climate Emergency declaration in 2018 [3], added,\n“It’s intensely frustrating that WECA, who followed Bristol’s lead in declaring a Climate Emergency [4], have produced a plan that is so singularly unhelpful in tackling it. Declaring a Climate Emergency is only the first step, it must be followed by bold and urgent action or it is worthless. So this plan is a very worrying sign that some of the Council leaders who make up WECA, all of whom signed up to the Climate Emergency declaration, may not have fully grasped its meaning. Or worse, were they jumping on the bandwagon to get a little bit of positive press coverage with no intention of following through?\n“The plans are due to be formally adopted on 20th March, so we have a small window of opportunity to persuade the decision-makers to change their minds. I hope that everyone who shares my concern will sign Steve’s petition [5] and write to the Metro Mayor and the leaders of their local Council, before it’s too late.”\nThe Joint Local Transport Plan was published in January, and is due to be discussed at North Somerset Council on 18th February and Bristol’s Cabinet on 3rd March, before the West of England Joint Committee decide whether to adopt the plan on 20th March. (South Gloucestershire Council discussed it on 12th February and Bath & North East Somerset Council will make a single member decision.)\nThe West of England Overview and Scrutiny committee, chaired by Bristol councillor Stephen Clarke, has already called for a review of the plan. On 31st January it submitted a report to the Combined Authority saying,\n“We believe that WECA should revisit the prioritisation of the major schemes list that was decided before the declaration of the Climate Emergency and re-assess them in the light of the emergency.”\nNotes:",

It is outrageous to think that car manufacturers lied about the pollution their products produced. It is because of this that I welcome these parliamentary recommendations. The people I represent are horrified that car manufacturers have been cheating on emissions tests and they demand strong action from the European Parliament to stand up to this corporate abuse of power.\nHowever, I’m disappointed that the Green proposal for an independent agency to regulate and monitor emissions was not passed. Such a body is essential to safeguard the health of people in cities like Bristol in the South West of England. This is an example of where, to constrain corporate power and protect public health, we really do need more Europe rather than less.\nDuring the committee’s work, we have seen the power of the car industry lobby and conservative forces in the Parliament including the UK Tories working with them to water down the protections that citizens need. This vote will help break the cosy relationship between national authorities, car manufacturers, and the technical bodies in charge of the testing to make sure citizens know the truth of just how polluting our cars are. While this report represents a step in the right direction we need to put citizens and their health first and demand that car manufacturers do not cheat on the tests and cheat people out of their health and their futures.”\nNotes\nAir pollution is responsible for 40,000 deaths a year in the UK and 300 each year in the city of Bristol.",

Councillor Daniella Radice was dismayed to learn that confirmation of the four tracks between Filton Abbey Wood and Temple Meads Station is postponed until October.\nRob Telford, Green councillor for Ashley ward said:\n“Rail takes pressure off Bristol’s roads, cutting congestion and pollution. Rail jobs are green jobs, and slowly renationalising franchises as they come up for tender is the right approach to build a better transport system for Bristol and the UK.”\nThe rail franchise system has cost tax payers millions of pounds. Since privatisation, our rail network has mainly been operated by multinational bus companies – First and Stagecoach – who have to make a profit for their shareholders. In Europe, most rail and bus services are public services. The East Coast Mainline, which has been run by Directly Operated Rail for the past 3 years is successful.

At its AGM the 585 member strong advisory body has called for the Board of Trustees to take immediate action to ensure the university is ‘fossil free’ by 2021.\nSpeaking after the meeting, Green Councillor Carla Denyer who tabled the motion said:\n“I am delighted by today’s decision which has followed a long campaign from students, staff, alumni and politicians. We have heard loud and clearly today that the university’s own advisory body recognises that investing in fossil fuel extraction, the major driver of climate change, is simply unacceptable.”\n“A quarter of universities across the UK have now committed to divest. When we started this campaign we were asking the University to show leadership – now we are just asking them to keep up.”\nBristol’s Green MEP, Molly Scott Cato, who co-signed the motion and spoke at today’s meeting said:\n“Today a clear message has been sent to the university’s trustees. We must divest from fossil fuels to protect the long term security of both our finances and our planet. Scientific evidence shows that 75% of fossil fuels needs to stay in the ground if we are to have any chance of staying with the two degree warming limit. But divesting from fossils fuels is no longer just the right thing to do for future generations, it is the right thing to do for hard-nosed economic reasons. Because fossil fuels cannot be burned the value of oil and gas companies have fallen rapidly in value. The Bank of England has set up a special expert body to explore the extent of these risks. Meanwhile the European Parliament recently passed a Green amendment so that these stranded assets must now be reported by pension funds.”\n“Today Bristol University Court showed the university’s pioneering spirit to pass a motion that was both forward thinking and ultimately evidence based. I am proud to have been able to support the motion and Carla Denyer, a fantastic local councillor who has worked so hard to guide this motion through”.\nPaloma Parkes, one of the students from the Fossil Free University of Bristol campaign, said:\n“After the appointment by Donald Trump of a climate change denier to be in charge or the Environmental Protection Agency, the need for action on climate change is more urgent than ever.

Deputy Mayor Cheney agreed to offering a ‘real choice’ in future consultations and made positive noises about councillor involvement.\nGiving a statement at the same cabinet session, Green Councillor Clive Stevens accused the Labour administration of wasting public money with the consultation and subsequent u-turn on council tax support, pointing out that facts supporting their decision to maintain the policy without cuts had been available long before the consultation started, saying that the “information was available last summer and this whole expense could have been spared.”\nSpeaking after the meeting, Councillor Denyer said “I had hoped that this administration might commit to protect this vital support for the poorest in the City beyond just next year, and it is well within the Mayor’s powers to do so. While we’re glad they have announced a temporary U-turn, and that the deputy Mayor has now agreed to offer a proper consultation in future, so far it seems the Labour administration may not have learnt the lesson from the strong public response to cutting council tax support.

Opponents of the amendment claimed the Greens’ plan for congestion charging could be illegal, however legal advice from Council officers in February 2019 did not support this and Cardiff Council is moving forward with a similar plan. The amendment was fully costed and approved by Council Finance officers.\nGreens said they were pleased that the revenue element of their amendment had been supported but that by voting down the ‘capital’ measures in the amendment Labour and Tory councillors had chosen ‘business as usual’ over engaging with the city’s problems.\nLeader of the Green Group, Councillor Eleanor Combley said:\n“After a motion from Greens in 2018, Bristol was the first city in Europe to declare a climate emergency. But since then we’ve seen little action from the Labour administration other than organising committees and reports. And despite claiming to recognise the emergency the Mayor has supported airport expansion and opposed moves to divest council pensions from fossil fuels. We’ve also seen inaction on major local issues – air pollution and traffic congestion have got worse and worse for Bristolians, and over its four year term this administration has completely failed to deal with them.\n“Our amendment was based on acting on the climate emergency and tackling the interlinked crises of air pollution and transport. We found millions of pounds of investment for local transport improvements and to lower household carbon emissions and energy bills – tackling climate change and putting money back in people’s pockets. With a congestion charge to reduce traffic and fund cheaper and better buses we proposed a concrete solution to the city’s gridlocked roads.\n“In voting with Tories to reject the bulk of our amendment, Labour have once again chosen business as usual over the major reforms Bristol needs. As they have for the last four years in this chamber they chose to attack Greens and pat themselves on the back rather than engaging with what the city actually needs. In May it will be down to voters to make this choice – between 4 more years of talking or a bold programme to tackle our city’s priorities.”",

Green Councillors first challenged the proposed cuts back in August, and suggested the consultation itself could be illegal.\nIn September the City Council’s legal officers informed Councillor Eleanor Combley, Leader of the Green councillors, that they had received advice from a QC showing that the consultation is legal. However, despite being elected Members of the Council, the Green councillors were not allowed to view this legal advice – even when they promised confidentiality.\nCouncillor Carla Denyer first identified the similarities between Bristol’s Council Tax consultation and the Haringey consultation which was ruled illegal by the Supreme Court. She commented on this latest obstruction:\n“The Labour-run Council is preventing opposition councillors from doing our job of scrutinising their decisions. This is what multi-party democracy and opposition councillors are for. We have raised legitimate concerns about the legality and morality of the proposals and we have effectively been told ‘never you mind, we’ll take care of this’. It’s not good enough.”\nCouncillor Denyer also suggested the refusal to disclose evidence to councillors was in contrast to the Mayor’s frequently espoused commitment to transparent government and an open door policy. Councillor Denyer said:\n“Marvin’s words on transparency are laudable but he sometimes needs to follow through in his actions – holding a consultation that offers people no real choice, and then hiding the legal justification for said consultation from opposition councillors, hardly screams ‘open government’”\nThe Greens have opposed the Labour administration’s proposed cuts to council tax support as they would likely to lead to significant costs for the poorest residents in the city, who face council bailiffs and possible homelessness if they are unable to pay. Councillor Eleanor Combley said:\n“We know that cuts to council tax support will result in debt, bailiff visits, and increased food and fuel poverty for people in the City who are already struggling just to get by. We know that they are likely to result in increased costs to the Council through extra strain on other services, and that they will see more Bristolians pushed into homelessness and going to food banks to survive. Opposing these cuts is simply about protecting the City’s poorest residents, something one might think the Labour administration would be able to agree with us on.”\nCouncillor Combley added that due to the extra costs involved in collection and pressure on other services, cuts to council tax support would likely cause a great deal of pain in return for relatively small savings. Evidence collected by the Joseph Rowntree foundation has suggested that cuts to council tax support may be a ‘false economy’, and Camden council recently reinstated 100% support.",

  "https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_/https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_news_green-councillors-raise-alarm-over-broadmead-expansion-plans/content_484.html": "menu\nBristol Green councillors today raised concerns about the impact on congestion and air quality of proposed plans to redevelop the Broadmead shopping area in the City Centre. The councillors added their concerns to those raised by groups such as Bristol Cycling and Historic England about the impact of the expansion, particularly as regards the expected car park (with space for 580 cars) which would be built with the entrance on Bond Street, adjacent to the current Fabricland store. The plans are due to be discussed at a City Hall planning meeting on September 6th.\nAbove: illustration of the sizes of proposed buildings, from the developers plans. The proposed car park would be the large 40m high building on the left of the image.\nJerome Thomas, Green councillor for Clifton, stressed that while he wasn’t opposed to plans to redevelop Broadmead itself, and supported the concept of ‘pedestrianising’ more of the city centre, the proposed additional car park and its access were flawed for a variety of reasons.\nCouncillor Thomas said: “At almost 600 spaces the proposed car parking will bring a large number of additional cars into our already over-congested city centre, in an area of the city where air pollution levels already exceed the legal limit. Required additional traffic lights, and plans to route incoming traffic into the car park through York Street via Gloucester Street and Brunswick Square look set to create traffic chaos. To further complicate matters this will coincide with the re-routing of buses that currently pass Cabot Circus via The Horsefair. The air quality levels in this part of the city centre are already far above the legal limits and the additional car traffic and congestion would only add to this problem. The council therefore risks failing in its plans (and its legal duty) to reduce air pollution levels before it has even begun to properly address them. In addition there is little evidence in the planning documents I have seen that the impact of these changes on pedestrian and cyclist access has been properly considered.”\nCouncillor Eleanor Combley, leader of the Green Group also highlighted that proposals were cycling unfriendly. “We all know that cars take up far more space on the roads than an equal number of people travelling by foot, bus or bike. These plans would prioritise cars and discourage cyclists and walkers with unsafe and busy access through traffic. I welcome investment in making the city centre a more appealing destination, and in particular the plans in this proposal to create a larger and more attractive pedestrianised area, but additional car journeys make that aim harder to achieve. Bristol already has problems with air quality and congestion – new development should seek to make that better, not worse.”\n“If you oppose these changes then make your voice heard. My colleague Councillor Bolton has started a petition on 38 degrees called ‘Let Broadmead Breathe’ which calls on the planners and Bristol Council to reject development plans due to the car park. You can also submit a statement to the planning committee by noon on Tuesday September 5th.”\n____\nNB: Public Forum items should be emailed to democratic.services@bristol.gov.uk.

Their report won’t be due until May, so on what evidence is he making this decision?\nThe expansion of the airport will increase carbon emissions by 59% (the airport could only be ‘carbon neutral’ if plane and car journeys were excluded) yet we urgently need to reduce CO2 emissions as fast as possible if we’re going to have a chance of meeting the target voted on by all councillors and help prevent runaway global warming and catastrophic levels of climate change.\nThe Mayor needs to realise that Bristol has two budgets to manage – a financial one and a carbon budget. Allowing the increase in flights will be a huge carbon overspend. Supporting this expansion totally undermines his commitment to getting to carbon neutral by 2030.\nThe Mayor has a responsibility to the city and its residents to consider the long term good of the city and should be able to see beyond short term ‘growth’ and slogans for his next election.\nPerhaps Marvin Rees doesn’t really care about 2030 but about 2020?”\nGreen Councillor for Clifton\nPaula O’Rourke",

South West Greens are raising the alarm about the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) which is seeking to remove regulatory differences between the US and EU countries.\nThe Green Party is concerned that once in place the agreement will take precedence over national and European legislation and give corporations the power to take legal action against regulations that protect employment, the environment, or consumer standards.\nGreen Party finance speaker, Professor Molly Scott Cato, who is also the Green Party’s lead European candidate in the South West said:\n“Because the trade deal is being negotiated in secret it is difficult to know exactly what it entails, but suspicions have been aroused that it will seek to undermine EU controls on such environmental threats as GM and neonicotinoid pesticides. The fact that the negotiations are not open and accountable suggests that whatever is being stitched up might attract significant popular opposition if it were made public. I think we can assume that the negotiators are working in the interest of corporations rather than citizens.”\nHenry Gent, a Devon dairy farmer and also a candidate on the Greens’ European list, added:\n“In the South West we focus on high-quality produce and high animal welfare standards. In the new trade regime it is likely that corporations that focus on volume rather than quality will be able to undermine the high welfare standards that we have in the UK. In the dairy industry this may mean that we will be forced to accept milk produced from cows that have been given the BST hormone, even though consumers do not want such milk and we have worked strenuously in the EU to oppose the use of BST.”\nGreen Party MP, Caroline Lucas, has published an Early Day Motion calling on the Government to push for talks on TTIP to be frozen immediately, in order to allow for a full public debate and Parliamentary scrutiny. Only a handful of MPs have signed it. Dr Scott Cato said:\n“The lack of support for Caroline Lucas’ Early Day Motion from all sides of the House demonstrates the important work Greens in Parliament and in Europe are doing in challenging corporate power and exposing shady deals being done behind closed doors.”\nNotes\nEuropean Commission perspective and background information on TTIP: http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/in-focus/ttip/\nGeorge Monbiot article: http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/04/us-trade-deal-full-frontal-assault-on-democracy\nEuropean Bans on Neonicotinoid Pesticides\nhttp://www.epa.gov/pesticides/about/intheworks/ccd-european-ban.html\nCaroline Lucas Early Day motion: Transatlantic Trade And Investment Partnership: http://www.edms.org.uk/2013-14/793.htm",

The amendment proposes that this income is put towards the Supporting People budget which funds preventative services that support vulnerable people to live independently.\nCouncillor Combley said:\n“First and foremost this is about fairness and about us following our own rules. The council’s constitution is very clear that the allowance we are given is also to cover travel costs within the city. Any councillor getting the bus or the train pays for their own ticket, so why are we using taxpayers money to subsidise councillors who choose to drive by paying for their parking?”\nShe continued:\n“I suggest spending the income on Supporting People services instead because these services are highly valued by the people who use them, including people with mental health issues, learning difficulties or sensory impairment and people living with HIV. Cutting this support may also prove to be a false economy as without help to remain independent, people may well end up back on our books needing a higher level of care and support in crisis.”\nLocal residents have expressed surprise that councillors still have subsidised workplace parking instead of showing leadership to promote public and active transport. Bristol resident Johanna Ziegler, said:\n“I work in the city centre and my workplace used to have free car parking, which I always saw as a special luxury rather than as something expected. We don’t have parking provided any more now and everyone still manages to get to work. I think secure cycle storage and good public transport are much more crucial.”\nDespite the council’s dire financial situation, and despite the council passing a Green Party motion on the need to address air pollution in Bristol, Cllr Combley said it is far from certain that the motion will pass. She said:\n“I know I have the full support of the other councillors in the Green group, but I don’t know whether councillors from other parties will vote to support my amendment. I hope they will see that finding an excuse to cling onto this perk when we are cutting desperately needed services in this city should be unacceptable.”\nNotes\nCouncillor Eleanor Combley’s amendment can be found on p596 here: https://democracy.bristol.gov.uk/documents/g263/Public%20reports%20pack%2021st-Feb-2017%2014.00%20Full%20Council.pdf?T=10",

  "https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_/https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_successful-ethical-lettings-charter/content_851.html": "menu\nBristol City Council looks set to become the first Local Authority in the country to introduce an ‘ethical lettings charter’ when the matter is discussed at a Bristol City Council Cabinet meeting tonight. The Mayor is set to make a final decision on the matter, following months of campaigning from community based union ACORN, who are fighting to protect the rights for those who rent across Bristol.\nThe voluntary scheme, which enables participating landlords and agents to achieve a bronze, silver or gold charter mark, is hoping to gain official endorsement from the Council. Councillors have already pledged their support for the scheme, unanimously voting for it at a Full Council meeting in March after a motion was submitted by the Green group of councillors.\n‘The Ethical Lettings Charter is a great opportunity for Bristol to establish itself as a city leading the way in its support for private tenants’ said Community Organiser from ACORN, Nick Ballard. ‘The Charter is the product of hundreds of hours of community consultation and activism by ACORN members and crucially, stands as a grassroots response to Bristol’s housing crisis from those most affected’ he continued.\nHousing campaigner and Green Councillor, Anna McMullen, will be asking the Mayor tonight to ensure that the scheme is not just approved, but also properly publicised and supported. ‘It’s absolutely right that those who rent should be able to check whether future landlords provide a good service and well maintained properties’ she said. ‘To transform the rights of those renting, we also need to make sure the scheme is well rolled out and publicised’ she continued. ‘That is why I am asking the Mayor to write to all letting agencies and landlords to promote the standard as well as just endorsing it.’\n‘The ethical lettings charter is an important first step towards improving housing rights and provision for Bristol residents’ added Daniella Radice, Assistant Mayor for Neighbourhoods. ‘We know that more and more people have to live in the private rented sector with high rents and poor quality accommodation’ she continued. ‘This is why we also fully endorse the suggestion in Bristol’s Housing strategy that the council should establish its own private rented sector company or trust to provide good quality accommodation. This has been successfully demonstrated in Birmingham’.\nACORN’s Community Organiser, Nick Ballard, concluded, ‘The housing crisis is national in scope and any attempt to tackle it must place tenant organisations at the forefront. ACORN is leading the way in providing grassroots and tenant-led action on this issue. An increasing numbers of letting agents and landlords already want to sign up. With interest coming in from around the country, we expect the Mayor to take full advantage of this opportunity to put Bristol on the map and to encourage other Local Authorities to replicate what has been achieved here.’\nFor more information on ACORNs work and the ethical lettings charter see: http://www.acorncommunities.org.uk/",
  "https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_/https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_green-group-leader-lobbies-treasury-for-end-to-local-government-cuts/content_438.html": "menu\nGreen Group leader Eleanor Combley today travelled to London to hand in a letter to the Treasury calling for an end to cuts to local government funding. The letter, signed by Green councillors and councillor candidates around England, highlights the warnings of the Local Government Association (LGA) “of real and growing uncertainty about how local services will be funded beyond 2020” and calls on the Chancellor Philip Hammond MP “to urgently provide local councils with the money they so clearly need to protect services and restore spending on community and frontline services to sustainable levels.” After years of local government cuts, essential frontline services are now threatened in local authorities across the UK – services such as adult social care, looked-after children, domestic abuse survivors, older people and low-income families in crisis.\nCouncillor Combley said:\n“I would like to thank Caroline Lucas for supporting me to take the issue of local government funding all the way to the Treasury, alongside Green Councillors from other areas of the UK. It gave me the opportunity to raise issues affecting Bristol, such as the 30% cut to the budget for youth services voted through by Labour councillors last week. A perfect example of how austerity policies lack both economic and moral sense, this funding cut will end almost all youth work with under 11’s and remove open access sessions. These play an important preventive role, enabling play workers to get to know children well enough to keep them on the right track, and to spot problems before they get serious. Ending this work and limiting funding to targeted work means intervention only comes later, once problems pass a certain threshold, and is highly likely to increase future costs in other service areas.\n“I could not vote for Bristol Labour’s austerity cuts budget, but I will do everything I can to reduce the impact of those cuts, whether by proposing helpful amendments to the budget, working behind the scenes in City Hall or taking the fight to Westminster as I have done today.”\nGreen Party co-Leader Caroline Lucas and Deputy Leader Amelia Womack were also there to support the hand-in. Caroline Lucas said:\n“Our party is united in opposition to these planned cuts. Local authorities are already straining under the intense of pressure of year on year cuts and this further squeeze will put frontline services in the firing line. The Government can stop these cuts – and protect these essential local services – but that would mean ending their ideological love-affair with the failed austerity project. We are urging Philip Hammond to safeguard our vital local services from any further harm.”\nBackground:\n– In December 2017 the Local Government Association – which represents councillors of all parties as well as independents, criticised the government’s continued lack of action on local government funding, stating:\n“Local services are facing a £5.8 billion funding gap in 2019/20, as well as a £1.3 billion pressure to stabilise the adult social care provider market today. The additional council tax flexibility – estimated by our analysis to be worth up to £540 million in 2019/20 if all councils use it in both 2018/19 and 2019/20 – is nowhere near enough to meet the funding gap. The Government needs to provide new funding for all councils over the next few years so they can protect vital local services from further cutbacks.”\n“It is extremely disappointing that the Government has again chosen not to address the continuing funding gap for children’s and adult social care. We have repeatedly warned of the serious consequences of funding pressures facing these services, for both the people that rely on them and the financial sustainability of other services councils provide. An injection of new money from central government is the only way to protect the vital services which care for older and disabled people, protect children and support families.”",
  "https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_/https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_greens-demands-for-the-cop24-negotiations/content_373.html": "The group of Green MEPs have made the following joint statement on the Green demands for COP24.\nThis December government leaders will gather in Katowice, Poland for the COP24 climate summit, where all countries of the world, including EU Member States, must commit to put forward higher 2030 climate targets by 2020. To stay below 1.5°C, as indicated in the landmark IPCC report, the EU needs to commit to significantly increase both its long-term and 2030 targets.\nThree key topics will be debated:\n- The RULEBOOK – Even if it will be technical, agreeing a robust ‘rulebook’ for the Paris Agreement will be crucial as it represents the guidelines for how the global climate pact will be implemented. The compromise that needs to be found should be capable of ensuring that adequate action is taken to cut emissions, adapt to climate change, and address loss and damage. Additional rules to facilitate the smooth transfer of finance, technology and support for capacity building to LDCs and other developing countries will be equally critical to achieving our Paris goals.\n- GLOBAL STOCKTAKE – In Paris, countries have agreed to ramp up their climate pledges over time through the five-year review cycles. The first such review process, called the Talanoa Dialogue, has been running throughout 2018 and aims to take stock of the collective efforts towards achieving the Paris Agreement objectives. The challenge of this COP will be to send clear signals that nations will strengthen their climate commitments by 2020.\n- FINANCE – Cornerstone of the negotiation, it is a key topic to maintain trust by delivering adequate finance to developing countries to address climate change. Industrialized nations agreed to spend a total of $100 billion (€86 billion) per year — including funds and development aid — on climate protection in poorer countries. Developing countries want developed ones to ramp up their spending and report on the extent to which they have met their pledges every two years, so they can predict how much money is coming. It is a big issue of trust which is going on here[1]\nThis COP24 aims to turn the commitments made in that momentous accord into action, let us not miss this opportunity.\nOur Green demands for the EU – TAKE THE LEADERSHIP BACK!\n- The EU must act upon the warnings of the new IPCC report to keep our world to 1.5°C by massively increasing EU 2030 target\nBy 2030, global emissions will need to be halved for us to have a decent chance to stay below 1.5°C. Given the EU needs to reduce emissions much faster than the rest of the world, its 2030 target must be increased even beyond the 55% reduction some Member States and the European Parliament are calling for. The EU also needs to adopt an action plan for this process, which should be finalized by EU Heads of State and Government before UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres’ Global Climate Summit set to take place in September 2019.\n- The EU needs to lead the global effort and thus reduce emissions to net zero by 2050 at the latest.\nThe IPCC report made it clear that staying below 1.5°C requires that global emissions drop to net zero by 2050 at the latest. The EU needs to lead the global effort and thus reduce emissions to net zero by 2050 at the latest. A commitment to much higher 2030 and long-term climate targets ate COP24 would be a clear sign of the much-needed climate leadership the EU needs to regain. Far from fulfilling its duties under the Paris Agreement, which obliges the EU to reduce emissions faster than other countries, the EU‘s recent emission trends do not reflect a true leadership role. Not only the EU’s target is still too weak to meet its Paris Agreement commitments, the EU’s emissions and energy consumption kept on rising three years in a row now.\n- Defend green finance and push for the end of fossil fuels support\nAdequate climate finance is the cornerstone of effective climate policy. It is needed to realize the low-carbon transition in the global north and to put the global south on a low carbon development path. Governments must live up to their promise to mobilize USD 100 billion annually by 2020 and EU should lead the ambition.\nToday, investments in renewable energy are declining. Many EU Member States are failing to fulfil their climate and energy targets and bring about real change at home. To restore its role as a global climate leader, the EU needs both to significantly increase its climate targets for the future and accelerate current emission cuts. Stronger measures need to be taken to phase out coal, end public subsidies to fossil fuels and accelerate support to renewable energy development and efforts to reduce energy waste. To keep temperature rise to 1.5°C we need bold action and higher targets, not either or but at once.\n- Be the voice of the pro climate-society that flourishes all over our territories and calls for a just transition that makes bigger polluters pay first and leaves no one behind\nIt is time for real leadership and urgent action, building on the clear momentum we are already seeing in our communities, societies and economies. We should make sure that the big companies are actually paying for the damage they are causing to our climate and environment. A just transition is also one that leaves no one behind, gives security and perspectives to the citizens, workers and communities affected by the transition, and makes sure all parts of society reap the benefits of the transition, not only the happy few.\n[1] So far, more than $10 billion was pledged to the Green Climate Fund, of which $3.5 billion has been paid so far.",
  "https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_/https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_save-20mph/content_406.html": "menu\nThe Green Party believes it is vital that we retain the 20mph limits in the city which have brought such benefits for huge areas of the city as a whole. 20mph is good for our safety, our environment and our health.\nWe would be appalled if there was any attempt to remove them, and would like to see strong evidence of the need for removal in any of the streets mentioned in the review.\nThe benefits of 20mph have often been cited, but are as follows:\n1. Safety\nA peer reviewed paper produced by UWE (1) demonstrates that ‘The estimated total number of injuries avoided across the city each year is 4.53 fatal, 11.3 serious, and 159.3 slight injuries.’\nThe graph (7) illustrates this:\n2. Saves money\nThe same report also estimates that ‘The estimated annual saving following the decrease in casualties is £15,256,309’\n3. Cuts speeds\nIt also tells us ‘there was a statistically significant 2.7mph decrease in vehicle speeds’. Average speed decreased on 100 roads out of 106.’\n4. Doesn’t increase and may cut emissions\nIntuitively, it must be obvious to all of us who live in a city that the idea of the ‘open road’ is a myth. Cities are beset with junctions, roundabouts, mini-roundabouts, various crossings, traffic, but above all – an awful lot of other traffic. All of these slow motorists down. Indeed, driving advice is that it is better (more fuel efficient) to drive at a constant slower rate than doing a lot of accelerating and decelerating (2).\n5. It’s good for cyclists and pedestrians\nOne of the most common reasons people give for not cycling is fear of traffic. Clearly part of this is the fear of being hit by vehicles. By slowing down the traffic, you encourage more people to cycle. Likewise, a stream of speeding vehicles can clearly make it harder for pedestrians to cross the road, especially elderly pedestrians.\n6. It’s good for motorists\nLiving Streets (3) suggest ‘drivers cut their spacing as braking distances contract, shorter gaps mean more vehicles use the available road space, reducing standing traffic, and filtering at junctions becomes easier. Also – given lower speeds encourage active travel, the roads become clearer!\n7. It’s good for health\nBecause it encourages active travel (ie cycling and walking), the population as a whole becomes healthier.\n8. Good for the planet\nAnd this should give the planet a better chance in our fight against runaway climate change.\n9. Labour Wales is thinking of doing it….Labour London too!\nA recent report (4) shows the Labour devolved assembly in Wales is considering introducing a blanket zone in built up areas. The world is moving to more people-friendly, family-friendly towns and cities. Another report shows the London mayor is also thinking of doing it (8).\n10. Safer for cyclists\nBristol City Councils own research (5) shows ‘There was a clear reduction in injury odds in 20mph compared to 30mph’ for cyclists\n11. Dangers of higher speeds for pedestrians\nBristol City Councils own research (6) also shows ‘For example, the risk of being killed is almost 5 times higher in collisions between a car and a pedestrian at 50km/h (31mph) compared to the same type of collisions at 30 km/h (18.6mph) reports OECD.’\nWe could go on.\nIn conclusion, we repeat – it is vital that this city maintains its commitment to 20mph, and needs to be looking at ways to improve its effectiveness. We need to move on from a debate about the benefits of lower speeds, and accept them for the success that they are.\nReferences:\nhttp://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/transport-travel/driving-advice\nhttps://www.livingstreets.org.uk/media/3468/review-of-current-practice.pdf",

For example, the percentage of municipal waste sent to landfill (instead of being sent for reuse, recycling or composting) is still above the target, but has improved in the last 12 months.3\nHowever, Green councillors are concerned about precisely how arms-length the company will be! Several interface staff roles in the Council will be made obsolete as part of the new contract. The roles are currently held by staff with significant expertise in waste management.\nCouncillor Carla Denyer, who has been sitting on the Neighbourhood Scrutiny committee for the last year, explains:\n“We need to ensure the Council retains enough in-house expertise to challenge BWC and hold them to account throughout the 10 year contract. We support the principle of a council-owned waste company, but are concerned that the change in interface with BWC will make it harder for councillors and the public to get issues fixed.”\nNotes:\nCabinet report: Proposals for Future Waste Collection, Street Cleansing and Winter Maintenance Service here>>\nA summary of the advantages of Teckal companies here>>\nNeighbourhoods Scrutiny Commission – Q4 Outturn Performance Report – 2015/16 here>> (page 8)\nStatement submitted by Cllr Carla Denyer to Cabinet meeting: statement text here>>, video here>>\nQuestions submitted by Cllr Clive Stevens to Neighbourhoods Scrutiny Commission: text here>>, video here>>\nQuestion submitted by Cllr Martin Fodor to Cabinet meeting here>>",

One report is by the Soil Association, the well-known food and farming charity; the other by Simon Fairlie of the Land Workers’ Alliance.\nBoth reports foresee a future where policies put soil health and biodiversity first, and where the way we use land helps tackle climate change.

This has caused bookings to be cancelled, events to be pulled and shopper numbers to drop off a cliff. In order to keep our city safe, and our NHS functioning it is crucial that this happens.\nHowever, this means that already struggling businesses are facing extreme losses, especially ones who have stock in for this normally very busy week run up to Christmas. As you know, these businesses have been supporting their local communities for the last two years, becoming pop up grocery stores in the first lockdown and in many cases providing food to children in school holidays. Businesses have scraped their way through the last few years, and have just begun the slow painful rebuilding process. They now face inflation at its highest rate in a decade, with a new wave of COVID surging, increased financial hardship, closures, joblessness and even homelessness.\nWe are writing to ask you as WECA mayor to call on the Treasury to urgently produce financial support measures for businesses now being hit, especially the self-employed, small businesses, hospitality, retail and creative businesses. We urgently require the reintroduction of COVID grants, furlough, and sick pay so that staff can afford to isolate and recover. We would also appreciate your support also for Universal Basic Income to ensure that no one falls through the safety net this time.\nWe urge you to call for the financial support needed to get through this crucial time.\nCllr Ani Stafford-Townsend and Cllr Barry Parsons, shadow cabinet members for Culture, Communities, Equalities & Public Health on behalf of Bristol Green Group.\nCllr Barry Parsons is the Chair of the Homes and Housing Delivery Committee\nMore about Barry",

At the national level, an all-party Parliamentary Commission is a key first step in achieving justice and starting the conversations we need to have as a society about our past and present – I think it’s right that reparations is part of that conversation.”\nDiscussing reparations, Cleo added:\n“This isn’t just about monetary compensation, it goes much wider than that and is a movement that has existed for centuries, ever since the first transgressions of our humanity as African heritage people. The first step is an acknowledgement by the British state that what happened was wrong and a formal apology should follow – this is an essential step to repair, as so far our experiences of historic and ongoing wrongs have been denied. We also need to see an active commitment from the government to prevent further injustice.”\nCleo also urged members of the public who support the motion to submit statements to the council meeting. She said:\n“This motion is significant, timely and historic. It represents good democracy in that it combines grass roots activism and movements such as ‘Stop The Maangamizi Campaign’ with the political system. The time has come to right the wrongs that plague society and keep it from being equal and equitable. It has been an intergenerational struggle that landed on the doorstep of Bristol, a city built off the backs of our African ancestors.

I am delighted that today Bristol has elected 11 councillors who I know will represent the people of this city and represent the values we share. Across the city we have seen growing support for progressive politics, and Greens look forward to continuing our collaborative and constructive approach with other parties.”\nIn addition, the Green Party picked up double the number of votes for their Mayoral candidate compared to the last mayoral election, finishing above the Lib Dems and UKIP. Tony Dyer was praised by the new Mayor of Bristol, Marvin Rees, in his acceptance speech for his insight and integrity throughout the election campaign.\nCommenting on the Green success, Tony Dyer said:\n“Across the city thousands upon thousands of people voted for a Green vision, not just for their community, but for the whole city. I am truly honoured to have received such fantastic support. Looking ahead, there is a great opportunity now for the local Greens to continue to influence the direction of the city, ensuring that our priorities of truly affordable housing, an accessible transport system and building a Green and healthier city are put into practice.”\nIn total, Greens earned over 50,000 votes for Green council candidates across the city, which on top of the 11 seats won, resulted in Greens narrowly missing several other seats by as few as 7 votes.\nCoordinator of Bristol Green Party, Sean Buchan said:\n“I want to thank the tireless team of candidates and volunteers who worked so hard to bring about this result. Greens are not funded by big business or unions, so every win is a result of hours upon hours of work from our dedicated supporters to build a better Bristol.”\nWe consolidated our hold on Clifton and Clifton Down with Paula O’Rourke ousting the sitting Conservative councillor in Clifton and joining Jerome Thomas on the council, as well as Clive Stevens ousting the sitting Liberal Democrat in Clifton Down to join sitting Green councillor Carla Denyer.\nBut we are very sad to lose some excellent Green councillors who have worked extremely hard on our behalf to promote Green values and ideas on the city council. Daniella Radice, Rob Telford, Gus Hoyt, Ani Stafford-Townsend and Anna McMullen will all be sorely missed by all of us in Bristol Green Party, and by all Bristolians who have voted for a Greener Bristol. We are extremely grateful to them all, not forgetting Tim Malnick, Dani Glazzard and Deb Joffe who had decided not to seek re-election. We send them all our heartfelt thanks and wish them all well in the future.",

The Bristol area has also seen an increase. The UK as a whole also saw reported hate crime at its highest level ever recorded between July and September last year.\nDr Scott Cato said:\n“I am shocked by the instability and divisions that the vote to leave the EU have created. The Leave Campaign’s deplorable use of fearmongering around immigration and asylum seekers has undoubtedly fuelled this hatred. The election of a racist bigot to the White House will only further embolden those who want to sow division and hatred.\nHowever, Molly Scott Cato went on to praise communities across the region for the strong stand they are taking against hatred and extremism. She said:\n“I have been hugely heartened to see people rally in their thousands against racism and hatred. In particular, we have seen huge demonstrations across the region in recent weeks against Donald Trump’s Muslim ban, and almost two million people have signed a petition calling on the government to bar Trump from making an official state visit to the UK.

We’d like to see the Bristol Waste Company play a full part in innovations and experiments that foster and encourage these activities working in partnership with other Bristol organisations and groups.

The vote followed a Green Party motion put to the November full council meeting.\nThe vote follows work by Greens for much of 2015 to see action gets taken to clean up Bristol’s illegal air limits including tabling a clean air motion at Full Council, supporting local residents to get over 4,000 signatures calling for a clean air zone and collecting surveys on air pollution across the city.”\nActually it started before 2015\nGreen legend GlennVowles was campagning for clean air in 1989.\nBudget amendment\nThis started in February of this year when a motion to a budget amendment proposed by Jerome Thomas was defeated by other parties. The amendment – if passed – would have funded to work out the detail of how a Clean Air Zone might work.\n5 point plan\nGreens worked up a 5 point plan – based on the Policy Exchange 10 point plan. This calls for more walking and cycling, cleaner buses, supporting cleaner taxis, restrictions on the most polluting cars from entering Bristol, and promoting electric vehicles and car clubs.\nSurvey\nIn the autumn of this year, the Greens launched a survey of Bristol residents to find out their views on air pollution. It consisted of both an on-line survey and paper based surveying carried out at a variety of locations around the city (mainly in inner Bristol). It established that over half of those surveyed believe their health is affected by the different pollutants. It also established overwhelming support for each of the parts of the 5 point plan.\nPetition\nSubsequently, Greens heavily supported and promoted a petition for Clean Air (which basically said more or less everything we asked for – handy that!). The 38 degrees petition got just under 4,200 signatures in a fortnight.\nStatues\nObviously, the Green Party couldn’t endorse the hanging of gas marks on statues along with ‘Let Bristol Breathe’ banners. But it seems someone did just that.\nMotion\nThe motion to full council asked Bristol to lobby for its inclusion in a Clean Air Zone; it commits it to having a Clean Air Zone, once legislation is in place; it includes the 5 point plan; it requires a robust air quality strategy; and it requires longer term targets.\nWhat next?\nWe will be discussing this . But – well, getting a motion unanimously through a council meeting is great, but the air is no cleaner today. So a key part of what we need to do is to see this thing through.\nBeyond that, there are a whole set of things that need to be addressed – ranging from setting up a local Clean Air alliance to addressing other causes of air pollutants.\nBut the work doesn’t stop there – lives are being shortened every day so there is no time for delay. We need to see our Mayor and MPs take immediate action in Bristol to remove the barriers to clean air, including cleaning up the bus fleet, supporting taxis to meet clean emission standards and restricting heavily polluting vehicles from the most polluted streets in our city.\nWhat do you think?

She said:\n“It is great news for the Village that the Princess Victoria Street scheme will be made permanent. We can see that the data collected by the Council supports making it permanent – it shows clearly that levels of walking and cycling have increased and that on average more people are visiting Princess Victoria Street than before. The increased footfall is particularly good news given the uncertain economic times we are living through.\nShe added:\n“Despite concerns expressed by traders and others, we are really pleased that the shops which people treasure in Clifton Village remain, despite the many pressures on the high street. Like any scheme, there are some issues people have raised that will need to be addressed going forwards – these will be easier to tackle once the scheme has been made permanent.”\nThe pedestrianisation of the high street will continue along the same lines it has operated during the trial – the end of the high street will be closed to vehicles between 11am-5pm every day, with exemptions for bikes and emergency vehicles.\nDon Alexander, the Council’s Cabinet member for Transport, said:\n“I’ve really enjoyed my visits to Princess Victoria Street to see the progress of this project. There’s something wonderful about seeing a venerable old street find new vibrancy and purpose. As we continue towards completion, I hope that residents, traders and visitors will all benefit from improved health and happiness because of the hard work of so many.”\nThe Council recorded footfall, cyclist and vehicle traffic in Princess Victoria street in before and throughout the period of the trial in order to assess the impact on traffic and visitors in the area. A report on the findings noted an increase in the average numbers of visitors to the street, particularly on weekends, with the average pedestrians per hour during weekdays being largely the same as before the trial. There was also an increase in people visiting and travelling through the area by bike.\nThe Council’s report summarising the results said “Our data shows that more people are visiting Princess Victoria Street on average, and that neighbouring roads are coping with the modest increase in traffic. Our data also shows that motor traffic levels are down overall in the Clifton Village area.”\nLocal resident Sue Ottey also welcomed the news, saying:\n“I am so glad that the Princess Victoria Street pedestrianisation scheme is to be made permanent. It’s a positive pleasure to visit the shops and cafes without having to look out for cars and vans.”\nClifton Green Councillor Paula O’Rourke said:\n“We know that many residents appreciate the pedestrianisation, and feel safer on the road. It is so much more pleasant to visit now cars are not there. Given the push for greater pedestrianisation throughout the city and the vision countrywide for cities with more liveable neighbourhoods, the Princess Victoria Street closure has put Clifton Village ahead of the curve.”\nAnth Bruges is a Clifton resident who visited the street recently with her daughter Bea Barrett. Anth said:\n“It’s so good being able to have a coffee outside – we often stop off for one when we’re shopping ”\nBea added:\n“It looks so much better than it used to – no cars and all the plants and seating – it’s really lovely”",

The accusation comes following a vote in the European Parliament in favour of the CETA trade deal between Canada and the EU. The vote saw Socialists divided on the controversial trade treaty with 97 voting in favour and 67 against.\nLabour MEPs who are members of the Socialist and Democrats group, were equally split, with seven voting against the deal; 10 in favour and two abstaining. Divisions amongst Labour MPs were also exposed last week when CETA was voted on in the House of Commons. Despite shadow international trade secretary, Barry Gardiner, urging Labour MPs to vote against the deal, they instead voted in favour by 85 to 68.\nMolly a longtime opponent of the CETA trade deal, said:\n“With trade, as with Brexit, Labour are exposing how weak they are as an opposition. The Party is hopelessly split between backing the citizens of Europe and caving into corporate power.\n“Their long-time trade coordinator in the European Parliament, David Martin, has been a forceful supporter of CETA and has strenuously opposed the Greens for their opposition to the anti-democratic aspects of this treaty. No wonder their shadow trade minister can only persuade half his MPs to vote against this dodgy deal.\n“The weakness of socialists in Europe to protect citizens against the worst aspects of corporate globalisation plays straight into the hands of the extreme right and nationalist forces which are on the rise across the continent”.\nCETA has long been opposed by European Greens as well as by trade justice campaigners, trade unions, and millions of citizens in the EU and Canada. Opposition has focused on the fact the treaty will allow corporations to sue governments over legislation that threatens their profits and concerns over how the deal will impact on workers’ rights, climate action, animal welfare, and chemical and product safety. Molly concluded:\n“As Greens we don’t believe that more deregulation and more power for corporations is the way to support citizens in Europe. We believe that putting citizens first involves strong environmental, health, social, agricultural and animal welfare standards, and fighting against tax havens and climate change. This means killing off toxic trade deals like CETA. Greens will continue this fight in countries across Europe.”",

One report is by the Soil Association, the well-known food and farming charity; the other by Simon Fairlie of the Land Workers’ Alliance.\nBoth reports foresee a future where policies put soil health and biodiversity first, and where the way we use land helps tackle climate change. They agree that to achieve this, farmers will need to receive at least as much money as they currently get through the Common Agriculture Policy (CAP). However, they say direct payments based on land area should be scrapped and retargeted at paying farmers for the public benefits they provide. They also call for additional funding for advice, training, and farmer-led research and innovation.\nOther more radical ideas from Simon Fairlie include a shift away from export markets so UK farmers can focus on meeting UK demands for food; 20% VAT on processed meat products, and ‘polluter pays’ labelling on food products which involve the use of artificial fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides and GM materials. Meanwhile the Soil Association calls for a new national agroforestry strategy, a ban on the routine preventative use of antibiotics, and using procurement to drive demand for locally produced, especially organic, food.\nMolly said:\n“We have a government that is not only clueless on how to improve the lot of our farmers and food producers, but is also chasing damaging trade deals with the US and Canada which would weaken the higher EU standards that have shaped UK agriculture over the last 40 years.\n“The absence of any plan for our food and farming sectors is even more alarming given the extreme form of Brexit that Theresa May’s government is pushing for. Around 65% of total UK agricultural exports go to the EU, while around 70% of the UK’s imports originate from other EU countries. Removing us from the single market risks punitive tariffs on exports and imports, while an end to free movement would make it impossible to take on the seasonal migrant labour from EU countries so crucial to many farms.\n“Yet Brexit could be a unique opportunity to move towards an ecologically sustainable farming system; one that focuses on supporting family farms and relocalising food production, thereby creating thriving rural communities. We can also refocus land management to encourage biodiversity, improve animal welfare and help tackle climate change.\n“These two reports do something that the government seem incapable of doing – providing a wealth of exciting and innovative ideas for policy makers, farmers, food producers and rural communities. But ultimately what happens to farming will affect us all as it will shape the future of our economic, social, environmental and physical landscapes”.\nDr Tom MacMillan, Director of Innovation at the Soil Association, said:\n“We’re hearing a fair bit of consensus from farming, nature and public interest groups on the big principles for agricultural policy after we leave the CAP – that the public expect high standards on animal welfare, for example, and that public money should pay for public benefits. What’s missing are practical and inspiring ideas that seize the chance to make a better fist of it, and face up to monumental challenges like climate change. So we’ve tried to set out a few game-changing ideas in our report”.\nFurther information about the two reports.\n[1] Response to Parliamentary Question 63096 asked by Caroline Lucas MP:\nThe Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has provided the following answer to your written parliamentary question (63096):\nQuestion:\nTo ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, what research the Government has commissioned in the last six months to inform the development of agricultural and environmental policy once the UK leaves the EU. (63096)\nTabled on: 06 February 2017\nAnswer from George Eustice:\nDefra invests a significant amount in agricultural and environmental research to underpin policy development and implementation. Much of this is relevant to the development of future policy in the context of EU exit.\nHowever, research specifically to inform agricultural and environmental policy once the UK leaves the EU, which is distinct from the department’s on-going research programmes, has not been commissioned in the last 6 months.\nThe answer was submitted on 09 Feb 2017 at 17:54.",

Greens say Bristol City Council must take the lead in calling for the fund to develop a strategy to reduce investment in fossil fuels to zero over a five year period.\nGreen Councillor for Redland, Martin Fodor who tabled the motion said:\n“Across the city the pressure is mounting for divestment, as communities stand up and say they don’t want their money invested in fossil fuel industries. We are proud of the Council’s commitment earlier this year not to invest in any fossil fuel industries2, and it’s now time for our pension funds to follow suit.”\n“There is a growing realisation that divesting from fossil fuels is not just good for the environment, it is a sound financial judgement too. Investment in the fossil fuel industry is increasingly risky given that the sector is likely to fall in value – sooner rather than later. This is a view shared by Mark Carney, Government of the Bank of England3 and Sir Nicholas Stern, former Chief economist of the World Bank. 75% of fossil fuels need to stay in the ground to avoid dangerous climate change4. This means that fossil fuel industries are not only causing untold damage, but are on the way out and now is the time to invest in alternatives.”\nMark Hubbard chair of Bristol UNISON, who recently voted to support fossil free pensions said:\n“Bristol UNISON has 5,000 members working in Bristol City Council and hundreds of community organisations. Our members want their pension investments to be green and sustainable. We encourage Bristol City council to take a lead on this with our members’ pension providers.”\nGreen Councillor for Clifton East, Carla Denyer, who has also been actively campaigning to get the University of Bristol to go fossil free5, including tabling a motion to the University’s governance body said:\n“Divesting from fossil fuels is good for the environment and also good for all of us who want a safe and secure pension in the future. As major funds around the world move out of fossil fuels, let’s encourage our local pension provider to invest in technologies with a future: energy efficiency, renewables and energy storage.”",

We want young people to continue to enjoy the rights enjoyed by their parents and grandparents – the right to travel, study and work across Europe.\n“Like Labour, we would ditch the great repeal bill, but replace it with more than just an EU rights and protections bill. We will push for a Great Reform Bill, to deliver a fair and proportional election system, reform of the House of Lords and a written constitution. Greens believe that the best way to protect jobs and workers’ rights is by remaining in the single market.\n“Of course jobs and the economy are critically important in the negotiations with the EU, but by prioritising these above all else, there is a danger the environment gets side-lined. With the Tories plotting a bonfire of regulations that protect our air and water quality, safeguard valuable wildlife habitats and help tackle climate change, we need a new Environmental Protection Act and a new Clean Air Act to ensure environmental protections are maintained and enhanced.\n“Labour’s call for parliament to be given a truly meaningful vote on the final Brexit deal is welcome, but their reluctance to give British people the same right shows a disregard for democracy. Greens believe that the people of the UK must be given an opportunity to accept or reject the future that is on offer at the end of the two-year Article 50 process through a ratification referendum.”",

This was reiterated by Theresa May in her Brexit speech last week.\nThe petition calls on the government to work cooperatively with other EU countries on harmonising corporate tax rates across Europe and to ensure that the main rate of UK corporation tax rate is returned to a minimum of 28%. Molly said:\n“The government has no mandate to turn the UK into a tax haven post Brexit. This may be the future vision that large corporations and wealthy elites have for the UK, but it is not the future that the vast majority of those who voted remain or leave have for our country.\n“Corporations need to pay their fair share of tax to fund the infrastructure and public services we all depend on. Rather than threatening to race to the bottom on corporate tax rates, the government should instead be seeking to work cooperatively with our European partners to create a level playing field on tax.”\n“I urge everyone to sign this petition and share it widely.

  "https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_/https_bristolgreenparty_org_uk_news_checking-the-numbers-on-alternatives-to-the-bristol-arena/content_382.html": "menu\nWhat is the best use of Temple Island, should we build an arena there or are the alternatives more appealing? This is the question that Mayor Marvin Rees proposes to bring to September’s cabinet meeting with a recommendation.\nWhen this question is being addressed we would expect to see the term ‘best’ encompass social, cultural and environmental considerations as well as pure economic and employment considerations.\nHowever, looking specifically (and only) at the economic and employment considerations, Marvin has said that the best economic and employment outcome for Bristol could be to not build an arena on Temple Island. He has stated that it is difficult to walk away from the potential alternative uses of Temple Island. As a Green, I’m all for looking at the evidence on the alternative uses of Temple Island, so where do things stand on this at the moment?\nMarvin said, “I have to consider the Value for Money Report that says that… a mixed use site including a conference centre, hotel and residential brings an economic output of over 900 million pounds and over 2000 jobs.” Of course, this ‘value for money’ report had no calculations of the social, environmental and other impacts of this decision, let alone the enormous effect that rejecting a city centre arena for an out of town site would have on the city centre economy.\nYou might get the impression from listening to the Mayor that these numbers had been generated and thoroughly assessed by KPMG, who drafted the report. So where do these numbers come from and can we rely on them? Buried in the detail of the KPMG report it states, “Although alternative use plans for the Temple Island site have not yet been fully developed Bristol City Council has undertaken an initial ‘land use optioneering’ exercise to consider and develop potential options for the site.”\nSo, at this stage, it’s solely on the basis of the Council’s own obscure calculations that KPMG has noted down that a conference centre, hotel, 460 homes, and shops and offices could be fitted onto the relatively small plot of land where it is planned that the arena will be located.\nThe council then builds on these assumptions to generate some even more extravagant employment numbers. The council told KPMG that over 1800 full time jobs could result directly from the alternative Temple Island development. While the informal response to this number of jobs on this relatively small plot of land might be, “You must be having a larf!” the equivalent response of the professional services is more restrained: “KPMG has not validated Bristol City Council’s estimates of the direct employment associated with the Temple Island site.”\nIn other words, the experts engaged by the council have declined to provide professional judgement on the numbers provided by Marvin’s own staff that form the basis of any claims that alternative uses of Temple Island will generate higher employment and economic activity.\nSo in summary, at this stage, councillors and KPMG have seen no proper alternative use development plans for Temple Island – all we have is numbers from a back of the envelope style ‘land use optioneering’ exercise that has been carried out by Marvin’s staff. Even if accurate, these numbers would be insufficient to support an informed decision as they say nothing about the social, cultural or environmental impacts of the decision the Mayor faces.\nFinally, as with the vague assertions made around the Filton arena, these unverified numbers are then being repeatedly requoted and weighed against the statistics for a Temple Meads arena as if they were equally valid. Bristol deserves better than this.",

The successful amendments include:\nTogether the Green budget proposals will raise over a million pounds for the Council and secure more funding for important local services.\nResponding to the successful passing of the Green amendments, Councillor Eleanor Combley, leader of the Green Group, said:\n“I’m delighted that our budget amendments have been accepted. These are sensible, effective amendments that will reduce some of the impact of the deep cuts in Labour’s austerity budget, protect vital emergency funding for some of the poorest people in the city, and provide housing in the City for children in care with complex needs. While it is disappointing that councillors did not support all of our amendments, voting down the amendment to scrap free car parking for councillors, it is encouraging that most of our proposals have passed today.\n“This shows the value of having Green councillors in the room to propose alternatives, and with Labour taking their lead from us, this hopefully represents the start of more open thinking and cross-party working from the Mayor. The traditional tribal political games so often played by the main three parties benefits nobody but politicians.”\nBackground:\nThe amendment is to hire a planner to do research to develop policies to ensure a more balanced mix of housing types across the city, in particular to stem the rate of conversion of family homes to Houses in Multiple Occupation, which includes student lets exempt from Council tax. Last year Bristol City Council missed out on approximately £13m worth of council tax from properties that had been converted into student lets. Hiring a planner at a one off-cost of roughly £25,000 (assuming 6 months work) would support the council to act on its recent press release (https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/council-take-control-student-housing-1236284) promoting changes in the authority’s Local Plan.\nResponding to the outcome of the vote, Councillor Clive Stevens, who proposed the amendment, said:\n“I’m delighted my budget amendment on this has passed. This will help the Council to act on its Local Plan and other Planning documents, easing both the pressures on communities from continued expansion of our universities and the financial pressures on the Council through growing numbers of council tax-exempt properties.”",

Green Councillors have raised concerns that the Council risks being overenthusiastic in its support for tall buildings and needs to pay due care to the potential negative aspects of such development and respect the opinions of the public who responded to the consultation.\nGreen Councillor Martin Fodor said:\n“As a Green I’m naturally keen to see better quality places to enhance urban living, and most of what’s in this document is helpful. However, what’s worrying is the overwhelming range of views submitted by residents and civic organisations which are being ignored by the council in its apparent enthusiasm to encourage more tall buildings. There needs to be much better consideration of the many downsides of these projects, for example greater cost, worse environment for children, environmental impacts, and so on. Otherwise we risk opening the door to developers to get permission and then cut corners in corporate projects that could blight our city for decades to come.”\nThe full response by the Green councillor group is below.\nUrban Living – Bristol Green Party councillors’ submission on the formal consultation.\nWe broadly welcome the publication of new, draft Urban Living guidance for the city, and support the goal of high quality, denser developments to accommodate people and create communities.\nCreating higher density, urban living, when done well, is a positive step for the city, to support public transport and active travel and to ensure people have the choice of living closer to work, leisure, and facilities in a healthy environment.\nProvided green and blue infrastructure (natural and water-linked landscape elements such as sustainable drainage, parks and food growing land) are integrated into the city and its development, both new and existing, then the quality of life and sustainability of the city can be improved.\nWe have already made our case for a Green approach to urban living. As we said in our initial submission:\n“We do want to see high quality, well designed urban areas, with mixed uses, including employment, leisure, and play. There should be prioritisation of active travel, safe streets, healthy places, public spaces, leisure, play areas, and quiet spaces. We support a commitment to age friendly, child friendly, and all ability friendly places.\nMid rise and low rise developments can create all these with evidence of success in achieving successful, popular, and high density areas people want to live in. The evidence for tall buildings achieving all these is much more doubtful.”\nAt the same time we cited our concerns with the proposal for more tall buildings:\n“Tall buildings have extra costs and penalties for higher construction costs, slower delivery, fire safety, usable space wasted in service shafts, maintenance costs for lifts, lower recycling, higher carbon in both construction and operation eg for water pumping, the need for concierges and security, wasted land around them, and shadow and air turbulence impacts on surrounding areas.\nThere is limited evidence they would actually deliver more homes for a diversity residents, families and mixed communities on the same or less land, as traditional, popular low and medium rise areas do.\nThe urban living policies on quality and design need to be tighter, as we know many details offered in applications get lost and negotiated away before or during construction.”\nWe drew the administration’s attention in our previous submission to a report produced by government in 2001/2 – which doubts that tall buildings even produce higher densities (https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmselect/cmtlgr/482/482.pdf).\nWe now comment on the formal consultation, and point out that there seems to be an unwillingness from the Council to acknowledge the extent and depth of unpopularity across the city for the continued advocacy of tall buildings. Even in the case studies there is clearly a limitation on local evidence for the delivery of successful tall buildings in the city, with some shortcomings (cladding and entrances) being cited for the Quakers Friars tower. The absence of obvious models for successful tall buildings should add to the warning.\nThe consultation responses documented by the council should show the lack of viability for the policy:\nInvited stakeholders said: “Guidance needs to positively say where tall buildings will be encouraged whilst setting out their limitations in terms of delivering affordable housing, using land more efficiently and delivering successful placemaking. Assessment criteria will still be required.” [quotes from Consultation report]\nThe Survey and consultation results quoted show:\nIn addition: “the majority highlighting the need to expand the remit of the document to included other UK core cities and European examples. It was also commented that the document could have included more studies of tall buildings.”\nWe think this is needed and must acknowledge the many down sides that can occur with these developments.\nIt was requested:\n“The future maintenance and management of schemes should be considered at planning stage.”\nWithout this there could well be failing projects again – as with the 60s and 70s legacy of degraded and unmaintained buildings that became virtually uninhabitable in so many British cities.\nDetailed survey results:\nComments on quality standards needed suggest additional standards be introduced, with key themes set out below:\nIn summary:\nWe therefore ask the administration to think again regarding the proposed tall buildings policy. Otherwise we are concerned that the largest, corporate developers will see the opportunity to propose and get permission for minimally compliant tall buildings that will damage the city’s quality of life and risk the many problems pointed to. This, for instance, can harm mental health and wellbeing and stifle the ability of children to play and socialise, affect those suffering isolation, and also reduce the diversity of housing types achieved.\nThe Green councillors’ ambition for the city remains one of: high quality, well designed urban areas, with mixed uses, including employment, leisure, and play. There should be prioritisation of active travel, safe streets, healthy places, public spaces, leisure, play areas, and quiet spaces. We support a commitment to age friendly, child friendly, and all ability friendly places.\nMid rise and low rise developments can create all these with evidence of success in achieving successful, popular, and high density areas people want to live in. The encouragement of tall buildings will irrevocably change the skyline of Bristol. It is not something to be undertaken lightly, but only after a fuller of consideration of many potential downsides – especially in residential blocks – and widespread public concern that needs to be carefully considered.",

We have gone from just a few Councillors on Bristol City Council to be one of the biggest groups and, in 2015, we very nearly elected our first MP in the city with one of the most impressive vote increases in recent history. Darren is well known in Bristol, not just as the candidate in Bristol West in 2015, but also someone who is at the heart of the wider green movement. Darren is well liked and respected by a wide range of partners in the region and I am delighted to see him as our candidate for this incredibly important Metro Mayor position.”\nHe continued, “The newly elected Metro Mayor is going to have huge sway over Bristol and the surrounding region’s housing, transport and sustainability planning.

However, when asked for their views on tall buildings, 68% were against them while just over 10% thought they were ‘good’.

Essentially, I feel I have been played.”\nCouncillor Bolton added that the original approval included plans for a ‘green wall’, a proposal for a local market and an amphitheatre – all seemingly now gone.\nSteve Clarke, the other Green Party Councillor for the area, said:\n“I absolutely agree that we need more homes for people in Bristol (especially affordable ones) but I am concerned about the massing and scale of the proposed developments and also about the potential lack of social infrastructure such as schools, doctors and dentists for these thousands of new residents in our ward. In fact, it’s not proven that very tall buildings are the best way to deliver higher density accommodation – taller buildings require more land and space. Despite all its skyscrapers New York still has a lower density than cities like Paris and Barcelona.”\nA government report from a few years ago found that tall buildings ‘do not necessarily deliver higher densities’. Current proposals in Bedminster are for between 1200 and 1500 units, and include 22 storey blocks, and other very tall buildings. Greens believe developers have been encouraged by supportive words from the Labour Mayor (e.g. this press release) and the Council’s ‘Urban Living SPD’ (Supplementary Planning Document) which promotes tall buildings.",

This helps to counteract the fact that Council Tax itself is regressive (it costs poorer people a larger proportion of their income than richer people).\nHowever, the Conservatives’ proposal would reduce the help that low income households receive – effectively landing them with a big tax rise.\nCouncillor Carla Denyer, who has long spoken out to protect the Council Tax Reduction Scheme, including a statement to cabinet in July 2016 , explained;\n“This horribly regressive proposal doesn’t stand in isolation, it’s part of a pattern. Last year the Greens proposed a 2% council tax precept to fund adult social care, after seeing and making repeated warnings about the massive hole in the budget. We did this at a time when none of the other parties nor the then mayor were brave enough to risk proposing the Adult Social Care precept themselves, in an election year. When we proposed the precept, we were clear that such a large rise in tax would only be acceptable if the Council Tax Reduction Scheme was maintained, to protect the very poorest.\n“The Conservatives voted against the Adult Social Care precept, and when it passed despite their opposition, they then voted against the whole budget because of it. This year the precept (now 3%) is already included in the Mayor’s budget, and I wouldn’t be surprised if the Conservatives therefore vote against the budget again this year.\n“And yet, this latest Tory amendment demonstrates loud and clear that they aren’t opposed to all tax rises, they’re only opposed to tax rises that affect the rich. This amendment would mean a significant tax rise for the very poorest in the city. Whatever you think about how to balance the budget overall, and whether the austerity agenda is justified, there is no excuse for knowingly targeting the city’s very poorest citizens with a policy that will make them even poorer.”\nCouncillor Fi Hance, the Green Party member on the Council’s Cabinet, added,\n“The Conservative amendment is a self-defeating proposal in that it would almost certainly cost as much as it saves. Many of the families and individuals impacted by the cut will simply not be able to afford to pay. As a result they are likely go into arrears with the Council, or become homeless, both of which will cost the Council more in the long run and put even more pressure on budgets such as Adult Social Care”\nIf the Conservative amendment is passed at Tuesday’s meeting, it will still be subject to a public consultation before it can be brought into force for the financial year 2018/19.

We need action over this public health emergency, and businesses and local residents need certainty about what the changes will be so that they can make decisions and plan for the future.\nIn their announcement last week, the Labour administration was quick to lay the blame entirely at the government’s door. However, it was the Mayor’s choice to proceed with a plan for a complicated and confusing hybrid option, with both a diesel ban and charging zone – something we warned at the time was unworkable and risky.\nThat decision then led to further tinkering to try to make the confusing proposal hang together, as the Mayor made changes to exempt access to Cabot circus and the Portway. Can we be surprised if government is slow to respond to a plan that keeps changing?\nI have no doubt that this Conservative government lacks commitment over air quality, as they do over most environmental issues, but while Bristol has delayed other cities have been getting on with it. For example, Birmingham has a Clean Air Zone, complete with exemptions and support for those who will find it difficult to make the change, ready to go live this summer.\nWe now know that, globally, dirty air is now causing more deaths than smoking, and each year in Bristol, hundreds of deaths and many more episodes of ill health are caused by air pollution. Too many children in our city are growing up with asthma and poor lung development from toxic air. The Mayor needs to take action on this instead of looking for excuses.",

She says a Conservative government will be encouraged to follow suit post-Brexit and create ‘tax haven Britain’:\n“This is a highly aggressive move by Trump, but also a canny one. Swinging a sharp axe to corporation tax will encourage US corporations to bring home profits that have been held offshore, which will increase tax yields in the short run. This will provide a boost to infrastructure investment, paying the bill for the wall he wants to build between the US and Mexico for example. However, in the long term this drastic cut, which will lead to an estimated $2.2 trillion loss in revenue, will leave the country unable to provide even the meagre services to its citizens that it currently does.\n“Such a move by Trump will further motivate the Conservatives to create tax haven Britain post-Brexit and encourage a global race to the bottom on tax rates. Already we have seen proposals from the Tories to reduce corporation tax rates to as low as 12.5% [3].\n“In the past, the US has unilaterally created new standards that then became international positions, such as obliging the automatic exchange of tax information. Today’s move shows the US is now unilaterally moving to reduce international standards and encourage a race to the bottom.

They have expressed hope that a new committee-led administration, who will be responsible for implementing the budget after May, will put communities at the heart of any future budget setting process.\nCllr Heather Mack, Shadow Cabinet Lead for Finance, Performance and Governance, voiced her concerns about the original budget, saying, “Make no mistake, the Labour and Conservative parties have worked together on a backroom budget that works against the people of Bristol, continuing austerity and the degradation of our frontline services.\n“In the meeting, the Mayor said that we have no choice but to work within the fiscal context we’re in. Of course – but if their party hopes to run the country, they will have the power to change this context. Yet both locally and nationally, Labour has said that they would not provide any more funding for local councils than the Tories have done: Labour complicity in Tory austerity.\n“We still have huge concerns about this budget, including the overspend of the Direct Schools Grant and the impact this has on children and their families in trying to access SEND provision. A Labour cabinet member claimed that no child would suffer, and I find this hard to believe. On top of this, we have concerns about the squeeze on adult social care, especially at a time of increased demand, and how this will affect those that rely on the council to provide this essential service.”\n“We hope that the Bristol Labour and Conservative Groups will join us in lobbying their national party leadership for the funding necessary to protect these crucial areas.”\nThe Green Group also voiced their concerns about the new Tory amendments. Cllr Martin Fodor, who has been speaking to allotment holders and site reps across the city regarding the recently proposed changes to rules and rent increases, said,\n“The chaos and confusion continues for allotment holders. The recent consultation process was a complete mess, and speaking to allotment holders from across the city, I have seen the negative impact that these proposals have had on their lives.\n“The allotment amendment means there will still be no inflation rise in allotment fees this year, just as there hasn’t been since they were frozen in 2018. It’s clear from Cabinet papers that they will still rise in 2025 and again in 2026 to what was originally proposed, as always planned by the Labour administration. This short term relief for plot holders does not address the fact the service has been cut by austerity and suffered as a result. The inflationary increase agreed in 2018 and never implemented by this administration would have reduced the decline in these vital facilities.\n“This is another neglected service being left for the next administration to try and rescue with a proper stakeholder dialogue and process.”\nOn the amendment to bring forward and spend proceeds from the Clean Air Zone (CAZ) to subsidise car parks and road repairs, Cllr David Wilcox, shadow cabinet lead for Transport and Active Travel said,\n“Spending CAZ money on subsidising car parks and road repairs, which will incentivise car use and increase air pollution, does not fit in with the strict government rules on what this money can be spent on. So this amendment will not be implemented. On top of this, bringing the spending of CAZ money forward as proposed will probably not be possible because it relies on extra staff resource that simply doesn’t exist.\nSpeaking on what Greens would do differently in any committee-led administration, Green Group Leader Emma Edwards said,\n“After eight years, the outgoing Labour administration has run out of ideas. The Bristol Green Party manifesto will lay out our clear, innovative policies for the city that we desperately need. Part of this will be securing more funding through measures that can also tackle the climate crisis directly, like a corporate parking levy and investing money to save.”\n“In May, Bristol will be introducing a collaborative, committee-led system. This will allow the budget process to work with Councillors from all parties throughout the year, to prioritise essential services, care for the most vulnerable in society, and work hard to protect people from austerity.\n“We are also starting to sit down with officers to discuss ideas they may have not been able to implement under this administration, and we look forward to working with them to find innovative solutions to the problems that Bristol faces.\n“Having got rid of the Mayoral role, the people of Bristol can now choose to put communities first and foremost rather than bailing out big businesses, funding failed vanity projects, and chasing a failed model of economic growth that led us into this mess in the first place.”\n“While this budget has been passed today, the real vote on how Bristol’s finances are spent in the future will come when the people of Bristol head to the polls in May.”\nCllr Heather Mack is the Deputy Leader of Bristol City Council\nMore about HeatherCllr Martin Fodor is the Chair of the Environment and Sustainability Committee\nMore about MartinCllr David Wilcox is the Green Group Whip\nMore about DavidCllr Emma Edwards is the Leader of the Green Group on Bristol City Council\nMore about Emma",

She points to research showing nearly two thirds of the British population live in towns and cities where air pollution levels breach EU legal limits [2] and that toxic air is responsible for an estimated 40,000 premature deaths every year [3]. In Bristol alone, 300 deaths a year are linked to air pollution [4].\nThe Green Party’s air pollution plan includes a Clean Air Act which would enshrine the right to breathe clean air in law; expanding ‘Clean Air Zones’ which would limit the most polluting vehicles entering Bristol and large scale investment in clean public transport. Molly Scott Cato MEP said:\n“Clean air isn’t a luxury, it’s a basic human right. Given that more deaths in Bristol are linked with toxic air than road traffic accidents, this is a health emergency. Air pollution is a particular threat to children as it restricts lung growth and can therefore have life-long impacts. No way should children in Bristol be forced to walk through a toxic soup to get to school or be prevented from playing outdoors because the air quality is so bad.\n“It is nothing short of scandalous that Tory Minsters show such a shocking disregard for the UK’s legal and moral obligation to take action on air pollution. Even more outrageous that they sought to use the general election as a smokescreen for inaction and to cover up their total failure to protect public health [4].\n“Thanks to EU regulations on air quality, the European Commission and environmental lawyers have been able to drag the government through the courts and force them to publish a plan of action. However, we cannot breathe easy over the proposals [5] as they are likely to prevent cities like Bristol from creating clean air zones. The Tories have constantly tried to water down regulations on pollution in Europe and have a dangerously cosy relationship with the car manufacturing industry and its lobbyists.”\n“The Conservative government begrudgingly acknowledges that any positive air quality action it has been forced to take has been driven by EU law. Given how gung-ho many Tories are about tearing up EU environmental legislation post-Brexit, it is essential we have a Clean Air Act to ensure future UK governments cannot avoid their moral and environmental responsibilities to tackle our toxic air.”\nBristol Green Party has also developed a plan to specifically tackle Bristol’s poor air quality [6] and more than 4,000 people have signed a ‘Let Bristol Breathe’ petition, supported by Molly Scott Cato, which calls for the establishment of a Clean Air Zone in the city [7].\nNotes\n[1] a comprehensive Air Quality Plan should include.\nClean Air Act: It should rapidly introduce a new Clean Air Act to tackle the sources of modern day air pollution that are harming people’s health, enshrine the right to breathe into UK law, and ensure the UK becomes a world leader in the new technologies and industries that will help us clean up our air.\nExpand ‘Clean Air Zones’: It should expand and strengthen the network of Clean Air Zones across the country – limiting the most polluting vehicles, including cars, from entering air pollution hot-spots – creating funding for local authorities to invest in walking, cycling and clean public transport. These should be strong enough to ensure legal compliance on NO2 by the end of 2018.\nIncrease VED: It should increase the first year Vehicle Excise Duty on new diesel vehicles (except vans) by around £800, to reflect the additional cost to society of dirty diesel engines, raising £500m to help fund a targeted diesel scrappage scheme.\nDiesel Scrappage: It should introduce a targeted diesel scrappage scheme to take diesel vehicles off the road as soon as possible, and ensure that all those who live within Clean Air Zones can affordably replace polluting diesel vehicles. As well as offering replacement clean vehicles, these schemes should also offer alternatives such as car club membership and rail season tickets.\nNote: Despite a $10bn vehicle replacement programme in the United States, VW has only embarked upon an opaque programme of ‘technical fixes’ on its 1.2 million vehicles in the UK . The Greens, working through UK regulators, would ensure that VW and others offer free vehicle replacement or retrofitting – as has happened in the United States.\nFine the Cheats: It should set out a plan for how companies who cheated emissions testing would be fined. Despite a $14.7bn settlement in the US, Volkswagen, for example, has yet to pay any damages in the EU – an equivalent fine in the UK could raise more than £8 billion from VW alone.\nIndependent Regulation: It should guarantee the independence of the Vehicle Certification Agency – changing the way it is funded ensuring that the car industry doesn’t have a disproportionate influence on its activities.\nMonitor Pollution Hotspots: It should ensure there is a comprehensive network of air monitoring stations in pollution hotspots – ensuring that air quality is monitored around hospitals, health clinics, and schools, so that those who are most vulnerable to the impacts of air pollution, notably children, the elderly and infirm, are protected.\nActive Transport: It should undertake a national review of transport system with serious investment in buses, trams and trains along with safe routes for walking and cycling. People need an alternative to car use and we must protect our towns, cities and countryside from the pollution and congestion that comes with new roads.\nClean Energy:. It should scale-up investment in renewable energy – which, as it stands, is set to drop by 95% over next two years. Harnessing the clean energy that we have in abundance would be a win-win, both for tackling climate change and air pollution.\nDitch Coal: It should should bring forward the coal phaseout date to 2023 at the least, and gradually end the £6bn a year subsidies in the UK to dirty energy. Pollution from the UK’s coal-fired fleet causes roughly 2,900 premature deaths a year.\nHOW SHOULD THIS BE FUNDED?\nThere are no cheap fixes when it comes to cleaning up the air we breathe: the long term solution is to completely change the way we travel to reduce the traffic on our roads. Further, any action we take now will relieve pressure on our health services in the future, and reduce the £20bn cost of dirty air – as calculated by the Royal College of Physicians. As noted above, the Air Quality Plan should ensure that car companies who cheated emissions are appropriately fined, and that such levies are used to fund action on air quality. UK regulators – namely, the Competition and Markets Authority, the Vehicle Certification Agency, and the Serious Fraud Office – should force car manufacturers in the UK to replace or retrofit polluting diesel vehicles.\n[3] http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35629034\n[5] http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/05/02/diesel-drivers-will-paid-scrap-cars-improve-air-quality/\n[6] http://www.bristolgreenparty.org.uk/library/Bristols_Air_poster_proof1.pdf\n[7] https://you.38degrees.org.uk/petitions/let-bristol-breathe-clean-air",

Totally beats yours #Sheffield ? pic.twitter.com/FYYSETSsXI\n— BBC Radio Bristol (@bbcrb) May 23, 2018\nCleo, who is the 11th female Lord Mayor in the 800 year legacy of the position paid homage to her family, teachers and community.\n“I am bringing some changes to this position” she said. “I am different from my predecessors. I am a dancer. For the last 10 years I have been a dance leader for the most incredible group of people – the Malcolm X elders forum – many of them are here today.”\n“It is of course an absolute honour to my elders and my communitry at large to see me here as first citizen of Bristol the same year as we celebrate 50 years of the St Paul’s Carnival and 70 years since Windrush docked.”\nTo applause from across the chamber, Cleo promised to bring dance back into city hall, challenging longstanding councillors to share their cha-cha-cha and flamenco in a ‘mosh pit of politicians’ fit for a strictly come council before concluding:\n“I honestly believe that Bristol can be a beacon and lead the way in how we can co-exist together and be part of a collective narrative.”\n“I am so proud of my city”."
