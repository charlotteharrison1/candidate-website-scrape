Christ, though completely innocent of any charge, was on a straight path to the most appalling, shameful and excruciatingly painful end to his earthly life.\nHow, therefore, could he be telling his first followers and, by extension, all of us who came after, that we should pray for victory on this earth that was about to claim his blood in death on a Roman cross?\nAnd it is here that our world view is challenged to the extreme. We are called and encouraged to see things from another perspective, that enables us to look ahead, through the battles, to victory.\nIn our daily praying, living and practical action, much of it routine, mundane, ordinary and not particularly world changing, we are to live with our eyes fixed, as it were, on “the cross”.\nNot because this is a symbol of death but of resurrection life.\nThat is an absolute truth for the followers of Jesus Christ, because when we think of “the cross” it encompasses more than his violent and unspeakably cruel execution to act as a substitute for all of our breaches of God’s law.\nThe term “the cross” brings to mind the wooden structure to which Christ was nailed through his hands and his feet. however, when we refer to “the cross” now while we might think of the symbol of that “old rugged cross”, we are speaking of a concept that is much bigger in every sense.\nWhen we think of and look to “the cross”, with the benefit of 2000 years of hindsight, in our minds eye we can capture an awesome vista in addition to that bloody scene of a man dying nailed to two pieces of wood.\nWe also see an empty tomb, a divine man who came back from having been among the dead in Hades; who was seen physically by perhaps thousands of contemporary eye witnesses, who returned to his place of supreme authority, as Co-Regent with God our Almighty Father, directing all of time and eternity towards their predetermined outcome.\nIn the face of all of our challenges as we look to “the cross” we are in fact “looking unto Jesus.“\nSo this is our world view: since Jesus, Messiah, King of the universe, Saviour of all humanity made it clear to his followers that, despite his trajectory towards the violent ending of his life, we should pray for and work towards victory.\nThis means that the full force of the Godhead, Father, Son and Holy Spirit, is directed to and through us so that we may play our part in bringing about his purpose on Earth.\nLet’s pursue victory as Christians in the face of all challenges!",

I will open up the corridors of power to The People so that The State never again can dictate to you.\"\nChan Abraham is well-known as a business and community leader serving this area since 1996 WITH A PUBLIC RECORD OF SAVING HUNTINGDONSHIRE FROM LABOUR's DISASTROUS POLICIES AND CONSERVATIVES' MISMANAGEMENT when he introduced initiatives that transformed the quality of life, including giving local people a voice, better housing services and helping public organisations to work in partnership for the benefit of all, instead of wasting public resources.\nIn 1999 he personally led the area's largest public consultation through scores of open meetings with tenants of HDC's badly neglected 8,000 council homes, independently raising £100 million to buy and repair them. Tenants voted overwhelmingly to become part of non-profit HHP-Luminus that he founded, enjoying a better future with low rents, improved repairs, new neighbourhood services and genuine People Power through seats on the Management Board. He gave HDC a windfall of more than £65 million strictly requiring better local services but this vast sum 'disappeared' into a financial black hole of the Conservative-LibDem-Labour-run council.\nAs Director of Community Services he introduced improvements to Huntingdonshire’s leisure services, parks, culture and tourism, established Town Centre Management for Huntingdon (now BID Huntingdon), Community Safety Partnerships across Cambridgeshire so Police, NHS and other public services could work together; and helped release much-needed Hinchingbrooke Hospital beds saving the NHS substantial sums of public money by providing homes for older patients to receive nursing care in the community.\nRecognised as The Man of the People he held Saturday morning conferences and consultation events and kept an open door to all. Government bureaucrats bristled with hubris and jealousy over his innovation, commitment to local people and independent thought, and tried undermine and sabotage his efforts, but he kept his Guarantee to tenants. Luminus was recognised nationally as an example of excellent customer care and staff motivation, twice hitting the No. 2 spot on The Sunday Times 100 Best Companies to Work For, winning the Gold Medal for Health & Safety from The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents for 13 consecutive years and garnering more awards for excellence and inspiration than any other UK business.\nThrough his Leadership Academy he has trained, developed and mentored hundreds of managers and leaders in councils, Police, businesses and charities, helping many women and men progress to senior jobs. He helped build Huntingdon's Community Radio Studio in Huntingdon Town Centre, initiated extensive community projects including Oxmoor's Maple Centre and NHS Oak Tree Centre; new family, key worker, extra care and sheltered housing; established multi-agency health and children's safeguarding initiatives and apprenticeship schemes for young people; served communities on Mental Health Trust and Schools Governing Boards. and set up two new Charities with the theme of “Inspiring hope, changing lives, transforming our world”.\nContact\nTo be part of this revolution in British politics please contact us",

Only truly Independent leaders, including MPs, working together for The People and not the interests of corporations, ideologies or other countries, can bring about the radical change that now is so desperately needed.\nThey have mismanaged our money, removed our freedoms, created despair\nDespite paying a whopping £695 billion in taxes British people are suffering MORE sickness and mental health problems; millions of us on hospital waiting lists will die without treatment; children, women, older and other vulnerable people are suffering domestic abuse; lawlessness and anti-social behaviour are soaring, while crime detection is appallingly low.\nChildren are being indoctrinated in our schools not educated; free speech and Human Rights are being trampled on; families and communities are falling apart; traditional British Values are despised; people are criminalised for their thoughts and there’s a general sense of hopelessness, resignation and despair.\nMisery for ordinary Brits gets worse every day\nWhile we have been deprived of homes, food, care for elderly and disabled people and life’s basic necessities politicians have “laundered” c.£20 billion dragging us into a a foreign conflict that doesn't concern us. More than116,000 illegal Channel crossings since 2018 (in 2024), predominantly by those with no allegiance to, or respect for Britain's heritage, customs and values, have introduced pressures and risks within communities. Our living costs are unaffordable and young people have no hope of their own home. Farmers are under threat creating a food crisis, hard-working people rely for survival on foodbanks and a war on our cars is restricting travelling for work, school, hospital and home care for elderly and disabled. Climate alarmism and an utterly nonsensical dash towards \"Net Zero\" is destroying our economy, countryside, wildlife and our children's and grandchildren's future - while making a few elites very, very rich.\nOur Parliament run by wealthy people and career politicians created this mess; they didn’t consult us and we never voted for any of what they have done.\nAll political parties have failed the British people - no point voting Tory, Labour, Lib Dem, Greens...they’re the Uniparty\nWe are poorer, sicker, less safe, paying more for fuel, food and local services. Politicians have neglected Britain’s systems for healthcare, protection of children, care of older people education, policing, immigration, courts, prisons, roads and transport. Government has steadily removed our freedoms, invaded our privacy and trampled our Human Rights. All without asking us.\nPolitical parties, decaying past their shelf life, in lockstep with each other, are influenced by the super-rich and corporations, a selfish, greedy minority who despise and want us as their slaves. Remember the massive cost of lockdowns to our health, our children, elderly and economy? While we all suffered, 500 new billionaires were created through the “pandemic”. This must be halted.",

His association with the well-known, deceased, serial abuser of children #JimmySaville and Starmer’s decision as #DirectorofPublicProsecutions not to bring #Saville to justice continue to cast a long shadow over him.\nBut it is Starmer’s record of actions against The British People who he is appointed to serve, his exposure of UK Citizens to grave risks from his failure to secure our borders, exporting of taxpayers’ money abroad, engagement in a foreign conflict that does not concern this nation and his destructive economic and social policies, that land him in the dock in The Court of Public Opinion.\nWill the coming years show Starmer as both the #worstPM in UK history and the first to be prosecuted for his actions and omissions?\nMany commentators are providing excellent perspective on Starmer’s time in office and Gary Dixon’s on LinkedIn is one of these, quoted in full below, with thanks to Gary.\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n“Keir Starmer has done it. He has truly outdone himself. In a political landscape already suffering from chronic mediocrity and visionless leadership, Starmer has taken the Labour Party and chiselled it into the most anti-business, economically clueless, and politically tone-deaf monstrosity Britain has seen since the days when Gordon Brown thought he’d ended boom and bust. But at least Brown could count.\nStarmer, meanwhile, seems to think business is some sort of disease to be eradicated. Profit is a dirty word. Entrepreneurs are enemies of the state. And growth, that pesky little concept, is only acceptable if it happens in a government spreadsheet and never in real life.\nHis speeches are full of empty corporate jargon picked up from someone’s LinkedIn post, but the policies reek of suspicion and hostility towards anyone who’s ever created a job, taken a risk, or balanced a set of accounts.\nThe man talks about wealth creation while plotting new ways to tax it into extinction. He claims Labour is open for business while ensuring every signal sent out screams ‘run for your life’. Starmer’s Labour treats private enterprise the way a cat treats a mouse.\nWith feigned interest, cruel detachment, and an inevitable pounce. His fantasy economics read like a student union manifesto, lovingly dusted off from 1983 and sprayed with cologne called ‘credibility’. Spoiler alert it still stinks.\nInvestors are leaving. Founders are dreading. Farmers are panicking. Wealth is fleeing faster than a Labour MP at a straight question.\nBut in Starmer’s alternate reality, all is well. The problem, you see, is not that businesses are under attack. It is that businesses aren’t doing enough social good. As if employing people, paying wages, and driving the economy somehow don’t qualify as moral acts.\nApparently, companies must now also solve inequality, climate change, tooth decay, and loneliness, all while politely accepting punitive taxes and endless regulation from people who’ve never run a lemonade stand.\nAnd let’s not forget his legendary charisma vacuum. The only thing more uninspiring than Starmer’s delivery is his content. If leadership was measured in passion, Starmer would be a glass of lukewarm water. If economic literacy was currency, Labour would be bankrupt twice.\nHe has turned Labour into the party of envy, suspicion, and middle management moralism lecturing in why business is evil from a man who wouldn’t last five minutes in the real economy. Well done, Keir. You have redefined failure and heading for the exit and take the cabinet rabble with you.”",

As far as the many residents of Oxmoor are concerned – Chan is already our local hero.\"\n\"Chan leads us in a culture based on trust, where all our staff are part of the family. We work in an environment where, passion, pride, courage and integrity are part of who we are and the way we do things. Chan models this behaviour, leading us in changing ourselves and in making the difference where we are. Chan cares about each and every one of his employees. He knows each one of us and will often walk through the office asking how our family members are (by name) and we know that we truly are members of the family.\"\n\"Chan’s focus covers all staff as everyone can meet with Chan if they need guidance or advice. Chan has taken a personal interest in my family and supported me when my wife developed breast cancer.\"\n\"Over the years I have been with Luminus I have lost count of the times our people have said how moved they have been by Chan’s personal commitment to their well-being. This ranges from a personal birthday card from Chan to every staff member, a kind word or two about a family member at a chance meeting in a corridor and offers of financial assistance and personal mentoring when any one of our people are facing a personal or family problem.\"\n\"As a tenant on the Board closely involved I can state that much of what has been achieved could not have taken place without the vision and drive that Chan has consistently provided.\"\n\"I just want to say how grateful me and my daughter…are with the financial aid Chan gave her from the Joseph & Alice Foundation, (which he set up in memory of his parents) and funded personally to help people in need. Without his help she wouldn’t have been able to continue with her hairdressing course at Huntingdonshire Regional College. She talks about the help Chan has given her all the time and has nothing but praise for him. He has given her the chance to make something of her life and we will be forever grateful.\"\n\"Hello Chan you will be supported by me and friends. As not many of you will not know the kindness and understanding of Chan goes back a very long way. When my brother was killed in a car crash and Chan gave me all the time in the world to go home to Ireland and was very very understanding of my grief and my Families sorrow. Not only that he is a great kind compassionate Man. Thank you Chan. It would be truly lovely to have you in Parliament. God Bless\"\n“Leaders above all others can create the conditions for people to flourish.\nSadly, most British politicians put ambition for personal enrichment, fame and power above their duty to The People.\nI will be part of a new Parliament that, with your help, will Change Britain for Good.”"
