  "https_www_esthermcvey_com_/https_www_esthermcvey_com_news_esther-mcvey-mp-speaks-about-impact-iht-changes-farming/content_18.html": "Esther McVey has re-iterated her call for Labour to drop its ‘brutal Family Farm Tax’ which will devastate family farms in Tatton and across the UK.\nThe Tatton MP Esther said her local farmers were extremely worried about what this change to inheritance tax would do to them.\nSpeaking in a debate in Parliament on the impact changes will have on farmers, Ms McVey said: “This brutal change to inheritance tax, let’s call it what it is - a family farm tax - will destroy family farms and will destroy farming in the UK as we know it. It makes a nonsense of Labour believing in UK food security and government need to U turn straight away.\n“The question I am being asked now by my farmers is, did this policy come about because they did not know what they were doing and a lack of knowledge by the Labour Party about the farming community or will we look back at this and see it for what it is, theft by the state of land from private owners.”\nMs McVey has been vocal in her opposition since the changes were announced and has repeatedly called for government to drop the policy.\nFrom next April farms worth more than £1million will no longer be exempt from paying inheritance tax (when passing on landholdings to family). Previously, they were given a tax break under Agricultural Property Relief (APR).\nThe Tatton MP said it is clear the Labour Party does not understand farmers or the industry and hold incorrect views that all farmers are “rich” and will be able to find the cash to pay the tax bill.\nShe added: “Farmers have been clear, they are asset rich, cash poor. The money to pay huge sums in inheritance tax is not there and the only way to raise that money is to sell off land. That then throws the future of the businesses into jeopardy because there may not be enough land to continue farming on. There is a complete lack of understanding from government over this, both in terms of land needed to farm and also what this would do to food security, food prices and the industry as a whole.\n“There is also the question of whether government know exactly what it is doing or simply want land back. This is what some of my local farmers believe.”\nGovernment claims only the biggest farms will be affected, a claim strongly disputed by farmers up and down the country. It is estimated that just 100 acres of land could be enough land to reach the threshold. Farmers say to make a business viable upwards of 200 acres are needed and for many that runs into thousands of acres.",

  "https_www_esthermcvey_com_/https_www_esthermcvey_com_news_esther-mcvey-mp-joins-independent-inquiry-set-look-grooming-gangs/content_2.html": "Esther McVey has joined an independent panel of experts looking into grooming gangs in the UK.\nThe Rape Gang Inquiry has been set up by Great Yarmouth MP Rupert Lowe in response to what he said are government “failings”. The inquiry will look at what happened, how it happened, and why it was allowed to happen.\nMs McVey said: “I commend Rupert Lowe for setting up this inquiry. As someone who started my life in care and given that many of the victims were also in that situation, I feel very strongly about how they were let down. They need someone to give them a voice and I will do everything I can to help.”\nIn January Government announced plans for a nationwide review of grooming gang evidence, along with five government-backed local inquiries. But this week it faced more accusations of “watering down” and “backtracking” on its proposals for inquiries after Home Office Minister Jess Philips told MPs the £5 million funding announced for the local inquiries will now be handed over to the areas to spend as they see fit.\nMs McVey said: “What Government is doing, is absolutely appalling. It lets the very councils that failed victims decide what to do (with the money).\n“This is massive miscarriage of justice that needs addressing - not only do the perpetrators need to be brought to justice - but those in authority who turned a blind eye allowing it to continue need to held to account as well.”\nIn 2022 a seven-year inquiry into child sexual abuse was completed. Led by child protection expert Professor Alex Jay, The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse found institutional failings and tens of thousands of victims across England and Wales. It described child sexual abuse as an “epidemic” across the two nations.",

She has now met with the Health Minister to discuss what more can be done to safeguard patients.\nMs McVey said: “We owe it to Olivia’s family and other families who have suffered to get this right. Changing packaging will not take away from GP advice, nor replace patient information leaflets but act as another layer of safeguarding. I would welcome this simple change as patients may not fully take in what the doctor is saying, or read the leaflet in detail but at the very least, it would ensure this warning was seen every time that box is picked up.\n“It was a very constructive meeting, and we will meet again in the coming weeks and months. There is now an expert working group being set up to look at the issue, to see what else can be done in addition to package labelling, and it has my full backing.”\nThe Royal College of Psychiatrists suggests that between one third and one half of people who take anti-depressant medications will experience some form of withdrawal, albeit in varying degrees.\nOlivia was prescribed Citalopram in November 2020 for anxiety but in June 2021 she began stopping the medication. She suffered extreme withdrawal symptoms which led to her taking her own life in September 2021.",
  "https_www_esthermcvey_com_/https_www_esthermcvey_com_news_esther-mcvey-talks-debate-about-effect-budget-successful-family-businesses/content_12.html": "Esther McVey has launched a scathing attack on government claiming Chancellor Rachel Reeves’ economic decisions will sound the death knell for family businesses and enterprise in the UK.\nThe Tatton MP said despite wanting to be remembered as the country’s first female Chancellor, Ms Reeves’ legacy would be as “Grim Reeves Reaper”.\nMs McVey said many businesses in Tatton have spanned five generations, survived through the most difficult times including two world wars, but are clear that “this Chancellor’s Budget will be the death of them.”\nChanges announced in the Budget included an increase in employer National Insurance Contributions, as well as an increase in minimum wage – which affect all businesses. But the country’s 5.3 million family-owned businesses were dealt a further blow with changes to Business Property Relief which could see many having to pay inheritance tax for the first time in 50 years.\nSpeaking in a Parliamentary opposition day debate on family businesses, Ms McVey said: “The Labour Government show no sign of understanding business, let alone family businesses that employ 14 million people and add £575 billion to the economy.\n“A family business I spoke to said, “We are already working on small profit margins. We do not know how we will cope. The enormity of the changes will change the way we look at our business. What are we going to do? We might have to carve up the business, sell it or close it down.”\nMs McVey said family businesses were also the breeding ground for entrepreneurs and government will “kill” that entrepreneurial spirit as well as see jobs lost in local communities.\nAccording to CBI Economics there could be 125,000 jobs lost and a reduction in economic activity of £9.4 billion between 2026/27 and 2029/30 because of changes to BPR. Business leaders have also warned of less or no investment as firms struggle to pay tax bills, resulting in stifled growth.\nMs McVey added: “The death of a family member could now spell the death of a family business too.\n“Labour’s raid on family businesses, worth about £500 million by 2030—that is the Treasury’s forecast—will actually lose billions of pounds more. These tax changes are ideologically driven, and the Chancellor is killing the geese that lay the golden eggs. There is a vacuum of business know-how and business knowledge among those on the Government Benches. What they are doing to our country is an utter disgrace.”\nGovernment claims the changes will only impact the biggest and wealthiest businesses. Ms McVey strongly disputes the claim, and said government liked to spin that rhetoric in the same way it did with winter fuel payments, farming inheritance taxes, and VAT on private schools.",

  "https_www_esthermcvey_com_/https_www_esthermcvey_com_news_closing-waste-recycling-centres-rubbish-idea-cheshire-east-council-says-esther-mcvey-mp/content_19.html": "Esther writes in this week's Knutsford Guardian:\nThe latest debacle in Cheshire East’s mismanagement involves closing recycling centres – you couldn’t make this rubbish up!\nThis is the council that claims it wants to encourage more people to recycle. However, its policies and proposals to date are a far cry from that.\nIt now wants to close three of the seven household, waste, and recycling centres (HWRCs) across the area.\nA consultation is currently underway which could see Bollington, Middlewich, and Poynton sites closed. Our Knutsford site has escaped the cull – but I never take anything for granted where this council is concerned and therefore have submitted my opposition both as part of the consultation and have also written to them setting out my objections.\nI hope others will do the same. Just a couple of months ago we succeeded in keeping Knutsford Leisure Centre open – a real testament to people power. The council wanted to close the much-loved facility but we fought against it and won. I hope we can support our fellow Cheshire residents in this latest fight.\nThe consultation sets out four options and what it believes to be the pros and cons of each. Firstly A - keep all sites open, B - close Poynton, C - close Bollington and D - close all three sites. If all three sites are closed the council say there will be an estimated 21 per cent increase in traffic in Knutsford.\nMy loyalty will always be to Tatton and its residents and this is a significant increase in traffic which will create more noise and pollution.\nThis Labour-led council has no foresight – just last year it scrapped green bins for all households and said either pay for a bin or take your garden waste to the dump. The very dumps they are now proposing to close!\nI also doubt they have thought about the increase in fly-tipping closing sites could cause. That will create more costs to the council and ultimately local taxpayers. I really hope people will take part in the consultation and we can get this plan thrown out with the rubbish for want of a better phrase – and make it clear we want the centres kept open.\nPeople can take part in the consultation until June 16 by filling in the survey online at https://surveys.cheshireeast.gov.uk/s/HWRC24/ or by obtaining a hard copy at any library. Alternatively, people can call customer services on 0300 123 55 00 and the council say feedback will be logged and included."
