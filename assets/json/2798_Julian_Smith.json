The call for evidence is an opportunity for residents to share their views and help improve cancer prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and care.\nThe Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) is seeking input from individuals and organisations to inform the development of the national cancer plan. The consultation covers various aspects of cancer care, including prevention, access, early diagnosis, treatment, living with and beyond cancer, and research and development. The goal is to reduce the number of lives lost to cancer and improve outcomes for patients.\nCommenting, Julian said: \"I strongly encourage everyone in our community to take part in this important consultation. Your feedback is important in shaping the future of cancer care in England. By participating, you can help ensure that the national cancer plan addresses the needs and concerns of patients and their families.\"\nThe call for evidence closes at 11:59pm on 29 April 2025.

Despite concerted efforts by Julian, the GMB Union, North Yorkshire Council, Cllr David Staveley and the North Yorkshire and York Mayor David Skaith, to propose viable alternatives, Arla has decided to proceed with relocating operations to Lockerbie in Scotland.\nFollowing the announcement of the proposed closure in February, Julian has been advocating for alternative business cases to keep Arla in North Yorkshire and has consistently raised concerns about the impact of such closures on the local community.\nCommenting on the news, Julian said, “This decision by Arla is a huge blow to the workers at the Settle Creamery and the wider community. The loss of 130 skilled jobs will have a significant impact on our local economy and the livelihoods of many families. I have been actively involved in discussions with Arla, North Yorkshire Council and North Yorkshire Mayor, David Skaith, the GMB Union, Cllr David Staveley and local authorities to explore all possible options to keep the factory open. It is deeply disappointing that Arla has chosen to continue with their move to Lockerbie before they have fully explored the options North Yorkshire stakeholders have put forward.\"\nImage credit: Google Maps Street View, Arla Foods Settle site, September 2022.",

Julian has emphasised his readiness to assist in any initiative that will protect jobs and support the affected employees.\nCommenting, Julian stated, \"I am deeply disappointed by the proposed closure of the Arla site in Settle. My priority is to ensure that we explore all possible avenues to protect jobs affected by this decision.
