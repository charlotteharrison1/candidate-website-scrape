This is the latest news in the long-running saga which began back in the 1970’s! It has already cost taxpayers several millions and there is nothing to show for it, except a state-of-the-art Council HQ! For this latest proposal WDDC has already agreed to spend up to £520,000 on consultants.\nThe plans for Charles Street are a bit more modest than previous attempts and are based solely on a new food store – it could be Waitrose, but a number of other stores have also expressed an interest.\nThe plans for Lower Fairfield are more ambitious as they feature a large new M&S together with a number of smaller shops.\nIf both sites were to be developed there would be a loss of over 700 car parking spaces! As the town already suffers from a lot of parking in residential streets this would force WDDC to build two new multi-storey car parks – one on Charles Street and one on Middle Fairfield. The latter in particular would be very visible as people drive into the town from the Weymouth direction.\nAll the possible sites for these new shops and new multi-storeys are on land that is rich in archaeology and so will be expensive to develop. This is what caused the last development proposals to collapse.\nIn addition, if Fairfield is developed what will happen to the Market? WDDC talk about finding another location in the town centre but is there a feasible site and who would pay for the new buildings that would be required?\nFinally, what would happen to South Street if M&S and a few other key shops were to move to Lower Fairfield?\nTo have you say please complete a short six question survey at http://www.west-dorset-libdems.org.uk/dorchester_town_centre_survey\n1 Comment\nHello, Mr. Canning.\nI am just one of Molly’s leaflet distribution volunteers, but a resident of Dorchester just the same. It appears from the recent ‘Focus’ that W.D.D.C have sort of caught up with my thinking regarding the Charles Street patch, if about five years later.\nIn October 2012 I gave Alistair Chisholm a model of a way to get the best out of the remaining space on the Charles Street site, and I believe that he may still have it. Can I suggest that you ask him about it, since the ideas it contains would provide a far better solution than another farcical debate about an unwanted “development” of shops.\nThere was a brief text outline of the proposal at the time, which I still have on file, if you would be interested in seeing it. Better still, read it with the model before you, since I believe that what is offered is far superior to the proposal from W.D.D.C., who have rather unsubtly got themselves another would- be developer in mind. Yours sincerely, Harry Marshall, 21, Vespasian Way, Dorchester,",

It seems amazing that it’s taken so long. However, at last I feel we might be getting there. Waitrose and M&S have both signed up for stores at least twice as large as their current premises. Unfortunately there’s still a funding gap of about £4 million but this week WDDC agreed to underwrite half of this and developer Simons will have to find the other half. With the economy improving this might never be needed but even if it is the Council should get the money back fairly quickly through higher car parking revenue from more shoppers and higher business rates. In contrast to the £16 million wasted on new Council Offices for no return to the public I feel that a £2 million investment to boost the town’s shopping is worth it.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

The NHS is under huge pressure from cuts at a time when the numbers of elderly people needing its services is increasing.Locally, there are proposals to close GP Surgeries, transfer services away from Dorset County Hospital to Poole and Bournemouth and reduce the number of beds in community hospitals.At the same time local bus services are set to de decimated after July 22nd leaving many people isolated if they don’t have a car.

It’s been a very frustrating time for EE users. Many people have contacted me about the poor or non-existent signal that they have been getting. This Monday I got in touch with the CEO of EE. To give them credit they responded quickly and launched an investigation. It turns out that at the time of the merger they had done some computer modelling that showed that Dorchester could cope with one less phone mast. Clearly the modelling was wrong and they now admit this was the case. So from today the old mast has been switched back on and full service has been resumed!\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

There is a real concern about powerful and noxious smells being blown over Crossways. “I have been contacted by many residents who are deeply concerned about how close this proposed huge slurry lagoon is to the village and I call on West Dorset District Council to listen to local people and throw it out!” says Cllr Andy Canning.\n1 Comment\nDear Sir,\nAs a concerned resident of Crossways, I can’t believe all the opposition to these plans. The farmer is neither requesting permission to start keeping cows, nor asking permission for them to start pooing, rather is asking to IMPROVE his current slurry storage facilities in line with European laws.\nFACT: the proposed slurry lagoon would be further away from the village with respect to the current slurry storage facilities\nFACT: there would be less odour than now\nFACT: there would be less potential damage to the environment (far less risk of leakage)\nFACT: the plans have passed thorough inspection by the environmental agency\nFACT: The farmer doesn’t even want to build the lagoon as he firstly doesn’t own the land and secondly there are plans to build residential homes on that land in the near future anyway. His hand is being forced to build a lagoon by the powers that be.\nFACT: The size of the lagoon was as requested by the people who know what is needed to fulfil obligations (think logically: the farmer would want to minimise costs).\nI went to the Crossways PCC meeting in November with an open mind, and was appalled at the way the poor farmer was treated, not a word of his explanations listened to, and all the accusations not based on fact. One example: the “poisonous gases” that were reported as to being of concern, were NOT from the sort of slurry lagoon being proposed here. They were from underground, covered pits, that are not even used in this country (the report produced at the meeting was from Ireland). He was also told the smells were particularly bad in summer, but his reply that slurry is only collected in winter was completely ignored – another false allegation brushed aside. They were simply farm smells – which people could move to a town if they want to avoid.\nThose were only two of many examples in which the farmer was not listened to at all. I was appalled at the way he was treated, and almost expected him to be burned at the stake next. That same evening I then went on to the Dorset planning permission website and was amazed at how many farms had successfully and easily applied for permission to build lagoons in line with EU and environmental legislation. It seems to me like Crossways is trying to urbanise itself – or at best stirring up a campaign for the sake of having a voice heard, whether it be one based on fact or not.\nSo my status as “concerned” resident is that of seeing a farm, which has been on that site for over 100 years (ie way before the rest of the village even existed), being bullied into having to shut down to make way for townies invading us. I choose to live in the country, and part of that is to smell the farm smells. Those “fumes” are not at all poisonous. My grandfather always used to tell me “As long as you smell that, you know you’re not dead”!!\nBest regards,\nHannah",

North Square/Colliton Street/Friary Lane etc. Should broadly be left as they are now but with possible improvements to include a 20mph speed limit and ‘access only’ signs\n2. Princes Street should not be used as a bus route\n3. Great Western Road should be made one-way in phase 1. This would deal with the problems of increased traffic volume and air pollution and allow for all the residents parking to be kept\n4. The Junction should be made easier to navigate and more pedestrian friendly. This would help make 3 above work and stop the perception of Brewery Square becoming cut off by closing access to/from Prince of Wales Road and look at moving the pedestrian crossing closer to the bottom of South Street\n5. Top O’ Town needs to be made safer for pedestrians and\n6. Cornwall Road/Borough Gardens/Victoria Road needs to see traffic pushed out to Williams Avenue. In addition County needs to look at the problems of rat running being experienced in the one-way part of Cornwall Road and see if anything works (reversing the traffic flow?).\nThese are the conditions that have to be met if I am going to support DTEP.\nSo how do we move forward from here?\nA guiding principle is that County needs to be open and transparent and seen to be working with the local community. For me that means after the consultation is finished there will need to be significant modifications, then the traffic and air pollution models will need to be run again and finally there will have to be a further stage of public consultation.\nIt is far better to spend a bit of time getting this right rather than rushing ahead with a flawed Plan.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

Both motions have been fully accepted with unanimous support.\nThe rate of Hate Crimes recorded nationally rose by 42% in the week after the EU Referendum.\nThat’s a total of over 200 reported incidents every day.\nSome very unpleasant passions were let out of control by the anti-immigrant rhetoric aired by a handful of politicians and newspapers during the EU Referendum. It’s not just effecting people in London or Bristol. I have been told of a rise in incidents of bullying and abuse towards children from East European backgrounds at some of our secondary schools.\nI believe this rise in racism and hate crime needs to be tackled and the racists shown that their views are not held by the vast majority of local people. As a result I put forward motions to both Dorset County Council and West Dorset District Council that completely condemn this behaviour and seek to reassure everyone living here that they are valued members of our community regardless of where they were born. Both motions were accepted unanimously.\nLeave a Reply",

Independent scientific evidence from previous culls indicates that bovine TB was only reduced by 23% after a cull and that in neighbouring areas the incidence of TB actually increased by 29% as infected badgers moved out of the culling area! Also when the scientists re-examined the area of culling a few years later the incidence of TB had only declined by 12-16%. So not only are a large number of badgers being killed but even under well managed circumstances the incidence of bovine TB only declined marginally!\n2 Comments\nThank you for standing up for Badgers.\nDear Andy\nI’m sure you know that Dorset for Badger and Bovine Welfare are campaigning against this cull. The culls in Somerset and Glocs were supposed to be trialling the effectiveness, humaneness and safety aspects of shooting free running badgers. They have met none of these criteria.Our group have first hand experience of patrolling in the Somerset cull zone. The area is like a war zone at night, the police are everywhere blocking roads and searching cars. There are vehicles speeding around the country lanes all through the night. Patrollers are being intimidated and harassed, there have been several incidents of assault and a dog has been knifed. Patrollers are often in close proximity to shooting. Martin Surl the PCC in Glocs is strongly against the cull because of its detrimental effect on community cohesion. The cost to the public of each badger is now estimated at £3,000. This would be a disaster if it was rolled out to Dorset.\nWe have now set up the Dorset Badger Vaccination Project and will shortly have a press release. We will be fund raising and offering vaccination to landowners for a small fee. Is it possible that Dorset CC will look at this issue again with a view to vaccination instead of culling?",

It is my understanding GPs and their Practices are small businesses in their own right, not controlled by or answerable to the NHS.\nAside from this, it is also my understanding the GPs in Dorset form the membership of the Dorset Clinical Commissioning Group. Surely it is the GPs we should be addressing directly over any proposals and not their administrative workforce?\nI hope to receive your clarification on these questions soon.",

The site needs to be developed sympathetically to incorporate its heritage, to provide much needed affordable housing and to open up the gardens with their fantastic views over the countryside. It’s now more than six months since the Prison closed and I am disappointed that West Dorset District Council has not taken a stronger lead in protecting this important site.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

There is a real concern about powerful and noxious smells being blown over Crossways. “I have been contacted by many residents who are deeply concerned about how close this proposed huge slurry lagoon is to the village and I call on West Dorset District Council to listen to local people and throw it out!” says Cllr Andy Canning.\n1 Comment\nDear Sir,\nAs a concerned resident of Crossways, I can’t believe all the opposition to these plans. The farmer is neither requesting permission to start keeping cows, nor asking permission for them to start pooing, rather is asking to IMPROVE his current slurry storage facilities in line with European laws.\nFACT: the proposed slurry lagoon would be further away from the village with respect to the current slurry storage facilities\nFACT: there would be less odour than now\nFACT: there would be less potential damage to the environment (far less risk of leakage)\nFACT: the plans have passed thorough inspection by the environmental agency\nFACT: The farmer doesn’t even want to build the lagoon as he firstly doesn’t own the land and secondly there are plans to build residential homes on that land in the near future anyway. His hand is being forced to build a lagoon by the powers that be.\nFACT: The size of the lagoon was as requested by the people who know what is needed to fulfil obligations (think logically: the farmer would want to minimise costs).\nI went to the Crossways PCC meeting in November with an open mind, and was appalled at the way the poor farmer was treated, not a word of his explanations listened to, and all the accusations not based on fact. One example: the “poisonous gases” that were reported as to being of concern, were NOT from the sort of slurry lagoon being proposed here. They were from underground, covered pits, that are not even used in this country (the report produced at the meeting was from Ireland). He was also told the smells were particularly bad in summer, but his reply that slurry is only collected in winter was completely ignored – another false allegation brushed aside. They were simply farm smells – which people could move to a town if they want to avoid.\nThose were only two of many examples in which the farmer was not listened to at all. I was appalled at the way he was treated, and almost expected him to be burned at the stake next. That same evening I then went on to the Dorset planning permission website and was amazed at how many farms had successfully and easily applied for permission to build lagoons in line with EU and environmental legislation. It seems to me like Crossways is trying to urbanise itself – or at best stirring up a campaign for the sake of having a voice heard, whether it be one based on fact or not.\nSo my status as “concerned” resident is that of seeing a farm, which has been on that site for over 100 years (ie way before the rest of the village even existed), being bullied into having to shut down to make way for townies invading us. I choose to live in the country, and part of that is to smell the farm smells. Those “fumes” are not at all poisonous. My grandfather always used to tell me “As long as you smell that, you know you’re not dead”!!\nBest regards,\nHannah",

All other supported services would come to an end.\nSince then the following six services have been saved in some form – the 1, 2 and 6 Dorchester town services, the 40 from Bridport-Yeovil, the 71 Lyme Regis town service and the 101 which has been replaced by the new 5 service.\nThat still leaves the following services coming to an end this weekend.\n44 Bridport – West Bay\n73 Bridport – Powerstock\n74 Sherborne – Yetminster – Yeovil\n210 Bridport – Litton Cheney\n211 Poundbury – Weymouth\n212 Dorchester – Yeovil\n307 Dorchester – Sturminster Newton\n311 Dorchester – Blandford\n368 Blandford – Sherborne – Yeovil\nThese cuts will leave hundreds of people facing rural isolation. Many people who don’t have access to a car will be unable to get to the shops or attend medical appointments. At best they will become reliant on volunteers to drive them or pay a hefty charge to a taxi company.\nAnd the advice that some Conservative Councillors have been giving people? “Sell your house and move to a town!” This shows their complete lack of understanding or empathy.\nClearly it isn’t just Theresa May who is out of touch with the British people.

That’s the question I asked in a debate at County Hall today on whether the Council should write to the Government to oppose any badger cull in Dorset. The other question that I felt needed answering is whether the cull would work? Independent scientific evidence from previous culls indicates that bovine TB was only reduced by 23% after a cull and that in neighbouring areas the incidence of TB actually increased by 29% as infected badgers moved out of the culling area! Also when the scientists re-examined the area of culling a few years later the incidence of TB had only declined by 12-16%. So not only are a large number of badgers being killed but even under well managed circumstances the incidence of bovine TB only declined marginally!\n2 Comments\nThank you for standing up for Badgers.\nDear Andy\nI’m sure you know that Dorset for Badger and Bovine Welfare are campaigning against this cull. The culls in Somerset and Glocs were supposed to be trialling the effectiveness, humaneness and safety aspects of shooting free running badgers. They have met none of these criteria.Our group have first hand experience of patrolling in the Somerset cull zone. The area is like a war zone at night, the police are everywhere blocking roads and searching cars. There are vehicles speeding around the country lanes all through the night. Patrollers are being intimidated and harassed, there have been several incidents of assault and a dog has been knifed. Patrollers are often in close proximity to shooting. Martin Surl the PCC in Glocs is strongly against the cull because of its detrimental effect on community cohesion. The cost to the public of each badger is now estimated at £3,000. This would be a disaster if it was rolled out to Dorset.\nWe have now set up the Dorset Badger Vaccination Project and will shortly have a press release. We will be fund raising and offering vaccination to landowners for a small fee. Is it possible that Dorset CC will look at this issue again with a view to vaccination instead of culling?",

This is the latest news in the long-running saga which began back in the 1970’s! It has already cost taxpayers several millions and there is nothing to show for it, except a state-of-the-art Council HQ! For this latest proposal WDDC has already agreed to spend up to £520,000 on consultants.\nThe plans for Charles Street are a bit more modest than previous attempts and are based solely on a new food store – it could be Waitrose, but a number of other stores have also expressed an interest.\nThe plans for Lower Fairfield are more ambitious as they feature a large new M&S together with a number of smaller shops.\nIf both sites were to be developed there would be a loss of over 700 car parking spaces! As the town already suffers from a lot of parking in residential streets this would force WDDC to build two new multi-storey car parks – one on Charles Street and one on Middle Fairfield. The latter in particular would be very visible as people drive into the town from the Weymouth direction.\nAll the possible sites for these new shops and new multi-storeys are on land that is rich in archaeology and so will be expensive to develop. This is what caused the last development proposals to collapse.\nIn addition, if Fairfield is developed what will happen to the Market? WDDC talk about finding another location in the town centre but is there a feasible site and who would pay for the new buildings that would be required?\nFinally, what would happen to South Street if M&S and a few other key shops were to move to Lower Fairfield?\nTo have you say please complete a short six question survey at http://www.west-dorset-libdems.org.uk/dorchester_town_centre_survey\n1 Comment\nHello, Mr. Canning.\nI am just one of Molly’s leaflet distribution volunteers, but a resident of Dorchester just the same. It appears from the recent ‘Focus’ that W.D.D.C have sort of caught up with my thinking regarding the Charles Street patch, if about five years later.\nIn October 2012 I gave Alistair Chisholm a model of a way to get the best out of the remaining space on the Charles Street site, and I believe that he may still have it. Can I suggest that you ask him about it, since the ideas it contains would provide a far better solution than another farcical debate about an unwanted “development” of shops.\nThere was a brief text outline of the proposal at the time, which I still have on file, if you would be interested in seeing it. Better still, read it with the model before you, since I believe that what is offered is far superior to the proposal from W.D.D.C., who have rather unsubtly got themselves another would- be developer in mind.

North Square/Colliton Street/Friary Lane etc. Should broadly be left as they are now but with possible improvements to include a 20mph speed limit and ‘access only’ signs\n2. Princes Street should not be used as a bus route\n3. Great Western Road should be made one-way in phase 1. This would deal with the problems of increased traffic volume and air pollution and allow for all the residents parking to be kept\n4. The Junction should be made easier to navigate and more pedestrian friendly. This would help make 3 above work and stop the perception of Brewery Square becoming cut off by closing access to/from Prince of Wales Road and look at moving the pedestrian crossing closer to the bottom of South Street\n5. Top O’ Town needs to be made safer for pedestrians and\n6. Cornwall Road/Borough Gardens/Victoria Road needs to see traffic pushed out to Williams Avenue. In addition County needs to look at the problems of rat running being experienced in the one-way part of Cornwall Road and see if anything works (reversing the traffic flow?).\nThese are the conditions that have to be met if I am going to support DTEP.\nSo how do we move forward from here?\nA guiding principle is that County needs to be open and transparent and seen to be working with the local community. For me that means after the consultation is finished there will need to be significant modifications, then the traffic and air pollution models will need to be run again and finally there will have to be a further stage of public consultation.\nIt is far better to spend a bit of time getting this right rather than rushing ahead with a flawed Plan.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

In contrast to the £16 million wasted on new Council Offices for no return to the public I feel that a £2 million investment to boost the town’s shopping is worth it.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

WDDC have promised to consult with local residents about the final design of any new housing to minimise its impact, whilst maximising community facilities. I will make sure that they listen.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

We have campaigned hard to get a target set in the new Local Plan that 35% of all new housing should be affordable.\nIt is therefore deeply disappointing that the developers of the Old Prison have not included any affordable housing in their planning application for this significant site. This is just not acceptable and as a result we are pressing WDDC to reject the current planning application.\nWDDC needs to stand firm on this as it is the first large development to be put forward since the Local Plan was adopted and any watering down of the commitment to affordable housing would be most unwelcome and set a bad precedent for future sites.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

The current guidelines were created back in 2010 and make it quite difficult to get a 20mph speed limit introduced. Since then the national rules have changed and the government is on record as saying they want to see an increase in 20mph zones both in urban areas and in villages. I have long been of the opinion that there should be 20mph limits by schools, play areas and where residents see a clear need for them. I pushed very hard to get this review and will keep on working to get the County to be as supportive as possible of the wishes of local residents. At the moment I know local Parish Councils are pressing for 20mph speed limits to be introduced in Broadmayne, West Stafford and Tolpuddle. Please contact me if you know of an area that would benefit from a lower speed limit.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

The deadline for comments has been extended until December 20th as this issue is raising so many concerns.\nIn particular I am worried about whether Princes Street can really cope with becoming the main bus route, the amount of extra traffic being directed down South Walks into Great Western Road and Cornwall Road, the effects this will have on The Junction and the lack of any plans to make Top O’Town safer.\n1 Comment\nThe recently revised version of the DTEP is at best little different from the 1st one, from which it could be said that we were saved by the otherwise infamous credit crunch e.g.\nIf it’s supposed to stop/help stop traffic pollution, all it’ll do is to \\spread it about a bit\\ at huge public cost!\n& also e.g.\nIt’ll increase traffic in the increasingly important area between Brewery Sq & the original Town Centre, as well\nsome Residential streets, & could well also have an impact on the future of the only recently surplus Prison site\nBut whilst we also currently see further reductions in the already inadequate & hugely expensive public transport:\nwhere’s the creative thinking regarding traffic &/or pollution problems",

It will leave Martinstown at 09.25 to go to Weymouth and leave there to return at 14.15 – giving you about four hours. Then at 14.48 it will leave Martinstown to go to Poundbury where passengers could either shop locally or go into the town centre on the 6 or X31. You could then spend a couple of hours shopping or visiting the doctors before returning on the X31 at 17.26. I know this isn’t ideal but without First Buses changing their minds over the X31 it’s about the best we can hope for.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply"
