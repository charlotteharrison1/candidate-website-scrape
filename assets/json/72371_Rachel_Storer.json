I'm delighted that 302 pharmacies in our local NHS area have signed up to the Government’s new Pharmacy First approach.\nThis will mean that pharmacists can treat more conditions without patients needing to see a GP or have a prescription first, helping people receive treatment sooner and freeing up vital GP appointments in our local surgeries.\nWe are sticking with the plan to cut NHS waiting lists, deliver more care in the community, and speed up access to care for those who need it.",

Despite the difficulties, this upbringing instilled in Rachel resilience, empathy, and a passion for improvement—qualities she brought to her political, personal and professional life.\nBelieving in personal responsibility as the bedrock of a stable, free society, Rachel will use her sense of justice and genuine desire to make a positive impact, to speak up for residents and inform policy decisions. Rachel stands out as a reliable advocate for our area.\nCareer\nRachel career spans business, public service and passion for working on behalf of others.\nRachel had a successful career in the health and fitness industry, building a business with a strong commitment to helping people improve their health. Running a business and being an employer has given Rachel a real life understanding of the challenges faced by local businesses.\nAlongside her career, Rachel raised a family and studied social sciences and economics before entering public service to make a difference to her local community. Rachel has gained experience in both local and national politics and a track record campaigning on the issues that matter most to local people.\nCommunity and Charity Work\nEngaged in voluntary work, Rachel volunteers at a charity offering out of hours support to adults with poor mental health. Rachel is also an Conservative Policy Forum Ambassador, contributing and leading in national policy debates and as a Board Member of a Birchwood Big Local she actively support community projects.\nFamily and leisure\nRachel is married with 5 grown up children and two grandchildren. Passionate about music and small live music venues, Rachel can often be found at gigs and open mic nights. She enjoys reading and spending time with her family and their adopted Greyhound, Claude.",

This new manifesto commitment will mean a new police officer for every ward in England and Wales.\n- People expect to see police officers on the streets where they live. The Conservatives’ 8,000 extra officers will be focused solely on policing their local beat, cutting crime and helping people feel safer in their area.\nRachel Storer has welcomed the Conservatives’ clear plan to recruit 8,000 additional full-time police with the full power of arrest, ensuring people across Hull West & Haltemprice feel safer in their area.\nUnder the Conservatives, there are now 20,000 more police since 2019 and overall crime has fallen by 54 per cent since 2010. This announcement will build on this success, recruiting 8,000 more full-time neighbourhood police officers with the full power of arrest – equivalent to an additional police officer for every ward in England and Wales.\nThese officers will be specifically focused on policing the local neighbourhood they are assigned to, boosting the visible police presence in communities and helping families feel safer in their area. These strengthened neighbourhood policing teams will ensure every neighbourhood will have a genuine and more continuous police officer coverage.\nThere will also be a new requirement for police forces not to offset these additional officers by diverting police officers already dedicated to neighbourhood duties, to other purposes, ensuring neighbourhood policing is prioritised. The Conservatives will also roll out the Hotspot Policing Programme nationally following its successful pilot.\nIn contrast to the Conservatives’ plan to recruit 8,000 full-time neighbourhood police with the full power of arrest, Labour would recruit just 3,000 of these equivalent officers under their pledge, leaving neighbourhood policing teams without the resources they need to keep families in Hull West & Haltemprice safe.\nCommenting, Rachel Storer said:\n“Our police work incredibly hard to support our communities across Hull West & Haltemprice, but we know our police need more resources to keep local residents safe.\n“That is why I welcome the announcement today that the Conservatives will recruit 8,000 more full-time police officers with the full power of arrest, over the double the number Labour have pledged.\n“The choice is clear in this election. Stick with the plan with Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives who will recruit more police and keep our area safe, or go back to square one with Keir Starmer and the Labour Party who have consistently opposed tougher measures to crack down on crime.”\nCommenting, Rishi Sunak, the Prime Minister said:\n“Our 20,000 new police officers since 2019 have made a huge difference, with neighbourhood crime down 48 per cent as a result. We will now go further by hiring 8,000 more police officers, each one dedicated to their local community.\n“People deserve to feel safe in their neighbourhood. More bobbies on the beat and increased powers will give police forces the tools they need to drive down neighbourhood crime even further.\n“On the other hand, Labour has no plan and no idea how to fund more police officers. Without a plan crime will only go up, as we’ve seen in those living in areas with a Labour Police and Crime Commissioner. Our clear plan will create a more secure future for neighbourhoods up and down the country.”\nJames Cleverly, the Home Secretary said:\n“The Conservatives will always back our brave police and security services with the powers and resources needed to keep our country safe.\n“The new neighbourhood police programme we have announced today will make our streets safer.\n“The Conservatives will take bold action with a clear plan to build a more secure future for people up and down the country. Unlike Keir Starmer’s Labour Party who have no plan to keep the country safe. You only have to look to London where crime has risen under Labour rule to see the real damage the Labour Party can do to your community.”\nENDS",

Or go back to square one with Labour who cannot say how they would reduce costs for working families because they do not have a plan.”\nCommenting, Chancellor of the Exchequer, Jeremy Hunt MP said:\n“Because we stuck to the plan, the economy has turned a corner – inflation has fallen from 11.1 per cent to 3.4 per cent, wages are rising, mortgage rates are starting to come down and debt is on track to fall as a share of the economy.\n“That is why this April we are cutting the double tax on work, putting £900 back in the pockets of the average worker, freezing business rates, boosting pensions, cutting the cost of childcare and delivering a record increase to the National Living Wage.\n“By sticking to the plan, the Conservatives will deliver a stronger economy to build a brighter future. Labour cannot say what they would do with the economy because they do not have a plan – they would take us back to square one.”\nENDS",

With the rollout beginning on 1 April 2024, eligible working parents of two-year-olds can now access 15 hours of free childcare perweek.\n- Only the Conservatives have a plan to deliver a brighter future for parents and their families – whether that be in the workplace contributing to our economy or staying at home to raise the next generation.\nRachel Storer, Conservative Parliamentary candidate has welcomed the roll-out of the largest ever expansion of childcare in England’s history with eligible working parents of two-year-olds now able to access 15 hours of free childcare per week.\nCurrently, working families in England with children aged three to four-years-old are eligible for 30 hours of free childcare for 38 weeks of the year – a total of 1,140 hours per year.\nHowever, the Conservative Government is committed to securing a better deal for hard-working families across the country, so parents feel empowered to make the choice that is best for them and their family – whether that be returning to work or staying at home to raise their children.\nThat is why from 1 April, the Conservative Government has extended the childcare package so that eligible working parents of two-year-olds can now access 15 hours of childcare support per week.\nBut this is just phase one. From September 2024, working parents with children from the age of nine months until they start school will be able to benefit from 15 hours of free childcare per week. This will be expanded again in September 2025 with working parents of children under the age of five able to benefit from 30 hours free childcare per week.\nIn addition to delivering the largest expansion of childcare in England’s history, 96 per cent of early education providers are now rated good or outstanding under the Conservatives – up from just 68 per cent in 2010, giving parents a massive confidence boost in the standards of this provision.\nUnder Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives, the plan is working. If we stick to the plan, we can continue to deliver on our promise of providing parents with the choice to either stay at home to raise the next generation or return to work to contribute to our economy, empowering them to secure the brighter future for themselves and their families.\nCommenting, Rachel said:\n“Too many families in our area are held back from returning to work once they have had children because the cost of childcare is too high.\n“But the Conservative Government is putting an end to this, and eligible parents of two-year-olds are now able to access 15 hours of government-funded childcare a week, with the expansion to go further this year and next, empowering parents to return to work whilst raising a family.\n“Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives have a plan and it is working – and we must stick to that plan to continue supporting parents in their careers, whilst also ensuring a brighter future for the next generation.”\nCommenting, Secretary of State for Education Gillian Keegan, said:\n“This government is taking long term decisions to give working families a brighter future, which is why we are making the largest ever investment in childcare in England’s history.\n“From April, well over one hundred thousand more parents will be benefitting from our expanded offer – and next year, hard-working parents with children from nine months old up to when they start school will get a full 30 hours – saving parents £6,900 a year.\n“This progress would be destroyed by Labour who have no plan and would take us back to square one by refusing to commit to 30 hours of free childcare, risking the futures of thousands of young people across the country.”\nENDS",
