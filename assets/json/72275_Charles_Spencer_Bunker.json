In agreeing to sell the common to the community this beautiful and biodiverse open space will be secured in perpetuity for us all to enjoy.\nFriends of Kinsbourne Green Common will be structured so that all local residents can be members and have a say in how it is cared for. With the purchase agreed, and a number of pledges already in place, funds must now urgently be raised by the end of November 2023 in order to complete the sale. The aim is to maintain the land in its current state and going forward, work to further improve the rich biodiversity and ensure it is accessible to all.\nContact them by email:\nVisit their website: www.kinsbournegreencommon.org.uk",

Only factual information will be provided by Harpenden and Berkhamsted Reform; where possible, with links to verify it.\nWhat are Stealth Taxes?\nThirty years ago, governments were more honest – when changes were made to taxation, they raised or lowered the headline rates of tax. This made it clear that the government was increasing or reducing taxes. Now governments resort to stealth taxes – taxing you more, while hoping you won’t notice. One way of doing this is leaving the tax thresholds untouched, instead of increasing them in line with inflation. The example below shows how it works.\nCurrent UK Tax Rates for an Employee\nIn the current tax year:\nIncome tax is 20% on all earnings over the personal allowance of £12,570.\nFor national insurance, nothing is paid for the first £12,584, 8% up to £50,284, and then a further 2% on all income above that.\nCurrent Tax and National Insurance Paid\nFor someone earning £30,000 a year:\nIncome tax of 20% is payable on £17,430 – this is £3,486.\nNational insurance of 8% is payable on £17,416 – this is £1,393.\nOf the £30,000, the government has taken £4,879. This is just over 16% of the employee’s wages – about one pound in every six.\nStealth Taxes in Action\nAssume this employee gets an annual 5% pay rise – this takes their pay up to £31,500. However, the government leaves the personal allowances and tax rates untouched in the budget despite inflation – a stealth tax.\nIncome tax of 20% is payable on £18,930 – this is £3,786\nNational insurance of 8% is payable on £18,816 – this is £1,513.\nOf the £31,500, the government has taken £5,299. This is close to 17% of the employee’s wages\nJust by leaving the tax thresholds and headline tax rate untouched, the government has taken another 1% of the employee’s wages; 17%, rather than 16%.\nThe Honest Way of Increasing Taxation\nThe honest way of increasing the tax take would have been to put up the thresholds on which tax was paid and simultaneously increase the headline tax rate. This might have been (assuming) 3% inflation:\nIncome tax is 21% on all earnings over the increased personal allowance of £12,950.\nFor national insurance, nothing is paid for the first £12,961, 8% up to £51,793, and then a further 2% on all income above that.\nBut governments no longer have the courage to change the headline rate of tax – this is too noticeable. Instead, they increase taxes by stealth.\nBoth Tory and Labour governments are like pickpockets taking money out of your pocket without you noticing.\nReferences\nUK Income Tax Rates\nhttps://www.gov.uk/income-tax-rates\nUK National Insurance Rates\nhttps://www.gov.uk/national-insurance-rates-letters",

In his letter, Mr Afolami said that the Town Council would make an “excellent custodian” of the Common, protecting it as an important amenity space for Harpenden over the longer term and ensuring that there is no future risk of developers attempting to build on the site.\nBim Afolami MP said,\n“Residents have shared their concerns with me over the future of Kinsbourne Green Common – and I share those concerns. This is a crucial green space for people in Harpenden and Kinsbourne Green and it is important that it should be owned and managed for the benefit of local residents.\n“Harpenden Town Council is already a significant local landowner, managing Harpenden Common, Rothamsted Park and a number of smaller greens and open spaces in Harpenden.

Disillusioned by the empty promises and lack of accountability from mainstream politicians, he has taken on the role of Reform UK Branch Chair for Hertsmere with a fierce determination to challenge the status quo.\nDarren's journey into politics was catalyzed by the aftermath of the 2016 Brexit referendum, where he witnessed the disregard for the democratic process first hand. This spurred him to join the Brexit Party and eventually become the Prospective Parliamentary Candidate for Epping Forest. Since then, his passion for reform and accountability has only grown stronger.\nHis platform is bold and unapologetic. Darren advocates for a smaller state where individuals have more control over their lives. He is opposed to the Net Zero agenda, viewing it as economically damaging and environmentally ineffective. Darren is committed to reducing taxes, fostering economic growth, and implementing sensible immigration policies. Furthermore, he aims to overhaul public services, including the NHS, to ensure they are efficient and accessible to all.\nhttps://www.facebook.com/DarrenSelkus2020\nHe proposes the creation of a new Department for Efficiency and Accountability (DEA) and is eager to play a key role in its establishment. The DEA would tackle waste, inefficiency, and bureaucracy in the public sector, ensuring taxpayer money is spent effectively to fix our failing public services and provide the quality services the British people deserve.\nFor Darren, politics is not about personal gain; it's about making a tangible difference in the lives of ordinary people. In the General Election on the 4th July he stood in Hertsmere as the Reform UK Parliamentary Candidate against Sir Oliver Dowden MP increasing his vote share by seven times from the Council Election just a year previous.\nIn a political landscape marred by apathy and disillusionment, Darren Selkus stands out as a beacon of hope for those yearning for real change. With his unwavering dedication, military discipline, and business acumen, he is poised to challenge the entrenched interests and truly represent the voices of Hertsmere. As he aptly puts it, \"If you want change, you have to change your vote.\" And Darren Selkus is here to lead that change.\nChair Reform UK Hertsmere\nTelephone: 07513 839952",

Higher growth rates are the only way to better wages and more tax revenues that can be invested in better healthcare and other public services. Our bold economic vision frees up over 6 million people from paying Income Tax and frees up over 1.2 million small businesses and self-employed from paying Corporation Tax. We would also aim to remove a raft of other stifling taxes in a responsible, timely way. This will generate much faster growth than seen in recent decades. We must also stop wasting taxpayers’ money.\nThe Government has increased taxes to the highest level in 70 years with more taxes to come. Medium-term growth is expected to be the lowest for 60 years. This means lower wages and less money to invest in health and other public services. Inflation is at the highest level for over 30 years and productivity is at the lowest for 20 years, with 1 in 8 people of working age on out of work benefits, totalling well over 5 million.\nThe combined works of Harry Potter are fun but dwarfed by our tax code of some 20,000 pages, the most complex in the world. This stifles growth and creates an industry of unproductive tax avoidance.\nSmart money and smart people will not invest in the UK nor come to the UK in a mobile world if they think we are uncompetitive in tax terms.\nReform UK is the only party that stands for cutting taxes and simplifying taxes to create higher growth, better wages and better healthcare.\nReform UK will also oppose the creation of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) and all attempts to turn Britain into a cashless society.\nStimulus Plan\n- Free up 6 million people from paying Income Tax by lifting the minimum threshold to £20,000 from £12,571 p.a. This amounts to 1 in 5 taxpayers. Basic Income Tax rate stays at 20%.\n- The less well-off benefit proportionately the most, saving £1,500 p.a. @£20,000 salary, circa £30 per week.\n- Free up 1.2 million SMEs from paying Corporation Tax (over 80% of companies) by lifting the minimum profit threshold to £100,000.\n- Reduce the cost of living by lowering consumer taxes, which will reduce inflation whilst stimulating growth:\n- scrap vat on energy bills, saves £100's / year per household\n- Scrap environmental levies = saves £160 / year per household.\n- Lower fuel duty by 20p / litre = saves £240 / year per driver.\n- Lower VAT from 20% to 18% = saves £300 / year per household.\n- Funded by cost savings totalling approximately £85 billion:\n- Reduce wasteful Government spending: £5 in £100 = £50 billion per year.\n- Enable over 1 million out of the over 5 million on out of work benefits back into jobs: saves circa £15-20 billion per year. Some 1.5 million more people are on benefits than pre-Covid, so a return just to 2019 levels is eminently realistic.\n- Tax the Renewable Energy industry the full amount of the circa £11 billion in subsidies they currently receive under old contracts; they claim it is cheaper than other energy forms, so they no longer need taxpayer support.\n- Remove vast swathes of unnecessary regulations that hinder growth.\nAll figures are approximate and based on estimates.",

Since the misguided politically correct are corrupting the English language in the name of wokery, if you are unhappy with the 'man' bit, I am happy to be called 'Spokey. Visit www.ReformUKWatford.net to find out more about me.\nIn my world, other than spiritual matters, the happiness and vibrancy of the community in which I live are most important to me. This is why politics matters. Watford is a great place to live. Just a few years ago, for example, government data showed that almost 90% of people aged 50 to 64 were in work here. The highest employment rate for that age group in Britain. With the crushing burden of Tory taxes, the disincentive built into the benefits system and the lack of trust in Government and institutions, those numbers today are a pipe dream.\nThe core message of Reform UK in Watford about the current state of UK politics is: 'We Can't Go On Like This'. The UK's two- party system at a national level is broken and has become unworkable. The Tory Party is too broad a church and has become ungovernable. How can one party accommodate the Liberal Democrat politics of Theresa May and the Libertarian policies of Liz Truss? How can another main party accommodate the revolutionary socialist politics of supporters of Jeremy Corbyn and the corporatist politics of Kier Starmer? The behind-locked-doors ructions in the Conservative Government and the Labour Party should be out in the open, as part of transparent coalition talks, with parliamentarians elected under proportional representation.\nWe are over-governed. Key UK institutions need reform. Undemocratic House of Lords, too many Members of Parliament, in Watford too many local councillors and a UK civil service too woke to be operationally effective and not fit for purpose. We need to change things up. On the Watford Borough Council, the Liberal Democrats have a crushing majority and like the two big parties at Westminster, control the future of all of us in closed party meetings. Their arrogance is such that in Park Ward the LibDem councillor claimed allowances of £7,554.96 without attending one full Council Meeting since May 2022. In this local election, Reform UK candidates offer an alternative choice. When elected, none of our candidates will face a party whip. They will always act in the interests of their residents, not their Party's. Reform UK Watford wants to reduce the number of Borough Councillors from THREE per ward to TWO. We want to scrap the elected Mayor position when the Council already has a highly-paid Chief Executive, saving hundreds of thousands of pounds in salary, pension, and office costs over a four-year term.\nWe offer a different way of doing things. Think out of the box on election day and lend your vote to Reform UK Watford.",

That’s why I’m proud to be a member of Reform UK, and prouder still be a spokesman for Harpenden & Berkhamsted, where I grew up.\nThe people of Britain have been betrayed by 25 years of Labour and Conservative rule. That’s 25 years of undermining people’s wages with foreign labour, increasing fuel costs with “green” zealotry, delegating decisions overseas, letting criminals run rampant, letting corruption go unchecked, letting standards fall and never once taking responsibility. Our political class have been robbing us blind and selling off the rest at half-price all while having the audacity to blame you and me for it all!\nNo more. Reform UK is here to take the power back from those who have abused it and frittered it away.\nThings may seem bleak right now, things may get worse, but our history is undeniable, and our character remains, in spite of those who would fit us into a globalist straight jacket.\nThere is so much beauty in this country and, I may be biased when I say this, but Harpenden and Berkhamsted are the most beautiful towns it has to offer. Two twin jewels of Hertfordshire. As spokesman I’ll do everything in my power to make sure their character is preserved. No more building on green belt, no more choking up the streets with traffic, no more suffocating small business in red tape and no more compromising our doctor surgeries and schools with over subscription.\nAs a local man, with a loving wife and a gorgeous baby boy, I’m staying right where I am. Too many people my age (mid-30’s) are running away from this country, they think there’s nothing for us, they think we’re not wanted. My Dad had to run from Iran, when madness and theocracy took over that beautiful country, and I know one thing from his story, it’s that when all is going to hell, Britain is the last place you can go, to be free, to be safe, to say want you want to say and to be who you want to be. I’m going nowhere, I’m staying right here and I’m fighting for a future my son can be proud of.",

We will be working through the Herts Growth Board to assess the economic implications of reorganisation. Collectively we will push the Government to ensure we have an active say in how future changes take shape and to strongly make the case against creating vast, remote council areas with weak links to their communities.\nAs always, our priority remains delivering excellent services to our residents and businesses and putting our communities at the heart of everything we do, and supporting our people to do that as effectively and efficiently as possible.\nThrough all our discussions and future planning, we will remain committed to ensuring that any reorganisation is done in a way that enhances our local democracy and local services in Hertsmere.”",

Being free at the point of delivery is at its core and must always continue.\nThe frontline care is normally amazing, dedicated, and always appreciated. But we have to be honest that in the back office, it is neither the most efficient nor the best managed system in the world.\nLet’s be ambitious: we should aim for zero waiting lists. This is achievable with reform. Many other countries don’t have waiting lists, why should we put up with them? We have been brainwashed that they are the norm; they should not be, and we can achieve zero waiting lists.\nWe must put the patient in charge by having a voucher scheme so they can be seen and treated promptly. Healthcare will always, of course, remain free at the point of delivery.\n- If you cannot be seen by a GP in 3 days, you get a voucher to go private elsewhere.\n- If you cannot be seen by a consultant in 3 weeks, you get a voucher to go private elsewhere.\n- If you cannot have an operation in 9 weeks from Day 1, you get a voucher to go private elsewhere.\nWe must also urgently solve the staffing crisis in health and social care. Our healthcare plan includes zero basic rate income tax for 3 years for all frontline patient facing staff in health and social care. This will significantly help retain and attract back recently departed staff, whilst we train new staff as well. This should mean zero waiting lists in around 24 months as private capacity increases rapidly. Retired medics will come back to work part-time in less bureaucratic healthcare settings.\nOverall efficiency will improve dramatically. Citizens in many countries expect and demand to see a doctor within 1 day. So should we. This is why reform is essential",

Brexit is the opportunity of a lifetime. Yet the challenges we face are vast. Both Labour and Tory governments have broken promise after promise. They have destroyed trust in our democracy and let down the British people.\nOur country is worse off, both financially and culturally. The economy isn’t growing. It is being wrecked by record taxes, wasteful government spending and nanny state regulations. Record mass immigration has damaged our country. The small boats crisis threatens our security. Brexit has been betrayed.\nMulticulturalism has imported separate communities that reject our way of life. ‘Woke’ ideology has captured our public institutions.\nBritain has a housing crisis. Record NHS waiting lists. A benefits crisis. Record crime. Net Zero is making us poorer and colder, damaging British industry and forcing motorists off the road.\nThe Tories have Broken Britain. Labour will bankrupt Britain. A vote for either is a vote for more incompetence, dishonesty and defeat. The two-party system has failed.\nThe United Kingdom therefore faces an urgent existential threat. Whilst people worry about how to define a woman, our leaders have allowed a border to be imposed between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, leaving our Northern Irish kin still tied into the EU.\nThere is an alternative. The British people have a real common sense choice in Reform UK.\nThis is a serious plan to reshape the way our country is organised and run.\nOnly reform will stand up for British culture, identity and values. We will restore trust in our democracy. repair our broken public services. Cut taxes to make work pay. Slash government waste and red tape.\nMaximise Britain’s vast energy treasure of oil and gas, to reduce the cost of energy, beat the cost of living crisis and help unleash real economic growth.\nOnce and for all, we will take back control over our borders, our money and our laws. Reform UK will secure Britain’s future as a free, proud and independent sovereign nation.\nRead this Contract with You to find out how.\nRichard Tice\nLeader, Reform UK\n2: SLASH GOVERNMENT WASTE\nGovernment spending needs major reform.\nGovernment spending has increased by nearly £200 billion per year since 2019. Some 600,000 more people work in the public sector. What is the result? Outcomes are far worse, growth is down and people are receiving a worse service from the public sector, where performance has collapsed. The idea that waste cannot be found, nor efficiencies made, obviously lacks any credibility.\nEveryone has to watch what they spend and make savings. So should the government. After all, they are spending our money, not theirs. We must change course urgently, or Britain will go bust. Reform UK would make sure your hard earned cash is treated with care and respect.\nCritical reforms needed in the first 100 days:\nBank of England Must Stop Paying Interest to Commercial Banks on QE Reserves.\nOther central banks are not doing this. Senior economists and a former Deputy Governor of the Bank of England (BoE) agree. This saves £30-40 billion per year. The BoE must also stop Quantitative Tightening, which is negligently costing the taxpayer billions; stopping this will also help lower interest rates.\nSave £5 in every £100.\nWe make these savings in business and at home. The public sector must be no exception. Every manager across government must find savings without touching frontline services. We should slash wasteful spending, cut bureaucracy and negotiate better value procurement across every department. This will enable lower taxes, more money in your pocket and boost our economy. This saves £50 billion per year.\nScrap Unnecessary Government Quangos and Commissions.\nThere are over 600 government departments, Arm’s Length Bodies or Quangos. Many are unaccountable to parliament. Quango advisors can charge £1,000 per day. Some bosses are paid over £600k per year. Billions of pounds are wasted. The public wouldn’t notice if many dozens were scrapped. These savings are part of the £5 in every £100 mentioned above.\nBrexit Bonus. Cut Unnecessary Regulations.\nGovernment red tape and nanny state regulations are estimated to have cost the UK economy £143 billion since 2015. That means billions of pounds lost in growth and taxes.\nCut Foreign Aid by 50%.\nSave £6 billion from the £12.8 billion budget. British taxpayers should not be funding countries like China or India who have their own space programs. We can do much more good by spending less with better targeting. A major review is needed into the effectiveness of overseas aid.\nSlash Government waste: Potential Savings = £91 billion pa\nThis proposed contract is deliberately issued as a working draft. We welcome your comments, challenges and queries. The contract will be finalised later in the year. This is what happens in business, and the nation should be run like a lean, efficient business with motivated employees and happy customers. Please email comments to:\n3: ECONOMY – PERSONAL\nOur economy needs Reform, to become high growth, with high wages, and lower taxes. We must make work pay.\nSmart tax cuts create growth and pay for themselves. That means more money to invest in reformed public services. It is called the multiplier factor. Instead, the government has hit us with the highest tax burden in 70 years. Record debt, record borrowing and record waste. For too many work no longer pays whilst the cost of living crisis rages.\nBritain produces world class business leaders, innovators, industrialists, scientists and a huge small business sector. We must get the government out of their way. We must trust the British people to build a thriving economy.\nCritical reforms needed in the first 100 days:\nMake Work Pay. Lift the Income Tax Start Point to £20,000 Per Year.\nThis frees up to 7 million people from paying income tax and saves every worker almost £1,500 per year. This will help many back into work and escape the benefits trap. Basic Tax rate stays at 20%. The higher rate should begin at £70,000.\nCut Energy Taxes and Beat the Cost of Living Crisis.\nSave households over £500 per year. Scrap VAT on energy bills. Lower fuel duty by 20p per litre. Scrap environmental levies.\nCut Residential Stamp Duty.\nSubstantially boost economic activity and housebuilding by cutting Stamp Duty to 0% below £750k; 2% from £750k – £1.5m; 4% over £1.5m.\nAbolish the VAT Tourist Tax.\nThe government has cost our economy over £10 billion when they stopped the VAT refund scheme for tourist shopping. This also deterred up to 2 million tourists.\nAbolish the Grief Tax, IHT, for all Estates under £2m.\nThat means some 98% of all estates.\nThe rate above £2m will be 20% tax, with the option to donate to charity instead.\nEconomy – Personal Pledges Costs = £70 billion pa\nThis proposed contract is deliberately issued as a working draft.

Smart tax cuts create growth and pay for themselves year after year. That means more money to invest in reformed public services. The Multiplier Factor.\nBritish businesses are under huge pressure from high rates, high taxes, red tape, energy costs, skills shortages and a government that doesn’t listen. Our high streets are blighted by empty properties. Business talent is moving abroad. Reform UK will back risk takers and wealth creators. We will make sure that Britain is open for business.\nCritical reforms needed in the first 100 days:\nFree Over 1.2 Million Small and Medium Sized Businesses from Corporation Tax.\nLift the minimum profit threshold to £100k. Reduce the main Corporation Tax Rate from 25% to 20%, then to 15% from year 5.\nAbolish IR35 Rules to Support Sole Traders.\nBritain’s self-employed often work longer hours and take more risks. Many have no pension and receive no sick pay.\nLift the VAT Threshold to £120,000.\nFree up small entrepreneurs from red tape.\nThereafter:\nSupport Small and Medium Sized Enterprises.\nSMEs represent over 95% of UK business and two thirds of all employment. Abolish Business Rates for High Street Based Small & Medium Firms. Offset this with Online Delivery Tax at 4% for large, multinational enterprises to create a fairer playing field for high streets. Cut entrepreneur’s tax relief to 5%. SME Enterprise Zones for left-behind Areas with a period of zero tax for new or existing businesses that are creating jobs.\nReform the Planning System.\nFast track new housing on brownfield sites and infrastructure projects to boost businesses, especially in the North and in coastal regeneration areas.\nSlash Business Red Tape. The Brexit Bonus.\nScrap thousands of laws that hold back British business and damage productivity, including employment laws that make it riskier to hire people.\nReform the Tax System.\nMajor simplification is needed. At over 21,000 pages, the UK’s tax code is a burden. Hong Kong’s tax code is under 500 pages.\nEconomy – Business Pledges Costs = £18 billion pa\nThis proposed contract is deliberately issued as a working draft.

That is a city the size of Birmingham. Data is expected to show a similar number arrived in 2023 and probably 2024. New government figures say that almost 14 million people will arrive between 2021 and 2036. That is almost 1 million every year. The population explosion has led directly to the depression of local wages, the housing crisis and the NHS waiting list crisis. British culture, identity and values are under threat.\nIn 2022 over 45,000 illegal immigrants crossed the channel in small boats, followed by some 30,000 in 2023. Most were allowed in with no criminal checks. Over 17,000 have gone missing. Foreign criminals and terrorists walk our streets. Record numbers of asylum claims have been granted, increasing the magnet factor to the UK. Labour and the Tories will never control our borders. The British people have been lied to, ignored and betrayed.\nCritical reforms needed in the first 100 days:\nFreeze Non-Essential Immigration. Smart immigration can target the essential skills our economy needs such as doctors, nurses and successful business people, earning above the average salary.\nStop the Boats with our 6 Point Plan.\nRecognise a national Security Threat. Leave the European Convention on Human Rights: Zero Illegal Immigrants to be Resettled in the UK; Offshore Processing for Illegal Arrivals; New Department of Immigration; Pick up Migrants out of Boats and Take Back to France. (We are legally allowed to do this under international treaties).\nSecure Detention for all Asylum Seekers.\nAsylum claims that arrive though safe countries will be processed rapidly offshore in British Overseas Territories. This will stop the scandal of undocumented asylum seekers absconding to work illegally or commit crime.\nImmediate Deportation for Foreign Criminals.\nDeport foreign nationals immediately after their prison sentence ends. Withdraw citizenship from immigrants who commit significant crime.\nRestrict Student Dependents.\nIntroduce new visa rules for international students and their dependents. Only international students with essential skills can remain in the UK when their study ends. Close down fake courses and abusive immigration schemes.\nStop the Illegal Working Scandal.\nLocal wages have been slashed because of cheap, undocumented, illegal labour that undermines British workers. The pro-immigration establishment has not enforced the rules. Significant penalties will be imposed on companies and directors that breach these rules.\nImmigration Pledges Savings = £5 billion pa\nThis proposed contract is deliberately issued as a working draft.

This can be done, but only with a fresh, bold, can-do approach. Healthcare must remain free at the point of use.\nWhilst we treasure some of the front line care provided by the NHS, we must be honest. The NHS is in crisis: patients are suffering. Too often the care lets people down badly. Waiting lists are at record highs. Hospital beds have been cut from 300,000 to 141,000 while the population has grown by 20%. Hundreds die every week because of delays in Accident and Emergency. Ambulance waiting times are at record highs. This has contributed to an excess deaths crisis and some of the worst health outcomes in Europe.\nThis is not about funding. Per head of population, NHS spending is similar to other western countries. Sadly, the NHS is being let down by incompetent management, bureaucracy, waste, cover-ups and scandals. The NHS has a crisis in leadership. This will take time to fix. It is about structure and motivation.\nCritical reforms needed in the first 100 days:\nTransform Doctor and Nurse Availability.\nAll frontline NHS and social care staff to pay zero basic rate tax for 3 years. This will help retain existing staff and attract back many who have recently left. We want the best staff with patients, not in offices behind desks or retired.\nUse Independent Healthcare Capacity.\nCut waiting lists by using UK & overseas providers. The vast majority do not mind who delivers the cure, we just want the pain gone. This independent sector includes many not for profit health providers that provide some of the best care. Organisations such as Nuffield Health and Marie Curie, which provides end of life cancer care are charities. We want to encourage more of these organisations to end the NHS crisis.\nTax Relief of 20% on all Private Healthcare and Insurance.\nWe will incentivise people who can afford to pay more. This will improve care for all as pressure on the NHS is significantly reduced. Those who rely on the NHS will enjoy faster, better care. Independent healthcare capacity will grow rapidly, providing competition and reducing costs. Firms should be encouraged to offer staff health insurance – this will become standard. Labour will instead add VAT on independent healthcare, which will make the NHS worse off.\nDoctor and Nurse Training.\nEnd training caps for all UK medical students. Write off student fees pro rata per year over 10 years of NHS service for all doctors, nurses & medical staff.\nThereafter:\nPut Patients in Charge With a New NHS Voucher Scheme.\nPatients will receive a voucher for private treatment if they can’t see a GP within 3 days. For a consultant, the time limit would be 3 weeks. For an operation, 9 weeks.\nCut waste, Bureaucracy and Unnecessary Managers.\nFocus on results, not targets. Nail down better prices using economies of scale. Better IT for example. Review all Private Finance Contracts in NHS. Significant savings potential. Remove Lifetime Cap on NHS Pensions. This causes 70% of surgeons to reduce their hours.\nSave A&E.\nGP waiting lists are hitting A&E. Cut waiting times with a campaign of ‘Pharmacy First, GP Second, A&E Last’. More beds in A&E and other parts of the NHS are essential.\nExcess Deaths and Vaccine Harms Public Inquiry.\nExcess deaths are nearly as high as they were during the Covid pandemic. Young people are overrepresented.\nNHS Pledges Costs = £17 billion pa\nThis proposed contract is deliberately issued as a working draft. We welcome your comments, challenges and queries.

But Net Zero is the wrong bit, at the wrong price, in the wrong timeframe. Westminster’s obsession with Net Zero is damaging our livelihoods and the economy. It has sent energy bills soaring. Made it harder for businesses to compete. It is costing tens of thousands of jobs and increasing inflation.\nNet zero means reducing man made CO2 emissions to stop climate change. It can’t. Climate change has happened for millions of years, before man made CO2 emissions, and will always change. We are better to adapt to warming, rather than pretend we can stop it. Up to 10 times more people die of cold than warmth. In Roman Britain some 2,000 years ago, it was 2 degrees warmer than now. Grapes for wine were grown in Yorkshire.\nCO2 is essential for photosynthesis to enable plant growth. CO2 only represents 0.04% of the atmosphere; the average garden greenhouse has 3 times more! The UK produces only 1% of global CO2 emissions, yet China produces 27%. China & India are building hundreds of coal fired power stations. Even the IPCC admits Net Zero would make no difference to sea level rise for 200-1,000 years; in other words they do not have a clue.\nInstead, Net Zero sends our money abroad and damages critical industries like steel production. The government has turned Britain from being an exporter of oil and gas into a net importer. They have bet our future on unreliable wind and solar power and destroyed our energy security. It’s time for a common sense energy strategy.\nCritical reforms needed in the first 100 days:\nScrap Net Zero and Related Subsidies.The UK cost of Net Zero has been estimated by the National Grid and others at some £2 trillion or more. It is so big that no one really knows. The public sector is spending billions each year with no accountability or transparency. Ditching Net Zero would save the public sector some £20 billion per year for the next 25 years, possibly more.\nScrap Annual £10 Billion of Renewable Energy Subsidies.Achieve this through equivalent taxes on them. Renewables are not cheaper. Our bills have increased dramatically in line with the huge increase in renewables capacity over the last 15 years.\nCheap, Secure Energy.\nWe must use the energy treasure under our feet. Start fast-track licences of North Sea gas and oil. Grant shale gas licences on test sites for 2 years. Then enable major production when safety is proven, with local compensation schemes. The value of shale gas is potentially hundreds of billions over 30 years to the taxpayer. This could transform our nations fortunes and ensure prosperity for generations to come.\nThereafter:\nCleaner Energy from New Technology.\nFast-track clean nuclear energy with new small modular reactors, built in Britain. Increase and incentivise UK lithium mining for electric batteries, Combined Cycle gas turbines, clean synthetic fuel and clean coal mining.\nEnergy & Environment Pledges Savings = £30 billion pa\nThis proposed contract is deliberately issued as a working draft.

Paperwork wastes huge amounts of police time. Crime solving is at an all-time low. Charging rates have collapsed to around 5%.\nAs a result, violent crime is at record highs. ‘County lines’ drugs gangs have spread across the UK. Teenage knife crime is out of control. Public confidence in the police is at an all-time low. The police must protect life, property and prevent crime without fear or favour.\nCritical reforms needed in the first 100 days:\nCommence Increase in Police Numbers.\nEngland and Wales have 235 police officers per 100k population. One of the lowest levels in Europe. France has nearly 300 police per 100k population. Commence recruitment to increase UK per capita police numbers to 300 per 100k population. That is 40,000 new front-line officers, over a 5 year parliament.\nCommence Zero Tolerance Policing.\nIt worked in New York. Clampdown on all crime and antisocial behaviour. Prison for all violent crimes and possessing a knife. Half of acquisitive crimes are drug related. Dealing and trafficking will get mandatory life imprisonment. A new offence of Substantial Possession of Drugs will meet heavy fines. Increase Stop and Search Substantially. It is a proven deterrent to knife crime.\nNew Police Leadership & Recruitment Regime.\nStrong preference for ex-military officers and personnel.\nMore Bobbies on the Beat.\nEnsure that police return to the beat and use better technology to stop wasting time on paperwork. Visible policing stops crime before it starts. Allow PCSOs to become police officers before the role is phased out.\nCommon Sense Policing not ‘Woke’ Policing.\nScrap all Diversity, Equality and Inclusion roles and regulations to stop two-tier policing. Protect the public without fear of favour. Reform The Independent Office of Police Conduct (IOPC) so that the police complaints system works for the law abiding public.\nThereafter:\nScrap or Reform Police and Crime Commissioners.\nPCCs do not have sufficient power to make a difference. Yet some employ 30 staff. That could be 30 more police officers on the beat. Either they get the power to make a real change or they should go.\nDe-Politicise the College of Policing.\nInstead, prioritise crime prevention, discipline, public service and high standards of strength and fitness. Replace degree-standard entry with an entrance exam. Require officers to complete a 2-year probationary period.\nPolicing Pledges Costs = £3 billion pa\nThis proposed contract is deliberately issued as a working draft.

Some violent repeat offenders commit over 100 offences, yet are still free to walk the streets. Over 75,000 defendants are awaiting trial at the Crown Court. The police are demoralised and the public are losing trust in the system. We will build a common sense justice system that keeps the public safe.\nCritical reforms needed in the first 100 days:\nUrgent Sentencing Review with Automatic Life Imprisonment for Violent Repeat Offenders.\nThose committing second violent or serious offences will receive mandatory life sentences.\nIncrease the Criminal Justice Budget.\nThe budget is almost the same as it was 10 years ago. Increase it from £10 billion to £12 billion to ensure more high calibre staff to cut delays.\nChange the Definition of Hate Crime.\nThe CPS and police definition of a hate crime has led to systemic bias. Members of the British public must not be investigated because ‘any’ person ‘perceives’ that a hate crime has been committed. Proper evidence must be required. Enforce existing laws to stop violent, hate demonstrations such as the Free-Palestine marches.\nCommence building of 10,000 New Detention Places. Start expansion in capacity of state built and managed prisons so that life means life for those who endanger the public. Commission disused military bases if needed.\nTackle Organised Crime.\nForeign gang crime accounts for most organised crime in the UK at a cost of £37 billion per year. This includes drugs, people trafficking and money laundering through barber shops, car washes and nail bars. Increase budget for both the National Crime Agency and The National Drugs Intelligence Unit.\nThereafter:\nReform the Child Maintenance Service.\nThe CMS is failing children and parents. It should be a Mediation Service and means-tested child support for parents who cannot arrange finances. Launch a special division of the family court for maintenance and defaults. Share parental care 50/50 where appropriate. Rights of access for Grandparents.\nStop Child Grooming Gangs.\nSystematic child sexual abuse continues unchecked. Child Protection Services needs a dedicated National Agency working with local charities, councils and health services. Upgraded intelligence can identify high-risk children and filter malicious claims.\nTackle Youth Crime.\nReopen High Intensity Training Camps for young offenders to teach basic education, teamwork and values. Military veterans can provide role models. This model worked at Thorn Cross in the 1990s. It is needed more than ever.\nJustice Pledges Costs = £2 billion pa\nThis proposed contract is deliberately issued as a working draft. We welcome your comments, challenges and queries.

Teachers are drowning in bureaucracy. Woke ideology is spreading through our schools and universities. We want an education system that ensures young people learn the skills, character and values to succeed in life.\nCritical reforms needed in the first 100 days:\nBan Transgender Ideology in Primary and Secondary Schools.\nThere are 2 sexes and 2 genders. It is a dangerous safeguarding issue to confuse children by suggesting otherwise. No gender questioning, social transitioning or pronoun swapping. Inform parents of under 16s about their children’s life decisions. Schools must have single sex facilities.\nBan Critical Race Theory in Primary and Secondary Schools.\nIt is unacceptable to divide children on grounds of race and teach them to be ashamed of their country.\nTax relief of 20% on all Independent Education.\nNo VAT on Fees: If parents can afford to pay a bit more, we should incentivise them to choose independent schools. This will significantly ease pressure on state schools, so improve education for all. Independent education capacity will grow rapidly, providing competition and reducing costs\nScrap Interest on Student Loans.\nExtend loan capital repayment periods to 45 years. Restrict undergraduate numbers well below current levels, too many courses are simply not good enough and students are being ripped off. Enforce minimum entry standards. Stop backdoor route to immigration through use of low quality degree courses.\nThereafter:\nCut Funding to Universities that Undermine Free Speech.\nThe government’s Free Speech Act is toothless. Allowing political bias or cancel culture must face heavy financial penalties.\nPermanent Exclusions for Violent and Disruptive Students.\nDouble the number of Pupil Referral Units so schools can function safely. Disruptive children must also get support.\nUniversities Must Provide 2 Year Graduate Courses.\nThe option of 2 year courses would reduce student debt and allow earlier entry into employment to help pay it off.\nIncrease Technical Courses and Apprenticeships.\nValue young people with vocational talents. Britain needs skilled workers in engineering, construction, IT and high demand sectors.\nLife Skills Classes at School.\nSubjects such as home economics and social media risk should be part of the school curriculum. No smartphones or social media in schools under 16.\nEducation Pledges Costs = £5 billion pa\nThis proposed contract is deliberately issued as a working draft.

Around 3.7 million of these are not required to look for a job for health reasons. A substantial number are under 34 years of age. This number soared when face to face health checks were replaced by remote assessments.\nWe want an efficient welfare system that helps the genuinely disabled, sick, vulnerable and unemployed to find work. Currently our benefits system encourages dependency and entitlement. This damages mental health, locks people into poverty and wastes talent. Low pay and high tax means many can earn more on benefits than in work. Meanwhile nearly a million job vacancies are unfilled. If you can work you must work. There are too many shirkers and skivers while many with disabilities work hard and pay tax.\nCritical reforms needed in the first 100 days:\nMake Work Pay.\nLifting the income tax start point to £20,000 per year means an extra £1,500 per year. This would be a key incentive for those on benefits to find work.\nStart to Motivate up to 2 Million People Back to Work.\nReforms to benefit support & training will help people back into work. Particular focus on 16-34 year old s. Employment is critical to improving mental health. Tax relief for businesses that undertake apprenticeships.\nEnforce a 2-Strike Rule for Job Offers.\nAll Job seekers and those fit to work must find employment within 4 months or accept a job after 2 offers. Otherwise benefits are withdrawn.\nFace to Face, Not Remote Assessment for Personal Independence Payment.\nHuman contact is critical to build relationships and coach people back into work. We will also require independent medical assessments to prove eligibility for payments.\nThereafter:\nIntegrate Mental Health Services with Job Seeking Pathways.\nBritain’s young people are in the grip of a mental health crisis. Work is a cure not a cause.\nStop Benefit Fraud.\nOverhaul anti-fraud practices to ensure the Department for Work and Pensions cut fraudulent benefit claims to negligible levels.\nBenefits Pledges Savings = £15 billion pa\nThis proposed contract is deliberately issued as a working draft.

It should have allowed us to take our rightful place among the 168 other sovereign nations that succeed outside the European Union. Brexit meant more democracy. More accountability. More freedom.\nBrexit is a great opportunity for which the government has so far failed to take advantage. They have not controlled our borders, not reduced taxes and unnecessary EU laws still hinder growth. The Brexit that 17.4 million voted for, has been betrayed. An out-of-touch political elite is still obstructing the biggest democratic mandate in our history.\nCritical reforms needed in the first 100 days:\nLegislate to Scrap EU Regulations with Immediate Effect.\nBritish Laws on State Aid, Competition, Employment and the environment are still based on EU regulations. Nor have we reversed EU Net Zero laws which are sabotaging our economy.\nLeave the European Convention on Human Rights.\nBritish laws and judges must never be overruled by a foreign court. We must be free to deport those we consider a threat to our country. UK courts must be able to protect British citizens from EU arrest warrants.\nAbandon the Windsor Framework.\nThis is worse than the original Northern Ireland Protocol. The UK has been partitioned down the Irish Sea. Northern Ireland is still in the EU’s single market for goods. British citizens in Northern Ireland are being ruled by EU laws. Now the Tories have agreed to align new UK laws with EU laws.\nThereafter:\nIndependence for Britain’s Armed Forces.\nThe government has signed up to the EU Horizon programme. That means we send money to the European Defence Fund and part of the EU’s military mobility project. David Cameron met his EU counterparts to discuss EU defence policy. Our Armed Forces are at risk of being sucked into an EU Command and Control Force.\nPrepare for renegotiations on the EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement.\nA so-called EU ‘level playing field’ is holding us back.\nThis proposed contract is deliberately issued as a working draft.

Yet grandstanding politicians send our servicemen and women abroad with poor equipment. They have cut the Army to its smallest size in 300 years. Military housing is substandard.\nOur wounded and veterans are often abandoned. Some still face unjust legal claims. We will reform our military covenant so those who put their lives on the line get the support they deserve both during and after service.\nCritical reforms needed in the first 100 days:\nIncrease Defence Spending to 2.5% of National GDP by year 3, then 3% within 6 years.\nThis will increase the size and capacity of our armed forces, ensuring our lead role in NATO. Will improve equipment and boost morale in military communities.\nIntroduce Urgent Pay Review.\nIncrease basic pay across our armed forces to boost recruitment and retention. It is unacceptable that a private soldier is paid less than an Amazon worker.\nIntroduce new Armed Forces Justice Bill.\nProtect our servicemen and women on active duty inside and outside the UK from civil law and human rights lawyers. The bill will also create an armed forces watchdog to fast-track complaints and appeals in housing and welfare.\nNew, Dedicated Ministerial Department for Veterans.\nA properly funded and resourced whole department is essential. The next page has more detail.\nThereafter:\nRegenerate Britain’s Defence Manufacturing and Technology.\nIntroduce incentives and tax breaks to boost the UK defence industry. Improve equipment self-sufficiency and manufacture world class products for export.\nReform Defence Procurement.\nLaunch a Joint Acquisition Corp to ensure world class procurement.

Our veterans have valuable skills which should be used to their fullest potential after leaving the Armed Forces. Their leadership experience, logistics expertise, discipline, determination and can do attitude is unique.\nWe must properly look after veterans who have been wounded and those suffering from health issues. Veterans should not be homeless. Access to pensions and grants must be quick and straight forward.\nThese reforms are the fastest way to solve the Armed Forces recruitment crisis.

Veterans can be best motivators for recruiting new people into the armed forces.\nTake Back Control of Military Accommodation.\nPoorly run and outsourced property management contracts have failed our armed forces.

The Office of National Statistics forecast the population to grow by nearly 7 million between 2021 and 2036, putting huge pressure on housing.\nMass immigration is the main factor in this. Other factors that have damaged housing supply are overly bureaucratic planning regulations that delay decisions and add huge cost.\nCritical reforms needed in the first 100 days:\nReview the Planning System.\nFast track planning and tax incentives for development of brownfield sites, including unused offices and vacant high street properties. Review system of Section 103 Developer Contributions for infrastructure such as schools and surgeries to accelerate house building.\nReform Social Housing Law.\nPrioritise local people and those who have paid into the system. In parts of the UK almost half of all social housing is occupied by someone born overseas. Foreign nationals must go to the back of the queue. Not the front.\nScrap the 2019 Tax Changes for Landlords.\nThe tax system should encourage smaller landlords into the rental markets. Not penalise them.\nAbolish the Renters’ (Reform) Bill.\nExisting legislation was adequate to address bad practices. Instead, we will boost the monitoring, appeals and enforcement process.\nThereafter:\nIncentivise Use of New Construction Technology.\nSuch as modular construction, and smart infrastructure.\nMore Home-grown Qualified Traders.\nNew apprenticeships and vocational courses will increase the supply of skilled, well-paid workers to replace cheap overseas labour.\nHousing Pledges Costs = £ Neutral\nThis proposed contract is deliberately issued as a working draft.

In 2021, more children were born to unmarried couples than to those who were married. Half of all children grow up in separate households. We have the unhappiest teenagers in Europe.\nThis has a devastating impact. On average, children from broken homes suffer from more educational failure, unemployment, homelessness and poverty. They suffer from more mental health issues, substance abuse, crime and imprisonment. This is a social and economic catastrophe that costs taxpayers tens of billions every year.\nCritical reforms needed in the first 100 days:\nSupport Marriage Through the Tax system.\nGermany and France let married couples with children share their tax allowance. British married couples with children deserve the same. As soon as finances allow, introduce a UK 25% transferable marriage tax allowance. This would mean no tax on the first £25,000 of income for either spouse. (Based on our higher income tax starting point of £20,000 per person). This will help make work pay, helping people trapped on benefits back into the workplace so reducing the benefits bill.\nChoice for Stay at Home Mums or Dads.\nThe majority of mothers would choose to stay at home more if they could. ‘Front-loading’ the Child Benefit system for children aged 1-4 would give parents the choice to spend more time with their children.\nMandate Single Sex Spaces.\nPublic toilets and changing areas must provide single sex facilities.\nPromote Child Friendly App Restricted Smartphones.\nReduce social media harms for children.\nThereafter:\nLaunch inquiry into Social Media Harms.\nSocial media is associated with eating disorders, anxiety, depression, suicide and the child mental health crisis. Critically, social media can change both behaviour and belief without the user’s consent. Protect children’s mental health.

The regulators have been asleep at the wheel. Our infrastructure is crumbling. Risk of power cuts has increased. Raw sewage is pumped into our seas. Economic productivity has been damaged. We have given up control over much of our critical infrastructure, meaning national security is at risk.\nCritical reforms needed in the first 100 days:\nScrap HS2.\nSave £25 billion by scrapping the rest of this bloated vanity project.\nStop the War on Motorists. Legislate to ban all ULEZ and Low Traffic Neighbourhoods. We will scrap bans on selling petrol and diesel cars and scrap legal requirements for manufacturers to sell electric cars.\nAccelerate Already Announced Transport Infrastructure.\nFocus on the North.\nThereafter:\nTighter regulation and new ownership model for Critical National Infrastructure.\nConsumers have been ripped-off and failed by weak regulators. Launch a new model that brings 50% of each utility into public ownership. The other 50% would be owned by UK pension funds, benefiting from new expertise and better management. This is a win win situation.\nIntegrated Transport Infrastructure. Launch a national database for councils, contractors, government and utilities to ensure coordination of projects. Less road works, waste and delays.\nNational Water Grid and Reservoirs.\nThe UK is at risk of water shortages. Build new reservoirs in high rainfall areas. Water can be stored and transferred to low rainfall areas when required.

Government subsidies force farmers to meet environmental targets instead of producing food. Fuel and fertiliser costs have spiralled. Farmers have to deal with huge amounts of paperwork. Farmland is being lost to re-wilding and solar farms. High energy costs and supermarket price fixing has pushed many farmers to bankruptcy. Rural communities are dying.\nCritical reforms needed in the first 100 days:\nIncrease the farming budget to £3 Billion.\nFocus on smaller farms. Keep farmland in use. Bring young people into farming. Boost rural economy and culture. Increase innovation and diversification. Help farmers to farm, not pay them to leave or retire.\nScrap climate-related farming subsidies.\nProductive land must be farmed, not be used for solar farms or rewilding. Replace current subsidies with direct payments. Stop Natural England from taking action that damages farmers.\nProtect Country sports.\nThese increase investment in conservation of our environment. They boost rural jobs, communities and local economies.\nThereafter:\nStop supermarket price fixing.\nGrant powers to the Competitions and Markets Authority to ensure fair pricing. Help farmers sell their produce directly to the public. Change planning laws to support farm shops with zero business rates.\nBuy British. Buy quality.\nLittle more than half the food we consume is UK produced. Target 70% to ensure food security. Taxpayer funded organisations should source 75% of their food from the UK. Clear labelling for consumer choice. Boost smaller food processors and abattoirs through tax breaks and other incentives. This cuts transport costs and promotes animal welfare.\nFarming not form filling.\nMany farmers spend over 15 hours a week on paperwork. Cut red tape from HMRC and the British Cattle Movement Service.\nFuture technology & fertiliser supplies.\nFarmers must have access to new technology to boost production and cut costs. UK food security also depends on fertiliser supply and production.\nEncourage young people into farming.\nOffer subsidised courses at Agricultural Colleges and apprenticeships to help young people learn farming ‘craft’ and business management.\nAgriculture Pledges Costs = £2 billion pa\nThis proposed contract is deliberately issued as a working draft.

Yet, the government has not taken back control of our historic fishing grounds. Foreign vessels still plunder our waters and damage the sea bed.

Fishing ports such as Fleetwood, Grimsby, Hull, Lowestoft, Aberdeen are desperate for regeneration. Fishing offers a unique opportunity to achieve this. Every one job at sea creates 8 jobs on the land through processing and support industries. Reform UK will restore the UK’s fishing industry and heritage.\nCritical reforms needed in the first 100 days:\nStop EU Fishers Taking UK Quotas.\nEnd automatic access to UK Waters. Every foreign fishing vessel must pay for a licence to gain access to the UK’s 12 nautical mile zone.\nExpand the Royal Navy Overseas Patrol Squadron.\nPolice British territorial waters properly. Assess the possibility of creating a dedicated coast guard or fisheries protection agency.\nBan Foreign Super trawlers from UK Waters.\nExtend the ban on pair trawling for bass beyond the South East and 12-mile territorial waters.\nStop Foreign Owners Using a British flag of Convenience.\nRequire tax and provenance tests. Ban the trading of fishing quotas. Revisit the 1988 Merchant Shipping Act and strengthen ‘Economic Link’ principles. Reform the quota system to benefit small scale fishing.\nThereafter:\nRebuild UK Fish Processing.\nTax and other incentives to ensure that all fish caught in British waters are landed and processed in the UK. Fish caught by foreign vessels in UK waters should also be landed and processed here when capacity allows.\nRevitalise the UK’s Fishing Fleet.\nTax incentives and vocational training to increase UK fishing fleets. Include fishing communities in policy making.\nLaunch a Sovereign Wealth Style Coastal Fund.\nProceeds from foreign fishing licences must be reinvested in coastal communities.\nGuarantee Sustainable Stocks.\nImplement a ‘dynamic management system’. Work with national and regional partners such as the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission.\nNegotiate with Ireland on Rockall.\nEstablish a legal claim for EEZ. Secure territorial waters.\nFishing and Coastal Communities Pledges Costs = £2 billion pa\nThis proposed contract is deliberately issued as a working draft.

For over 20 years the Tories and Labour failed to tackle the sue of Pensions and Social Care. The system is broken and time is running out. Since the 1950s, larger numbers of young people have funded the smaller numbers of elderly through the tax system. But people are living longer and the percentage of over 65s to the working age population has increased. This change has caused a major funding problem for our elderly and long – term sick.\nCritical reforms needed in the first 100 days:\nCommence Royal Commission of Inquiry into Social Care System.\nA national plan is critical for a sustainable social care system. Collaboration between central government, local authorities, social care providers and home carer support groups is vital to solve the growing challenge. (Flexibility, income tax and VAT breaks are potential factors). Streamlining and simplifying through a single funding stream, not split between NHS ands Local Authorities is essential. Improved regulation is required for this vital service which is part of UK PLC’s infrastructure. Additional funding will be required when a national plan is agreed.\nStop the Offshore Taxpayer Rip Off.\nSome larger care home providers avoiding tax on hundreds of millions of profits through complex offshore property company structures and high interest shareholder loans. At the same time they pay minimal wages to front line care staff.\nThereafter:\nReview Pension provision.\nThe current pension system is riddled with complexity, huge cost and poor returns leading to lower pensions. Other nations like Australia do savings and pensions much better and cheaper than we do, from a much younger age.\nPension and Social Care Reform: TBC\nThis proposed contract is deliberately issued as a working draft.

Please email comments to:\n27: CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM\nThe UK’s constitutional arrangements need Reform.\nWe are ruled by an arrogant and out of touch elite. The two party system is broken. The social contract is broken.\nOur public sector is too often incompetent, wasteful and unaccountable. The Civil Service is no longer neutral. Many public institutions are pro-immigration, pro-remain and left-wing. Patronage around the House of Lords and honours system is leading to corruption in public life.\nWe have a constitutional crisis and our freedoms are at risk. Millions are taxed without proper representation. The British public must have a real, democratic choice on how our country is run.\nCritical reforms needed in the first 100 days:\nLeave the European Convention on Human Rights.\nCommence reform of the Human Rights Act.\nCommence Reform of the House of Lords.\nReplace the crony-filled House of Lords with a much smaller second chamber. Structure to be debated. Immediate end of political appointees.\nCommence Reform of the Civil Service.\nReplace Civil Service leaders with private sector successful people, who are political appointees, who come and go with the government. Enforce the Civil Service code of integrity, honesty, objectivity and impartiality. Ensure better value for money with proper, competitive tendering.\nCommence Reform of the Postal Voting System.\nPostal voting has allowed electoral fraud. We will stop postal voting except for the elderly, disabled or those who can’t leave their homes.\nThereafter:\nProportional Representation Voting for the House of Commons.\nFirst Past the Post is an outdated voting system. Large numbers of voters have no representation in parliament and new parties are shut out of the political system. Voter turnout would be some 10% higher with PR. A referendum is needed.\nA British Bill of Rights.\nOur freedoms must be codified and guaranteed. Political freedom, personal freedom, economic freedom. Never again can our entire country be locked down on shoddy evidence and lies.\nConstitutional Reform Pledges: Neutral\nThis proposed contract is deliberately issued as a working draft.

No one voted for uncontrolled mass immigration. Multiculturalism has led to the growth of separate communities that risk nurturing extremism and the rejection our way of life. Christian values are under threat.\nLabour and the Tories have broken their promises and treated us with contempt. Divisive laws promote minority interests over the majority. Two-tier policing has damaged trust in the police. Freedom of speech has been undermined. Christians are arrested for expressing their beliefs in public. White people can even be barred from applying for jobs. No one voted for this. Yet British taxpayers are forced to fund it. The British people have been lied to, ignored and betrayed.\nCritical reforms needed in the first 100 days:\nAffirm British Sovereignty.\nReject the influence of the World Economic Forum. We will cancel our membership of the World Health Organisation unless there is fundamental reform to its structure and funding. Reform UK also opposes the Creation of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). We will legislate if necessary to stop Britain becoming a cashless society.\nReplace the 2010 Equalities Act.\nThe current Equalities Act requires discrimination in the name of ‘positive action’. It costs the economy billions of pounds, and has become a lawyer’s charter to print money. It has destroyed meritocracy, spread division and led to exclusion for some in majority groups. Scrap all Diversity Equality and Inclusion roles that cost huge sums, create division, inequality and exclusion, and reduce productivity.\nPropose a Comprehensive Free Speech Bill.\nLegislate to stop left-wing bias and ‘woke’ ideology. No more de-banking, cancel culture, left wing hate mobs or political bias in public institutions. Stop Sharia law being used in the UK. All public electoral activity including debates leaflets and other information must be in English.\nCommence Reform of the BBC.\nThe out-of-touch wasteful BBC is institutionally biased. The TV licence is taxation without representation. In a world of on-demand TV People should be free to choose.\nLaunch a Westminster Anti-Corruption Unit.\nThe Covid PPE scandal has raised serious questions about integrity in government. The public watchdog must close the ‘revolving door’ between government and big business. Address potential conflicts of interest. Ask why UK infrastructure costs so much more than other countries. Investigate Chinese espionage and influence over politicians, academics and key decision-makers which the UK Intelligence and Security Committee says is a major threat to national security.\nConstitutional Reform Pledges: Neutral\nThis proposed contract is deliberately issued as a working draft.

The Integrated Plan outlines how we will spend more than £1.1 billion on public services that touch the lives of all residents at every milestone, while also working to protect people in Hertfordshire who need the most support.\nThe proposals for the coming budget year outline increased investment of £128 million compared to 2024/25 to protect, maintain and improve services.\nHighlights from the proposed 2025/26 budget include:\n- Nearly half a billion pounds will be spent supporting 30,000 adults to live well for longer, including an additional £30 million investment to support those providing care, ensuring that caring staff receive a living wage and to offset the increased National Insurance costs. £26m of additional investment will be spent to ensure that the council can meet the expected increase in demand from those requiring care.\n- Just over quarter of a billion pounds will be spent on children’s services, including £28m of additional investment to ensure we can continue to support Children Looked After and children with disabilities.\n- A further £2.8m of funding on top of the previous £7m investment will be made towards our SEND improvement programme ‘Making SEND Everyone’s Business’.\n- £100m will be spent on highways maintenance works to keep Hertfordshire moving, an increase of £6m from the previous year\n- Funding will be made available to improve flood protection and investigations.\n- New Prevention and Health Inequalities Fund of £3.4m to support residents to stay healthy and well and address health inequalities in Hertfordshire over the next three years.\n- Creating a new Carers Hub to allow carers to access greater levels of support\n- Further investment in a Domestic Abuse One Stop Shop to enhance support for people at medium and standard risk\nIn common with councils across the country, the budget has been set in an extremely challenging financial context with increasing demand for services and costs likely to rise over the next twelve months if inflation continues its upward trend and the impact of the introduction of higher employer National Insurance contributions is felt.\nRichard Roberts, Leader of the Council\nWe are now seeking your views on the proposed budget, complete our budget survey by Wednesday 5 February.\nTo reduce the burden placed on taxpayers, we will continue to drive down our own internal costs with plans to deliver £42 million savings by the end of the 2025/26 financial year, which is on top of £46 million savings agreed last year.\nDespite this, the current proposal presents a headline budget that requires the use of £3m of reserves in addition to having to raise Council Tax by 4.99 per cent (including 2 per cent to support Adult Social Care) in April.\nFrom keeping Hertfordshire moving to helping residents who need the most support, we will be spending over a billion pounds delivering services across Hertfordshire and focussing on what really matters to you. The current economic outlook for the country and changes recently made by the government, means that our own costs will rise in 2025, but rather than rest on our laurels, we are working hard to bring these under control so that as little of these additional costs are passed onto you. Years of prudent financial planning have put us in a good position, but once again we are going to have to access our reserves and make significant savings to balance the budget.\nPlease Visit Hertfordshire County Council for more information",

Any reform of local government in Hertfordshire should follow a period of proper consultation with residents, businesses, elected representatives and stakeholders. Looking at the evidence, we should decide collectively what is best for our area. A single unitary council for the county risks diminishing local representation, with decision-making that is remote from the communities we serve.\nWe do not support postponing the county council elections scheduled for May 2025. The Government has indicated that this will only happen in priority areas who have clear and agreed plans. This is not the case in Hertfordshire, so we cannot be in the first phase of these reforms.\nWe recognise that the Government’s white paper sets a clear direction of travel. As Hertfordshire’s district and borough council leaders, we want to work collaboratively with others to agree how we respond to this.

After hundreds of thousands spent on legal costs, the Tories coughed up and settled to avoid a public hearing…\nNow questions are being asked of those involved in what local sources call the “cover-up” of the furlough fraud allegation. A whistleblower sent evidence of the alleged fraud – seen by Guido – to Noel Willcox, Reform’s PPC for Hemel Hempstead. Mark Woods told former agent Drew to work from home “to get access to the government’s 80% of salary support” in March 2020, the furlough continuing for around 18 months. Outgoing MP Mike Penning and Andrew Williams, member of Executive Council of HHCA and now parachuted into the seat as the Tory PPC, were made aware of the evidence. The Interim Report made by the HHCA executive council in 2021 was seen by both Penning and Williams, though they never responded to the sub-committee. Local sources are now questioning why they didn’t act or seek to properly investigate the claims…\nNoel Willcox tells Guido:\n“I have exposed this wrongdoing based on the facts available. In my opinion there is prima facie evidence to consider criminal charges against individual members of Hemel Hempstead Council Authority. Again, in my opinion, the evidence meets the Crown Prosecution Service criteria for investigating a case: ” there is a realistic prospect of conviction and that it is in the public interest”. The Right Honorable Mike Penning needs to explain what action he took in respect of this scandal together with the Conservative Candidate Andrew Williams who at the time was the leader of Dacorum Borough Council. Serious questions need to be asked on behalf of the local taxpayers regarding the money spent on their behalf by our elected officials.”",

One in five Britons say they’ll vote Reform at the next election — should supporting a mainstream party really cost someone their job? Especially when Hightown has no issue employing Labour Party organisers.\nNow, thanks to you, Saba can take his case to the Employment Tribunal and fight for justice. @HightownHA, Hi!

He also said advice from consultants suggesting that by purchasing the building the council would achieve savings.\nAt present the HCC rents The Meadowside House premises, in Apsley at a cost of approx £825k a year and is used by more than 1000 staff.\nCllr Phil Bibby pointed to the financial savings.

I am quite in favour of this proposal.”\nThe decision will not be subject to usual ‘call-in’ procedures, that allow councillors to request that a decision is reconsidered.

Whilst the Council’s five-year plan, built around five key priorities, offers a forward-looking vision, many residents are left questioning its practicality and immediate relevance to their daily lives.\nThe priorities – combating the climate emergency, providing more social housing, enhancing the cultural offer, and promoting equality are ambitious, however, with council tax set to rise by 2.99%, the pressing question is whether this additional financial burden on residents will result in tangible improvements to services?\nConcerns about dwindling local services are legitimate. Residents feel the pinch as they see their tax bills grow yet experience fewer benefits. Projects like climate initiatives, whilst vital for long-term sustainability, raise questions about immediate costs. What specific measures are being proposed, what benefits will they promote, and what additional charges might residents face? Transparency here is crucial.\nSocial housing is another key focus, but it warrants scrutiny. Are the systems for allocation robust enough? Instances of subletting and concerns about fairness in the queue for housing – especially with questions around priority given to new arrivals versus long-standing residents – spark heated debate. Without detailed answers, scepticism will continue to grow.\nIt is vital for the Council to bridge this communication gap. Residents deserve transparency about where their money is going, how priorities are being balanced, and what immediate improvements, if any, they can expect. Until these questions are addressed, it is challenging to hold the Council accountable or ensure these plans translate into meaningful results for the community.\nThis is not just about managing a budget; it is about trust. The Council must recognize that maintaining public confidence is as important as balancing the books. Clear answers and visible action are the first steps toward a stronger, more united district.\nAuthor: Donah Dewar",

I want this to go through the courts because I want Hightown to be presented with a court judgment that says, ‘you were wrong’.”\nMr Poursaeedi, 36, whose father is Iranian, said: “Everybody is feeling this noose around their neck in terms of what they can and can’t say. I find what’s happened to me so absurd, so insane. This is their mentality and you can’t quite believe it.”\nMr Farage told The Telegraph: “The levels of prejudice in our public, private and charitable sectors against anybody with patriotic views - like this man losing his job - are staggering. Hopefully, the UK will follow America where woke is dying very quickly.”\nHe said the case had similarities with his ordeal at the hands of Coutts, the private bank owned by NatWest, which decided to shut down his account after compiling a dossier on his political views.\nToby Young, the founder of the Free Speech Union, the campaign group funding Mr Poursaeedi’s legal claim, said: “Saba has been subjected to a political witch hunt. Being an organiser for Reform, a party that one in five Britons say they’ll vote for at the next election, should not be a reason to deprive someone of their livelihood.\n“It’s particularly egregious when you factor in that Hightown doesn’t have a problem with employing Labour Party organisers.\nHightown should be encouraging its employees to get involved in democratic politics, not punishing them for it.”\nMr Poursaeedi, from Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, began working for Hightown in October 2023 working part-time as maternity cover on a salary of a little over £15,000.\nIn February last year, he applied for and subsequently got a permanent job as a resident involvement officer on a £37,000 salary. On March 12, he voluntarily disclosed he was Reform’s prospective parliamentary candidate for the Harpenden and Berkhamsted constituency as well as the party’s county co-ordinator, a voluntary role carried out for free.\nTwo weeks later, on March 26, Mr Poursaeedi passed his probationary period for his maternity cover role with “glowing” praise - his manager wrote: “He has done himself and the team proud” - only to be told hours later that the permanent job of resident involvement officer had been “withdrawn”.\n‘I couldn’t breathe. I was completely speechless’\nIn filings with the employment tribunal, lawyers for Mr Poursaeedi said he was requested to attend a meeting with Hightown’s director of housing Natalie Sturrock and its head of human resources Kerry Demner.\nAccording to the legal claim, Ms Sturrock informed him that “his activities and public profile with the political party, Reform, gave rise to a conflict of interest with the work he would be doing as a Resident Involvement Officer”.\nAccording to his legal case, Ms Sturrock “claimed that the policies that the claimant would be campaigning for would be in direct conflict with Hightown’s values”.\nShe then went on to give three examples. According to the legal case, Ms Sturrock said that Reform’s anti-immigration policies were incompatible with Hightown’s, which “houses immigrants and supports refugees”; that Reform’s plan to “scrap net zero policies” was in direct contravention of Hightown’s desire to be a net zero company; while on the green belt “Reform wants to preserve it, whereas Hightown wants to build on it”, Ms Sturrock allegedly told Mr Poursaeedi.\nOf the meeting, Mr Poursaeedi said: “I couldn’t breathe. I was completely speechless. My world fell apart. I was completely blindsided. While the job was on the table I had financial stability and the chance of earning some proper money. And then it was all gone. I felt like I was being crushed.\n“I was incredibly emotional. I was breaking down in tears.”\nIn Hightown’s legal defence, the housing association disclosed that the day before the meeting, Ms Sturrock had “identified several comments” that Mr Poursaeedi had made on his X account that included “retweeting comments that England had been destroyed by mass immigration” and “reposting a racist cartoon from the Telegraph newspaper”.\nThe defence document does not identify the specific cartoon but Mr Poursaeedi said he had only retweeted one Telegraph cartoon - the Matt cartoon published in January. The cartoon had originally been tweeted out by Paul Embery, a trade union activist and political commentator.\nIn the cartoon, printed at a time when controversy surrounded attempts by an Abu Dhabi-backed investment fund to buy The Telegraph amid fears the United Arab Emirates would use the newspaper to wield influence, the husband says to his wife, dressed in a burka, “Don’t worry, darling. If the UAE buys The Telegraph I doubt the cartoons will change.”\nMr Poursaeedi said: “It’s just a very, very funny cartoon. I just remember laughing my head off.” he said it had particularly resonated because he had spent some of his childhood in Iran and recalled flights from Tehran back to London where as soon as the plane took off he could recall “women removing their hijabs”.\nAccording to the legal documents, Hightown informed Mr Poursaeedi that he was “now only eligible to apply for roles that were not ‘public-facing’.”\nOn April 4, Ms Demner, the HR head, wrote to Mr Poursaeedi confirming the offer of the job had been withdrawn because “we have been unable to approve your declaration of interest”.\nAfter the job offer was withdrawn, Mr Poursaeedi applied for a number of other jobs with Hightown, needing the money with a toddler and his wife heavily pregnant with their second child.\nHe discovered his role with Reform meant he was even unsuitable for a job as a damp and mould inspector with Hightown. Mr Poursaeedi said the housing association “took him to one side and told him that because of ‘your Reform affiliations’ the role of damp and mould inspector is also off limits”.\nMr Poursaeedi said: “They seemed to think it might cause some distress to tenants if they found out I was a member of Reform.” He added: “You could be a paedophile and probably get the job of damp and mould inspector. But it wasn’t available to people like me who are members of Reform. All I could do was just laugh. I just thought that this keeps getting more and more ludicrous.”\nFor one job that Mr Poursaeedi considered applying for, Ms Demner told him in an email sent on March 28 last year that if he applied, “it would be unlikely to be approved”. She added: “... this is due to it being a customer-facing role and the potential that the residents may feel uncomfortable with the support if they were aware of the political associations.”\n‘I felt like vermin, like some kind of untouchable’\nMr Poursaeedi launched his legal action because his “philosophical beliefs” are “protected” under the Equality Act. In his legal claim, he said he was the victim of “belief discrimination” over his views, which include “prioritising economic freedom, national sovereignty and environmental conservation”.\nHis lawyers accused Hightown of discrimination because they “treated him and his beliefs as inferior and unworthy of respect in a democracy”. Mr Poursaeedi’s lawyers also accused Hightown of harassment by “creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment for him”.\nHis lawyers said that Hightown’s head of governance and its company secretary Trudi Kleanthous had stood as a Labour Party councillor in a local ward in 2019 and was a Labour ward representative in Dunstable. Mr Pursaeedi accused the housing association of operating “double standards”.\nMr Poursaeedi, a former Labour party member who was born in the UK but lived briefly in Iran when his parents were struggling financially in London in the early 1990s, said his dismissal had shaken his faith in the UK.\n“This is not the country it was ten years ago,” he said. “I used to be in the Labour Party and even ran for the Labour Party in 2021 as a local councillor. But like a lot of people who were Labour and are now Reform, all I ever wanted was a better deal for working people. That’s it.”\nHe said of his treatment by Hightown: “I felt like vermin, like I was some kind of untouchable.”\nHe is demanding in the region of £100,000 in compensation but wants vindication in the courts.\nHe says he is “one of the lucky ones” because he discovered his political affiliation had led to his dismissal from his job. He believes there are dozens of people who have lost their jobs because of their Reform links but have never been told explicitly.\n‘Not treated less favourably’ than Labour candidate\nHightown, which employs more than 1,000 staff and manages over 9,000 homes in Hertfordshire, Buckinghamshire and Berkshire, declined to comment when approached by The Telegraph because the legal case remained ongoing.\nIn its defence, laid out in a 27-page document lodged in October, Hightown’s lawyers said Mr Poursaeedi’s links to Reform “did not create any conflict of interest” when applying for his first job as part of the recruitment team because it was “not customer facing”.\nIt said that a search of Twitter had found that Mr Poursaeedi had retweeted a series of comments about immigration, including one in December 2023 which said that “the taxes you pay are being used to house immigrants in social housing. You should be outraged about this”.\nIn its defence, Hightown said it “denies that the claimant was unfairly dismissed for a reason related to the Claimant’s political opinion and/ or affiliations”.\nThe housing association said since his offer of the job of resident involvement officer was “conditional” he was therefore never actually employed in that role and so could not be dismissed from it. The housing association said in any event it denied the “principal reason for any dismissal” was linked to his “political opinions and/or affiliations”.\nIt also denied any claim of harassment or claim for discrimination. It said that Mr Poursaeedi was “not treated less favourably” than Ms Kleanthous, the company secretary who had stood as a Labour candidate in 2019.\nRobert Mendick The Telegraph Chief Reporter 10 January 2025 1:00pm GMT\nsource: https://archive.ph/hmHJl#selection-3529.5-3537.32",

We must know who is coming in and who is going out of the country, at our airports and ports. Again, this is basic common sense.\nLet’s welcome those who have high level skills and talents that we need —such as doctors, engineers, software developers, scientists and surgeons — in tightly controlled numbers that meet our requirements.\nNet zero immigration means that the number legally allowed to enter to live and work in the UK each year should equal the number emigrating, so the overall population remains approximately the same. Some 400,000 people leave every year so there is plenty of scope for bringing in the skills and people we need.\nThis policy will mean wages for lower paid will rise, it will help young British workers and so help to significantly reduce the number of people on out of work benefits. It will reduce pressure on affordable housing and public services, given that we already have a record high population. We want these valuable people to come and work in the UK legally, and play by the rules, respecting our values.\nIllegal immigration is unacceptable and those entering illegally must not be granted asylum in the UK. Reform UK is the only party committed to stopping the boats. We must adopt the tactics used by Australia when they stopped the boats.\nWe must declare a national security threat, leave the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), and use existing legislation robustly to stop this illegal trade. We must also use offshore processing centres as Australia did.\nWe must also create a new Department f Immigration staffed with people who believe in the task at hand, to protect our borders. The Home Office is simply not fit for purpose\nEveryone must know that no-one coming via these illegal routes will not be allowed to stay in the UK.\nCases must be determined in just a few weeks and people returned to where they came from. The vast majority of the claimants are economic migrants or from Albania under the oversight of their criminal gangs.\nThe cost to the taxpayer is already billions every year and the impact on local communities around the country is very significant. However most people who are concerned are afraid to speak out on this issue for fear of being labelled or smeared.",

My first experience of being involved in a general election was in 1983. Since then, I have gained a BA Honours degree in Government and Politics and remained politically active in various ways. I subsequently went on to work as a College Lecturer in Politics and Business Studies in an FE College in Harrow. While there, I also gained a further Master of Arts (MA) degree in Government and Politics, as well as a teacher-training qualification: the Certificate in Education (Post-Compulsory Education) – i.e. to teach at Further and Higher Education level. I also worked as a GCE Advanced Supplementary (AS) and Advanced (A) Level Examiner in Politics for the University of London Board.\nI was elected to serve as a Councillor in Watford Central Ward between 1995 and 1999. During that time, I chaired their Grants Committee and held a number of Vice-Chair positions on a number of other council committees. I additionally served on the boards and management committees of a number of local community, social and charitable organisations.\nI took early retirement in 1997 and decided not to stand for re-election as a Councillor in 1999 so that I could spend more time with my wife.\nMy wife unexpectedly died in 2001, which left me considerably uncertain as to what I should be doing with my life. I ended up taking on a role of Manager of a local community centre for 9 years and Chair of Governors of a local primary school for 4 years. I was Chair of Watford Area Arts Forum for 6 years and became a Life Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts.\nSince then, I have gradually re-entered political engagement by joining the Reform UK Party as a member and election candidate.\nThe reason I decided to join Reform UK was because I liked their policies – especially national ownership of public utilities.\nI also believe strongly in the concept of democracy and I further believe that the stale old LibLabCon parties have betrayed the 2016 mandate the people of the United Kingdom gave to them to take the UK out of the European Union.\nAs the successor party to UKIP and the Brexit Party, Reform UK now offers the people of Great Britain and Northern Ireland an opportunity to have their voices listened to for the very first time in the history of our country.\nThis is why Reform UK is absolutely committed to reforming the UK national electoral system, reforming the cronyism of the second parliamentary chamber (usually known by the title of House of Lords) and reforming the system of national governance and administration such that popularly elected government ministers will henceforth have the power to command recalcitrant civil servants to do as they are told by elected ministers.\nWith Reform UK, the clue is in the name.\nWe want to see root and branch reform of the rotten and corrupt system of politics and governance within our United Kingdom. We offer an absolutely historic choice to all of our people to be able to vote for – and achieve – real and meaningful change in the UK. We WILL get Brexit done properly and we WILL change our system of elections and governance FOR THE BETTER.\nI am honoured to be acting in the Role of Chairman of Watford Constituency Reform UK Party.\nWe welcome all forms of support and any and all new members who wish to join us in our historic quest.\nJohn L.

I have lived here for 27 years. I have been a Councillor both locally and for East Herts District. I have also been privileged to be Mayor of Sawbridgeworth, 2019 to 2020. I am privileged to have been selected as Spokesperson for Hertford and Stortford.\nAfter being forced into a Siberian Gulag in 1939 and subsequent liberation from Siberia in 1941, my father made the trip mainly on foot through Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and what was then Persia to Palestine where he enlisted (underage) with the Army. He served both in the Karpathian Lancers attached to the British 8th army in both North Africa and Italy, where he was wounded out at Monte Casino. From there, owing mainly to his ability to fix radio receivers for the RAF and being good at Maths (a talent that has bypassed me), his RAK colleagues got him a transfer to the RAF here in the UK and was adopted as a Navigator in 301 Squadron, Bombers.\nMy mother was a fashion designer and worked with Susan Small in the pre-war years. Her specialities were cocktail dresses and ball gowns! She was from North London. She was evacuated to East Finchley following the tragic death of her two brothers (my uncles) during the Blitz in the Angel, Islington, where they had small factories producing artificial horizons for the RAF and theodolites for the RN.\nFrom all of this background of triumph over adversity, I think that I have always had the guts and determination to succeed in what I truly believe.\nI believe that this great country of ours has lost its way in the world and although we still stand for the rights of free speech and personal dignity, some of the many other contributions to world advancement have been forgotten.\nThe pride that we have lost in this great country is mainly down to apologists and weakness on so many fronts; from being the first country to fight against slavery to the world leadership in aeronautical engineering and advancement, we have thrown away our good name and it is time to re-think how we present ourselves on the world stage.\nWe are suffering an invasion of illegal immigrants which has to stop. We cannot rely on our European neighbours to help in this matter. As was the case so often in History, we are on our own and will have to act on our own. We are and have always been willing to be of assistance to those who are really in need, but the current situation is unsustainable, but only Reform has the determination to deal with this thorny issue.\nI have fought locally against crazy housing developments locally, but we have to take a stand nationally against unbridled house construction that does not seem to have been located sensibly or with any infrastructure in mind. We have this locally here in Hertfordshire as I am sure many other people do too.\nCommon sense seems to have been thrown away with the bath water. We have a great message to deliver but somehow we are stifled by the established media who are in reality scared of our message. This is evident at every turn of the page of current affairs.

There’s little difference in policy between the Conservatives and Labour. Only Reform UK believes in a small State where we have more control over our own lives. Only Reform UK will end the Net Zero insanity that makes us poorer, less competitive and just exports CO2 emissions to other countries. Only Reform UK will reduce taxes and accelerate growth. Only Reform UK wants to control immigration and will radically reform our public services, including the NHS, to make them fit for purpose.\nIf you want change you have to change your vote.\nI’m not a politician and to be honest don’t want to be one. BUT we need change and I’m committed to making it happen.\nI’m a British Army veteran, CEO of the UV Group Plc and married with two kids and two dogs. This experience makes up for any inexperience in politics and better to represent and fight for the people of Hertsmere.\nUntil 2019 I had little interest in politics but became engaged after the result of the 2016 was ignored. I joined the Brexit Party and was selected as the Prospective Parliamentary Candidate for Epping Forest.\nThe fight is now to Change Politics For Good and what I’m here to do.",

However, a once great country is steadily being ruined by the self-serving political elites that run the Conservative and Labour parties. I joined Reform to do something concrete about it.\nFor the first half of my career I worked in metals manufacture, often in specialist areas such as tungsten or catalyst production. I have run departments, factories and a small company. Due to the steadily falling size of that industry, I moved into IT, where I’ve worked for a large multi-national software company and the world’s leading cyber security company. Unlike many of our politicians, who studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics at university, then tried to get elected as an MP as soon as possible, I’ve lived and worked in the real world – not inhabited the Westminster bubble. Reform stands for practical, real-world solutions, and not gesture politics from politicians who are insulated from the worst effects of the damage they cause. I loathe political spin with a passion, and believe in being honest with voters. There are hard choices ahead, and economic pain. As a country, we can no longer afford to pretend those problems don’t exist – like Labour and the Tories do. We must address them urgently, and I firmly believe Reform’s policies are the best way to do that.",

This move makes Hall the first ever Reform UK Councillor within any borough in Hertfordshire.\nExpressing his disillusionment with the Conservative Party, Hall stated, “I have decided to leave the Conservative Party as now more than ever I believe it no longer represents conservative values... I believe the future must be with Reform UK.”\nFollowing closely, Siobhan Monaghan, the ward councillor for Cheshunt South & Theobalds, also announced her defection to Reform UK on Monday, February 3, 2025, becoming the second councillor in Hertfordshire to join the party within just 24 hours. Monaghan shared her reasons, saying, “I have become increasingly frustrated to see what is happening to our country and its people both at a local and national level. Only Reform UK have stepped forward and given us a clear path to change.”\nHamish Haddow, the Reform UK Broxbourne Branch Chair and Hertfordshire County Organiser, celebrated these developments. \"This is an exciting time for Reform UK and Broxbourne,\" Haddow declared. He further praised both Hall and Monaghan for their commitment to their communities and their alignment with Reform UK's vision. \"Broxbourne is now blessed with two Reform UK Councillors, and with this addition, we can begin to make a real difference,\" he added, emphasizing the urgent need for reform in the region.\nThese defections reflect a broader national sentiment of seeking new political pathways amidst dissatisfaction with traditional parties. Both councillors have expressed a strong belief in Reform UK's potential to better serve the residents of Broxbourne by addressing key issues like crime, migration, military investment, and leveraging Brexit benefits. This development signals a dynamic shift in local politics, indicating a growing appetite for change and new representation in Broxbourne, Hertfordshire.",

Will Dickinson, a sixth-generation farmer, from Harpenden, said the illegal dumping is impacting himself and other farmers financially, and it is also harming the environment and ruining the countryside in the Hertfordshire town.\nThe National Farmers’ Union (NFU) has long campaigned for more action to tackle the issue of fly-tipping. The NFU approximates that at least two thirds of farmers have been impacted by fly-tipping and the clear-up costs the industry tens of millions of pounds a year.\nThere is also a big strain on the public purse as local authorities and the Environment Agency deal with rubbish dumped on public land. Dumped rubbish also causes disrupts wildlife and pollutes land and watercourses.\nMr Dickinson, who runs an arable farm, said: “Fly-tipping is as bad now as it has ever been. It’s happening here almost every day. We’ve had all sorts of things dumped - from green waste, to nappies to bathroom suites.\n“We’ve even had asbestos left on the fields, meaning we’ve been unable to harvest areas of land, which is a huge inconvenience and cost to the business. This is one of the very few crimes where the victim has to pay the costs.”\nHe added: “It is legally the responsibility of the landowner to pay for removing the rubbish. Those who do get caught often receive a small fine when the landowner, the victim, has to pay out much more to clear up the mess.\n“Fortunately the local police sergeant here is hot on it and the district council has done a lot of work to try to tackle fly-tipping. But they need more power and the NFU is continuing to make our case with decision makers.”\nThis comes after it was reported earlier this year that fly-tipping cases across the country had fallen marginally. However, the figure - which is over a million incidents reported - is much higher than those recorded in 2018/2019 and 2019/2020, and part of a concerning overall trend.\nThis prompted the NFU to emphasise their call for immediate action to tackle fly-tipping on farmland. This includes making it simple for members of the public to reduce and recycle waste, and appropriately punish offenders who are caught dumping waste illegally with stronger fines.\nThe NFU also demand a consistent approach across the country where police, government agencies and local authorities are working more closely together to tackle the problem. The NFU believes the entire system needs to tackle fly-tipping at the source, from packaging design, recycling, landfill tax and tip opening hours, to make it simpler for the public to reduce, re-use and recycle waste.\nThey add that fair penalties should act as a deterrent to potential offenders - as well as more frequent enforcement measures - which are key to addressing the crime. A spokesperson for Hertfordshire Constabulary said: “We continue to work with farmers who are affected by fly-tipping, and have increased patrols in affected areas as a result.\n“We are working extremely closely with the council fly-tipping team and assist them with the installation of preventative measures, including cameras. When a fly tip is reported or found, we ensure we are looking for evidence and anything we find we pass to the relevant team. Both the police and council are doing everything they can to prevent and detect fly-tipping.\n“Fly tipping is illegal, and if you see it in action please call the police on 999 and report it as a crime in progress. You can also report all fly-tipping to your local council, whether your saw it in progress or not. For more information, please check the council’s SCRAP campaign (Let's SCRAP fly tipping | Hertfordshire County Council).”",

This also acts as a brake on our growth rate.\nReform UK knows that with better leadership, better buying, better decisions, this waste of our money can be cut right back, without affecting front line services.\nThis needs real reform of the civil service — with more accountability — for quality performance. It needs more successful private sector people coming into the civil service to use their skills to help get better value for the Government.\nLet’s make it part of our moral duty to society — to give something back.\nOne of the worst areas of wasteful government spending is ineffective foreign aid. Our civil servants struggle to give away the billions of pounds each year, so they end up giving money to the EU and other global bodies to help spend it. We would reduce the foreign aid budget by 50%, down to a still generous 0.35% of GDP.",

After his parents divorced in 1974, his mother brought him and his sister back to England, settling in Bearsted, Kent. Hamish cherished his time in England but, at age 10, moved back to Cape Town, South Africa, to join his father, who had established a dental practice there.\nIn Cape Town, Hamish attended SACS (South African College High School). He thrived, excelling in academics and sports. On retirement his dad moved the family to a farm near Harare, purchased after winning the Zimbabwe lottery. Hamish completed his secondary schooling at St. George’s College in Harare. He attended college in Cape Town, graduating with a degree in business.\nLiving under racial segregation in South Africa and Rhodesia gave Hamish a clear perspective on freedom, fairness, and the power of faith and family. He saw first hand how communities oppressed by unjust systems found strength in unity and moral clarity. These lessons, combined with the values instilled by his British grandparents, shaped his commitment to family values and conservative principles of unity, responsibility, and standing up for what is right.\nIn 2015, Hamish returned to Britain with his wife and children, eager to pass on the values of faith, liberty, and responsibility. Dismayed and upset to see these principles abandoned and working-class communities burdened by unchecked immigration, failing services, and rising crime. Realizing, a need for urgent change and dedicated to restoring Britain’s strength drove him into politics joining Reform UK to work towards restoring Britain’s legacy of liberty, innovation, conservative values, and community strength.\nWhen not engaged in public service, Hamish enjoys spending time with his family and drawing on his love for rugby and chess to mentor the next generation.\nHis unwavering dedication to his community and country continues to guide his mission: to build a brighter future while honouring the greatness of Britain’s past.",
