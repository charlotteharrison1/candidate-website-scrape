While the Tories push for a deal just to avoid a party split, local plans and priorities in Wiltshire are being distorted to favour a Brexit that nobody wants.\nDoes anyone believe the Government's promises to end austerity? In the last year, support for local services have continued to be cut with schools and local NHS trusts suffering at every point. Despite clever words, our road budgets are being reduced, police and fire services cut while investment in social and community care is at rock bottom.\nBrexit is not only draining the country of money, it is also taking focus away from our day to day needs. The number of civil servants and local authority employees who have been seconded to deliver the Tory no-deal plan has been astonishing. At both national and local level resources are diverted to plan for emergency ferry services, emergency food supplies, drug banks and other pointless facilities that we wouldn't need if we remained in Europe.\nSoft Brexit or hard Brexit? It's time to stop and take stock. While the Tories are tearing themselves apart over the issue and Labour continues to aimlessly ponder a tepid response, Liberal Democrats are the only party who continue to campaign to stop this pointless waste and seek a vote to reverse this flawed and tragic decision.\nWe see the UK remain at the heart of Europe, contributing to Europe's stability, providing leadership and feeding into the development of the Continent. We see the continuation of open borders as critical for business, for culture, for learning and the quality of our lives. Membership of the EU affords continued opportunities for our children and for future generations. Brexit closes the door and removes a very important route for cultural exchange.\nWe have consistently campaigned to stop Brexit and will seek to work with other groups who share our view. It's time for you to consider - is this the right time to come and support us?\nHowever, a vote for us is much more than a vote to remain in Europe see our current campaigns.",

It seems wrong to be able to put family members and friends on the public payroll with no independent scrutiny.\nTo be able to claim normal living expenses such as council tax as a chargeable expense or to claim any amount under £250 with no proof of expenditure defies belief. Politicians must accept that their privileged status should not protect them from the basic standards that ordinary voters are expected to abide by on a daily basis.\"\nWendy went on to say, \"No doubt our local MP can provide good reasons why he has charged the UK taxpayer for the expenses he has claimed and we look forward to hearing them in due course. But the rules should be clear and well understood by all. There should be an open and independent procedure to audit expenses with clear mechanisms to investigate any issues that arise.\"",

State control of personal identity details is a real threat to our civil liberties. The Government should respond to the anger and now abandon its ID card scheme. It is clear that the Government cannot be trusted to manage effectively mass databases of personal information.\n\"The Liberal Democrats opposed Identity Cards when the scheme went through Parliament. We said the scheme would be expensive, misguided and insecure. This latest debacle shows just what is at risk.\n\"That is why I have written to Gordon Brown urging him to think again. The Government must end the Identity Card scheme for good in order to ensure that we do not risk a personal data disaster on an even more catastrophic scale.\"",

  "https_www_eastwiltslibdems_org_uk_/https_www_eastwiltslibdems_org_uk_news_article_the-a303-stonehenge-tunnel/content_32.html": "The A303 Stonehenge Tunnel\nSave Stonehenge World Heritage Site (SSWHS) have been given permission to appeal the decision made earlier this year by Mr Justice Holgate rejecting the second judicial review of the Government's decision to approve the £2.5bn road scheme.\nThe appeal came after the Department for Transport approved the tunnel last year.\nIt seemed at the end of 2023 that the legal challenges had been fully exhausted, but we now have the Court of Appeal, and possibly Supreme Court to follow. Given the imminent election, we can with certainty say that the scheme will now be determined by the next Government alongside the verdict of the judiciary.\nThere is no doubt that the A303 needs improvement, and local residents in Amesbury and the Till Valley would welcome relief from holiday drivers trying to find a route around the jams. But, the project carries a staggering £2.5 bn price tag and may lead to the removal of Stonehenge from UNESCO's list of World Heritage Sites. The damage to this globally historic site would be irreversible and road journey time improvements rely on the completion of all eight proposed A303 schemes, some of which are not yet funded. The NAO questioned the marginal value of the project – delivering only an estimated £1.15 of value for every £1 spent with even this marginal return only achieved by including and assessing the value of \"cultural heritage\". Without this inclusion the return is only 30p, and this is without factoring any cost overruns. By comparison, the NHS estimates that it needs £2bn for urgent building maintenance to prevent catastrophic failures across the estate (https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/dec/14/hospitals-falling-to-bits-as-nhs-england-faces-record-repairs-bill-of-12bn)\nSo, it has taken 30 years to gain approval for scheme that delivers questionable value and places a UNESCO World Heritage Site at risk. Meanwhile, the mainline railway serving the West Country remains unelectrified, unreliable, and expensive, with the 300-mile journey from London to Penzance taking over 5 hours. A fast, efficient, cost-effective electrified rail service is as equally important as creating another dual carriageway, but there are only minor works planned for this route. There have been four Conservative transport ministers in just four years and the short-term thinking shows. We have made incredibly slow progress in entirely the wrong direction.\nI have spoken to residents all along the Wishford Valley, Berwick St James, Winterbourne Stoke, Amesbury and Durrington and of course have read SSWHS and many other websites and I know how widely views vary and how passionately and well-founded these different views are.\nI will no doubt have gaps in my knowledge, and always have much to learn but my opinion, genuinely held, is that we will have to solve this problem at some point and make progress. The major freight and passenger routes that link the South West Somerset, Devon and Cornwall need to be efficient. Our local communities need relief from the overspill traffic that chokes roads and blights lives. This means that the A303, and the railway needs investment.\nIf this scheme, after so many years of exploration of all other options is the only scheme that can be approved my view is that we need to make progress and that it should go ahead. BUT - only when the country can afford it above other very pressing priorities, and only if the remaining A303 corridor schemes are funded and progressed, alongside investment in South West Rail links.\nAs noted above, the bill just for the most urgent repairs for our hospitals is $2.5Bn and for further context, the backlog of repairs for our existing roads is $16Bn. We have to fix our roof, before we build a new extension.\nI am aware from everyone I have spoken to that this response will not please everyone, and is perhaps a first political lesson in that regard, and I am of course happy and willing to discuss the views I set out here.\nFinally, if the project does proceed then huge efforts will need to be made to mitigate the works to minimise the potential disruptions and harm to local residents. We need to look again at the proposed disposal sites for the huge volume removed spoil to prevent adverse impacts on Winterbourne Stoke. We need to make sure Shrewton’s future traffic reduces, having already endured significant additional traffic since the changes made at Airman’s corner. Residents of Amesbury deserve reassurance that their lives will not be adversely affected for years by construction activities and redirected traffic. Moreover, it is imperative to ensure that a substantial portion of the investment benefits the local economy, and that opportunities to link the monument to local communities by cycling and on foot are seized.\nIf given the opportunity to represent East Wiltshire, I am committed to prioritizing the status of the project with the new Government. If it does proceed, I will collaborate with experienced local Councillors from all parties, many of whom have worked tirelessly on this project so far. Together, we can navigate the challenges and strive for a community-centred approach to solving this very difficult issue.",

Henry is in his second year at Southampton University.\nI work as the Deputy Manager of Townsend Barn Nursery at Poulshot. In 2016 I graduated from Oxford Brookes University with a degree in Early Years Education and Development. It was a struggle working, studying and, as a single parent, making a home for my children but I'm very proud of this achievement.\nI am also the Nursery's special educational needs co-ordinator. It is so important that children who need help get it as early as possible as this makes a big difference to their long term outcomes. Children's education is a passion of mine and I've have been involved in the Liberal Democrat campaigns to save Braeside and Rowdeford special school.\nFamily and friends have all said I will be the strong voice our area needs. I will work together with all the town councillors to demand better for the people of Devizes.\nOne key issue facing Devizes at the moment is the parking in Market Place - we need to maintain as much free parking as possible in order for local businesses to thrive. This matter needs to be taken back to Wiltshire Council now that the strong feelings of the people of the town are clear.\nDuring my recent canvassing a number of people have discussed the issue of the potholes in the roads and the poor condition of the pavements in Devizes East.

Good of you to come with the other rival attraction on television.\nI live in this constituency and have done so for over 20 years, I've worked here, volunteered here, used the NHS here, used the public transport here, driven here and watched as successive governments national & local have overseen the closure of Post Offices - Village Schools - and Hospital Services.\nMany of you know of my interest in transport and my work with PVTAG on the Wigglybus project. Now being cut back since Wiltshire Council took it over and dispensed with the community advice and involvement. I have also been involved in various ways with CPRE and VAK. Currently I am involved with PCAP looking at Education & leisure.\nSince my Mother died I have gone back to teaching mathematics to those who find it a bit challenging.\nWhy do I want to be an MP? because I think that it is about time that the interests of those of us who live in Rural Britain were represented at Westminster.\nToo often we are treated as an annoying anomaly to the policies of urban bureaucrats.\nWe need an MP to fight for the solutions that fit us here\nI wish to thank Marlborough Council of Churches for organising this hustings. Real Democracy.\nI will take the opportunity to tell you a little about our Liberal Democrat policies but first I want to say something about the state of our democracy.\nIs democracy best served by two grown men shouting at each other once a week? Cheered on by others who might be supporting their local football team? Is it well served by an un-elected second chamber? By MP's and governments elected by less than half of those voting? By the date at which we all have the chance to vote in a general election being at the whim of the Prime Minister?\nI don't think so. Fixed term parliament, proportional representation, an elected second chamber and a written constitution are things that Lib Dems have been calling for for years. I think their time has come. Liberal Democrats will Restore and protect hard-won British Civil Liberties with a Freedom Bill.\nIt may be taking a little longer but I still want to break the mould of British Politics just as I did when I joined the SDP.\nLabour, well they seem to have had a road to Damascus conversion to these ideas as the election has drawn near. Not good enough, they have had 13 years to introduce these reforms and they have not done it.\nOne of the issues that is top of the agenda for many people in this area is the NHS.\nYou have seen your hospital modernised and then your services withdrawn - what a waste of money?\nWe will give people the power to have a say in how their local NHS is run and stop hospital closures in their area. We will devolve power to local people through elected health boards - if they don't listen then you will be able to vote them out.\nWe will make it illegal for a local health board to allow a doctor to work in the UK for the first time without passing robust language and competence tests.\nWe will ensure that local GPs provide out-of-hours care.\nWe will integrate health and social care.\nLiberal Democrats are totally committed to the NHS. Free at the point of use - care when you need it, regardless of your ability to pay. But that is just our starting point. The real challenge we face is to improve the NHS at a time when the public finances are in a mess.\nLiberal Democrats will halve the size of the Dept of Health over the next parliament and reinvest the money in patient care. We will cut the number of health guanos by a third and abolish the strategic health authorities.\nFair Tax\nVince Cable's proposal to raise the threshold for paying income tax to £10,000 will lift many low paid workers and pensioner right out of paying income tax. Most people will be £700 a year better of. It will be paid for by closing the unfair tax loopholes exploited by the very rich, pollution taxes and by the mansion tax.\nThis is money that will help the economy to recover.\nVince Cable is very clear about how we tackle the economy. First you do not risk the recovery until it is clearly underway. Then you look at what government spends, you prioritise and you cut out the unnecessary. Examples include no like for like replacment of Trident, expensive IT projects that don't work, that's ID cards and the health service system that does not work, the next traunch of the Eurofighter.\nA pay cap of £400 for public sector workers\nWe will introduce a Bank levy so that the Banks pay for the help they have received and we will break them up so it can't ever happen again. Not tax breaks for a narrow group.\nNow there has been a lot of talk about efficiency savings. Think we might know a bit about this here don't you. How our Tory led Councils told us that if we had a single Unitary Council there would be efficiency savings, they would have the money for things like mending the roads - what have we got, a higher than average council tax rise and pot holes in the road so big they are a danger to cyclists.\nEducation\nThere is one area where we think extra spending is called for and that is education\nA fair chance for every child\nOur plans for a pupil premium will give over £11million to schools in Wiltshire. Money Head Teachers can use to raise standards and outcomes for all our children. They might use it for extra staff to make class sizes smaller or to give extra help to those who fall behind.\nYou've been let down by Labour for the last 13 years. You've had 65 years of Labour and Conservative Governments taking it in turns to make the same old mistakes over and over again.\nIn Marlborough and Durrington you have been well served by Liberal Democrat Councillors for many years, now is the time to take it a step further and be represented in Westminster by a Liberal Democrat.",

It was disconcerting to discover at the beginning that I could not tell who were prisoners and who were other visitors or education staff. And so many of them were much younger than I had imagined and as I later learnt on indeterminate sentences - they don't know when they will be released.\nI already knew that the level of debate would be high from the questions we had seen ahead of time, but their level of concentration and the supplementary questions and comments was impressive. As I looked round the room some of the eyes were wary but that faded as they found that we didn't all say the same things and they could agree with one panellist on one subject but not on another. At the end one said to me \"I hope my question won't get me into trouble\". I enquired and was assured it would not.\nGiven the opportunity they were eager to talk to us individually as a conversation started others would join the group and join in, on one occasion to quietly tell me that someone had committed suicide last week. The questions and comments lacked worldly cynicism; in fact they have a touching certainty that we the people from the outside can change things. The flip side of this is that most do not seem to realise the 'red top' fuelled view the public have of Prisoners.\nI hear in my head now one describe himself as \"one of you\" because he had been a Councillor, another tell me he read politics at university and another proudly tell me how he had gained 4 diplomas.

  "https_www_eastwiltslibdems_org_uk_/https_www_eastwiltslibdems_org_uk_news_article_dairy-farming-in-wiltshire/content_26.html": "Dairy Farming in Wiltshire\nIf you live in Wiltshire for 30 years you will get to know a farmer. One who has become a great friend tells me regularly about the issues he faces not with farming itself, but the regulations and subsidy framework that surrounds it. The mechanics of the primary task of making money by selling what you produce made tortuous by this external influence, with change often badly managed and implemented by DEFRA.\nImpact of Brexit and External Factors\nBrexit of course bought farming into sharper focus as a settled subsidy and supply landscape was suddenly subjected to huge variables. Where would our food come from? Where would we export our food to? How would we move away from the EU Common Agricultural Policy? What regulations would now govern farming and food safety? We all also suffered the shocks of the Ukraine war and related inflation that have raised fertiliser and fuel costs dramatically.\nExperience at Berkley Farm Dairy\nSpending time on a farm provided firsthand insights into current farming practices. I’m grateful for the time of Nick, Chris and Ed Gosling who spent so much patient time with me at Berkley Farm Dairy in Wroughton explaining the mechanics of milk and dairy production.\nWith the dairy farm right next to their own dairy processing unit, traceability is easy – and food miles are minimal. The farm delivers about 2,000 litres a day up the track, from its herd of 240 Guernsey cows in a refrigerated trailer towed by a Land Rover. It is then processed same or next day (if delivered on a Sunday) into pasteurised Gold Top milk and butter. Immediately to doorstep in glass bottles by a far-reaching electric van delivery service (no floats, these are Mercedes Vitos!).\nFarming Practices and Challenges\nBut I’ve jumped straight to the milk. Back at the farm, Nick farms the herd as his family has done for 3 generations. On the morning I met him, he had just had a follow up TB test. You need to have 2 clear tests to have all restrictions removed. TB remains an issue, but badger culling locally has worked. Any cow that reacts with the test would be immediately sent to slaughter. This is very distressing especially when the farmer has bred, reared, and cared for the animal as carefully as Nick.\nCows of different ages were segregated into sheds – the ground still too wet back then for any periods outside, so feeding was inside. Nick has installed an automated German made elevated monorail robotic feeder, salvaged almost unused from another farm and adapted to fit. When the cows are inside the sheds, the whole feeding process is almost totally automated reducing waste and ensuring consistency of feed mix. Nick is rightly proud of this. Feed to yield is critical for profitability. The farm is organic, so uses no nitrate on the soil, but creates huge silage sausages that are gradually uncovered for winter feed. The cows have no preventative antibiotic treatment, and Chris (Nick’s wife) adopts a homeopathic approach to welfare looking at coat colour, yield and other variables. Each animal sits as a data point on a wheel, tracking yield performance and health.\nMost of the moving vehicles on the farm belong to a neighbour who provides them as a service on a contracting basis. Nick noted “Years ago, farmers would keep to themselves and resent another farmer on your farm. Nowadays we specialize and share, it’s much better and more efficient – and friendlier”. Capital costs of machinery means that they need to be working somewhere to pay their way, not idly sitting in a shed.\nMilk Production vs Environmental Stewardship\nThe milking parlour is fitted with Automatic Cluster Removal apparatus. This detects when the milk flow rate falls to a pre-set “take-off” level and disconnects the apparatus preventing over milking. Each cow receives a top up feed in its stall to boost milk production further. I didn’t get to see this happening on the day- but was offered a chance to come back. The whole farm is very impressive and a real testament to the animal and environmental husbandry delivered by Nick and Chris\nWe took a long walk to the Eastern boundary of the Farm to get a glimpse of the bluebells. Nick walks this at least twice a day and I can see why. Even the M4 looks great when you are looking at it from this vantage point. We talked about rural crime (cyclical, none currently), fly-tipping (a huge and expensive and annoying issue) and then got onto subsidies and the regulatory framework. Nick was clear , subsidies are a way of ensuring that food is affordable. No farmer wants them, but it means that farm gate food prices are lower than they otherwise would be and are more predictable. This means that they are here to stay.\nFuture of Farming\nThe move from the EU Common Agricultural Policy has been complex. The interim measure was the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) which tapers off until 2027. The Countryside Stewardship (CS) scheme provides financial capital incentives for farmers to look after and improve the environment over the long term. The new Sustainable Farm Incentive (SFI) launched in 2022 is running alongside CS. Nick grimaced “It’s a lot of forms to fill in, we absolutely have to use 3rd party consultants – everyone does”. It’s too early to tell how the Environmental Land Management schemes in general (ELM), of which CS and SFI form a part will pan out. SFI has led to some famers taking almost all of their land out of food production completely. On the day of my visit, DEFRA announced that they were belatedly capping this amount to a maximum of 25% of land – and announces this on the website “From midnight tonight” – which seems a little last minute and hasty. Food labelling is a real mess and a huge issue for farmers to see Union Flags all over bags of produce grown elsewhere. The red tractor scheme is discredited and “dead”.\nTo hear Nick talk in a field on his farm in Wroughton, the subsidy scheme seemed like a bit of a complex mess. We surely need to ensure our food security by growing food here, and farm sensitively so that we look after the environment. In the Gulf, Houthi rebels fire on merchant ships sending vessels the long way around. Ukrainian grain is flowing again but is at risk. Import inspections for agrifoods will finally commence this year with yet unknown costs for importers to the UK. We cannot and should not rely on long supply lines for food and yet this is exactly what the government seemed to be doing with the somewhat desperate trade deals with Australia, New Zealand and Canada. Improbably large US chlorinated chickens still lurk in the wings.\nMeanwhile, the UK is falling behind the EU on almost every area of environmental regulation, as the bloc strengthens its legislation while the UK weakens it. In some cases, ministers are removing EU-derived environmental protections from the statute book entirely – this too will threaten the Tariff Free trade we have under the EU/UK Trade and Co-Operation agreement.\nConclusion\nWhere next for farming? Nick is coming up for retirement. Land is finite and under pressure for building and more recently solar energy. Our population is rising, obesity is rising, food waste is rising, food banks are rising. We cannot hope to solve everything, but it strikes me we need to try and avoid more huge changes to the subsidy schemes. That we should simplify, we should ensure food production, we should make export and import to the EU frictionless – and if this means veterinary agreements and common regulations so be it. We need to think, grow and eat local. I’ve just ordered my Gold Top to be delivered on Thursday.\nI’ll write more about Ed’s business in next few weeks, but in the meantime huge thanks to Nick Gosling for his time. I’ve also spent time with a Beef Farmer near Marlborough and an organic arable farmer near Rushall – I’ll cover these shortly as well.",

This was a chance to understand more about how the Practice is set up to deliver primary healthcare and the issues that they face.\nFirst the numbers, the Practice serves a population of 17,200 people and employs 75 staff, of which just over half are clinicians. There are 11 full time GPs and one GP under training. 8 of the GPs are “Partners”. This means that they jointly own the entire practice and have full responsibility (and unlimited liability) for delivery of not just the primary healthcare, but for the staff, buildings, equipment, power, health and safety, budgeting – everything. This firmly binds the GP and an individual to his or her practice and the community it serves. General Practice has, since 1948 effectively been a “contracted out” function, with GPs being self-employed rather than salaried. It is also a dispensing practice – meaning it can dispense medication to any patient who lives more than 1 mile from a pharmacy.\nKAMP’s contract is with Bath and North-East Somerset, Swindon and Wiltshire Integrated Care Board (BSW ICB). This body can be thought of as our Local Area Health Authority – effectively contracting for our healthcare. KAMP also sits within the East Kennet Primary Care Network (EKPCN) – which brings KAMP together with GP practices at Burbage, Ramsbury & Wanborough, Great Bedwyn. The intention being to share services for patients, but this is often impractical outside of urban areas given the distances involved in patients accessing EKPCN services.\nGP Appointments and Access to a GP\nThe data shows that 25% of patients that call in to KAMP are seen on the same day, which is good, although this seem at odds with the lived experience of many patients often forcefully expressed on social media – the issue is that non-urgent face-to-face appointments with GPs can be 2 - 5 weeks away. It was clear from the visit that the success of the practice in delivering healthcare is about so much more than the GPs delivering face to face appointments – important though these are, this is not the only measure of success. The practice employs 9 nurses, 3 paramedics, 5 Health care assistants all familiar roles within a practice and becoming increasingly highly trained and specialised. As a large, modern practice, KAMP also offers a whole range of specialist roles such as a physiotherapist, clinical pharmacists, a health and wellbeing team, social prescribers, and care co-ordinators as well as a team specialising in caring for the over 75s. They can deal with a huge array of patient problems as well as routine bloods, health checks, vaccinations, and preventative screening. The practice is trying incredibly hard to break the “GP” issue – patients who demand to see a GP when they could be seen more quickly and just as successfully by one of the other clinicians on site. This effort is not helped by certain sections of the media that still position a face-to-face GP appointment as the “Gold Standard”. Even Lib Dem policy in this area seems a little flawed “Give everyone the right to see their GP within seven days, or within 24 hours if they urgently need to”, when we should probably be talking about access to the clinician we need.\nFunding\nAs it is April, funding for the next financial year has been (just) announced with an increase of just 1.9%. Given the inflation of the past year, and the recent increase of 10% in minimum wage this meagre uplift has not gone down well. The fact that it has just been announced also means that planning for the next year can only begin now – once the year has already started. The lack of ability to create any long-term plans given the lack of visibility of future financing really does hamper the operation. You could not run a business like this, and yet the practice must do exactly that. The practice employs just 2 staff to manage their entire finance, building, staffing function – and the simply cannot overspend, or go bust – the GP partners would have personal liability. Consequently, of all parts of the NHS, GP partnerships are probably amongst the most efficient.\nTraining, Recruitment and Retention of GPs\nThe practice is 2 GPs short and has had open posts for over 12 months. There are simply not enough trained GPs to go around allied to the fact that many younger GPs do not want the commitment and obligations of a Partnership. Without enough UK candidates, NHS England runs a GP International Induction Programme which has trained huge numbers of overseas students as GPs, but this does not provide an automatic Work Visa. After completing their training, these GPs either need to return overseas, or find employment with a practice that holds a skilled worker visa – this is a further demand on already stretched GP resources. The number of GPs available across England is still declining.\nThe Future\nThe partners most fervent hope is for less change and reorganisation. Some history is probably important here - Integrated care boards (ICBs) replaced clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) in the NHS in England from 1 July 2022. Bear with me! Clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) were established as part of the Health and Social Care Act in 2012 and replaced Primary Care Trusts on 1 April 2013. In turn, PCTs were established in 2001 under the Blair’s Labour Government. There has been a lot of change, and GPs and their teams want to treat patients, not to attend hundreds of meetings about yet more expensive reorganisation.\n7 day a week surgery was not popular. GP partners already put in extended hours and personal financial commitment to their 5 day a week surgery and do not have capacity or incentive to extend this. It’s odd too that Private practice is still significantly restricted under the GMS contract. Practices that opt out of the provision of additional, enhanced or out-of-hour services, cannot charge any of their registered patients for supplying a similar service privately. So even if a GP wanted to work on a Sunday – privately, they cannot unlike consultants who can (and do).\nMaking it Better\nAs ever, there are no simple solutions, but if we want shorter waiting times, we must fund primary care properly and enable Partnerships to plan with confidence. We also need to train enough GPs and related clinicians and break obvious logjams like the Visa issue. Fully staffed surgeries will in turn balance workloads and help with GP retention and we might see numbers start to rise and appointment waiting times fall. As a society we all need help ourselves with prevention and healthier lifestyles, be prepared to embrace telephone appointments and seeing other professionals other than the GP.\nFinally, a huge thanks to Dr Richard Hook, Dr Laura Freeman, and the Practice Manager Amy Lacey for their input and to Suzy Deering the Patient Services and Communications Officer for setting it all up. I know the time is precious.",

Beautiful, pale houses curve like an amphitheatre around the harbour. Not the normal Cycladic cuboids. Ermoupoli went up in the boom years between the 1820's and 1860's, when the harbour was the new nation's busiest. Neoclassical architects. A more feminine, decorative feel to the place. I'm smitten.\nI bike around the south of the island. Azolimnos. Vari. Poseidonia. Poseidonia! Great name!\nEverything very easy on the eye. By the time I get back to Ermoupoli, something has been decided. This is it. This is where I take my stand. I'll buy a place here before the UK leaves. Wave a giant two fingers to that toad Farage, and stay in the E.U. I know there will be hoops to be got through, but...... I've found it. My E.U. refuge. I shall remain part of the noblest political project in European history. Buy before the end of this year, and I'll have residency rights. I'm sorted.\nI even manage to get 2 days in, looking at houses with estate agents, before.....\nThe news from Italy about the virus epidemic starts to come in.\nMy amazing arthritis drug works by dampening my immune system right down, so that instead of attacking me, like an angry leopard, it rolls on its back and asks to have its tummy tickled, like a very gentle and weak, puppy. Which is lovely. Makes me feel a new man. But now there is an aggressive virus swarming through Europe, and I have a fluffy toy for an immune system.\nNot good. I'm booked to fly back to Gatwick in a few days.\nI e-mail my arthritis specialist. \"I'm due to have the last of my four epipen injections tomorrow. Can I risk Athens airport?\"\n\"The NHS advice is to continue treatment....\" is her advice. Those four dot dot dots: hers, not mine.\nI wander aimlessly around the streets of Ermoupoli. Busy even in winter. Go to a pharmacy. Maybe a mask would help. He sells me a mask. Tells me that's his last one. Clearly I'm not the only one who's heard the news about Italy.\nBut..... you know what... I don't need to fly back, because once I've had this last injection, (tomorrow) there is no drug left, needing to be kept at fridge temperature. I'll do that planet-saving journey I'd planned originally, but in reverse. Huzzah! Forget masks at Athens airport and on the plane. Get the ferry to Bari, and train up to Milan.................\nWhich is that night named as the epicentre of the Italian epidemic.\nSo, I don't do that.\nI have a bit of a think...... and decide that my specialist has left those four little dots as a tiny life raft. I don't take that fourth injection. I don't risk Athens (or, more lethal probably, Gatwick) airport. I get back to Antiparos as fast as I can. My apartment is booked til May 2nd. I wasn't planning to use it all that time. Not even half that time. But right now, a sleepy little island in the Cyclades seems as safe a place on Earth as I can get. My immune system, if and when it returns, will start attacking me again. Grim. However, better to be shuffling around like a very very old man, but.... alive, than face this virus with no immune system at all. My March 7th flight leaves for Gatwick, without me. Now I just have to hope that the virus takes its time getting to Antiparos.\nNow..... it's probably fair to say that at no time since 1832, have the Greek people been at the top of anybody's civil obedience league. And recently they have had a lot to be angry about. The global financial crisis of 2007-2008 impacted disastrously on Greece, leaving its people reeling for a decade. In the last few years, things have got a little better. Just a little. But if I were a German or French banker, I'd probably choose somewhere else for my summer holidays. Anywhere else.\nThe present Greek government is a Centre-Right affair, led by a seemingly mild, slightly uncharismatic character: Kyriakos Mitsotakis.\nHis party is N.D. New Demokratia. This is not Syriza ( Alexis Tsipras's left-wing party. The one that took on the European banks. For a while...) Mitsotakis has an impressive family background. He's a direct descendant of Eleftherios Venizelos, a legendary figure in Greek politics and his father, Konstantinos Mitsotakis was also Prime Minister of Greece, in the early 1990's. As he made his announcements on TV: schools must close: tavernas must close: people must stand 2 metres apart, I wished him well...... but come on, this is Greece. Never going to happen.\nOn March 10th, the Greek government closed all schools.\nOn March 13th, in Italy, 1,250 people have died of the virus.\nOn March 13th, in Greece, all tavernas and restaurants are ordered shut. Good luck with that, I thought... and wandered up to Grigori's that night. Closed. Soulatso's also closed.\nOn March 13th, in England, 11 people are known to have already died of the virus. And 200,000 people gather underneath Cleeve Hill, to watch the Cheltenham festival. Tomorrow the Stereophonics will play to 21,000 people packed into the Manchester Arena.\nBoris's herd immunity policy is full steam ahead.... he's actually aiming for the iceberg.",

The amendment would require the Home Office to give EU Citizens physical proof of Settled and Pre-Settled Status, rather than the digital-only system the Home Office is currently pursuing.\nConservatives in the House of Commons rejected the amendment by 331 votes to 260. Danny Kruger was among those voting to scrap the amendment, while Liberal Democrat MPs and MPs in all other parties voted to retain it.\nThe latest Home Office figures show that, as of the end of June,11,710 people in Wiltshire have applied to the EU Settlement Scheme for the right to stay in the UK after the Brexit transition period ends. 7,100 have been granted Settled Status so far, while a further 3,860 have been granted temporary Pre-Settled Status.\nFollowing the vote, Liberal Democrat Home Affairs Spokesperson Alistair Carmichael said:\n\"The Conservatives' decision to overturn this Liberal Democrat amendment shows how empty their promises to guarantee citizens' rights after Brexit really are. Their Hostile Environment is, sadly, alive and well.\n\"The Windrush Scandal showed the devastating impact of the Hostile Environment on people who cannot easily prove their rights. By denying EU citizens physical proof of Settled Status, the Government risks making them the victims of a new Windrush-style Scandal.\"\nJo Waltham Liberal Democrat Spokesperson for Devizes, said:\n\"EU citizens in Wiltshire are our families and friends, our colleagues and carers. They have been living under a cloud of uncertainty for far too long.\n\"By refusing to provide EU citizens with physical proof of their rights and forcing them to rely on a digital code and an online Home Office database, Danny Kruger is putting them at risk of discrimination.\n\"Liberal Democrats are fighting for EU citizens to be given the automatic right to stay in the UK, with physical proof of their status.\"",

On Monday (July 16) a meeting was held in Marlborough to discuss the consultation and to hear the views of Wiltshire councillors and parents.\nWiltshire is short of places for SEND children and there is some overcrowding in schools. It is estimated that Wiltshire will need 220 extra places by 2026.\nThe meeting was organised by Jo Waltham - a Liberal Democrat campaigner and parent of a child with special educational needs. On the panel were five Wiltshire councillors:\nTwo Conservative councillors - James Sheppard (Aldbourne & Ramsbury and the Council's Vice-Chairman) and Jane Davies (West Selkley and Portfolio holder for SEND and Safeguarding). Two Liberal Democrat councillors Ian Thorn (Calne) and Jon Hubbard (Melksham and chair of the Children's Select Committee). And Nick Fogg - Independent Councillor for Marlborough West.\nEleven members of the public attended - mostly parents of SEND children. The Councillors gave some of the background to the current pre-consultation on the future of special schools in Wiltshire and the work on the requirements by the task-group and scrutiny committee of Wiltshire Council.\nThese groups can advise but not enforce. The task group is cross-party and its deliberations are evidence based - speaking to parents and schools as part of their evidence gathering.\nProvision of special schools is a statutory requirement on councils. The main issue aired at the meeting was the complexities due to the size and low population density of the county. The discussion lasted for an hour and a half.\nSome issues have been decided: there will be extra, new provision for South Wiltshire which is relatively poorly served at present. Despite the overcrowding, there will be no new single 'super-school' to cover all designations of need.\nWiltshire Council is borrowing £30-40 million to pay for improved provision across the county.\nAnother main issue aired on Monday was travel times for SEND children to attend their schools. There are no statutory guidelines for transport times for SEND children. Department for Education advises councils that students of mainstream schools should travel for no more than 75 minutes, but SEND children may have to travel further.\nThere was some sympathy for the view that SEND children should travel less than this (say one hour) whenever possible. SEND children have particular issues with long-travel times due to anxiety and sensory processing disorder.\nOne idea that the meeting discussed was for specialist schools could take over management of student transport. This would allow better planning around specific needs and also allow school staff to be on the buses.\nThis would help drivers who, everyone agreed, have a difficult job. Travel to school could become a positive for many pupils - part of the day's education. But taking on this responsibility could only work for larger schools.\nOne way forward is to improve 'resource bases' for special needs in mainstream schools - like the one at Marlborough St Mary's Primary School. Though some heads embrace inclusivity in their schools, the costs are high and league tables discourage schools from becoming heavily involved in SEND.\nThe councillors were told that one size does not fit all. All SEND children are different and need tailored provision. Flexible approaches are needed. Children with complex needs cannot be catered for in resource bases.\nIt was said that reducing the number of special schools also reduces choice, increases travel times and encourages parents to take-up expensive, out of county provision (which already costs the county £11 million per year). Some children with complex needs require a small-school environment.\nRowdeford School, near Rowde, which was thought to be threatened with closure in May, is centrally placed, has a beautiful environment, supportive neighbours and room to expand. However, it also has planning problems due to flood risk, being in an area of outstanding natural beauty and having a listed main building. Expansion of Rowdeford was said to be a possibility.\nThe consultation is evidence based, but the meeting heard that this inevitably means it is focussed on provision that can cater for the majority and has problems with discussing specific, tricky cases. It is accepted that doing nothing is not an option as existing schools are overcrowded.\nThe consultation form has been changed to allow parents to add more of their own words in responding to the final question and people can complete the form a second time.\nThe results of this consultation will go back to the Council's cabinet - and a formal consultation will be needed on cabinet's specific proposals.\nThe consultation can be found here: http://wiltshire.objective.co.uk/portal/education/special_school_provision_in_wiltshire",

The idea is that young people have their own space in an area that has been agreed by the community. Youngsters hanging around bus stops and convenience shops can be intimidating for many people. We want to work with local people to see if a youth shelter would work in Devizes.\nThe structures have relatively open sides so they are not 'hidey holes'. They also tend to have sloping seats to deter rough-sleepers. Some residents might day \"we never had that kind of thing in our day\" but times change. We have a different society now with different issues - and disaffected youth is one of those issues.\nSo, what are the benefits? The young people get a place to go and meet which is non-confrontational. If it has a sport facility associated with it then there's more to do. The benefits for the wider community can include less vandalism, less graffiti, lower maintenance costs and reduced fear of crime.

This includes me of course. Although delighted that we have 72 Lib Dem MPs in Parliament today, I hoped we could make this change happen here too.\nIn fact in East Wiltshire, 29,000 people did not vote for the winning candidate, with another 27,000 that didn't vote at all. This feels fundamentally wrong.\nAs I drove to the count I really could not predict the outcome at all, although I knew Reform would be significant, I could not work out the likely Lib Dem/Con/Labour split.\nThe calculated \"notional vote\" from 2019 with the new boundaries placed Labour narrowly second (by just a few hundred votes), and in turn this led to tactical voting recommendations for Labour, set alongside Labour's strong national polling. This tactical voting recommendation was set against recent local election results favouring the Lib Dems. We ran an excellent upbeat campaign which aimed to engage voters across this huge new constituency and we absolutely succeeded in this, but ultimately we could not counter the tactical vote recommendations, and neither could Labour capitalise on them.\nThe Lib Dem policy platform is bolder than Labour, braver than Labour. It is honest about dealing head on with the biggest issues we face. The need to invest more in our health and social care service and the need to be honest about the need to fix our deal with Europe, with nothing ruled out.

We were all of us live-in carers for my mother well into her 90s. All I have ever done is to listen to the amazing women in my life. It therefore shocked us all when back in 2022, our MP, Tory Danny Kruger said in a debate on abortion that women do not have 'Absolute Right of Bodily Autonomy'. He went on to say that MPs should not be \"lecturing\" United States over the Supreme Court's decision to remove rights to abortion. The women in my life were furious. They saw this as a healthcare right, something that should be fundamental, and here was our male MP throwing shade and doubt on this– seemingly based on his own religious beliefs. He then claimed our reaction was overblown and that Devizes, Marlborough and the nation at large had all misunderstood. Pure gaslight.\nBut Danny Kruger has also helpfully written a book (Covenant, the New Politics of Home Neighbourhood and Nation) where we find out more about what he really thinks. He argues that the purpose of politics is the “cultivation of the conditions of virtue” and quoting John Milbank “that the right way to be human…is when we conform to some fairly traditional habits”. He goes on “We also believe that traditional habits are the best and only proper ground for freedom, tolerance…that the yearning for a more just, more free, more meaningful and moral society is a yearning for the past.” He nails this together with\n“To make marriage what it should be – an equal enduring partnership – we have to acknowledge that its purpose is the regulation, the right ordering of sexual relations; that in theory at least, and certainly according to the messages we should give our children, marriage is the safest and best place for sex.”\nSex, for Danny is a matter of Conservative and public concern that should always be back behind closed doors and solely in marriage. Both parents should not work, but if they do it should be part time. He just about forgives same-sex marriages, and single parents – but you can hear the grit in his teeth.\nHe variously explores his opposition to the Equality Act, the ECHR, his deference to the past, the promotion of patriotism, the importance of grammar, and that too many people have left home and gone to university.\nDanny is another traditionalist looking backwards for answers. I am looking forwards. I want to make things only better and fairer. We have gone so far in making so many things better for the oppressed, the dispossessed, the marginalised, the forgotten. We have imperfectly sought to give equality, balance and fairness to race, gender cultures and identities. Not without getting things wrong on the way but progress all the same. As a liberal, I always seek to emphasise the struggle for freedom of the individual – all women, all men, all humans, and look to consign Danny Kruger’s views to the history books they came from.",

The Stern Report, praised by Mr Brown last year when it was published, is now gathering dust. The call for action is not being taken seriously by the Prime Minister or the Labour government.\n\"The situation however could have been much different.

They call it \"flow trimming.\" By diverting sewage away from treatment plants, they save money, but our rivers suffer. Like VW’s “defeat” software to mask diesel engine emissions – it’s easier to fake good performance than actually deliver it.\nThis scheme benefits shareholders, over 70% of which are foreign entities. Since privatisation, these shareholders who have pocketed £78bn in dividends , whilst the industry has amassed £64bn of debt.\nPublic service providers like Thames Water are too big to fail, so the government bails them out, leaving taxpayers with the risk. Meanwhile, the regulatory system that is supposed to keep our rivers clean is totally ineffective, with enforcement agencies like the Environment Agency understaffed and underfunded.\nOur rivers are now dumping grounds for sewage and political failures. Successive Conservative and Labour Governments have failed to force these companies to serve the public. Richard Murphy states that the Water Companies are “environmentally insolvent” – that they will never be able to fund the investment we need to deliver clean water from our taps and into our rivers.\nIn 2021, Danny Kruger voted down an amendment to the Environment Bill that sought and outright ban on water companies discharging sewage. He has since been seeking to tinker with Ofwat – using fines for environmental remediation, seeking changes to the Strategic Policy Statement. It is only this year – that the Environment Agency has been given a promised boost in funding to better police the water companies.\nThe outcome since Danny Kruger, and many other Conservatives voted not to ban sewage in 2021 is that sewage has continued to be dumped unabated into our chalk streams. Perhaps a simple ban might have been easier to understand than the ineffectual changes that have applied.\nIn November 1989 PM Margaret Thatcher replied in PMQs that “water privatisation I believe will go very successfully indeed. And perhaps therefore we had better wait and see so that we can pontificate in the light of the facts.” Well - we can now pontificate and agree that from the perspective of the public and the environment it has comprehensively failed. We can no longer tinker, we have to be bold and consider public ownership, or as the Lib Dems have suggested public benefit companies. Now.",

The photos above show a much younger Captain David Kinnaird in Bulford prior to deployment on Op Resolute in Bosnia, and on my previous posting in Cyprus.\nI joined the Army in January1987. Unlike most of my fellow cadets at Sandhurst I had been to a state school and had no other family connections to the military. I joined the Army as I discovered I was colour blind and would never be a pilot. A kindly recruiting sergeant watched me walk crestfallen from the RAF recruiter, shepherded me into his shiny office and showed me photos of soldiers water skiing in Belize. Simple as that, I was in.\nThe Army I joined was nearly 150,000 strong. We had 3 full Armoured Divisions based in the North of West Germany, and as young officer in the Royal Signals I served in 2 of them at 4 Division (briefly) and then a full tour with the Headquarters and Signal Regiment of the 3rd (Iron) Division. This was before the fall of the Berlin Wall, and we exercised and prepared for all-out war with the USSR and Warsaw Pact. Our \"Active Edge\" kit was permanently packed, and we were ready to deploy to our pre-prepared positions. This was the UK in NATO, prepared to face and defeat what Ukraine is facing now. I served subsequently in Colchester, Catterick, Cyprus, Bulford, Bosnia, Staff College and the MoD leaving the service aged 36 as a Major.\nThe 1987 Army ran its own recruiting, guarded its own camps, owned its quarters accommodation, serviced its own vehicles, had Army cooks, doctors, medics, vets, chaplains both in camp and on exercise, and at war. Indeed, it had its own forces hospitals (one was just up the road in Wroughton). It was a self-sufficient eco-system that could look after itself and its people (including dependents) in almost every respect.\nSlowly, the Army has been outsourced. Catering in barracks and in messes is now by Sodexo (amongst others). All Married Quarters were sold off by the Tories in 1996 to Annington Homes, a deal so bad that 28 years later the MoD are trying to reverse it. Many vehicles are maintained by civilians, often not by the soldiers that would operate them in battle. Recruiting was outsourced to Capita in 2012 – a disaster that has simply not recruited the number of soldiers the Army requires. Last year, with a 3,000 net outflow, the CGS - Patrick Sanders despatched hundreds of soldiers to help recruit other soldiers. We now have 75,000 soldiers - nearly 10% less than we should have.\nIt seems to me looking back and in, that the Army's capacity to recruit, sustain and nurture its people within an embracing and cohesive culture has been damaged. Outsourced slice by outsourced slice. When I visited Tidworth Garrison recently it was understandably quiet, with many soldiers committed to many different countries and a huge NATO exercise ongoing. But so many soldiers now serve unaccompanied, leaving partners back in their hometown - and even when not deployed, this is where they return at weekends, leaving the Garrison a ghost town. \"\"People treat it just like a job now\", one officer commented \"warfighting capability remains outstanding, but there has been fundamental change in the Army way-of-life\"\nMost serving soldiers knew that selling off the quarters in 1996 was a terrible idea. Most also knew that outsourcing recruiting and training was also a terrible idea. Uniformed jobs in recruiting and training for long serving soldiers kept experience and ties within the Army. The whole system had resilience and depth. It worked. When I left the Army, my resignation letter stated that the Military Covenant was even then not being upheld. It seems much worse now. The basic need for decent accommodation is still not being universally delivered.\nI think we need to revisit the dogma that has led to so much being outsourced. Both Labour and the Conservatives have driven this and I believe have ultimately damaged the culture of the Army. Recruiting, and the factors that help with retention need to be in control of the chain of command, not a lawyer with a contract. In the meantime, the contracts we have need to be properly enforced and made to work as designed. Big commitments on spending will not work unless we recruit, train and retain the service personnel we need.\nOur defence is critical, so no more terrible ideas that slice away capability and ethos would be a good move. A top down approach that has driven outsourcing has negatively impacted the Army, and the same can be seen happening across the NHS and care sector. Old soldiers can bore on for hours about how \"it wasn't like this in my day\" so apologies for that - but it is really clear that we are outsourcing away some of what made service life special. It is more than just a job, and it needs to feel like that. From the moment you first think of joining you need to be special, looked after and valued. Capita delays and mouldy accommodation just will not cut it.",

A local group – the East Wilts Primaries, did set out to do exactly that by encouraging all candidates to take part in a moderated hustings, followed by a vote – which would have led to a local “people’s champion” – the lead progressive anti-Tory candidate.\nI was personally very happy to take part in these and had engaged with the East Wilts Primary team as soon as I was selected. As the first primary took place in Devon, the regional party and then the national party began to hear about it and it was quickly decided that Lib Dem Prospective Candidates could take no further part in any Primary Activity. We all received notice that we would be deselected if we failed to comply. The Labour party had independently come to the same view.\nThe reasons are twofold:\n1. A candidate's campaign is important. Engagement, leaflets, canvassing, PR, fundraising are the hard slog of a campaign. The more you do, the more votes you generally get. All of this is entirely under the candidate’s control and the process ends then with an official, regulated public vote. At a Primary husting, the attendance, voting mechanism and conduct would be entirely out of the candidate's control. The detail of the hustings had not been worked out by the Primary Team. If one of the other progressive parties sought to flood the \"primary\" with activists and members - the primary vote could be swung regardless of the actual performance of the other candidates. There is also potential for a candidate to have an \"off night\"! Given the weight that might be given to the Primary outcome, an entire campaign, months or work, money and volunteer work could be undone by a prejudicial 3rd party event, or a freakishly poor one night performance. Of course, normal local hustings don't have a \"vote\" at the end of them.\n2. Funding and Election rules. The Lib Dem national Party were not satisfied that PPERA rules could be observed with the potential costs of running the primary events and any subsequent activities undertaken by the Primary team in support of the \"People's Choice\"\nI hope this makes sense. We are working hard to make sure that we are the default choice for people wishing to cast their vote for a progressive party. As far as I can tell East Wilts Labour party has done practically nothing at all locally yet - we obviously won Marlborough Town Council election - with a 62% vote share over the Tories. Only a Town council yes - but in Marlborough, that's something. Note also that we have won that last 4 Amesbury Town Council elections - again up against the Tories.\nIn both Wroughton and Ridgeway wards and in the PCC Elections on 2nd May – Lib Dem Candidates came in front of Labour (PCC for Wiltshire). In Wroughton – our vote share was nearly double that of Labour. I take greater store by votes actually cast in Wiltshire than by polling that is undertaken outside it.",

Sixty years ago, at the end of the 2nd World War, most foods were rationed.\n\"An adult was entitled to 200 grams of sugar, 100 grams of preserves, 200 grams of fats, 50 grams of cheese, 100 grams of bacon and 50 grams of tea a week. The total weight was 700 grams though that excludes 2 other products that were rationed but not weighed - one egg and 2 pints of milk a week.\n\"In a year, basic weighed rations were 36kg. That means we now throw away more than twice the basic rations people survived on sixty years ago.\n\"WRAP has found that nine out of ten people are currently not aware of the quantity of food they throw out but when it is brought to their attention, most want to do something about it.\n\"There are some basic ways to avoid food waste which WRAP recommend people adopt. For example, work out what food you need and write a shopping list, rather than making choices when going around the supermarket. People can also make more use of their fridge, freezer or air tight boxes rather than leaving food out in the open where it goes off quicker.\n\"Residents in the Devizes area spend £133 each on food that is thrown away each year. That's £133 each of us throws into a landfill site.\n\"The amount of waste people produce is a growing problem. It costs council tax payer a large amount to collect and then dispose of the waste. And in landfill sites, waste food rots and gives off methane, a strong greenhouse gas that is causing global warming.\n\"We each have to play our part in protecting the environment. By avoiding wasting food, we can save money as well!\"\nLocal Liberal Democrats are encouraging residents of the Devizes area to visit http://www.lovefoodhatewaste.com/ for handy tips on saving money and avoiding waste.",

It sounds like an unsympathetic insurance company wriggling out of a claim but I'm prepared to give him the benefit of the doubt because the real issue, for me, is that appearances do matter. And we'll be able to tell in about a week's time whether I'm right.\nWhen \"government scientist\", Neil Ferguson, and Scotland's chief medical officer, Catherine Calderwood were exposed for flouting lockdown regulations they immediately understood the implications. They're scientists and it was obvious to them that, even if their actions only changed the behaviour of a small percentage of people by a very small amount, this would lead to real additional deaths of real additional people. The only way to avoid this was to step down without delay and without self-justification. So that is what they did. The graph above demonstrates that their actions did the trick!\nSo, what are you looking at? The graph shows the total number of people hospitalized in the UK by Covid-19 and how this has changed over the last few months. The data is taken from the UK government and is shown, here, as black circles. Each of the three, roughly straight, sections corresponds to an approximately constant \"R-value\". Upward slopes correspond to R bigger than one and downward slopes correspond to R less than one. So what we're seeing here is changes to R as a result of changes in all our behaviour.\nInitially, there was a rapid rise in hospital bed usage (indicated by the red line) but, from about the 5th of April, this flattened considerably (see the green line). This was probably the result of the lockdown which came in on March 23rd. We'd expect a delay between lockdown and hospital admissions simply because it takes time to go from being infected to being sick enough to need a hospital bed. If the slow-down after April 5th was indeed the result of the lockdown then the implication is that the delay is about 13 days.\nBut what about that very significant change, from hospital-admission growth to hospital-admission decline, after about April 12th? What happened 13 days before that? What happened around March 30th?\nIt may be a Boris Johnson effect. We heard that our Prime Minister had tested positive for corona-virus on March 27th and, by the end of the month, it was pretty clear that he was not at all well. Did this shock the nation into taking lockdown more seriously? If it did, then Boris Johnson's unfortunate illness, and his decision to immediately make it public, may have saved thousands of lives.\nSo what about Catherine Calderwood and Neil Ferguson? Their stories broke around April 4th and May 5th respectively and 13 days from those dates gets you to April 17th and May 18th. There is no convincing evidence of changes in my graph around those dates. Small fluctuations perhaps but nothing I would consider statistically meaningful. This is why I think their prompt action, in stepping down, was effective.\nThat, finally, brings me back to Dominic Cummings. Accusations that he flouted the rules were first made a week ago and so we'd expect any effect to show up on the graph in about a week's time. It may take a few further days after that for any change in trend to be undeniable but I'll be looking very closely. In fact, I'm going to stick my neck out and make a prediction, today on May 30th, that we will see an increase in hospital-bed usage starting around June 6th. If we do, then Dominic Cummings is wrong to believe that appearances don't matter.\nI really hope it's me that's wrong though. I really hope that there is no increase in hospitalizations or in fatalities. However, any such happy outcome will be because the British people were selfless and intelligent enough to continue sticking to the rules despite the poor example from the top.\nAbout the author\nDavid Waltham is Professor of Geophysics at Royal Holloway, University of London where he has spent the last 35 years undertaking mathematical analysis and mathematical modelling of complex geological and geophysical data.

As Chancellor, Gordon Brown has allowed the tax burden to go up on those with the lowest incomes.\n\"He has given us the massively complicated tax credits system that is riddled with errors. Here in the Devizes Constituency £2.9 million was overpaid to residents in the last financial year which the Treasury then demanded back.\n\"Yet at the same time, the tax credit system is a disincentive to people on benefits to work. Our proposals to tackle poverty will ensure there is a greater incentive to work and save for retirement.\n\"By scrapping council tax and lowering the rate of income tax, we will ensure that when people come off benefits and start work, less of their hard earned money is taken from them by the government.\n\"Furthermore, the additional £5 a week for all families with children will be a significant helping hand to many people living in the Devizes Constituency\n\"Our proposals for additional funding for children from the most deprived areas going straight to their schools will give them a better start in life. With a better education, they are less likely to become dependent on benefits in later life.\n\"Council tax falls most heavily on those on low incomes and I am delighted to see that the Liberal Democrats are calling for it to be scrapped and replaced by a fairer local income tax, based on ability to pay.\n\"As a campaigner in Devizes I meet many elderly people and I have seen how their income and standard of living of a large number of our senior citizens has fallen behind that of the rest of the population.\n\"So I fully support the proposal to link immediately the basic state pension to the average rise in pay.\n\"In a wealthy country such as Britain, we should not have such a huge gap between rich and poor as we have now under Labour.\n\"Our plans will go a long way to closing the poverty gap by giving people a real incentive to work. They will end some of the penalties imposed on people who have saved for their retirement.\n\"The proposals will be debated at our national conference in September and I am looking forward to voting for them.\"",

Gordon Brown had the power to call it and for a while he was ready to do so because he thought it was in the interest of his own party to do so.\n\"But he pulled back from firing the starting pistol only because he realised he would probably lose the election.\n\"The people should not be treated in this way. The Prime Minister should not have this huge amount of power to make decisions in his or her party's political interest rather than the national interest.\n\"Liberal Democrats in Devizes strongly believe that each Parliament should last four years. The date of the general election should be set in law rather than by the Prime Minister.\n\"This is the case for elections to the Scottish Parliament and Welsh National Assembly. It should be the case for the UK Parliament as well. So I am pleased that Liberal Democrats MPs are pressing for this improvement.\n\"I am disappointed however that though government ministers have announced some constitutional changes recently, they are suggesting only the smallest of changes to the right to call an election. The government are proposing that the House of Commons should have the power to decide whether or not to call an election.\n\"That will mean that the ruling party, under the leadership of the Prime Minister, will have the opportunity to call an election when it is in their self interest to do so.\n\"Liberal Democrat MP David Howarth has proposed a new law calling for fixed term Parliaments. We are calling on the Conservative MP for Devizes to support this necessary change to avoid a repeat of the chaos residents witnessed earlier in October.\"",

Probably other things too, but mainly that one, because.... well, because I'm an actor. I'm known as Aden Gillett when I swan about the stage, but John the Actor when I swan about The Blue Boar or Crown in Aldbourne.\nThis is an account of being stuck in a strange hostile country, very different from the one I've been familiar with all these years...........

A well trained Labrador would be elected here, as long as he wore a blue collar. So, I travel to Winchester. Try and help Paula Ferguson over the line.

Elections.\nBut today....... black skies. Monsoon rain. Mobile phone sodden, useless, after 5 or 6 hours. No way to get voting information back to Lib Dem H.Q. Lib Dem H.Q. know anyway.

  "https_www_eastwiltslibdems_org_uk_/https_www_eastwiltslibdems_org_uk_news_article_the-growth-agenda/content_13.html": "The Growth Agenda\nThe Growth Agenda\nUpdated 15 Feb 24 - the UK is now officially in recession\nEveryone wants the economy to grow. We want more people employed in well paid jobs in profitable enterprises that in turn deliver the tax revenues we need to fund the welfare state and high-quality public services. We hope this will make our people happier, healthier and more content. We hope that in turn society will become fairer, with more opportunities for all – levelling up as someone once said. And any growth needs to happen whilst committing to Net Zero and proactively decarbonising our economy.\nPrivate enterprise is the principal engine of growth and prosperity for the people of the UK, but business can only succeed within an efficient economic framework provided by Government. A skilled and healthy workforce, efficient transport, coherent and predictable legislation, and easy access to markets are on the Government’s side of the growth equation.\nIn every part of this the Conservatives have failed in their role. Huge numbers of people have left the UK workforce as they are simply too unwell to work, with nearly 8 million people on the NHS waiting list. Our railways are the most expensive and most unreliable in Europe, our crumbling roads are full, making journeys unpredictable and costly. Our energy supply is fragile and expensive. Brexit has caused higher export and logistic costs with few upsides so far. The Tories took back control but immediately drove us into a wall.\nWe are in a mess and there is no simple solution. But there are 2 broad missions that we can take on to further the growth agenda: (1) Increase Investment and Productivity; and, (2) Reduce Economic Friction.\nInvestment and Productivity\nKey to growth (and our overall prosperity) for the country is increased investment to increase efficiency and productivity. The Tories bemoan the UK’s low levels of productivity and seek to blame workers for an inherent laziness and employers for lack of investment appetite. But they have forgotten the maxim that uncertainty stops investment. When a domestic or international business chooses to invest in the UK they are looking for a predictable and stable regulatory environment, access to skilled people, speedy transport and logistics; and easy and consistent access to goods, services and markets. Over the last decade, none of these factors have improved, indeed in some areas they have become notably worse. Consequently, investment into the UK since 2016 has significantly underperformed the upwards trend establlished prior to then.\nRegulatory Uncertainty\nThe Tories have created the perfect environment for supressing investment. Leaving the EU increased regulatory uncertainty and whilst we have a tariff free trade deal, the “non-tariff barriers” add significant cost and delay for exporters. This year sees the first UK checks done on importers, adding similar costs to exporters from the EU into the UK. We have introduced and then dropped the UK CA mark for goods, we were set to drop the thousands of retained EU regulations on a single date (a move even Sunak recognised as catastrophic). Our exporters struggle to keep track of changing EU law as we gradually diverge from the EU’s evolving regulatory framework. The impact on investment from Brexit can be seen below as from the Referendum onwards the UK became a less predictable, stable place to do business.\nConfidence\nAllied to the regulatory environment is the degree to which we can be trusted. It seems you cannot keep threatening to renege on international agreements and treaties without consequence. When confidence goes – so does investment. In the Sep 22 Truss/Kwarteng mini budget, Truss deliberately sidelined what she referred to as “Treasury orthodoxy” the key institutions – HM Treasury, the OBR and the Bank of England. The markets were spooked. Sterling crashed and the UK instantly became a riskier and more expensive investment. It showed that if the Government breaks with expected standards of scrutiny and evidence-based policy-making, then you (and we) will be quickly found out. There was and is, always a limit on absolute Sovereignty based on the environment in which you seek to exercise it.\nPublic Sector Investment\nWhen compared internationally UK public investment is low. It has averaged 2.5 per cent of GDP for this century (against 3.7% for our OECD peers) and we can see the impact of this crumbling around us. Public Sector capital investment was much higher at 4.5% of GDP between 1949 and 1978 but this then declined as we privatised much of our public infrastructure services and stopped building houses. But the privatised utilities and transport providers have not stepped up at all, or have invested expensively through debt. Where private monopolies can deliver return to shareholders without significant capital investment there is no incentive to invest. Only regulation can compel investment and if this is weak, we end up with poor and expensive infrastructure. We have the most expensive rail and power in Europe and the most polluted rivers. We need to regulate more effectively, or even consider the previously unthinkable and return some of these failed privatisations to public ownership. Even in the areas that the Government can directly invest, the austerity programme has dampened investment leading to crumbling schools, hospitals, courts, roads, bridges, leisure centres; fewer MRI machines, and insufficient social housing. The Palace of Westminster itself is a leaking, poorly maintained metaphor for itself.\nEconomic Friction\nOur economy has had sand poured into its engine. Nothing is as easy and friction free as it once was. Some if this is due to the poor state of our national infrastructure, but much has come about due to our changed relationship with the EU.\nThe Remain campaign painted an apocalyptic future outside the EU that was breezily and easily dismissed as “Project Fear”. These overblown predictions of disaster did not come to pass on the day after the Referendum, or on 30 Jan 2020. It has therefore been easy to downplay the impact of leaving the EU as not as bad as Project Fear, and this narrative persists. This Conservative Government, trapped by their own dogma cannot allow introspection and an honest evaluation of what is now worse, and what is now better. In their world, and that of much of the right-wing media, this lack of outright disaster is somehow portrayed as an unalloyed success.\nBureaucracy\nEvery exporter now has more paperwork to deal with, and whilst many have got good at this, it still slows up exports, adds costs and makes us less competitive. Musicians grapple with carnets and declarations at every border. Shellfish perish waiting for paperwork to clear. More trucks travel empty or sit idling for hours creating tonnes of additional CO2 and pollution. Extra stock and materiel has to be held and housed rather than delivered just in time. Complex rules of origin regulations means that goods imported to the UK, finished and then exported to the EU can attract an export tariff. And all of this will shortly be happening to exporters from the EU to the UK as we belatedly impose our own import checks. These are the Non-Tariff barriers that Johnson explicitly said did not exist within his deal (qv, a lie).\nHuman Capital\nPerhaps the biggest issue caused by the departure from the EU was the sudden impact on labour supply. Until we have invested in the skills we need in the UK we will always need to import skills from abroad. Locked-down-released EU workers went home during the pandemic and were unable to legally return after we had left the EU. Many sectors have subsequently had well publicised shortages. Baristas, chefs, bar staff, lorry drivers, abattoirs workers, seasonal farm workers, social and care staff, nurses; and this is not an exhaustive list. Some estimates suggest that there is a 300,000 EU related labour shortfall. Each of these has resulted in an amendment to the visa scheme as the Government has reactively pulled levers to try to plug the gaps. Simple mutual free movement with the EU has gone, which self-regulated with supply and demand. Where recruiting from further afield, the work migrant is often accompanied by dependants and will be looking at the UK for a longer period. Employers also suffer eye watering Visa and recruitment costs. This is the fundamental difference between mobility of labour, and employment-based immigration. The former is flexible, market driven and short term, the latter is expensive, quota drive, inflexible and long term and has perversely increased net migration.\nA Vision for the Future\nWe need the grown-ups in charge of the UK again. People that understand how business, data and commerce actually works. Honest people with the interests of the people that live here at heart. Not ideologues with a book deal, think tank funding and a Global Britain poster in their playroom. We need to understand that the economy will not grow without investment to drive productivity. We need to understand Sovereignty in the real world and that this will mean pooling this again inside or alongside the EU.\nInvestment will come once we are again a rational, stable, predictable normal country. It will also come when the infrastructure on which the economy relies improves dramatically which means a step change in Public Sector Investment. Imagine the impact on our cities and if we had cheap fast reliable trains, the reduction in days lost if we could see a doctor or dentist quickly, the impact on education if every child had a laptop and broadband, the benefit and pleasure we would gain from clean rivers and beaches. The busted austerity argument is that we need a good economy before we can have good healthcare, infrastructure and education. The investment argument is that we will never have a good economy until we have good healthcare, infrastructure, education. It is surely time to try the latter.",

(Part 4)\nLOCKDOWN.\nMarch 16th: all non-essential shops in Greece are closed.\nAntiparos is about half the size of Guernsey, with less than a 60th of Guernsey's population. It's probably quiet anyway at this time of year. But now: you can hear your blood go round. It's rare for me to see anyone on my long walks around the northern headland.\nSpring.\nWild scents in the air. Flowers I don't recognise. How on earth, did I wind up here? It's beautiful, isn't it? Is it? Yes. It's beautiful. A stark arid beauty.\nEverything is unfamiliar and uncertain. But not as unfamiliar and uncertain as England has become. This is going to be your country now. Get used to it.\nYou never know, you might even enjoy it.\nWalk on.......\nSometime during this week, the 5 minute ferry journey over to Paros becomes problematic. You have to have a good reason to be on it.\nAnd on March 23rd, we go into lockdown.\nYou can't leave your house unless you've texted beforehand, explaining the reason. Shopping or exercise, or emergency. €150 fine, on the spot, if you break that rule. John, a Scot who's been on Antiparos for 30 years, gets stopped in the street. No passport on him. Policeman knows him well. Sorry John: €150 fine. Tells John that he's the eighth person in Antiparos to be fined that morning.\nEarly on March 24th, as luck would have it......\nI get a call at 09.40. Mr John, we have a parcel for you. The post from Paros comes over on the 09.30 ferry, and you walk down to the harbour to pick it up.\nI dutifully write \"2\" ( which means \" shopping\" ) then write \"John Gillett\". Then \"Antiparos\". And text this to a Greek number. Then go to get my parcel.\n5 or 6 Greek guys are standing in line behind the post van. Standing close together. Greek close. Italian close. Social distancing an alien concept. I settle in line, a good five metres behind the last guy, and a police car immediately drives towards me. Policeman gestures for passport. I have it. Mobile with sent text on it? I show it. The locals in front continue to fondle each other. The policeman looks at me like I caused the 2007-8 financial crash single-handedly, but...... lets me go. It's day 2 of lockdown, not even 10 a.m. These guys are not mucking about.\nYou could also write a signed note. Reason you're out, signature, time of day you left home. I decided to text and write. Every time.\nIt says at the top Jab 2, which would have been my second arthritis jab, if I'd got my next 4 epipens in England. But now: no Jab 2 can be jabbed. The circled numbers are alcohol free days. As rare as red squirrels, as rare as tall fair skinned locals in Antiparos, as rare as a calm rational intelligent Brexit voter in Devizes. And even harder to come by, in lockdown.\nI'll spare you my day to day. It's been like yours, but warmer, and with many more online teach yourself Greek lessons. Also no T.V. or radio, or computer, or partner/ family. But I do have my mobile and a Tablet and a Kindle. And a certain amount of internet per month. I've had Zoom chats with my son and daughter and various friends. Terry Waite chained to a radiator for 4 years, it has not been.\nAs we moved towards May, the Greek government's ban on swimming became a little frustrating, but I never saw anyone flout the rule. Hard with these bays calling to you like Sirens....\nIt's the middle of May.\n2 weeks ago, the ban on swimming was lifted.\nA week ago, some clothes shops opened up.\nI got bullied into attending socially distanced beach yoga on this beach 3 times last week. With a swim afterwards to cool off. Hellish, but you force yourself, you know. If only to be sociable.\nWe still can't get over to Paros. Nor can anyone from there, get over here. Tavernas and restaurants are still closed. I haven't seen a police car for a few weeks but I believe it's still here.\nGod knows what will happen to the Greek economy, which is so reliant on tourism. Shops are being painted. Bars stocked. But it's not clear when or even if, the first tourists will arrive? Presumably some Greek mainlanders will venture over in the next 3 weeks, but after them.......?\nThe Greek Easter is like the U.K. Christmas. At this time in particular, you could sense the great sadness, frustration and anger that lockdown sometimes made people feel, and there have been outbreaks of the virus in the refugee camps, just as everybody feared there would be, but.........\nSomebody did something right, because as of today May 19th 2020, with a population of over 10 million, 3 million of whom are packed together in Athens, there have been 165 coronavirus deaths in Greece.\nThe U.K. figure, without care home deaths added, is 34,796 coronavirus deaths. The true figure will be nearly, or over, 50,000 when the government troubles itself to add the care home deaths. But for now, let's go easy on Boris and Cummings and say that their Get Coronavirus Done policy has so far, left the U.K. with 34,796 deaths, and Kiriakos Mitsotakis's early ban on social gatherings has left Greece with 165 deaths.\nI have Facebook friends who think criticism of Boris's handling of the crisis has been grossly unfair: a liberal conspiracy. So, I'll just repeat:\nOn May 19th 2020 .\nU.K. Coronavirus deaths - 34,796.\nGreece Coronavirus deaths - 165.\nThe Britain that the Cummings/Johnson/Gove triumvirate is creating, is not one I want to have any part of. They have driven me out of my own country but we newt counters, bat watchers, eco weirdies, well.... even driven into exile, we do insist on fairness, on aiming for the truth. I want to be fair. And even when dealing with a liar, I'd like to be honest. This story is not finished. It may be that the warmer Greek weather played a part here. Or some freak Hellenic coronavirus resistant gene came into play. It may be that, as an eminent Swedish epidemiologist insists, your country gets this virus now, or in the future. Johnson's herd immunity programme could be vindicated in the long run. Things may seem fine now N.Z. Australia, Greece et al., but watch out, because this virus will get into your country eventually.... Maybe. I very much hope not, but maybe.........\nHowever, if a vaccine or cure is found later this year, or early next year, how will the U.K. people feel about Boris then? Whose government would you rather have been living with: that lovable tousled haired progenitor of.... 5, 6, or 7, who makes you laugh, and thinks Trump's got the right idea, or that rather bland, uncharismatic Mr Mitsotakis?\nPS July 8th 2020\nSyros.\nLast week my Antiparos rental finally came to an end. I'd planned to be there for 4 weeks. Maybe 5 weeks. Nearly 6 months later, I've extended and extended, but the tourists are coming in now, and an Antiparos landlord must make hay while the sun shines. Time to go.\nRenting in Ermoupoli. Have had an offer accepted on a house in Poseidonia. Hoops to be got through, as I correctly predicted. But, by the end of this year, I shall have bought my EU home, and will, touch wood, be back in the EU. Yes sir!\nI watched the Stay Alert speech.\n\"How could any foreign government take this mob seriously?\", was suddenly a very serious question. Rather than a bitch in the pub. If he tanks sterling, and I think he will, I won't have the money to escape Brexit Britain.\nI transfer as much sterling as I can lay my hands on, into euros. The next day.\nI watch the Barnard Castle eye test debacle.\nI watch the scenes from Bournemouth. Greeks on Syros amazed and appalled at the footage. Crazy English!\nI watch Stanley Johnson explain how vital it is that he wend his way into Greece via Bulgaria, to prepare his Greek rental for the summer. He knows that the Greek government don't want UK visitors here yet. Not until Covid has eased off. But the Prime Minister's father's £2000 a week, summer bonanza, is at stake. Vital. Uk Covid deaths: official figure: 44,391 (In truth more likely 60,000.... and counting) Greece Covid deaths: official figure: 193. No wonder Stanley wanted to get over here.\nIt is, as many friends have texted me to say, a shitshow.\nGod help Britain.\nAnd on a personal note, God bless Antiparos.\nA friend texted yesterday: the Covid death toll in my Wiltshire village, Aldbourne, is believed to be 20. In a village of 2000 people.\nIf I hadn't gone to Antiparos, it would almost certainly be 21. I would have stayed on that drug, had no immune system and...... bye bye Johnny. So yes, the gods bless Antiparos!\nA recent blood test tells me I have an immune system again, but my specialist agrees: best stay in Greece until the UK recovers. From the virus.\nAnd from Boris.\nMe in Poseidonia Bay.\nAnd below, some music from and about Syros.",

On the quality of our education, the quality of our healthcare, how well we look after our elderly and infirm, the quality of our air, of our sparkling rivers, our clean beaches, of the opportunity we give our youth, our amazing trains and road. Pride not in the flag, but in what the flag represents for the people that live here.\nWhen I lived in the US, I was hugely proud to explain to disbelieving US colleagues that our NHS really is free – and this means cancer care, stroke care, cardiac care, emergency care. These are life events that in the US can lead the uninsured to bankruptcy and terrible outcomes.\nAs it was 2016, I also had to explain Brexit and the EU. 27 nations that had been so committed to trade, peace and the welfare of their people that they had agreed to a set of common rules and standards so that they could freely trade and exchange labour, goods and services. The use of common rules has underpinned trade, and whilst we may not agree with all of them, and although imperfect, they are designed to help to stop the powerful exploiting the weak. Trade and rules, to replace conflict and war, and it worked.\n8 years after the referendum, Brexit remains an emotional issue and perhaps this is why it is a topic avoided by both Labour and the Conservatives. I think we should try and strip away our feelings about it and deal with it in fact, with objectivity. Has it helped with any of the things that would make our lives better? With staffing our NHS, with our education? Has it helped our economy? Has it even helped control immigration? It is impossible to find a single thing that has improved because of Brexit? Indeed, has Brexit helped Putin, more than it helped Britain.\nAcross businesses large and small, in all sectors, across healthcare, education, policing, immigration, science and research we find more complexity, more costs, more friction. But this government will keep telling you about the \"opportunities\". And Labour are too scared to be honest, too concerned to upset the balance they have struck with the pro-Brexit press and the “Red Wall” so they persist with the myth that it can be made to work. We need political leaders now to be honest about the damage Brexit has caused – and this will be the first step on the path to fixing the damage, and the probable slow path to rejoining.\nSome people have said to me we can't keep on looking back [at Brexit]. I agree. As a country we have to look forwards. This for the UK is almost our \"Stunde Null\" - what Germany called the zero hour - from now on, only forwards, only better. We need to be only concerned with making the lives of our people better in every way that we can. We tried Brexit, and it failed. If our future prosperity and opportunities for our people would be better, then of course we should consider joining the EU and let's leave Brexit behind for good. We can be prouder of what Britain can achieve by committing to peace and trade in Europe, than staying out and being forced to be proud only of what we did in the past.",

Obviously English.\nThis first evening passes in a not unfamiliar chatty blur of (totally UNfamiliar) Greek lager: ΑΛΦΑ. Soulatso's is more or less a pub. The Greek men smoke inside. That's about the only pub culture difference I can see. That and the interest in basketball. Otherwise, I might as well be in Devizes. Except, of course, Devizes has been taken over now. By Sauron.\nOutside Soulatso's, fishing boats make gentle plashy sounds in the moonlit harbour. No, we're not in Devizes any more.....\nBut nobody told my flat, which has no heating and is now colder than a fridge. I am a comatose block of ice till morning. When I'm thawed awake by sunshine.\nDays go by. Walks are walked. Sherlock Bryson here makes his observations.\nMost mornings I'll see a couple of guys slapping rags repetitively against the harbour rocks. For 10 minutes. 15 maybe. Goes on and on. These rags need. To. Be. Taught. A..... Lesson!\nGet closer......Ah, I see: fishermen tenderising octopuses.\nMotorbikes are the way to get around. Helmets seem to have gone out of fashion here. Stocky Greek men, often with a child on their lap, dwarf what's nearly always some version of a Honda 50; their faces in neutral. Peter Fonda eat your heart out.\nThe music that you catch from the houses is Greek. A guy ululating over scratchy violin and bouzouki. I'm not hearing any U.S. or U.K. music anywhere.\nBut listen, a hive of activity it is not.\nI start each day with an online Greek lesson. Yup, first thing every morning, just to kill any sliver of hope that I might ever be able to speak this language. Slowly I make contact with locals. Hear their stories. See their points of view. There's another bar. Grigori's place.\nMuch more English spoken here by the Greeks. And it's smaller, open later, talk is looser....\nBrexit? I think is good. Germans bankrupt our country. U.K. be fine. Big country. Strong country. We should have left. But....too small. Too weak......\nTrump? I like. Make economy strong.\nWe're back in Devizes.\nOne evening I watch some internet footage of Yanis Varoufakis and Brian Eno chewing the fat about politics. They both come across very well. Reasonable. Well intentioned. Both keen for the E.U. project to succeed. Later I check what they think of Varoufakis at Grigori's....\nVaroufakis? A clown!\nOkay, I move on to climate change. Maybe we can find some common ground here. This island has a water issue. There is no potable water. Not uncommon in the Cyclades islands. You buy your water in plastic bottles. And these bottles get \"recycled\". But, in Grigori's, they're all sure that they don't get recycled. That they get taken to Paros. And burnt or buried.\nWhat can you do, Grigori shrugs. I suggest desalination plants? ....\nHa! These rich people have in their houses here. In San Georgio. Crazy. Use up massive electricity. And the saltwater discharge go straight into the sea. Poisons the sea. Too salty. They don't give a shit. They swim in their pools.\nWhere do they get water for swimming pools, I ask. Grigori shrugs. Rich people get what they want. That's life. So get rich, or die trying. No other solution.\nSame old same old. But because I'm not in England.....bearable. When a 22-year-old flares up about European media coverage of the Lesbos refugee situation, I'm shocked at his anger. They're just people like you and me, escaping a dreadful situation, I suggest to him...\nYes, just like you and me. But Muslims. You understand? 400 years Muslims occupy my country. Greece a nation less than 200 years. Fragile country. But we are Western country. They cannot be happy here. Their culture does not work here.......\nI didn't know Greece had been occupied for 400 years by the Turks. I also didn't know that Greece only got its independence very recently. I probably knew some Byron stuff. Fever. Mussolinghi. War. Death. But that was really about him, not Greece. I didn't know that Greece wasn't Greece, until 1832. Never had been. Even in Socrates's time.\nThis is a very young country. Wearing very ancient robes.\nFor the next few weeks, I relax during the sunny days and freeze at night. Sleep with my clothes on, until I find a shop in Paros that sells an electric blanket. Problem solved. I rent a bike while I'm in Paros. \"How long do you want it for?\" \"......4 months?\"....\nShe looks a little shocked. I suppose bikes are normally rented by the day or week.\nI mean, I won't be in Greece for ALL of those months. I've got a flight to Gatwick booked for March 7th - got to go back to get 4 more arthritis drug epipens of course, and do...other stuff, but I'm hoping to get back to Greece in early or mid-April, so .....yes, 4 months παρακαλώ.\nAnyway, I leave Paros with a bike.\nAnd start biking around the islands. Beautiful beautiful places. I won't bang on too much, but trust me, you'd like them. And in January and February: empty. No tourists at all.\nAll to myself. Me and my bike. There are whole days that pass by now, when those appalling words Cummings, Johnson, Farage, Banks, .....Mogg.......don't cross ( really really cross!!..) my mind. At all.\nAnd then my bike and I........ try Syros.",
  "https_www_eastwiltslibdems_org_uk_/https_www_eastwiltslibdems_org_uk_news_article_police-and-crime-commissioner-elections/content_19.html": "Police and Crime Commissioner Elections\nAs you know, the recent Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) elections did not go as we had hoped. Despite Alan Hagger being an excellent and very experienced candidate, the Liberal Democrats finished fourth in a tightly contested four-horse race. However, it wasn't all gloom and doom as in Wiltshire we beat the Labour candidate into fourth place and we've learned valuable lessons from the experience.\nPCC elections are quite different from other elections. They cover a much larger population than elections for a Member of Parliament. In our case, this included the population of Wiltshire and Swindon. Additionally, the role we were electing for has direct control over approximately £150 million worth of vital public services.\nSeveral factors worked against us:\n-\nDebates Over the Post's Existence: A significant portion of the campaign was overshadowed by debates about whether the PCC post should exist at all. This was unhelpful as the post does exist and will undoubtedly continue.\n-\nConcurrent Elections: In Wiltshire, the PCC elections were standalone, whereas in Swindon, they coincided with the Borough Council elections. Since the Lib Dems are relatively weak in Swindon and Labour is very strong, this led to a strong Labour showing, challenging the Conservative incumbent closely.\n-\nIndependent Candidate: An independent candidate running for the third time, with a strong following based on the slogan \"keep politics out of policing,\" also drew significant support. While this slogan resonates with many, it overlooks the fact that all public services are managed by politicians, making it challenging to propose a viable alternative.\nDespite these hurdles, we did very well in the areas where we are active, such as Amesbury, Salisbury and Chippenham where we were the larger party. We remain committed to learning from these experiences and strengthening our position for future elections. I am remaining on as the Wiltshire and Swindon Criminal Justice official spokesperson and will be using this role to challenge the PCC when he doesn’t fulfil his promises over the next 4 years.\nThank you for your continued support and dedication and all of the help and good wishes that I received during the campaign.",

Larkrise (Trowbridge), St Nicholas (Chippenham) and Rowdeford (Devizes) will be replaced by one new, academy-run, special school in Devizes.\nThe vote was unanimous even after many heartfelt pleas - from teachers, governors and parents -expressing concerns over increased travel times, lack of an A&E facility in Devizes, reduction of parental choice and the education of their children outside their communities.\nA three-school solution was supported by 71 per cent of respondents to a consultation on these changes. So why did the cabinet vote for a single school instead?\nWiltshire Council needs more places for children with Special Education Need and/or Disability (SEND) and they need to improve the quality of that provision. The council also wants to reduce the cost of having Wiltshire children placed in independent and out of county schools.\nThey believe that one \"centre of excellence\" will solve these problems and that the only real question was where it should be. The Rowdeford site, in Devizes, was selected as it has excellent outdoor education facilities, room for growth, and is a central location for the whole of North Wiltshire.\nI've been following this consultation closely as I've been campaigning to reduce the travel times SEND children in Marlborough experience. It is not just the time to travel from Marlborough to Devizes but the fact that these minibuses travel around the county picking up many children, resulting in some highly vulnerable children being on the bus for nearly two hours, each way, every day.\nOn hearing that the location of the new school was to be Devizes I felt relief that our Marlborough children will not have to travel even further to school, as would have happened if their school had been relocated to Chippenham or Trowbridge. But I do feel for the parents and children in Chippenham and Trowbridge who are now faced with the prospect of their children having to travel so far to school.\nThe proposal also addressed some of the concerns raised during the consultation about a large 'super' school being overwhelming for the children. Cllr Laura Mayes explained that it will be designed to have \"a series of small units on a spacious site\" thus giving a small-feel to the school whilst maintaining the advantages of a big school such as full time medical and health care professionals and its own transport. The school should also be able to provide support and options for the 3,500 children - with Educational, Health and Care Plans (EHCP) - who are in mainstream schools. That sort of support is currently completely absent.\nA formal consultation now starts, with a final decision to be made by cabinet in March 2019. The council will be looking for an academy partner to run this new school and to provide the support to all mainstream secondary schools in the county. Cllr Laura Mayes has invited parents, governors and teachers to get involved in the design of the new school.\nWe should get involved and keep a watchful eye on the developing plans for this new school. We need to see that it delivers the right environment for SEND children to thrive. We need to ensure the academy partner chosen is committed to delivering SEND support to all mainstream schools.\nWe need to ensure that Marlborough's SEND children have the shortest travel times possible. And finally, because the new school is only for children up to the age of 16, we need to ensure that one of the proposed Transition Hubs for post 16 education is close to Marlborough.",

Under this arrangement, families struggling to pay their mortgage could sell part of the equity in their home and rent it back from a housing association or private firm.\n\"These plans could be funded using money already committed to social housing but currently unspent because of the collapse of new building. They would also save taxpayers the cost of re-housing the homeless without going down the disastrous route of giving open-ended guarantees for new mortgage lending.\"",

Its clear that people of all political shades are very unhappy with where we are, with a fair majority placing blame squarely with the Tories.\nIf you have decided, like almost everyone I spoke to yesterday, that you absolutely want to remove this Conservative government from power, then there is a 3 stage decision taken in this order: (1) who is the candidate and party most likely to defeat Danny Kruger here in Wiltshire? (2) am I \"sufficiently\" happy with that candidate and their party's policies and (3) what are the wider implications of that party gaining an extra seat in Westminster. The answers I discussed yesterday with broad agreement are:\n-\nOnly the Liberal Democrats and David Kinnaird can defeat the Tories here. Even in 1997, at the height of the National Labour landslide with Tony Blair at the height of his powers, In Devizes and Salisbury, the Lib Dems came second and Labour third. Labour have not yet announced a candidate and will rightly focus all their attention on Swindon. The Greens will focus their more limited resources on Bristol. We wish them all the best. East Wilts will be Lib Dem\nSO - David Kinnaird - Lib Dems = YES\n-\nI hope so. There is no published manifesto yet, but a good public draft version. We offer a broad centre ground policy platform with a firm commitments to 3 key policy areas. Net Zero, Electoral Reform (we have to get rid of First Past the Post - I'll write more about this elsewhere), and finally a path to gradually reclaiming the social and economic benefits of EU membership by, in the future rejoining. (Again, this is a bigger topic - and I don't think it looking backwards as someone said to me yesterday - for young people who have lost so much that we enjoyed, it is very much an optimistic look forwards)\nSo - Lib Dems = YES\n-\nIt would be a disaster for the Tories to be re-elected. The second disaster would be Labour Government with a huge majority that would provide them with too much power. A government must be held to account by parliament. The best option has to be for the Lib Dems to gain 50-60 seats and to be able effectively to hold Starmer to account.\nSo - Lib Dems = GOOD",

Some issues go beyond party loyalty and the inbuilt threat that disagreeing will damage our political prospects.\nWhat we said was that it would take us 6 years to remove the fees but that in the mean time we would not agree to any rise in their level. Vince Cable's original statement on the Brown report made it very clear that this was being done in order to cut higher education spending as part of the deficit reduction, as part of smaller government. The effect is the privatisation of higher education.\nThe State is saying that it is not willing to pay for education post 18. The funding arrangements mean that the state is saying it sees no value to the state in education post 18 in subjects that do not have an immediate value to the state such as medicine. I for one cannot agree to this point of view and I see this as a slippery slope. All education benefits all of us. Well educated individuals fulfilling their potential give more to society in many ways and cost less.\nIf our elected MP's do not vote against the rise in tuition fees they are making liars of us all and more importantly taking the wrong decision.\"\nThe 104 PPCs are not alone in their thinking.

The flip side of this is that most do not seem to realise the 'red top' fuelled view the public have of Prisoners.\nI hear in my head now one describe himself as \"one of you\" because he had been a Councillor, another tell me he read politics at university and another proudly tell me how he had gained 4 diplomas.

While we are still awaiting the details of their first budget, the omens are far from encouraging. Aside from the furore over Sir Keir's clothes, the bigger picture is that government appears to be returning to the familiar ground of austerity—an approach that, as we’ve seen before, can stifle public services and limit long-term growth. Cuts to crucial benefits, such as the Pensioners’ Winter Fuel Allowance, are already on the table, and this looks like a poor decision at a time when the cost-of-living crisis continues to bite. These cuts risk leaving some of our most vulnerable citizens even more exposed to the hardships of inflation and rising energy bills.\nThe government is straitjacketed by rigid fiscal rules and red lines on Europe, which is preventing them from exploring the full range of tools available to stimulate investment and growth. Austerity alone will not solve the challenges we face; what is desperately needed are bold measures to encourage economic recovery, investment in green energy, and infrastructure that would modernise the economy and create jobs.\nThere are some glimmers of hope. It's pleasing to see the government finally being more honest about immigration. With the abandonment of the deeply flawed Rwanda deportation scheme, it seems there is at least some recognition that a more humane, practical approach to immigration is needed. Likewise, the plans for investment in energy and rail infrastructure look promising—assuming they are followed through.\nHowever, one glaring omission in the government’s priorities is the issue of sewage pollution. Despite widespread public concern, there is little meaningful progress on this front. The reality is that regulating the water industry alone will not solve the problem of raw sewage being dumped into our rivers and seas. What is needed is substantial investment in upgrading our water infrastructure, something that cannot be achieved without a serious commitment of resources.\nAs we await the budget, it’s clear that this government needs to focus on long-term, sustainable solutions rather than austerity-driven cuts if it is to deliver the investment, growth, and public services the country desperately needs. Labour austerity is just as bad as Tory austerity, Labour Brexit as damaging as Tory Brexit. This doesn't look like the change we were promised.",

Good of you to come with the other rival attraction on television.\nI live in this constituency and have done so for over 20 years, I've worked here, volunteered here, used the NHS here, used the public transport here, driven here and watched as successive governments national & local have overseen the closure of Post Offices - Village Schools - and Hospital Services.\nMany of you know of my interest in transport and my work with PVTAG on the Wigglybus project. Now being cut back since Wiltshire Council took it over and dispensed with the community advice and involvement. I have also been involved in various ways with CPRE and VAK. Currently I am involved with PCAP looking at Education & leisure.\nSince my Mother died I have gone back to teaching mathematics to those who find it a bit challenging.\nWhy do I want to be an MP? because I think that it is about time that the interests of those of us who live in Rural Britain were represented at Westminster.\nToo often we are treated as an annoying anomaly to the policies of urban bureaucrats.\nWe need an MP to fight for the solutions that fit us here\nI wish to thank Marlborough Council of Churches for organising this hustings. Real Democracy.\nI will take the opportunity to tell you a little about our Liberal Democrat policies but first I want to say something about the state of our democracy.\nIs democracy best served by two grown men shouting at each other once a week? Cheered on by others who might be supporting their local football team? Is it well served by an un-elected second chamber? By MP's and governments elected by less than half of those voting? By the date at which we all have the chance to vote in a general election being at the whim of the Prime Minister?\nI don't think so. Fixed term parliament, proportional representation, an elected second chamber and a written constitution are things that Lib Dems have been calling for for years. I think their time has come. Liberal Democrats will Restore and protect hard-won British Civil Liberties with a Freedom Bill.\nIt may be taking a little longer but I still want to break the mould of British Politics just as I did when I joined the SDP.\nLabour, well they seem to have had a road to Damascus conversion to these ideas as the election has drawn near. Not good enough, they have had 13 years to introduce these reforms and they have not done it.\nOne of the issues that is top of the agenda for many people in this area is the NHS.\nYou have seen your hospital modernised and then your services withdrawn - what a waste of money?\nWe will give people the power to have a say in how their local NHS is run and stop hospital closures in their area. We will devolve power to local people through elected health boards - if they don't listen then you will be able to vote them out.\nWe will make it illegal for a local health board to allow a doctor to work in the UK for the first time without passing robust language and competence tests.\nWe will ensure that local GPs provide out-of-hours care.\nWe will integrate health and social care.\nLiberal Democrats are totally committed to the NHS. Free at the point of use - care when you need it, regardless of your ability to pay. But that is just our starting point. The real challenge we face is to improve the NHS at a time when the public finances are in a mess.\nLiberal Democrats will halve the size of the Dept of Health over the next parliament and reinvest the money in patient care. We will cut the number of health guanos by a third and abolish the strategic health authorities.\nFair Tax\nVince Cable's proposal to raise the threshold for paying income tax to £10,000 will lift many low paid workers and pensioner right out of paying income tax. Most people will be £700 a year better of. It will be paid for by closing the unfair tax loopholes exploited by the very rich, pollution taxes and by the mansion tax.\nThis is money that will help the economy to recover.\nVince Cable is very clear about how we tackle the economy. First you do not risk the recovery until it is clearly underway. Then you look at what government spends, you prioritise and you cut out the unnecessary.

Not tax breaks for a narrow group.\nNow there has been a lot of talk about efficiency savings. Think we might know a bit about this here don't you. How our Tory led Councils told us that if we had a single Unitary Council there would be efficiency savings, they would have the money for things like mending the roads - what have we got, a higher than average council tax rise and pot holes in the road so big they are a danger to cyclists.\nEducation\nThere is one area where we think extra spending is called for and that is education\nA fair chance for every child\nOur plans for a pupil premium will give over £11million to schools in Wiltshire. Money Head Teachers can use to raise standards and outcomes for all our children. They might use it for extra staff to make class sizes smaller or to give extra help to those who fall behind.\nYou've been let down by Labour for the last 13 years.

The launch marks the start of a national campaign that will see cutting crime as the centrepiece of the Liberal Democrat run-up to the local elections in May.\nLaunching the campaign, Menzies Campbell said:\n\"Shockingly, we live in a country where only one in every hundred crimes committed leads to a court conviction.\n\"Just one in every hundred.\n\"That means you are twice as likely to buy a winning lottery ticket as you are to be convicted in court of a crime that you have committed.\"\nThe five step plan to a safer Britain is:\n- More police on patrol rather than wasting billions on ID cards\n- Empowering the public to take back town centres\n- Honesty in sentencing - including making life mean life\n- Compulsory work and training in prison to cut re-offending\n- Better compensation for victims, paid for by prison work\nMenzies Campbell will add:\n\"To fight crime effectively, we don't need to get tougher, we need to get smarter.\n\"A liberal approach to crime is an honest approach to crime. It is based on what works rather than what sounds good.\n\"It targets the offender rather than the innocent. And it has the courage to engage with the criminal and reform their behaviour.\"",

In your tweets, and in your letter to the Gazette you have sought to downplay his actions and cast them as just the sort of action any man in that position would undertake.\nThis is an admirable defence, but it misses the whole point. He is not just any man - he is the most senior advisor to the PM. He apparently did not consider, in his carefully weighed analysis, how his breaking and bending of the rules would look to a national population who had been instructed to abide by them. This alone marks down his judgment below any acceptable level - He doesn't care about a \"good look\" when that is exactly what he should care about. He set the rules, he must be seen to abide by them, not use cunning artifice to conveniently set them aside. There was no extreme emergency that justified his flight to Durham. He had no reasonable excuse to leave his house, despite his lawyered-up statement delivered on Monday.\nHis further justification for his outing to Barnard Castle on his wife's birthday is risible, pathetic - and it demeans all those who support it. Even Gove realized how dismal it sounded when having to say that he had also gone for a drive to check his eyesight. Ultimately for all his complex post- justification, he risked other people's lives to look after his family\nYour internal note to fellow MPs I'm afraid signals the real truth. Cummings is indispensable to Johnson and you must twist and distort your own judgement to forgive him anything so he can stay alongside our broken PM. I once admired the Tory party for its sense of fairness and honesty. It seems the only things it is now any good at are lies, deception, and the retention of power. Apparently, whatever the cost.\nOur COVID-19 death toll is horrendous - approaching the civilian death toll from WW2, we still have no workable track, trace and isolate mechanism, we have lied about the number of tests undertaken, we have lied about herd immunity, we have lied about PPE. The Cummings affair shows we can even lie about a birthday drive to a castle if that's what it takes. And of course, Brexit was based almost entirely on lies and factual distortions and these continue with further lies about the GB/NI border and lies about the EU trade deal.\nI'm sickened by what your party's lies are doing to our country. The Cummings affair is important, as I think all those who you deceived about Brexit are now seeing that deceit laid bare. It was perhaps one lie too many.\nDavid Kinnaird",

  "https_www_eastwiltslibdems_org_uk_/https_www_eastwiltslibdems_org_uk_news_article_its-all-about-you/content_31.html": "It's All About You\n190 Miles, 300 doors knocked, 500+ conversations: My extraordinary trip around East Wiltshire by bike\nDay 1: GWH – Liddington – Wanborough – Hinton Parva - Bishopstone\nThe trip had been originally planned as a fundraiser for the Stroke Association and had been due to start from the front of the Hospital, with some of the stroke team who were so instrumental in saving my life 2 years ago. Due to the call of the election, we could not do that, so began instead at the turn off from the Marlborough Road.\nOn this particular day, huge queues of traffic going in as there seemed to be insufficient parking places. The hospital opened only 20 years ago is already operating beyond is design capacity.\nThe constituency boundary travels southwards down the Honington road and we cycle into a new estate and use the megaphone for the first time. We canvass some doors, most people unaware that they are in East Wiltshire, when logically of course they should sit with Swindon.\nI then immediately fell off (at low speed!) riding across an uncut grass verge as my front wheel disappeared down a huge but invisible hole. No harm!\nHeading east, under the A419 and then suddenly we are in rural Wiltshire. To Liddington, Wanborough and lunch at the Plough. I chatted to 3 locals at the bar, who reluctantly at first discussed politics but warmed. One gentleman shook my hand and thanked me for standing and urged me to try and help the NHS.\nBack on the bikes, some more canvassing (all positive), a few megaphone calls and on the road to Hinton Parva and Bishopstone. We gained a few poster sites (the yellow diamonds) on the way, and felt encouraged by the conversations. My doorstep pitch – (sometimes shortened to suit) is:\nHi - I’m David. I’m the Lib Dem Candidate for East Wilts. I’m 57 – so I am not a career politician. I am my own man. I’m running for the first time as I can no longer sit shouting at the TV whilst our nation declines, and the opportunities for our children disappear. I’ve lived in Wiltshire for 29 years, in Bulford, Wroughton, Chiseldon, Devizes and now Marlborough. I am genuinely local. All my kids have gone to state schools here, local hospitals delivered my kids and GWH saved my life. I drive on the same potholed roads as you every day and pay my Council Tax here.\nI’ve had a career in the Army, leaving as a Major after 15 years, and then a career in technology, software and networking. I’ve got the local knowledge and the business and real-world skills and experience that we need in Parliament.\nI have never worked for a right wing think tank, been a “Spin Doctor”, or a “Special Advisor”. I am not from politics; I am from life.\nI am passionate about honesty in politics as it is dishonesty that has brought us here. Dishonesty about gold wallpaper, parties, trips to Barnard Castle, PPE contracts, but above all dishonesty about the extent to which austerity has collapsed our public services and dishonesty about Brexit which has removed our opportunity to grow the economy and fix them. Neither Labour or the Tories are being honest about this to the electorate and offering anything that will fix it. We need a strong centre ground party to prize open the truth and reality of what we face. We need to be honest, to have grown-ups in the room – only then can we begin to fix our country. The truth is that to begin to repair our services we will require tax increases. The truth is that to grow our economy we have to repair our relationship with Europe and rule nothing out.\nWe also absolutely need to think about electoral reform – huge majorities on small vote shares are undemocratic and lead to voter apathy and bipolar politics. We cannot have red/blue/red/blue forever. We have to have parties of all colours working together, to make the lives of the people that live here better not just work for power for the next 5 years. This is why I am standing for the Liberal Democrats, and this is why you should vote for me. Be Brave Vote Dave\nAlmost every doorstep conversation based on this went well. People like this. It’s common sense. It’s untainted by politics.\nWe carried this on at the Royal Oak – in politics corner. I spoke to an initially reluctant pig farmer, who was passionate and so happy with his job. Alarmingly I met the second person of my travels who had no acceptable form of Voter ID and did not know how to get one – I promised to send him the details.\nDay 2: Bishopstone – Baydon – Aldbourne - Ramsbury\nTo Baydon, we crossed the ridgeway on our tiny bike, much to the concern of the pro cyclist in our support team – but it was fine, and beautiful. Stopped at a few very remote houses to the surprise of occupants who admitted they had never been doorstepped before. We hit the shop at Aldbourne and canvassed all the houses around the green. We found a lovely lady celebrating her 90th birthday, a committed Lib Dem who knew David Steele.\nI sent a note to Bear Grylls asking him to be even braver, and Vote Dave.\nNot enjoying the B4192 and running late we had to skip Chilton Foliat and headed straight to Ramsbury for the D -Day commemoration and Beacon lighting. I loaned my megaphone to the poor vicar with a sore throat who was struggling to make herself heard and had to stand, a little awkwardly at her side during the service. But happy to help.\nDay 3: Ramsbury – Froxfield - Bedywns – Wilton - Burbage\nFroxfield – we met the lovely Pat and Barry who showed us their motorbikes, made us tea and invited us to the Beer festival taking place the next day.\nLittle Bedwyn very quiet, I only managed to speak to one person! But then to Great Bedwyn and lunch at the amazing Wendy’s Community Juice Bar based in an old village Bowling Clubhouse. We met the rights of way team, discussed the challenges of definitive footpath routing and had a lovely lunch. Oher more macho cyclists looked with some pity at our fold up bikes.\nTook a detour to travel along the canal and to deliberately speak to some continuous cruisers who I knew had some challenges. The fees have climbed by 65% over 3 years, but the key facilities of water and waste disposal are just not working.\nDinner and a chat with locals at the Swan at Wilton. Same issues arise – huge lack of trust and disengagement with politics. Everyone seemed to wish me well. I hope this translates to votes.\nDay 4: Burbage – Grafton – Chutes - Ludgershall\nOn the way to Grafton we found some papers scattered on the road and having scooped them up found a few phone numbers and tracked down the grateful owner. She had left them in her diary on the roof of her car!\nThis is not an area that I have travelled through much and it is stunning. David Pike – who lives in Chute rode with us and provided a constant stream of commentary on houses, history and roman roads. The hills are epic, and the lack of gears hurt. But we pressed on.\nLudgershall was in full flow with a D-Day party and I toured the grounds. I had long sit-down chat with Veterans in Action. No photos as I didn’t think it great to try and pitch next to a Charity. Billy McLoud has built the charity from scratch delivering Wilderness and Adventure therapy – and it has worked. The big takeaway for me was that smaller charities can be more effective and efficient in delivering results than the biggest (SSAFA, Combat Street, RBL, H4H). I committed to coming to visit and supporting if I was elected, and if I had time, even if not. We need to recognise the contribution of the smallest charities.\nI spoke to as many young people as I could – many not voting, but gave them BE BRAVE VOTE DAVE cards and at least had a laugh. I hope they do vote.\nMeet and Greet at the Queen’s head was quiet – but it was a beautiful summer’s evening after all!\nDay 5: Ludgershall – Collingbournes – Everleigh - Tidworth\nThe Collingbournes were great. We spent lots of time at the Cricket club, admiring the new clubhouse and chatting to everyone. I met a Royal Signals officer who is working for the Chief of the Defence Staff – Patrick Sanders who I was at Staff College with – so I asked him to pass on a BE BRAVE card.\nLunch at the Barleycorn and a really long conversation about SEND residential care with the owners of a small family run care home that was eye opening. Children’s residential care, foster care and special schools have steadily been taken over by profit-making companies with no transparency of charging and huge profits. Also, widely different increases and changes in Social Care rates from different local authorities make long term planning difficult. The genuine care this home delivers is remarkable. They take all their residents away on holiday every year, and their son Jamie won an award for his work with Makaton. Incredible to hear that by helping one patient so much, they actually lost money as care needs were assessed as being lower. Urgh.\nAcross the plain to Everleigh on the worst track of the trip (we had to walk). A brief conversation with a resident of Berwick St James – and we couldn’t immediately work out if it was inside East Wilts or not – but he said if it was he would vote for me!\nTidworth to the Ram pub on national DAVE day commemorating the life and loss of the Hairy Biker Dave Myers. When I lived in Bulford, the Ram was out of bounds to Officers, so I have never visited. It was really good, lively and vibrant pub. Big issues that emerged was the very high water bills charged by Veolia, the sometimes poor quality of accommodation (married and single).\nDinner was a Kebab. A rare treat..\nDay 6: Tidworth – Bulford - Amesbury\nLisa left me to go back and help with deliveries and leaflets. I had a quick and excellent shave and haircut from one of the Tidworth barbers and off to Bulford and then Amesbury. I called in at our old MQ in Bulford. It hadn’t changed much. The occupier’s daughter was revising her GCSEs so didn’t delay – but wished them well. I also called in to my old Commanding Officers house – with none of the nervousness that I had back then! More votes there.\nMore door knocking all around the quarters, and in Bulford village. I met a member of the Parish Council who had received my original letter about the trip and was pleased to chat. Also a lady who was looking after he husband who had a stroke. We talked strokes, care, carers allowance and about the Stroke Association. I was incredibly lucky to be unscathed.\nI then had a really long conversation with a phenomenally engaged RAF officer and his wife out walking their dog. Thank-you and I hope I convinced you.\nTelegraph hill then nearly killed me. I didn’t realise there was a path I could have pushed my bike up until I got to the top.\nInto Amesbury, canvassing on the way, and the heavens then opened. A good pint and politics at The George (and the rooms there are excellent) – lively discussion and real optimism.\nDay 7: Amesbury – The Woodfords – Great Wishford\nI had been looking forward to this day, heading out of Amesbury down the Woodford valley. This was all in the Salisbury constituency and it does feel naturally aligned South, not North, and if elected I will need to work hard to ensure that I engage here. I have already written to a resident suggesting that I will hold regular surgeries in Amesbury, Pewsey, Wroughton and Tidworth/Ludgershall as well as a constituency office in Marlborough. Many doors I knocked on still did not know the boundaries had changed – and I had to explain (not always successfully) it wasn’t my fault.\nCrossing the sparkling Avon at West Amesbury, I made a video about sewage pollution. It is quite unbelievable is has been allowed to reach this point.\nSo many conversations mainly with passers-by rather than through door knocking. Memorably one lady told me that I had let myself down by calling myself Dave – “only if you are a crashing snob madam”. She grinned.. and took a leaflet!\nLunch at the Bridge, and a conversation with every occupied table. A leaflet for Sting’s house, a knock on as many doors as possible and finally to the very Southern tip of the constituency at Great Wishford. A very lovely and lively Pint and Politics at the Royal Oak with 20 odd conversations on everything from vaccinations to the Army and a very long conversation with a head teacher about issues in education. One single mum nurse came to see me to tell me of her disgust with Johnson for the lies and the parties. I agreed. The pub is great, just reopened and a real treasure. I stayed at the old post office B&B and slept like a log.\nDay 8: Great Wishford – Berwick St James – Winterbourne Stoke – Shrewton - Tilshead\nHeading North now – the uphill run home begins. Amazingly, I managed to track down the guy I met in Collingbourne who lived in Berwick St James to tell him that yes – it is in the constituency (obviously) and I had a cup of tea there. Most conversations here dominated by traffic and the Stonehenge Tunnel – almost all living here want it to go ahead as relief from the traffic chaos that ensues all summer. I stopped in Winterbourne Stoke (a village bisected by the A303) to chat to Ian West who was a councillor for years and with huge experience on the tunnel. We had spoken before, but had never met and he is a gentleman.\nThrough Shrewton – stopping at the Garage for some air and a breather and left some leaflets and spoke roadside to residents. I then was picked up to get back to Marlborough for a meeting on Flooding, and then back on my bike afterwards to Tilshead for a very busy Wednesday evening at the Rose and Crown and again felt strong support and goodwill. Overnight with friends.\nDay 9: Tilshead – Larkhill – Durrington – Figheldean - Netheravon\nTo Larkhill, in blustery wind. Called in at Trinity Grain which I had never seen before – a huge grain storage facility – perhaps the largest in the South of England. Knocked on 30 doors + but only managed 2 conversations, so went to the café in search of people but not much joy there either! Headed to Durrington to Maples café and knocked doors at last finding people to talk to. A lady here told me she has been waiting 18m for a knee operation and has been unable to work. Her PIP and Universal Credit means she can just live. No passport, no internet, not TV license. If her knee were fixed she would get her life and her dignity back.\nDoor knocking next in Figheldean and someone knows me already – a friend of the man from Berwick St James.\nFinally to Netheravon and another lively Pint and Politics at the Dog and Gun. People really do want grown up politics, and can see that a strong third party would help with that.\nDay 10: Netheravon – East Chisenbury – Upavon – Rushall - Marden\nRaining. I spent a long coffee break in the Netheravon café and joined a family table of 6 for a long conversation about housing, care and challenges of EHCPs. I also discovered the scandal of visa costs for overseas spouses that have married a UK serviceman or woman. We charge £1000s of pounds in Visa fees just for spouses to be able to reside in the UK. Its hostile and unnecessary.\nTo East Chisenbury – popped into the Red Lion for water only and a chat to anyone there, into Upavon and canvassed a number of houses. Some very disaffected conservative voters whom I hope I gave confidence that there is a credible alternate.\nThrough Rushall, past Joe Wookey’s amazing Organic farm and to Marden to stay with friends and another P&P at the Millstream. All supporters!\nDay 11: Marden – Chirton – Bottlesford - Pewsey\nRaining a lot. This was not a great day as I kept leaving things behind. My helmet twice – and then each time didn’t realise until I had gone 5 miles so had to retrace my steps. Few people in, no one out and about – but I stuck to it, knocking up nearly 40 doors. I did speak to Anthony – out on a run who was thinking Labour, but I converted him on PR, on Brexit and on being a local person. I also fell off again (pothole, but soft landing). A good chat with a farmer concerned about lack of subsidy for their type of farming, and prospect of GM being permitted under a Labour government. I had to skip Beechingstoke (sorry), but popped into the Seven Stars at Bottlesford and spoke to 4/5 family groups – all very positive. Finally, to Pewsey along the main road which isn’t pleasant on a bike, but an excellent P&P at the Royal Oak. Excellent discussion about the lack of profitability in dairy farming and the lack of power felt by farmers, and about Domiciliary Care provision – particularly about the disparity between different private providers on the amount of time allocated to provide care to a client.\nDay 12: Pewsey – Wilton – Honeystreet - Lockeridge\nSunshine again, and a glorious start through Wilcot by the canal. Lots of passers-by to chat to, all willing to talk. The Pewsey vale looked glorious and I took a detour off of my planned route and headed to the Honeystreet café and then the Barge at Honeystreet and had a very good 2 hours talking to almost every table. Even tables that didn’t want to talk then joined in! I think a combination of the sunshine and so many positive conversations started to give me real hope that we can make a change here. To Lockeridge, a few more Danny Kruger signs in evidence here, but knocked doors, stopped cars (one had heard my “Vote Dave” song). At the Who’da the pub crowd were positive. I had a long chat outside with a local retired but well-connected businessman which went well and then headed in. England game was on, but we had 10 people to come and listen and ask questions. Thank you for a really enjoyable night.\nDay 13: Lockeridge – Avebury - Wroughton\nA long ride to Avebury and then on to Wroughton. I stopped at every village and knocked at least 5 doors each. Quick pause for lunch at Avebury – almost everyone here was from outside the constituency. I was joined by the indefatigable Stan, one of our members from Swindon who had cycled out to Avebury to cycle back to Wroughton with me. We door knocked again, found another poster site. And endured, not enjoyed the A4361 to Wroughton – there isn’t really an alternate route and it’s not a good road for cyclists.\nWe headed to Wichelstowe first, and then back to Wroughton, a call into Berkley Farm, and some more door knocking, but finally to the White Hart for 7:30 – huge apologies to those that came at 6:30pm due to an error on our leaflet and then came back – but we got there and thank you for your patience.\nDay 14: Wroughton – Chisledon – The Ogbournes\nHome straight! To Chiseldon first to the church my first daughter Charlotte was christened. I looked at a Bees nest in the rafters, and enjoyed the churchyard. I met Ros who had travelled down from Aldbourne to say hello, knocked on some doors to get some conversations going. I called into our old house at Talavera Road to find all 8 Married Quarters there derelict and unoccupied. Its scandalous – I made a short video about the sale or Defence quarters estate and why it was such a bad deal.\nI was joined by some outriders for the final journey back along the Sustrans path to Marlborough. Almost impossible to cross the main A346 by the Silks – there is just too much traffic on this route.\nThrough the Ogbournes and back to Marlborough and a final welcome back at the Green Dragon\nSo What did I find out\n190 Miles, 300 doors knocked, 150 opened! 500 + conversations almost all positive.\nI gained huge insight into as many lives as I could in a short period. Travelling by bike is unthreatening and accessible – you can just stop and chat to anyone. If elected, I absolutely commit to doing this every year I am in office.\nWhat I heard, chimes with me. People really do want a change in politics, they want the county to be run by people making decisions cross par.ty for the long-term benefit of the people of this county.\nStop the games and deliver better lives.\nBe Brave, Vote Dave",

And in four London boroughs: Brent, Camden, Southwark and Hounslow.\nLabour are involved in 12 of the coalitions and the Liberal Democrats in 29.\nMike Thomas (site Moderator of www.charter2010.co.uk) said:\n\"Reservations about about hung parliaments are wholly legitimate; Charter 2010 has never advocated a hung parliament - we just want the parties to plan sensibly to deal with one if we get it. An aspiration that seems entirely reasonable with the polls where they are now.\nLabour and the Conservatives are absolutely entitled to say they are trying to win the election outright. But to add that a hung parliament - and the prospect of having to govern in coalition with others - offers an impossibly damaging prospect for the country doesn't make much sense, or show much respect for the commonsense of the electors.\nPerhaps it is time for the party leaders to consult with their supporters in local government. For many years now, they have been managing to achieve what their national counterparts apparently find so difficult to come to terms with.\""
