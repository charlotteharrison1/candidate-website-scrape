I hold a long term, bigger picture view of Europe which is definitely about being stronger together and not about finding differences or reasons to stand apart. Just as in any relationship, look for what works then focus on improving the rest. Don’t just walk away.\nI know the EU has problems as you would expect of an organisation of 28 different nationalities, cultures, languages, ways of working and inevitable bureaucracy. After 58 years of existence since formation in 1958 and having grown from 6 to 28 countries, who would expect different?\nOn the plus side, we are the largest economic trading block in the world with a population of over 500 million and most countries share a common currency, the Euro . We have achieved peace throughout Europe since two horrendous World Wars which started in Europe. Twelve countries were formerly behind the Iron Curtain . It is quite astonishing what has been achieved. I prefer to focus on the positive.\nUnfortunately, the UK media, at least the populist media, has been negative portraying the EU as a cash-sucking machine rather than a source of inward investment. Rarely are we told of the specific investments in eg infrastructure which are positively announced with a large EU flag on the Continent. It is unbelievable how many people still believe that EU migrants are to blame for most of the ills in our economy, from NHS, housing and education through jobs rather than the honest fact that EU migrants bring a positive benefit to our country to the tune of £20 billion in net taxation receipts. There are many reasons why our country is one of the most overcrowded in Europe and why the NHS always seems to be in crisis but these are nothing to do with EU migrants and more a result of policies from successive governments. On the contrary, I value their contribution to our economy, our rich multicultural society and particularly their huge presence within the NHS at all levels. Did you know there are Italian doctors working in various aspects of mental health services which is an area severely underfunded by this government?\nBrexit focused largely on two false promises which they know they cannot fulfil ie:\n- Saying the UK contribution to the EU is £350 million a week (false figure) and this saving would be spent on the NHS. They now admit this figure is wrong and that money cannot go to the NHS.\n- Saying they would cut immigration. They have admitted they have no plans for how to cut immigration.\nThe Brexit campaign lied to the people. They portrayed the European Union in a very negative way instead of a balanced look at the good and areas for possible reform.",

Europol – shares policing intelligence\n2. Eurojust – coordinates investigation and persecution of serious crime and terrorism\n3. European Medicines Agency – regulates quality, safety and provision of medicines across EU (your life might depend on one of these) and 6 months ahead of Canada and Oz\n4. European Aviation Safety Agency – self-explanatory\n5. European Food Safety Agency – eg USA wash chickens in chlorinated water and inject beef with growth hormones which are not allowed in Europe\nWhatever made you vote Leave, there are plenty more valid reasons to vote Remain. Write to your MP before it’s too late. Ask for assurances that this government will not leave us out in the cold when we currently enjoy so much protection.\nLeave a comment",

  "https_europeanbritblog_wordpress_com_/https_europeanbritblog_wordpress_com_tag_universities/content_33.html": "Every now and then a politician brings tears to my eyes and this time it was David Lammy, Labour MP for Tottenham who explained why he would not be voting to trigger Article 50 and so disobey his party’s 3 line whip.\nYou can watch his speech here, or read it below.\nhttp://www.parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/fe6bc3c9-5d0b-4808-ba0b-8ce9c08475c1 starting at 19:42.\nOn Tuesday evening (31st January) I spoke in the Second Reading of the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill.\nMany members of this House have long believed that the United Kingdom’s interests would be best served outside of the European Union.\nThey campaigned passionately for what they believe in and in their view we must now leave the European Union – no ifs, no buts and no questions asked.\nIt would be unfair if I didn’t acknowledge that 52% of those who voted on June 23rd voted to Leave.\nThe Prime Minister says she wants to deliver a Brexit that works for all and a Brexit that unites our divided country.\nI too want to bring this country back together.\nMembers right across this House will have experienced just how divided the country has become in the months leading up to last June and in the months since.\nYoung and old. Graduates and non-graduates. The haves and the have nots. City dwellers and those who live in smaller towns and rural communities.\nUnprecedented, deep divisions of the kind I have not seen in my lifetime.\nBut we cannot bring the country back together if we pretend that the country has spoken with one united voice.\nPeople who voted to Leave voted for all sorts of reasons, many of which had absolutely nothing to do with the European Union.\nI knocked on doors all over the country, from Hornsey to Huddersfield, and a lot of the Brexit voters I spoke to were actually voting against David Cameron and the Conservative Government.\nSome voted for Leave to send a message to Westminster and register a protest vote.\nSome said they were fed up with public services stretched to breaking point.\nSome said they felt trapped and helpless so they voted for Leave because – as one voter put it to me – “well things can’t get any worse, can they?”\nSo when the Prime Minister speaks of “the will of the people”, her interpretation is frankly no clearer or more precise that anyone else’s.\nLet’s not pretend that the people have spoken, because not all of them have.\nIn fact only 27% of the people of this country voted to Leave. 13 million people didn’t vote. Another 7 million eligible voters weren’t registered. 1 million British expatriates weren’t allowed to vote.\n16 year olds were denied a say, even though it was their futures that were on the ballot paper.\nOnly 2 of the 4 nations that make up the United Kingdom voted to Leave. There was no quadruple lock.\nThere was no two-thirds super-majority – which is common in other countries for a constitutional change of this magnitude.\nEven so, we are told that the people have spoken.\nLook at what we have allowed ourselves to become.\nIn a matter of months our public discourse has been consumed by vitriol and abuse. Hate crimes rose 40% in the aftermath of the referendum vote, and we do not yet know what forces our actual departure will unleash.\nIt is easy to dismiss views with which you disagree if you never actually listen to them at all. If you just dismiss the people who hold them as villains or enemies of the people.\nBut it is in those terms that we are being asked to rubber stamp a blank cheque for the Government to deliver the most extreme version of Brexit imaginable.\nWe are being asked to ignore the fact that leaving the European Union will saddle us with a £60 billion divorce bill.\nThe OBR has forecast that Brexit will cost us another £58 billion over the next 5 years. Where will these cuts fall? We’re not even supposed to ask.\nWe are not going to get tariff-free access to EU customers whilst rejecting free movement. That is not on the table.\nWe are not going to get a more favourable trading arrangement with Europe from outside the Single Market. That is a paradox.\nWe are not going to come to a full agreement with Europe within 2 years. Believing otherwise completely flies in the face of precedent and all evidence.\nExiting without a deal and falling back on World Trade Organisation rules is being talked about as if this is a good option. That is totally wrong. It would be an absolute disaster for this country.\nEven on the optimistic assumption that we can sign trade agreements all over the world, this will not even come close to making up for the loss of the single market.\nWe are facing a return to a hard border in Northern Ireland and a breakdown of the union with Scotland.\nWe are not reclaiming sovereignty, another promise that falls apart under any scrutiny. We are just transferring it behind the closed doors of negotiating rooms, where other countries will hold a gun to our heads.\nBut we are being asked to forget about all that.\nOur doctors are against Brexit because our health service will collapse without European staff.\nOur scientists are against Brexit because they will lose research grants and talented researchers.\nOur manufacturers are against it because they will lose tariff-free trade with our biggest market.\nOur financial services are against Brexit because they will lose their pass-porting rights.\nOur universities are against Brexit because they will lose funding, staff and students.\nOur exporters are against Brexit because if we leave the customs union they won’t be able to trade without goods being detained and checked at borders.\nBut why would we listen to these people – they are only the experts after all.\nWhat happens in the next two years will define the future of our nation for generations.\nIn everything we have heard so far – the soft Brexit, hard Brexit, clean Brexit, grey Brexit and the red, white and blue Brexit – the Government has shown very little understanding of the huge obstacles they must overcome in the next two years, and even less understanding of the devastating consequences of failure.\nWe have decided that we are leaving, but it is the EU nations that decide how we leave and what we end up with.\nArticle 50 is the start of a process, not the end, and this process will be out of our hands as soon as Article 50 is triggered.\nWhere could we end up in 2019? Out of the single market. Out of the customs union. No trade deal with Europe or anywhere else.\nOur only friend a President with a flagrant disregard for human rights. Do we really want to let ourselves become the 51st state of Trump’s America?\nWe shouldn’t fool ourselves.\nThis is not, and it never has been a debate about the economy. This has always been a debate about immigration.\nWe are staring down the barrel of a hard Brexit because immigration has been prioritised above all else – even the economy, jobs and living standards.\nDuring the campaign, we were sold the lie that we could cut immigration without hitting our economy.\nWe were sold the lie that immigrants come here and take more than they contribute.\nBetween 1995 and 2011 European immigrants made a net contribution of £4.4 billion to our public finances. In the same period our native population cost us £591 billion.\nEconomic migrants are educated at another country’s expense so they subsidise our public spending on the young, the sick and the elderly.\n78% of working age EU migrants are in work, compared to 74% of UK natives. The employment rate of migrants from the 8 countries that joined the EU in 2004 is over 80%.\nOur economy can’t exist without people coming here to do the jobs that people in this country either don’t want to do or don’t have the right skills to do.\nSo not only will our economy take a hit when we leave the Single Market to control immigration, reducing immigration itself will further hurt our economy and make us poorer.\nAnd another truth that the Leave campaign persuaded us to ignore. Last year more people arrived from outside the EU than from within the EU.\nWhen we go around signing new trade deals, countries will demand visas for their people in return.\nPeople have been told that immigration is going to disappear, but we will just be swapping EU immigration for non-EU immigration.\nThis is a voracious race to the bottom that will never end. And so when things go wrong, the backlash against migrants and minorities will be even worse.\nIt is almost half a century since a Member of this House, in a very different era, made these same warnings of “wives unable to obtain hospital beds in childbirth”, “children unable to obtain school places” and “homes and neighbourhoods changed beyond recognition”.\nHow far we have fallen when a black British Member of Parliament, of African and Caribbean descent, has to stand up and start quoting Enoch Powell.\nOn both sides of the Atlantic we can see the resurgence of far-right nationalism and nativist, xenophobic bigotry. Appeasement and compromise won’t work. It never has and it never will. We must meet it head on, before it’s too late.\nIt is the easy option to blame migrants who come here with skills instead of successive Governments – both Conservative and Labour – who have failed.\nFailed to educate our own to compete.\nFailed to build affordable housing.\nFailed to fund our public services.\nFailed to ensure that growth is felt outside of London and the South East.\nA hard Brexit won’t deal with any of the long-standing, structural problems highlighted by the Brexit vote. It will make them worse.\nThe real tragedy is that with Whitehall and Parliament so consumed with Brexit for the next 10 years, we will have no capacity to address these problems.\nLondon and the South East are the only regions where GDP per person is higher today than it was in 2007. Everywhere else, people are worse off than they were before the credit crunch.\nOur economy is an hour glass, with the middle section hollowed out.\nThe middle rungs of the ladder – the breadwinner jobs that paid enough to raise a family on have disappeared. We now only have an asset class and an under-class.\nPoverty is no longer an issue that afflicts the workless. More than half of all people who are in poverty – 7 and a half million in our country – are in a working family.\nReal wages have fallen by 5% since 2009. And at the same time, the average property owner in London makes more money per year from the increased value of their home than the average London salary.\nI will not take lectures about listening to left behind communities.\nI have seen two riots in a generation in Tottenham.\nMy constituents have borne the brunt of austerity since 2010, and it is they who will pay the price of a hard Brexit.\nChild poverty is at 40%. The council spends £20 million a year on bed and breakfasts just to keep families off the street.\nSo I will not betray my constituents by standing by and staying silent as this recklessness drives our economy off a cliff.\nMembers opposite have been dreaming of a low-tax, low-wage, low-regulation offshore tax haven for decades, and now they have it in their grasp they salivate at the thought of us becoming the new Singapore.\nI will not stand with them.\nIf we let the Prime Minister pursue this reckless course – this Brexit at any cost – we know that as always it will be the poor, the weak and the vulnerable who suffer.\nThe referendum was not simply the rebellion of working class Labour heartlands that has been portrayed.\n52% of Leave votes lived in the South of England. 59% were middle class. 58% of those who voted Conservative in 2015 voted Leave in 2016.\nColleagues on these benches must remember who the Labour Party represents – the very people and communities who will pay the price. This is not the time to stay silent or fall into line.\nHow can you walk into the voting lobby shoulder to shoulder with the party of Nigel Farage and the very people whose vision of society we all went into politics to oppose?\nAnd as for Members opposite, where are you? Where are your better instincts? Why have you rolled over and given in to the hard Brexiteers, who have always been on the fringes of your party but who have never, until now, been in the driving seat?\nThis is not a time to put self-interest or party interest ahead of the national interest. There is too much at stake.\nLet me finish by asking just one simple question, once asked by one of our most celebrated Parliamentarians.\n“Is it prudent, is it even possible, however much we might desire it, to turn our backs upon Europe?”\nWhen Churchill spoke those words, he was talking about appeasement and he was going very much against the prevailing wind. The same is true today.\nPatriotism requires more than blind faith. We must remember our history, our values, what we represent and what we stand for. Most of all, we should remember what we stand against.\nFor all of these reasons, and for the sake of the country that I love, I will be voting against the triggering of Article 50.”\nWhat a speech. My thanks to him and all the MPs who voted against the triggering of Article 50 for similar reasons, who put their conscience and patriotism before their career.",

  "https_europeanbritblog_wordpress_com_/https_europeanbritblog_wordpress_com_tag_erasmus/content_67.html": "Feel free to plagiarise my letter and write to your own MP.\nDear xxx,\nThe Prime Minister’s Brexit speech outlined what she wants to achieve in negotiations with the EU27 albeit with many idealistic aims rather than plans and in contrast with the Conservative Party Manifesto commitment to remain in the Single Market. Your Leader has demonstrated her wish to sacrifice jobs and business to satisfy the demands to control immigration. Yet as Home Secretary for six years, she had the opportunity to control immigration but chose not to. She could have applied the EU 2004 law whereby EU migrants must prove they have a job, are studying or have financial means to support themselves within three months of arrival. However, she knew that EU migrants actually earn the UK economy far more in net taxation than they cost, a message she is ignoring now to satisfy the right-wing Eurosceptics and constituencies where UKIP are chasing the Conservative vote. How shameful that she is protecting her own position and keeping her government in power to the detriment of the country’s future.\nI am glad that Mrs May has agreed to give Parliament a vote on the final destination but there must also be a vote by the people. This will include (a) all the 15-17 year olds who were too young to vote in 2016 but whose future will be affected and (b) must include UK citizens living in EU27. The outcome of these negotiations affects their rights as UK citizens too. As my MP, I ask you please to demand this vital democratic right.\nI am also pleased that Mrs May has just announced a White Paper on the bill to trigger Article 50 giving all MPs and Peers a chance for full debate and to table amendments. The government lost 80 days and a great deal of taxpayers’ money by choosing to challenge the High Court judgment but must not now rush either House with this vital step.\nAre our acquired rights as EU citizens about to be taken away?\nThe Leave campaign asserted that, in the event of the vote going in their favour, Article 70 of the little known Vienna Convention of 1969 would protect all those rights acquired by UK citizens during the UK’s 44 years of EEC/EC/EU membership.\nI do not believe that the vote to leave provides any mandate to take away our individual rights acquired over 44 years of the UK’s membership of the EEC/EU. Indeed, Lord Neuberger’s statement that “certain rights enjoyed by UK citizens will be changed” appears to be one of the principal reasons that the Supreme Court has ruled that Article 50 cannot be triggered without the approval of Parliament.\nWill “taking back control” mean a loss of acquired rights? The May Administration must answer these questions concerning the rights of UK citizens living in the UK and abroad. Here are a dozen initial questions:\n-\nPost Brexit, will UK citizens be able to study, live, work (employed or self-employed) and retire freely anywhere in EU27?\n-\nWill travelling to EU27 require UK citizens to join separate immigration queues and obtain visas?\n-\nWill UK citizens maintain access to a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) that currently enables them to receive health care free or at reduced cost at the point of use? The EHIC has reduced the cost of travel insurance. Health insurance is vital for UK citizens living in EU27.\n-\nWill UK citizens be able to shop and bring home goods from anywhere in the EU27 (subject to laws concerning illegal or restricted items) without paying tariffs or excise duties?\n-\nWill retired UK citizens in EU27 countries be able to continue living in their country of choice or will they need to reapply for residency and will their state pensions be protected, whether paid by the UK or an EU state?\n-\nWill children of UK citizens working and living in the EU27 still be able to attend local state schools and will secondary education qualifications gained by UK citizens in other EU countries still be recognised for access to UK universities?\n-\nWill children of UK citizens be allowed to attend low cost EU universities? Will they be allowed to remain in the EU27 after taking their degree(s)?\n-\nWill UK workers in the EU27 be subject to the requirements for obtaining a work permit if Freedom of Movement is no longer possible and will their professional and educational qualifications be recognised in the same way as they are today?\n-\nWill they be able to apply to become nationals of their chosen country and so hold dual nationality?\n-\nWill young UK citizens continue to benefit from the Erasmus student exchange programme, which currently allows UK university students to study or work abroad for between 3-12 months and receive free tuition and some living costs from the EU?\n-\nWill the government guarantee that the withdrawal from EU agencies such as Europol and Eurojust will not expose us to greater risks in the fight against serious international crime and terrorism? If so, how will this be done?\n-\nWill the government guarantee that the rights of safety and protection provided through our membership of agencies such as the following will not be impaired, if so, how will this be done?\n-\nEuropean Agency for Health and Safety at Work\n-\nEuropean Aviation Safety Agency\n-\nEuropean Food Safety Authority\n-\nEuropean Medicines Agency\n-\nEuropean Chemicals Agency\nFinally, Charles Goerens MEP proposed that UK citizens who do not wish to lose the rights of EU citizens be granted Associate EU Citizenship and I fully support this idea.",

  "https_europeanbritblog_wordpress_com_/https_europeanbritblog_wordpress_com_tag_brexit/content_45.html": "When Michael Gove, the pro-Brexit Justice Secretary, was told by Faisal Islam of Sky News that “the leaders of the US, India, China, Australia, every single one of our allies, the Bank of England, the IFS, IMF, the CBI, five former Nato secretary generals and the Chief Executive of the NHS” were all against Britain’s exit, the response was remarkable.\n“I think the people of this country have had enough of experts”.\nFaisal Islam was understandably dumbfounded by such a stupid statement from a very intelligent man.\nMichael Gove is jointly culpable for Brexit, for the sharp decline in the value of the Pound, the dramatic losses in our investments and pension funds and the fall in our credit rating. Now while some of these short term responses may be corrected in the short term, that does not help businesses today with higher cost for importing of materials and services, nor holiday makers who will have 8€ or 11 € less per £.\nIt was widely expected that Boris Johnson would be the clear favourite to stand as PM and Michael Gove would be his running mate but Gove’s wife, Sarah Vine, “accidentally” leaked an email, destined for him, to a member of the public advising him to be absolutely sure that Boris promised him a top job before lending his support. The next day, Gove, despite all his previous assurances since 2012 that he would not and could not stand as PM, went back on his word and stood for election. Boris responded by not standing.\nMichael Gove is not to be trusted. There is an expression, which is surprisingly from Gavin Esler in “A Scrupulous Man” and not Shakespeare, so often the author of our favourite expressions:\n“He who wields the knife rarely inherits the crown”.\nMichael Gove is one of the Gang of Three (Farage-Johnson-Gove) who duped the public with falsehoods regarding the information on which millions of people based their Remain/Leave vote. Although they thought the public would vote Remain, they are responsible for the constitutional mess that the country finds itself in and the knock-on effect to our European partners and indeed, the worldwide economy. Although there are suggestions that a Brexiteer should lead the country in negotiations post triggering Article 50, there is no way that Gove should be rewarded with the glittering prize. He deceived the country and our memories will not be short.\nFurthermore, with the reforms Michael Gove made as Education Secretary, he is widely hated by teachers and parents of children who will sit GCSE from 2017 onwards – including my son. If the Tories choose Gove as their leader, they are unlikely to win in a General Election. By all means Tories, choose the man with the bloody dagger.\nPS Does anyone else think he sounds like Michael McIntyre?",

Having optimism of negotiating good deals is all very well but it won’t happen in the time frame. Many Tory voters will be fine IN or OUT but I feel sorry for all the SMEs who have built up good businesses with EU businesses that support their families and the supply chain around them. So many face uncertainty now with possible closure and all because the government want to look after their supporters who will profit from new deals. The hard-up Northerners who were persuaded to vote Leave by the right wing tabloids have been duped by multi-millionaires like Daily Mail’s Paul Dacre and MP Jacob Rees-Mogg. It is they who will suffer financially, not the millionaires. So many industries need migrant workers. I could go on but won’t.\nVoting against Article 50 is not a lack of respect for the 37% minority of the population who actually voted for this monumental mistake. It is about saying, “I wholeheartedly believe this is wrong for the country now and in the future and I am prepared to stand by my conscience rather than blindly follow a leader for the sake of my career”.\nPeople complain about lying, opportunistic politicians so let’s congratulate these for their integrity.\nHistory will judge the spineless who will have to explain to future generations why they knowingly destroyed, or at least completely changed the direction, character and values of this nation for the worst and maybe split the Kingdom.\nLeave a comment",

  "https_europeanbritblog_wordpress_com_/https_europeanbritblog_wordpress_com/content_1.html": "Every now and then a politician brings tears to my eyes and this time it was David Lammy, Labour MP for Tottenham who explained why he would not be voting to trigger Article 50 and so disobey his party’s 3 line whip.\nYou can watch his speech here, or read it below.\nhttp://www.parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/fe6bc3c9-5d0b-4808-ba0b-8ce9c08475c1 starting at 19:42.\nOn Tuesday evening (31st January) I spoke in the Second Reading of the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill.\nMany members of this House have long believed that the United Kingdom’s interests would be best served outside of the European Union.\nThey campaigned passionately for what they believe in and in their view we must now leave the European Union – no ifs, no buts and no questions asked.\nIt would be unfair if I didn’t acknowledge that 52% of those who voted on June 23rd voted to Leave.\nThe Prime Minister says she wants to deliver a Brexit that works for all and a Brexit that unites our divided country.\nI too want to bring this country back together.\nMembers right across this House will have experienced just how divided the country has become in the months leading up to last June and in the months since.\nYoung and old. Graduates and non-graduates. The haves and the have nots. City dwellers and those who live in smaller towns and rural communities.\nUnprecedented, deep divisions of the kind I have not seen in my lifetime.\nBut we cannot bring the country back together if we pretend that the country has spoken with one united voice.\nPeople who voted to Leave voted for all sorts of reasons, many of which had absolutely nothing to do with the European Union.\nI knocked on doors all over the country, from Hornsey to Huddersfield, and a lot of the Brexit voters I spoke to were actually voting against David Cameron and the Conservative Government.\nSome voted for Leave to send a message to Westminster and register a protest vote.\nSome said they were fed up with public services stretched to breaking point.\nSome said they felt trapped and helpless so they voted for Leave because – as one voter put it to me – “well things can’t get any worse, can they?”\nSo when the Prime Minister speaks of “the will of the people”, her interpretation is frankly no clearer or more precise that anyone else’s.\nLet’s not pretend that the people have spoken, because not all of them have.\nIn fact only 27% of the people of this country voted to Leave. 13 million people didn’t vote. Another 7 million eligible voters weren’t registered. 1 million British expatriates weren’t allowed to vote.\n16 year olds were denied a say, even though it was their futures that were on the ballot paper.\nOnly 2 of the 4 nations that make up the United Kingdom voted to Leave. There was no quadruple lock.\nThere was no two-thirds super-majority – which is common in other countries for a constitutional change of this magnitude.\nEven so, we are told that the people have spoken.\nLook at what we have allowed ourselves to become.\nIn a matter of months our public discourse has been consumed by vitriol and abuse. Hate crimes rose 40% in the aftermath of the referendum vote, and we do not yet know what forces our actual departure will unleash.\nIt is easy to dismiss views with which you disagree if you never actually listen to them at all. If you just dismiss the people who hold them as villains or enemies of the people.\nBut it is in those terms that we are being asked to rubber stamp a blank cheque for the Government to deliver the most extreme version of Brexit imaginable.\nWe are being asked to ignore the fact that leaving the European Union will saddle us with a £60 billion divorce bill.\nThe OBR has forecast that Brexit will cost us another £58 billion over the next 5 years. Where will these cuts fall? We’re not even supposed to ask.\nWe are not going to get tariff-free access to EU customers whilst rejecting free movement. That is not on the table.\nWe are not going to get a more favourable trading arrangement with Europe from outside the Single Market. That is a paradox.\nWe are not going to come to a full agreement with Europe within 2 years. Believing otherwise completely flies in the face of precedent and all evidence.\nExiting without a deal and falling back on World Trade Organisation rules is being talked about as if this is a good option. That is totally wrong. It would be an absolute disaster for this country.\nEven on the optimistic assumption that we can sign trade agreements all over the world, this will not even come close to making up for the loss of the single market.\nWe are facing a return to a hard border in Northern Ireland and a breakdown of the union with Scotland.\nWe are not reclaiming sovereignty, another promise that falls apart under any scrutiny. We are just transferring it behind the closed doors of negotiating rooms, where other countries will hold a gun to our heads.\nBut we are being asked to forget about all that.\nOur doctors are against Brexit because our health service will collapse without European staff.\nOur scientists are against Brexit because they will lose research grants and talented researchers.\nOur manufacturers are against it because they will lose tariff-free trade with our biggest market.\nOur financial services are against Brexit because they will lose their pass-porting rights.\nOur universities are against Brexit because they will lose funding, staff and students.\nOur exporters are against Brexit because if we leave the customs union they won’t be able to trade without goods being detained and checked at borders.\nBut why would we listen to these people – they are only the experts after all.\nWhat happens in the next two years will define the future of our nation for generations.\nIn everything we have heard so far – the soft Brexit, hard Brexit, clean Brexit, grey Brexit and the red, white and blue Brexit – the Government has shown very little understanding of the huge obstacles they must overcome in the next two years, and even less understanding of the devastating consequences of failure.\nWe have decided that we are leaving, but it is the EU nations that decide how we leave and what we end up with.\nArticle 50 is the start of a process, not the end, and this process will be out of our hands as soon as Article 50 is triggered.\nWhere could we end up in 2019? Out of the single market. Out of the customs union. No trade deal with Europe or anywhere else.\nOur only friend a President with a flagrant disregard for human rights. Do we really want to let ourselves become the 51st state of Trump’s America?\nWe shouldn’t fool ourselves.\nThis is not, and it never has been a debate about the economy. This has always been a debate about immigration.\nWe are staring down the barrel of a hard Brexit because immigration has been prioritised above all else – even the economy, jobs and living standards.\nDuring the campaign, we were sold the lie that we could cut immigration without hitting our economy.\nWe were sold the lie that immigrants come here and take more than they contribute.\nBetween 1995 and 2011 European immigrants made a net contribution of £4.4 billion to our public finances. In the same period our native population cost us £591 billion.\nEconomic migrants are educated at another country’s expense so they subsidise our public spending on the young, the sick and the elderly.\n78% of working age EU migrants are in work, compared to 74% of UK natives. The employment rate of migrants from the 8 countries that joined the EU in 2004 is over 80%.\nOur economy can’t exist without people coming here to do the jobs that people in this country either don’t want to do or don’t have the right skills to do.\nSo not only will our economy take a hit when we leave the Single Market to control immigration, reducing immigration itself will further hurt our economy and make us poorer.\nAnd another truth that the Leave campaign persuaded us to ignore. Last year more people arrived from outside the EU than from within the EU.\nWhen we go around signing new trade deals, countries will demand visas for their people in return.\nPeople have been told that immigration is going to disappear, but we will just be swapping EU immigration for non-EU immigration.\nThis is a voracious race to the bottom that will never end. And so when things go wrong, the backlash against migrants and minorities will be even worse.\nIt is almost half a century since a Member of this House, in a very different era, made these same warnings of “wives unable to obtain hospital beds in childbirth”, “children unable to obtain school places” and “homes and neighbourhoods changed beyond recognition”.\nHow far we have fallen when a black British Member of Parliament, of African and Caribbean descent, has to stand up and start quoting Enoch Powell.\nOn both sides of the Atlantic we can see the resurgence of far-right nationalism and nativist, xenophobic bigotry. Appeasement and compromise won’t work. It never has and it never will. We must meet it head on, before it’s too late.\nIt is the easy option to blame migrants who come here with skills instead of successive Governments – both Conservative and Labour – who have failed.\nFailed to educate our own to compete.\nFailed to build affordable housing.\nFailed to fund our public services.\nFailed to ensure that growth is felt outside of London and the South East.\nA hard Brexit won’t deal with any of the long-standing, structural problems highlighted by the Brexit vote. It will make them worse.\nThe real tragedy is that with Whitehall and Parliament so consumed with Brexit for the next 10 years, we will have no capacity to address these problems.\nLondon and the South East are the only regions where GDP per person is higher today than it was in 2007. Everywhere else, people are worse off than they were before the credit crunch.\nOur economy is an hour glass, with the middle section hollowed out.\nThe middle rungs of the ladder – the breadwinner jobs that paid enough to raise a family on have disappeared. We now only have an asset class and an under-class.\nPoverty is no longer an issue that afflicts the workless. More than half of all people who are in poverty – 7 and a half million in our country – are in a working family.\nReal wages have fallen by 5% since 2009. And at the same time, the average property owner in London makes more money per year from the increased value of their home than the average London salary.\nI will not take lectures about listening to left behind communities.\nI have seen two riots in a generation in Tottenham.\nMy constituents have borne the brunt of austerity since 2010, and it is they who will pay the price of a hard Brexit.\nChild poverty is at 40%. The council spends £20 million a year on bed and breakfasts just to keep families off the street.\nSo I will not betray my constituents by standing by and staying silent as this recklessness drives our economy off a cliff.\nMembers opposite have been dreaming of a low-tax, low-wage, low-regulation offshore tax haven for decades, and now they have it in their grasp they salivate at the thought of us becoming the new Singapore.\nI will not stand with them.\nIf we let the Prime Minister pursue this reckless course – this Brexit at any cost – we know that as always it will be the poor, the weak and the vulnerable who suffer.\nThe referendum was not simply the rebellion of working class Labour heartlands that has been portrayed.\n52% of Leave votes lived in the South of England. 59% were middle class. 58% of those who voted Conservative in 2015 voted Leave in 2016.\nColleagues on these benches must remember who the Labour Party represents – the very people and communities who will pay the price. This is not the time to stay silent or fall into line.\nHow can you walk into the voting lobby shoulder to shoulder with the party of Nigel Farage and the very people whose vision of society we all went into politics to oppose?\nAnd as for Members opposite, where are you? Where are your better instincts? Why have you rolled over and given in to the hard Brexiteers, who have always been on the fringes of your party but who have never, until now, been in the driving seat?\nThis is not a time to put self-interest or party interest ahead of the national interest. There is too much at stake.\nLet me finish by asking just one simple question, once asked by one of our most celebrated Parliamentarians.\n“Is it prudent, is it even possible, however much we might desire it, to turn our backs upon Europe?”\nWhen Churchill spoke those words, he was talking about appeasement and he was going very much against the prevailing wind. The same is true today.\nPatriotism requires more than blind faith. We must remember our history, our values, what we represent and what we stand for. Most of all, we should remember what we stand against.\nFor all of these reasons, and for the sake of the country that I love, I will be voting against the triggering of Article 50.”\nWhat a speech. My thanks to him and all the MPs who voted against the triggering of Article 50 for similar reasons, who put their conscience and patriotism before their career.",

For me these should be core subjects, vital to engendering tolerance and multi-cultural co-habitation. When you decide that learning about prisms of light, non-ferrous metals and vectors is more important that understanding what other people think and believe, it is no surprise that 58% voted to Leave in Portsmouth and 62% in Havant.\nAll the tabloid newspapers supported Leave. They are easy to read with lots of photos and cost 20p-80p. Compare these to the intelligent press with reasoned discussions for £1-£2.40. The tabloids feed the sort of language which incites xenophobia and racism:\nDaily Express: “Migrants make mugs of us all”, “We must stop the migrant invasion”, “Britain must ban migrants” – Disgraceful.\nNo wonder we have heard stories this week of Polish children in school being told to go home, children who were born here!\nWhat is happening to our country? I am not sure that I recognise it any more.",

  "https_europeanbritblog_wordpress_com_/https_europeanbritblog_wordpress_com_tag_education-secretary/content_59.html": "When Michael Gove, the pro-Brexit Justice Secretary, was told by Faisal Islam of Sky News that “the leaders of the US, India, China, Australia, every single one of our allies, the Bank of England, the IFS, IMF, the CBI, five former Nato secretary generals and the Chief Executive of the NHS” were all against Britain’s exit, the response was remarkable.\n“I think the people of this country have had enough of experts”.\nFaisal Islam was understandably dumbfounded by such a stupid statement from a very intelligent man.\nMichael Gove is jointly culpable for Brexit, for the sharp decline in the value of the Pound, the dramatic losses in our investments and pension funds and the fall in our credit rating. Now while some of these short term responses may be corrected in the short term, that does not help businesses today with higher cost for importing of materials and services, nor holiday makers who will have 8€ or 11 € less per £.\nIt was widely expected that Boris Johnson would be the clear favourite to stand as PM and Michael Gove would be his running mate but Gove’s wife, Sarah Vine, “accidentally” leaked an email, destined for him, to a member of the public advising him to be absolutely sure that Boris promised him a top job before lending his support. The next day, Gove, despite all his previous assurances since 2012 that he would not and could not stand as PM, went back on his word and stood for election. Boris responded by not standing.\nMichael Gove is not to be trusted. There is an expression, which is surprisingly from Gavin Esler in “A Scrupulous Man” and not Shakespeare, so often the author of our favourite expressions:\n“He who wields the knife rarely inherits the crown”.\nMichael Gove is one of the Gang of Three (Farage-Johnson-Gove) who duped the public with falsehoods regarding the information on which millions of people based their Remain/Leave vote. Although they thought the public would vote Remain, they are responsible for the constitutional mess that the country finds itself in and the knock-on effect to our European partners and indeed, the worldwide economy. Although there are suggestions that a Brexiteer should lead the country in negotiations post triggering Article 50, there is no way that Gove should be rewarded with the glittering prize. He deceived the country and our memories will not be short.\nFurthermore, with the reforms Michael Gove made as Education Secretary, he is widely hated by teachers and parents of children who will sit GCSE from 2017 onwards – including my son. If the Tories choose Gove as their leader, they are unlikely to win in a General Election. By all means Tories, choose the man with the bloody dagger.\nPS Does anyone else think he sounds like Michael McIntyre?",

Graduates and non-graduates. The haves and the have nots. City dwellers and those who live in smaller towns and rural communities.\nUnprecedented, deep divisions of the kind I have not seen in my lifetime.\nBut we cannot bring the country back together if we pretend that the country has spoken with one united voice.\nPeople who voted to Leave voted for all sorts of reasons, many of which had absolutely nothing to do with the European Union.\nI knocked on doors all over the country, from Hornsey to Huddersfield, and a lot of the Brexit voters I spoke to were actually voting against David Cameron and the Conservative Government.\nSome voted for Leave to send a message to Westminster and register a protest vote.\nSome said they were fed up with public services stretched to breaking point.\nSome said they felt trapped and helpless so they voted for Leave because – as one voter put it to me – “well things can’t get any worse, can they?”\nSo when the Prime Minister speaks of “the will of the people”, her interpretation is frankly no clearer or more precise that anyone else’s.\nLet’s not pretend that the people have spoken, because not all of them have.\nIn fact only 27% of the people of this country voted to Leave. 13 million people didn’t vote. Another 7 million eligible voters weren’t registered. 1 million British expatriates weren’t allowed to vote.\n16 year olds were denied a say, even though it was their futures that were on the ballot paper.\nOnly 2 of the 4 nations that make up the United Kingdom voted to Leave. There was no quadruple lock.\nThere was no two-thirds super-majority – which is common in other countries for a constitutional change of this magnitude.\nEven so, we are told that the people have spoken.\nLook at what we have allowed ourselves to become.\nIn a matter of months our public discourse has been consumed by vitriol and abuse. Hate crimes rose 40% in the aftermath of the referendum vote, and we do not yet know what forces our actual departure will unleash.\nIt is easy to dismiss views with which you disagree if you never actually listen to them at all. If you just dismiss the people who hold them as villains or enemies of the people.\nBut it is in those terms that we are being asked to rubber stamp a blank cheque for the Government to deliver the most extreme version of Brexit imaginable.\nWe are being asked to ignore the fact that leaving the European Union will saddle us with a £60 billion divorce bill.\nThe OBR has forecast that Brexit will cost us another £58 billion over the next 5 years. Where will these cuts fall? We’re not even supposed to ask.\nWe are not going to get tariff-free access to EU customers whilst rejecting free movement. That is not on the table.\nWe are not going to get a more favourable trading arrangement with Europe from outside the Single Market. That is a paradox.\nWe are not going to come to a full agreement with Europe within 2 years. Believing otherwise completely flies in the face of precedent and all evidence.\nExiting without a deal and falling back on World Trade Organisation rules is being talked about as if this is a good option. That is totally wrong. It would be an absolute disaster for this country.\nEven on the optimistic assumption that we can sign trade agreements all over the world, this will not even come close to making up for the loss of the single market.\nWe are facing a return to a hard border in Northern Ireland and a breakdown of the union with Scotland.\nWe are not reclaiming sovereignty, another promise that falls apart under any scrutiny. We are just transferring it behind the closed doors of negotiating rooms, where other countries will hold a gun to our heads.\nBut we are being asked to forget about all that.\nOur doctors are against Brexit because our health service will collapse without European staff.\nOur scientists are against Brexit because they will lose research grants and talented researchers.\nOur manufacturers are against it because they will lose tariff-free trade with our biggest market.\nOur financial services are against Brexit because they will lose their pass-porting rights.\nOur universities are against Brexit because they will lose funding, staff and students.\nOur exporters are against Brexit because if we leave the customs union they won’t be able to trade without goods being detained and checked at borders.\nBut why would we listen to these people – they are only the experts after all.\nWhat happens in the next two years will define the future of our nation for generations.\nIn everything we have heard so far – the soft Brexit, hard Brexit, clean Brexit, grey Brexit and the red, white and blue Brexit – the Government has shown very little understanding of the huge obstacles they must overcome in the next two years, and even less understanding of the devastating consequences of failure.\nWe have decided that we are leaving, but it is the EU nations that decide how we leave and what we end up with.\nArticle 50 is the start of a process, not the end, and this process will be out of our hands as soon as Article 50 is triggered.\nWhere could we end up in 2019? Out of the single market. Out of the customs union. No trade deal with Europe or anywhere else.\nOur only friend a President with a flagrant disregard for human rights. Do we really want to let ourselves become the 51st state of Trump’s America?\nWe shouldn’t fool ourselves.\nThis is not, and it never has been a debate about the economy. This has always been a debate about immigration.\nWe are staring down the barrel of a hard Brexit because immigration has been prioritised above all else – even the economy, jobs and living standards.\nDuring the campaign, we were sold the lie that we could cut immigration without hitting our economy.\nWe were sold the lie that immigrants come here and take more than they contribute.\nBetween 1995 and 2011 European immigrants made a net contribution of £4.4 billion to our public finances. In the same period our native population cost us £591 billion.\nEconomic migrants are educated at another country’s expense so they subsidise our public spending on the young, the sick and the elderly.\n78% of working age EU migrants are in work, compared to 74% of UK natives. The employment rate of migrants from the 8 countries that joined the EU in 2004 is over 80%.\nOur economy can’t exist without people coming here to do the jobs that people in this country either don’t want to do or don’t have the right skills to do.\nSo not only will our economy take a hit when we leave the Single Market to control immigration, reducing immigration itself will further hurt our economy and make us poorer.\nAnd another truth that the Leave campaign persuaded us to ignore. Last year more people arrived from outside the EU than from within the EU.\nWhen we go around signing new trade deals, countries will demand visas for their people in return.\nPeople have been told that immigration is going to disappear, but we will just be swapping EU immigration for non-EU immigration.\nThis is a voracious race to the bottom that will never end. And so when things go wrong, the backlash against migrants and minorities will be even worse.\nIt is almost half a century since a Member of this House, in a very different era, made these same warnings of “wives unable to obtain hospital beds in childbirth”, “children unable to obtain school places” and “homes and neighbourhoods changed beyond recognition”.\nHow far we have fallen when a black British Member of Parliament, of African and Caribbean descent, has to stand up and start quoting Enoch Powell.\nOn both sides of the Atlantic we can see the resurgence of far-right nationalism and nativist, xenophobic bigotry. Appeasement and compromise won’t work. It never has and it never will. We must meet it head on, before it’s too late.\nIt is the easy option to blame migrants who come here with skills instead of successive Governments – both Conservative and Labour – who have failed.\nFailed to educate our own to compete.\nFailed to build affordable housing.\nFailed to fund our public services.\nFailed to ensure that growth is felt outside of London and the South East.\nA hard Brexit won’t deal with any of the long-standing, structural problems highlighted by the Brexit vote. It will make them worse.\nThe real tragedy is that with Whitehall and Parliament so consumed with Brexit for the next 10 years, we will have no capacity to address these problems.\nLondon and the South East are the only regions where GDP per person is higher today than it was in 2007. Everywhere else, people are worse off than they were before the credit crunch.\nOur economy is an hour glass, with the middle section hollowed out.\nThe middle rungs of the ladder – the breadwinner jobs that paid enough to raise a family on have disappeared. We now only have an asset class and an under-class.\nPoverty is no longer an issue that afflicts the workless. More than half of all people who are in poverty – 7 and a half million in our country – are in a working family.\nReal wages have fallen by 5% since 2009. And at the same time, the average property owner in London makes more money per year from the increased value of their home than the average London salary.\nI will not take lectures about listening to left behind communities.\nI have seen two riots in a generation in Tottenham.\nMy constituents have borne the brunt of austerity since 2010, and it is they who will pay the price of a hard Brexit.\nChild poverty is at 40%. The council spends £20 million a year on bed and breakfasts just to keep families off the street.\nSo I will not betray my constituents by standing by and staying silent as this recklessness drives our economy off a cliff.\nMembers opposite have been dreaming of a low-tax, low-wage, low-regulation offshore tax haven for decades, and now they have it in their grasp they salivate at the thought of us becoming the new Singapore.\nI will not stand with them.\nIf we let the Prime Minister pursue this reckless course – this Brexit at any cost – we know that as always it will be the poor, the weak and the vulnerable who suffer.\nThe referendum was not simply the rebellion of working class Labour heartlands that has been portrayed.\n52% of Leave votes lived in the South of England. 59% were middle class. 58% of those who voted Conservative in 2015 voted Leave in 2016.\nColleagues on these benches must remember who the Labour Party represents – the very people and communities who will pay the price. This is not the time to stay silent or fall into line.\nHow can you walk into the voting lobby shoulder to shoulder with the party of Nigel Farage and the very people whose vision of society we all went into politics to oppose?\nAnd as for Members opposite, where are you? Where are your better instincts? Why have you rolled over and given in to the hard Brexiteers, who have always been on the fringes of your party but who have never, until now, been in the driving seat?\nThis is not a time to put self-interest or party interest ahead of the national interest. There is too much at stake.\nLet me finish by asking just one simple question, once asked by one of our most celebrated Parliamentarians.\n“Is it prudent, is it even possible, however much we might desire it, to turn our backs upon Europe?”\nWhen Churchill spoke those words, he was talking about appeasement and he was going very much against the prevailing wind. The same is true today.\nPatriotism requires more than blind faith. We must remember our history, our values, what we represent and what we stand for. Most of all, we should remember what we stand against.\nFor all of these reasons, and for the sake of the country that I love, I will be voting against the triggering of Article 50.”\nWhat a speech. My thanks to him and all the MPs who voted against the triggering of Article 50 for similar reasons, who put their conscience and patriotism before their career.",

  "https_europeanbritblog_wordpress_com_/https_europeanbritblog_wordpress_com_tag_immigration/content_53.html": "Having lived and worked in two other EU countries for 16 years, and bothered to learn four other European languages, I have a different outlook to many Brits. I hold a long term, bigger picture view of Europe which is definitely about being stronger together and not about finding differences or reasons to stand apart. Just as in any relationship, look for what works then focus on improving the rest. Don’t just walk away.\nI know the EU has problems as you would expect of an organisation of 28 different nationalities, cultures, languages, ways of working and inevitable bureaucracy. After 58 years of existence since formation in 1958 and having grown from 6 to 28 countries, who would expect different?\nOn the plus side, we are the largest economic trading block in the world with a population of over 500 million and most countries share a common currency, the Euro . We have achieved peace throughout Europe since two horrendous World Wars which started in Europe. Twelve countries were formerly behind the Iron Curtain . It is quite astonishing what has been achieved. I prefer to focus on the positive.\nUnfortunately, the UK media, at least the populist media, has been negative portraying the EU as a cash-sucking machine rather than a source of inward investment. Rarely are we told of the specific investments in eg infrastructure which are positively announced with a large EU flag on the Continent. It is unbelievable how many people still believe that EU migrants are to blame for most of the ills in our economy, from NHS, housing and education through jobs rather than the honest fact that EU migrants bring a positive benefit to our country to the tune of £20 billion in net taxation receipts. There are many reasons why our country is one of the most overcrowded in Europe and why the NHS always seems to be in crisis but these are nothing to do with EU migrants and more a result of policies from successive governments. On the contrary, I value their contribution to our economy, our rich multicultural society and particularly their huge presence within the NHS at all levels. Did you know there are Italian doctors working in various aspects of mental health services which is an area severely underfunded by this government?\nBrexit focused largely on two false promises which they know they cannot fulfil ie:\n- Saying the UK contribution to the EU is £350 million a week (false figure) and this saving would be spent on the NHS. They now admit this figure is wrong and that money cannot go to the NHS.\n- Saying they would cut immigration. They have admitted they have no plans for how to cut immigration.\nThe Brexit campaign lied to the people. They portrayed the European Union in a very negative way instead of a balanced look at the good and areas for possible reform.",

Graduates and non-graduates. The haves and the have nots. City dwellers and those who live in smaller towns and rural communities.\nUnprecedented, deep divisions of the kind I have not seen in my lifetime.\nBut we cannot bring the country back together if we pretend that the country has spoken with one united voice.\nPeople who voted to Leave voted for all sorts of reasons, many of which had absolutely nothing to do with the European Union.\nI knocked on doors all over the country, from Hornsey to Huddersfield, and a lot of the Brexit voters I spoke to were actually voting against David Cameron and the Conservative Government.\nSome voted for Leave to send a message to Westminster and register a protest vote.\nSome said they were fed up with public services stretched to breaking point.\nSome said they felt trapped and helpless so they voted for Leave because – as one voter put it to me – “well things can’t get any worse, can they?”\nSo when the Prime Minister speaks of “the will of the people”, her interpretation is frankly no clearer or more precise that anyone else’s.\nLet’s not pretend that the people have spoken, because not all of them have.\nIn fact only 27% of the people of this country voted to Leave. 13 million people didn’t vote. Another 7 million eligible voters weren’t registered. 1 million British expatriates weren’t allowed to vote.\n16 year olds were denied a say, even though it was their futures that were on the ballot paper.\nOnly 2 of the 4 nations that make up the United Kingdom voted to Leave. There was no quadruple lock.\nThere was no two-thirds super-majority – which is common in other countries for a constitutional change of this magnitude.\nEven so, we are told that the people have spoken.\nLook at what we have allowed ourselves to become.\nIn a matter of months our public discourse has been consumed by vitriol and abuse. Hate crimes rose 40% in the aftermath of the referendum vote, and we do not yet know what forces our actual departure will unleash.\nIt is easy to dismiss views with which you disagree if you never actually listen to them at all. If you just dismiss the people who hold them as villains or enemies of the people.\nBut it is in those terms that we are being asked to rubber stamp a blank cheque for the Government to deliver the most extreme version of Brexit imaginable.\nWe are being asked to ignore the fact that leaving the European Union will saddle us with a £60 billion divorce bill.\nThe OBR has forecast that Brexit will cost us another £58 billion over the next 5 years. Where will these cuts fall? We’re not even supposed to ask.\nWe are not going to get tariff-free access to EU customers whilst rejecting free movement. That is not on the table.\nWe are not going to get a more favourable trading arrangement with Europe from outside the Single Market. That is a paradox.\nWe are not going to come to a full agreement with Europe within 2 years. Believing otherwise completely flies in the face of precedent and all evidence.\nExiting without a deal and falling back on World Trade Organisation rules is being talked about as if this is a good option. That is totally wrong. It would be an absolute disaster for this country.\nEven on the optimistic assumption that we can sign trade agreements all over the world, this will not even come close to making up for the loss of the single market.\nWe are facing a return to a hard border in Northern Ireland and a breakdown of the union with Scotland.\nWe are not reclaiming sovereignty, another promise that falls apart under any scrutiny.

  "https_europeanbritblog_wordpress_com_/https_europeanbritblog_wordpress_com_tag_george-osbourne/content_27.html": "Since we woke up to the dreadful news that somehow Britain had voted to Leave the EU, life has not been the same and I wonder whether it ever will be. I still feel dazed, in shock and so, so upset. I am literally heartbroken.\nLast Friday, the PM who had called this referendum, David Cameron, resigned. I was angry with him at the time for walking out, abandoning us to the mess his decision had caused. Since then I have watched him, the statesman that he is, doing his best to lead Parliament and find the best solution for the country he loves. I know that inside he too is broken.\nThis was never meant to happen. Cameron wanted to appease the Eurosceptic right-wingers in his party but somehow the scripts were mixed up. We should have shown the arrogant Nigel Farage that whilst he has his supporters, this country is not his to overrun with his racist and rude opinions. Farage on his own was not a votes winner. He needed support to spearhead the campaign. In that he found Boris Johnson, the Etonian boy groomed to be a future PM, just waiting in the wings after his eight years as Mayor of London. Now Boris is clever and he realised that fellow Etonian Cameron would not have the support of the masses. He saw this as his chance to walk triumphantly into No.10. Boris does not really want us to leave the EU, he was pro-Europe in earlier speeches, indeed in one he even said how he could not wait for the “great moment” when the two halves of the Roman Empire “are at last reunited in an expanded European Union” in a documentary he made for the BBC.\nYet tonight, Boris Johnson is in disgrace, licking his wounds and confirmed as not standing in the Tory party leadership contest. For the first time in a week I laughed, really laughed. The main who lied and change his support as part of his plan to win the top job has been exposed as a career politician who even put his country to ransom for his ambitions. This is one holy Eton Mess.\nI tweeted that we should take him to the Tower of London, via Traitors Gate and hang him.\nI have always liked Boris, who doesn’t with his incredible charisma? But this man will go down in history as the man who caused a constitutional crisis, lost billions of our wealth and plunged the UK and indeed the world into uncertainty. Confidence is falling and we could fall into recession.\nGeorge Osbourne, our Chancellor, was on target to achieve his goal of wiping out our budget deficit. All his work will have been wiped out by this most contemptuous of men, Boris Johnson. Osbourne too was expected to stand in the leadership but decided that he was not the man to bring unity.\nBoris’s side-kick in the Leave campaign, Michael Gove, who was supposed to back him in the hope of one of the top jobs, possibly Chancellor, has stabbed him in the back , declared Boris unfit to lead and offered himself into the leadership battle. This is the man who said in 2012, that he could not and would not stand for PM.\nThen there is Jeremy Corbyn, the nice Marxist who calls himself the Labour Leader. 172 to 40 of his MPs declared no confidence in him after nearly all of his Shadow Cabinet resigned and yet he sits there stubbornly, saying he has the mandate of his party members. That may be the case but in Parliament his job is to provide effective leadership of the Opposition and that he is failing to do. In fact today Nicola Sturgeon, leader of the Scottish Nationalist Party, said that the SNP should now take on the mantle of the Opposition as they are clearly united.\nAmidst all this, Tim Farron, leader of the Liberal Democrats, has spoken of his heartbreak but said we must seek a future for the UK within the EU. He has made UK’s membership of the EU the top policy for the party manifesto and is building strength in the party for the autumn General Election which many believe will come. Since Friday morning, 12,000 new members have joined the party no doubt seeking for a way to remain in the EU and looking to Tim to find a way. He says if we must leave, then we need to find a new model and he believes the Norwegian one to be the best although it will cost us more to achieve the same as we already have. That is what the Remain campaign kept saying when people talked of Norway, Switzerland, Iceland and other one foot in models without full membership.\nIt has been a long week but I think tonight I might sleep more soundly knowing that Boris has had his just reward.",

British people don’t like change and when faced with the stark choice, “Do you think that Britain should remain a member of the European Union or Leave?”, chances are people would quietly vote to Remain.\nSomething went wrong. Now we are looking at dismay in strangers wondering which way they voted. We are told that the older generation predominantly voted to Leave whilst 75% of the 18-25 year olds voted to stay. We hear that many Brexit supporters only wanted a protest vote, to oust Cameron, but they never meant to cause Britain’s exit from the EU. Brexit has created a crisis. Our Prime Minister, David Cameron, resigned within hours to take effect in October and the main Vote Leave protagonist, Boris Johnson, is tipped to take over. At first I thought Cameron was spineless to resign but on reflection, Boris caused this mess so let him sort it out. His campaign was based on lies which they now accept cannot be fulfilled.\nI personally have experienced the stages of grief: shock, denial, anger but not acceptance. Acceptance to me would mean accepting defeat. I feel I must do something. I had already been campaigning on Facebook and Twitter so I continued to post and tweet. I don’t want to drive my friends mad so thought it was time to move to a blog. Here I am.\nLeave a comment",

Graduates and non-graduates. The haves and the have nots. City dwellers and those who live in smaller towns and rural communities.\nUnprecedented, deep divisions of the kind I have not seen in my lifetime.\nBut we cannot bring the country back together if we pretend that the country has spoken with one united voice.\nPeople who voted to Leave voted for all sorts of reasons, many of which had absolutely nothing to do with the European Union.\nI knocked on doors all over the country, from Hornsey to Huddersfield, and a lot of the Brexit voters I spoke to were actually voting against David Cameron and the Conservative Government.\nSome voted for Leave to send a message to Westminster and register a protest vote.\nSome said they were fed up with public services stretched to breaking point.\nSome said they felt trapped and helpless so they voted for Leave because – as one voter put it to me – “well things can’t get any worse, can they?”\nSo when the Prime Minister speaks of “the will of the people”, her interpretation is frankly no clearer or more precise that anyone else’s.\nLet’s not pretend that the people have spoken, because not all of them have.\nIn fact only 27% of the people of this country voted to Leave. 13 million people didn’t vote. Another 7 million eligible voters weren’t registered. 1 million British expatriates weren’t allowed to vote.\n16 year olds were denied a say, even though it was their futures that were on the ballot paper.\nOnly 2 of the 4 nations that make up the United Kingdom voted to Leave. There was no quadruple lock.\nThere was no two-thirds super-majority – which is common in other countries for a constitutional change of this magnitude.\nEven so, we are told that the people have spoken.\nLook at what we have allowed ourselves to become.\nIn a matter of months our public discourse has been consumed by vitriol and abuse. Hate crimes rose 40% in the aftermath of the referendum vote, and we do not yet know what forces our actual departure will unleash.\nIt is easy to dismiss views with which you disagree if you never actually listen to them at all. If you just dismiss the people who hold them as villains or enemies of the people.\nBut it is in those terms that we are being asked to rubber stamp a blank cheque for the Government to deliver the most extreme version of Brexit imaginable.\nWe are being asked to ignore the fact that leaving the European Union will saddle us with a £60 billion divorce bill.\nThe OBR has forecast that Brexit will cost us another £58 billion over the next 5 years. Where will these cuts fall? We’re not even supposed to ask.\nWe are not going to get tariff-free access to EU customers whilst rejecting free movement. That is not on the table.\nWe are not going to get a more favourable trading arrangement with Europe from outside the Single Market. That is a paradox.\nWe are not going to come to a full agreement with Europe within 2 years. Believing otherwise completely flies in the face of precedent and all evidence.\nExiting without a deal and falling back on World Trade Organisation rules is being talked about as if this is a good option. That is totally wrong. It would be an absolute disaster for this country.\nEven on the optimistic assumption that we can sign trade agreements all over the world, this will not even come close to making up for the loss of the single market.\nWe are facing a return to a hard border in Northern Ireland and a breakdown of the union with Scotland.\nWe are not reclaiming sovereignty, another promise that falls apart under any scrutiny. We are just transferring it behind the closed doors of negotiating rooms, where other countries will hold a gun to our heads.\nBut we are being asked to forget about all that.\nOur doctors are against Brexit because our health service will collapse without European staff.\nOur scientists are against Brexit because they will lose research grants and talented researchers.\nOur manufacturers are against it because they will lose tariff-free trade with our biggest market.\nOur financial services are against Brexit because they will lose their pass-porting rights.\nOur universities are against Brexit because they will lose funding, staff and students.\nOur exporters are against Brexit because if we leave the customs union they won’t be able to trade without goods being detained and checked at borders.\nBut why would we listen to these people – they are only the experts after all.\nWhat happens in the next two years will define the future of our nation for generations.\nIn everything we have heard so far – the soft Brexit, hard Brexit, clean Brexit, grey Brexit and the red, white and blue Brexit – the Government has shown very little understanding of the huge obstacles they must overcome in the next two years, and even less understanding of the devastating consequences of failure.\nWe have decided that we are leaving, but it is the EU nations that decide how we leave and what we end up with.\nArticle 50 is the start of a process, not the end, and this process will be out of our hands as soon as Article 50 is triggered.\nWhere could we end up in 2019? Out of the single market. Out of the customs union. No trade deal with Europe or anywhere else.\nOur only friend a President with a flagrant disregard for human rights. Do we really want to let ourselves become the 51st state of Trump’s America?\nWe shouldn’t fool ourselves.\nThis is not, and it never has been a debate about the economy. This has always been a debate about immigration.\nWe are staring down the barrel of a hard Brexit because immigration has been prioritised above all else – even the economy, jobs and living standards.\nDuring the campaign, we were sold the lie that we could cut immigration without hitting our economy.\nWe were sold the lie that immigrants come here and take more than they contribute.\nBetween 1995 and 2011 European immigrants made a net contribution of £4.4 billion to our public finances. In the same period our native population cost us £591 billion.\nEconomic migrants are educated at another country’s expense so they subsidise our public spending on the young, the sick and the elderly.\n78% of working age EU migrants are in work, compared to 74% of UK natives. The employment rate of migrants from the 8 countries that joined the EU in 2004 is over 80%.\nOur economy can’t exist without people coming here to do the jobs that people in this country either don’t want to do or don’t have the right skills to do.\nSo not only will our economy take a hit when we leave the Single Market to control immigration, reducing immigration itself will further hurt our economy and make us poorer.\nAnd another truth that the Leave campaign persuaded us to ignore. Last year more people arrived from outside the EU than from within the EU.\nWhen we go around signing new trade deals, countries will demand visas for their people in return.\nPeople have been told that immigration is going to disappear, but we will just be swapping EU immigration for non-EU immigration.\nThis is a voracious race to the bottom that will never end. And so when things go wrong, the backlash against migrants and minorities will be even worse.\nIt is almost half a century since a Member of this House, in a very different era, made these same warnings of “wives unable to obtain hospital beds in childbirth”, “children unable to obtain school places” and “homes and neighbourhoods changed beyond recognition”.\nHow far we have fallen when a black British Member of Parliament, of African and Caribbean descent, has to stand up and start quoting Enoch Powell.\nOn both sides of the Atlantic we can see the resurgence of far-right nationalism and nativist, xenophobic bigotry. Appeasement and compromise won’t work. It never has and it never will. We must meet it head on, before it’s too late.\nIt is the easy option to blame migrants who come here with skills instead of successive Governments – both Conservative and Labour – who have failed.\nFailed to educate our own to compete.\nFailed to build affordable housing.\nFailed to fund our public services.\nFailed to ensure that growth is felt outside of London and the South East.\nA hard Brexit won’t deal with any of the long-standing, structural problems highlighted by the Brexit vote. It will make them worse.\nThe real tragedy is that with Whitehall and Parliament so consumed with Brexit for the next 10 years, we will have no capacity to address these problems.\nLondon and the South East are the only regions where GDP per person is higher today than it was in 2007. Everywhere else, people are worse off than they were before the credit crunch.\nOur economy is an hour glass, with the middle section hollowed out.\nThe middle rungs of the ladder – the breadwinner jobs that paid enough to raise a family on have disappeared. We now only have an asset class and an under-class.\nPoverty is no longer an issue that afflicts the workless. More than half of all people who are in poverty – 7 and a half million in our country – are in a working family.\nReal wages have fallen by 5% since 2009. And at the same time, the average property owner in London makes more money per year from the increased value of their home than the average London salary.\nI will not take lectures about listening to left behind communities.\nI have seen two riots in a generation in Tottenham.\nMy constituents have borne the brunt of austerity since 2010, and it is they who will pay the price of a hard Brexit.\nChild poverty is at 40%. The council spends £20 million a year on bed and breakfasts just to keep families off the street.\nSo I will not betray my constituents by standing by and staying silent as this recklessness drives our economy off a cliff.\nMembers opposite have been dreaming of a low-tax, low-wage, low-regulation offshore tax haven for decades, and now they have it in their grasp they salivate at the thought of us becoming the new Singapore.\nI will not stand with them.\nIf we let the Prime Minister pursue this reckless course – this Brexit at any cost – we know that as always it will be the poor, the weak and the vulnerable who suffer.\nThe referendum was not simply the rebellion of working class Labour heartlands that has been portrayed.\n52% of Leave votes lived in the South of England. 59% were middle class. 58% of those who voted Conservative in 2015 voted Leave in 2016.\nColleagues on these benches must remember who the Labour Party represents – the very people and communities who will pay the price. This is not the time to stay silent or fall into line.\nHow can you walk into the voting lobby shoulder to shoulder with the party of Nigel Farage and the very people whose vision of society we all went into politics to oppose?\nAnd as for Members opposite, where are you? Where are your better instincts? Why have you rolled over and given in to the hard Brexiteers, who have always been on the fringes of your party but who have never, until now, been in the driving seat?\nThis is not a time to put self-interest or party interest ahead of the national interest. There is too much at stake.\nLet me finish by asking just one simple question, once asked by one of our most celebrated Parliamentarians.\n“Is it prudent, is it even possible, however much we might desire it, to turn our backs upon Europe?”\nWhen Churchill spoke those words, he was talking about appeasement and he was going very much against the prevailing wind. The same is true today.\nPatriotism requires more than blind faith. We must remember our history, our values, what we represent and what we stand for. Most of all, we should remember what we stand against.\nFor all of these reasons, and for the sake of the country that I love, I will be voting against the triggering of Article 50.”\nWhat a speech. My thanks to him and all the MPs who voted against the triggering of Article 50 for similar reasons, who put their conscience and patriotism before their career.",

(source:Wikipedia)\nConsider:\n- The City of London’s contribution to the UK’s national income (or Gross Value Added, GVA) is estimated at is estimated at £45bn in 2014, or 3%, while London accounts for £334bn or 22% of the UK’s GVA. Source: Centre for Cities and Cambridge Econometrics, June 2015\n- There are over 1,400 financial services firms in the UK that are majority foreign-owned, from around 80 countries.Overseas owned companies represent 46% of all financial services groups worth in excess of £100m. This is nearly three times larger than any other sector of the market and demonstrates the continued international nature of UK financial services.

Europol – shares policing intelligence\n2. Eurojust – coordinates investigation and persecution of serious crime and terrorism\n3. European Medicines Agency – regulates quality, safety and provision of medicines across EU (your life might depend on one of these) and 6 months ahead of Canada and Oz\n4. European Aviation Safety Agency – self-explanatory\n5. European Food Safety Agency – eg USA wash chickens in chlorinated water and inject beef with growth hormones which are not allowed in Europe\nWhatever made you vote Leave, there are plenty more valid reasons to vote Remain. Write to your MP before it’s too late. Ask for assurances that this government will not leave us out in the cold when we currently enjoy so much protection.",

She now knows this was a blatant lie and feels disgraced at voting the way she did. She fully supports a multi-cultural society, indeed her daughter is dating a black guy.\nMaking this vote about immigration was a Fascist ticket and I too believe that the vast majority are more tolerant and inclusive. Yet there have been over 400 cases of race crime since the result, up from the usual 60-80 per week. The rise of UKIP has been ugly. Unfortunately, my 15 year old son tells me what some of his classmates believe so they must be fed this filth by their chav parents with two council estates within the catchment area. The teachers have a hard job teaching tolerance and inclusion within a very small window of time on a crowded timetable.\nMichael Gove, as Education Secretary, removed GCSE Psychology and Sociology because apparently teaching teenagers about people and society is not as important as STEM subjects. Yes, STEM subjects are important but we do not all need to know the details to live successfully in society as adults. Teaching comparative religions and morals in Ethics & Philosophy has also been sidelined in my son’s school and history is optional post 14. For me these should be core subjects, vital to engendering tolerance and multi-cultural co-habitation. When you decide that learning about prisms of light, non-ferrous metals and vectors is more important that understanding what other people think and believe, it is no surprise that 58% voted to Leave in Portsmouth and 62% in Havant.\nAll the tabloid newspapers supported Leave. They are easy to read with lots of photos and cost 20p-80p. Compare these to the intelligent press with reasoned discussions for £1-£2.40. The tabloids feed the sort of language which incites xenophobia and racism:\nDaily Express: “Migrants make mugs of us all”, “We must stop the migrant invasion”, “Britain must ban migrants” – Disgraceful.\nNo wonder we have heard stories this week of Polish children in school being told to go home, children who were born here!\nWhat is happening to our country?

I hold a long term, bigger picture view of Europe which is definitely about being stronger together and not about finding differences or reasons to stand apart. Just as in any relationship, look for what works then focus on improving the rest. Don’t just walk away.\nI know the EU has problems as you would expect of an organisation of 28 different nationalities, cultures, languages, ways of working and inevitable bureaucracy. After 58 years of existence since formation in 1958 and having grown from 6 to 28 countries, who would expect different?\nOn the plus side, we are the largest economic trading block in the world with a population of over 500 million and most countries share a common currency, the Euro . We have achieved peace throughout Europe since two horrendous World Wars which started in Europe. Twelve countries were formerly behind the Iron Curtain . It is quite astonishing what has been achieved. I prefer to focus on the positive.\nUnfortunately, the UK media, at least the populist media, has been negative portraying the EU as a cash-sucking machine rather than a source of inward investment. Rarely are we told of the specific investments in eg infrastructure which are positively announced with a large EU flag on the Continent. It is unbelievable how many people still believe that EU migrants are to blame for most of the ills in our economy, from NHS, housing and education through jobs rather than the honest fact that EU migrants bring a positive benefit to our country to the tune of £20 billion in net taxation receipts. There are many reasons why our country is one of the most overcrowded in Europe and why the NHS always seems to be in crisis but these are nothing to do with EU migrants and more a result of policies from successive governments. On the contrary, I value their contribution to our economy, our rich multicultural society and particularly their huge presence within the NHS at all levels. Did you know there are Italian doctors working in various aspects of mental health services which is an area severely underfunded by this government?\nBrexit focused largely on two false promises which they know they cannot fulfil ie:\n- Saying the UK contribution to the EU is £350 million a week (false figure) and this saving would be spent on the NHS. They now admit this figure is wrong and that money cannot go to the NHS.\n- Saying they would cut immigration. They have admitted they have no plans for how to cut immigration.\nThe Brexit campaign lied to the people. They portrayed the European Union in a very negative way instead of a balanced look at the good and areas for possible reform.\nLeave a comment",
  "https_europeanbritblog_wordpress_com_/https_europeanbritblog_wordpress_com_tag_article-70-of-vienna-convention-1969/content_8.html": "Feel free to plagiarise my letter and write to your own MP.\nDear xxx,\nThe Prime Minister’s Brexit speech outlined what she wants to achieve in negotiations with the EU27 albeit with many idealistic aims rather than plans and in contrast with the Conservative Party Manifesto commitment to remain in the Single Market. Your Leader has demonstrated her wish to sacrifice jobs and business to satisfy the demands to control immigration. Yet as Home Secretary for six years, she had the opportunity to control immigration but chose not to. She could have applied the EU 2004 law whereby EU migrants must prove they have a job, are studying or have financial means to support themselves within three months of arrival. However, she knew that EU migrants actually earn the UK economy far more in net taxation than they cost, a message she is ignoring now to satisfy the right-wing Eurosceptics and constituencies where UKIP are chasing the Conservative vote. How shameful that she is protecting her own position and keeping her government in power to the detriment of the country’s future.\nI am glad that Mrs May has agreed to give Parliament a vote on the final destination but there must also be a vote by the people. This will include (a) all the 15-17 year olds who were too young to vote in 2016 but whose future will be affected and (b) must include UK citizens living in EU27. The outcome of these negotiations affects their rights as UK citizens too. As my MP, I ask you please to demand this vital democratic right.\nI am also pleased that Mrs May has just announced a White Paper on the bill to trigger Article 50 giving all MPs and Peers a chance for full debate and to table amendments. The government lost 80 days and a great deal of taxpayers’ money by choosing to challenge the High Court judgment but must not now rush either House with this vital step.\nAre our acquired rights as EU citizens about to be taken away?\nThe Leave campaign asserted that, in the event of the vote going in their favour, Article 70 of the little known Vienna Convention of 1969 would protect all those rights acquired by UK citizens during the UK’s 44 years of EEC/EC/EU membership.\nI do not believe that the vote to leave provides any mandate to take away our individual rights acquired over 44 years of the UK’s membership of the EEC/EU. Indeed, Lord Neuberger’s statement that “certain rights enjoyed by UK citizens will be changed” appears to be one of the principal reasons that the Supreme Court has ruled that Article 50 cannot be triggered without the approval of Parliament.\nWill “taking back control” mean a loss of acquired rights? The May Administration must answer these questions concerning the rights of UK citizens living in the UK and abroad. Here are a dozen initial questions:\n-\nPost Brexit, will UK citizens be able to study, live, work (employed or self-employed) and retire freely anywhere in EU27?\n-\nWill travelling to EU27 require UK citizens to join separate immigration queues and obtain visas?\n-\nWill UK citizens maintain access to a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) that currently enables them to receive health care free or at reduced cost at the point of use? The EHIC has reduced the cost of travel insurance. Health insurance is vital for UK citizens living in EU27.\n-\nWill UK citizens be able to shop and bring home goods from anywhere in the EU27 (subject to laws concerning illegal or restricted items) without paying tariffs or excise duties?\n-\nWill retired UK citizens in EU27 countries be able to continue living in their country of choice or will they need to reapply for residency and will their state pensions be protected, whether paid by the UK or an EU state?\n-\nWill children of UK citizens working and living in the EU27 still be able to attend local state schools and will secondary education qualifications gained by UK citizens in other EU countries still be recognised for access to UK universities?\n-\nWill children of UK citizens be allowed to attend low cost EU universities? Will they be allowed to remain in the EU27 after taking their degree(s)?\n-\nWill UK workers in the EU27 be subject to the requirements for obtaining a work permit if Freedom of Movement is no longer possible and will their professional and educational qualifications be recognised in the same way as they are today?\n-\nWill they be able to apply to become nationals of their chosen country and so hold dual nationality?\n-\nWill young UK citizens continue to benefit from the Erasmus student exchange programme, which currently allows UK university students to study or work abroad for between 3-12 months and receive free tuition and some living costs from the EU?\n-\nWill the government guarantee that the withdrawal from EU agencies such as Europol and Eurojust will not expose us to greater risks in the fight against serious international crime and terrorism? If so, how will this be done?\n-\nWill the government guarantee that the rights of safety and protection provided through our membership of agencies such as the following will not be impaired, if so, how will this be done?\n-\nEuropean Agency for Health and Safety at Work\n-\nEuropean Aviation Safety Agency\n-\nEuropean Food Safety Authority\n-\nEuropean Medicines Agency\n-\nEuropean Chemicals Agency\nFinally, Charles Goerens MEP proposed that UK citizens who do not wish to lose the rights of EU citizens be granted Associate EU Citizenship and I fully support this idea.",

Graduates and non-graduates. The haves and the have nots. City dwellers and those who live in smaller towns and rural communities.\nUnprecedented, deep divisions of the kind I have not seen in my lifetime.\nBut we cannot bring the country back together if we pretend that the country has spoken with one united voice.\nPeople who voted to Leave voted for all sorts of reasons, many of which had absolutely nothing to do with the European Union.\nI knocked on doors all over the country, from Hornsey to Huddersfield, and a lot of the Brexit voters I spoke to were actually voting against David Cameron and the Conservative Government.\nSome voted for Leave to send a message to Westminster and register a protest vote.\nSome said they were fed up with public services stretched to breaking point.\nSome said they felt trapped and helpless so they voted for Leave because – as one voter put it to me – “well things can’t get any worse, can they?”\nSo when the Prime Minister speaks of “the will of the people”, her interpretation is frankly no clearer or more precise that anyone else’s.\nLet’s not pretend that the people have spoken, because not all of them have.\nIn fact only 27% of the people of this country voted to Leave. 13 million people didn’t vote. Another 7 million eligible voters weren’t registered. 1 million British expatriates weren’t allowed to vote.\n16 year olds were denied a say, even though it was their futures that were on the ballot paper.\nOnly 2 of the 4 nations that make up the United Kingdom voted to Leave. There was no quadruple lock.\nThere was no two-thirds super-majority – which is common in other countries for a constitutional change of this magnitude.\nEven so, we are told that the people have spoken.\nLook at what we have allowed ourselves to become.\nIn a matter of months our public discourse has been consumed by vitriol and abuse. Hate crimes rose 40% in the aftermath of the referendum vote, and we do not yet know what forces our actual departure will unleash.\nIt is easy to dismiss views with which you disagree if you never actually listen to them at all. If you just dismiss the people who hold them as villains or enemies of the people.\nBut it is in those terms that we are being asked to rubber stamp a blank cheque for the Government to deliver the most extreme version of Brexit imaginable.\nWe are being asked to ignore the fact that leaving the European Union will saddle us with a £60 billion divorce bill.\nThe OBR has forecast that Brexit will cost us another £58 billion over the next 5 years. Where will these cuts fall? We’re not even supposed to ask.\nWe are not going to get tariff-free access to EU customers whilst rejecting free movement. That is not on the table.\nWe are not going to get a more favourable trading arrangement with Europe from outside the Single Market. That is a paradox.\nWe are not going to come to a full agreement with Europe within 2 years. Believing otherwise completely flies in the face of precedent and all evidence.\nExiting without a deal and falling back on World Trade Organisation rules is being talked about as if this is a good option. That is totally wrong. It would be an absolute disaster for this country.\nEven on the optimistic assumption that we can sign trade agreements all over the world, this will not even come close to making up for the loss of the single market.\nWe are facing a return to a hard border in Northern Ireland and a breakdown of the union with Scotland.\nWe are not reclaiming sovereignty, another promise that falls apart under any scrutiny.

However, this is not a general election where we could vote for a change in five years. This was an enormous decision with far reaching effects in every section of our economy and society.\nThe Scottish referendum included any adult living in Scotland but not Scots living anywhere outside of Scotland. It was not fully inclusive of Scottish opinion and, as it affected the whole of the United Kingdom, it was widely felt that the whole of the UK should have voted, although perhaps with some weighting towards Scottish votes. Where they were modern was to realise it mostly affected future generations so 16/17 year olds were included.\n75% of our under 25s want to stay in the EU yet our 16/17 year olds did not have a vote. That is fundamentally wrong and had Cameron included them, we would be jubilant today and he would still have a job. Asked why this referendum matters to young people, Nick Clegg said,\n“In a fairer world, we’d only give the vote to 16 – 24 year olds because the consequences will fall on their shoulders”\nWe have all the financial uncertainty and questions in our country but this has also triggered a negative, destabilising response across the EU. How is that going to help the poorer nations and the migrants crisis? Is there any way out of this? Can the young people rise up and make their voices heard, demand their representation, without violence?\nWhat about Her Majesty? Is she going to allow this to happen or step in as supreme ruler of our kingdom before it is too late? Perhaps she is another senior citizen who is not thinking about her grandchildren. I wonder what our future kings think?\nThen there is the percentage of the vote. 51.9% of the electorate voted to Leave but that is roughly 17 million of 68 million in our country ie 25%. Is that democracy? I think given the enormity there should have been a requirement for at least a clear 5% majority. Clearly, not enough thought was given to the “what if” scenarios of the result.",

He is fluent in Dutch, has studied Spanish and Latin to Higher Level of the International Baccalaureate rather than A Levels, holds grade A* GCSE’s in Italian and French and studied Mandarin, Russian and a little Greek. Not your average English boy. He is about to start his degree course in International Relations and Sustainability with a year abroad in an EU university – if he is allowed to.\nIf Brexit succeeds and is the start of extreme right governments taking over here and succeeding in other EU countries, leading to the eventual break-up of the European Union, then I no longer want to call myself British. We will be hated. We will be spat at in the streets when we go on holiday. British workers abroad will start to receive hateful messages just as EU migrants have been the recipients of disgraceful racism over the last few days.\nWe have to fight for Europe. It is not time to shut up and move on gracefully. It is time to get really angry. Our forefathers fought for Europe. Our children need us to now.\nLeave a comment",

Graduates and non-graduates. The haves and the have nots. City dwellers and those who live in smaller towns and rural communities.\nUnprecedented, deep divisions of the kind I have not seen in my lifetime.\nBut we cannot bring the country back together if we pretend that the country has spoken with one united voice.\nPeople who voted to Leave voted for all sorts of reasons, many of which had absolutely nothing to do with the European Union.\nI knocked on doors all over the country, from Hornsey to Huddersfield, and a lot of the Brexit voters I spoke to were actually voting against David Cameron and the Conservative Government.\nSome voted for Leave to send a message to Westminster and register a protest vote.\nSome said they were fed up with public services stretched to breaking point.\nSome said they felt trapped and helpless so they voted for Leave because – as one voter put it to me – “well things can’t get any worse, can they?”\nSo when the Prime Minister speaks of “the will of the people”, her interpretation is frankly no clearer or more precise that anyone else’s.\nLet’s not pretend that the people have spoken, because not all of them have.\nIn fact only 27% of the people of this country voted to Leave. 13 million people didn’t vote. Another 7 million eligible voters weren’t registered. 1 million British expatriates weren’t allowed to vote.\n16 year olds were denied a say, even though it was their futures that were on the ballot paper.\nOnly 2 of the 4 nations that make up the United Kingdom voted to Leave. There was no quadruple lock.\nThere was no two-thirds super-majority – which is common in other countries for a constitutional change of this magnitude.\nEven so, we are told that the people have spoken.\nLook at what we have allowed ourselves to become.\nIn a matter of months our public discourse has been consumed by vitriol and abuse. Hate crimes rose 40% in the aftermath of the referendum vote, and we do not yet know what forces our actual departure will unleash.\nIt is easy to dismiss views with which you disagree if you never actually listen to them at all. If you just dismiss the people who hold them as villains or enemies of the people.\nBut it is in those terms that we are being asked to rubber stamp a blank cheque for the Government to deliver the most extreme version of Brexit imaginable.\nWe are being asked to ignore the fact that leaving the European Union will saddle us with a £60 billion divorce bill.\nThe OBR has forecast that Brexit will cost us another £58 billion over the next 5 years. Where will these cuts fall? We’re not even supposed to ask.\nWe are not going to get tariff-free access to EU customers whilst rejecting free movement. That is not on the table.\nWe are not going to get a more favourable trading arrangement with Europe from outside the Single Market. That is a paradox.\nWe are not going to come to a full agreement with Europe within 2 years. Believing otherwise completely flies in the face of precedent and all evidence.\nExiting without a deal and falling back on World Trade Organisation rules is being talked about as if this is a good option. That is totally wrong. It would be an absolute disaster for this country.\nEven on the optimistic assumption that we can sign trade agreements all over the world, this will not even come close to making up for the loss of the single market.\nWe are facing a return to a hard border in Northern Ireland and a breakdown of the union with Scotland.\nWe are not reclaiming sovereignty, another promise that falls apart under any scrutiny. We are just transferring it behind the closed doors of negotiating rooms, where other countries will hold a gun to our heads.\nBut we are being asked to forget about all that.\nOur doctors are against Brexit because our health service will collapse without European staff.\nOur scientists are against Brexit because they will lose research grants and talented researchers.\nOur manufacturers are against it because they will lose tariff-free trade with our biggest market.\nOur financial services are against Brexit because they will lose their pass-porting rights.\nOur universities are against Brexit because they will lose funding, staff and students.\nOur exporters are against Brexit because if we leave the customs union they won’t be able to trade without goods being detained and checked at borders.\nBut why would we listen to these people – they are only the experts after all.\nWhat happens in the next two years will define the future of our nation for generations.\nIn everything we have heard so far – the soft Brexit, hard Brexit, clean Brexit, grey Brexit and the red, white and blue Brexit – the Government has shown very little understanding of the huge obstacles they must overcome in the next two years, and even less understanding of the devastating consequences of failure.\nWe have decided that we are leaving, but it is the EU nations that decide how we leave and what we end up with.\nArticle 50 is the start of a process, not the end, and this process will be out of our hands as soon as Article 50 is triggered.\nWhere could we end up in 2019? Out of the single market. Out of the customs union. No trade deal with Europe or anywhere else.\nOur only friend a President with a flagrant disregard for human rights. Do we really want to let ourselves become the 51st state of Trump’s America?\nWe shouldn’t fool ourselves.\nThis is not, and it never has been a debate about the economy. This has always been a debate about immigration.\nWe are staring down the barrel of a hard Brexit because immigration has been prioritised above all else – even the economy, jobs and living standards.\nDuring the campaign, we were sold the lie that we could cut immigration without hitting our economy.\nWe were sold the lie that immigrants come here and take more than they contribute.\nBetween 1995 and 2011 European immigrants made a net contribution of £4.4 billion to our public finances. In the same period our native population cost us £591 billion.\nEconomic migrants are educated at another country’s expense so they subsidise our public spending on the young, the sick and the elderly.\n78% of working age EU migrants are in work, compared to 74% of UK natives. The employment rate of migrants from the 8 countries that joined the EU in 2004 is over 80%.\nOur economy can’t exist without people coming here to do the jobs that people in this country either don’t want to do or don’t have the right skills to do.\nSo not only will our economy take a hit when we leave the Single Market to control immigration, reducing immigration itself will further hurt our economy and make us poorer.\nAnd another truth that the Leave campaign persuaded us to ignore. Last year more people arrived from outside the EU than from within the EU.\nWhen we go around signing new trade deals, countries will demand visas for their people in return.\nPeople have been told that immigration is going to disappear, but we will just be swapping EU immigration for non-EU immigration.\nThis is a voracious race to the bottom that will never end. And so when things go wrong, the backlash against migrants and minorities will be even worse.\nIt is almost half a century since a Member of this House, in a very different era, made these same warnings of “wives unable to obtain hospital beds in childbirth”, “children unable to obtain school places” and “homes and neighbourhoods changed beyond recognition”.\nHow far we have fallen when a black British Member of Parliament, of African and Caribbean descent, has to stand up and start quoting Enoch Powell.\nOn both sides of the Atlantic we can see the resurgence of far-right nationalism and nativist, xenophobic bigotry. Appeasement and compromise won’t work. It never has and it never will. We must meet it head on, before it’s too late.\nIt is the easy option to blame migrants who come here with skills instead of successive Governments – both Conservative and Labour – who have failed.\nFailed to educate our own to compete.\nFailed to build affordable housing.\nFailed to fund our public services.\nFailed to ensure that growth is felt outside of London and the South East.\nA hard Brexit won’t deal with any of the long-standing, structural problems highlighted by the Brexit vote. It will make them worse.\nThe real tragedy is that with Whitehall and Parliament so consumed with Brexit for the next 10 years, we will have no capacity to address these problems.\nLondon and the South East are the only regions where GDP per person is higher today than it was in 2007. Everywhere else, people are worse off than they were before the credit crunch.\nOur economy is an hour glass, with the middle section hollowed out.\nThe middle rungs of the ladder – the breadwinner jobs that paid enough to raise a family on have disappeared. We now only have an asset class and an under-class.\nPoverty is no longer an issue that afflicts the workless. More than half of all people who are in poverty – 7 and a half million in our country – are in a working family.\nReal wages have fallen by 5% since 2009. And at the same time, the average property owner in London makes more money per year from the increased value of their home than the average London salary.\nI will not take lectures about listening to left behind communities.\nI have seen two riots in a generation in Tottenham.\nMy constituents have borne the brunt of austerity since 2010, and it is they who will pay the price of a hard Brexit.\nChild poverty is at 40%. The council spends £20 million a year on bed and breakfasts just to keep families off the street.\nSo I will not betray my constituents by standing by and staying silent as this recklessness drives our economy off a cliff.\nMembers opposite have been dreaming of a low-tax, low-wage, low-regulation offshore tax haven for decades, and now they have it in their grasp they salivate at the thought of us becoming the new Singapore.\nI will not stand with them.\nIf we let the Prime Minister pursue this reckless course – this Brexit at any cost – we know that as always it will be the poor, the weak and the vulnerable who suffer.\nThe referendum was not simply the rebellion of working class Labour heartlands that has been portrayed.\n52% of Leave votes lived in the South of England. 59% were middle class. 58% of those who voted Conservative in 2015 voted Leave in 2016.\nColleagues on these benches must remember who the Labour Party represents – the very people and communities who will pay the price. This is not the time to stay silent or fall into line.\nHow can you walk into the voting lobby shoulder to shoulder with the party of Nigel Farage and the very people whose vision of society we all went into politics to oppose?\nAnd as for Members opposite, where are you? Where are your better instincts? Why have you rolled over and given in to the hard Brexiteers, who have always been on the fringes of your party but who have never, until now, been in the driving seat?\nThis is not a time to put self-interest or party interest ahead of the national interest. There is too much at stake.\nLet me finish by asking just one simple question, once asked by one of our most celebrated Parliamentarians.\n“Is it prudent, is it even possible, however much we might desire it, to turn our backs upon Europe?”\nWhen Churchill spoke those words, he was talking about appeasement and he was going very much against the prevailing wind. The same is true today.\nPatriotism requires more than blind faith. We must remember our history, our values, what we represent and what we stand for. Most of all, we should remember what we stand against.\nFor all of these reasons, and for the sake of the country that I love, I will be voting against the triggering of Article 50.”\nWhat a speech. My thanks to him and all the MPs who voted against the triggering of Article 50 for similar reasons, who put their conscience and patriotism before their career.",

On the contrary, it seemed we were losing control as we plunged into financial turmoil.\nThese lies on which many, many people decided to vote Leave, the decision to take the UK out of the EU was based in totally false promises.\nGreat political cartoon by Morten Morland on 27 June 2016.\nLeave a comment",

Now while some of these short term responses may be corrected in the short term, that does not help businesses today with higher cost for importing of materials and services, nor holiday makers who will have 8€ or 11 € less per £.\nIt was widely expected that Boris Johnson would be the clear favourite to stand as PM and Michael Gove would be his running mate but Gove’s wife, Sarah Vine, “accidentally” leaked an email, destined for him, to a member of the public advising him to be absolutely sure that Boris promised him a top job before lending his support. The next day, Gove, despite all his previous assurances since 2012 that he would not and could not stand as PM, went back on his word and stood for election. Boris responded by not standing.\nMichael Gove is not to be trusted. There is an expression, which is surprisingly from Gavin Esler in “A Scrupulous Man” and not Shakespeare, so often the author of our favourite expressions:\n“He who wields the knife rarely inherits the crown”.\nMichael Gove is one of the Gang of Three (Farage-Johnson-Gove) who duped the public with falsehoods regarding the information on which millions of people based their Remain/Leave vote. Although they thought the public would vote Remain, they are responsible for the constitutional mess that the country finds itself in and the knock-on effect to our European partners and indeed, the worldwide economy. Although there are suggestions that a Brexiteer should lead the country in negotiations post triggering Article 50, there is no way that Gove should be rewarded with the glittering prize. He deceived the country and our memories will not be short.\nFurthermore, with the reforms Michael Gove made as Education Secretary, he is widely hated by teachers and parents of children who will sit GCSE from 2017 onwards – including my son. If the Tories choose Gove as their leader, they are unlikely to win in a General Election.

  "https_europeanbritblog_wordpress_com_/https_europeanbritblog_wordpress_com_tag_votes-for-uk-citizens-in-eu-countries/content_14.html": "Feel free to plagiarise my letter and write to your own MP.\nDear xxx,\nThe Prime Minister’s Brexit speech outlined what she wants to achieve in negotiations with the EU27 albeit with many idealistic aims rather than plans and in contrast with the Conservative Party Manifesto commitment to remain in the Single Market. Your Leader has demonstrated her wish to sacrifice jobs and business to satisfy the demands to control immigration. Yet as Home Secretary for six years, she had the opportunity to control immigration but chose not to. She could have applied the EU 2004 law whereby EU migrants must prove they have a job, are studying or have financial means to support themselves within three months of arrival. However, she knew that EU migrants actually earn the UK economy far more in net taxation than they cost, a message she is ignoring now to satisfy the right-wing Eurosceptics and constituencies where UKIP are chasing the Conservative vote. How shameful that she is protecting her own position and keeping her government in power to the detriment of the country’s future.\nI am glad that Mrs May has agreed to give Parliament a vote on the final destination but there must also be a vote by the people. This will include (a) all the 15-17 year olds who were too young to vote in 2016 but whose future will be affected and (b) must include UK citizens living in EU27. The outcome of these negotiations affects their rights as UK citizens too. As my MP, I ask you please to demand this vital democratic right.\nI am also pleased that Mrs May has just announced a White Paper on the bill to trigger Article 50 giving all MPs and Peers a chance for full debate and to table amendments. The government lost 80 days and a great deal of taxpayers’ money by choosing to challenge the High Court judgment but must not now rush either House with this vital step.\nAre our acquired rights as EU citizens about to be taken away?\nThe Leave campaign asserted that, in the event of the vote going in their favour, Article 70 of the little known Vienna Convention of 1969 would protect all those rights acquired by UK citizens during the UK’s 44 years of EEC/EC/EU membership.\nI do not believe that the vote to leave provides any mandate to take away our individual rights acquired over 44 years of the UK’s membership of the EEC/EU. Indeed, Lord Neuberger’s statement that “certain rights enjoyed by UK citizens will be changed” appears to be one of the principal reasons that the Supreme Court has ruled that Article 50 cannot be triggered without the approval of Parliament.\nWill “taking back control” mean a loss of acquired rights? The May Administration must answer these questions concerning the rights of UK citizens living in the UK and abroad. Here are a dozen initial questions:\n-\nPost Brexit, will UK citizens be able to study, live, work (employed or self-employed) and retire freely anywhere in EU27?\n-\nWill travelling to EU27 require UK citizens to join separate immigration queues and obtain visas?\n-\nWill UK citizens maintain access to a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) that currently enables them to receive health care free or at reduced cost at the point of use? The EHIC has reduced the cost of travel insurance. Health insurance is vital for UK citizens living in EU27.\n-\nWill UK citizens be able to shop and bring home goods from anywhere in the EU27 (subject to laws concerning illegal or restricted items) without paying tariffs or excise duties?\n-\nWill retired UK citizens in EU27 countries be able to continue living in their country of choice or will they need to reapply for residency and will their state pensions be protected, whether paid by the UK or an EU state?\n-\nWill children of UK citizens working and living in the EU27 still be able to attend local state schools and will secondary education qualifications gained by UK citizens in other EU countries still be recognised for access to UK universities?\n-\nWill children of UK citizens be allowed to attend low cost EU universities? Will they be allowed to remain in the EU27 after taking their degree(s)?\n-\nWill UK workers in the EU27 be subject to the requirements for obtaining a work permit if Freedom of Movement is no longer possible and will their professional and educational qualifications be recognised in the same way as they are today?\n-\nWill they be able to apply to become nationals of their chosen country and so hold dual nationality?\n-\nWill young UK citizens continue to benefit from the Erasmus student exchange programme, which currently allows UK university students to study or work abroad for between 3-12 months and receive free tuition and some living costs from the EU?\n-\nWill the government guarantee that the withdrawal from EU agencies such as Europol and Eurojust will not expose us to greater risks in the fight against serious international crime and terrorism? If so, how will this be done?\n-\nWill the government guarantee that the rights of safety and protection provided through our membership of agencies such as the following will not be impaired, if so, how will this be done?\n-\nEuropean Agency for Health and Safety at Work\n-\nEuropean Aviation Safety Agency\n-\nEuropean Food Safety Authority\n-\nEuropean Medicines Agency\n-\nEuropean Chemicals Agency\nFinally, Charles Goerens MEP proposed that UK citizens who do not wish to lose the rights of EU citizens be granted Associate EU Citizenship and I fully support this idea.",

Having optimism of negotiating good deals is all very well but it won’t happen in the time frame. Many Tory voters will be fine IN or OUT but I feel sorry for all the SMEs who have built up good businesses with EU businesses that support their families and the supply chain around them. So many face uncertainty now with possible closure and all because the government want to look after their supporters who will profit from new deals. The hard-up Northerners who were persuaded to vote Leave by the right wing tabloids have been duped by multi-millionaires like Daily Mail’s Paul Dacre and MP Jacob Rees-Mogg. It is they who will suffer financially, not the millionaires. So many industries need migrant workers. I could go on but won’t.\nVoting against Article 50 is not a lack of respect for the 37% minority of the population who actually voted for this monumental mistake. It is about saying, “I wholeheartedly believe this is wrong for the country now and in the future and I am prepared to stand by my conscience rather than blindly follow a leader for the sake of my career”.\nPeople complain about lying, opportunistic politicians so let’s congratulate these for their integrity.\nHistory will judge the spineless who will have to explain to future generations why they knowingly destroyed, or at least completely changed the direction, character and values of this nation for the worst and maybe split the Kingdom.",

Graduates and non-graduates. The haves and the have nots. City dwellers and those who live in smaller towns and rural communities.\nUnprecedented, deep divisions of the kind I have not seen in my lifetime.\nBut we cannot bring the country back together if we pretend that the country has spoken with one united voice.\nPeople who voted to Leave voted for all sorts of reasons, many of which had absolutely nothing to do with the European Union.\nI knocked on doors all over the country, from Hornsey to Huddersfield, and a lot of the Brexit voters I spoke to were actually voting against David Cameron and the Conservative Government.\nSome voted for Leave to send a message to Westminster and register a protest vote.\nSome said they were fed up with public services stretched to breaking point.\nSome said they felt trapped and helpless so they voted for Leave because – as one voter put it to me – “well things can’t get any worse, can they?”\nSo when the Prime Minister speaks of “the will of the people”, her interpretation is frankly no clearer or more precise that anyone else’s.\nLet’s not pretend that the people have spoken, because not all of them have.\nIn fact only 27% of the people of this country voted to Leave. 13 million people didn’t vote. Another 7 million eligible voters weren’t registered. 1 million British expatriates weren’t allowed to vote.\n16 year olds were denied a say, even though it was their futures that were on the ballot paper.\nOnly 2 of the 4 nations that make up the United Kingdom voted to Leave. There was no quadruple lock.\nThere was no two-thirds super-majority – which is common in other countries for a constitutional change of this magnitude.\nEven so, we are told that the people have spoken.\nLook at what we have allowed ourselves to become.\nIn a matter of months our public discourse has been consumed by vitriol and abuse. Hate crimes rose 40% in the aftermath of the referendum vote, and we do not yet know what forces our actual departure will unleash.\nIt is easy to dismiss views with which you disagree if you never actually listen to them at all. If you just dismiss the people who hold them as villains or enemies of the people.\nBut it is in those terms that we are being asked to rubber stamp a blank cheque for the Government to deliver the most extreme version of Brexit imaginable.\nWe are being asked to ignore the fact that leaving the European Union will saddle us with a £60 billion divorce bill.\nThe OBR has forecast that Brexit will cost us another £58 billion over the next 5 years. Where will these cuts fall? We’re not even supposed to ask.\nWe are not going to get tariff-free access to EU customers whilst rejecting free movement. That is not on the table.\nWe are not going to get a more favourable trading arrangement with Europe from outside the Single Market. That is a paradox.\nWe are not going to come to a full agreement with Europe within 2 years. Believing otherwise completely flies in the face of precedent and all evidence.\nExiting without a deal and falling back on World Trade Organisation rules is being talked about as if this is a good option. That is totally wrong. It would be an absolute disaster for this country.\nEven on the optimistic assumption that we can sign trade agreements all over the world, this will not even come close to making up for the loss of the single market.\nWe are facing a return to a hard border in Northern Ireland and a breakdown of the union with Scotland.\nWe are not reclaiming sovereignty, another promise that falls apart under any scrutiny. We are just transferring it behind the closed doors of negotiating rooms, where other countries will hold a gun to our heads.\nBut we are being asked to forget about all that.\nOur doctors are against Brexit because our health service will collapse without European staff.\nOur scientists are against Brexit because they will lose research grants and talented researchers.\nOur manufacturers are against it because they will lose tariff-free trade with our biggest market.\nOur financial services are against Brexit because they will lose their pass-porting rights.\nOur universities are against Brexit because they will lose funding, staff and students.\nOur exporters are against Brexit because if we leave the customs union they won’t be able to trade without goods being detained and checked at borders.\nBut why would we listen to these people – they are only the experts after all.\nWhat happens in the next two years will define the future of our nation for generations.\nIn everything we have heard so far – the soft Brexit, hard Brexit, clean Brexit, grey Brexit and the red, white and blue Brexit – the Government has shown very little understanding of the huge obstacles they must overcome in the next two years, and even less understanding of the devastating consequences of failure.\nWe have decided that we are leaving, but it is the EU nations that decide how we leave and what we end up with.\nArticle 50 is the start of a process, not the end, and this process will be out of our hands as soon as Article 50 is triggered.\nWhere could we end up in 2019? Out of the single market. Out of the customs union. No trade deal with Europe or anywhere else.\nOur only friend a President with a flagrant disregard for human rights. Do we really want to let ourselves become the 51st state of Trump’s America?\nWe shouldn’t fool ourselves.\nThis is not, and it never has been a debate about the economy. This has always been a debate about immigration.\nWe are staring down the barrel of a hard Brexit because immigration has been prioritised above all else – even the economy, jobs and living standards.\nDuring the campaign, we were sold the lie that we could cut immigration without hitting our economy.\nWe were sold the lie that immigrants come here and take more than they contribute.\nBetween 1995 and 2011 European immigrants made a net contribution of £4.4 billion to our public finances. In the same period our native population cost us £591 billion.\nEconomic migrants are educated at another country’s expense so they subsidise our public spending on the young, the sick and the elderly.\n78% of working age EU migrants are in work, compared to 74% of UK natives. The employment rate of migrants from the 8 countries that joined the EU in 2004 is over 80%.\nOur economy can’t exist without people coming here to do the jobs that people in this country either don’t want to do or don’t have the right skills to do.\nSo not only will our economy take a hit when we leave the Single Market to control immigration, reducing immigration itself will further hurt our economy and make us poorer.\nAnd another truth that the Leave campaign persuaded us to ignore. Last year more people arrived from outside the EU than from within the EU.\nWhen we go around signing new trade deals, countries will demand visas for their people in return.\nPeople have been told that immigration is going to disappear, but we will just be swapping EU immigration for non-EU immigration.\nThis is a voracious race to the bottom that will never end. And so when things go wrong, the backlash against migrants and minorities will be even worse.\nIt is almost half a century since a Member of this House, in a very different era, made these same warnings of “wives unable to obtain hospital beds in childbirth”, “children unable to obtain school places” and “homes and neighbourhoods changed beyond recognition”.\nHow far we have fallen when a black British Member of Parliament, of African and Caribbean descent, has to stand up and start quoting Enoch Powell.\nOn both sides of the Atlantic we can see the resurgence of far-right nationalism and nativist, xenophobic bigotry. Appeasement and compromise won’t work. It never has and it never will. We must meet it head on, before it’s too late.\nIt is the easy option to blame migrants who come here with skills instead of successive Governments – both Conservative and Labour – who have failed.\nFailed to educate our own to compete.\nFailed to build affordable housing.\nFailed to fund our public services.\nFailed to ensure that growth is felt outside of London and the South East.\nA hard Brexit won’t deal with any of the long-standing, structural problems highlighted by the Brexit vote. It will make them worse.\nThe real tragedy is that with Whitehall and Parliament so consumed with Brexit for the next 10 years, we will have no capacity to address these problems.\nLondon and the South East are the only regions where GDP per person is higher today than it was in 2007. Everywhere else, people are worse off than they were before the credit crunch.\nOur economy is an hour glass, with the middle section hollowed out.\nThe middle rungs of the ladder – the breadwinner jobs that paid enough to raise a family on have disappeared. We now only have an asset class and an under-class.\nPoverty is no longer an issue that afflicts the workless. More than half of all people who are in poverty – 7 and a half million in our country – are in a working family.\nReal wages have fallen by 5% since 2009. And at the same time, the average property owner in London makes more money per year from the increased value of their home than the average London salary.\nI will not take lectures about listening to left behind communities.\nI have seen two riots in a generation in Tottenham.\nMy constituents have borne the brunt of austerity since 2010, and it is they who will pay the price of a hard Brexit.\nChild poverty is at 40%. The council spends £20 million a year on bed and breakfasts just to keep families off the street.\nSo I will not betray my constituents by standing by and staying silent as this recklessness drives our economy off a cliff.\nMembers opposite have been dreaming of a low-tax, low-wage, low-regulation offshore tax haven for decades, and now they have it in their grasp they salivate at the thought of us becoming the new Singapore.\nI will not stand with them.\nIf we let the Prime Minister pursue this reckless course – this Brexit at any cost – we know that as always it will be the poor, the weak and the vulnerable who suffer.\nThe referendum was not simply the rebellion of working class Labour heartlands that has been portrayed.\n52% of Leave votes lived in the South of England. 59% were middle class. 58% of those who voted Conservative in 2015 voted Leave in 2016.\nColleagues on these benches must remember who the Labour Party represents – the very people and communities who will pay the price. This is not the time to stay silent or fall into line.\nHow can you walk into the voting lobby shoulder to shoulder with the party of Nigel Farage and the very people whose vision of society we all went into politics to oppose?\nAnd as for Members opposite, where are you? Where are your better instincts? Why have you rolled over and given in to the hard Brexiteers, who have always been on the fringes of your party but who have never, until now, been in the driving seat?\nThis is not a time to put self-interest or party interest ahead of the national interest. There is too much at stake.\nLet me finish by asking just one simple question, once asked by one of our most celebrated Parliamentarians.\n“Is it prudent, is it even possible, however much we might desire it, to turn our backs upon Europe?”\nWhen Churchill spoke those words, he was talking about appeasement and he was going very much against the prevailing wind. The same is true today.\nPatriotism requires more than blind faith. We must remember our history, our values, what we represent and what we stand for. Most of all, we should remember what we stand against.\nFor all of these reasons, and for the sake of the country that I love, I will be voting against the triggering of Article 50.”\nWhat a speech. My thanks to him and all the MPs who voted against the triggering of Article 50 for similar reasons, who put their conscience and patriotism before their career.",
  "https_europeanbritblog_wordpress_com_/https_europeanbritblog_wordpress_com_tag_nigel-farage/content_4.html": "Since we woke up to the dreadful news that somehow Britain had voted to Leave the EU, life has not been the same and I wonder whether it ever will be. I still feel dazed, in shock and so, so upset. I am literally heartbroken.\nLast Friday, the PM who had called this referendum, David Cameron, resigned. I was angry with him at the time for walking out, abandoning us to the mess his decision had caused. Since then I have watched him, the statesman that he is, doing his best to lead Parliament and find the best solution for the country he loves. I know that inside he too is broken.\nThis was never meant to happen. Cameron wanted to appease the Eurosceptic right-wingers in his party but somehow the scripts were mixed up. We should have shown the arrogant Nigel Farage that whilst he has his supporters, this country is not his to overrun with his racist and rude opinions. Farage on his own was not a votes winner. He needed support to spearhead the campaign. In that he found Boris Johnson, the Etonian boy groomed to be a future PM, just waiting in the wings after his eight years as Mayor of London. Now Boris is clever and he realised that fellow Etonian Cameron would not have the support of the masses. He saw this as his chance to walk triumphantly into No.10. Boris does not really want us to leave the EU, he was pro-Europe in earlier speeches, indeed in one he even said how he could not wait for the “great moment” when the two halves of the Roman Empire “are at last reunited in an expanded European Union” in a documentary he made for the BBC.\nYet tonight, Boris Johnson is in disgrace, licking his wounds and confirmed as not standing in the Tory party leadership contest. For the first time in a week I laughed, really laughed. The main who lied and change his support as part of his plan to win the top job has been exposed as a career politician who even put his country to ransom for his ambitions. This is one holy Eton Mess.\nI tweeted that we should take him to the Tower of London, via Traitors Gate and hang him.\nI have always liked Boris, who doesn’t with his incredible charisma? But this man will go down in history as the man who caused a constitutional crisis, lost billions of our wealth and plunged the UK and indeed the world into uncertainty. Confidence is falling and we could fall into recession.\nGeorge Osbourne, our Chancellor, was on target to achieve his goal of wiping out our budget deficit. All his work will have been wiped out by this most contemptuous of men, Boris Johnson. Osbourne too was expected to stand in the leadership but decided that he was not the man to bring unity.\nBoris’s side-kick in the Leave campaign, Michael Gove, who was supposed to back him in the hope of one of the top jobs, possibly Chancellor, has stabbed him in the back , declared Boris unfit to lead and offered himself into the leadership battle. This is the man who said in 2012, that he could not and would not stand for PM.\nThen there is Jeremy Corbyn, the nice Marxist who calls himself the Labour Leader. 172 to 40 of his MPs declared no confidence in him after nearly all of his Shadow Cabinet resigned and yet he sits there stubbornly, saying he has the mandate of his party members. That may be the case but in Parliament his job is to provide effective leadership of the Opposition and that he is failing to do. In fact today Nicola Sturgeon, leader of the Scottish Nationalist Party, said that the SNP should now take on the mantle of the Opposition as they are clearly united.\nAmidst all this, Tim Farron, leader of the Liberal Democrats, has spoken of his heartbreak but said we must seek a future for the UK within the EU. He has made UK’s membership of the EU the top policy for the party manifesto and is building strength in the party for the autumn General Election which many believe will come. Since Friday morning, 12,000 new members have joined the party no doubt seeking for a way to remain in the EU and looking to Tim to find a way. He says if we must leave, then we need to find a new model and he believes the Norwegian one to be the best although it will cost us more to achieve the same as we already have. That is what the Remain campaign kept saying when people talked of Norway, Switzerland, Iceland and other one foot in models without full membership.\nIt has been a long week but I think tonight I might sleep more soundly knowing that Boris has had his just reward.",

Graduates and non-graduates. The haves and the have nots. City dwellers and those who live in smaller towns and rural communities.\nUnprecedented, deep divisions of the kind I have not seen in my lifetime.\nBut we cannot bring the country back together if we pretend that the country has spoken with one united voice.\nPeople who voted to Leave voted for all sorts of reasons, many of which had absolutely nothing to do with the European Union.\nI knocked on doors all over the country, from Hornsey to Huddersfield, and a lot of the Brexit voters I spoke to were actually voting against David Cameron and the Conservative Government.\nSome voted for Leave to send a message to Westminster and register a protest vote.\nSome said they were fed up with public services stretched to breaking point.\nSome said they felt trapped and helpless so they voted for Leave because – as one voter put it to me – “well things can’t get any worse, can they?”\nSo when the Prime Minister speaks of “the will of the people”, her interpretation is frankly no clearer or more precise that anyone else’s.\nLet’s not pretend that the people have spoken, because not all of them have.\nIn fact only 27% of the people of this country voted to Leave. 13 million people didn’t vote. Another 7 million eligible voters weren’t registered. 1 million British expatriates weren’t allowed to vote.\n16 year olds were denied a say, even though it was their futures that were on the ballot paper.\nOnly 2 of the 4 nations that make up the United Kingdom voted to Leave. There was no quadruple lock.\nThere was no two-thirds super-majority – which is common in other countries for a constitutional change of this magnitude.\nEven so, we are told that the people have spoken.\nLook at what we have allowed ourselves to become.\nIn a matter of months our public discourse has been consumed by vitriol and abuse. Hate crimes rose 40% in the aftermath of the referendum vote, and we do not yet know what forces our actual departure will unleash.\nIt is easy to dismiss views with which you disagree if you never actually listen to them at all. If you just dismiss the people who hold them as villains or enemies of the people.\nBut it is in those terms that we are being asked to rubber stamp a blank cheque for the Government to deliver the most extreme version of Brexit imaginable.\nWe are being asked to ignore the fact that leaving the European Union will saddle us with a £60 billion divorce bill.\nThe OBR has forecast that Brexit will cost us another £58 billion over the next 5 years. Where will these cuts fall? We’re not even supposed to ask.\nWe are not going to get tariff-free access to EU customers whilst rejecting free movement. That is not on the table.\nWe are not going to get a more favourable trading arrangement with Europe from outside the Single Market. That is a paradox.\nWe are not going to come to a full agreement with Europe within 2 years. Believing otherwise completely flies in the face of precedent and all evidence.\nExiting without a deal and falling back on World Trade Organisation rules is being talked about as if this is a good option. That is totally wrong. It would be an absolute disaster for this country.\nEven on the optimistic assumption that we can sign trade agreements all over the world, this will not even come close to making up for the loss of the single market.\nWe are facing a return to a hard border in Northern Ireland and a breakdown of the union with Scotland.\nWe are not reclaiming sovereignty, another promise that falls apart under any scrutiny. We are just transferring it behind the closed doors of negotiating rooms, where other countries will hold a gun to our heads.\nBut we are being asked to forget about all that.\nOur doctors are against Brexit because our health service will collapse without European staff.\nOur scientists are against Brexit because they will lose research grants and talented researchers.\nOur manufacturers are against it because they will lose tariff-free trade with our biggest market.\nOur financial services are against Brexit because they will lose their pass-porting rights.\nOur universities are against Brexit because they will lose funding, staff and students.\nOur exporters are against Brexit because if we leave the customs union they won’t be able to trade without goods being detained and checked at borders.\nBut why would we listen to these people – they are only the experts after all.\nWhat happens in the next two years will define the future of our nation for generations.\nIn everything we have heard so far – the soft Brexit, hard Brexit, clean Brexit, grey Brexit and the red, white and blue Brexit – the Government has shown very little understanding of the huge obstacles they must overcome in the next two years, and even less understanding of the devastating consequences of failure.\nWe have decided that we are leaving, but it is the EU nations that decide how we leave and what we end up with.\nArticle 50 is the start of a process, not the end, and this process will be out of our hands as soon as Article 50 is triggered.\nWhere could we end up in 2019? Out of the single market. Out of the customs union. No trade deal with Europe or anywhere else.\nOur only friend a President with a flagrant disregard for human rights. Do we really want to let ourselves become the 51st state of Trump’s America?\nWe shouldn’t fool ourselves.\nThis is not, and it never has been a debate about the economy. This has always been a debate about immigration.\nWe are staring down the barrel of a hard Brexit because immigration has been prioritised above all else – even the economy, jobs and living standards.\nDuring the campaign, we were sold the lie that we could cut immigration without hitting our economy.\nWe were sold the lie that immigrants come here and take more than they contribute.\nBetween 1995 and 2011 European immigrants made a net contribution of £4.4 billion to our public finances.

I still feel dazed, in shock and so, so upset. I am literally heartbroken.\nLast Friday, the PM who had called this referendum, David Cameron, resigned. I was angry with him at the time for walking out, abandoning us to the mess his decision had caused. Since then I have watched him, the statesman that he is, doing his best to lead Parliament and find the best solution for the country he loves. I know that inside he too is broken.\nThis was never meant to happen. Cameron wanted to appease the Eurosceptic right-wingers in his party but somehow the scripts were mixed up. We should have shown the arrogant Nigel Farage that whilst he has his supporters, this country is not his to overrun with his racist and rude opinions. Farage on his own was not a votes winner. He needed support to spearhead the campaign. In that he found Boris Johnson, the Etonian boy groomed to be a future PM, just waiting in the wings after his eight years as Mayor of London. Now Boris is clever and he realised that fellow Etonian Cameron would not have the support of the masses. He saw this as his chance to walk triumphantly into No.10. Boris does not really want us to leave the EU, he was pro-Europe in earlier speeches, indeed in one he even said how he could not wait for the “great moment” when the two halves of the Roman Empire “are at last reunited in an expanded European Union” in a documentary he made for the BBC.\nYet tonight, Boris Johnson is in disgrace, licking his wounds and confirmed as not standing in the Tory party leadership contest. For the first time in a week I laughed, really laughed. The main who lied and change his support as part of his plan to win the top job has been exposed as a career politician who even put his country to ransom for his ambitions. This is one holy Eton Mess.\nI tweeted that we should take him to the Tower of London, via Traitors Gate and hang him.\nI have always liked Boris, who doesn’t with his incredible charisma? But this man will go down in history as the man who caused a constitutional crisis, lost billions of our wealth and plunged the UK and indeed the world into uncertainty. Confidence is falling and we could fall into recession.\nGeorge Osbourne, our Chancellor, was on target to achieve his goal of wiping out our budget deficit. All his work will have been wiped out by this most contemptuous of men, Boris Johnson. Osbourne too was expected to stand in the leadership but decided that he was not the man to bring unity.\nBoris’s side-kick in the Leave campaign, Michael Gove, who was supposed to back him in the hope of one of the top jobs, possibly Chancellor, has stabbed him in the back , declared Boris unfit to lead and offered himself into the leadership battle. This is the man who said in 2012, that he could not and would not stand for PM.\nThen there is Jeremy Corbyn, the nice Marxist who calls himself the Labour Leader. 172 to 40 of his MPs declared no confidence in him after nearly all of his Shadow Cabinet resigned and yet he sits there stubbornly, saying he has the mandate of his party members. That may be the case but in Parliament his job is to provide effective leadership of the Opposition and that he is failing to do. In fact today Nicola Sturgeon, leader of the Scottish Nationalist Party, said that the SNP should now take on the mantle of the Opposition as they are clearly united.\nAmidst all this, Tim Farron, leader of the Liberal Democrats, has spoken of his heartbreak but said we must seek a future for the UK within the EU. He has made UK’s membership of the EU the top policy for the party manifesto and is building strength in the party for the autumn General Election which many believe will come. Since Friday morning, 12,000 new members have joined the party no doubt seeking for a way to remain in the EU and looking to Tim to find a way. He says if we must leave, then we need to find a new model and he believes the Norwegian one to be the best although it will cost us more to achieve the same as we already have.

This has always been a debate about immigration.\nWe are staring down the barrel of a hard Brexit because immigration has been prioritised above all else – even the economy, jobs and living standards.\nDuring the campaign, we were sold the lie that we could cut immigration without hitting our economy.\nWe were sold the lie that immigrants come here and take more than they contribute.\nBetween 1995 and 2011 European immigrants made a net contribution of £4.4 billion to our public finances. In the same period our native population cost us £591 billion.\nEconomic migrants are educated at another country’s expense so they subsidise our public spending on the young, the sick and the elderly.\n78% of working age EU migrants are in work, compared to 74% of UK natives. The employment rate of migrants from the 8 countries that joined the EU in 2004 is over 80%.\nOur economy can’t exist without people coming here to do the jobs that people in this country either don’t want to do or don’t have the right skills to do.\nSo not only will our economy take a hit when we leave the Single Market to control immigration, reducing immigration itself will further hurt our economy and make us poorer.\nAnd another truth that the Leave campaign persuaded us to ignore. Last year more people arrived from outside the EU than from within the EU.\nWhen we go around signing new trade deals, countries will demand visas for their people in return.\nPeople have been told that immigration is going to disappear, but we will just be swapping EU immigration for non-EU immigration.\nThis is a voracious race to the bottom that will never end. And so when things go wrong, the backlash against migrants and minorities will be even worse.\nIt is almost half a century since a Member of this House, in a very different era, made these same warnings of “wives unable to obtain hospital beds in childbirth”, “children unable to obtain school places” and “homes and neighbourhoods changed beyond recognition”.\nHow far we have fallen when a black British Member of Parliament, of African and Caribbean descent, has to stand up and start quoting Enoch Powell.\nOn both sides of the Atlantic we can see the resurgence of far-right nationalism and nativist, xenophobic bigotry. Appeasement and compromise won’t work. It never has and it never will. We must meet it head on, before it’s too late.\nIt is the easy option to blame migrants who come here with skills instead of successive Governments – both Conservative and Labour – who have failed.\nFailed to educate our own to compete.\nFailed to build affordable housing.\nFailed to fund our public services.\nFailed to ensure that growth is felt outside of London and the South East.\nA hard Brexit won’t deal with any of the long-standing, structural problems highlighted by the Brexit vote. It will make them worse.\nThe real tragedy is that with Whitehall and Parliament so consumed with Brexit for the next 10 years, we will have no capacity to address these problems.\nLondon and the South East are the only regions where GDP per person is higher today than it was in 2007. Everywhere else, people are worse off than they were before the credit crunch.\nOur economy is an hour glass, with the middle section hollowed out.\nThe middle rungs of the ladder – the breadwinner jobs that paid enough to raise a family on have disappeared. We now only have an asset class and an under-class.\nPoverty is no longer an issue that afflicts the workless. More than half of all people who are in poverty – 7 and a half million in our country – are in a working family.\nReal wages have fallen by 5% since 2009. And at the same time, the average property owner in London makes more money per year from the increased value of their home than the average London salary.\nI will not take lectures about listening to left behind communities.\nI have seen two riots in a generation in Tottenham.\nMy constituents have borne the brunt of austerity since 2010, and it is they who will pay the price of a hard Brexit.\nChild poverty is at 40%. The council spends £20 million a year on bed and breakfasts just to keep families off the street.\nSo I will not betray my constituents by standing by and staying silent as this recklessness drives our economy off a cliff.\nMembers opposite have been dreaming of a low-tax, low-wage, low-regulation offshore tax haven for decades, and now they have it in their grasp they salivate at the thought of us becoming the new Singapore.\nI will not stand with them.\nIf we let the Prime Minister pursue this reckless course – this Brexit at any cost – we know that as always it will be the poor, the weak and the vulnerable who suffer.\nThe referendum was not simply the rebellion of working class Labour heartlands that has been portrayed.\n52% of Leave votes lived in the South of England. 59% were middle class. 58% of those who voted Conservative in 2015 voted Leave in 2016.\nColleagues on these benches must remember who the Labour Party represents – the very people and communities who will pay the price. This is not the time to stay silent or fall into line.\nHow can you walk into the voting lobby shoulder to shoulder with the party of Nigel Farage and the very people whose vision of society we all went into politics to oppose?\nAnd as for Members opposite, where are you? Where are your better instincts? Why have you rolled over and given in to the hard Brexiteers, who have always been on the fringes of your party but who have never, until now, been in the driving seat?\nThis is not a time to put self-interest or party interest ahead of the national interest. There is too much at stake.\nLet me finish by asking just one simple question, once asked by one of our most celebrated Parliamentarians.\n“Is it prudent, is it even possible, however much we might desire it, to turn our backs upon Europe?”\nWhen Churchill spoke those words, he was talking about appeasement and he was going very much against the prevailing wind. The same is true today.\nPatriotism requires more than blind faith. We must remember our history, our values, what we represent and what we stand for. Most of all, we should remember what we stand against.\nFor all of these reasons, and for the sake of the country that I love, I will be voting against the triggering of Article 50.”\nWhat a speech. My thanks to him and all the MPs who voted against the triggering of Article 50 for similar reasons, who put their conscience and patriotism before their career.",
  "https_europeanbritblog_wordpress_com_/https_europeanbritblog_wordpress_com_tag_associate-eu-membership/content_37.html": "Feel free to plagiarise my letter and write to your own MP.\nDear xxx,\nThe Prime Minister’s Brexit speech outlined what she wants to achieve in negotiations with the EU27 albeit with many idealistic aims rather than plans and in contrast with the Conservative Party Manifesto commitment to remain in the Single Market. Your Leader has demonstrated her wish to sacrifice jobs and business to satisfy the demands to control immigration. Yet as Home Secretary for six years, she had the opportunity to control immigration but chose not to. She could have applied the EU 2004 law whereby EU migrants must prove they have a job, are studying or have financial means to support themselves within three months of arrival. However, she knew that EU migrants actually earn the UK economy far more in net taxation than they cost, a message she is ignoring now to satisfy the right-wing Eurosceptics and constituencies where UKIP are chasing the Conservative vote. How shameful that she is protecting her own position and keeping her government in power to the detriment of the country’s future.\nI am glad that Mrs May has agreed to give Parliament a vote on the final destination but there must also be a vote by the people. This will include (a) all the 15-17 year olds who were too young to vote in 2016 but whose future will be affected and (b) must include UK citizens living in EU27. The outcome of these negotiations affects their rights as UK citizens too. As my MP, I ask you please to demand this vital democratic right.\nI am also pleased that Mrs May has just announced a White Paper on the bill to trigger Article 50 giving all MPs and Peers a chance for full debate and to table amendments. The government lost 80 days and a great deal of taxpayers’ money by choosing to challenge the High Court judgment but must not now rush either House with this vital step.\nAre our acquired rights as EU citizens about to be taken away?\nThe Leave campaign asserted that, in the event of the vote going in their favour, Article 70 of the little known Vienna Convention of 1969 would protect all those rights acquired by UK citizens during the UK’s 44 years of EEC/EC/EU membership.\nI do not believe that the vote to leave provides any mandate to take away our individual rights acquired over 44 years of the UK’s membership of the EEC/EU. Indeed, Lord Neuberger’s statement that “certain rights enjoyed by UK citizens will be changed” appears to be one of the principal reasons that the Supreme Court has ruled that Article 50 cannot be triggered without the approval of Parliament.\nWill “taking back control” mean a loss of acquired rights? The May Administration must answer these questions concerning the rights of UK citizens living in the UK and abroad. Here are a dozen initial questions:\n-\nPost Brexit, will UK citizens be able to study, live, work (employed or self-employed) and retire freely anywhere in EU27?\n-\nWill travelling to EU27 require UK citizens to join separate immigration queues and obtain visas?\n-\nWill UK citizens maintain access to a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) that currently enables them to receive health care free or at reduced cost at the point of use? The EHIC has reduced the cost of travel insurance. Health insurance is vital for UK citizens living in EU27.\n-\nWill UK citizens be able to shop and bring home goods from anywhere in the EU27 (subject to laws concerning illegal or restricted items) without paying tariffs or excise duties?\n-\nWill retired UK citizens in EU27 countries be able to continue living in their country of choice or will they need to reapply for residency and will their state pensions be protected, whether paid by the UK or an EU state?\n-\nWill children of UK citizens working and living in the EU27 still be able to attend local state schools and will secondary education qualifications gained by UK citizens in other EU countries still be recognised for access to UK universities?\n-\nWill children of UK citizens be allowed to attend low cost EU universities? Will they be allowed to remain in the EU27 after taking their degree(s)?\n-\nWill UK workers in the EU27 be subject to the requirements for obtaining a work permit if Freedom of Movement is no longer possible and will their professional and educational qualifications be recognised in the same way as they are today?\n-\nWill they be able to apply to become nationals of their chosen country and so hold dual nationality?\n-\nWill young UK citizens continue to benefit from the Erasmus student exchange programme, which currently allows UK university students to study or work abroad for between 3-12 months and receive free tuition and some living costs from the EU?\n-\nWill the government guarantee that the withdrawal from EU agencies such as Europol and Eurojust will not expose us to greater risks in the fight against serious international crime and terrorism? If so, how will this be done?\n-\nWill the government guarantee that the rights of safety and protection provided through our membership of agencies such as the following will not be impaired, if so, how will this be done?\n-\nEuropean Agency for Health and Safety at Work\n-\nEuropean Aviation Safety Agency\n-\nEuropean Food Safety Authority\n-\nEuropean Medicines Agency\n-\nEuropean Chemicals Agency\nFinally, Charles Goerens MEP proposed that UK citizens who do not wish to lose the rights of EU citizens be granted Associate EU Citizenship and I fully support this idea.",
  "https_europeanbritblog_wordpress_com_/https_europeanbritblog_wordpress_com_tag_ukip/content_57.html": "I heard a Leave voter on LBC today saying she voted that way because she believed the message that £350 million would be paid back into the NHS and there would be more money for education and more jobs. She now knows this was a blatant lie and feels disgraced at voting the way she did. She fully supports a multi-cultural society, indeed her daughter is dating a black guy.\nMaking this vote about immigration was a Fascist ticket and I too believe that the vast majority are more tolerant and inclusive. Yet there have been over 400 cases of race crime since the result, up from the usual 60-80 per week. The rise of UKIP has been ugly. Unfortunately, my 15 year old son tells me what some of his classmates believe so they must be fed this filth by their chav parents with two council estates within the catchment area. The teachers have a hard job teaching tolerance and inclusion within a very small window of time on a crowded timetable.\nMichael Gove, as Education Secretary, removed GCSE Psychology and Sociology because apparently teaching teenagers about people and society is not as important as STEM subjects. Yes, STEM subjects are important but we do not all need to know the details to live successfully in society as adults. Teaching comparative religions and morals in Ethics & Philosophy has also been sidelined in my son’s school and history is optional post 14. For me these should be core subjects, vital to engendering tolerance and multi-cultural co-habitation. When you decide that learning about prisms of light, non-ferrous metals and vectors is more important that understanding what other people think and believe, it is no surprise that 58% voted to Leave in Portsmouth and 62% in Havant.\nAll the tabloid newspapers supported Leave. They are easy to read with lots of photos and cost 20p-80p. Compare these to the intelligent press with reasoned discussions for £1-£2.40. The tabloids feed the sort of language which incites xenophobia and racism:\nDaily Express: “Migrants make mugs of us all”, “We must stop the migrant invasion”, “Britain must ban migrants” – Disgraceful.\nNo wonder we have heard stories this week of Polish children in school being told to go home, children who were born here!\nWhat is happening to our country? I am not sure that I recognise it any more.",

Graduates and non-graduates. The haves and the have nots. City dwellers and those who live in smaller towns and rural communities.\nUnprecedented, deep divisions of the kind I have not seen in my lifetime.\nBut we cannot bring the country back together if we pretend that the country has spoken with one united voice.\nPeople who voted to Leave voted for all sorts of reasons, many of which had absolutely nothing to do with the European Union.\nI knocked on doors all over the country, from Hornsey to Huddersfield, and a lot of the Brexit voters I spoke to were actually voting against David Cameron and the Conservative Government.\nSome voted for Leave to send a message to Westminster and register a protest vote.\nSome said they were fed up with public services stretched to breaking point.\nSome said they felt trapped and helpless so they voted for Leave because – as one voter put it to me – “well things can’t get any worse, can they?”\nSo when the Prime Minister speaks of “the will of the people”, her interpretation is frankly no clearer or more precise that anyone else’s.\nLet’s not pretend that the people have spoken, because not all of them have.\nIn fact only 27% of the people of this country voted to Leave. 13 million people didn’t vote. Another 7 million eligible voters weren’t registered. 1 million British expatriates weren’t allowed to vote.\n16 year olds were denied a say, even though it was their futures that were on the ballot paper.\nOnly 2 of the 4 nations that make up the United Kingdom voted to Leave. There was no quadruple lock.\nThere was no two-thirds super-majority – which is common in other countries for a constitutional change of this magnitude.\nEven so, we are told that the people have spoken.\nLook at what we have allowed ourselves to become.\nIn a matter of months our public discourse has been consumed by vitriol and abuse. Hate crimes rose 40% in the aftermath of the referendum vote, and we do not yet know what forces our actual departure will unleash.\nIt is easy to dismiss views with which you disagree if you never actually listen to them at all. If you just dismiss the people who hold them as villains or enemies of the people.\nBut it is in those terms that we are being asked to rubber stamp a blank cheque for the Government to deliver the most extreme version of Brexit imaginable.\nWe are being asked to ignore the fact that leaving the European Union will saddle us with a £60 billion divorce bill.\nThe OBR has forecast that Brexit will cost us another £58 billion over the next 5 years. Where will these cuts fall? We’re not even supposed to ask.\nWe are not going to get tariff-free access to EU customers whilst rejecting free movement. That is not on the table.\nWe are not going to get a more favourable trading arrangement with Europe from outside the Single Market. That is a paradox.\nWe are not going to come to a full agreement with Europe within 2 years. Believing otherwise completely flies in the face of precedent and all evidence.\nExiting without a deal and falling back on World Trade Organisation rules is being talked about as if this is a good option. That is totally wrong. It would be an absolute disaster for this country.\nEven on the optimistic assumption that we can sign trade agreements all over the world, this will not even come close to making up for the loss of the single market.\nWe are facing a return to a hard border in Northern Ireland and a breakdown of the union with Scotland.\nWe are not reclaiming sovereignty, another promise that falls apart under any scrutiny. We are just transferring it behind the closed doors of negotiating rooms, where other countries will hold a gun to our heads.\nBut we are being asked to forget about all that.\nOur doctors are against Brexit because our health service will collapse without European staff.\nOur scientists are against Brexit because they will lose research grants and talented researchers.\nOur manufacturers are against it because they will lose tariff-free trade with our biggest market.\nOur financial services are against Brexit because they will lose their pass-porting rights.\nOur universities are against Brexit because they will lose funding, staff and students.\nOur exporters are against Brexit because if we leave the customs union they won’t be able to trade without goods being detained and checked at borders.\nBut why would we listen to these people – they are only the experts after all.\nWhat happens in the next two years will define the future of our nation for generations.\nIn everything we have heard so far – the soft Brexit, hard Brexit, clean Brexit, grey Brexit and the red, white and blue Brexit – the Government has shown very little understanding of the huge obstacles they must overcome in the next two years, and even less understanding of the devastating consequences of failure.\nWe have decided that we are leaving, but it is the EU nations that decide how we leave and what we end up with.\nArticle 50 is the start of a process, not the end, and this process will be out of our hands as soon as Article 50 is triggered.\nWhere could we end up in 2019? Out of the single market. Out of the customs union. No trade deal with Europe or anywhere else.\nOur only friend a President with a flagrant disregard for human rights.

He says if we must leave, then we need to find a new model and he believes the Norwegian one to be the best although it will cost us more to achieve the same as we already have.

  "https_europeanbritblog_wordpress_com_/https_europeanbritblog_wordpress_com_tag_democracy/content_10.html": "The EU Referendum was democracy in that one side scored more votes than the other. However, this is not a general election where we could vote for a change in five years. This was an enormous decision with far reaching effects in every section of our economy and society.\nThe Scottish referendum included any adult living in Scotland but not Scots living anywhere outside of Scotland. It was not fully inclusive of Scottish opinion and, as it affected the whole of the United Kingdom, it was widely felt that the whole of the UK should have voted, although perhaps with some weighting towards Scottish votes. Where they were modern was to realise it mostly affected future generations so 16/17 year olds were included.\n75% of our under 25s want to stay in the EU yet our 16/17 year olds did not have a vote. That is fundamentally wrong and had Cameron included them, we would be jubilant today and he would still have a job. Asked why this referendum matters to young people, Nick Clegg said,\n“In a fairer world, we’d only give the vote to 16 – 24 year olds because the consequences will fall on their shoulders”\nWe have all the financial uncertainty and questions in our country but this has also triggered a negative, destabilising response across the EU. How is that going to help the poorer nations and the migrants crisis? Is there any way out of this? Can the young people rise up and make their voices heard, demand their representation, without violence?\nWhat about Her Majesty? Is she going to allow this to happen or step in as supreme ruler of our kingdom before it is too late? Perhaps she is another senior citizen who is not thinking about her grandchildren. I wonder what our future kings think?\nThen there is the percentage of the vote. 51.9% of the electorate voted to Leave but that is roughly 17 million of 68 million in our country ie 25%. Is that democracy? I think given the enormity there should have been a requirement for at least a clear 5% majority. Clearly, not enough thought was given to the “what if” scenarios of the result.",

I still feel dazed, in shock and so, so upset. I am literally heartbroken.\nLast Friday, the PM who had called this referendum, David Cameron, resigned. I was angry with him at the time for walking out, abandoning us to the mess his decision had caused. Since then I have watched him, the statesman that he is, doing his best to lead Parliament and find the best solution for the country he loves. I know that inside he too is broken.\nThis was never meant to happen. Cameron wanted to appease the Eurosceptic right-wingers in his party but somehow the scripts were mixed up. We should have shown the arrogant Nigel Farage that whilst he has his supporters, this country is not his to overrun with his racist and rude opinions. Farage on his own was not a votes winner. He needed support to spearhead the campaign. In that he found Boris Johnson, the Etonian boy groomed to be a future PM, just waiting in the wings after his eight years as Mayor of London. Now Boris is clever and he realised that fellow Etonian Cameron would not have the support of the masses. He saw this as his chance to walk triumphantly into No.10.

For the first time in a week I laughed, really laughed. The main who lied and change his support as part of his plan to win the top job has been exposed as a career politician who even put his country to ransom for his ambitions. This is one holy Eton Mess.\nI tweeted that we should take him to the Tower of London, via Traitors Gate and hang him.\nI have always liked Boris, who doesn’t with his incredible charisma?

  "https_europeanbritblog_wordpress_com_/https_europeanbritblog_wordpress_com_tag_europol/content_61.html": "Feel free to plagiarise my letter and write to your own MP.\nDear xxx,\nThe Prime Minister’s Brexit speech outlined what she wants to achieve in negotiations with the EU27 albeit with many idealistic aims rather than plans and in contrast with the Conservative Party Manifesto commitment to remain in the Single Market. Your Leader has demonstrated her wish to sacrifice jobs and business to satisfy the demands to control immigration. Yet as Home Secretary for six years, she had the opportunity to control immigration but chose not to. She could have applied the EU 2004 law whereby EU migrants must prove they have a job, are studying or have financial means to support themselves within three months of arrival. However, she knew that EU migrants actually earn the UK economy far more in net taxation than they cost, a message she is ignoring now to satisfy the right-wing Eurosceptics and constituencies where UKIP are chasing the Conservative vote. How shameful that she is protecting her own position and keeping her government in power to the detriment of the country’s future.\nI am glad that Mrs May has agreed to give Parliament a vote on the final destination but there must also be a vote by the people. This will include (a) all the 15-17 year olds who were too young to vote in 2016 but whose future will be affected and (b) must include UK citizens living in EU27. The outcome of these negotiations affects their rights as UK citizens too. As my MP, I ask you please to demand this vital democratic right.\nI am also pleased that Mrs May has just announced a White Paper on the bill to trigger Article 50 giving all MPs and Peers a chance for full debate and to table amendments. The government lost 80 days and a great deal of taxpayers’ money by choosing to challenge the High Court judgment but must not now rush either House with this vital step.\nAre our acquired rights as EU citizens about to be taken away?\nThe Leave campaign asserted that, in the event of the vote going in their favour, Article 70 of the little known Vienna Convention of 1969 would protect all those rights acquired by UK citizens during the UK’s 44 years of EEC/EC/EU membership.\nI do not believe that the vote to leave provides any mandate to take away our individual rights acquired over 44 years of the UK’s membership of the EEC/EU. Indeed, Lord Neuberger’s statement that “certain rights enjoyed by UK citizens will be changed” appears to be one of the principal reasons that the Supreme Court has ruled that Article 50 cannot be triggered without the approval of Parliament.\nWill “taking back control” mean a loss of acquired rights? The May Administration must answer these questions concerning the rights of UK citizens living in the UK and abroad. Here are a dozen initial questions:\n-\nPost Brexit, will UK citizens be able to study, live, work (employed or self-employed) and retire freely anywhere in EU27?\n-\nWill travelling to EU27 require UK citizens to join separate immigration queues and obtain visas?\n-\nWill UK citizens maintain access to a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) that currently enables them to receive health care free or at reduced cost at the point of use? The EHIC has reduced the cost of travel insurance. Health insurance is vital for UK citizens living in EU27.\n-\nWill UK citizens be able to shop and bring home goods from anywhere in the EU27 (subject to laws concerning illegal or restricted items) without paying tariffs or excise duties?\n-\nWill retired UK citizens in EU27 countries be able to continue living in their country of choice or will they need to reapply for residency and will their state pensions be protected, whether paid by the UK or an EU state?\n-\nWill children of UK citizens working and living in the EU27 still be able to attend local state schools and will secondary education qualifications gained by UK citizens in other EU countries still be recognised for access to UK universities?\n-\nWill children of UK citizens be allowed to attend low cost EU universities? Will they be allowed to remain in the EU27 after taking their degree(s)?\n-\nWill UK workers in the EU27 be subject to the requirements for obtaining a work permit if Freedom of Movement is no longer possible and will their professional and educational qualifications be recognised in the same way as they are today?\n-\nWill they be able to apply to become nationals of their chosen country and so hold dual nationality?\n-\nWill young UK citizens continue to benefit from the Erasmus student exchange programme, which currently allows UK university students to study or work abroad for between 3-12 months and receive free tuition and some living costs from the EU?\n-\nWill the government guarantee that the withdrawal from EU agencies such as Europol and Eurojust will not expose us to greater risks in the fight against serious international crime and terrorism? If so, how will this be done?\n-\nWill the government guarantee that the rights of safety and protection provided through our membership of agencies such as the following will not be impaired, if so, how will this be done?\n-\nEuropean Agency for Health and Safety at Work\n-\nEuropean Aviation Safety Agency\n-\nEuropean Food Safety Authority\n-\nEuropean Medicines Agency\n-\nEuropean Chemicals Agency\nFinally, Charles Goerens MEP proposed that UK citizens who do not wish to lose the rights of EU citizens be granted Associate EU Citizenship and I fully support this idea.\nI look forward to your reply.\nYours sincerely,\nAntonia Harrison",

They said they had applied to join (yes, about two decades ago) and were about to join, probably next year. Truth is, they have satisfied only 1 of 25 criteria and David Cameron said they are unlikely to qualify before 3000. They even produced this scandalous leaflet which did not label Turkey but did label Syria and Iraq emphasising the risk of migrants coming in from these countries through new member Turkey.\nThose who tell lies cannot keep track of the lies they have told.\nLeave a comment",
  "https_europeanbritblog_wordpress_com_/https_europeanbritblog_wordpress_com_tag_obr/content_24.html": "Every now and then a politician brings tears to my eyes and this time it was David Lammy, Labour MP for Tottenham who explained why he would not be voting to trigger Article 50 and so disobey his party’s 3 line whip.\nYou can watch his speech here, or read it below.\nhttp://www.parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/fe6bc3c9-5d0b-4808-ba0b-8ce9c08475c1 starting at 19:42.\nOn Tuesday evening (31st January) I spoke in the Second Reading of the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill.\nMany members of this House have long believed that the United Kingdom’s interests would be best served outside of the European Union.\nThey campaigned passionately for what they believe in and in their view we must now leave the European Union – no ifs, no buts and no questions asked.\nIt would be unfair if I didn’t acknowledge that 52% of those who voted on June 23rd voted to Leave.\nThe Prime Minister says she wants to deliver a Brexit that works for all and a Brexit that unites our divided country.\nI too want to bring this country back together.\nMembers right across this House will have experienced just how divided the country has become in the months leading up to last June and in the months since.\nYoung and old. Graduates and non-graduates. The haves and the have nots. City dwellers and those who live in smaller towns and rural communities.\nUnprecedented, deep divisions of the kind I have not seen in my lifetime.\nBut we cannot bring the country back together if we pretend that the country has spoken with one united voice.\nPeople who voted to Leave voted for all sorts of reasons, many of which had absolutely nothing to do with the European Union.\nI knocked on doors all over the country, from Hornsey to Huddersfield, and a lot of the Brexit voters I spoke to were actually voting against David Cameron and the Conservative Government.\nSome voted for Leave to send a message to Westminster and register a protest vote.\nSome said they were fed up with public services stretched to breaking point.\nSome said they felt trapped and helpless so they voted for Leave because – as one voter put it to me – “well things can’t get any worse, can they?”\nSo when the Prime Minister speaks of “the will of the people”, her interpretation is frankly no clearer or more precise that anyone else’s.\nLet’s not pretend that the people have spoken, because not all of them have.\nIn fact only 27% of the people of this country voted to Leave. 13 million people didn’t vote. Another 7 million eligible voters weren’t registered. 1 million British expatriates weren’t allowed to vote.\n16 year olds were denied a say, even though it was their futures that were on the ballot paper.\nOnly 2 of the 4 nations that make up the United Kingdom voted to Leave. There was no quadruple lock.\nThere was no two-thirds super-majority – which is common in other countries for a constitutional change of this magnitude.\nEven so, we are told that the people have spoken.\nLook at what we have allowed ourselves to become.\nIn a matter of months our public discourse has been consumed by vitriol and abuse. Hate crimes rose 40% in the aftermath of the referendum vote, and we do not yet know what forces our actual departure will unleash.\nIt is easy to dismiss views with which you disagree if you never actually listen to them at all. If you just dismiss the people who hold them as villains or enemies of the people.\nBut it is in those terms that we are being asked to rubber stamp a blank cheque for the Government to deliver the most extreme version of Brexit imaginable.\nWe are being asked to ignore the fact that leaving the European Union will saddle us with a £60 billion divorce bill.\nThe OBR has forecast that Brexit will cost us another £58 billion over the next 5 years. Where will these cuts fall? We’re not even supposed to ask.\nWe are not going to get tariff-free access to EU customers whilst rejecting free movement. That is not on the table.\nWe are not going to get a more favourable trading arrangement with Europe from outside the Single Market. That is a paradox.\nWe are not going to come to a full agreement with Europe within 2 years. Believing otherwise completely flies in the face of precedent and all evidence.\nExiting without a deal and falling back on World Trade Organisation rules is being talked about as if this is a good option. That is totally wrong. It would be an absolute disaster for this country.\nEven on the optimistic assumption that we can sign trade agreements all over the world, this will not even come close to making up for the loss of the single market.\nWe are facing a return to a hard border in Northern Ireland and a breakdown of the union with Scotland.\nWe are not reclaiming sovereignty, another promise that falls apart under any scrutiny. We are just transferring it behind the closed doors of negotiating rooms, where other countries will hold a gun to our heads.\nBut we are being asked to forget about all that.\nOur doctors are against Brexit because our health service will collapse without European staff.\nOur scientists are against Brexit because they will lose research grants and talented researchers.\nOur manufacturers are against it because they will lose tariff-free trade with our biggest market.\nOur financial services are against Brexit because they will lose their pass-porting rights.\nOur universities are against Brexit because they will lose funding, staff and students.\nOur exporters are against Brexit because if we leave the customs union they won’t be able to trade without goods being detained and checked at borders.\nBut why would we listen to these people – they are only the experts after all.\nWhat happens in the next two years will define the future of our nation for generations.\nIn everything we have heard so far – the soft Brexit, hard Brexit, clean Brexit, grey Brexit and the red, white and blue Brexit – the Government has shown very little understanding of the huge obstacles they must overcome in the next two years, and even less understanding of the devastating consequences of failure.\nWe have decided that we are leaving, but it is the EU nations that decide how we leave and what we end up with.\nArticle 50 is the start of a process, not the end, and this process will be out of our hands as soon as Article 50 is triggered.\nWhere could we end up in 2019? Out of the single market. Out of the customs union. No trade deal with Europe or anywhere else.\nOur only friend a President with a flagrant disregard for human rights. Do we really want to let ourselves become the 51st state of Trump’s America?\nWe shouldn’t fool ourselves.\nThis is not, and it never has been a debate about the economy. This has always been a debate about immigration.\nWe are staring down the barrel of a hard Brexit because immigration has been prioritised above all else – even the economy, jobs and living standards.\nDuring the campaign, we were sold the lie that we could cut immigration without hitting our economy.\nWe were sold the lie that immigrants come here and take more than they contribute.\nBetween 1995 and 2011 European immigrants made a net contribution of £4.4 billion to our public finances. In the same period our native population cost us £591 billion.\nEconomic migrants are educated at another country’s expense so they subsidise our public spending on the young, the sick and the elderly.\n78% of working age EU migrants are in work, compared to 74% of UK natives. The employment rate of migrants from the 8 countries that joined the EU in 2004 is over 80%.\nOur economy can’t exist without people coming here to do the jobs that people in this country either don’t want to do or don’t have the right skills to do.\nSo not only will our economy take a hit when we leave the Single Market to control immigration, reducing immigration itself will further hurt our economy and make us poorer.\nAnd another truth that the Leave campaign persuaded us to ignore. Last year more people arrived from outside the EU than from within the EU.\nWhen we go around signing new trade deals, countries will demand visas for their people in return.\nPeople have been told that immigration is going to disappear, but we will just be swapping EU immigration for non-EU immigration.\nThis is a voracious race to the bottom that will never end. And so when things go wrong, the backlash against migrants and minorities will be even worse.\nIt is almost half a century since a Member of this House, in a very different era, made these same warnings of “wives unable to obtain hospital beds in childbirth”, “children unable to obtain school places” and “homes and neighbourhoods changed beyond recognition”.\nHow far we have fallen when a black British Member of Parliament, of African and Caribbean descent, has to stand up and start quoting Enoch Powell.\nOn both sides of the Atlantic we can see the resurgence of far-right nationalism and nativist, xenophobic bigotry. Appeasement and compromise won’t work. It never has and it never will. We must meet it head on, before it’s too late.\nIt is the easy option to blame migrants who come here with skills instead of successive Governments – both Conservative and Labour – who have failed.\nFailed to educate our own to compete.\nFailed to build affordable housing.\nFailed to fund our public services.\nFailed to ensure that growth is felt outside of London and the South East.\nA hard Brexit won’t deal with any of the long-standing, structural problems highlighted by the Brexit vote. It will make them worse.\nThe real tragedy is that with Whitehall and Parliament so consumed with Brexit for the next 10 years, we will have no capacity to address these problems.\nLondon and the South East are the only regions where GDP per person is higher today than it was in 2007. Everywhere else, people are worse off than they were before the credit crunch.\nOur economy is an hour glass, with the middle section hollowed out.\nThe middle rungs of the ladder – the breadwinner jobs that paid enough to raise a family on have disappeared. We now only have an asset class and an under-class.\nPoverty is no longer an issue that afflicts the workless. More than half of all people who are in poverty – 7 and a half million in our country – are in a working family.\nReal wages have fallen by 5% since 2009. And at the same time, the average property owner in London makes more money per year from the increased value of their home than the average London salary.\nI will not take lectures about listening to left behind communities.\nI have seen two riots in a generation in Tottenham.\nMy constituents have borne the brunt of austerity since 2010, and it is they who will pay the price of a hard Brexit.\nChild poverty is at 40%. The council spends £20 million a year on bed and breakfasts just to keep families off the street.\nSo I will not betray my constituents by standing by and staying silent as this recklessness drives our economy off a cliff.\nMembers opposite have been dreaming of a low-tax, low-wage, low-regulation offshore tax haven for decades, and now they have it in their grasp they salivate at the thought of us becoming the new Singapore.\nI will not stand with them.\nIf we let the Prime Minister pursue this reckless course – this Brexit at any cost – we know that as always it will be the poor, the weak and the vulnerable who suffer.\nThe referendum was not simply the rebellion of working class Labour heartlands that has been portrayed.\n52% of Leave votes lived in the South of England. 59% were middle class. 58% of those who voted Conservative in 2015 voted Leave in 2016.\nColleagues on these benches must remember who the Labour Party represents – the very people and communities who will pay the price. This is not the time to stay silent or fall into line.\nHow can you walk into the voting lobby shoulder to shoulder with the party of Nigel Farage and the very people whose vision of society we all went into politics to oppose?\nAnd as for Members opposite, where are you? Where are your better instincts? Why have you rolled over and given in to the hard Brexiteers, who have always been on the fringes of your party but who have never, until now, been in the driving seat?\nThis is not a time to put self-interest or party interest ahead of the national interest. There is too much at stake.\nLet me finish by asking just one simple question, once asked by one of our most celebrated Parliamentarians.\n“Is it prudent, is it even possible, however much we might desire it, to turn our backs upon Europe?”\nWhen Churchill spoke those words, he was talking about appeasement and he was going very much against the prevailing wind. The same is true today.\nPatriotism requires more than blind faith. We must remember our history, our values, what we represent and what we stand for. Most of all, we should remember what we stand against.\nFor all of these reasons, and for the sake of the country that I love, I will be voting against the triggering of Article 50.”\nWhat a speech. My thanks to him and all the MPs who voted against the triggering of Article 50 for similar reasons, who put their conscience and patriotism before their career.",

City dwellers and those who live in smaller towns and rural communities.\nUnprecedented, deep divisions of the kind I have not seen in my lifetime.\nBut we cannot bring the country back together if we pretend that the country has spoken with one united voice.\nPeople who voted to Leave voted for all sorts of reasons, many of which had absolutely nothing to do with the European Union.\nI knocked on doors all over the country, from Hornsey to Huddersfield, and a lot of the Brexit voters I spoke to were actually voting against David Cameron and the Conservative Government.\nSome voted for Leave to send a message to Westminster and register a protest vote.\nSome said they were fed up with public services stretched to breaking point.\nSome said they felt trapped and helpless so they voted for Leave because – as one voter put it to me – “well things can’t get any worse, can they?”\nSo when the Prime Minister speaks of “the will of the people”, her interpretation is frankly no clearer or more precise that anyone else’s.\nLet’s not pretend that the people have spoken, because not all of them have.\nIn fact only 27% of the people of this country voted to Leave. 13 million people didn’t vote. Another 7 million eligible voters weren’t registered. 1 million British expatriates weren’t allowed to vote.\n16 year olds were denied a say, even though it was their futures that were on the ballot paper.\nOnly 2 of the 4 nations that make up the United Kingdom voted to Leave. There was no quadruple lock.\nThere was no two-thirds super-majority – which is common in other countries for a constitutional change of this magnitude.\nEven so, we are told that the people have spoken.\nLook at what we have allowed ourselves to become.\nIn a matter of months our public discourse has been consumed by vitriol and abuse. Hate crimes rose 40% in the aftermath of the referendum vote, and we do not yet know what forces our actual departure will unleash.\nIt is easy to dismiss views with which you disagree if you never actually listen to them at all. If you just dismiss the people who hold them as villains or enemies of the people.\nBut it is in those terms that we are being asked to rubber stamp a blank cheque for the Government to deliver the most extreme version of Brexit imaginable.\nWe are being asked to ignore the fact that leaving the European Union will saddle us with a £60 billion divorce bill.\nThe OBR has forecast that Brexit will cost us another £58 billion over the next 5 years. Where will these cuts fall? We’re not even supposed to ask.\nWe are not going to get tariff-free access to EU customers whilst rejecting free movement. That is not on the table.\nWe are not going to get a more favourable trading arrangement with Europe from outside the Single Market. That is a paradox.\nWe are not going to come to a full agreement with Europe within 2 years. Believing otherwise completely flies in the face of precedent and all evidence.\nExiting without a deal and falling back on World Trade Organisation rules is being talked about as if this is a good option. That is totally wrong. It would be an absolute disaster for this country.\nEven on the optimistic assumption that we can sign trade agreements all over the world, this will not even come close to making up for the loss of the single market.\nWe are facing a return to a hard border in Northern Ireland and a breakdown of the union with Scotland.\nWe are not reclaiming sovereignty, another promise that falls apart under any scrutiny. We are just transferring it behind the closed doors of negotiating rooms, where other countries will hold a gun to our heads.\nBut we are being asked to forget about all that.\nOur doctors are against Brexit because our health service will collapse without European staff.\nOur scientists are against Brexit because they will lose research grants and talented researchers.\nOur manufacturers are against it because they will lose tariff-free trade with our biggest market.\nOur financial services are against Brexit because they will lose their pass-porting rights.\nOur universities are against Brexit because they will lose funding, staff and students.\nOur exporters are against Brexit because if we leave the customs union they won’t be able to trade without goods being detained and checked at borders.\nBut why would we listen to these people – they are only the experts after all.\nWhat happens in the next two years will define the future of our nation for generations.\nIn everything we have heard so far – the soft Brexit, hard Brexit, clean Brexit, grey Brexit and the red, white and blue Brexit – the Government has shown very little understanding of the huge obstacles they must overcome in the next two years, and even less understanding of the devastating consequences of failure.\nWe have decided that we are leaving, but it is the EU nations that decide how we leave and what we end up with.\nArticle 50 is the start of a process, not the end, and this process will be out of our hands as soon as Article 50 is triggered.\nWhere could we end up in 2019? Out of the single market. Out of the customs union. No trade deal with Europe or anywhere else.\nOur only friend a President with a flagrant disregard for human rights. Do we really want to let ourselves become the 51st state of Trump’s America?\nWe shouldn’t fool ourselves.\nThis is not, and it never has been a debate about the economy. This has always been a debate about immigration.\nWe are staring down the barrel of a hard Brexit because immigration has been prioritised above all else – even the economy, jobs and living standards.\nDuring the campaign, we were sold the lie that we could cut immigration without hitting our economy.\nWe were sold the lie that immigrants come here and take more than they contribute.\nBetween 1995 and 2011 European immigrants made a net contribution of £4.4 billion to our public finances. In the same period our native population cost us £591 billion.\nEconomic migrants are educated at another country’s expense so they subsidise our public spending on the young, the sick and the elderly.\n78% of working age EU migrants are in work, compared to 74% of UK natives. The employment rate of migrants from the 8 countries that joined the EU in 2004 is over 80%.\nOur economy can’t exist without people coming here to do the jobs that people in this country either don’t want to do or don’t have the right skills to do.\nSo not only will our economy take a hit when we leave the Single Market to control immigration, reducing immigration itself will further hurt our economy and make us poorer.\nAnd another truth that the Leave campaign persuaded us to ignore. Last year more people arrived from outside the EU than from within the EU.\nWhen we go around signing new trade deals, countries will demand visas for their people in return.\nPeople have been told that immigration is going to disappear, but we will just be swapping EU immigration for non-EU immigration.\nThis is a voracious race to the bottom that will never end. And so when things go wrong, the backlash against migrants and minorities will be even worse.\nIt is almost half a century since a Member of this House, in a very different era, made these same warnings of “wives unable to obtain hospital beds in childbirth”, “children unable to obtain school places” and “homes and neighbourhoods changed beyond recognition”.\nHow far we have fallen when a black British Member of Parliament, of African and Caribbean descent, has to stand up and start quoting Enoch Powell.\nOn both sides of the Atlantic we can see the resurgence of far-right nationalism and nativist, xenophobic bigotry. Appeasement and compromise won’t work. It never has and it never will. We must meet it head on, before it’s too late.\nIt is the easy option to blame migrants who come here with skills instead of successive Governments – both Conservative and Labour – who have failed.\nFailed to educate our own to compete.\nFailed to build affordable housing.\nFailed to fund our public services.\nFailed to ensure that growth is felt outside of London and the South East.\nA hard Brexit won’t deal with any of the long-standing, structural problems highlighted by the Brexit vote. It will make them worse.\nThe real tragedy is that with Whitehall and Parliament so consumed with Brexit for the next 10 years, we will have no capacity to address these problems.\nLondon and the South East are the only regions where GDP per person is higher today than it was in 2007. Everywhere else, people are worse off than they were before the credit crunch.\nOur economy is an hour glass, with the middle section hollowed out.\nThe middle rungs of the ladder – the breadwinner jobs that paid enough to raise a family on have disappeared. We now only have an asset class and an under-class.\nPoverty is no longer an issue that afflicts the workless. More than half of all people who are in poverty – 7 and a half million in our country – are in a working family.\nReal wages have fallen by 5% since 2009. And at the same time, the average property owner in London makes more money per year from the increased value of their home than the average London salary.\nI will not take lectures about listening to left behind communities.\nI have seen two riots in a generation in Tottenham.\nMy constituents have borne the brunt of austerity since 2010, and it is they who will pay the price of a hard Brexit.\nChild poverty is at 40%. The council spends £20 million a year on bed and breakfasts just to keep families off the street.\nSo I will not betray my constituents by standing by and staying silent as this recklessness drives our economy off a cliff.\nMembers opposite have been dreaming of a low-tax, low-wage, low-regulation offshore tax haven for decades, and now they have it in their grasp they salivate at the thought of us becoming the new Singapore.\nI will not stand with them.\nIf we let the Prime Minister pursue this reckless course – this Brexit at any cost – we know that as always it will be the poor, the weak and the vulnerable who suffer.\nThe referendum was not simply the rebellion of working class Labour heartlands that has been portrayed.\n52% of Leave votes lived in the South of England. 59% were middle class. 58% of those who voted Conservative in 2015 voted Leave in 2016.\nColleagues on these benches must remember who the Labour Party represents – the very people and communities who will pay the price. This is not the time to stay silent or fall into line.\nHow can you walk into the voting lobby shoulder to shoulder with the party of Nigel Farage and the very people whose vision of society we all went into politics to oppose?\nAnd as for Members opposite, where are you? Where are your better instincts? Why have you rolled over and given in to the hard Brexiteers, who have always been on the fringes of your party but who have never, until now, been in the driving seat?\nThis is not a time to put self-interest or party interest ahead of the national interest. There is too much at stake.\nLet me finish by asking just one simple question, once asked by one of our most celebrated Parliamentarians.\n“Is it prudent, is it even possible, however much we might desire it, to turn our backs upon Europe?”\nWhen Churchill spoke those words, he was talking about appeasement and he was going very much against the prevailing wind. The same is true today.\nPatriotism requires more than blind faith. We must remember our history, our values, what we represent and what we stand for. Most of all, we should remember what we stand against.\nFor all of these reasons, and for the sake of the country that I love, I will be voting against the triggering of Article 50.”\nWhat a speech. My thanks to him and all the MPs who voted against the triggering of Article 50 for similar reasons, who put their conscience and patriotism before their career.",
  "https_europeanbritblog_wordpress_com_/https_europeanbritblog_wordpress_com_category_tory-leadership-contest/content_73.html": "When Michael Gove, the pro-Brexit Justice Secretary, was told by Faisal Islam of Sky News that “the leaders of the US, India, China, Australia, every single one of our allies, the Bank of England, the IFS, IMF, the CBI, five former Nato secretary generals and the Chief Executive of the NHS” were all against Britain’s exit, the response was remarkable.\n“I think the people of this country have had enough of experts”.\nFaisal Islam was understandably dumbfounded by such a stupid statement from a very intelligent man.\nMichael Gove is jointly culpable for Brexit, for the sharp decline in the value of the Pound, the dramatic losses in our investments and pension funds and the fall in our credit rating. Now while some of these short term responses may be corrected in the short term, that does not help businesses today with higher cost for importing of materials and services, nor holiday makers who will have 8€ or 11 € less per £.\nIt was widely expected that Boris Johnson would be the clear favourite to stand as PM and Michael Gove would be his running mate but Gove’s wife, Sarah Vine, “accidentally” leaked an email, destined for him, to a member of the public advising him to be absolutely sure that Boris promised him a top job before lending his support. The next day, Gove, despite all his previous assurances since 2012 that he would not and could not stand as PM, went back on his word and stood for election. Boris responded by not standing.\nMichael Gove is not to be trusted. There is an expression, which is surprisingly from Gavin Esler in “A Scrupulous Man” and not Shakespeare, so often the author of our favourite expressions:\n“He who wields the knife rarely inherits the crown”.\nMichael Gove is one of the Gang of Three (Farage-Johnson-Gove) who duped the public with falsehoods regarding the information on which millions of people based their Remain/Leave vote. Although they thought the public would vote Remain, they are responsible for the constitutional mess that the country finds itself in and the knock-on effect to our European partners and indeed, the worldwide economy. Although there are suggestions that a Brexiteer should lead the country in negotiations post triggering Article 50, there is no way that Gove should be rewarded with the glittering prize. He deceived the country and our memories will not be short.\nFurthermore, with the reforms Michael Gove made as Education Secretary, he is widely hated by teachers and parents of children who will sit GCSE from 2017 onwards – including my son. If the Tories choose Gove as their leader, they are unlikely to win in a General Election. By all means Tories, choose the man with the bloody dagger.\nPS Does anyone else think he sounds like Michael McIntyre?",

Your Leader has demonstrated her wish to sacrifice jobs and business to satisfy the demands to control immigration. Yet as Home Secretary for six years, she had the opportunity to control immigration but chose not to. She could have applied the EU 2004 law whereby EU migrants must prove they have a job, are studying or have financial means to support themselves within three months of arrival. However, she knew that EU migrants actually earn the UK economy far more in net taxation than they cost, a message she is ignoring now to satisfy the right-wing Eurosceptics and constituencies where UKIP are chasing the Conservative vote. How shameful that she is protecting her own position and keeping her government in power to the detriment of the country’s future.\nI am glad that Mrs May has agreed to give Parliament a vote on the final destination but there must also be a vote by the people. This will include (a) all the 15-17 year olds who were too young to vote in 2016 but whose future will be affected and (b) must include UK citizens living in EU27. The outcome of these negotiations affects their rights as UK citizens too. As my MP, I ask you please to demand this vital democratic right.\nI am also pleased that Mrs May has just announced a White Paper on the bill to trigger Article 50 giving all MPs and Peers a chance for full debate and to table amendments. The government lost 80 days and a great deal of taxpayers’ money by choosing to challenge the High Court judgment but must not now rush either House with this vital step.\nAre our acquired rights as EU citizens about to be taken away?\nThe Leave campaign asserted that, in the event of the vote going in their favour, Article 70 of the little known Vienna Convention of 1969 would protect all those rights acquired by UK citizens during the UK’s 44 years of EEC/EC/EU membership.\nI do not believe that the vote to leave provides any mandate to take away our individual rights acquired over 44 years of the UK’s membership of the EEC/EU. Indeed, Lord Neuberger’s statement that “certain rights enjoyed by UK citizens will be changed” appears to be one of the principal reasons that the Supreme Court has ruled that Article 50 cannot be triggered without the approval of Parliament.\nWill “taking back control” mean a loss of acquired rights? The May Administration must answer these questions concerning the rights of UK citizens living in the UK and abroad. Here are a dozen initial questions:\n-\nPost Brexit, will UK citizens be able to study, live, work (employed or self-employed) and retire freely anywhere in EU27?\n-\nWill travelling to EU27 require UK citizens to join separate immigration queues and obtain visas?\n-\nWill UK citizens maintain access to a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) that currently enables them to receive health care free or at reduced cost at the point of use? The EHIC has reduced the cost of travel insurance. Health insurance is vital for UK citizens living in EU27.\n-\nWill UK citizens be able to shop and bring home goods from anywhere in the EU27 (subject to laws concerning illegal or restricted items) without paying tariffs or excise duties?\n-\nWill retired UK citizens in EU27 countries be able to continue living in their country of choice or will they need to reapply for residency and will their state pensions be protected, whether paid by the UK or an EU state?\n-\nWill children of UK citizens working and living in the EU27 still be able to attend local state schools and will secondary education qualifications gained by UK citizens in other EU countries still be recognised for access to UK universities?\n-\nWill children of UK citizens be allowed to attend low cost EU universities? Will they be allowed to remain in the EU27 after taking their degree(s)?\n-\nWill UK workers in the EU27 be subject to the requirements for obtaining a work permit if Freedom of Movement is no longer possible and will their professional and educational qualifications be recognised in the same way as they are today?\n-\nWill they be able to apply to become nationals of their chosen country and so hold dual nationality?\n-\nWill young UK citizens continue to benefit from the Erasmus student exchange programme, which currently allows UK university students to study or work abroad for between 3-12 months and receive free tuition and some living costs from the EU?\n-\nWill the government guarantee that the withdrawal from EU agencies such as Europol and Eurojust will not expose us to greater risks in the fight against serious international crime and terrorism? If so, how will this be done?\n-\nWill the government guarantee that the rights of safety and protection provided through our membership of agencies such as the following will not be impaired, if so, how will this be done?\n-\nEuropean Agency for Health and Safety at Work\n-\nEuropean Aviation Safety Agency\n-\nEuropean Food Safety Authority\n-\nEuropean Medicines Agency\n-\nEuropean Chemicals Agency\nFinally, Charles Goerens MEP proposed that UK citizens who do not wish to lose the rights of EU citizens be granted Associate EU Citizenship and I fully support this idea.\nI look forward to your reply.\nYours sincerely,\nAntonia Harrison",

Appeasement and compromise won’t work. It never has and it never will. We must meet it head on, before it’s too late.\nIt is the easy option to blame migrants who come here with skills instead of successive Governments – both Conservative and Labour – who have failed.\nFailed to educate our own to compete.\nFailed to build affordable housing.\nFailed to fund our public services.\nFailed to ensure that growth is felt outside of London and the South East.\nA hard Brexit won’t deal with any of the long-standing, structural problems highlighted by the Brexit vote. It will make them worse.\nThe real tragedy is that with Whitehall and Parliament so consumed with Brexit for the next 10 years, we will have no capacity to address these problems.\nLondon and the South East are the only regions where GDP per person is higher today than it was in 2007. Everywhere else, people are worse off than they were before the credit crunch.\nOur economy is an hour glass, with the middle section hollowed out.\nThe middle rungs of the ladder – the breadwinner jobs that paid enough to raise a family on have disappeared. We now only have an asset class and an under-class.\nPoverty is no longer an issue that afflicts the workless. More than half of all people who are in poverty – 7 and a half million in our country – are in a working family.\nReal wages have fallen by 5% since 2009. And at the same time, the average property owner in London makes more money per year from the increased value of their home than the average London salary.\nI will not take lectures about listening to left behind communities.\nI have seen two riots in a generation in Tottenham.\nMy constituents have borne the brunt of austerity since 2010, and it is they who will pay the price of a hard Brexit.\nChild poverty is at 40%. The council spends £20 million a year on bed and breakfasts just to keep families off the street.\nSo I will not betray my constituents by standing by and staying silent as this recklessness drives our economy off a cliff.\nMembers opposite have been dreaming of a low-tax, low-wage, low-regulation offshore tax haven for decades, and now they have it in their grasp they salivate at the thought of us becoming the new Singapore.\nI will not stand with them.\nIf we let the Prime Minister pursue this reckless course – this Brexit at any cost – we know that as always it will be the poor, the weak and the vulnerable who suffer.\nThe referendum was not simply the rebellion of working class Labour heartlands that has been portrayed.\n52% of Leave votes lived in the South of England. 59% were middle class. 58% of those who voted Conservative in 2015 voted Leave in 2016.\nColleagues on these benches must remember who the Labour Party represents – the very people and communities who will pay the price. This is not the time to stay silent or fall into line.\nHow can you walk into the voting lobby shoulder to shoulder with the party of Nigel Farage and the very people whose vision of society we all went into politics to oppose?\nAnd as for Members opposite, where are you? Where are your better instincts? Why have you rolled over and given in to the hard Brexiteers, who have always been on the fringes of your party but who have never, until now, been in the driving seat?\nThis is not a time to put self-interest or party interest ahead of the national interest. There is too much at stake.\nLet me finish by asking just one simple question, once asked by one of our most celebrated Parliamentarians.\n“Is it prudent, is it even possible, however much we might desire it, to turn our backs upon Europe?”\nWhen Churchill spoke those words, he was talking about appeasement and he was going very much against the prevailing wind. The same is true today.\nPatriotism requires more than blind faith. We must remember our history, our values, what we represent and what we stand for. Most of all, we should remember what we stand against.\nFor all of these reasons, and for the sake of the country that I love, I will be voting against the triggering of Article 50.”\nWhat a speech. My thanks to him and all the MPs who voted against the triggering of Article 50 for similar reasons, who put their conscience and patriotism before their career.",
  "https_europeanbritblog_wordpress_com_/https_europeanbritblog_wordpress_com_tag_international-baccalaureate/content_55.html": "I am European to the core, more than I have ever called myself British. I started learning French at 4, moved to Brussels at 19 and later Spain. In all, I lived a total of 16 years in EU countries. I now speak fluent French and Dutch, fluent but rusty Spanish, fairly intermediate German and some holiday Italian, even a few words of Polish and Turkish. I have friends and networking acquaintances in various countries.\nMy 18 year old son who planned to work at the EU Commission as I did, then hopefully become a MEP, feels he has lost his identity. He is fluent in Dutch, has studied Spanish and Latin to Higher Level of the International Baccalaureate rather than A Levels, holds grade A* GCSE’s in Italian and French and studied Mandarin, Russian and a little Greek. Not your average English boy. He is about to start his degree course in International Relations and Sustainability with a year abroad in an EU university – if he is allowed to.\nIf Brexit succeeds and is the start of extreme right governments taking over here and succeeding in other EU countries, leading to the eventual break-up of the European Union, then I no longer want to call myself British. We will be hated. We will be spat at in the streets when we go on holiday. British workers abroad will start to receive hateful messages just as EU migrants have been the recipients of disgraceful racism over the last few days.\nWe have to fight for Europe. It is not time to shut up and move on gracefully. It is time to get really angry. Our forefathers fought for Europe. Our children need us to now.",
  "https_europeanbritblog_wordpress_com_/https_europeanbritblog_wordpress_com_tag_faisal-islam/content_72.html": "When Michael Gove, the pro-Brexit Justice Secretary, was told by Faisal Islam of Sky News that “the leaders of the US, India, China, Australia, every single one of our allies, the Bank of England, the IFS, IMF, the CBI, five former Nato secretary generals and the Chief Executive of the NHS” were all against Britain’s exit, the response was remarkable.\n“I think the people of this country have had enough of experts”.\nFaisal Islam was understandably dumbfounded by such a stupid statement from a very intelligent man.\nMichael Gove is jointly culpable for Brexit, for the sharp decline in the value of the Pound, the dramatic losses in our investments and pension funds and the fall in our credit rating. Now while some of these short term responses may be corrected in the short term, that does not help businesses today with higher cost for importing of materials and services, nor holiday makers who will have 8€ or 11 € less per £.\nIt was widely expected that Boris Johnson would be the clear favourite to stand as PM and Michael Gove would be his running mate but Gove’s wife, Sarah Vine, “accidentally” leaked an email, destined for him, to a member of the public advising him to be absolutely sure that Boris promised him a top job before lending his support. The next day, Gove, despite all his previous assurances since 2012 that he would not and could not stand as PM, went back on his word and stood for election. Boris responded by not standing.\nMichael Gove is not to be trusted. There is an expression, which is surprisingly from Gavin Esler in “A Scrupulous Man” and not Shakespeare, so often the author of our favourite expressions:\n“He who wields the knife rarely inherits the crown”.\nMichael Gove is one of the Gang of Three (Farage-Johnson-Gove) who duped the public with falsehoods regarding the information on which millions of people based their Remain/Leave vote. Although they thought the public would vote Remain, they are responsible for the constitutional mess that the country finds itself in and the knock-on effect to our European partners and indeed, the worldwide economy. Although there are suggestions that a Brexiteer should lead the country in negotiations post triggering Article 50, there is no way that Gove should be rewarded with the glittering prize. He deceived the country and our memories will not be short.\nFurthermore, with the reforms Michael Gove made as Education Secretary, he is widely hated by teachers and parents of children who will sit GCSE from 2017 onwards – including my son. If the Tories choose Gove as their leader, they are unlikely to win in a General Election. By all means Tories, choose the man with the bloody dagger.\nPS Does anyone else think he sounds like Michael McIntyre?"
