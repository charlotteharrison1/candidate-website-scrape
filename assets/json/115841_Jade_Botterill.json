WHEN WE WILL SHARE YOUR DATA\nWe will never sell your personal data to any other organisation and we will not share your personal data unless it is obvious that this is what we are going to do (such as the signing of a petition). We may share your data:\n-\nTo enable transfers to take place (where appropriate);\n-\nWhere we need to comply with a legal obligation; and/or\n-\nWith suppliers who act as our ‘data processors’ and who provide the means of processing financial transactions including, but not limited to Jade Botterill for Ossett and Denby Dale/The Labour Party, Stripe, PayPal and others.\n7.

DATA SECURITY\nWe have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed.

We may retain your personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you.\nTo determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.\n15. YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS\nAs a data subject, you have a number of rights in relation to your personal data. Below, we have described the various rights that you have, as well as how you can exercise them.\nRight of access\nYou may, at any time, request access to the personal data that we hold which relates to you (you may have heard of this right being described as a “subject access request“).\nWe follow the ICO’s “Subject Access Code of Practice” when dealing with requests for access to personal data. You can read this code by visiting https://ico.org.uk/media/for-organisations/documents/2014223/subject-access-code-of-practice.pdf.\nPlease note that this right entitles you to receive a copy of the personal data that we hold about you in order to enable you to check that it is correct and to ensure that we are processing that personal data lawfully. It is not a right that allows you to request personal data about other people, or a right to request specific documents from us that do not relate to or contain your personal data.\nYou can exercise this right at any time by contacting us at jade@jadebotterill.com and telling us that you are making a subject access request. You do not have to fill in a specific form to make this kind of request.\nYour right to rectification and erasure\nYou may, at any time, request that we correct personal data that we hold about you which you believe is incorrect or inaccurate. You may also ask us to erase personal data if you do not believe that we need to continue retaining it (you may have heard of this right described as the “right to be forgotten“).\nPlease note that we may ask you to verify any new data that you provide to us and may take our own steps to check that the new data you have supplied us with is right. Further, we are not always obliged to erase personal data when asked to do so; if for any reason we believe that we have a good legal reason to continue processing personal data that you ask us to erase, we will tell you what that reason is at the time we respond to your request.\nYou can exercise this right at any time by contacting us at jade@jadebotterill.com and telling us that you are making a request to have your personal data rectified or erased and on what basis you are making that request. If you want us to replace inaccurate data with new data, you should tell us what that new data is. You do not have to fill in a specific form to make this kind of request.\nYour right to restrict processing\nWhere we process your personal data on the basis of a legitimate interest (see the sections of this privacy policy which explain how and why we use your information), you are entitled to ask us to stop processing it in that way if you feel that our continuing to do so impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms or if you feel that those legitimate interests are not valid.\nYou may also ask us to stop processing your personal data: (a) if you dispute the accuracy of that personal data and want us to verify that data’s accuracy; (b) where it has been established that our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; or (c) where we no longer need to process your personal data (and would otherwise dispose of it) but you wish for us to continue storing it in order to enable you to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.\nPlease note that if for any reason we believe that we have a good legal reason to continue processing personal data that you ask us to stop processing, we will tell you what that reason is, either at the time we first respond to your request or after we have had the opportunity to consider and investigate it. You can exercise this right at any time by contacting us at jade@jadebotterill.com and telling us that you are making a request to have us stop processing the relevant aspect of your personal data and describing which of the above conditions you believe is relevant to that request. You do not have to fill in a specific form to make this kind of request.\nYour right to portability\nWhere you wish to transfer certain personal data that we hold about you, which is processed by automated means you may write to us and ask us to provide it to you in a commonly used machine-readable format.\nBecause of the kind of the nature of our work do and the systems that we use, we do not envisage this right being particularly relevant to the majority of individuals with whom we interact. However, if you wish to transfer your data from us to a third party, we are happy to consider such requests in good faith.\nYour right to stop receiving communications\nAs noted above, where we send you email marketing communications (or other regulated electronic messages) you have the right to opt-out at any time. You can do this by using the ‘unsubscribe’ link that appears in the footer of each communication (or the equivalent mechanism in those communications).\nAlternatively, if for any reason you cannot use those links, or if you would prefer to contact us directly – you can unsubscribe by contacting us at jade@jadebotterill.com and telling us which communications you would like us to stop sending you.\nYour right to object to automated decision making and profiling\nYou have the right to be informed about the existence of any automated decision making and profiling of your personal data, and where appropriate, be provided with meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of such processing that affects you.\nExercising your rights\nWhen you write to us making a request to exercise your rights, we are entitled to ask you to prove that you are who you say you are. We may ask you to provide copies of relevant ID documents to help us to verify your identity. This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.\nIt will help us to process your request if you clearly state which right you wish to exercise and, where relevant, why it is that you are exercising it. The clearer and more specific you can be, the faster and more efficiently we can deal with your request. If you do not provide us with sufficient information, then we may delay actioning your request until you have provided us with additional information (and where this is the case, we will tell you).\nYou will not usually have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.\nWe try to respond to all legitimate requests within one (1) month. However, it could take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or if you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you of this and keep you updated.\n16. RIGHT TO LODGE A COMPLAINT\nIf you are unhappy with the way that we have processed or handled your data then you have a right to complain to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO). The ICO is the supervisory body authorised by the Data Protection Act 2018 to regulate the handling of personal data within the United Kingdom.\nThe contact details for the ICO are:\n-\nInformation Commissioner’s Office, Wycliffe House, Water Lane, Wilmslow, SK9 5AF\n-\nTelephone: 0303 123 1113\n-\nWebsite: https://ico.org.uk/concerns/\nLast updated: 24/08/23"
