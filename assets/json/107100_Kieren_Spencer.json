I’ve always had a deep passion for the place I’m lucky enough to call home. Even back in school, as a member of the Ribble Valley Youth Council. Since then, I've been honoured to serve as both a Town Councillor and Borough Councillor, advocating for the needs of our community. With the county elections approaching, I’d be delighted to represent you and your families at Lancashire County Council. I want to be a voice for our town, villages, and countryside, working to ensure that our corner of the world continues to be a wonderful place to live, work, and enjoy for generations to come.\nLongridge with Bowland\nLongridge, Ribchester, Chipping, Waddington, Knowle Green, Dunsop Bridge, Slaidburn, Whitewell, Newton-In-Bowland, Bashall Eves, Tosside, Thornley-with-Wheatley, Forest of Bowland.",

Politics doesn’t have to be stuffy, and I hope this shows that I’m someone who’ll always take the work seriously, but never take myself too seriously.\nThe video is split into three distinct and simple sections:\n1. Local Lad I was born and raised right here Longridge in the Ribble Valley – I went to school in Longridge, volunteered for the community from a young age, and this place has shaped who I am. I talk a bit about those early childhood/adolescence experiences and how they gave me a lifelong passion for helping others in our community.\n2. Experience and a Proven Track Record From the projects I have undertaken and service I have given, I’ve built up the skills and understanding to get things done. And as your local councillor on both Longridge Town Council and Ribble Valley Borough Council, I’ve already been standing up for our towns, villages and countryside.\n3. A Local Election, Not National Politics This campaign isn’t about Westminster – it’s about our roads, our schools, and our communities. I talk about what a county councillor actually does, and how I’d use the role to make a difference locally.\nIf the video it resonates with you, I’d be really grateful if you shared it with friends, family or neighbours who might be interested. Every view, every share, and every conversation helps.\nThanks so much for all the support so far – and I hope the video gives you a good sense of what I’m about.\nAll the best,\nKieren Spencer",

  "https_www_kierenspencer_com_/https_www_kierenspencer_com_post_listening-first-to-what-you-told/content_6.html": "🗣️ Listening First: Here's What You've Told Me\n- Kieren Spencer\n- Apr 23\n- 2 min read\nTaking On Board What You Told Me On The Doorstep, In The Street At Our Community Halls And Over Social Media\nOver the past few weeks, I’ve been out and about right across Longridge with Bowland – knocking on doors, chatting to people at community events, catching up in the shops, and hearing from residents online. One thing’s clear: people care deeply about our area, and they want a councillor who listens and acts.\nAnd that’s exactly what I’m here to do.\nFrom Longridge to Slaidburn/Bashall Eves to Chipping, I’ve been asking the same simple question: what matters most to you? Whether it’s been a quick hello on the high street or a longer conversation over a brew at a coffee morning, your answers have helped shape the priorities I’ll be taking forward in this campaign – and beyond.\nHere’s just some of what you’ve told me:\nPotholes and broken roads are a constant frustration – and not just an inconvenience, but a real hazard, especially in rural areas and not just for motorists but for cyclists too.\nReviving our high streets came up again and again – people want to see more support for local businesses, efforts to bring empty shops back into use, and town centres that feel welcoming and vibrant.\nPublic transport – especially bus routes – is a huge issue, with many residents feeling cut off or forced to rely on cars and people who dont drive feeling isolated, especially those in rural areas.\nImproving education and support in our schools is a top concern. Parents and carers have told me they want higher standards in classrooms and better support for children with Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND). No child should be left behind because they can’t get the help they need.\nProtecting and investing in rural services and community facilities is something I’ve heard loud and clear. In villages across the ward, people told me how vital it is to keep spaces like village halls going – not just as venues for events, but as lifelines for connection, support and belonging. These halls host coffee mornings, children’s groups, fitness classes, charity fundraisers and more – they’re the heart of community life, and we need to make sure they have the funding and support to thrive.\nAnd there were thoughtful conversations about social care, the environment, affordable housing, and how we deliver more activities for young people and look after older people too.\nI’ve taken all of this on board. And it’s helping to shape the promises I’m making – not vague pledges or empty slogans, but practical steps that reflect what you’re actually asking for.\nIf I’m elected as your county councillor, I’ll keep being visible, keep being available, and most importantly, keep listening. This isn’t a one-off exercise – your views will continue to shape what I do, how I prioritise my work, and how I speak up for our community at County Hall.\nSo whether I’ve bumped into you in Booths (or lets face it, more likely in the pub (cough cough)), had a chat on your doorstep, or read your message online – thank you. Your voice is at the heart of everything I’m doing.\nLet’s keep the conversation going.\nWarm wishes,\nKieren Spencer",
  "https_www_kierenspencer_com_/https_www_kierenspencer_com_me/content_3.html": "Meet Me\nRooted in Longridge\nI'm a local lad, raised in Longridge, and proud to be standing as your Labour candidate for Lancashire County Council.\nI’ve grown up in our community. I went to St Wilfrid’s Primary and St Cecilia’s High School before heading out of town to Runshaw College and Liverpool Hope University, where I studied (and yes, occasionally studied a bit too hard in the students’ union). I’ve always had a passion for public service – I was the student rep at high school, college and university and haven’t really stopped speaking up for people since.\nMy journey in community service started from an early age. I practically grew up in Longridge Youth Club – the youth workers there were like a second family, and I owe them a lot. That place gave me confidence, purpose, and a sense of belonging. It breaks my heart to see it barely open these days, knowing how much it gave to young people like me.\nI got stuck in from being a teenager, joining the Ribble Valley Youth Council and taking on my first community project: helping to get the “Welcome to Longridge” stone installed on the way into town. It might seem like a small thing, but it was my first real taste of rolling up my sleeves and making something happen for the area I love. I’ve been hooked ever since.\nExperience You Can Trust\nBefore stepping into politics, I ran a successful performing arts business – until the pandemic came along and rewrote the script. Like many, I had to adapt. That experience made me even more determined to stand up for local people, especially when times are tough.\nOne of the most eye-opening and humbling roles I’ve had was working at Nightsafe, a homelessness charity in Blackburn. Supporting young people in crisis, many with nowhere else to turn, gave me a deeper understanding of just how vital safe housing and support services are. It wasn’t always easy – in fact, it was often heartbreaking – but it taught me the importance of listening without judgement and fighting for those who’ve been left behind. That experience still shapes the way I approach politics and public service today.\nCloser to home, I’m a proud co-founder and Trustee of Longridge Community Action (LCA). What began as a creative project to bring a bit more colour and community spirit to Longridge has grown into something with real reach. In the past, we’ve successfully secured funding to keep the youth club open more often – something very close to my heart – and helped establish a Longridge Youth Council, giving young people a platform to be heard. We've also supported the launch of Longridge Men’s Shed, providing a safe and social space for men to meet, share skills, and look out for one another. At its heart, LCA is about building community – through creativity, collaboration, and care.\nI also know what it’s like to stand up when it would be easier to stay quiet. During a particularly tough time at work, I stepped up to become a union rep – not because it was convenient, but because it was the right thing to do. I stood by my colleagues, made our case, and helped make sure people were treated fairly. It was a proper little saga, but it reminded me that when people stick together and fight for what's right, they can make a real difference.\nThese days, I work for a Member of Parliament, where I’ve gained valuable insight into how decisions are made and how to fight for the people they affect. I also serve as a Longridge Town Councillor and a Borough Councillor for the Derby and Thornley ward in Longridge, where I’ve built a track record of getting things done – from chasing up pothole repairs to supporting residents through tricky council processes.\nMy focus is always on practical, people-first politics. I believe in rolling up my sleeves (sometimes literally), listening to what matters to residents, and doing the graft – no empty promises, just real work for our communities.\nA Familiar Face, A Local Voice\nWhen I’m not out knocking on doors or in council meetings, you’ll probably find me roaming the fells of the Trough of Bowland – usually getting lost but enjoying every minute of it. I also probably spend too much time in pubs, but in my defence, it’s hard not to when (in my opinion) Longridge with Bowland has some of the best pubs in the country. Add in a good pub quiz, a walk with friends, or a brew in one of our brilliant local cafés, and you’ve pretty much got my ideal weekend.\nWhat drives me is simple: I care about where we live. I know how amazing our towns, villages and countryside are, and I believe local government should work for everyone, not just a few. Whether it’s fighting for better roads, protecting services, or backing support for children with SEND, I’ll always put our area first.\nIf you're looking for a County Councillor who’s local, approachable, and not afraid to roll their sleeves up, I’m your person. And if I ever take myself too seriously – don’t worry, there’s usually someone nearby to remind me where I came from.",
