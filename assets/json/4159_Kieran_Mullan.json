It meets at 10.00am every Tuesday and is open to any local resident. Residents can enjoy the free community café and for £3 they can visit the community larder. The larder stocks a wide range of fresh fruit and vegetables along with store cupboard items, some of which would otherwise go to waste. The Marketplace has between 50-60 people attend each week.\nThe Marketplace café has become incredibly popular with local residents. It has helped alleviate loneliness in the community for all generations - from parents with young children to senior citizens. It is a welcoming place to meet, chat and make friends.\nFor those experiencing food poverty, sometimes as a result of debt, the CAP team are on hand to help with face-to-face budget and debt management advice. CAP can also take proactive steps with debtors to solve worrying financial problems. In addition, to CAP, the Citizens Advice Bureau (CAB), Warm Homes advisers, Bexhill Foodbank and local Healthwatch are regular visitors to the Marketplace providing information and support to local residents.\nKieran commented: “I really enjoyed my visit to the Marketplace at Freedom Church. It is a great example of a voluntary community initiative which has achieved far more than its original goals of reducing food waste and helping those experiencing food poverty. It has become central to the community in Sidley and serves a really important role in supporting residents by also helping to alleviate loneliness, provide a place to meet and connect with other services for advice and support. I was pleased to speak to one local resident who told me how her life has changed for the better since coming along to the Marketplace and receiving debt advice support from CAP. I am really grateful to the team of over 20 volunteers who help to make this such a vibrant and supportive community initiative.\nFor more information about The Marketplace visit www.freedomchurchbexhill.com/the-marketplace/ or telephone 01424 223217.

MPs place a cross in the garden to honour and remember all of those from our constituencies who have served given so much to protect the freedoms we are privileged to enjoy today. We do this on behalf of our constituents and it is always a thoughtful and poignant moment. I was honoured to place a cross for all those from the Bexhill and Battle constituency and reflect on the enormous sacrifice and bravery of these men and women.\nOn Friday evening I was delighted to be invited to a concert by the local Royal British Legion Concert Band of Bexhill and Little Common which took place at the Comrades Club in London Road, Bexhill. It was a fantastic evening raising money for the Royal British Legion and I’d like to thank everyone who got involved. Saturday afternoon saw me out in Bexhill selling poppies with Cllr Ian Hollidge. It was good to meet so many people buying poppies for themselves and their dogs!\nOn Sunday, it was a great privilege to take part in the Bexhill Remembrance Day proceedings and to lay a wreath on behalf of all my constituents. I wrote on mine \"Our labours are as nothing to yours. Thank you.\" I wrote this as Remembrance causes me to think about the enormous hardship and sacrifice endured by so many to give us the future we all enjoy and can help to give perspective to us for our challenges. I try to imagine what it must have been like – perhaps for a young man, maybe 20 – crossing the channel to take part in D-Day or fighting in the trenches in WWI. Their incredible bravery but almost certainly great fear as well. Seeing friends killed right beside them. Sorely missing loved ones and the comfort of home. Their families missing them and worrying about them in return. The dreaded news received by mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters when their relative was killed. That is what we must never forget. It is always heartening to see so many young people taking part so that their sacrifice is remembered in future. Thank you to all of those involved in organising the day which ran very smoothly and enabled lots of people to take part and witness.\nFinally, on my way into Westminster on Monday morning, I walked passed the Cenotaph on Whitehall. This is Britain’s chief national war memorial for those who lost their lives serving during the First and Second World War, as well as all subsequent conflicts. I was moved by what an incredible sight it is. Our nation can be proud of our history and those who helped make it.\nPhoto: Kieran at Parliament’s Garden of Remembrance",

Instead, the site would be sold.\nKieran Mullan said “I know residents will join me in welcoming the government’s decision not to proceed with an immigration accommodation site at Northeye in Bexhill.\nI want to thank campaigners, and cross-party councillors across all layers of local government for fighting against this plan. I’ve done all I can to support them. I am especially pleased for the residents of the Northeye Estate for whom the uncertainty and worry is over.”",

These included business rates, traffic congestion and HGVs along the high street, car parking charges, public toilets and shop-lifting. Kieran offered to support the Chamber members raise these issues with appropriate bodies and to champion their campaigns.\nKieran Mullan MP said “It was really good to meet with so many business owners at the Battle Chamber breakfast to hear firsthand about the issues which affect them. Small businesses are vital to towns like Battle by providing employment opportunities, economic growth and ensuring our high streets remain an important focal point for the community. I know that issues like parking, traffic congestion, business rates and crime affect their ability to grow and thrive which is why I am keen to support them in their bid to ensure Battle remains a thriving town in which to live and work as well as an attractive place to visit.”\nDarren Buss, President of Battle Chamber of Commerce said \"We thank Kieran for joining us for a constructive meeting. Businesses in Battle are facing a number of issues that are having an impact on footfall in the town and it is so important to have these open discussions. Our goal as a chamber is to improve our wonderful high street, support our excellent businesses, and create a better community for Battle and surrounding areas.

The news will be incredibly disappointing for many, especially considering the over 4,000 people who signed the petition to save it. I would like to thank everyone who signed it, and my thoughts are with those staff members of the current branch who must be having a tough time adjusting to the news.\nMy next steps are to secure a number of commitments from the Post Office to ensure that the replacement franchise branch will be in a convenient location, with the same services and no interruption of operation. I want to make sure that, no matter what happens, Bexhill always has a post office like Devonshire Square.\nIn non constituency only news I'm pleased to say that the Solicitor General has agreed to my request to refer the sentence of triple murderer Nicholas Prosper to the Court of Appeal after he was not given a whole life order. This was a horrific crime and it is deserving of the most severe penalty a court can give.\nOn to my visits!\nI had the opportunity to visit the British Gypsum Mine in Robertsbridge, a really important local employer who provides skilled jobs and adds to the variety of careers available in our area. Many of the people I spoke with started their careers there and it is clear there are still job real opportunities.\nLast week, I spoke with the Colonnade traders about their concerns for the future of their businesses when the Colonnade is closed for repairs and refurbishment. They are understandably worried about where they would locate whilst repairs are being done and the uncertainties over them being able to return. But I have received assurance that they now have a direct line of communication to a senior officer at the Council who will keep them updated as plans progress.\nI met with a number of Rother town and parish clerks, who work really hard to support their councillors across the district, to discuss planning enforcement and local development, as well as opportunities which may come about through devolution and local government reorganisation. We are going to explore these opportunities further and look at examples from abroad, and elsewhere in the country, to look at best practice.\nMy meeting with Sussex Police, National Highways, East Sussex County Council, local councillors and community reps from Hooe, to talk about road safety on the A259, comes following a number of serious accidents late last year, including a tragic fatality. I'm pleased that National Highways will now be carrying out a full route study of the A259 and A27 in East Sussex to look at safety, traffic levels and how the road is being used.\nRecently, I met with Henry Kicinski-Mason, Member of Sussex Youth Parliament and East Sussex Youth Cabinet. He explained the work he conducts to gather the views of young people, and how he then communicates them back to local stakeholders and partners. He can be proud of the work he has done to relay young people’s views to local decision-makers.\nThis week, I visited Eastbourne District General Hospital to hear more about their plans to use geothermal energy to help heat the hospital in a greener way. Whilst not in my constituency is provides care to lots of my constituents. Geothermal energy is heat that comes from deep underground, and across the country 109 NHS hospitals in England and Wales overlie potential geothermal aquifers! I’ll keep working with the NHS and the government to help support practical, ready-to-go projects like this one.\nI was a pleased to visit the Sara Lee Therapy Centre in Sidley, where I met with charity CEO, Dan Redsull, and Operations Manager, Jayne Thomas. This local charity provides invaluable free counselling and alternative therapy for those diagnosed with cancer, or other life-threatening illness, and their families. I look forward to working with Sara Lee charity and supporting them as they continue to offer vital support services to the people of Bexhill, Hastings and Rother.\nI had the pleasure of visiting The Marketplace at Freedom Church in Sidley to find out more about the community larder, café and debt advice services. With 20+ volunteers who give their time and energy each week to keep The Marketplace running, they have helped to create a vibrant and supportive community initiative. Check out my article for more information.\nI visited Etchingham’s Newt Conservation Project, who work to carry out a government-approved approach to conservation of great crested newts. I know some people have shared my frustration at the way we manage protecting species, so it was great to learn more about alternative approaches to protecting newt populations where developers can contribute to schemes in the area run by experts that make a big impact on biodiversity.\nIt was a great honour to treat Bexhill resident and Royal British Legion volunteer, Mrs Winifred Warner to tea and cake! Winifred has recently been awarded a badge by the RBL for 30 years of volunteering service. Now in her 90th year, she has no intention of retiring from her volunteering – a remarkable lady!\n11th April marked World Parkinson’s Day. Parkinson’s UK provides a range of support for individuals and families affected by Parkinson's, from offering a listening ear to specialist guidance on care and employment. As your local MP, I'm also available to offer support to my constituents, so please do contact my office if you need assistance.\nAnd lastly, please see the bottom of this week’s newsletter for information on local road closures, as provided by third parties.\nHave a great weekend.\nThis week's newsletter:\n- Future of Bexhill Post Office\n- Review of Nicholas Prosper's Sentence\n- Visit to British Gypsum Mine in Robertsbridge\n- Meeting with The Colonnade Traders\n- Rother Parish Clerks Meeting\n- A259 Road Safety Meeting\n- Meeting with Member of Youth Parliament & Youth Cabinet\n- Eastbourne Hospital Geothermal Energy On-site Meeting\n- Visit to The Sara Lee Trust Therapy Centre\n- Market Place at Freedom Church\n- Etchingham Newt Conservation Partnership\n- Meeting with RBL Volunteer Mrs Winifred Warner\n- World Parkinson's Day\n- Local Road Closures\nFuture of Bexhill Post Office\nLast week, unfortunately we learnt that the Post Office has decided to proceed with the closure of all their directly managed branches (DMBs). This news is incredibly disappointing for many, especially considering over 4,000 people signed the petition to save the branch. I’m also mindful of the Devonshire Square branch staff, who must be having a tough time adjusting to the news.\nDuring a Ministerial Statement following the announced closure of the last remaining DMBs, I asked the Minister for guarantees that the replacement branch would provide the same services and requested that he veto the closure if this guarantee wasn't met.\nThe Minister confirmed that he would expect there to be all the same services. This means that customers should still be able to use all the same services that they had before at Devonshire Square. However, he could not provide a guarantee to veto the closure if we didn't get those same services. So I will continue to push for this.\nThough Post Office have committed to delivering a franchise service in the town, we don’t yet have the guarantees we would need to know we aren’t going to be worse off as a result.\nFirstly, the location of the new franchised branch – Post Office’s access criteria states the replacement should be within a 1-mile radius of the current branch. I’ve requested it be within a ½ mile to make sure it remains within Bexhill town, but I’ve not received absolute confirmation of this yet.\nSecondly, cash deposits – I’ve insisted that current cash deposit services continue, particularly for local businesses and charities that need to deposit large amounts of coins. No guarantees have been made on this yet.\nLastly, no interruption of service – I was assured that a franchisee would be operational when the DMB closes, but I haven’t received clear information on the viability of franchisee applications. Without this, I can’t yet have full confidence in the continuity of service.\nI’m also currently working to secure a commitment that if a new franchise were to fail, the Post Office would provide a temporary branch so Bexhill wouldn’t be left without service. I want to make sure that, no matter what happens, Bexhill always has a post office like Devonshire Square.\nThank you again to everyone who signed the petition. We’ll continue fighting for what’s best for Bexhill and its residents, and hold the Post Office accountable. I expect there will be a future consultation about Bexhill specifically.\nAlso check out the video below of me speaking about all of this on BBC Sussex.\nReview of Nicholas Prosper's Sentence\nI'm glad that the Government is taking forward my referral of the sentence for murderer Nicholas Prosper. These were the most heinous crimes deserving of the most severe penalty a court can give.\nProsper murdered his mother Juliana Falcon, and his siblings Giselle (13) and Kyle (16), in a brutal attack in their family home. Despite this, the judge declined to impose a whole life order — meaning Prosper could one day be released.\nFollowing widespread concern, I wrote to the Attorney General asking for the sentence to be reviewed under the Unduly Lenient Sentence Scheme. The Solicitor General has now confirmed that the case is being referred.\nThis was a horrific crime. The original sentence failed to reflect its seriousness and left many people rightly outraged.\nThere’s a clear gap between what most law-abiding people consider justice and what is too often delivered in court. The idea that someone who commits an act like this could eventually walk free is incomprehensible to many.\nThe Court of Appeal now has the opportunity to put this right. The victims — and the public — deserve nothing less.\nRead more about this story in the link below: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c1759wxkg5go\nVisit to British Gypsum Mine in Robertsbridge\nI had the opportunity to visit the British Gypsum Mine in Robertsbridge – a really important local employer providing skilled jobs and adding real variety to the kinds of careers available in our area.\nThe construction industry is still a great choice for people starting out or looking for something new, and it was brilliant to see the range of roles on offer at the site. I spoke to several team members who began their careers here and are still going strong years later – it’s clear there are real opportunities to grow and progress.\nAnd not many people can say they’ve been down a mine deep underground!\nThanks so much for having me!\nIf you'd like to read more details, check out my Sussex World article here.\nMeeting with The Colonnade Traders\nLast Friday, I met with the Colonnade traders to talk about their concerns for the future of their businesses when the Colonnade is closed for repairs and refurbishment.\nThey have worked hard to make success of their micro businesses at the Colonnade, some having been there for many years with a loyal customer base. They are understandably worried about where they would locate whilst repairs are being done and there are uncertainties over them being able to return, which makes it hard for them to plan for the longer-term.\nI understand the challenges that Rother District Council faces in ensuring that council-owned assets provide best value for money for the taxpayer. However, the traders really need more certainty about the future so they can plan ahead.\nWhilst, at this stage, Rother has advised that no long-term commitments can be given, I have supported the traders request that they maintain clear and direct dialogue with them which will allow the traders to make decisions about their businesses at the earliest possible opportunity.\nI have received assurance that they now have a direct line of communication to a senior officer at the Council who will keep them updated as plans progress.\nRother Parish Clerks Meeting\nI met with a number of Rother town and parish clerks who work really hard to support their councillors across the district.\nWe met at The Almonry in Battle where we discussed issues of concern, with planning enforcement and local development being key issues for many of them. We also talked about the opportunities which may come about through devolution, and local government reorganisation, to take on and manage more local assets and services for the local community.\nWe are going to explore these opportunities further and look at examples from abroad and elsewhere in the country to look at best practice.\nA259 Road Safety Meeting\nLast week, I met with Sussex Police, National Highways, East Sussex County Council, local councillors and community reps from Hooe to talk about road safety on the A259.\nThis followed a number of serious accidents late last year, including a tragic fatality. I wanted to get everyone round the table to understand what’s been happening and what more can be done.\nPolice and National Highways shared data showing that, overall, the road isn't classed as high risk but that doesn’t reflect the real concerns I’ve heard from residents, especially those in Hooe and surrounding villages, who deal with the impact of accidents and road closures far too often.\nI'm pleased that National Highways will now be carrying out a full route study of the A259 and A27 in East Sussex to look at safety, traffic levels and how the road is being used. This is the first step to securing investment and changes, as we've seen happen on the A21.\nI’ll be keeping in touch with the team leading the study and will back any bids for funding to make the road safer.\nEast Sussex has long been overlooked when it comes to transport. If we’re being asked to take more housing, we need the infrastructure to match — that means safer, more resilient roads like the A259.\nIf you'd like to read more details, check out my Sussex World article here.\nMeeting with Member of Youth Parliament & Youth Cabinet\nI was pleased to meet with Henry Kicinski-Mason, Member of Sussex Youth Parliament and East Sussex Youth Cabinet.\nHenry explained how he conducts surveys, creative consultations, and workshops to gather the views of young people, before taking time to clearly communicate these back to local stakeholders and partners. This makes sure that young people are represented in the changes made locally.\nIt was a great chance to hear directly from a representative of young people about the local issues that matter to them. Henry can be proud of the work he has done to ask young people what their views are, and for taking the time to communicate them to local decision-makers.\nI’ve agreed to ask Bexhill Town Board if they too will meet with him to hear more.\nEastbourne Hospital Geothermal Energy On-site Meeting\nThis week, I visited Eastbourne District General Hospital to hear more about their plans to use geothermal energy to help heat the hospital in a greener way. It is one of the main hospitals serving the constituency even though it is located across the boundary.\nGeothermal energy is heat that comes from deep underground. In parts of East Sussex, there are layers of warm water and rock under the surface—called hot sedimentary aquifers—that can be used to heat buildings without using gas or oil.\nI’ve been a strong supporter of geothermal energy for some time. It’s a clean, reliable source of heat that’s been underused in the UK for too long. One way to help it grow is to group projects together so investors feel more confident.\nStarting with hospitals makes sense—they use a lot of heat and the NHS has its own decarbonisation targets.\nAcross the country, of 210 NHS hospitals in England and Wales that have been prioritised for decarbonisation due to their high heat demand, 109 hospitals overlie potential geothermal aquifers. If we can get projects like this off the ground, it will be good for the environment, help the NHS cut energy costs, and show that geothermal is a safe, smart investment.\nI’ll keep working with the NHS and the government to help support practical, ready-to-go projects like this one.\nVisit to The Sara Lee Trust Therapy Centre\nI was pleased to visit the Sara Lee Therapy Centre in Sidley this week where I met with charity CEO, Dan Redsull, and Operations Manager, Jayne Thomas.\nThis local charity provides invaluable free counselling and alternative therapy for those diagnosed with cancer, or other life-threatening illness, and their families. Their bespoke services can take place at the therapy centre or at home, depending on need. Patients are referred to Sara Lee via health professionals.\nI was given a tour of the therapy centre which has space for group therapies, individual therapy rooms and counselling rooms. The charity has created a lovely calming environment where they provide support and care to local residents during very difficult times.\nWhilst there, I met with two of their therapists who told me how much they love their work because they experience firsthand the difference they make to people's lives through their therapy, care and support.\nI look forward to working with Sara Lee charity and supporting them as they continue to offer vital support services to the people of Bexhill, Hastings and Rother.\nMarketplace at Freedom Church\nI had the pleasure of visiting The Marketplace at Freedom Church in Sidley to find out more about the community larder, café and debt advice services which operate from the church at Claremont Road in Sidley.\nI met with Maureen Chaseley, who co-ordinates the project, Freedom Church Pastor Sally Sago, and Revd Guy Partridge who is manager of Bexhill Christians Against Poverty (CAP) and leads the debt advice service.\nThe Marketplace meets from 10.00am -12.00pm every Tuesday and is open to any local resident. For £3.00, residents can enjoy the community café and, if they would like, have a visit to the community larder. The larder stocks a wide range of fresh fruit and vegetables along with store cupboard items, some of which would otherwise go to waste. The Marketplace has between 50-60 people attend each week.\nThe Marketplace café has become incredibly popular with local residents. It has helped alleviate loneliness in the community for all generations - from parents with young children to senior citizens. It is a welcoming place to meet, chat and make friends.\nFor those experiencing food poverty, sometimes as a result of debt, the CAP team are on hand to help with face-to-face budget and debt management advice. CAP can also take proactive steps with debtors to solve worrying financial problems. In addition, to CAP, the Citizens Advice Bureau (CAB), Warm Homes advisers, Bexhill Foodbank and local Healthwatch are regular visitors to the Marketplace providing information and support to local residents.\nI’m so grateful to the 20+ volunteers who give their time and energy each week to keep The Marketplace running and have helped to make such a vibrant and supportive community initiative.\nYou can find out more at www.freedomchurchbexhill.com/the-marketplace\nEtchingham Newt Conservation Partnership\nThis week, I visited Etchingham’s Newt Conservation Partnership, who work with NatureSpace to carry out a government-approved approach to the conservation of great crested newts.\nI know some people have shared my frustrations that the way we manage protecting species like newts when building is illogical at times. It can be a tick box for developers without much public benefit and certainly not always the best way of spending money to benefit wildlife.\nGiven this, it was great to learn more about alternative approaches to protecting newt populations, where instead of doing it directly themselves, developers can contribute to schemes in the area run by experts that make a big impact on biodiversity.\nThe Newt Conservation Partnership, with sites across the UK, works with landowners to deliver wildlife-friendly ponds for great crested newts, creating hundreds of lakes and boasts of having double the number of newts per pond compared with standard bodies of waters.\nI will be interested to keep in touch to hear more about the progress of their work.\nMeeting with RBL Volunteer Mrs Winifred Warner\nIt was a great honour to meet Bexhill resident and Royal British Legion volunteer, Mrs Winifred Warner who has recently been awarded a badge by the RBL for 30 years of volunteering service. It was my pleasure to treat her to tea and cake as a thank you!\nMany local people will recognise Win who knits poppies to help with RBL fund-raising and joins other volunteers every year outside of Tesco supermarket in Ravenside for the Poppy Appeal collection. Now in her 90th year, she has no intention of retiring from her volunteering. She is a remarkable lady.\nThanks to the Crafty Norman Brasserie for making us so welcome and for the delicious cake selection.\nWorld Parkinson's Day\n11th April marked #WorldParkinsonsDay. Parkinson's UK provides a range of support for individuals and families affected by Parkinson's, from offering a listening ear to specialist guidance on care and employment.\nYou can find out more about their local resources at www.parkinsons.org.uk or by calling their helpline on 0808 800 0303.\nAs your local MP, I am also available to offer support to my constituents.

He argued that people who make the wrong choices which harm our community should be punished appropriately.\nIn both appearances Kieran drew attention to a recent case reported in the media where two convicted Class A Drug Dealers have been spared jail, after they cited low wages and being unemployed as mitigating circumstances in their defence.\nAs Shadow Justice minister Dr Mullan highlighted that he thought it right to refer this specific case to the ‘Unduly lenient sentence scheme’. This is a mechanism whereby sentences that are thought to be too lenient are referred to the Attorney General, who makes a judgment as to whether the sentence ought to be reviewed.\nIn the two interviews he placed an emphasis on the fact that we cannot keep making excuses for the choices people make. The vast majority of people across the country, like those in the constituency of Bexhill and Battle, make the right choices everyday regardless of their financial circumstances and do not turn to crime.\nWhilst recognising that some people face ‘challenging circumstances’ Kieran stressed this case involved ‘serious offences’ and that we must ensure people are ‘properly punished’ by the Justice system.\nDr Mullan stressed that the justice system exists to work on our behalf, and that it is important the public see justice is done.\nDr Kieran Mullan, Member of Parliament for Bexhill and Battle, said:\n- “we can’t make excuses for people when it comes to the choices they make, because that is insulting to everybody who makes better choices”\n- “the justice system is there on our behalf … so that when we’re the victims of crime, we feel justice is done”\n- “What has to come first is the message we send to the vast law abiding majority, the incentives we give for people to make the right choices and ensuring people are properly punished by our justice system’.\nWatch Kieran's appearances on GB news and Good Morning Britain below:",
  "https_www_drkieranmullan_org_uk_/https_www_drkieranmullan_org_uk_rosebank-oil-field/content_67.html": "Thank you for contacting me about the Rosebank oil field.\nI am pleased that the Government has committed to not bringing to an end any of the oil licenses that are currently in place, including Rosebank.\nHowever, I am concerned that the Government's decision not to fight a legal challenge against the decision to grant consent to drill in the oil and gas fields of Shetland and Aberdeen, may create more delay and additional costs.\nI am aware that in September 2023, the North Sea Transition Authority (NSTA) granted development and production consent for the Rosebank field, north-west of Shetland. I am informed that the decision to approve the Rosebank development follows extensive scrutiny by regulators, including a full environmental impact assessment and a public consultation.\nDevelopments such as Rosebank will help strengthen the UK’s energy security and support the transition to net zero. I understand that Rosebank is expected to be significantly less emissions-intensive than previous developments, which will help the UK to reach its ambitious targets for net zero. Its operator, Equinor, estimates that the amount of carbon dioxide from oil produced onshore will be around 60 per cent of the level of oil produced offshore. The more energy options we have available to us, the less the costs of fighting climate change are passed on to the tax-payer.\nFurther, the Rosebank project will also help create new jobs and opportunities. I understand from its operator that Rosebank will provide £6.3 billion of investment in UK-based businesses, support around 400 UK-based jobs, and add around £24 billion to the UK economy across the project’s lifetime.\nWe have to recognise that further action from us at potentially great short term cost will only take us so far. The current and future major contributors to CO2 emissions (which cause these extreme weather events) are countries like America, China and India, with China planning to open two new coal power plants each week and their emissions expected to peak in 2030. This is where the focus needs to be.\nThank you again for taking the time to contact me.",

Its where I feel most at home.\nBexhill, Battle and the many villages that make up the constituency all have their own challenges and needs. It is my job to work all year round on those. Here are just some of the issues that residents talk to me about that are important to them:\nCLEANING UP OUR WATER\nThe government has brought in new unlimited fines and the tightest ever monitoring of discharges into our rivers and sea front. It is my job to relentlessly push the water companies to clean up their mess-no excuses.\nSUPPORTING OUR FARMERS AND PROTECTING OUR COUNTRYSIDE\nMy Dad's family were farmers & growing up we were lucky enough to have a small holding so I spent most of my weekends in the countryside. Farmers put food on our tables & are stewards of our lands. I have campaigned for new laws to protect livestock from dog attacks & will oppose solar farms on prime farmland.\nOPPOSING THE PLANS FOR THE NORTHEYE ASYLUM DETENTION CENTRE\nI will always be willing to stand up for my constituents if the government gets things wrong. The plans for Northeye are not the right ones for Bexhill and I will do my best to get the Home Office to reconsider. You don't win on every issue but that doesn't mean you shouldn't try.\nSECURING INVESTMENT IN OUR LOCAL HOSPITALS\nI spent more than 10 years working on the frontline of the NHS as a doctor in A&E before entering politics. I wanted to use my experience to improve the NHS for all of us. Labour will freeze plans to invest in our local hospitals. I want to drive forward that investment so our staff are working in first class facilities.\nBACKING OUR HIGH STREETS & BUSINESSES\nI have spent time speaking to retailers about how I can better support our high streets in Bexhill, Battle and the villages. We need to back our police when they take a zero tolerance approach to shoplifting. We also need to make use of new laws to get absent landlords to work with us to fill vacant spaces.\nFIGHTING ON LOCAL ISSUES THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO YOU\nEach town and village will have local issues that are important to them. Whether it is speeding through our rural villages, houses being built in the wrong places, potholes on our roads or getting more public toilets opened in Bexhill - you tell me what is important to you and I will do my best to help.\nBut I want to hear your priorities. Complete my residents survey online and tell me what you think!\nI look forward to speaking to as many of you as possible over the coming weeks of the campaign!",

Commenting Kieran said:\n“I am firmly opposed to the closure of Bexhill Post Office. I know that it’s loss would have a big impact on the town, its residents and businesses. It would not just impact Bexhill residents, but also those from nearby rural local areas who cannot get the more specialised Post Office services such as passport checking and DVLA licences from the smaller branches. The staff of the Bexhill Post Office have years of extensive experience and good relationships with their regular customers. They are highly respected and valued and have made sure that Devonshire Square Post Office is an integral and important part of the Bexhill community. In their manifesto Labour said it would strengthen our Post Office network, not weaken it.”\n“Bexhill residents have seen four major banks leave their high streets in the last couple of years. They were promised by those banks that their day-to-day banking needs would be met by their local Post Office. They will now feel that they have been sold a lie if the main Post Office also leaves the high street. I will be asking the Post Office and the Government to reconsider this proposal and I urge residents to support me by signing the petition to Save Bexhill Post Office on my website.”\nTo support the campaign to Save Bexhill Post Office visit https://www.drkieranmullan.org.uk/campaigns/save-bexhill-post-office",
  "https_www_drkieranmullan_org_uk_/https_www_drkieranmullan_org_uk_news_tackling-challenges-local-business-top-priority/content_58.html": "I’ve had a busy couple of weeks in the constituency during the Parliamentary conference recess. My meetings and visits have included schools, farms, County Council, Rother District Council, Environment Agency, homeless support groups, village groups, Sussex Police and local business. I’m very grateful to everyone who has given their time to update me on important local issues and highlight the great work that goes on across so many communities.\nLast Friday, I got to meet members of the Bexhill Chamber of Commerce over a business breakfast. Micro, small and medium sized (SMEs) businesses are the keystone of the British economy. At the start of 2023 there were 5.6 million small businesses in the UK (with 0 to 49 employees), 99.2% of the total business population. In East Sussex there were around 23,000 enterprises - 90% of which employ nine people or fewer. Given the importance of SMEs to our local economy and employment, it’s important that I am well-connected to the local business community and work to support them.\nDuring the business breakfast, I heard about some of the challenges our local high street businesses face, including shop-lifting and the challenges of parking in Bexhill. On parking, business owners do not think that the County Council have got the controlled parking areas right. I am told that too many town centre streets in Bexhill are empty of cars all day as too many spaces have been designated ‘resident permit’ only. I will be speaking to our local county councillors for Bexhill to see how this can be addressed.\nShop-lifting is a real concern and I want to see a crackdown on individuals who think they can walk into our local shops and steal with impunity. It is not a petty or victimless crime - the victims are small business owners who lose revenue, their staff who face abuse, threats and sometimes violence, and shoppers who are intimidated and shocked by these brazen thieves. This crime may be considered fairly low-level when it comes to court sentencing but for many who are involved, it’s the start of a life of more serious crime. The day before the Chamber breakfast, I had met with the Hastings and Rother District Commander for Sussex Police. We discussed the police response to reports of shop-lifting and the penalties for repeat offenders. They have agreed to work with me to encourage local shop keepers to report shoplifters and to ensure every opportunity to prosecute is taken. I know some people have given up on the assumption nothing will be done and I want to turn that around.\nMany shop-lifters are repeat offenders so I am pleased to hear that facial recognition technology for shops is about to be rolled out in Bexhill thanks to Levelling Up Partnership funding. This technology, known as DISC, has been successful in Hastings by alerting shop-owners to known criminals entering their stores and this information is shared across town businesses. Even with this in place, it is really important that every incident of shop-lifting is reported to the police. For repeat offenders, the more evidence gathered the better the chances of a conviction and stronger sentencing and, ultimately, getting these criminals off our streets and neighbourhoods.",

Under the original programme, Eastbourne was set to be entirely rebuilt, Conquest Hospital reorganised and modernised, and Bexhill upgraded to offer expanded local services. These plans included increasing inpatient beds by 13%, single patient rooms as a proportion of hospital space from 18% to 70%, and outpatient consulting rooms by 28%.\nThese improvements were originally due to be delivered by 2030 but, following the Labour Government's review into the New Hospital Programme, the work is now expected to be completed by 2039 at the earliest.\n“Having worked as a doctor in A&E, I’ve seen first hand how outdated facilities place additional strain on our healthcare staff,” Dr Mullan stated. “While our frontline workers go above and beyond, we owe it to them to deliver the modern infrastructure they need.”\nHe noted that East Sussex Healthcare Trust faces a critical infrastructure risk of £64 million, part of an overall £300 million backlog in repairs. Without urgent investment, the total cost of repairs is expected to rise to £460 million within a decade. “Delays only escalate construction costs and strain our healthcare system. Investment now will save money—and lives—in the long term,” he warned.\nDr Mullan called on the government to provide interim funding to address urgent maintenance needs and ensure East Sussex hospitals can continue to deliver safe, effective care. He emphasised the importance of modernising hospital layouts to reflect 21st-century healthcare needs, improve digital capabilities, and support an aging population.\n“This decision to delay vital hospital upgrades risks undermining patient care, staff morale, and public trust,” he concluded. “Delay must not mean deterioration. The government must act now to protect both patients and NHS staff.”",

I assure you that I back small businesses, including responsible short-term holiday letting, which I recognise brings significant investment to local communities. At the same time, it is important to acknowledge the impact that large numbers of holiday lets concentrated in an area can have on local communities. There are many locations in the UK where local people are simply priced out of living in the areas they are from, such as in parts of Cornwall and Norfolk.\nThe Government has published draft legislation to abolish the furnished holiday lettings tax regime from April 2025. As I understand it, the intention is to align the tax rules for furnished holiday lettings with those for other property businesses.\nMy personal preference would be for a regime based on geography, potentially at local council level, so that problem areas can make use of this change but that it doesn’t cause unintended consequences elsewhere.\nThank you again for taking the time to contact me.\nKind regards,\nKieran",

It is one of the most photographed castles in England dating from 1385 and the top visitor attraction for the Bexhill and Battle constituency in 2023.\nKieran was given a tour of the castle by Karen Stafford, General Manager, and Beatrice Rapley, Visitor Experience and Programme Manager. Both Karen and Beatrice manage Bodiam Castle and Bateman’s House and Garden in Burwash. These local National Trust properties are key visitor attractions for East Sussex and play an important role in the local visitor economy. Bodiam attracted over 150,000 visitors in 2023/24 and Bateman’s over 120,000.\nDuring the tour of the castle, Kieran learned about the history of the castle and was shown some highlights including the original portcullis gates, ancient graffiti marks, climbed the towers for amazing views across the Rother valley and found out about the significance of the castle bats – the site is home to one of the most important bat roosts in the UK. He also heard about the extensive programme of visitor events coming up this year, including a special ‘How to Train Your Dragon’ May half-term activity which will coincide with the release of the film based on the best-selling children’s novels later this year.\nSpeaking after the visit, Kieran said “I really enjoyed my visit to Bodiam Castle. Not only is it a great place to explore with lots of activities and special events running throughout the year, it also has the most amazing views of the local landscapes. We are very lucky to have two National Trust properties in the Bexhill and Battle constituency alongside two historically significant English Heritage properties at Battle Abbey and Pevensey Castle. As well as these historic buildings there is so much for local residents and visitors to enjoy including vineyards, craft breweries, picturesque towns and villages, glamping and camping sites and many pubs and restaurants offering local food and great hospitality.\n“Tourism is a very significant part of our local economy. Hospitality and tourism-related businesses in East Sussex support thousands of jobs. Recent data from Visit Britian showed that the visitor economy spend in East Sussex was £287M in 2022. I am therefore keen to support all our local visitor destinations and businesses and encourage both residents and visitors to enjoy and discover all that the beautiful Bexhill and Battle constituency has to offer.”",

The Minister didn’t seem to know the answer, agreeing to write to Dr Mullan.\nThe question was the following: \"In Bexhill and Battle we get to enjoy the amazing High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. But it's expansive, covering more than 1400 square kilometres. What specific advice did his department give to the housing department when it comes to taking things like that into account? When we have centrally imposed housing targets putting pressure on the area as a whole?”\nWatch his intervention below:\nDr Mullan commented after:\n“Something has to give. We will either see house building in protected spaces or completely unrealistic targets for the non-protected parts of our rural communities. They have to review their formula to take into account parts of the country with large areas of protected land. They have lowered the targets for big cities like London because they are saying they aren’t realistic. These new targets aren’t realistic for our area.\"\nHis question follows the unveiling of new planning rules by Angela Rayner MP in July, which requires Rother District Council to almost triple the number of homes being built each year. With 83% of the land in the area designated as AONB, Dr Mullan argues that these targets are unrealistic and risks developers running wild when they aren’t met.",

He also had the opportunity to try his hand at bowls, much to the amusement of the members.\nKieran also met with Club Chairman, Denis, to discuss the club’s ambitious plans to install a state-of-the-art solar energy system. With rising utility costs and an ageing building, the installation of a solar grid would significantly reduce expenses while also contributing to a cleaner, more sustainable energy supply. The club hopes that surplus energy could also benefit surrounding businesses.\nCommenting on the visit, Kieran said:\n\"Egerton Park Bowls Club is a fantastic community asset, providing opportunities for people to stay active and socially connected. Their plans for a new solar grid are both forward-thinking and necessary, helping to secure the club’s future while also promoting sustainability.

He was also keen to know how well these post-EU farm subsidies are supporting farmers in food production to support UK food security. Currently, 62% of the food consumed in the UK is produced here.\nThe NFU and farmers were clear about the challenges they face in balancing environmental management with food production. They felt it was important to make sure that incentives to use land for renewable energy projects like solar and windfarms along with environmental and biodiversity schemes do not outweigh the incentive to produce food.\nFollowing the meeting Kieran commented:\n“It was really good to meet local farmers to hear about the challenges and opportunities they face. They are as passionate about food production as they are about ensuring biodiversity and careful land management. I want to work with local farmers and the NFU to ensure that the UK’s farm subsidy schemes work for their businesses and that the focus of farming remains about producing home grown food and providing UK food security.”\nNFU County Adviser for East Sussex and West Sussex Romy Gue said:\n“It was great to meet with MP Kieran Mullan and for our members to discuss some of the key farming challenges they are dealing with. He was interested and engaged, and we look forward to working with him further in the future.\nThe NFU is keen to engage with MPs from all political parties to work towards a brighter future for farming.\n“British farmers are the chief deliverers of future nature recovery. They take their environmental responsibilities very seriously, while also focussing on producing high quality, affordable, traceable food and adhering to world leading standards of animal welfare.”",

Sadly, he could not give a straight answer to a basic question, but I know that surrendering such strategic territory in a pivotal moment of world politics, is not a decision that is in the best interest of the UK’s ongoing security.\nEarlier on this week I joined farmers and fellow MPs as we continue our campaign against this Labour Government’s Family Farm Tax. Despite over 200,000 people signing a petition, with nearly 5 months of ongoing campaigns, this Government has still shown no indication of altering the vastly unpopular policy. It goes to show that Labour has no interest in listening to the voices of people if it doesn’t align with their exact vision.\nI had the privilege of Battle Town Council’s Youth Forum joining me for a visit of Parliament, followed by a Q&A session. They asked some important questions about the challenges which our local community in Battle face. I hope that I was able to give them answers they can go away and consider while representing Battle in the future.\nThis week, I was fortunate to have secured a debate in Parliament to discuss the benefits of deep geothermal energy—an underutilized resource with the potential to provide clean, reliable heating while enhancing our energy security. With the right support from the Government, deep geothermal could bring jobs, investment, and lower energy costs to East Sussex and other areas with untapped potential.\nLast week I had the pleasure of attending a reception in Parliament organised by the Sussex Community Foundation, which was a great opportunity to meet more of the people involved in the group, including patrons, donors, and supporters.\nFollowing my meeting with the Bexhill-on-Sea Working Age Parkinson’s Group last year, I attended the APPG on Parkinson’s meeting to discuss the challenges facing neurological cases in the NHS. The NHS long-term workforce plan refresh is a vital opportunity to invest in specialist staff and improve access to care.\nLast month we celebrated National Apprenticeship week, a great opportunity for employers and employees alike. I met with James Gordon from Engineering UK, and spoke about the value of apprenticeships, and how we can make them fit for the future.\nEnglish Tourism Week will be with us soon! This is a great opportunity for tourist activities and sites to get out and share the attractions we have locally – and we really do have so many! I’ll be discussing these a little bit more in my next newsletter, but in the meantime check out VisitEngland's website in the article below to see some of the things that we have going on locally.\nI was pleased for the opportunity to meet with Pancreatic Cancer UK, at their parliamentary reception, to speak about shortages of vital medications used by pancreatic cancer sufferers, which can have devastating impact for pancreatic cancer sufferers. The Government must work with NHS organisations to improve communication around what patients should do if they struggle to access these medicines, and I will continue to hold them to account over this.\nMarch is Brain Tumour Awareness Month, and in recognition of this, I joined the Brain Tumour Charity to raise awareness around how the National Cancer Plan risks letting brain tumours fall through the gaps. From my conversations with those families affected by brain tumours, I have written to the Department of Health and Social Care to raise concerns about how brain tumours are graded and how this affects access to treatment and support. I will continue to push for better awareness, research, and early diagnosis.\nWe celebrated World Book Day this week, supported by a charity of the same name that works with publishers to offer a selection of £1 books, ensuring that every child can access a book of some form. It’s important to help more children discover the joy of reading and build a lifelong habit that opens doors to endless possibilities.\nIn the constituency I met with the Bexhill Chamber of Commerce for a networking breakfast, where I got to speak with many local business owners and heard first-hand about the issues affecting them. Thanks to Battle Chamber President, Darren Buss, and Vice-President Sarah Truman for organising such a productive meeting and thanks to the team The Bull Inn for hosting.\nI also visited with members and volunteers of Hurst Green’s Over-75s breakfast club last Friday. The club meets twice a month in Hurst Green Village Hall and is run by Elaine Ralph with the support of a group of enthusiastic and dedicated volunteers who prepare a Full English Breakfast for its members. A big thank you to Elaine and all the volunteers who give so much of their time and energy to running the club.\nI thought it important join the local Ukrainian Choir, Voices of Volya, last weekend at the De La Warr Pavilion to support the launch of their fundraising book. As part of their book launch an exhibition is on display at the De La Warr Pavilion. Check out the article below for full details.\nSupporting the push for broader employment opportunities highlighted in National Apprenticeship Week, I’m looking forward to being a part of the Bexhill Jobs and Apprenticeships Fair taking place at the De La Warr Pavilion on Friday 21 March. Make sure to pre-register to speed up entry on the day!\nAnd lastly, I wanted to share Rother District Council’s consultation for feedback on its proposed Housing Development Strategy, which will guide housing decisions in our area for the next five years. I encourage residents of our constituency to participate so your thoughts are taken into consideration when finalising plans.\nHave a great weekend.\nIn this week's newsletter:\n- Challenging the PM at PMQs\n- Stop The Family Farm Tax March\n- Battle Town Council Youth Forum Visit Parliament\n- Westminster Hall Debate on Deep Geothermal\n- Sussex Community Foundation\n- Parkinson's APPG Meeting\n- National Apprenticeships Week\n- English Tourism Week\n- Pancreatic Cancer UK Reception\n- Brain Tumour Awareness Month\n- World Book Day!\n- Bexhill Chamber Of Commerce Networking Breakfast\n- Hurst Green Over-75s Breakfast Club\n- Voices of Volya Book Launch\n- Bexhill Jobs and Apprenticeships Fair\n- Bexhill & Battle Residents: Have Your Say on Local Housing Development\nChallenging the PM at PMQs\nLast week, I asked the Prime Minister a question in PMQs. I decided to raise the Government’s recent announcement on increasing defence spending, and challenged whether any of this money would then be used to fund the planned surrender of the Chagos Islands to China’s ally Mauritius.\nMy question came ahead of a meeting between the PM and US President Trump.\nCommitments to defence spending are clearly an important aspect of our future relationship with the US, so credibility is vital. It would then be concerning to find out that the promised boost in defence funding includes future payments to Mauritius, instead of going towards our security in Europe.\nI think it is wrong for the UK to surrender valuable strategic territory in an area of the world which is becoming increasingly important. If the Government feels they must follow through with a deal, I certainly do not believe that funding should then come from our defence commitments.\nThis money should be prioritised for our real defence capabilities, not going into the pocket of a country which stands in opposition to the West.\nSadly, the PM was unable to give a straight answer to my yes or no question, much like he would not give a clear position to Kemi when she asked the same question.\nAll of us in the House, and I’m sure across the country, wanted to see the meeting in Washington D.C. to go well. It was disappointing the PM felt that he could not offer a simple answer to a basic question.\nStop The Family Farm Tax March\nEarlier this week, I joined with farmers and fellow MPs to continue our campaign against this Labour Government’s Family Farm Tax, which will have dire consequences for so many small family farms across the country.\nThe Stop Family Farm Tax campaign has now been active for close to 5 months, since the Budget, with no indication of a change in policy by this Government.\nThis is despite the Conservative Party handing in a petition to 10 Downing Street, which more than 200,000 people had signed over a couple of months, showing just how unpopular this decision is!\nI was pleased to join with farmers as we marched from Parliament Square, down Whitehall to the gates of 10 Downing Street.\nWe will continue our campaign against this decision and make sure ours and farmers voices are heard.\nBattle Town Council Youth Forum Visit Parliament\nIt was my honour to have the Battle Town Council Youth Forum visit Parliament this week, alongside Cllr Andrew Barton and Cllr Vikki Cook for a tour and a Q&A session with me.\nMeeting young people is my favourite part of being an MP, as you get to speak with the future generation and what is important to them as they grow up.\nAll the members of the Youth Forum have already taken that first step of wanting to get involved in politics, so we might well have had some future politicians in the room!\nThere were fantastic questions asked, which I know to have been written by members of the Forum themselves, about some of the challenges our local community faces. I hope that I was able to give them answers they can go away and consider while representing Battle in the future.\nThank you to the whole Youth Forum, and those Cllrs who joined, for making the journey up to Parliament to speak with me and to learn a little more about the history of democracy in the UK.\nWestminster Hall Debate on Deep Geothermal\nThis week, I was fortunate to have secured a debate in Parliament to discuss the benefits of deep geothermal energy, an underutilised resource with the potential to provide clean, reliable heating while enhancing our energy security.\nEast Sussex, in particular, holds significant geothermal potential. Beneath our feet, we have hot sedimentary aquifers that could supply sustainable heat to our hospitals, schools, homes, and businesses. As we face the need to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and protect ourselves from rising energy costs, deep geothermal offers a stable, year-round source of energy—just as it does across Europe.\nUnfortunately, while countries like France and Germany are already reaping the rewards of this technology, the UK is falling behind. With the right support from the Government, deep geothermal could bring jobs, investment, and lower energy costs to East Sussex and other areas with untapped potential.\nI will continue to push Ministers to back this vital industry and ensure that communities like ours don’t miss out on this opportunity for clean energy and economic growth.\nIf you would like to read the debate on Hansard, click here.\nSussex Community Foundation\nIt was a great pleasure to attend the reception organised by the Sussex Community Foundation in Parliament last week.\nHaving recently met with the charity’s CEO, Kevin Richmond, in Bexhill, this was a great opportunity to meet more people involved in the Sussex Community Foundation, including patrons, donors and supporters. This charity operates exclusively in Sussex to help fund community groups and charities across a range of causes with a focus on tackling poverty, improving health, reaching potential and acting on climate.\nIt was good to see some familiar faces at the event including Abi Newbury, Chair of Bexhill Town Board, Cllr Ian Hollidge, ESCC, Cllr Richard Thomas, RDC and Cllr Paul Wilson, Bexhill Town Council.\nIt was also good to make some new acquaintances, including Quenelda and Julian Avery, and Jeremy Field of CPJ Field & Co in Battle. They are all strong supporters and really understand the importance of SCF in supporting our local Sussex communities.\nParkinson's APPG Meeting\nLast December, I had the privilege of meeting with the Bexhill-on-Sea Working Age Parkinson’s Group. Hearing their personal experiences was extremely informative. Thank you again for having me.\nI attended the APPG on Parkinson’s meeting to discuss the challenges facing neurological care in the NHS. Right now, 233,555 people in England are waiting for an NHS neurology appointment, with nearly half waiting longer than the 18-week target. Workforce shortages mean access to specialist care varies significantly across the country, leaving many without the support they need.\nWith 1 in 6 people in the UK living with a neurological condition, including Parkinson’s, we must take action. Parkinson’s is the fastest growing neurological condition in the world, affecting 153,000 people in the UK today.\nThe NHS long-term workforce plan refresh is a vital opportunity to invest in specialist staff and improve access to care.\nNational Apprenticeship Week\nLast month, we celebrated National Apprenticeship Week! A week that is great news for potential apprentices and for employers.\nAt a parliamentary reception I met with James Gordon from Engineering UK about the value of apprenticeships, and how we can make them fit for the future. Engineering UK is a not-for-profit group, campaigning to drive more young people into engineering and technology careers. They’re doing fantastic work connecting businesses with talented individuals, leading efforts to improve how apprenticeships work and access to them.\nApprenticeships are a great path for so many different people and can change lives. You could be a school leaver who is looking for careers direction, you could be someone who wants to break into their dream industry, or you could be someone looking for a career change. Apprenticeships are for everyone!\nIf you want to harness your talent and unlock your potential, you should look at the National Apprenticeship Week website. You can explore fantastic opportunities from employers such as Volkswagen, Network Rail, EY, the Army and many more. They have a careers advice hub and virtual events which can give you tips and tricks to secure the right apprenticeship for you.\n#NAW2025\nhttps://nationalapprenticeshipweek.co.uk/\nEnglish Tourism Week\nI was pleased to attend VisitEngland’s Parliamentary drop-in where I heard about their work to attract tourism to our area.\nIt is now only a couple of weeks until English Tourism Week, an annual celebration of the English tourism sector, which will take place from 14-23 March.\nThis year’s theme is ‘Supporting people and places to drive growth’, and I’m happy to support this celebration as there is certainly a lot to promote in our constituency.\nWe have some amazing attractions, such as visiting Battle Abbey and Battlefield; taking in the artwork of the De La Warr Pavilion; or exploring Bodiam’s Roman history.\nVisitEngland’s website has done well to advertise these cultural activities as part of the 1066 heritage area, as well as the restaurants and vineyards we are so lucky to have – there is something for everyone!\nWith Spring now on the way, take advantage of days with good weather to support English Tourism Week. You can check out VisitEngland for some more information things to do - https://www.visit1066country.com/\nI look forward to supporting VisitEngland as they work to increase tourism and boost our local economy through #EnglishTourismWeek25.\nPancreatic Cancer UK Reception\nAfter a number of constituents asked me I attended Pancreatic Cancer UK's reception to talk about shortages of vital medicines used by pancreatic cancer sufferers.\nMore than 61,000 people across the UK rely on these medicines and, in a recent survey by Pancreatic Cancer UK, 82% of those people struggled to access their prescription on more than one occasion.\nIf those suffering from pancreatic cancer can't access these medicines, it can have devastating effects on their quality of life. The Government must strengthen its response to address and resolve the shortages and the impact they are having on people with pancreatic cancer, and I recently wrote to the Department for Health and Social Care to ask how they plan to address this.\nThe Government must work with NHS organisations to improve communication around what patients should do if they struggle to access these medicines, and I will continue to hold them to account over this.\nPancreatic Cancer UK run a helpline for anyone who is worried about Pancreatic Cancer, which you can contact via 0808 801 0707 or [email protected]. You can also learn more about the symptoms of pancreatic cancer on their website: https://www.pancreaticcancer.org.uk/\nBrain Tumour Awareness Month\nMarch is Brain Tumour Awareness Month, and in recognition of this, I joined the Brain Tumour Charity to raise awareness around how the National Cancer Plan risks letting brain tumours fall through the gaps.\nBrain tumours are the biggest cancer killer of those under 40, and every year, 12,000 people in the UK are diagnosed with one.\nTreatment is most effective when cancer is caught early, but because brain tumours don’t usually spread like other cancers, 49% aren’t technically classified as cancerous. As a result, NHS programmes focused on early diagnosis often miss them, leading to longer waiting times for patients. Unlike other cancers, brain tumours are graded rather than staged, and because they rarely spread beyond stage 1, they are often left out of key cancer treatment programmes.\nAt the event, I met Oriana, whose father recently passed away after his brain tumour was misdiagnosed. She shared her story about the challenges he faced in getting a diagnosis and treatment, highlighting the urgent need for improvements in early detection and support.\nWe’ve also written to the Department of Health and Social Care to raise concerns about how brain tumours are graded and how this affects access to treatment and support.\nThe Brain Tumour Charity is calling for dedicated action in the National Cancer Plan to ensure brain tumours don’t fall through the gaps. I will continue to push for better awareness, research, and early diagnosis so that more families don’t have to go through what Oriana’s has.\nIf you’d like to learn more or support their work, visit: https://www.thebraintumourcharity.org/\nWorld Book Day!\nThis week we celebrated World Book Day (6th March).\nI was a big reader as a child and a teen, and I think it helps you a lot in later life! When reading is fun, children are more likely to do it. But for many, it feels like homework rather than an enjoyable escape, and sadly, only 1 in 7 parents read to their child for fun once a month or less.\nThis is why I’m happy to support and promote #WorldBookDay2025.\nThe World Book Day Charity works with publishers to offer a selection of £1/€1.50 books, ensuring every child can find something they love. With their £1/€1.50 token, kids can pick a book for free, thanks to distribution through schools, early years settings, magazines—and even in McDonald’s Happy Meals!\nLet’s help more children discover the joy of reading and build a lifelong habit that opens doors to endless possibilities.\nIn support of this campaign, I picked up a copy of a book called “The Wolf Trials” by Kiran Millwood Hargrave, which I look forward to passing on to a young reader in the constituency.\nFind out more or get in touch with the World Book Day charity at [email protected] and by visiting their website https://www.worldbookday.com/.\nBexhill Chamber of Commerce Networking Breakfast\nIt was really good to meet with so many local business owners at the Battle Chamber of Commerce networking breakfast last Friday and to hear first-hand about the issues which affect them.\nSmall businesses are vital to towns like Battle by providing employment opportunities, economic growth and ensuring our high streets remain an important focal point for the community.\nI know that issues like parking, traffic congestion, business rates and crime affect their ability to grow and thrive which is why I am keen to support them in their bid to ensure Battle remains a thriving town in which to live and work as well as an attractive place to visit.\nThanks to Battle Chamber President, Darren Buss, and Vice-President Sarah Truman for organising such a productive meeting and thanks to the team The Bull Inn for hosting.\nDo check out their Facebook linked here for news and updates.\nHurst Green Over-75s Breakfast Club\nIt was a real pleasure to visit the members and volunteers of Hurst Green Over-75s breakfast club last Friday. The club meets twice a month in Hurst Green Village Hall and is run by Elaine Ralph with the support of a group of enthusiastic and dedicated volunteers who prepare a Full English Breakfast for its members.\nHaving spent time chatting to everyone, it is clear to see that this social event is so important to the senior members of the Hurst Green village community. The club helps to alleviate loneliness and isolation which can be a real problem for those living in rural areas. And, for some, it is a welcome break from full-time caring responsibilities.\nOne of the social issues that drew me to politics was loneliness and social isolation - as a former A&E doctor seeing older patients in hospital and I saw firsthand the direct impact it had on them.\nI should like to say a big thank you to Elaine and all the volunteers who give so much of their time and energy to running the club.\nRead more on my website here.\nVoices of Volya Book Launch\nI thought it was important to join the local Ukrainian Choir, Voices of Volya, last weekend at the De La Warr Pavilion to support the launch of their fundraising book.\nI expressed my ongoing admiration for the Ukrainian people and their country. Zelensky is an incredibly brave leader who deserves our support.\nAs part of their book launch an exhibition is on display at the De La Warr Pavilion until 15th March, with the voices of Volya performing for 20 minutes at 11am and 2pm on 15th March. To find out more click here.\nBexhill Jobs & Apprenticeships Fair\nI'm so pleased to be part of the Bexhill Jobs and Apprenticeships Fair, which will be taking place at the De La Warr Pavilion on Friday 21 March, from 10.30am until 3.30pm.\nThere will be over 50 exhibitors with jobs and opportunities in sectors including hospitality, transport, health & social care, financial services, manufacturing, engineering, construction, tourism, the creative industries and more.\nNot long now so do pre-register to speed up entry on the day and read more about the fair in the link below.\nBexhill & Battle Residents: Have Your Say on Local Housing Development\nRother District Council is seeking feedback on its proposed Housing Development Strategy, which will guide housing decisions in our area for the next five years. I encourage residents of Bexhill and Battle to participate in the consultation.\nThis strategy will influence the type and location of new housing developments. It's important that local voices are heard on this issue.\nYou can find more information and share your views in the consultation by March 31st here: https://www.rother.gov.uk/consultations/housing-development-strategy-consultation/\nFeedback can also be submitted by email: [email protected] or by post: Housing Development Strategy Consultation, Rother District Council, Town Hall, Bexhill-on-Sea, TN39 3JX.",

The club’s volunteers also offer lifts to and from the village hall for those who may struggle to attend to make sure no one misses out due to transport or mobility problems.\nKieran said “I was made to feel so welcome by the volunteers and members of the breakfast club. Having spent time chatting to everyone, it is clear to see that this social event is so important to the senior members of the Hurst Green village community. The club helps to alleviate loneliness and isolation which can be a real problem for those living in rural areas. And, for some, it is a welcome break from full-time caring responsibilities. One of the social issues that drew me to politics was loneliness and social isolation - as a former A&E doctor seeing older patients in hospital and I saw firsthand the direct impact it had on them.\n“It would be great if every village had an Over 75s Breakfast Club like Hurst Green. It creates a sense of belonging the community, sharing news and enjoying company of friends and making new friends. They also look out for each other and are quick to notice when someone is experiencing illness or problems.\n“I should like to say a big thank you to Elaine and all the volunteers who give so much of their time and energy to running the club. I should also like to thank Hurst Green parish council for their financial support of the club, its exactly the sort of project that a parish council should support, they set a great example to others.”\nThe Over 75s Breakfast Club is always looking to raise funds to cover their costs. If any other local organisations or businesses would like to sponsor the club or donate to the regular fund-raising raffle, please contact [email protected] who will put you in touch with the organisers.",

The money being announced now was already committed by the Conservative Government under the Bexhill Town Deal. It is unfortunate that the Labour government are trying to pass this off as their initiative and funding they are awarding as if it were a new decision by them. We must be clear that it is not a new investment, but rather a continuation of previous commitments.\"\nHe added:\n\"Those of us helping come up with a plan for the Bexhill Town Deal funding remain committed to doing everything we can to support projects and ideas that are going to make a real difference to Bexhill.”",

  "https_www_drkieranmullan_org_uk_/https_www_drkieranmullan_org_uk_campaigns_housing-and-local-planning/content_39.html": "Housing and planning is an important issue in the Bexhill and Battle constituency. I know that many local people have concerns, whether it be due to the type of development proposed in their area, or worries about the lack of affordable housing, particularly for young people.\nThe aspiration of homeownership is a fundamental value I support. It provides greater security and people become more rooted in their communities. Currently, too many people are being prevented from getting on the housing ladder and are being prevented from seeing the benefits of homeownership that their parents’ generation enjoyed. Moreover, it is essential that the local transport infrastructure and services fully support these ambitions, if they are to be achieved.\nWhilst it is important that we provide new homes that local people can afford to buy locally, affordability and supply concerns should not override everything else. Similarly, eco-friendly design should not be the sole consideration- beauty and a design code in keeping with existing design elements are also important.\nMy position has always been that we must build the right houses in the right places. This is especially true in our constituency which has a high proportion of land in protected zones, like the Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). I want it to be easier to build much needed houses where it is right to do so, but see more protections for areas where more housing is not appropriate.\nI will be actively working with parish councils to ensure planning priorities are supported by local communities. This, as well as Neighbourhood Plans are key to achieving long-term local planning and housing goals.\nTo alleviate flooding risk and support bio-diversity net gain, application assessment, monitoring and planning enforcement are as, if not more, important and require greater resources going forward.",

  "https_www_drkieranmullan_org_uk_/https_www_drkieranmullan_org_uk_animal-testing-peta-campaign-and-edm-210/content_57.html": "Thank you for contacting me about animal testing. Unfortunately, I am not able to attend the upcoming PETA Event in Parliament, due to a previously arranged Parliamentary business.\nI completely understand that the use of animals in science, including toxicity testing, is a sensitive issue, and as such I welcome that the UK is one of the world's leading nations in the development of non-animal methods. I am keen to ensure that these are utilised wherever is possible and I will support work which aims to accelerate the point at which animal research and testing is no longer necessary, having been fully replaced by effective alternatives. Sadly, however, technology is not yet at a point to wholly replace animal testing for important applications tackling some of the most significant human health conditions.\nTherefore, I understand the current approach is to support and accelerate advances in biomedical science and technology to reduce reliance on the use of animals in research. To achieve this, funding has been used to support the development and dissemination of the three Rs which aim to replace the use of animals not necessary for research; to reduce the use of animals in the meantime; and to refine to eliminate or reduce distress to those animals already involved. This is primarily delivered through the National Centre for 3Rs (the NC3Rs) and since it was established, the NC3Rs has invested £89.3 million in research and £27 million in contracts through its CRACK IT Challenges innovation scheme for UK and EU based institutions, with that funding mainly focused on approaches for safer assessment of pharmaceuticals. It was most welcome that, in February 2024, the previous Conservative Minister responsible announced that investment to the NC3Rs was to double from £10 million per year to £20 million per year. It is to be hoped that the new Government will sustain this level of funding.\nAs you may know, the former Government took decisive action in this area, including banning cosmetic testing on animals.

  "https_www_drkieranmullan_org_uk_/https_www_drkieranmullan_org_uk_news_newsletter-14/content_65.html": "Welcome to this week's newsletter!\nThis week’s newsletter begins on a sombre note as we reflect on Holocaust Memorial Day, a time to remember the millions who suffered and reaffirm our commitment to a future free from hatred. I attended the Holocaust Memorial Day Ceremony in Parliament and heard the incredible story of survivor Yisrael Abelesz. His experiences in Auschwitz were a powerful reminder of the horrors of the past and the importance of remembrance.\nWith each year, fewer survivors remain to share their stories—it is our duty to keep their memories alive and ensure such atrocities never happen again. This year’s theme, 'For a Better Future', reminds us to stand against hatred and persecution in all its forms.\nI’ve also been busy across the constituency, meeting local groups and attending events that highlight the fantastic work happening in our community.\nI was grateful for the chance to tour St Michael’s Hospice and witness first hand the compassionate care they provide. Though based outside of my constituency they have provided care to many Bexhill & Battle constituents. I also heard about the challenges they’re facing and am committed to supporting them to ensure they can continue their vital services.\nIt was also wonderful to visit Saxonwood Care Home in Battle and say happy birthday to 90 year old resident Georgie Farrow and thank her for the amazing fundraising she has achieved for St Michael’s Hospice and the Royal British Legion.\nResidents of Ticehurst may have heard that Wadhurst Medical Practice is planning to close its surgery due to fire safety concerns with the building. I recently met with local councillors to discuss the potential impact on residents and explore alternatives to ensure a surgery remains in Ticehurst. We received good news shortly after that no change will be happening in the short term.\nIn addition to local matters, I’ve been involved in discussions in Parliament that are directly relevant to our constituency.\nBexhill and Battle is home to many fantastic hospitality businesses, but their future is at risk due to Labour’s national insurance hike. I met with hospitality leaders at a UK Hospitality event to discuss how we can create a better environment for businesses to thrive and help our high streets flourish.\nI also joined the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Rural Affairs to discuss funding challenges facing our rural communities. We’re campaigning to ensure rural services get the support they need, especially after the Government removed the Rural Services Delivery Grant and proposed further cuts to rural funding.\nAfter hearing from several constituents, I met with the Brain Tumour Charity to discuss the challenges brain tumour patients face, particularly around early diagnosis. I’ve committed to raising these concerns with the Department of Health and Social Care to improve support for brain tumour diagnosis and treatment.\nRibena has always been a personal favourite of mine, so it was a pleasure to meet with local blackcurrant farmers from Bexhill and Battle at a reception in Parliament. Unfortunately, Labour's anti-farming policies are impacting family farms, with many struggling to hire new staff. I’m committed to reversing these policies to support our farmers and ensure Ribena remains a staple for years to come.\nLastly, I was fortunate to secure a timely debate on the New Hospital Programme last week, following the Government’s decision to delay the hospitals completion to 2039 at the earliest.\nHave a great weekend.\nIn this newsletter:\n- Holocaust Memorial Day\n- Battle Pavilion Football Foundation\n- Saxonwood Care Home\n- St Michaels Hospice Visit\n- Battle Baptist Church visit\n- Ticehurst GP meeting with Local Cllrs\n- Hospitality meet and greet\n- Rural APPG\n- Brain tumour charity\n- Blackcurrent Growers\n- New Hospitals Programme Delayed\nHolocaust Memorial Day\nParliament has had a series of events to mark Holocaust Memorial Day including an event in Parliament where I listened to the story of Holocaust survivor Yisrael Abelesz. Yisrael is a Hungarian Jew whose life was changed forever in March 1944 when Nazi Germany invaded Hungary. He remembers seeing Jewish businesses attacked, being forced to wear the yellow star and eventually being taken to Auschwitz.\nAt Auschwitz Yisrael had the misfortune of coming face-to-face with Joseph Mengele, was separated from his family and never saw his parents or younger brother again. He however, managed to escape death on three occasions which he described in my conversation with him.\nAt first guards offered to take him to a children’s camp, but knowing something was awry he chose to stay put and thankfully avoided execution. On a second occasion he ran away from a prisoner round up, a guard caught him as he ran but told Yisrael to feign struggle and run away whilst he could. His third escape came when hiding from a kapo in a Russian barracks at the camp, where he was shielded and protected by fellow prisoners. He credited his ‘determination to survive’ which stayed with him all the time, which reminds me of the importance of hope in our own lives.\nYisrael’s powerful and thought provoking story is one of many. Those who suffered untold horrors during the Holocaust must be remembered, as with each year there are fewer and fewer people still living who suffered this atrocity. It is our duty to keep their memory alive and ensure nothing like this can ever happen again.\nOn Holocaust Memorial Day itself I was at the national ceremony attended by the Prince and Princess of Wales and the Prime Minister where we considered the theme for this year's memorial day: 'For a better future'. This calls on us empathise with those suffering today, in the here and now, and for us all to work together towards a future free from hatred, persecution and violence. You can light your own candle of remembrance this evening.\nIf you would like to read about Yisrael’s story here:\nhttps://hmd.org.uk/resource/yisrael-abelesz/\nMeeting with Football foundation at Battle Pavilion\nI was really pleased to welcome Lee Suter from the Football Federation and Paul Saunders from Sussex FA to Battle last Friday to talk about the project to re-build the Battle Pavilion to make it fit for the future and ensure football is accessible to all.\nBattle Town Council, Battle Football and local residents have been working really hard for many years to provide new facilities in Battle Recreation Ground. They are close to delivering on the project but there are still some hurdles to cross and finance which needs to be raised. It was good to have the advice and support from Lee and Paul as to how we can bring this project to reality.\nI’ll be continuing to work with the town council to make sure this project gets over the line.\nSaxonwood Care Home\nLast Friday, I had the great pleasure of visiting the residents and staff at Saxonwood Care Home in Battle last Friday. This care home is run by Sussex Housing and Care which has 3 care homes across Sussex as well as sheltered housing. It is a not for profit housing association and I had the opportunity to talk to CEO, Tracy Evans, about the current challenges facing the care and housing sector.\nI had some interesting chats with residents about their lives and we discussed local and national issues too. I was pleased for the opportunity to meet and thank resident Georgie Farrow, who has just celebrated her 90th birthday, for the amazing fundraising she has achieved for St Michael’s Hospice (which I’d visited earlier that day) and the Royal British Legion. I was happy to contribute to her fundraising in return for a fantastic woolly hat she had knitted for me!\nThere is such a happy and welcoming atmosphere at Saxonwood thanks to the wonderful staff who work hard to look after the residents and ensure they are fully involved in the Battle community.\nVisit to St Michaels Hospice\nSt Michael’s Hospice across the constituency border in Hastings supports patients and families across Hastings, Bexhill and Rother including my constituents and so I was delighted to accept their invitation to visit them to find out more about the care they provide to local residents at the hospice and out in the community.\nI had a tour of the hospice and was pleased to meet and speak with staff based there including those working in administration, physiotherapy, manning the 24 hour helplines, community nursing and caring for those staying at the hospice. It was clear from my conversations just how much people love working for the hospice and they have such pride in their work.\nAfterwards, I met with the senior leadership team to discuss the challenges facing the hospice sector. Without the support of over 450 volunteers working across the organisation - in its charity shops, as bereavement councillors, fundraisers and in many other roles, the hospice could not provide the vital palliative care and extended services which they do. Less than 30% of their funding comes from central government.\nThis is a critical time for the hospice sector and I will be giving St Michael’s my full support.\nBattle Baptist Church\nI rounded off a busy afternoon in Battle last week with a visit to the team at Battle Baptist Church. It was good to chat with Minister Ed Jones, Administrator Jo Reeves, and Elder Gary Walsh about their church and its community outreach.\nIt is clearly a very busy and active church embedded in the local community with lots of activities for all generations including an on-site pre-school, toddler group, youth group and fellowship group. It was great to see Gary for the second time that day - he’d been at the earlier meeting about Battle Rec football pavilion, being an active member of Battle FC, for which Ed is also the chaplain. They explained that Battle FC had started as the Battle Baptist Football Club some years ago and has gone from strength to strength since then.\nTicehurst GP meeting with Local Cllrs\nLast week, I met with local Councillors Eleanor Kirby-Green and Mary Barnes to discuss the future with Ticehurst Surgery.\nIt’s been reported that the building used by Ticehurst Surgery doesn’t meet fire safety rules, and Wadhurst Medical Group, who runs the practice, had said they are considering moving all patients to the Wadhurst site by March 2025.\nI understand how much Ticehurst residents value having healthcare close to home and how disruptive this situation could be for many. That’s why I contacted NHS Sussex to raise these concerns and better understand what the issues are and whether there are alternative solutions. They have since announced that they will remain on site for now.\nI’ll keep working with everyone involved to try to get the best outcome for Ticehurst and will share updates as things develop.\nHospitality UK Meet & Greet\nI might be smiling in this photo, because I want to celebrate all our fantastic local hospitality businesses.\nBut thanks to Labour raising National Insurance contributions for businesses, hiring staff is much harder, holding back growth and jeopardising the survival of businesses that are the lifeblood of communities in Bexhill and Battle. The changes to the minimum wage for teenagers will also hit hospitality hard and make it more difficult for our young people to get their first job.\nI met with hospitality leaders in Parliament this week to discuss these issues and others facing small businesses, and reaffirmed my commitment to do what I can to create the best possible business environment to help our high streets thrive.\nRural Services APPG\nThis week I met with the All-Party Parliamentary Group on rural affairs to discuss some of the most pressing issues facing our rural communities.\nWe spoke of the need to make sure our rural services are properly funded, and getting the attention they deserve from the Government. Our communities cannot be ignored at the expense of urban councils.\nThe Rural Services Delivery Grant gave £110m to 94 rural authorities last year to assist in the running of vital public services. This has now been removed by the Government before the conclusion of a consultation they launched to assess funding awarded to rural areas.\nThis comes as the government plans to change the basic formula as well with their initial proposals further cutting funding for rural areas like ours.\nThis is a slap in the face to local voices in rural communities. The Government doesn’t understand our communities, and isn’t allocating appropriate funding to accommodate our ageing population and the unique needs of our community.\nI've already raised these issues with government and at the meeting we all agreed to continue our campaign to get the government to change course.\nMeeting with The Brain Tumour Charity\nA number of constituents asked if I would meet with the Brain Tumour Charity, and as such, last week I met with them to discuss the critical issues surrounding brain tumours and how we can work together to raise awareness and improve outcomes for those affected.\nWe talked about how the current targets for improving cancer survival won't bring much improvement for brain cancer patients because it nearly always presents much later. This means that Brain Tumours often don’t appear in early diagnosis data like other cancers. I’ve committed to writing to the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) to ask how this impacts diagnosis and what can be done to ensure brain tumours aren’t left behind in early diagnosis initiatives.\nThank you to The Brain Tumour Charity for their vital work—I’m proud to support their efforts to raise awareness and improve outcomes.\nBlackcurrant Growers In Bexhill and Battle\nRibena has been a staple of birthday parties, social gatherings and most recently parliamentary receptions for years! I was lucky enough to be joined in Parliament by our fantastic family farmers growing blackcurrants for Ribena here in our constituency of Bexhill and Battle; Tom Maynard, of Maynard farms alongside Michael and Peter Reeves from Reeves F. J. Farms.\nWe attended an informative and tasty reception hosted by Ribena, where I spoke to Elsie Seibold, the Chief Operating Officer of Ribena, about their recent Blackcurrant growers survey and learned that farmers growing for Ribena represent over 90% of the UK's blackcurrant crop!\nUnfortunately, this survey also revealed that the impact I feared from Labour's anti-farming budget has affected those same family farmers growing for Ribena. Only a third of Ribena's farmers expect their business to grow over the next year, and shockingly only 10% expect to take on new staff over the same period. It is clear the that Labour's Family Farm Tax and Jobs Tax have slammed the breaks on British farming.\nFamily farms like our Ribena growers here in Bexhill and Battle are facing a combative government, unwilling to admit their mistakes, and who would rather see fewer jobs and less growth than admit they are wrong.\nWe will reverse Labour's damaging policies, and ensure Blackcurrants grown here can be enjoyed at parties, in homes and not least by me for years to come!\nNew Hospital Programme Delays\nThis week, I was fortunate to secure a Westminster Hall debate on the New Hospital Programme, which gave me the opportunity to talk about the implications of the governments decision to delay the planned upgrades to our local hospitals.\nEastbourne DGH, Conquest Hospital, and Bexhill Community Hospital are vital to our community, but plans to rebuild, modernise, and expand these facilities have been pushed back to 2039 at the earliest.\nEast Sussex Healthcare Trust faces a critical infrastructure risk of £64 million, part of an overall £300 million backlog in repairs. Without urgent investment, the total cost of repairs is expected to rise to £460 million within a decade.\nDuring the debate, I urged the government to deliver immediate support for East Sussex hospitals to tackle critical maintenance backlogs.\nThere must be interim funding to address urgent repairs and to ensure our hospitals can continue to deliver safe, effective care while modernisation plans progress. Delay must not mean deterioration.",
  "https_www_drkieranmullan_org_uk_/https_www_drkieranmullan_org_uk_news_sentence-nicholas-prosper-be-reviewed-court-appeal/content_36.html": "I welcome the Government taking forward my referral of the sentence for murderer Nicholas Prosper. These were the most heinous crimes deserving of the most severe penalty a court can give.\nProsper murdered his mother Juliana Falcon, and his siblings Giselle (13) and Kyle (16), in a brutal attack in their family home. Despite this, the judge declined to impose a whole life order — meaning Prosper could one day be released.\nFollowing widespread concern, I wrote to the Attorney General asking for the sentence to be reviewed under the Unduly Lenient Sentence Scheme. The Solicitor General has now confirmed that the case is being referred.\nThis was a horrific crime. The original sentence failed to reflect its seriousness and left many people rightly outraged.\nThere’s a clear gap between what most law-abiding people consider justice and what is too often delivered in court. The idea that someone who commits an act like this could eventually walk free is incomprehensible to many.\nThe Court of Appeal now has the opportunity to put this right. The victims — and the public — deserve nothing less.\nRead more about this story in the link below:",

The new Labour Government have agreed to this plan and will have to agree any final decisions. They promised to strengthen the post office network in their election manifesto.\nI know just how important the Bexhill Post Office is to the residents of Bexhill and surrounding rural areas. The loss of four major banks from our high streets has had a big impact on the town and residents were told that their day to day banking needs could be met by the Post Office. It is therefore vital that we do not lose this service or the highly experienced Post Office staff who understand and serve the community so well.\nIf you would like to support me in this campaign, please sign the petition so we make it clear to Post Office and the Government that we value this local service.\nThe petition will close on 31 December 2024.\nThe petition will be sent to the CEO of Post Office Ltd and the Minister with responsibility for the Post Office at the Department for Business and Trade, Gareth Thomas MP.\nIf you don't have an email you can enter [email protected]",
  "https_www_drkieranmullan_org_uk_/https_www_drkieranmullan_org_uk_news_kieran-urges-health-secretary-clear-timeline-new-hospital-programme-review/content_34.html": "Following the Budget, Dr Kieran Mullan MP has written to the Health Secretary to reiterate the urgent need for a clear timeline on the New Hospital Programme Review, which impacts Eastbourne District General Hospital and Conquest Hospital. These two hospitals are critical healthcare providers for constituents of Bexhill and Battle, and their futures hang in the balance pending the outcome of the review.\nDuring a recent meeting to update all MPs with schemes in scope of the review, MPs were informed that the Department for Health and Social Care would have greater insight into the review’s timeline following the Autumn Statement. While reassured by commitments to major investment in hospitals, Kieran noted that critical questions remain unanswered regarding exact timescales and budget allocations.\n“My constituents, as well as our hospital stakeholders, need to know when these essential projects will be delivered,” Kieran said. \"The business cases for both hospitals are progressing well, with Eastbourne District General Hospital in an advanced phase. However, without timely decisions, growing construction costs risk jeopardising these projects.”\nThe letter calls on the Health Secretary to establish a clear timeline for the review’s completion and to ensure that the projects move forward without further delay. “Our communities deserve assurance that the necessary healthcare infrastructure will be delivered,” Kieran added.\nKieran remains committed to securing the resources and clarity needed to advance these critical healthcare projects and will continue working to ensure the best outcomes for the local community.",
  "https_www_drkieranmullan_org_uk_/https_www_drkieranmullan_org_uk_news_new-bexhill-mental-health-hospital-will-provide-high-quality-care/content_9.html": "I recently visited the construction site of the new mental health hospital in Bexhill which is being built on Mount View Road in north Bexhill, opposite the new Bovis & Vistry homes estate.\nWhen the Bexhill to Hastings Link Road was originally built, the funding for road came on the basis that it would also deliver sites for housing growth and other building space. It is one of those sites which has proved ideal for the new mental health hospital. Located directly between Eastbourne and Hastings, it is an accessible location for patients across East Sussex.\nThe hospital is being built by the Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust - they provide mental health services supporting and treating over 32,000 adults and children each year across East and West Sussex and Brighton and Hove.\nBefore visiting the Bexhill hospital site, I had the pleasure of meeting the senior leadership team of the Trust at their inpatient unit at Eastbourne DGH including their CEO, Jane Padmore, Chair, Paul Duggan, Chief Operating Officer, John Child and Chief Medical Officer, Dr Oliver Dale I was joined by my colleagues Josh Babarinde, MP for Eastbourne and James Cleary, MP for Lewes.\nWe discussed the range of services provided by the Trust and the challenges they face in delivering high quality care and what they are trying to do to improve.\nThe Trust has seen higher demand for their services post-Covid for both adult and child mental health. It has also seen an increase in adult neurodiverse referrals across East Sussex.\nThey face an enormous challenge in responding to the extraordinary increase in referrals for ADHD and autism assessments across East Sussex. The waiting list is more than 7000 patients and this is rising by over 100 per month.\nReferrals to CAMHS (Child and Adult Mental Health Services) for other types of needs have also increased post-Covid. Work to improve referral waits for the core CAMHS community service has reduced the waiting list from 236 in March 2023 to 48 in March 2025 and the average waiting time is now 18 days.\nBut for me, all these challenges raise the question of how we tackle the underlying causes and, if we are seeing such a big increase in demand, how we mainstream and manage things like ADHD and autism in everyday settings at home and school. I can’t imagine the long waits for assessment are going to come down in the short term – not least because it will take time to expand the workforce – so I think we have to consider how parents and families can be supported to manage better in the interim.\nLike all NHS organisations, the Trust faces financial challenges in the medium and longer term. However, the leadership team explained to us that they have transformation and change plans in place to improve access to services, reduce waiting times and deliver improved outcomes for patients across all of their services which is already showing results. However, for some patients, in the shorter term there will still be longer waiting times for diagnosis and treatment.\nAfter our meeting, we were given a tour of the in-patient facilities at Eastbourne hospital. Whilst I could see that everything possible is done to support in-patients at this setting, this type of dormitory ward is not conducive to mental health recovery. This is why this facility will be closed when the new Bexhill hospital is opened.\nFor most people with mental health illness, community care is the best option. It allows people to remain at home, in a familiar environment and with the support of family and friends. However, for around 70-80 people each month, a hospital stay is necessary. For those patients, the new 54-bed mental health hospital in Bexhill has been carefully designed with wellness and recovery at its core. Each wing is made up of separate bedrooms with en-suite bathrooms, so every patient has privacy. Safety and security of patients is evident in every detail of the design. There is lots of outside space, sensory gardens to help aid recovery and welcoming, calm communal space for patients and visitors.\nAs well as benefitting patients, the new hospital in Bexhill will provide highly skilled jobs and training opportunities. These opportunities have already started as the construction partners, Kier, have been providing apprenticeships throughout the building programme.\nThe hospital will be completed towards the end of this year, it will be user-tested by volunteers from the Trust to iron out any issues before opening to patients in early 2026. I am delighted that we have such a well-designed hospital facility in Bexhill which will provide high quality treatment and support to local residents. I look forward to attending the official opening and seeing the completed hospital later this year.",

I don’t think it gets much more real world than working as a Doctor in A&E or volunteering as a policeman and I have done both.

I would work with your local Councillors from any party to get things done – residents come before party politics.\nMy Plan for Battle\n- Support Battle High Street: We are lucky to have a successful high street, but it faces challenges. I would work with the Battle Chamber of Commerce to promote and support businesses and push for us to use new powers to force absent landlords to let out their empty units at reasonable rates.\n-\nChallenge house building in the wrong places: Battle has too many homes built in the wrong places without the right infrastructure. I would support residents and Councillors in their campaigns against this.\n-\nRoad Repairs: Battle has some of the most damaged roads in need of repair in the whole area – even the important heavily trafficked roads like High Street and North Trade Road. The South East is due to receive £2.8 billion roads resurfacing money so we need to make sure we get our fair share.\n-\nBattle Recreation Ground: A new sports pavilion would help keep people active locally and the current facility is badly in need of replacement.

Notably, the Wealth Tax Commission, which has no connection or link to the Government, found in 2020 that, if considering Inheritance Tax, Capital Gains Tax, Stamp Duty, and Stamp Duty Land Tax, the UK is among the top of the G7 countries for wealth taxes as a percentage of total wealth.\nThe UK system is designed to ensure, among other things, that the richest in our society pay their fair share on their wealth and assets, with the tax system taxing wealth across many different economic activities, including acquisition, holding, transfer and disposal of assets and income derived from assets. These tax levers generate substantial revenue; according to the Office for Budget Responsibility, over 2024/25, the Exchequer will accrue Inheritance Tax revenues of £7.5 billion, Capital Gains Tax revenues of £15.2 billion, and property transaction taxes of £14 billion.\nThe UK does get a lot of its tax revenue from the highest earners - the top 10% pay over 60% of the total income tax in the UK, and the top 1% pays 29% of this.\nAny changes to taxation will be announced in future budgets.

This is a green energy and heat producing technology that has been underutilised in the UK, but the industry has been growing.\nDeep geothermal works by heating water via running it underground. Closer to the core of the Earth, the rock is hotter than the surface of the sun, so by drilling even a comparatively small way into the crust, and running water across this rock, we can gain this energy that is otherwise wasted. This is therefore a green and infinite source of heat and energy that I think should be used more in helping us reach our net-zero goals.\nThere are some examples of this being utilised in the UK. The Eden Project in Cornwall has successfully built a geothermal plant, with little disruption to their neighbours, and are now producing energy with the deep heat that they have unlocked. Geothermal plants are surprisingly small too – they can be as small as a shed!\nTo advance this technology, I have written a report, titled ‘Dig Deep’, which was commissioned by Prime Minister Johnson. You can read this below. I have also set up the Deep Geothermal All Party Parliamentary Group, which is a cross-party group of MPs and Lords who agree with my stance on geothermal, and meet regularly with the Government and industry stakeholders to discuss what can be done to get more deep geothermal across the UK!\nIn this page you will be able to read updates in this important campaign.",
  "https_www_drkieranmullan_org_uk_/https_www_drkieranmullan_org_uk_news_looking-forward-2025-and-setting-priorities/content_49.html": "Let me begin by wishing readers a Happy New Year! The start of a New Year is generally a positive time for many and some of you will have made New Year resolutions which I hope are still going strong!\nFor me, the start of a new year is a time to sit down with my team and agree our work priorities and plans for the year ahead. The priorities I set out on being elected remain very important – cleaning up our waters, housing and planning matters, supporting our farmers and protecting the countryside, securing investment in our local hospitals, supporting our GPs and backing our high streets and businesses.\nSix months on from election, as you might expect other issues have also arisen. One being road safety and resilience of our local A-roads. I recently chaired a meeting with National Highways and representatives from Salehurst and Robertsbridge parish to discuss the A21 Road Safety Package. Concerns had been raised by residents and councillors about some of the National Highways proposals which would impact Robertsbridge village. It was a useful meeting and the local knowledge shared was invaluable to the National Highways team who are now reviewing their proposals. Road safety measures which have already been implemented along other sections of the A21 as part of this safety package have generally been well received and data is already showing a reduction in traffic incidents and improvements in driver compliance with speed limits.\nI now want to turn my focus to the A259, specifically the section of road between Little Common and Pevensey roundabout. This stretch of road is regularly congested has seen several serious accidents in recent months. These accidents are dreadful for all those involved. They also cause major delays and gridlock on the limited alternative routes which are primarily small country lanes. I have therefore asked National Highways, who manage this road, for a meeting to discuss the cause of these accidents and what more can be done to improve road safety. I will be working collaboratively with local county and district councillors on this matter as I know that they have also been listening and acting on local concerns and want to see improvements.\nOne of my other new priorities is as a member of the Bexhill Town Board which is moving ahead at pace since the government recently announced that the £20m funding pledged by the last Conservative government is being retained. Timelines on delivery have changed though - funds cannot be spent until April 2026. Delays are frustrating but it means we have more time to think about what we could do with the money and make sure projects can start immediately from that time. I also hope it gives us more time to hear from you as local residents about what you think we could do. I am extremely proud that the outstanding work which the Bexhill Town Board has done so far is being used as an exemplar model for other town boards. Our board Chair, Abi Newbury, is doing a fantastic job in driving the us forward.\nFinally, I’m also really pleased to be supporting the work of the Bexhill Chamber of Commerce and Tourism on their Centenary Fund project. This is a grant funding pot of £41k which was awarded to the Chamber from the last governments Levelling Up Partnership Fund. The Chamber are now accepting applications from businesses, charities and social enterprises for projects that promote, help or support the business community in Bexhill. Thriving local business mean more jobs and opportunities for everybody so I’m excited to see what projects come forward and I would urge the business community to get their applications in as projects need to start by 31st March this year.",
  "https_www_drkieranmullan_org_uk_/https_www_drkieranmullan_org_uk_news_kieran-raises-bexhill-post-office-closure-prime-ministers-questions/content_38.html": "Dr Kieran Mullan MP has highlighted the widespread concern over potential closures of directly run Post Office branches during this week’s Prime Minister’s Questions (PMQs). His intervention follows the announcement by Post Office Ltd that 115 directly run branches are under threat, including the Devonshire Square Post Office in Bexhill.\nDuring the session, Dr Mullan asked the Prime Minister:\n“Members across this House are deeply concerned that the Post Office is considering closing more than 100 branches across our communities. More than 3,000 people have signed a petition opposing the closure of Bexhill Post Office. Does the Prime Minister agree that the Government must ensure that we protect vital post office services for all our constituents?”\nIn response, the Prime Minister assured Dr Mullan that the Government would take this issue seriously, and committed to ensuring that the relevant Minister meets with affected MPs to discuss the potential closures.\nDr Mullan has been leading a local campaign to Save Bexhill Post Office, which includes a petition that has already gathered well over 3,000 signatures, and significant public support. Speaking after the PMQs session, Dr Mullan said:\n\"Post Offices like the one in Devonshire Square provide vital services that smaller branches simply cannot match. The closure of this branch would be a huge loss for residents and businesses in Bexhill and the surrounding rural areas.\"\nDr Mullan added:\n\"Raising this issue at PMQs helps ensure the Government is fully aware of the impact these closures could have. It also provides an opportunity to push for action to safeguard these essential services. I encourage everyone who values Bexhill Post Office to join the campaign and sign the petition to show the strength of local opposition.\"\nTo support the campaign to Save Bexhill Post Office, visit the following link: www.drkieranmullan.org.uk/campaigns/save-bexhill-post-office.\nWatch Kieran's intervention at PMQs, 4th December 2024, below:",

  "https_www_drkieranmullan_org_uk_/https_www_drkieranmullan_org_uk_news_reflections-last-six-months-and-looking-ahead/content_77.html": "Fortnightly Column for the Bexhill and Battle Observer:\nI hope that readers are enjoying the festive season and as this column goes to print on 27 December, I’d like to start by wishing everyone a very Happy New Year.\nAs I write my last column of 2024, it gives me an opportunity to look back over the last 6 months as the MP for the Bexhill and Battle constituency. I feel extremely proud and privileged to be the MP for this beautiful part of East Sussex. I’m heartened by the real sense of community I’ve found across the villages, towns and in those who work hard to make it a great place to live and work. I’m looking forward to the new year when I’ll be continuing to travel around the 200 square miles of the constituency, meeting more local groups, residents and businesses and working hard to support them.\nOver the last couple of months, there has been good news for Bexhill. Firstly, from the Home Office who confirmed they will not be proceeding with an asylum accommodation site at Northeye. I know this proposal caused residents a lot of concern, uncertainty and divide.\nWe also had great news on the future of the Bexhill Town Board, of which I’m a member, when the new government confirmed that they would honour the commitment of the previous Conservative government to provide £20m of funding over 10 years to deliver real improvements for the town and its residents.\nHowever, we also received worrying news about the main Post Office in Bexhill which is under threat of closure. I immediately raised a petition to gauge local opinion and views and the response, now at over 3,500 signatures, demonstrates just how important the Post Office is to residents and businesses in and around Bexhill. Whatever the future for the building, I will be working with local stakeholders to ensure that all the current Post Office services remain in the heart of the town.\nOn more rural matters, I know that residents across the constituency care strongly about the UK’s farming sector and the ability of our country to have long-term food security by producing our own food. Therefore, the Labour government’s budget announcement on the Family Farm Tax came as a big shock to residents and farmers alike. For decades now, farmers passing on their farms to the next generation haven’t had to pay inheritance tax on the value of the farm. This was for a very good reason – whilst the machinery and land of a farm might be worth a lot of money, they have much lower profits than people realise. The average income of a family farm last year was just £43,500 pa for the whole family. If you have to pay a £500,000 inheritance tax bill, then that is a decade without the farm making a profit. Many family farmers will have to sell equipment and land to pay the bill, threatening the viability of the farm.\nI have met with local farmers and the NFU to discuss the devastating impact of this tax on local family farms and I joined with fellow Conservative MPs to protest this decision by the government and to hand in a petition signed by over 200,000 people.\nIf the government doesn’t revoke this decision, the consequence of this tax will be that family farms will broken up to pay inheritance tax bills. Families will leave farming for good, and the impact be huge for the rural economy. We will lose land for food production and our beautiful local landscapes, which need to be worked, will no longer be effectively managed. This tax has not been thought through and in the new year, I will continue to work hard to support our local farmers by fighting and supporting their case.",
  "https_www_drkieranmullan_org_uk_/https_www_drkieranmullan_org_uk_snare-use-uk/content_54.html": "Thank you for contacting me about the use of snares.\nI appreciate your concerns about this issue. The management of predators plays an important role in supporting the recovery of some of our most vulnerable species. There is a proper balance to be struck between protecting both predator and prey species.\nThe Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 states that it is illegal to set in position any trap or snare calculated to cause bodily injury to any wild animal mentioned in section six of the Act. This includes badgers, otters, red squirrels and hedgehogs.\nThe Deer Act 1991 makes it an offence to set in position any trap or snare calculated to cause bodily injury to any deer coming into contact with it, or to use any trap or snare for the purpose of killing, taking or restraining such an animal.\nThe law states that snares set in position must be inspected once a day. The use of a self-locking snare is illegal and the Animal Welfare Act 2006 prohibits causing any unnecessary suffering to any animal.\nWhile laws are in place, I do recognise that there have been cases of snares being used indiscriminately and not being checked, and the code of practice not being followed. When used incorrectly, they can cause significant injuries and suffering to animals. Anyone using snares must act within the law to ensure that their activities do not harm protected species. Penalties are in place when the law is not followed, including an unlimited fine or a custodial sentence. Anyone who suspects that snares have not been used properly should contact the police.\nI understand that the new Government has committed to stop the use of snare traps and I note that the Minister has confirmed that the Government is considering the most effective way to achieve this. I will follow any developments closely.\nKind regards,\nKieran",
  "https_www_drkieranmullan_org_uk_/https_www_drkieranmullan_org_uk_news_newsletter-18/content_45.html": "Welcome to this week's newsletter!\nLast week, campaign group Justice for Victims launched started by the families of victims of horrific crimes, calling for tougher sentences for the worst offenders in our society. I'm honoured to have helped in setting up and launching the group and to have secured them a meeting with the Prime Minister.\nIt was concerning to hear the closure of Santander, our last high street bank in Bexhill. However, I was pleased of the announcement that Bexhill will now receive a banking hub, and I will be working to ensure that free-to-use ATMs remain available in Bexhill.\nSouthern Water have confirmed that those who experienced water loss last year in areas around Brede, Udimore and Westfield will be receiving the compensation they are rightfully entitled to. Check out the article below to see contact details if you feel your compensation does not reflect the period of time without water.\nI had the opportunity to meet with the Hospitals Minister to discuss the urgent need for interim funding to address the growing maintenance backlog at Conquest Hospital, Eastbourne District General Hospital, and Bexhill Hospital. I've seen first-hand the significant challenges our hospitals are already facing, despite the dedication and hard work of NHS staff, and will continue to push for the necessary investment to make that a reality.\nOn Friday I met with the main provider of our mental health services - Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust to discuss mental health services across the region and how we can better support patients and staff. I got to visit the site of the construction of the new 54-bed hospital that will replace the outdated inpatient services currently provided in the Department of Psychiatry at Eastbourne DGH. The new hospital is due to open later this year and will provide individual bedrooms with en-suite bathrooms in a modern and therapeutic environment. The site will also be a centre for training and excellence in mental health care.\nSince the pandemic, there has been an unprecedented rise in demand for mental health services in Sussex and across the country more broadly. We also discussed the unprecedented rise in demand for neurodevelopmental care and assessments. The waiting list for assessment in Sussex sits at around 7000. Whether its diagnosis related to neurodivergence or mental health issues such as anxiety I think it is vital that we better understand the causes of this increase in demand for services of all kinds. Whilst it is an area of ongoing debate I passionately believe that families and communities have got to be a big part of the solution and if it does turn out there has been a long standing underdiagnosis of a large number of people we need to think about how we mainstream living with these challenges.\nI was pleased to meet with Sharon and Gordon Thompson, operators of Abbey Hotel in Battle, at the British Beer and Pub Association Leased and Tenanted Showcase. They expressed their concerns at Labours decision to increase NIC for employers, and to not extend business rate relief. I’m committed to continuing support for local pubs and calling for this Government to reverse their anti-growth policies.\nApril 11th marks World Parkinson’s Day aimed at raising awareness and ensuring that people with Parkinson's feel seen, heard and supported. I had the privilege of meeting with Bexhill-on-Sea Working Age Parkinson’s Group and have since attended the APPG on Parkinson’s to discuss the challenges facing neurological care in the NHS.\nIt is bowel cancer awareness month, so I wanted to share information below on possible symptoms of the disease. Bowel cancer can affect anyone irrespective of age, gender, ethnicity or where you live. The most important thing to know is that the earlier the disease is spotted, the more treatable it’s likely to be – make sure to see your GP if anything feels or seems wrong\nMarch 26th was Purple Day, marking International Day of Epilepsy. It’s a vital opportunity to raise awareness for the 630,000 people in the UK living with epilepsy. Check out the links in the article for more information.\nAs your MP, I wanted to make sure that you knew I can arrange free guided tours of the UK Parliament for residents of my constituency. These 75-minute tours, led by expert guides, provide insight into how Parliament works, its history, and how you can engage in the democratic process. For any constituent who is interested in having a tour of Parliament, see the bottom of this newsletter for contact details.\nAnd lastly, see the bottom of this weeks newsletter for information on local road closures.\nI hope you've had a great weekend!\nThis weeks newsletter:\n- Justice for Victims\n- Santander & Bexhill Post Office\n- Compensation for Water Loss\n- Meeting with Minister for Hospitals\n- Visit to Eastbourne Department of Psychiatry & Combe Valley Hospital\n- British Beer and Pub Association Leased and Tenanted Showcase\n- World Parkinson's Day\n- Bowel Cancer Awareness Month\n- Purple Day - International Day of Epilepsy\n- Book a Parliamentary Tour Now!\n- Local Road Closures\nJustice for Victims\nFor too long our sentencing system has not given enough consideration to what victims, their families and the wider public would consider to be justice. This leaves so many people feeling let down. There are plenty of groups speaking up for what’s best for the perpetrators and asking for more lenient sentences.\nJustice for Victims has been setup by people who have first-hand experience of serious crimes, often losing loved ones, and who want the criminal justice system to focus more on victims and their families and for sentencing policy to deliver proper punishment of the worst offenders.\nThe parents of Sarah Everard (who was abducted whilst walking home, raped and murdered), Katie Brett (whose 16 year old sister was raped and stabbed more than 100 times by her killer), Ayse Hussein (whose cousin was killed by a serial sex offender who stored her body in a freezer), Paula Hudgell OBE (who campaigns on behalf of her adopted son Tony who lost his lower legs as a result of child cruelty),and Becky & Glen Youens (whose 4 year old daughter Violet Grace was killed by a dangerous driver who spent barely more time in prison than their daughter was alive) have come together to say with one voice that it is time for change. It is time for us to start ensuring sentences truly deliver justice for victims and their families.\nIt was a privilege to meet with and help support these incredibly brave and strong people to form a group because they want to do something positive in spite of the horrendous circumstances they have and continue to have to live through. They should be very proud of what they are doing.\nTo find out more about Justice for Victims, check out their website - https://www.justiceforvictims.org.uk/\nSantander & Bexhill Post Office\nLast month, I spoke on BBC Sussex about the disappointing news that Santander has decided to close its Bexhill branch — the last remaining high street bank in the town.\nWhile more people are banking online and closures may be inevitable, I know this decision will be worrying for residents and businesses who rely on in-person services. That’s why it’s essential to ensure Bexhill retains access to vital banking facilities, and I’m pleased to hear about plans to open a banking hub in the town.\nA banking hub would bring multiple banks together in one place, providing essential services for residents and businesses. This would offer a much-needed alternative for those who still rely on face-to-face banking, particularly older residents and small business owners who need regular cash-handling facilities. I will be working closely with stakeholders to ensure this project moves forward as quickly as possible.\nAccess to cash is another key issue. Many people, particularly those on restricted incomes, depend on cash to help manage their finances. With so many bank closures, we’ve lost a significant number of cashpoints, and I will be working to ensure that free-to-use ATMs remain available in Bexhill.\nThis closure also reinforces the importance of keeping our local Post Office open. Many residents rely on it for withdrawing cash, paying bills, and accessing everyday banking services. I will continue to support the Post Office and explore solutions to maintain access to these essential services for our community.\nCompensation for Water Loss\nA number of constituents have been in contact with me about compensation for the water loss experienced in the areas around Hastings – specifically Brede, Westfield and Udimore.\nInitially there were reports that these areas may not be included in the compensation being offered by Southern Water, therefore, I wrote to them asking for a confirmation that residents affected would receive the compensation they should reasonably expect.\nI’m pleased to share that Southern Water have confirmed that those residents affected will be receiving compensation. Further they have offered contact details for their Customer Service Team for customers who feel the compensation does not reflect the time they were impacted for – Tel: 0330 303 0277; or Email: [email protected].\nMake sure to get in contact if you feel that your compensation is not representative.\nMeeting with Minister for Hospitals\nThis week, I had the opportunity to meet with the Hospitals Minister to discuss the urgent need for interim funding to address the growing maintenance backlog at Conquest Hospital, Eastbourne District General Hospital, and Bexhill Hospital.\nThe Labour Government’s recent decision to delay plans to rebuild our local hospitals means that the benefits of the New Hospital Programme won’t be delivered until at least 2039. In the meantime, East Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust is facing a staggering £460 million maintenance backlog—one of the largest in the country.\nDuring my visit to Bexhill Hospital, I saw first-hand the significant challenges our hospitals are already facing, despite the dedication and hard work of NHS staff. Issues such as leaking roofs, poor ventilation, and power outages are putting increasing pressure on our healthcare facilities.\nI am committed to securing the vital additional funding needed to tackle these urgent issues while we await the long-term rebuild plans. Our communities deserve safe, well-maintained hospitals, and I will continue to push for the necessary investment to make that a reality.\nVisit to Eastbourne Department of Psychiatry & Combe Valley Hospital\nOn Friday I met with the main provider of our mental health services - Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust to discuss mental health services across the region and how we can better support patients and staff.\nSince the pandemic, there has been an unprecedented rise in demand for mental health services in Sussex and across the country more broadly. The Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust has more than 600 beds across the region, but demand continues to grow, and the way in which we support mental health patients has evolved.\nWe also discussed the rise in demand for neurodevelopmental care and assessments. The waiting list for assessment in Sussex sits at around 7000, and every month 100 people join the waiting list. Addressing this waiting list requires a wider workforce of clinical psychologists, which is why I have agreed to write to the Chancellor to ask what plans the Treasury have to fund the training of more clinical psychologists.\nWhether its diagnosis related to neurodivergence or mental health issues such as anxiety I think it is vital that we better understand the causes of this increase in demand for services of all kinds. Whilst it is an area of ongoing debate I passionately believe that families and communities have got to be a big part of the solution and if it does turn out there has been a long standing underdiagnosis of a large number of people we need to think about how we mainstream living with these challenges.\nDuring my visit to the Department of Psychiatry at Eastbourne DGH, I saw first-hand the dedication and hard work of staff in providing compassionate care. However, it was also clear that the current facilities present challenges in meeting the needs of modern mental health treatment.\nEnsuring patients have access to a supportive, therapeutic environment is vital and it was great to see progress at the site of the new mental health hospital in North Bexhill.\nThis new 54-bed hospital will replace the outdated inpatient services currently provided in the Department of Psychiatry at Eastbourne DGH. The new hospital is due to open later this year and will provide individual bedrooms with en-suite bathrooms in a modern and therapeutic environment. The site will also be a centre for training and excellence in mental health care.\nI was pleased to hear that the hospital has been carefully designed with the patient's needs at its core. The construction project by Kier has created local employment opportunities and apprenticeships and the new hospital will provide skilled employment and training opportunities.\nBritish Beer & Pub Association Leased and Tenanted Showcase\nWe are lucky in our constituency to have such a vibrant hospitality sector, with amazing vineyards and lovely pubs to enjoy!\nThis week, I was pleased to meet with Sharon and Gordon Thompson at the British Beer and Pub Association Leased and Tenanted Showcase. Sharon and Gordon operate Abbey Hotel in Battle and hold the belief that pubs are the beating heart of our high street, helping to increase footfall and keeping out rural towns active and vibrant.\nHowever, they expressed their concerns to me that Labour’s decision to increase National Insurance Contributions for employers, and also to not extend business rates relief, was having a real impact on their ability to operate locally and risked putting their future as licensees at risk.\nI have no doubt that these sentiments will be shared by licensees across the entire country, as publicans struggle to compete against rising costs, without the necessary support that the last Conservative Government offered.\nI’m committed to continuing support for local pubs and calling for this Government to reverse their anti-growth policies. I would also like to thank Sharon and Gordon for their kind invitation to one of their pubs - I hope to make my way over soon!\nWorld Parkinson's Day\nApril 11th marks World Parkinson's Day aimed at raising awareness and ensuring that people with Parkinson's feel seen, heard and supported.\nParkinson's is a complex brain condition that gets worse over times. It is currently the fastest growing neurological condition in the world, affecting 153,000 people in the UK.\nTo mark World Parkinson’s Day this year, Parkinson's UK is encouraging everyone to show their support and Make It Blue, from lighting up buildings to hosting blue bake sales to wearing blue for a day. However people choose to get involved, they will be helping to raise awareness of Parkinson’s, one blue hue at a time.\nLate last year, I had the privilege of meeting with the Bexhill-on-Sea Working Age Parkinson’s Group and hearing their personal experiences was extremely informative. Following this, I attended the APPG on Parkinson’s meeting to discuss the challenges facing neurological care in the NHS.\nKnowing how important support is for those constituents suffering with Parkinson's, I agreed to work with the group on ways we can ensure there are more staff of the right kind to better look after the needs of Parkinson's patients.\nFor information on the different forms of support available, or for more information on World Parkinson's Day, check out Parkinson's UK website linked above.\nBowel Cancer Awareness Month\nBowel cancer can affect anyone, whatever your age, gender, ethnicity, or where you live. The most important thing to know is that the earlier the disease is spotted, the more treatable it’s likely to be.\nThat’s why this Bowel Cancer Awareness Month I'm supporting Bowel Cancer UK's Pass It On campaign.\nThey’re asking everyone to share information about bowel cancer because when you #PassItOn you could help someone else notice when something isn’t right.\nLearn more about the possible symptoms of the disease: https://www.bowelcanceruk.org.uk/about-bowel-cancer/symptoms/\nYou can find out more about the campaign through Bowel Cancer UK's website linked above.\nPurple Day - International Day of Epilepsy\nMarch 26th was #PurpleDay, and I’m proud to support this year’s theme, #StandUpToSeizures.

I know this is a really important issue for a number of constituents and I will continue to keep pushing the Government on this issue.\nOn Friday I was pleased to attend Bexhill's Job and Apprenticeship Fair at the De La Warr Pavilion. It was a great opportunity to meet all the local businesses and charities. This day could not happen without the hard work of so many people, so a big thank you to everyone who helped make it happen!\nLast week I had the honour to taking part in Frewen College’s opening ceremony for their new 6th Form Centre. This is a specialist dyslexia college, so is a great asset to have in our community. It was clear from conversations with students that they love being at the school.\nI had the pleasure of visiting the Rother Valley Railway reconstruction project, where I heard about the progress towards re-connecting Robertsbridge Station to the heritage Kent and East Sussex Railway. This is a really exciting project, and I look forward to its completion.\nYesterday marked the start of the Great British Spring Clean! I joined Battle Town Council for their litter big community litter pick to mark the occasion!\nNext week is Debt Awareness Week, aimed at raising awareness about the support available to people struggling with debt. I know that there are certain stigmas associated with debt which mean that people struggle in silence. It is so important if you are struggling financially, that you seek help and speak with a debt advice service.\nAnd lastly, a new addition to the newsletter, I have provided a listing of all the roadworks ongoing (as of when this was released). Do make sure to take a look to save time waiting in an unexpected queue.\nHave a great weekend.\nThis week's newsletter:\n- Conservative Party Policy Renewal Programme\n- English Tourism Week!\n- Crowhurst CofE Primary School Visit Parliament\n- Brain Tumour Awareness Month\n- Bexhill Jobs and Apprenticeships Fair\n- Opening of Frewen College's New 6th Form Centre\n- Rother Valley Railway\n- Great British Spring Clean\n- Debt Awareness Week\n- Local Road Closures\nConservative Party Policy Renewal Programme\nConservative voters have been in touch with me over the past couple of months, querying the direction the party will take – what policies will be focused on moving forward.\nWell, this week the Party kicked off a new chapter as Kemi announced the Conservative Party’s Policy Renewal Programme.\nYou can read/watch her speech here:\nhttps://www.conservatives.com/news/watch-live-kemi-launches-the-policy-renewal-programme\nKemi was elected as leader of the Party to tell some hard truths about the future. On Tuesday, she focused on our net zero by 2050 target, which she explained under current plans is nearly impossible without economically bankrupting ourselves or hiking up costs hugely for families. Most importantly-with other countries like China building new coal power plants and their projected contribution being much greater than ours, there is no point in us going further and further until other countries catch up. We have made huge reductions already-the fastest in the G7.\nCurrently, Labour do not have a plausible plan for net zero that also supports our energy security, without costing everyday workers serious money. We must do better than this and under new leadership, Kemi has been clear that every policy must be backed by a plan.\nShe has now asked her team to develop a credible achievable approach to net zero - one that takes into account what other countries are doing and the difference we can make.\nThere will be lots more to announce as the Policy Renewal Programme continues, and I look forward to discussing these more in the future.\nEnglish Tourism Week!\nIf you have been following my social media, you will have seen that each day I have been posting different local attractions here in our constituency to celebrate English Tourism Week (14th – 23rd March).\nI have said it a few times before, but we truly are so lucky to have an incredibly rich cultural and history across all corners of the constituency. From Bodiam Castle to Bexhill Museum; Bateman’s in Burwash to the array of incredible vineyards.\nLocal attractions and businesses are clear that whilst outside tourism is of course a massive boost, local residents play a vital role as contributors.\nSo, the next time you are thinking of heading further from home for a day out, why not take a look at something more local – you might just find something that you haven’t yet visited!\nBelow are some of the places that I’ve visited:\n- Bodiam Castle\n- Bexhill Museum\n- Bateman’s (National Trust)\n- Local Vineyards – Oastbrook Estate & Oxney Organic Estate\n- Bodiam Boating Station and the Kent and East Sussex Railway\n- De La Warr Pavilion\n- Battle Abbey & Battlefield\n- Countryside, Gardens and Beaches – Combe Valley Countryside or 1066 website for ideas of events throughout the year\n- Bexhill 100 Car Show\n- Mint House - Events by Friends of the Mint House\nCrowhurst CofE Primary School Visit Parliament\nThis week, I had the pleasure of visiting Crowhurst CofE Primary School and meeting its fantastic pupils.\nOne of the best parts of my job as your MP is engaging with young people and hearing their thoughts on politics. It’s always a privilege to share why I chose to enter public service, explain how Parliament works, and answer their insightful questions. Their curiosity and enthusiasm remind me why it’s so important to encourage the next generation to take an interest in democracy and their communities.\nI want to thank the staff and students for taking the time to visit Parliament - I look forward to visiting soon!\nBrain Tumour Awareness Month\nMarch is #BrainTumourAwarenessMonth and I’ve joined MPs from across the political spectrum in signing a letter to the Health Minister to ensure that those affected by brain tumours are not left behind in the Governments upcoming 10-Year Health and Cancer Plans.\nI have previously met with the Brain Tumour Charity to discuss concerns over targets for diagnosis, which fall sort of improvement for brain cancer patients because it nearly always presents much later.\nI'm pleased to continue pushing the Government on this important issue.\nBexhill Job and Apprenticeship Fair\nThis Friday I attended the Bexhill Job and Apprenticeship Fair at the De La Warr Pavilion.\nIt was a great chance to meet so many of the local charities and businesses who are looking to take on new employees.\nAs part of the event, the Bexhill Chamber of Commerce offered a CV writing service and the De La Warr organised for local groups to put on workshops to help job seekers expand their skill set.\nThank you so much to all of the people who have worked so hard to make this day happen. And a congratulations on this being the 10 year anniversary of the event!\nI will look forward to attending next year.\nOpening of Frewen College's New 6th Form Centre\nIt was a great pleasure to visit Frewen College in Northiam today to take part in the ceremony to officially open their new 6th Form Centre. This specialist dyslexia college supports students from across a wide area to achieve their full potential.\nIt was great to meet Headmaster, Mark Loveday and his team of dedicated and hardworking staff as well as having the opportunity to talk to students who love being at the school.\nRother Valley Railway\nIt was a great pleasure to visit the team leading the Rother Valley Railway reconstruction project at Robertsbridge Station to hear more about the progress towards re-connecting Robertsbridge Station to the heritage Kent and East Sussex Railway which runs between Bodiam and Tenterden.\nThis project will allow visitors from stations along the London to Hastings mainline service to visit the heritage line and the tourism attractions, villages and towns along the Rother Valley route by public transport. The project is expected to deliver substantial economic benefits to the area and is supported by Rother District Council.\nAt Robertsbridge, a new station ticket hall and visitor centre was well under way and there are further plans for a railway museum.\nGreat British Spring Clean\nIt was great to join residents and councillors for the Battle Town Council Great British Spring Clean. I got an update on our local recycling service as well! Did you know in our area you can recycle small electrical items from home like irons, toasters, radios, hairdryers and phones with your recycling or rubbish collection service? Items must be small enough to fit in a plastic carrier bag, and the bag placed on top of the recycling or rubbish bin on the usual day of collection. Batteries (if removable) must be placed in a separate bag again on top of the bin.\nDebt Awareness Week\nDebt can happen to anyone and can come because of all sorts of things – whether it is through higher bills; unexpected loss of employment; or any number of other factors.\nTo support people in debt, StepChange is running Debt Awareness Week (24th – 30th March), aimed at raising awareness about the support available to people struggling with debt, empowering them to take control of their financial situation.\nDebt can be an incredibly difficult thing to talk about, as sadly many people associate it with certain stigmas. Despite being common, many people struggle on without speaking to anyone due to feelings of shame or a fear of judgement.\nIt is so important that those who are struggling financially reach out for assistance. There are lots of charities, such as StepChange or National Debtline who can offer free debt advice.\nIf you are in debt, and would like to talk to someone about it, get in touch with a debt charity like StepChange, and speak to a professional about getting your finances back on track.\nLocal Road Closures (please note this information is provided by third parties):\nBattle\n- Crazy Lane – 24 Feb 10:23 - 2 May 23:59\nHastings\n- Wartling Road – 25 Mar - 28 Mar\n- Stonestile Lane – Reopens 21 Mar 23:59\nHailsham\n- Hammer Hill – 10 Mar 08:12 - 4 Apr 23:59\nBexhill\n- Potmans Lane – 31 Mar closed 09:30 - 15:30\n- London Road – 24 Mar - 4 Apr\n- Maberley Road – Closed 31 Mar\n- Sandhurst Lane – 31 Mar - 2 Apr\nRye & Surrounding Areas\n- Sheepstreet Lane – 17 Mar - 4 Apr\n- Beckley Road – 1 Apr closed 09:30 - 15:30\n- Foul Mile – 25 Mar\nTicehurst\n- Ticehurst Road – 5 Mar - 4 Apr\n- Vineyard Lane – 1 Apr - 3 Apr\nHawkhurst\n- Hawkhurst Road – 31 Mar 19:00 - 4 Apr 06:00\n- Cranbrook Road – 31 Mar - 6 May\nHeathfield & Surrounding Areas\n- Heathfield Road – 31 Mar - 2 Apr\n- Blackdown Lane – 24 Mar - 4 Apr\nWestfield\n- Moat Lane – 3 Apr\nRobertsbridge\n- Post Office Road – 31 Mar - 30 Jun\n- Cackle Street – 1 Apr - 17 Apr\nUckfield\n- Junction Road – 2 Sep 2024 - 7 Jun 2025\nCrowborough\n- Whitworth Road – 2 Sep 2024 - 7 Jun 2025\n- Quarry Hill (Long-term closure)\n- Quarry Hill – 31 Jan 07:00 - 31 Mar 23:59",
  "https_www_drkieranmullan_org_uk_/https_www_drkieranmullan_org_uk_news_kieran-urges-health-secretary-reconsider-cross-party-talks-hospital-upgrades/content_56.html": "When I was elected, one of my first actions was to write to the Health Secretary, Wes Streeting, to raise investment in our local hospitals.\nI am deeply disappointed that the Health Secretary has refused a cross-party meeting regarding the hospital building programme. This is an issue that transcends party politics, and it is crucial that all voices are heard when discussing the future of our healthcare infrastructure.\nAs many will have been aware, under the previous government's New Hospital Programme, Eastbourne General District Hospital and Conquest Hospital had been earmarked for significant investment. Last week, I attended a briefing with the East Sussex Hospital Trust Chief Executive, and it was encouraging to hear about the progress of the business plan and the support they've received thus far. However, the new labour government has cast doubt around whether this will be delivered, committing to a review of the hospital programme.\nI will continue to urge the government to reconsider and I hope they can agree to a meeting in the near future.",
  "https_www_drkieranmullan_org_uk_/https_www_drkieranmullan_org_uk_campaigns_transport-survey-fixing-our-roads/content_51.html": "It may seem an impossible task but after speaking to constituents over the last few weeks has confirmed what I expected to be the case from my own experience. The state of our local roads is a major issue for pretty much everyone!\nI want to hit the ground running in pushing for repairs where they are needed most! Though I appreciate the list will be long - we have to start somewhere.\nTell me your nightmare pot holes and road surfaces desperately in need of repair!\nThe South East is due to receive £2.8 billion roads resurfacing money so we need to make sure we get our fair share. East Sussex County Council was successful in receiving £41.4 million for a Bus Service Improvement Plan - but what do you want from our local bus services?\nI am keen to hear your thoughts on all local transport issues including road, rail and bus services as well as road safety. This will help me draw up a plan for what I want to help get done locally.\nYou can skip the sections on transport modes you don't use.",
  "https_www_drkieranmullan_org_uk_/https_www_drkieranmullan_org_uk_news_newsletter-15/content_72.html": "Welcome to this week's newsletter\nAs you will see from this week’s newsletter, I have been very busy in both the constituency and in parliament.\nFirst off – an update on the Post Office. Ahead of a meeting with Post Office Ltd I spoke on BBC Sussex where I heard a lot of resident’s concerns about the potential closure of the Devonshire Square branch. This just reaffirms how important the Post Office to our community.\nThe meeting itself was disappointing, as representatives could not answer some very basic questions for a decision which will be made so soon! They have promised further information at the end of this week and further discussions with MPs.\nIn the Chamber I challenged the Deputy PM on the Government’s rural funding settlement, which gives around 40% less spending power per head to rural areas compared with urban ones. This does nothing to fix the clear disparity in funding to rural areas, further confirming that Labour will continue to put big cities first.\nAn exiting rite of passage, I took part in Question Time last week. It was a good debate on important local issues, including housing and infrastructure. A real concern of mine is the increase in housing targets for rural areas, with a decrease in urban areas. With the he reduction in spending power from the rural funding settlement, it only further supports that Labour puts cities first.\nI was pleased to meet with Eurostar CEO to discuss the return of Eurostar to Ashford International. I know that this is a popular idea locally, as the Ashford stop offered East Sussex easier access to the continent. The past few years have seen only excuses for the lack of service, but what we need to a clear roadmap for reopening, which I will continue to push for.\nIn the Chamber I raised concerns of so many local businesses and employers over this Government’s job tax through NI contributions. With the OBRs forecast that this will damage the very growth our country desperately needs, I asked the Chief Secretary whether they agreed.\nI was delighted to receive a letter from the King thanking me for sending him the Christmas Card designed by Barnaby from Bodiam CE Primary School. Congratulations once more Barnaby!\nIn the constituency, I visited the new Community Diagnostic Centre facility, and Bexhill Hospital. It is great to see how productive the new Diagnostic centre which has been - a huge thank you to the tireless efforts of all staff.\nDuring my visit to the Bexhill Hospital, I was told about some of the practical challenges that come with delivering care in an aging hospital, despite this staff do an amazing job of creating a supportive and relaxing environment for patients. I will continue working with our local Healthcare Trust to deliver first class healthcare to patients in Bexhill & Battle.\nFocused on supporting healthcare locally, I met with Cllr Eleanor Kirby Green, and Mary Barnes, to discuss concerns over the scheduled closure of Ticehurst GP Surgery. Following my meeting I’m pleased to share that Ticehurst Surgery will remain open until at least May 2027! This is a positive step forward, but there’s still work to do. I’ll continue to monitor this issue and make sure our community gets the healthcare it needs.\nI was pleased for the opportunity to attend All Saints Church coffee morning a couple of weekends back. A great team of volunteers to help with all the great activities they host. Please check out their website link for more information.\nA huge congratulations to Little Gate Farm, who were awarded the Tesco’s Golden Grant! This is a scheme which awards the voted-for project with a one-off £5000 grant, based on a customer receiving a golden token – there is only 1 of these found per 500 shops. Once again, a big congratulations to Little Gate in securing this generous grant and thank you to the individual who chose them as their charity to receive it.\nI attended the Gingerbread Parliamentary reception, where I heard about the damage caused to children when absent parents do not make their child maintenance payments. Whilst the CMS are tasked with cracking down on cases of parents who fail to make these payments, it is clear their current approach is still not working. Too many children are being let down by the CMS.\nYou may have heard of Asda’s Cashpot for Schools campaign, which was fronted by Joe Wicks to raise money for schools. I was pleased to see that £4,847 was raised by shoppers in Bexhill & Battle for our local schools, which will help schools to buy extra books, tech and sports equipment. Well-done everyone!\nI was fortunate last week to visit St Mary’s Special School and College in Bexhill to take part in their whole school assembly and receive a tour from their Head Boy and Head Girl. A huge thank you to the staff and students for having me! I look forward to supporting the school in any way I can in the future.\nLindsay from Bexhill Community Supporters, met with me to discuss their plans to transform Broad Oak Park into a hub for conservation, environmental education, and green job training. I share their frustration and will do what I can to support them in getting this important initiative off the ground.\nAnd lastly, I took time to visit Egerton Park Bowls Club to chat to some of their members about the vital role the club plays in our local community. It was great to hear about how valued the club is, and about the clubs plans to install a new state-of-the-art solar grid. I fully support the clubs ambitions to make their building more sustainable and ensure it remains part of the community for decades to come.\nThat’s it for this newsletter. Have a great weekend!\nUpdate on Bexhill Post Office\nLast week, I spoke on BBC Sussex about the concerns many constituents have regarding the potential closure of the Post Office in Bexhill. Over 4,000 people have signed the petition so far. If you haven’t, please do so here: Save Bexhill Post Office Petition.\nThe main worry is that small businesses could face limits on cash deposits. In a town with many older residents who rely on cash, the Post Office is vital. Many older people also depend on it for pension services. With so many banks closing, this proposed closure is the wrong decision for Bexhill.\nThe following day, other MPs and I met Post Office Ltd representatives to discuss the potential closure of the last Direct Managed Branches (DMB) in the UK, including the Post Office in Bexhill. This meeting included Nigel Railton, Interim Chair of Post Office Ltd, and Neil Brocklehurst, acting CEO.\nI was very disappointed with the meeting, as Post Office representatives didn’t even know what criteria they’d use to make their decision, even though a decision is expected in March.\nThey were also unaware of the challenges local businesses face with cash deposit services at sub-post offices compared to DMB's, one of my main concerns.\nMPs made it clear this wasn’t acceptable for us or our constituents. Post Office Ltd has promised another update next week, and I will work with other MPs to robustly hold them to account.\nRural Funding Settlement\nI took the concerns of rural communities to Parliament and challenged the Deputy Prime Minister on the Labour Government's rural funding settlement.\nFirst they cut the Rural Services Delivery Grant, which gave £110m to 94 rural authorities last year to assist in the running of vital public services.\nAnd now Labour's provisional funding settlement gives around 40% less spending power per head to rural areas compared to urban areas. Analysis from the Rural Services Network found that urban areas are getting more government funding, while rural funding has flatlined. Yet, both are expected to provide the same services.\nThere’s a lot of talk about reorganisation, but it does nothing to fix this deep unfairness in funding. Yet again, Labour is showing they don’t understand rural areas—putting big cities first time and time again.\nQuestion Time!\nI was a panellist on Question Time - a rite of passage for MPs! It was good to debate important local issues, including concerns around housing and infrastructure.\nI used my experience as your MP and the concerns raised to inform my views and what I said. We didn't fix the issue of matching housing to more infrastructure and expanded public services in Government. We now have to take the time to come up with new solutions.\nBut I'm very worried that in the meantime Labour have put our housing targets even higher whilst lowering them for big cities like London.\nYou can watch the whole show on BBC iPlayer: https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m0027f39/question-time-2025-30012025\nPushing for Eurostar's Return to Ashford International\nRecently, I met with Eurostar’s CEO, Gwendoline Cazenave, alongside other MPs to push for the return of Eurostar services to Ashford International.\nBefore COVID-19, Ashford was a key stop, offering direct trains to Paris, Brussels, Disneyland Paris, and seasonal routes to the Alps and South of France. It was a vital link for Kent, East Sussex, and beyond—providing a convenient alternative to traveling into London.\nEurostar suspended Ashford services in March 2020 and has repeatedly delayed their return, citing financial challenges, fleet and station capacity, upcoming border system changes, and staff shortages as reasons for the continued closure.\nBut what we need is a clear roadmap for reopening, not more delays. I joined MPs in urging Eurostar to set out exactly what is required to restart services and how MPs, local partners, and the Government can help make it happen.\nAshford International was built with taxpayer investment and served Eurostar passengers well for years. Eurostar must be transparent about what it would take to return services and work with us to find a way forward.\nTaking Your Concerns to Parliament\nYou may have seen I recently visited Saxonwood Care Home and St Michael's Hospice. Alongside all the positive things we talked about I also heard about their worries about the upcoming jobs tax and the impact it will have on their finances. These concerns are shared by Bexhill Chamber of Commerce, who fear the impact this will have on our high streets.\nIn Parliament, I took these concerns directly to the Chief Secretary, asking if they agree with the OBR's forecast that this jobs tax will harm, rather than help, growth. I’ll continue to bring the voices of our community to Westminster and fight for policies that support our local businesses and workforce.\nChristmas Card - Response From The King\nDelighted to have received a letter from Buckingham Palace, thanking me for sending him the Christmas card designed by Barnaby from Bodiam CE Primary School.\nCongratulations to Barnaby again for his wonderful submission!\nBexhill Hospital Visit\nI'm very grateful to East Sussex Healthcare Trust for a tour of Bexhill Community Diagnostic Centre and Bexhill hospital last week.\nOur new Community Diagnostic Centre in Bexhill is hugely productive, thanks to the tireless efforts of the staff, who have made it such a successful venture. Residents will know that the site of the diagnostic centre use to be a car showroom, which is fantastic example of innovation in our NHS.\nBexhill hospital itself was built in 1933, off the back of one of the deepest recessions in history, and it was a pleasure to meet some of the staff who keep it running to this day. One of those is their Site Manager, Lesley, who gave me a tour of their eye surgery centre, including their new Dowling Unit, named after the Bexhill Hospital League of friends chairman, John Dowling, who helped to secure funding for it.\nI got to join members of the league of friends, John and Bridget, for a coffee and to thank them for all the incredible work they do for our local hospitals. The League of Friends is a community group which raises funds that to pay for vital hospital upgrades and maintenance. In the past decade, they have raised nearly £3 million which has helped to buy everything from chairs for waiting rooms, to MRI scanners.\nI was also given a tour of the Irvine Unit at Bexhill hospital, where their teams teams work alongside patients and their loved ones to provide personalised rehabilitation to increase their independence and enhance quality of life. Here, I was told about some of the practical challenges that come with delivering care in an aging hospital, despite this staff do an amazing job of creating a supportive and relaxing environment for patients.\nI also had the opportunity to discuss the implications of the Labour governments recent decision to delay the rebuild of hospitals across East Sussex, namely Bexhill hospital, and the impact this will have on patients. Under the New Hospitals Programme, these rebuild were scheduled to be delivered by 2030, but the earliest we can expect to seen them is now 2039.With a maintenance backlog of £410 million, which includes a £160 million Critical Infrastructure bill, they were clear that the government needs to allocate more funding in the meantime while we wait for the new hospital rebuilds to start.\nHaving been an NHS doctor for years, Hospitals and healthcare will always be one of my key priorities, and I will be working with East Sussex Healthcare Trust to ensure they get the funding they need to continue to deliver first class healthcare to patients in Bexhill and Battle.\nTicehurst Surgery Update\nI recently met with Cllrs Eleanor Kirby Green and Mary Barnes who raised concerns on behalf of residents about the scheduled closure of Ticehurst surgery, which was planned for spring 2025.\nI shared their concerns about the impact this will have on local residents with NHS Sussex, and I know others did the same. After this, I’m pleased to share that Ticehurst Surgery will remain open until at least May 2027!\nThis gives us much-needed time to ensure that local healthcare services are properly planned for the future.\nDuring this period, NHS Sussex and the GP practice will be reviewing how best to provide services in our area, and I will be pressing them to give consideration to our elderly population in Ticehurst, who rely on having locally accessible GP services.\nIn the coming weeks, stakeholders—including parish, district, and county councillors—will be meeting to discuss next steps and I’ve requested to attend to ensure your concerns are heard loud and clear. Also, a wider community engagement event is planned for 6th March at Ticehurst Village Hall from 2-7pm.\nThis is a positive step forward, but there’s still work to do. I’ll continue to monitor this issue and make sure our community gets the healthcare it needs.\nAll Saints Church Coffee Morning\nIt was great to drop in on the coffee morning at All Saints Church, Sidley. I met with Fr Ian Edgar and the team of volunteers and got to enjoy a delicious slice of homemade Bakewell tart and got lucky on the tombola!\nIt was good to hear about the other activities that take place there like the baby and toddler group and girls youth group. Thanks for having me!\nGolden Grant for Little Gate Farm\nI met with Mary, member of Little Gate’s team, at Tesco’s parliamentary reception to celebrate charities who have received a Golden Grant. Little Gate is a charitable organisation I’ve spoken about previously, which was born out of a vision to enrich the lives of people with learning difficulties and autism.\nTo support those adults with learning difficulties who want to learn the skills needed for paid employment, Little Gate offers Supported Training, Supported Apprenticeship and Supported Employment opportunities for adults.\nIn 2024, 5 projects across the Bexhill and Battle constituency received a Tesco Stronger Starts grant. However, Little Gate Farm were the lucky recipients of a Golden Grant, which awards the voted-for project with a one-off £5000 grant.\nMary was pleased to tell me about the £5000 grant they received as part of Tesco’s Golden Grant scheme. For those unaware, Tesco offers customers a token after each shop which can then be awarded to one of a selection of charities within the local area of that shop.\nThe golden token is a very special one of these, with only 1 of these found per 500 shops.\nSo, a big congratulations to Little Gate in securing this generous grant and thank you to the individual who chose them as their charity to receive it.\nGingerbread Parliamentary Reception\nI find it disgraceful that some absent parents fail to financially support their children, shifting all the responsibility to their ex-partner and taxpayers.\nResearch by York university has found that if child maintenance payments were secured from absent parents, it would lift 60% of children living in single-parent households that currently are not receiving them out of poverty. Proof that delinquent parents are literally choosing to keep their children in poverty. This is reprehensible.\nThere is a body tasked with cracking down on cases where parents fail to pay their maintenance. It is called the Child Maintenance Service. Unfortunately, the current approach they are taking is simply not delivering results.\nAccording to Gingerbread, maintenance arrears under the CMS are forecast to hit £1 billion by March 2031. We know the money is there and can be collected, but the CMS fails to enforce payment time and again. Behind this figure lie personal stories like that of Rachel and her daughter Abi. Speaking at the reception, Rachel spoke of how her ex-partner had not once paid a full year of maintenance since their split. Whilst claiming he could not afford to pay for his children, he was simultaneously posting pictures online of his luxury holidays and vanity purchases.\nToo many children are being let down by the CMS. 61% of single parents contacting the CMS said staff there are ‘reluctant’ to use their enforcement powers. It is clear this unfairness cannot continue. It is unfair on the children, on single parents caring for them and on taxpayers who are left picking up the bill for irresponsible, absent parents.\nAt Gingerbread’s #FixtheCMS reception I spoke with their head of policy Sarah Lambert, and discussed the need to strengthen the CMS’ enforcement powers. I shared my plans to bring stronger action against parents failing to pay, such as using home curfew’s and tagging to compel them to take responsibility and pay.\nIf you or someone you know is a single parent who is struggling, get in contact with Gingerbread who can help you with expert and tailored advice on any aspect of single parenting. Their website can be found here: https://www.gingerbread.org.uk/\nAsda Cashpot for Schools\nYou might have heard of Asda’s Cashpot for Schools campaign, fronted by Joe Wicks and setting out to raise money for schools!\nIt was a pleasure to attend their Parliamentary reception on Tuesday, celebrating the £4,847 raised by shoppers in Bexhill and Battle for our local schools. This money will help schools buy extra books, tech and sports equipment.\nShoppers were able to nominate a local school for Asda to donate a portion of their shopping bill to. Impressively, as we don’t have an Asda locally, all this money has been raised solely from online shopping!\nI’d like to thank our Bexhill and Battle shoppers for their contributions and ASDA for running this great campaign!\nThe schools who will benefit can be found below:\n- All Saints Church of England Primary School, Bexhill\n- Battle and Langton Church of England Primary School\n- Beckley Church of England Primary School\n- Bodiam Church of England Primary School\n- Brede Primary School\n- Burwash CofE School\n- Catsfield Church of England Primary School\n- Chantry Community Primary School\n- Crowhurst CofE Primary School\n- Dallington Church of England Primary School\n- Etchingham Church of England Primary School\n- Glenleigh Park Primary Academy\n- Glyne Gap School\n- Herstmonceux Church of England Primary School\n- Hurst Green Church of England Primary School and Nursery\n- King Offa Primary Academy\n- Little Common School\n- Netherfield CofE Primary School\n- Ninfield Church of England Primary School\n- Northiam Church of England Primary School and Nursery\n- Pebsham Primary Academy\n- Pevensey and Westham CofE Primary School\n- Salehurst Church of England Primary School\n- Sedlescombe Church of England Primary School\n- St Mary Magdalene Catholic Primary School\n- St Mary's School and 6th Form College\n- St Peter and St Paul CofE Primary School\n- Staplecross Methodist Primary School\n- Stonegate Church of England Primary School\n- Ticehurst and Flimwell Church of England Primary School\n- Westfield School\nVisit to St Mary's Special School\nRecently, I was fortunate to visit St Mary's Special School and College in Bexhill to take part in their whole school assembly and receive a tour from their Head Boy and Head Girl.\nI was truly inspired by the warm welcome from students and staff alike. The assembly was a wonderful celebration of the school’s achievements, and it was fantastic to see the enthusiasm and dedication of everyone involved.\nDuring the tour, the Head Boy and Head Girl proudly showcased the school’s incredible facilities, highlighting the supportive and nurturing environment that enables students to thrive. From specialist classrooms to creative learning spaces, it was clear that St Mary’s is a place where every young person is valued and encouraged to reach their full potential.\nA huge thank you to the staff and students for having me! I look forward to supporting the school in any way I can in the future.\nBexhill Community Supporters Vision for Broad Oak Park\nI met with Lindsay from Bexhill Community Supporters to discuss their plans to transform Broad Oak Park into a hub for conservation, environmental education, and green job training.\nDespite years of planning, public consultations, and securing early funding, progress has stalled. With support from the Heritage Lottery Fund, Bexhill Environmental Group, and Action in Rural Sussex, this project has huge potential—but it needs action.\nI share their frustration and will do what I can to support them in getting this important initiative off the ground.\nVisit to Egerton Park Bowls Club\nLast week I got to visit Egerton Park Bowls Club and chat to some of their members about the vital role the club plays in our local community.\nMembers, Tink and Allison, talked about how the bowls club plays such positive role in keeping people healthy and social, they were kind enough to show me the ropes and give me an introduction to bowls—a great experience!\nI also got to talk to their chairman, Denis, about the clubs plans to install a new state-of-the-art solar grid. This comes in light of the increasing cost of utilities, which is only exacerbated by the age of their building. The installation of a new solar grid would make a great deal of difference in reducing costs to the club, and could be utilised to provide clean energy to surrounding businesses.\nI fully support the clubs ambitions to make their building more sustainable and ensure it remains part of the community for decades to come.",

Now, their provisional funding settlement gives rural areas around 40% less spending power per head than urban areas. This comes in the light of plans to abolish district councils in Sussex, and across the country, and merge their powers into larger regional combined authorities.\nAnalysis from the Rural Services Network confirms that while urban areas are seeing increased government funding, rural funding has flatlined—yet both are still expected to provide the same level of services.\nKieran said: \"There’s a lot of talk about reorganisation, but it does nothing to fix the deep unfairness in funding. Once again, Labour is proving they don’t understand rural areas—putting big cities first time and time again. Rural communities deserve better.\"\nCampaigners and local leaders are calling on the government to reverse these cuts and ensure fair funding for rural councils.",

Do always feel free to forward this email to anyone else you think who might enjoy it so they can sign up (done online at www.drkieranmullan.org.uk).\nThe Christmas break is now firmly behind us, and Parliament has now swung back into action. Kicking things back off, I spoke with Catherine Fuller, the Environment Agency's Area Director for our region. With water pollution such a crucial local issue this another meeting I have held that is trying to drive progress on this issue. I will be saying more about this early this year.\nI had the privilege of signing the Holocaust Educational Trust’s Book of Commitment at Westminster– a pledge to remember the millions of people murdered during the Holocaust. Only through the education of young people and adults, can we ensure that the awful crimes committed are not forgotten.\nEarlier this week I joined other East Sussex MPs at a roundtable with Sussex Police to discuss local crime, where I highlighted concerns including speeding, young people driving under the influence, rural crime and shoplifting. I look forward to supporting Sussex Police in stamping out these serious crimes.\nIn the constituency I met with Kevin Richmond, CEO of Sussex Community Foundation, and was pleased to hear more details of the work they do to help fund local organisations.\nI also had the opportunity to visit Pevensey and Westham Sports Club, home to Pevensey Cricket Club and Pevensey and Westham FC, where I met with the clubs hardworking Chairs. I heard about how their sports pavilion is in urgent need of renovation, so will be speaking with the Football Foundation to explore fundraising opportunities.\nWhilst in Pevensey, I met with Chair of Pevensey Parish Council, Peter Lowton, who told me about the key issues being faced in the village, as well as the exciting projects underway. I also had the chance to look around The Mint House, which has recently secured grant support for renovation!\nAnd in what could only be described as an inspiring story of community spirit, I visited Pevensey Community Hub, a space now serving as a community library, tourism information centre, and hospital car service – run by local volunteers – and based in an impressively converted former public toilets.\nLastly, I wanted to address the support available for those who might be impacted by the Labour Government’s cruel decision to remove the Winter Fuel Payments. Cold Weather Payments are now available for those on low income and certain benefits, and with the cold snap, certain postcodes are also eligible. Please check out the end of my newsletter for all the information.\nHave a great weekend.\nThis week's newsletter:\n- Meeting with the Environment Agency\n- Holocaust Educational Trust - Book of Commitment\n- Meeting with Sussex Police to Discuss Local Crime\n- Sussex Community Foundation\n- Supporting Sports in Pevensey & Westham\n- Protecting Pevensey's Heritage & Addressing Local Concerns\n- Supporting Pevensey's Vibrant Community Hub\n- Cold Winter Payments\nMeeting with the Environment Agency\nThis week I spoke with Catherine Fuller, Area Director for the Environment Agency, as part of efforts to tackle local water pollution.\nWhilst I have previously met with the EA to discuss the ongoing problems faced, in this meeting we were able to discuss the ‘Pollution Risk Forecasts’, or PRF warnings many constituents have contacted me about since I became MP.\nThe EA has made it clear that the main cause for PRF warnings is not actually the release of untreated sewage by Southern Water, but instead a myriad of factors as outlined below:\n- Urban diffuse pollution draining directly into the Egerton Park Stream, or entering through the surface water sewer system, is likely to be the main source of pollution. The stream has been extensively monitored and often contaminated.\n- Other investigations have shown some wrong connections (private foul sewers plumbed into the surface water drains) as well as leaking foul sewers very close to surface water sewers. This is likely to be the main source of pollution to the stream. There have been many successes in locating wrong connections, but there is still much to do.\n- Road and roof run-off, especially ‘first flush’ (heavy rain after a dry period) can be contaminated with bird and dog faeces, and other general waste from urban surfaces, and so likely to be an additional source.\nNow that is not to say Southern Water do not play their part. Ofwat has now agreed Southern Water’s Draft Determination Plan for 2025-30, so I will be requesting clear timelines and goals for reductions in CSO releases. I will be saying more about this early this year.\nHowever, I felt it useful to share my findings from conversations with professionals in the field.\nI will continue to press on with this important issue, to make sure that the sea is able to be enjoyed by everyone who lives in Bexhill, or those who visit for our incredible beaches.\nHolocaust Educational Trust - Book of Commitment\nAhead of Holocaust Memorial Day on 27 January, I was pleased to join the Holocaust Educational Trust in signing their Book of Commitment – a pledge to honour the near countless who were murdered during the Holocaust.\nThis year is a significant one as it marks 80 years since the liberation of Nazi concentration and death camps across Europe, bringing an end to the genocidal Nazi regime. With so few survivors still alive, it is more important than ever that we make strong efforts to remember the atrocities committed.\nOnly by continuing to educate young people and adults, can we ensure that the awful crimes committed are not forgotten.\nMeeting with Sussex Police to Discuss Local Crime\nEarlier this week I was pleased to meet with Police and Crime Commissioner Katy Bourne and Chief Constable Jo Shine, to discuss various crime related issues in the Bexhill & Battle constituency.\nDuring our discussions I highlighted concerns from constituents over road safety issues, including young people driving under the influence and speeding more generally.\nGiven the high number of farmers we have locally, I also queried how effectively Sussex Police has been in tackling rural crime, touching on any potential compensation available for those affected by this crime.\nAnd lastly, we spoke of the need to crack down on preventing shoplifting, an absolute priority to support local businesses. I know this is an important issue to many constituents. It is critical that criminals know they cannot just get away with stealing from hard working residents.\nSussex Community Foundation\nIt was great to meet with Kevin Richmond, CEO of Sussex Community Foundation to hear more details of the work they do, having met with local organisations that benefit from their funding.\nA huge thank you to the amazing people that give funding to them to support local causes. If you are part of a local group looking for funding make sure to check them out!\nSupporting Sports in Pevensey & Westham\nLast week I was pleased of the opportunity to visit Pevensey and Westham Sports Club, home to Pevensey Cricket Club and Pevensey and Westham FC, meeting with Tim Hilton and the other hardworking Chairs.\nThere, they explained to me the urgent need for renovation of their sports pavilions to improve inclusivity and accessibility for those who want to get involved in sports locally.\nGiven the incredible work to grow participation and make sports accessible for everyone, especially younger players, and the growing number of girls’ teams, this is a critical project to get behind, and I’m proud to support their partnership with the parish council as they look to secure these much-needed upgrades.\nNone of this success would be possible without the amazing volunteers who give their time every week to support these clubs. Thank you for everything you do! If you have family or friends who love community sports, I’d encourage you to get involved—these clubs are all about teamwork, friendship, and fun.\nI’ll also be speaking with the Football Foundation in February to explore fundraising opportunities for the pavilion renovation. Let’s work together to make this happen and support even more young people in enjoying the benefits of team sports!\nProtecting Pevensey's Heritage & Addressing Local Concerns\nI spent a fascinating day with Peter Lowton, Chair of Pevensey Parish Council, learning about the key issues facing the village and the exciting projects underway.\nOne of the highlights was visiting The Mint House on Pevensey High Street.\nThis historically significant Grade II* listed 16th-century timber-framed hall is a treasure of our local heritage, with royal connections and a vivid history.\nHowever, heavy traffic through Pevensey and neighbouring Westham is taking a toll, causing structural damage to the building and loss of its ancient plaster and wall paintings. I know that this is an issue which also concerns residents as increased traffic is creating noise and safety concerns along these narrow village roads.\nThe Mint House Trust is committed to the preservation and restoration of this landmark, having secured grant support from the Heritage Fund UK, with their ultimate goal to transform it into a museum and eco-heritage centre for everyone to enjoy.\nI’m committed to working with the parish council to explore solutions to these challenges and support The Mint House Trust in its important mission. Protecting our heritage and making our roads safer must go hand in hand.\nSupporting Pevensey's Vibrant Community Hub\nRecently I had the pleasure of visiting the Pevensey Community Hub - a space that serves as a community library, tourism information centre, and hospital car service – all run by dedicated local volunteers.\nI met with Cllr Daniel Brookbank, who shared the story of how these vital services found a new home in an impressively converted former public toilet block in Pevensey’s public car park.\nThe space now includes a welcoming hub for hobbies, social connections, and signposting to other services, while still providing public toilets and a fully equipped ‘changing place’ disabled facility.\nPevensey is a shining example of what a strong community can achieve, so thank you to all those who give their time voluntarily to make it so.\nIf you have not already headed down there to check it out yourself, I recommend taking the time to visit!\nFor updates check out their Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100079054986824\nCold Winter Payments\nAs we get into the colder months, I'm keen to do what I can to support those impacted by the Labour Governments cruel decision to remove the Winter Fuel Payment from millions of pensioners across the country.\nDuring particularly cold periods, Cold Weather Payment are triggered for those on low income and certain benefits, including Pension Credit, Mortgage Interest Support and Universal Credit. You’ll be eligible for payment if the average temperature in your area is recorded as zero degrees celsius or below over 7 consecutive days. You’ll get £25 for each 7 day period of very cold weather.\nBecause of the recent cold snap, residents of TN18, TN19, TN5 will qualify for a payment of £25.\nYou should receive the payment automatically. But if you haven't received anything, and think you meet the criteria above, please do contact the Pension Service - https://www.gov.uk/contact-pension-service\nOR\nJobCentre - https://www.gov.uk/contact-jobcentre-plus",

As our MP, it will be my mission job to relentlessly push the water companies to clean up their mess - no excuses.\nSince becoming MP I have been keeping up to date with Southern Water and the Environment Agency to get a better grip on the challenges Bexhill faces with its water quality. As the Environment Agency independently monitor, and provide the alerts, on water quality, they are a reliable source when understanding these challenges.\nThe EA are clear that only around 10% of the Pollution Risk Forecast alerts they issue are likely to be caused by sewage discharges from combined sewage overflows. I think it is important that we understand this so that we have realistic expectations about how quickly we will see an improvement.\nApproximately 90% of the forecasts are likely to be caused by:\n- Urban diffuse pollution draining directly into the Egerton Park Stream, or entering through the surface water sewer system, is likely to be the main source of pollution. The stream has been extensively monitored and often contaminated.\n- Southern Water investigations have shown some wrong connections (private foul sewers plumbed into the surface water drains) as well as leaking foul sewers very close to surface water sewers.

It will take time. But with strong cross-agency work identifying the exact causes, I’m hopeful we will start to see positive changes.\nTo stay up to date on information about CSO releases, you can use Southern Water's new ‘Rivers and Seas Watch’ map. It provides details on genuine releases and alerts when a release is found to be non-genuine.\nFor anyone unaware, a non-genuine release occurs when an earlier warning is updated after investigations show the release didn’t actually happen. This can be due to several factors including wildlife interference, sensor malfunctions, human error, or power issues.\nMy current focus now is on securing a meaningful local target for a reduction in overflows so that our community can hold them to account on making progress as part of their overall plans up to 2030. This is an issue I will continue to work on and will try my best to keep everyone informed of the efforts I am making on your behalf to address this problem.\nKieran visiting an outflow monitoring point with Cllr Ian Hollidge",

  "https_www_drkieranmullan_org_uk_/https_www_drkieranmullan_org_uk_news_tackling-ongoing-issue-water-pollution/content_12.html": "As the days grow longer, many of us are looking forward to spending more time on our beautiful beaches. One of my top priorities as MP for Bexhill and Battle is to do what I can to help tackle the ongoing issue of water pollution in our rivers and bathing waters. This is a matter that many constituents regularly contact me about, often sharing ‘Pollution Risk Forecasts’ (PRFs) from the Environment Agency or combined sewerage overflow (CSO) release alerts from Surfers Against Sewage. I’ve done my best to respond to all of you on this issue and will continue to keep you updated as I receive new information from experts in the field.\nSince becoming MP, I’ve been working closely with professionals to understand the primary causes of pollution affecting Bexhill’s bathing water. The Environment Agency, which independently monitors and issues water quality alerts, has made it clear that only around 10% of the pollution risk alerts they send out are likely due to sewage discharges from Southern Water’s combined sewer overflows. In fact, the majority of PRF alerts are likely from other sources.\nFor example, there is evidence that water draining into and from the Egerton Park stream or entering the system via the surface water sewer system, is likely the main source of pollution of Bexhill bathing waters. Heavy rainfall, particularly after a dry period, can carry bird and dog faeces, as well as other waste from urban surfaces, into the water. The Environment Agency then picks up the presence of the associated bacteria in their regular testing and uses it to model when this might be happening on a day-to-day basis. The testing of the pollution isn’t live and there will be times when a warning is sent out when it would have otherwise been safe to swim.\nAnother source of pollution is illegal connections and leaking sewers. Southern Water’s investigations have identified some illegal connections (private foul drains connected to surface water drains) and leaking foul sewers near surface water systems. While there have been successes in locating and correcting these issues, much work remains.\nThese complexities illustrate why improving Bexhill’s bathing water quality will take time. It’s important to have realistic expectations about how quickly we’ll see noticeable improvements. If we think this problem is largely caused by Southern Water, no matter how much they do we will be left disappointed if we still get the same risk of pollution warnings.\nHowever, Southern Water does of course have a critical role in cleaning up our rivers and seas by reducing CSO releases. For those who are not aware, CSO releases are often the result of heavy rain. The system was developed to prevent the combination of clean rainwater and wastewater from toilets, bathrooms and kitchens overwhelming our sewage system as they are conveyed in the same pipe to a sewage treatment works. Due to the potential for this combination to then backup and flood people’s homes, or public areas, CSOs act as an emergency release valve. Though it has been concerning to note that Southern Water recently had CSO discharges in Bexhill on days without any rainfall. I’ve written to them to demand a clear explanation for this.\nTo ensure Southern Water is held accountable, I have requested reduction targets for discharges and a list of specific steps they are going to take to tackle them by and when. These targets will allow us to assess the effectiveness of Southern Water’s system upgrades and better understand the other factors contributing to pollution in our sea. By addressing these issues collectively, we can work towards reducing their impact and confidently enjoy our incredible beaches.\nPlease rest assured, I am fully committed to doing what I can to tackle this critical issue.",
  "https_www_drkieranmullan_org_uk_/https_www_drkieranmullan_org_uk_news_stop-family-farm-tax-campaign/content_55.html": "I’m backing the campaign calling on the Labour Government’s to reverse its decision to abandon farmers by announcing changes to Agricultural Property Relief (APR) and Business Property Relief (BPR) – essentially introducing a Family farm Tax.\nA total of 512 farm holdings in Bexhill & Battle are now at risk!\nIn a world with tightened margins, record inflation, extreme weather and increased production costs, many farmers are already struggling to ensure that they are financially viable for the next year. What farmers need most is a government who understands this and reflects it in their budget. Sadly, this is not the case.\nIt is astonishing that the Minister admitted he had only read about the impact altering APR & BPR would have the weekend after the decision was announced!\nUnder the last Government, the £2.4 billion farming budget was maintained annually. Any underspend was rolled forward, and the average value of farming payment schemes was increased by 10 per cent. Furthermore, the previous Government launched the biggest package of grants worth £427 million for farm businesses, supporting productivity and innovation.\nIndeed, Ministers in the last Government prioritised food security and set a commitment to grow 60 per cent of our food at home. It is true to say that we didn’t get everything right when it came to spending that money and making sure it was getting to farmers and helping them grow our food but we always maintained the protections for farms that ensure they can be passed on between the generations.\nI am concerned about the lack of vision or ambition for the sector, as evidenced by the scarce 87 words included in the Labour manifesto on farming.\nThe Family Farm Tax will hit local family farmers hard, making it almost impossible for many ordinary farmers to pass on their holdings, some of which will have been in the family for decades.\nI know most people are very proud of the fact that we have families that have farmed our land for generations and I know it is sometimes difficult to persuade the next generation to do so. This will make it even harder and for many farms will simply mean the numbers don’t add up.\nIf you have not already, I recommend doing so to ensure your voice of opposition is heard amongst the thousands of others by signing the campaign:\nhttps://www.whatlaboursaid.com/stop-the-family-farm-tax\nI also raised it in Parliament when I had the opportunity to ask the Defra Minister of State whether the Government would be rethinking their decision on family farm tax – you can watch the clip here.\nWhilst the Minister claimed that the NFU had praised the Government on keeping to our spending plans he was omitting what the NFU have said about this tax.\nI plan to attend the protest in London later in the month where I'm due to meet a number of other local farmers as we continue this campaign.",

  "https_www_drkieranmullan_org_uk_/https_www_drkieranmullan_org_uk_sewage-pollution-pollution-risk-forecasts/content_75.html": "I am of course very disappointed at the number of alerts for pollution being discharged into the sea and agree that we need to see a drastic reduction, which is why I’m committed to tackling storm overflows and protecting public health and the environment from discharges. Indeed, I made cleaning up our waters one of my six priorities as part of my plan when campaigning during the election.\nOne of my first acts as MP was to ask for an urgent meeting with officials at Southern Water to open a dialogue as quickly as possible. Southern Water has released their 2024 plan for pollution reduction, which outlines their targets. I will be reviewing this plan, which I have linked below, and will not hesitate to refer them to a regulator if they do not deliver.\nhttps://www.southernwater.co.uk/about-us/our-plans/pollution-incident-reduction-plan/\nHowever, the Environment Agency has confirmed that actually the Pollution Risk Forecast (PRF) warnings relate to a much wider scope than just sewage discharges from water company storm overflows (CSOs), so even when there are no discharges from CSOs taking place there are still occasions when there is a risk of lower coastal water quality.\nAs I understand, these PRFs are based on a number of factors including rain, tide and wind, which can affect the levels of bacteria that get washed into the sea from the surrounding catchments. This includes run off from urban surface water drainage, agricultural land and discharges of higher than normally contaminated waters via rivers and streams. When these factors combine, the Environment Agency issue a pollution risk warning.\nI think it is only fair that residents and visitors should be able to receive more up-to-date, real-time information as to what is actually happening. I will therefore be following up with both agencies to discuss how they can better inform everyone of the actual quality of our waters.\nIn the meantime, Southern Water have provided a tool which records whether the alerts sent out as a PRF were followed by a pollution incident or not. You can find this information by following the link here and selecting Bexhill as the bathing site.\nDespite ongoing troubles, I think it is only fair to acknowledge that there has been progress by the last Government to address storm overflows. This includes the launching of the Storm Overflows Discharge Reduction Plan in August 2022, which set out stringent targets to protect people and the environment. This was backed up by up to £60 billion capital investment, representing the largest infrastructure programme in water company history. Legally binding through the Environment Act 2021, the plan prioritises storm overflows that could cause the most harm while balancing the impact on consumer bills.\nWater companies have also been issued tightened permits for storm overflows to ensure they deliver the Storm Overflows Discharge Reduction Plan’s targets. Water companies must increase their network capacity and treat sewage before discharge, while massively reducing all discharges.\nEarlier this year, the previous Government introduced a fast-tracked investment of £180m over 12 months, which is expected to prevent more than 8000 sewage spills polluting English waterways. The accelerated improvements, which will be delivered by April 2025, support the targets under the Storm Overflows Discharge Reduction Plan.\nFollowing a consultation on strengthening fines for polluters, legislation was tabled to remove the limit of £250,000 that can be imposed for environmental offences, meaning penalties can be proportionate to the degree of environmental harm and culpability and can act as a powerful deterrent. This would offer regulators a quicker method of enforcement than lengthy criminal prosecutions, although I am aware that the most serious cases will continue to be taken through criminal proceedings. As set out in the Plan for Water, future environmental fines from water companies will be re-invested into a new Water Restoration Fund.\nLooking ahead to the current Government’s plans, they have made promises to give regulators new powers to block the payment of bonuses to executives who pollute our waterways; as well as bring criminal charges against persistent law breakers in their election manifesto. I will be following this issue closely to see if Ministers stick to this manifesto commitment.\nI will of course keep constituents updated on any developments made during meetings with Southern Water, and if the time comes where I make a formal challenge in referring them to the regulator.\nI am also grateful for any future alerts on forecasts for pollution into the sea. My website will always carry the latest updates on what I am doing on this important issue.\nKind regards,\nKieran",

Not only have they underestimated and undervalued the farms affected by this harsh new tax, but the knock-on effects for the whole country could be disastrous.\n“I will stand beside our family farmers in the Bexhill and Battle constituency and those from across the country to show the Labour Government they have made not only a bad decision, but the wrong decision. I will remain committed to helping local farmers fight this harsh new tax and gathering together will show Keir Starmer how poor his judgement is.\n“And I would also urge people to sign our petition at www.stopthefarmtax.com,” he added.\nIn photo left to right: John Marland, Roderick Mair, Kieran Mullan MP, Philip Wheeler, Michael Payne.",

  "https_www_drkieranmullan_org_uk_/https_www_drkieranmullan_org_uk_news_bexhill-mp-calls-meeting-discuss-safety-a259/content_42.html": "Last Tuesday (15 April) Bexhill and Battle MP, Kieran Mullan, held a meeting with National Highways, East Sussex County Council, Sussex Police, local councillors and Hooe community representatives at his constituency office in Bexhill to discuss concerns about road safety on the A259.\nThe meeting was called following a spate of serious accidents on the A259, at the end of last year, including a fatality. The MP wanted to establish the cause of the accidents and discuss whether more could be done to improve road safety along the route. As well as the tragic consequences for those involved in the accidents, an emergency road closure of the A259 results in hours of gridlock on adjacent local roads including Sluice Lane and lanes in Hooe village.\nSussex Police and National Highways (who manage the A259) explained that following the fatality near the Custom Café, they carried out analysis of recent crash data to establish whether road layout, speeding or other factors relating to the road played a part in the accidents. (The Police only have access to crash data relating to fatal or injurious accidents, data on other incidents which the emergency services don’t attend are dealt with by insurance companies and is not available to them.) A vehicle speed analysis concluded that speeding was not an issue at this section of road as average speeds were 46mph and the highest 15% of speeds were 53mph.\nSussex Police and National Highways explained that twenty thousand vehicles use the road each day and, over the last 10 years, there have been 29 collisions on the stretch of the A259 between Little Common and Pevensey roundabout which resulted in serious injury or death. Speeding was identified as the cause of one of those accidents. Other causes were medical incidents, drink/drug driving and driver error. Therefore, from a policing point of view, road safety on the A259 is not considered a major concern.\nFour of the recent accidents happened at the junctions to Hooe village which is used as an alternative route to Battle. East Sussex County Council who maintain the adjacent roads also carried out analysis of the cause of those accidents in conjunction with National Highways and the police. This concluded that driver error was the cause of those accidents.\nCouncillors and community representatives from Hooe village, shared the lived experience of local residents who continually raise their concerns to them about the safety of the A259. They also discussed the challenges on the remaining road network when the A259 is closed. The villagers in Hooe often find themselves trapped in as does the community at Normans Bay and Cooden when their roads are used as unofficial diversion routes. HGVs diverting along these villages routes cause extensive damage to local roads.\nGiven community concerns and the increasing volume of traffic using the A259 through Little Common, Kieran asked National Highways and East Sussex County Council to consider whether junction improvements or engineering solutions could help the driver experience and improve road safety. National Highways confirmed that they are about to commence a whole route study of the A259 and A27 in East Sussex to obtain more data on road safety and driver behaviour. A similar study had been carried out on the A21 between Lamberhurst and Hastings and has resulted in speed limit changes, road engineering improvements and other measures which are already showing improvements in road safety. Depending on the results from the A259 study, funding for road safety improvements would be sought from the Department of Transport.\nKieran asked that he and councillors are kept informed of the progress of this study and confirmed he would be supportive of any funding bids to improve road safety.\nFollowing the meeting Kieran said: “It was very helpful to talk to Sussex Police, National Highways and East Sussex County Council about the growing local concerns for safety on the A259. I am encouraged that a whole route study of the A259 and A27 is being carried out this financial year. This is a key transport route for the constituency and is vital to the local economy. With more expected housing growth, I am concerned about its resilience and safety. East Sussex is poorly served by decent transport infrastructure. Ultimately, if this area is expected to take more housing, we must also have a stronger and safer transport infrastructure to support it.”\nIn photo from left to right:\nPeter Doodes, Hooe community rep, Cllr Ian Hollidge, ESCC, Pam Doodes, Hooe community rep, Cllr Nuala Geary (ESCC), Cllr Connor Winter (RDC and Bexhill Town Council",
  "https_www_drkieranmullan_org_uk_/https_www_drkieranmullan_org_uk_news_newsletter-11/content_83.html": "Welcome to this week's newsletter!\nThe past couple of weeks in politics have been particularly eventful, with the 2nd reading of the Assisted Dying Bill taking place last Friday.\nI know this is an issue which people from across the constituency felt very strongly about. I was also privileged to be asked to give a short summary speech to all MPs after the debate as I had been so sympathetic to both sides and so it was thought I would be able to give a fair summary. As the topic is so complex I have provided a detailed explanation of the logic on my decision making in the article below.\nIn other news, this year’s Christmas Card winner has been decided. Now that voting is complete, I'm pleased to give a huge congratulations to Barnaby from Bodiam School! Barnaby's card will be sent to the King and the Speaker of The House as my Christmas Card!\nAlso a congratulations to Thea from Burwash Primary School and Hope from St Mary's Special School and College, whose card designs came runner up!\nIn PMQs this week I got to ask a question of the Prime Minister and chose to raise concerns over the potential widespread closure of vital direct-run Post Offices. I'm glad the PM has agreed to ensure the relevant Minister meets with affected MPs.\nI was also able to secure a meeting with the Minister for Care to discuss the issues GP surgeries in Bexhill and Battle are having moving premises, with the Minister agreeing to meet local stakeholders to find a solution and get these projects moving again.\nOf course it is not just GP surgeries struggling, but also community pharmacies, who have taken on greater responsibilities on behalf of the NHS. Late last month I visited Sidley Pharmacy to better understand the difficulties faced. I plan to assist lobby where I can to ensure these crucial services will continue to operate for the community.\nLast weekend was a very busy one for me in the constituency. On Saturday, joined by Conservative Association members, we headed down to the Post Office to collect some more signatures, and speak with constituents.\nLater in the day I met with the Bexhill-on-Sea Working Age Parkinson’s Group and heard about the need for better information at diagnosis, before heading to the Association of Carer's Winter Gift Market.\nIn the afternoon I headed down to Bexhill for the Christmas Lights Switch-On event, with lots of lively performances and festive market stalls offering a whole range of different foods and drinks. I particularly enjoyed seeing families enjoying the activities, from meeting Santa in his sleigh to watching the adorable donkeys.\nAnd on Sunday morning I took part in the Santa dash. Seems a big group of Santa's gains a lot of attention as there were lots of hoots of support from passing cars and crowds cheering everyone on!\nThank you so much to all the different organisations who made these events possible over the weekend!\nBack down in Parliament, earlier this week, I was pleased to meet Kate Tym & Kate Dyer, founders of Coffin Club UK, specialised in funeral celebrant training, and part of the Small Biz 100. It was good to hear how successful they have been sharing their experience and knowledge to other celebrants across the UK.\nThe week prior, I was honoured to attend Victim Support’s reception in Parliament to celebrate their 50th anniversary. Victim Support is a vital service, helping around 140,000 people every year. Thank you to the incredible staff and volunteers who work tirelessly to support victims of crime.\nSainsbury’s held their annual Christmas drop-in, where I signed a giant card to thank and wish a merry Christmas to all Sainsbury’s colleagues, suppliers and charity partners.\nAlso a small reminder - please make sure to show kindness to retail employees over the festive season, even when things don't go quite as planned. hose working in retail over the Christmas period are helping to make sure we have the best time possible.\nAs part of their drive to share information gathered from across the UK, Cancer Research UK held a drop-in session which saw almost 100 volunteer Campaigns Ambassadors from across the UK attend to speak with MPs about the cancer issues which they have identified as most significant.\nAnd lastly, I wanted to give a bit of focus to scam awareness. Last week was Scam Awareness week, and I know a few constituents got in touch to request information be shared – so if you are interested in some general advice check out the last article.\nThank you for reading through. I'll be back with my final newsletter of the year in a couple of weeks!\nHave a great weekend.\nThis week's newsletter:\n- Christmas Card Competition Winners!\n- Vote on Assisted Dying Bill\n- Update on Bexhill Post Office\n- Meeting with Minister for Care\n- Support for Community Pharmacies\n- Early Onset Parkinson's Group Meeting\n- Carer's Winter Gift Market\n- Switch-On of Bexhill's Christmas Lights\n- Bexhill Santa Dash\n- Small Business Saturday - Small Biz 100\n- 50th Anniversary of Victim Support\n- Sainsbury's Christmas Drop-In\n- Cancer Research UK Reception\n- Scam Awareness\nChristmas Card Competition Winners!\nThis year's Christmas Card competition has been a very exciting one! With so many entries, from lots of schools, it was a difficult decision picking the finalists for the public vote.\nNow that voting is complete I'm pleased to give a huge congratulations to Barnaby from Bodiam School! Barnaby's green Christmas candy design will be sent to the King and the Speaker of the House as my Christmas Card!\nA congratulations to Thea from Burwash Primary School and Hope from St Mary's Special School and College, whose card designs came runner up!\nIf you would like to purchase a set of these Christmas Cards for yourself for charity, you will be able to from Blackbrook's Garden Centre who have been an amazing sponsor for this festive competition.\nThank you so much to everyone who has taken part and made this possible!\nWatch the video linked above to see a special guest officially announce the winner.\nVote on Assisted Dying Bill\nLast Friday MPs voted on the bill to bring in assisted dying which was passed.\nThis is an issue hundreds of you contacted me about, which is why leading up to the vote I had two listening sessions with constituents, both for and against, to hear your views. These were very moving sessions as you might expect with discussions of life and death involved. I gave this matter a great deal of thought.\nI was also privileged to be asked to give a short summary speech to all MPs after the debate as I had been so sympathetic to both sides and so it was thought I would be able to give a fair summary. As it was a free vote it was not for me to argue the case for or against for the Official Opposition – just lay out the arguments we were considering.\nIn the end I voted against, but it was very finely balanced. As I said in my speech, my time working as a doctor in A&E has actually made me sympathetic to both arguments. I've seen the pain in the eyes of relatives who want to ease the suffering of their loved ones. And I can foresee a time when I might share their pain and also want that option for myself.\nBut I’ve also held the hand of frail elderly people, forgotten by their families, forgotten by society and feeling themselves to be nothing but a burden. Many MPs were concerned about where this bill might leave them. This left me with a difficult dilemma.\nYou can read my whole speech in Hansard, linked below, which explains more fully the issues I was weighing up to come to my decision.\nVoting against does not mean I don’t continue to have enormous sympathy for those who experiencing suffering at the end of their lives. But in the end, I felt the risks to other people and to how doctors, the NHS and society manage death and dying were too great.\nAsking the government, through the NHS, to take responsibility for ending life instead of protecting it and the guilt and burden people might now feel they have to die was just too great of a concern. I know many people won’t agree with that.\nThank you to all those that contacted me to share your own views. Before judging anyone that disagreed with you in either direction too harshly I would encourage you to read/watch my speech and read/watch the full debate as I think it exemplified what a complex issue this was to have to make a black and white decision about:\nRead my speech here:\nRead the whole debate here and watch the whole debate here.\nUpdate on the Bexhill Post Office\nThis week I got to ask a question at PMQs. I raised concerns over the potential widespread closure of vital direct-run Post Offices.\nAsking a question like this at PMQs helps to make sure the Government takes this issue seriously. I'm glad the Prime Minister has agreed to ensure the relevant Minister meets with affected MPs.\nI’m also pleased to update everyone that the campaign to ‘Save Bexhill Post Office’ has now received over 3,000 signatures!\nLast Saturday I was joined by a number of Conservative other local Councillors gathering signatures for the petition.\nThank you so much to all those who have already signed it. If you haven’t done so already, head over to my website linked here and sign – we need everyone’s support.\nAlso thank you to those Conservative Association members who joined me. Certainly a chilly start to the day, but a great show of the support amongst members to save such a vital local service that so many people rely on.\nMeeting with Minister for Care\nFollowing recent meetings with GP surgeries in Bexhill and Battle, I met with the Minister for Care to discuss the issues they are facing with their plans to move to larger more modern premises.\nThere are clear roadblocks obstructing progress on projects, not just in Bexhill and Battle, but across the country.\nI was very pleased that the Minister agreed to meet with local stakeholders to try and find a solution and get these projects moving again.\nAccess to high quality healthcare is crucial for our local community and I will continue to support GP practices in Bexhill and Battle to ensure they are fit for the future. More updates to follow as progress is made!\nSupport for Community Pharmacies\nLate last month I visited Sidley Pharmacy, an award-winning community pharmacy, to hear from owner Mr Sukhy Uppal about the challenges being faced by the industry as a whole – specifically issues with funding, drug shortages and staff retention.\nAlthough community pharmacies are private businesses, they provide services and prescriptions on behalf of the NHS, a vital role for local residents making them an integral part of the community. However, recently the NHS has been relying more and more on community pharmacies to take on even greater roles in primary care, such as the Pharmacy First initiative.\nI know that Sukhy is supportive of these types of initiatives, however, for community pharmacies to continue operating effectively it will be essential for the NHS and government to fully support them and have the right approach to funding the services they are asked to provide.\nI will maintain an open dialogue and look to assist and lobby where I can to ensure these crucial services will continue to operate for the community.\nEarly Onset Parkinson's Group Meeting\nThis past weekend, I was able to join a meeting of the Bexhill-on-Sea Working Age Parkinson’s Group. A big thank you to Linda, Helen, and everyone else for having me at this very important meeting. I'm grateful to everyone who shared their experiences and insights.\nCrucially, I heard about the need for better information at diagnosis. Many local patients aren’t receiving the Parkinson’s UK information pack when first diagnosed and this small change could make a huge difference going forward.\nWe also talked about different models of care they advocate for and some of the challenges of the benefits assessment process.\nDid you know?\n- Parkinson’s is the fastest-growing neurological condition globally.\n- It presents differently in each person, with over 40 symptoms—30 of which are non-motor.\n- Better awareness and early diagnosis are crucial for effective treatment and support.\n- Implementing a collaborative care approach could significantly improve outcomes and quality of life.\nIf you have Parkinson’s, or you know someone who does, and are in need of local support, do not hesitate to join the Group’s coffee mornings. They meet up monthly on the last Saturday, at the Cooden Beach Golf Club in Bexhill. For more information, click here.\nCarer's Winter Gift Market\nI had a fantastic time on Saturday at the Association of Carers’ Winter Gift Market.\nIt was a pleasure speaking with Lucy about the vital work this charity does for unpaid carers across East Sussex. Their volunteer-led services offer crucial support and respite to those dedicating their lives to caring for loved ones.\nA huge thank you to everyone who attended, the amazing stallholders, and the incredible volunteers who made the day such a success. Together, they raised just under £2,000 to support unpaid carers—an incredible achievement! Massive thanks to the The Relais Cooden Beach for hosting the event.\nIt was also a wonderful opportunity to catch up with Jan! I first met her during the election campaign while door-knocking—she was out delivering leaflets to raise awareness about the charity's incredible work.\nThe Association of Carers' has been making a difference since the 1980s, currently supporting 152 carers with the help of 142 volunteers. However, with 263 families still on their waiting list, they are always needing more volunteers.\nIf you can help, please consider getting involved. Find out more on their website linked above or follow them on social media @associationofcarers\nSwitch-On of Bexhill's Christmas Lights\nI had a fantastic time last weekend at the Bexhill Christmas Lights Switch-On event in our wonderful town centre! It was an afternoon filled with holiday cheer, music, and community spirit.\nFrom the lively performances by the Royal British Legion Band and the Bexhill Musical Theatre Group, to the festive market stalls offering everything from mulled wine to handmade gifts, there was something for everyone!\nA big thank you to Bexhill-on-Sea Town Council , Bexhill Lions, Bexhill Rotary, and all the local performers, volunteers, and the organisers who made this event so special. I particularly enjoyed seeing families enjoying the activities, from meeting Santa in his sleigh to watching the adorable donkeys.\nA great way to start off the December festivities!\nBexhill Santa Dash\nI had lots of fun at the Bexhill Santa Dash on Sunday! Thank you to Bexhill Lions and The De La Warr Pavilion for organising.\nThere were lots of hoots of support from passing cars and crowds cheering everyone one - luckily we even escaped the rain. I was not expecting to see a pony on the run too!\nI broke my ankle badly a year ago and so this was the first time I've run 5k since then – a bit of personal progress.\nThanks to Lee Floyd for the especially red photo!\nSmall Business Saturday - Small Biz 100\nEarlier this week I met with Kate Tym & Kate Dyer, founders of Coffin Club UK, specialised in funeral celebrant training, and one of the small businesses chosen as part of the ‘Small Biz 100’, highlighting 100 small businesses, one a day for 100 days leading up to Small Business Saturday 2024!\nI also noted that Catsfield Christmas Tree Farm is another business in the constituency, chosen as part of the Small Biz 100. Although we didn’t meet at the event, a big congratulations to you!\nKate & Kate, having started their own celebrants company based in Sussex and Kent, were inspired to share their knowledge and experience conducting funerals.\nThe first ‘Coffin Club’ they set-up was their own, based in East Sussex – since then they have trained celebrants, creating other Coffin Clubs across the whole of the UK, as far afield as Aberdeenshire West.\nThis is a fantastic service, in an industry which is particularly emotive. Speaking with Kate & Kate, when they visited Parliament, they highlighted that death is something so many people feel uncomfortable speaking about, but we shouldn’t feel this way.\nI agree with their thoughts – a life is to be celebrated, and to know that such experienced celebrants are teaching others their skill truly a great thing.\nGood luck to Kate & Kate as they continue sharing their experience with celebrants around the UK.\n50th Anniversary of Victim Support\nI was honoured to attend Victim Support's reception in Parliament to celebrate their 50th anniversary and pay tribute to the incredible staff and volunteers who work tirelessly to support victims of crime.\nFounded in 1974, Victim Support helps around 140,000 people every year—offering free, confidential support 24/7 for those affected by domestic abuse, sexual violence, fraud, hate crime, and more. Their work is truly life-changing.\nI’m committed to championing support for victims in Bexhill and Battle and beyond. A huge thank you to Victim Support for five decades of invaluable service.\nSainsbury's Christmas Drop-In\nRecently I attended Sainsbury's annual Parliamentary Reception to speak with representatives about the different farmers, suppliers, and charity partners locally, who are involved with the organisation.\nAs you will see, Sainsbury's brought a giant card for MP's to sign and show their thanks and wish a merry Christmas to all Sainsbury's colleagues, suppliers and charity partners.\nI was interested to learn that Sainsbury’s source from 17 beef farms based in the Bexhill & Battle constituency and are partnered with two local foodbanks – totalling 29,646 meals donated.\nThough Sainsbury’s is a very large national organisation, it is encouraging to see the work which goes in to support local organisations, and better the community as a whole.\nEmploying over 50 people locally, Sainsbury’s is an important part of our local economy, which I’m sure will continue to represent a positive force for the constituency.\nI was certainly pleased to see their engagement with Bexhill Heritage earlier this year allowing for the successful renovation of Bexhill’s concrete mural, and the introduction an information display plaque.\nAnd a small reminder, as we move into the festive season, that those working in retail over the Christmas period are helping to make sure we have the best time possible - so please make sure to show kindness to employees, even when things don't go quite as planned.\nCancer Research UK Reception\nLast week Cancer Research UK held their Parliamentary Drop-in session, which saw almost 100 volunteer Campaigns Ambassadors from across the UK attend to speak with MPs about the cancer issues which they have identified as most significant.\nAs part of this, representatives were there to guide us MPs on how we can best access Cancer Research UK’s resources and expertise to aid constituents who are themselves suffering from cancer or are caring for a loved one who is.\nOne of the stands served as a good reminder that smoking is still a leading cause of cancers in the UK. As you can see from the photo, a 20 cigarette a day smoker will inhale a mug's worth of tar each year!\nIt is so important that we as a society help those smokers who want to quit, which is why the last Government substantially increased funding for stop smoking services in England, adding an additional £70 million a year to be provided over the next five years, expanding local delivered services.\nI’m hopeful that the current Government will continue to support crucial charities like Cancer Research UK as they continue their incredible work supporting all those impacted by cancer.\nScam Awareness\nAs a last part to this weeks newsletter I wanted to share some advice on how people can be scam aware.\nLast week was Scam Awareness Week, an important annual event dedicated to helping people spot and avoid scams, share their experiences, and feel empowered to report fraudulent activity.\nAs scammers become more sophisticated, it's essential we stay informed and confident in recognising and avoiding their tactics. Reporting scams not only protects us, but also helps prevent others from falling victim.\nCitizens Advice has shared three simple tips to help you stay safe:\n- Don’t rush into financial decisions—even if the deal seems too good to miss. Scammers often create a sense of urgency.\n- Never share personal or bank details immediately—take time to verify the legitimacy of the offer.\n- If in doubt, check the Financial Services Register—this can confirm whether a company or individual is genuine.\nStay alert, stay informed, and let’s work together to protect our community from scams. If you suspect a scam, don’t hesitate to report it.",

This important week in the local tourism calendar is a great way to celebrate and publicise all that the Bexhill and Battle constituency has to offer to both residents and tourists.\nThe visitor economy is really important to the constituency. In Sussex, tourism and hospitality accounts for 14% of all jobs and is worth £5 billion to the local economy. We have some real historic gems in our area which attract local residents and visitors including the National Trust properties of Bodiam Castle and Bateman’s – the former home of Rudyard Kipling, as well as English Heritage managed properties -Battle Abbey and Pevensey Castle which bring to life the Battle of 1066. I’ve had the pleasure of visiting all of these fantastic sites.\nAs well as these well-known properties which welcome visitors from all over the world, our area is filled with great places for visitors to enjoy. These include the iconic De La Warr Pavilion, galleries, museums, vineyards and wineries, craft breweries, restaurants, pubs and cafes. The list is endless and on top of all this there are beautiful seafronts and beaches to enjoy in Bexhill, Normans Bay and Pevensey as well as the most wonderful countryside to enjoy across Rother and the High Weald.\nCelebrating all that this area has to offer helps to drive a sense of place and positivity which brings further investment and boosts the local economy. Hundreds of dynamic and exciting businesses are already located in this area and next Friday 21 March over 50 of these will be exhibiting at the Bexhill Jobs and Apprenticeships Fair at the De La Warr Pavilion. I am proud to be part of the organising team for this event which last year attracted over 700 visitors looking for employment, training or volunteering opportunities.\nThe Jobs Fair welcomes people of all ages including those taking their first steps on the career ladder, looking to return to work after a break, considering a career change or just interested in the wide range of work and training opportunities on offer in the area. There will be employers from sectors including Hospitality, Construction, Financial Services, Transport, Education, Health & Social Care, Tourism, Creative Industries, Manufacturing, Engineering and many more. In addition, there will be free workshops including confidence boosting sessions for job-seekers, advice for young people interested in a freelance creative career, Google workshops on career goals and on growing your business brand. Littlegate Farm will be running a session for employers on developing diverse talent through apprenticeships and the Bexhill Chamber of Commerce will also be running a free CV checking service.\nThe Jobs Fair is often a busy and bustling day so there will also be a Quiet Time between 2pm and 3.30pm for visitors with access requirements or who would feel more comfortable in a quieter environment.\nThe Bexhill Jobs and Apprenticeships Fair is a not for profit event, led by community-based organisations including the De La Warr Pavilion, Bexhill College, Rother District Council and my office. It could not happen without the generous sponsors. This year, the key sponsors are Bexhill College, Greymoor Construction Ltd, Hastings Direct, TE Connectivity, Ashdown Hurrey, Bexhill Chamber Of Commerce, Care At Home Services (South East) and Pride Community Healthcare. My thanks go to all of the sponsors for their generosity in supporting this event.\nMore information about the day, including a full list of exhibitors and how to pre-register to attend and join the free workshops can be found on the De La Warr Pavilions website www.dlwp.com/jobsfair.\nJobs Fair photo credit: Burst Photos",
  "https_www_drkieranmullan_org_uk_/https_www_drkieranmullan_org_uk_news_kieran-visits-bexhill-community-diagnostic-centre-and-hospital/content_74.html": "Dr Kieran Mullan, MP for Bexhill and Battle, has thanked East Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust for a tour of Bexhill Community Diagnostic Centre and Bexhill Hospital last week.\nThe new Community Diagnostic Centre in Bexhill is already proving to be hugely productive, thanks to the dedication of its staff. Residents may remember that the site was previously a car showroom—an incredible example of NHS innovation in action.\nBexhill Hospital, built in 1933 following one of the deepest recessions in history, continues to serve the community thanks to the efforts of its staff. Kieran met with Clinical Site Manager, Lesley, who gave a tour of the Eye Surgery Centre, including the new Dowling Unit, named after John Dowling, chairman of the Bexhill Hospital League of Friends, who helped secure funding for it.\nDuring the visit, Kieran also had the opportunity to sit down with John and Bridget from the League of Friends, a dedicated community group that has raised nearly £3 million over the past decade for vital hospital upgrades—funding everything from MRI scanners to waiting room chairs.\nCommenting on the League of Friend’s work, Kieran said \"The League of Friends is the backbone of community support for Bexhill Hospital, turning generosity into real, life-changing improvements. Meeting John and Bridget, and hearing about the millions they’ve raised, was a powerful reminder of what local dedication can achieve.\"\nA tour of the Irvine Unit provided insight into how staff work alongside patients and their families to deliver personalised rehabilitation, helping to increase independence and improve quality of life. Despite the challenges of working in an ageing hospital, staff continue to create a welcoming and supportive environment for patients.\nThere was also serious discussion about the Labour Government’s decision to delay the rebuild of hospitals across East Sussex, including Bexhill Hospital. Originally scheduled under the New Hospitals Programme to be completed by 2030, these rebuilds are now delayed until at least 2039.\nWith a £410 million maintenance backlog, including £160 million in critical infrastructure repairs, staff made it clear that urgent funding is needed to maintain services while waiting for the rebuilds to begin.\nFollowing the visit, Kieran said:\n\"Having worked as an NHS doctor for years, hospitals and healthcare will always be a top priority for me. I will continue working with East Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust to ensure they get the funding they need to keep delivering first-class care to patients in Bexhill and Battle.\"",

When we lose water supplies, life becomes really difficult. This is what happened to residents in Hurst Green, Robertsbridge and Bodiam last week when a water main burst. I got in touch with South East Water to find out when water would be restored and what was being done to help residents access fresh water in the meantime.\nThe actions by SE Water to repair were swift but I had to get involved to ensure water supplies were accessible for all residents. Whilst those with vulnerabilities can apply to a priority register for bottled water supply to the doorstep, everyone else required a car to get to a pickup point on the A21. I know that rural communities rally round to support each other but it is the job of our water companies to ensure that water collection points are sited at convenient points within the villages which have lost water. I have therefore asked SE Water for a meeting to discuss how they can better respond to water loss emergencies in future. I will be inviting local councillors to feed into this conversation as their local knowledge is key.\nTalking of water, each time I travel back to the constituency and see the sea appear on the horizon, I feel so excited and lucky to be the MP for this beautiful area. The sea and beaches are not only a great public amenity but are an important part of the local economy. I was there delighted to see that Rother District Council has been awarded the Seaside Award from Keep Britain Tidy for Bexhill and Normans Bay beaches and flags are proudly flying to show this. It’s really important that we achieve the same high standard for the bathing water quality. Everyone knows the problems we have been having with sewage and it's a priority for me to secure progress on this. I have set up meetings with both the Environment Agency and Southern Water and I will keep residents updated with information and progress.",

With regards to crime, shop-lifting, drug dealing and speeding have been the key issues which are regularly raised with him, so these were top of the agenda for the meeting with the District Commander.\nKieran and Simon discussed latest initiatives from Sussex Police to cut down on business crime and bring offenders to justice. They agreed to work collaboratively to help tackle these issues.\nFollowing the meeting Kieran said:\n“It was good to meet with Chief Inspector Simon Yates from Sussex Police recently.\n“As a former volunteer policeman and someone who has campaigned for an improved criminal justice system that puts victims first, ensuring I work closely with Sussex Police is important to me. My plan is to meet regularly to discuss some of the common concerns I hear about – this time speeding, anti-social behaviour, drug dealing and shoplifting. I want to ensure they know what issues you are raising with me.\n“CI Yates and I will be agreeing plans of action that help turn words into actions. This time we agreed a joint focus to encourage retailers to report shoplifting with a commitment to arrest and charge whenever the evidence allows. This should work in conjunction with the newly formed Business Crime Partnership (BCP) for Rother District DISC system (a secure app for information-sharing and reporting business crime and anti-social behaviour) which is about to be launched. We also agreed to identify some further locations for possible Community Speedwatch initiatives. Even the most well-resourced police can’t be everywhere all at once and sadly worrying speeding is widespread. I would encourage anyone who is concerned by this to think about volunteering to help if they want to help make their local roads safer.”\nFor further information on Community Speedwatch https://sussexsaferroads.gov.uk/safer-speed/community-involvement/community-speedwatch/\nIn photo: Kieran Mullan MP talking to CI Simon Yates, Sussex Police, Hastings and Rother District Commander",

The closure, despite overwhelming opposition from the local community, has sparked concern among residents and businesses in Bexhill.\nIn response to the decision, Kieran Mullan MP stated:\n\"It is deeply disappointing to hear that Post Office has decided to close the Devonshire Square DMB despite the clear opposition from the local community, shown by 4,190 signatures on the ‘Save Bexhill Post Office’ petition. This decision disregards the needs and concerns of Bexhill residents and has been badly handled by the Post Office as we aren’t clear about what comes next.”\n“The Post Office have pledged to setup a franchise branch instead – but at this stage we don’t know when this will happen, where it will be and what services it will provide.”\n\"The closure of the Devonshire Square branch, and the proposed transition to a franchisee, leaves many questions unanswered. It is vital that Post Office Ltd provides clear, formal guarantees on location, services, and operational continuity before the branch is shut down.\"\n“It seemed to me that this decision was a foregone conclusion, so I have been trying to get guarantees out of the Post Office on ensuring any branch is in the heart of Bexhill and provides the same services we get now. We have made some progress, but we aren’t where we need to be.”\n“I will carry on pushing the Post Office to try and get the best out of this situation and thank everyone again for their support for the campaign.”\n“We at least have the positive news about the plans for a banking hub in Bexhill which will provide reassurance to people that at least vital banking services will be maintained in the heart of the town. I met with the team delivering the hub just today to start discussions about what we need in Bexhill.”",

Firstly, they have cut the Winter Fuel Payment for around 10 million pensioners, representing losses of up to £300 for the people affected by this policy.\nThis is wrong, and a total departure from the previous Government’s position that all pensioners must be afforded dignity and respect in retirement, leading me to have deep concerns about the Government’s future plans for pensioners.\nThe last Government successfully delivered around 11.9 million Winter Fuel Payments and Pensioner Cost of Living Payments to older people across the UK in December 2023.\nBeing an MP in a constituency which has a sizable pensioner population, I am against this decision. It has been a long-standing challenge to ensure everyone entitled claims Pension Credit. It is now more important than ever that we raise awareness amongst our friends, family and community members.\nI know how it will impact so many pensioners across the country. I think it is clear to all of us that cutting much needed winter fuel payments to pensioners is the wrong choice of the new government.\nAt the same time, new housing targets have been set in a way that seem completely out of touch with local realities.\nAngela Rayner's new planning rules aim for 1.5 million homes by 2029, but the targets have been wrongly distributed across the country.\nIn our area, Rother District's target jumped from 727 to 880 annually. Keep in mind an average of 281 homes were completed per year from 2020 to 2023. This new target isn't realistic and will let developers run wild when it isn't met. 83% of the land is designated as Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). An unadjusted national target was never going to fit for us.\nOn this, Councillor John Barnes, MBE, commented: “Even if we urgently redouble our search for sites and think about one new village, I do not see how this is do-able, even were the building industry and housing associations able to build at that rate… The threat to the AONB is very real and the Government needs to be forced to consider whether the land supply formula needs to be altered for areas like ours where more than four fifths of the area is protected.”\nIn contrast, London's housing target was cut by 20% despite a severe shortage and skyrocketing prices. In the North East, where demand is low, Redcar's target rise by 1,337% and Blackpool's by 330%. Our neighbours in Hastings will see their target rise from 490 to 722.\nRe-designating parts of the green belt land as \"grey belt\" also threatens vital protections against urban sprawl. I suspect they are choosing to build new homes in these areas because it is an easier way for the Government to meet targets rather than people’s needs.\nLocal councils lack the support needed to meet these unrealistic targets. Building in low-demand areas could depress house prices and strain local economies. A balanced approach that protects the environment and meets genuine housing needs is crucial.\nBoth decisions show a government that’s prioritising numbers over people’s actual needs. We need to push back and demand a more thoughtful and informed approach to these issues.",

  "https_www_drkieranmullan_org_uk_/https_www_drkieranmullan_org_uk_news_supporting-local-gps-will-be-one-my-top-priorities/content_73.html": "The great thing about Parliamentary summer recess is that I have been able to get out and about across the constituency to learn more about the local issues, local businesses and organisations which support my constituents.\nLast week, I visited a GP surgery in Battle to hear about the challenges they face looking after their 8,500 patients from historic high street premises which restrict the services they can offer. They are not alone, other GP practices in the area also need to move to better facilities in order to deliver a wider range of primary care and diagnostic services for local residents. Many GP practices are keen to become ‘training practices’ to support our next generation of GPs. They would have no shortage of applicants, being well-run surgeries, but they hampered by their facilities.\nSupporting local GPs to relocate to premises which are fit for purpose is going to be one of my key local priorities. A Conservative manifesto pledge at the last election was to set up a fund to specifically deliver new GP facilities and healthcare centres. I will be asking the new Government how they intend to support new facilities for GP practices as the current system does not work.\nAs well as meeting local GPs, I visited Little Gate Farm in Beckley, a supported employment charity, helping young people and adults with learning disabilities and autism into the workplace and careers. They have had great success so far and are about to launch a new College in Bexhill. To support their students into work, they are looking for local employers to offer internships and work experience placements for their students. I have offered my support to help them with this.\nFinally, I got to learn more about our local wine industry and its importance to the economy when I visited Oxney Organic Estate. Owner Kristin Syltevik gave me a tour of the vineyard and soon to be expanded winery. We have several vineyards in the Bexhill and Battle constituency creating new jobs in this rapidly growing sector. Vineyards play an increasingly important role in the local tourism industry. By 2040 it is estimated that Sussex Wine tourism will have a £283m impact on the local economy and support over 3600 new jobs. I am therefore keen to support this key local industry.",
  "https_www_drkieranmullan_org_uk_/https_www_drkieranmullan_org_uk_news_my-recent-visit-british-gypsum/content_70.html": "Earlier this month, I visited British Gypsum’s impressive site near Robertsbridge, a true cornerstone of East Sussex’s economy and a vital local employer.\nThe sheer scale of the operation is striking, and it was a pleasure to meet some of the dedicated team and witness firsthand the diverse and skilled career paths it offers. It’s my job as your MP to understand the work of our local employers big and small so I can raise issues that are relevant to them in my work representing the constituency.\nWhat truly stood out was the breadth of opportunities, spanning engineering and manufacturing to crucial roles in logistics, safety, and research. It was inspiring to meet individuals who have built fulfilling, long-term careers at the site, a testament to the company’s commitment to its local workforce and the potential for professional growth without leaving the area.\nMy visit also offered a unique perspective – the chance to descend hundreds of feet underground into the Brightling mine. This was a highlight, revealing a fascinating and highly technical operation with a clear dedication to environmental care and sustainability. Witnessing the source of this essential material firsthand provided a powerful insight.\nIt’s easy to overlook just how fundamental gypsum is to the construction industry. Produced at the Robertsbridge site, this naturally occurring mineral lines the walls and ceilings of our homes, offices, hospitals, and schools across the UK. Without it, much of modern building as we know it simply wouldn’t be possible.\nWhat makes the Brightling site even more compelling is its deep roots in the county’s industrial heritage. The story of gypsum mining in East Sussex stretches back to the 19th century, with the discovery of the Mountfield mine in 1876 during geological drilling. This makes the area one of the earliest sites of gypsum extraction in Britain. Interestingly, the initial hope was to find coal, but it was later discovered to be the UK’s largest gypsum deposit, with reserves estimated for at least another 30 years.\nFrom those early beginnings, the industry expanded. By the 1890s, dozens worked at Mountfield, producing plaster. As gypsum’s uses grew, so did the operations. In 1973, the Robertsbridge site transitioned from plaster production to become a full wallboard manufacturing plant—today, a global leader in its field.\nWhile the Mountfield mine has since closed, the Brightling mine has been continuously extracting gypsum since the 1960s. At one point, up to 800,000 tonnes of gypsum a year were transported by a 4.7km conveyor to the Robertsbridge plant. Although production has scaled back in recent years, Brightling remains a crucial supplier for both construction and the cement industry.\nBritish Gypsum’s enduring presence in East Sussex is a powerful testament to the skill of the local workforce and the business’s adaptability. With career opportunities spanning decades and a constant drive for innovation, the Robertsbridge plant is more than just a significant employer; it is a cornerstone of East Sussex’s industrial story, a vital part of our past, present, and future.",

I have tried my best to hit the ground running - meeting with as many local groups as I can and taking up a variety of issues and campaigns. I also want to thank my team who have helped me respond to more than 4,000 emails, phone calls and letters. I have held a number of surgeries, raised issues in Parliament and tried to keep everyone up to date via Facebook and this newsletter. In my experience constituents know as an MP I can't always click my fingers to resolve problems but appreciate me doing my best.\nI would like to say thank you to everyone who has sent positive feedback on the newsletter. If you have friends or family whom you think would also enjoy receiving it in 2025, then please do forward this link for them to sign up - https://www.drkieranmullan.org.uk/.\nIn a development which might feel like Christmas come early for many local residents, the Home Office has confirmed that Northeye will not be used as an immigration accommodation site. I know this will be a relief for many – I’m pleased the Government has seen sense on this issue.\nJoined by a group of MPs, I met with Post Office CEO Neil Brocklehurst to quiz him about the potential closure of direct-run Post Office branches and as a result secured a further meeting to discuss our concerns in more detail. Every day more people sign our petition against the possible closure of the Bexhill Post Office,\nI was proud to showcase the winning design for my Christmas Card competition to the Speaker of the House of Commons, and also met Attlee, the Speaker’s cat. Congratulations again to Barnaby from Bodiam CE Primary on winning this year’s competition.\nLast week, I was grateful to speak in the Commons of the issue of removing VAT exemptions for private schools. I have been deeply concerned by the rhetoric coming from this Labour Government and felt it was important to personally raise the vindictive nature of their argument for this policy.\nSpeaking of devastating policy implications, I joined fellow MPs earlier this week in advance of the Stop The Family Farm Tax petition being handed into Number 10. It has gathered over 200,000 signatures, showing just how unpopular this decision is. We will continue our campaign against and make sure ours and farmers voices are heard.\nA couple of weekends ago I was pleased to take the opportunity of leading discussions between National Highways and local councillors in Robertsbridge on the latest changes to speed limits on the A21 and planned further changes.\nI also joined the Hooe Village Community Group to hear more about the residents are doing to make a difference in their community. In small rural communities like these where there are sizeable farming presence, its always insightful to hear more about how Labours Family Farms Tax is going to impact them.\nLater I visited the Royal Mail delivery office to thank them on behalf of everyone for the hard work they are doing, especially during such a busy season! Their work truly does help make Christmas for everyone.\nIn Parliament, I have been pleased to attend a number of events over the past couple of weeks including speaking with representatives from the Independent Pharmacy Association to discuss the growing concern about the impact of medicine shortages in the UK.\nI also went to the re-formation of the Tidy Britain APPG, which is looking to further support litter picking groups, as well as other worthwhile causes. I know we have some amazing litter pick groups across the constituency which I have been able to join, so a huge thank you to everyone who helps out!\nAnd Alzheimer’s Research UK held their parliamentary drop-in to raise awareness around dementia research and funding. It is so important that everyone living with dementia gets a formal diagnosis so they can access treatments and the support they need. I will continue to support Alzheimer’s UK and their efforts to find a cure moving forward.\nIn the constituency I joined representatives from the Environment Agency and members of the Pevensey Bay Coastal Community Group, to review plans for managing coastal erosion going forward.\nIt was great to see the Bexhill Choral Society at their Christmas concert earlier this month. Incredible performance with some Christmas classics! If you haven’t already, do look out to go along to one of their performances as they do concerts all year round!\nLastly, a reminder on two fronts.\nThe Pension Credit deadline – Saturday 21st December – is tomorrow. With the Labour Government’s decision on Winter Fuel Payments, I urge everyone who thinks they may be eligible to sign up before the deadline.\nAnd, with quite literally the cold season upon us, the NHS has seen a surge of people in England step up to book their winter vaccines. Vaccines are our strongest defence against flu and COVID-19, so please do take advantage and get your jab now.\nOf course my party losing the election earlier this year was difficult and we have got to work hard next year to earn back trust. But I think people are seeing that the Labour Party got in on the back of multiple promises that they haven't kept. Governing is not easy and there are no easy answers to the challenges we face as a country. Just trade offs. So far they are making many of the wrong ones. I hope they don't carry on at the same rate or we are going to hit even more difficulties next year.\nWhatever happens I will keep speaking up for my constituents on the issues that matter to them and try and make a difference locally.\nMerry Christmas & Happy New Year!\nHave a great weekend.\nThis week's newsletter:\n- Northeye - No Longer Going Ahead\n- Post Office Ltd Drop-in\n- Christmas Card Showcase\n- VAT on Private Schools\n- Stop The Family Farm Tax Petition\n- National Highways\n- Hooe Village Community Group\n- Visit to Royal Mail in Battle\n- Independent Pharmacy Association Drop-in\n- Tidy Britain APPG\n- Alzheimer's Research UK\n- Pevensey Bay Coastal Defence Meeting\n- Bexhill Choral Society\n- Pension Credit Deadline - Saturday 21st December\n- Protect Yourself and Support the NHS: Book Your Winter Vaccines!\nNortheye - No Longer Going Ahead\nI know residents will join me in welcoming the government’s decision not to proceed with an immigration accommodation site at Northeye in Bexhill.\nI want to thank campaigners, and cross-party councillors across all layers of local government for fighting against this plan. I'm especially pleased for the residents of the Northeye Estate for whom the uncertainty and worry is now over.\nPost Office Ltd Drop-in\nLast week I, alongside a number of MPs concerned by the potential closure of direct-run Post Office Branches, attended the Post Office drop-in event in Parliament.\nIn advance of this, a cross-party group of MPs, including myself, signed a letter voicing our concerns at the recent announcement and agreed to attend the drop-in together to directly query many of the unknowns, due to a lack in transparency by Post Office Ltd.\nAs a result, Post Office has agreed to a further meeting with those MPs who would like to engage and will be providing a timeline for their overall plans moving forward, including dates for public consultations, as this has yet to be shared.\nThis further meeting will come following the one I secured with the Minister responsible for the Post Office in PMQs and will serve as an effective follow-up.\nDo keep an eye out for any further updates and if you haven’t already, please do sign the petition through the following link here.\nChristmas Card Showcase\nThe Christmas Card competition is one of the highlights of my year! It was a proud moment showcasing the winning design to the Speaker of the House of Commons! I'll also be sending one of my cards to His Majesty the King.\nIt was also great to meet the Speaker's cat, Attlee! The Speaker's House was done up beautifully for Christmas as well!\nCongratulations again to Barnaby from Bodiam CE Primary on winning this year’s competition. As he won first place, Bodiam CE Primary will be awarded £100 for creative arts supplies for the whole school, courtesy of Blackbrooks Garden Centre.\nWell done also to our two runners up, Thea from Burwash CE Primary, and Hope from St Mary's Special School, who have both won £50 for their schools to spend on art supplies.\nThank you again to Blackbrooks Garden Centres for sponsoring this year’s competition, and to all the schools who entered and made the competition a success!\nVAT on Private Schools\nAs the vast majority of people send their children to state schools, you might think the VAT on private schools is something that only a small number of people would be concerned about. You might even think it’s a good idea as the Government has said it will bring more money into state schools.\nBut last week, I spoke out in Parliament about the deeply concerning rhetoric the Labour Government has used talking about this issue.\nThe way they have pitted parent against parent, schoolchild against schoolchild, is simply shameful.\nTo imply that parents who choose to send their children to private school are somehow depriving state educated pupils of resources is deliberately misleading. They know this is not how tax is allocated in this country and are clearly trying to foster resentment.\nAll our tax money goes into one big pot and the Government spends a trillion pounds a year. It doesn't need to blame private school parents for decisions about funding in state schools.\nBexhill and Battle is home to 4 private schools, Frewen College, Battle Abbey School, Vinehall School, and Claremont School. They aren't villains or people to be blamed. I would like to see the Government reconsider this attack on personal choice and the resentment they are fostering.\nEven if you don't send your children to private school, I think people know it’s nothing to try and generate bad feeling about.\nStop The Family Farm Tax Petition\nEarlier this week, I joined with fellow MPs to continue our campaign against this Labour Government’s Family Farm Tax, which will have dire consequences for so many small family farms across the country.\nIt was an important day as we handed in the ‘Stop The Family Farm Tax’ petition to the Government, which more than 200,000 people have signed over the past couple of months, showing just how unpopular this decision is!\nI was pleased to meet Bella, who is eleven and daughter of a small farm owner. She kindly stood with us as part of the protest, marking the generational impact this policy decision will have.\nI was pleased to chat with Bella’s parents for a while and hear about their concerns for the future. They were clear that this tax would make it financially inviable to pass their farm onto Bella and her sister, who both want to continue the long history of farming in their family.\nIt was great to see party leader Kemi Badenoch also attend and show how farmers across the UK have the full support of the Conservative Party.\nWe will continue our campaign against and make sure ours and farmers voices are heard.\nNational Highways\nAs some of you will likely be aware, the A21 Road Safety package is a c£20m programme of work being carried out by National Highways to improve the safety of this vitally important trunk road which links the constituency to London and the M25.\nSome of National Highways proposals for the section of road at Robertsbridge have been questioned by the local community so I organised a meeting for councillors, National Highways and the Sussex Road Safety Partnership.\nWe had some very good discussions and a commitment from National Highways to carry out further work and consultation on their proposals as well as regular reviews of measures already installed to assess their effectiveness in improving road safety.\nHooe Village Community Group\nIt was great to pop in to St Oswald's Church for the Hooe Village Community Group coffee morning and enjoy some delicious home baked sausage rolls and cake! Thanks to Elaine, Pam and all the other volunteers that run the morning.\nI got to chat with the amazing Anne about the village community library service she stewards (and who gave me permission to say she is 91!).\nI also spoke to Robert Smith from Holmes Farm who's family have farmed locally for generations but who will not be able to pass on the farm to his children as a result of Labours Family Farm Tax. Anne is also the matriarch of a local farming family and was equally concerned.\nFind out more about the work of the group online:\nhttps://www.hooevillagecommunitygroup.co.uk\nVisit to Royal Mail in Battle\nIt was great to pop into the Royal Mail delivery office in Battle to say thank you to all our postmen and women who are working extra hard over Christmas to deliver our presents and Christmas Cards.\nI thanked them on behalf of all my constituents and of course send our gratitude to posties across the constituency!\nAlso gave me a chance to see the beautiful Battle Christmas tree in all its glory - though I'm sure it's even better lit up at night!\nIndependent Pharmacy Association Drop-in\nEarlier this month, I attended an event hosted by the Independent Pharmacy Association to discuss growing concern about the impact of medicine shortages on patient care in the UK.\nThe core issues driving these shortages are global supply chain disruptions and pricing challenges, meaning there is greater incentive for pharmaceutical companies to sell to other countries before us.\nThis of course is not unique to the UK, other countries have experienced shortages over recent years, but restrictive NHS contracts prevent pharmacies from varying to alternative suppliers should they experience a shortage.\nIt was great to hear about their proposals to mitigate and manage shortages, including: enforcing penalties on suppliers that fail to meet the terms of their NHS contracts, cutting red tape to give pharmacists more power to make minor changes to prescriptions, and better collaboration across the medicine supply chain to give the NHS more prompt notice of supply issues.\nIn light of this, I recently wrote to the Secretary of State for Health to ask what the Department was planning to do to mitigate medicine shortages going forward and what assessment the Department had made of allowing pharmacies to vary to alternatives if available.\nI look forward to hearing from the Minister soon.\nTidy Britain APPG\nIn Bexhill and Battle there are several great litter picking groups that I have had the pleasure of joining on their outings since I became the MP. A big shout out to the Little Commoners, Bexhill Environmental Group, Jesus Loves Bexhill and all the other litter picking groups in my constituency.\nIt would be wonderful if these groups did not have to exist because people didn't drop litter, and I support more effective enforcement. But I cannot say enough how much I respect and wish to support those who do give up their time and energy to help tackle this problem. For me, it's symbolic of how we can all play our part in helping our local communities.\nIn this vein, I recently attended the re-formation of the Tidy Britian APPG, who are a cross-party group of MPs and Peers looking to further support litter picking groups, as well as some other worthwhile causes, such as reducing plastic pollution and fly-tipping.\nI am looking forward to working with the group on behalf of all the litter picking groups in my constituency.\nAlzheimer's Research UK\nLast week, I attended Alzheimer's Research UK's reception to raise awareness around dementia research and funding.\nThere are currently estimated to be around 982,000 people living with dementia in the UK, with Bexhill and Battle is home to an estimated 2,050 of those. This puts us in the top 100 constituencies with the most people battling this disease.\nThis year marked a historic milestone with the licensing of two new Alzheimer’s drugs in Britain - Lecanemab and Donanemab. These are the first to be licensed in over 20 years!\nWhile these treatments are not cures, and carry risks, they are the first to slow the progression of memory and thinking decline caused by Alzheimer’s.\nIf you or anyone you know is suffering with dementia, there are a number of charities that can offer advice and support. Admiral Nurses can offer support to people with dementia and provide their families with practical advice. You can contact them via 0800 888 6678. Further, the Alzheimer's Society can put you in touch with local support groups and can be contacted via 0300 150 3456.\nI'm keen to ensure everyone living in Bexhill and Battle with dementia gets a formal diagnosis, and can access the treatments and support they need. I will continue to support Alzheimer's UK's efforts to find a cure going forward.\nPevensey Bay Coastal Defence Meeting\nIt was great to meet with Andy Walker and Nick Gray of the Environment Agency, and members of the Pevensey Bay Coastal Community Group to review plans for managing coastal erosion going forward.\nThere will be a new short-term contract starting next year ahead of a new medium-term plan starting in 2027, backed with £110 million of funding to protect coastal communities from flooding.\nThe residents have done an excellent job of working with the EA to give reassurance to everyone living in Pevensey, and the surrounding area, that there is a robust plan in place. I will of course support them in carrying on with this work on behalf of our local communities.\nThe details of the new approach will be decided in coming months and then will be shared so residents can see for themselves how the EA plan to manage the beach in coming years.\nBexhill Choral Society\nI was grateful to attend a beautiful Christmas concert earlier this month by Bexhill Choral Society, with Louisa Alice-Rose and Cinque Ports Brass. You'll see some excerpts linked in the video above!\nIt was great to chat with some of the members after the performance - incredible voices. They have a schedule of concerts all year round, so don't miss out!\nPension Credit Deadline - Saturday 21st December\nWinter Fuel Payments have been afforded to pensioners across the country since 1997, with each successive Government committing to it. The current Government now wants to remove this crucial lifeline. I have been vocal in my opposition of this proposal and will continue to fight against this decision.\nThe deadline for Pension Credit applications is on Saturday 21st December, and I urge everyone who thinks they may be eligible to sign up before the deadline so they can continue to receive the Winter Fuel Allowance.\nThe average Pension Credit award is worth over £3,900 per year and it opens doors to other support, like help with housing costs, council tax and heating bills.\nIf you or anyone you know might be eligible, make sure to submit an application straight away.\nStaff at the Department of Work and Pensions can help you with your application.\nCall 0800 99 1234 to submit and application before the deadline on Saturday 21st Dec.\nProtect Yourself and Support the NHS: Book Your Winter Vaccines!\nLast week, thousands more people in England stepped up to book their winter vaccines after the NHS warned of a looming \"tidal wave\" of flu and other seasonal viruses.\nIn just one day, flu and COVID-19 vaccination appointments skyrocketed by 124%, jumping from 9,452 on Wednesday to 21,144 on Thursday.\nVaccines are our strongest defence against these viruses, helping to protect not only ourselves but also our communities and the NHS during this critical season. Currently, health experts are worried about the number of people across the South East who might not have their annual flu jab this winter.\nEligible people in England can now book their flu and Covid-19 vaccines through the NHS.\nFor specific information on booking a free NHS flu vaccination, click here.\nFor COVID-19 vaccination appointments, click here.\nAnd for more information, read the following BBC News article here.",
  "https_www_drkieranmullan_org_uk_/https_www_drkieranmullan_org_uk_news_my-column-bexhill-and-battle-observer-assisted-dying-historical-vote/content_48.html": "As I write this column, I am preparing for an historical moment in Parliament as the day this column is published (Friday) MPs will be debating and voting on assisted dying. This year, a Private Member’s Bill has been introduced to legalise assisted dying by backbench Labour MP Kim Leadbeater. Private Members Bills are not government-led. This bill, if passed, would give someone expected to die within six months the right to choose to end their own life with medical help. I know from the size of my postbag that this is a really important issue for my constituents and has impacts for individuals, families and those working in health and palliative care.\nThe last time a Bill on assisted dying was presented to Parliament was in 2015, before I became an MP. At that time, after a long and passionate debate, MPs voted 330 to 118 against changing the law.\nMPs are always expected to have strong opinions on everything and the media often portrays politics as black and white, right and wrong. This is often not true and is particularly the case when it comes to assisted dying. I can understand and sympathise with both those wanting to ease the suffering of the terminally ill and those worried about what this might mean for society as a whole and particularly some vulnerable older people. I have yet to make up my mind on how I will vote.\nI am therefore carefully considering all the correspondence I have received from individuals and organisations and whilst I can’t speak to everyone, I am due to hear directly from some of the constituents that have contacted me before I decide how to vote. Whatever the outcome I think it is important we respect the different opinions on this issue as sincerely held. Everyone contacting me about this issue is doing so through a desire to see what they think is right achieved.\nLocally, shortly after I submitted my last column, I learnt that Post Office Ltd was considering closing 115 directly-run Post Offices branches as part of a process of transformation. This list includes the Bexhill Post Office in Devonshire Square, which is directly run by the Post Office and provides specialised services which cannot currently be provided at smaller branches. This closure wouldn’t just impact Bexhill residents but also those in more rural areas who need access to the more specialised services. I was immediately concerned about what sort of impact this would have on the town residents and businesses and I wanted to ensure that our voice would be heard early in the decision-making process. I was particularly concerned by the fact that 4 major high street banks have now left Bexhill and when doing so promised their customers that most of their day-to-day banking transactions could be carried out by the Post Office. So if the Post Office closes too, what then?\nIn order to gauge public opinion and to make effective representation to government and Post Office Ltd, I set up a petition ‘Save Bexhill Post Office’ on my website and shared it on social media. The response has been incredible with over 3000 signatories already and people have also written to me to share their strong views and genuine concerns for the town, businesses and our most vulnerable residents. For those who cannot sign online, I’ll be at outside the Post Office at 9am on Saturday 30 November gathering more signatories with the help of your local councillors and the Bexhill Chamber of Commerce. I hope to see you there.",
  "https_www_drkieranmullan_org_uk_/https_www_drkieranmullan_org_uk_news_supporting-our-farmers-essential-uk-food-security/content_82.html": "I have spent a lot of my time getting out and about in the constituency since being elected as MP for Bexhill and Battle. I certainly cover some distance on my travels to see people and places as constituency covers around 200 square miles - from Pevensey and Herstmonceux in the west, to Brede, Westfield and Northiam in the east, from Bexhill in the south to Flimwell which the northernmost part of the constituency. Around half of my constituents live in the towns of Bexhill and Battle but the remainder live in rural areas and villages. Around 90% of the constituency is either in the High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) or a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) such as the Pevensey levels. Rural issues, agricultural and the environment are therefore very important to the constituency.\nSupporting our local farmers and protecting the rural environment is an important part of my job. Having met the National Farmers Union (NFU) at Parliament in September on ‘Back British Farming Day’, I then organised to meet with local members of the NFU at a dairy farm in Herstmonceux to learn more about the challenges local farmers face. I was keen to know how I can support them and work with them to ensure that government funding and regulation supports them to produce food as well as looking after the environment.\nSince leaving the EU, we can now decide ourselves how we support farmers in this country instead of using a scheme that was mainly designed with French farmers in mind . We are moving away from payments, largely based on the area of land farmed, towards a new focus on providing public goods, such as environmental and animal health improvements. I was interested to learn from the farmers whether the new funding schemes have now got the balance right between environmental land management and supporting food production.\nThe UK currently produces 62% of the food it consumes. This is considered a relatively stable figure according to the national Food Security Index but recent global events, such as Covid 19 and the war in Ukraine, have demonstrated that the UK’s reliance on global markets for food and energy make us particularly vulnerable to the risk of food price inflation. This year, farmers and growers have also experienced some of the wettest winters and springs on record and this has put great pressure on food production. Events which impact the UK’s food security and make it challenging for people to access sufficient healthy and safe food means it’s very important that the UK government supports our farmers and food producers to make sure we remain resilient.\nIt was therefore very helpful to meet local farmers to hear about the challenges and opportunities they face. It was clear that they are as passionate about food production as they are about ensuring biodiversity and careful land management. The impression I was left with was that, at the moment, the balance probably isn’t quite right – that it is putting farmers off from farming the land in favour of letting it rewild. I will continue to work with local farmers and the NFU to ensure that the UK’s farm subsidy schemes work for their businesses and that the focus of farming remains about producing home grown food and ensuring UK food security.",
  "https_www_drkieranmullan_org_uk_/https_www_drkieranmullan_org_uk_news_update-bexhill-post-office/content_43.html": "This week, other MPs and I met Post Office Ltd representatives to discuss the potential closure of the last Direct Managed Branches (DMB) in the UK, including the Post Office in Bexhill. This meeting included Nigel Railton, Interim Chair of Post Office Ltd, and Neil Brocklehurst, acting CEO.\nI was very disappointed with the meeting, as Post Office representatives didn’t even know what criteria they’d use to make their decision, even though a decision is expected in March.\nThey were also unaware of the challenges local businesses face with cash deposit services at sub-post offices compared to DMBs.\nMPs made it clear this wasn’t acceptable for us or our constituents. Post Office Ltd has promised another update next week, and I will work with other MPs to robustly hold them to account.\nIt was simply not good enough."
