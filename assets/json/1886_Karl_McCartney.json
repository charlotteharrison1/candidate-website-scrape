In fact, on Lincolnshire roads this year we have seen 20 more deaths than last year which is a statistic that needs urgent attention from us all and especially Highways England and the County Council.\nIndeed I am often bothering the County Council Highways Department with regard to worn out road markings that have a safety implication to all road and footpath users and need to be re-instated in and around my constituency.\nThe contribution of clear and safe road markings to road management can also never be ignored either, especially as the volume of traffic on our roads continues to increase and the greater need in a post-Brexit Britain to literally keep the Country moving and our economy growing.\nIt is vital that with the welcome extra road investment the Chancellor recently announced, that the road markings sector is allowed to make a key and central contribution. Eventually, should that day come with fully automated vehicles, road markings will be even more important than they are today, and indeed may not just contain relatively cheap paint, but technologically advanced guidance systems or aspects perhaps that assist such futuristic Bladerunner type vehicles. I don’t know which character in Bladerunner George, or myself, might like to be, but I, and you, may have a few ideas…\nI believe there is no point investing the taxes that road-users pay while not ensuring those roads that they, and you all and I, use are safe, and that any improvements in traffic flow through redesign improvements are temporary because road markings were not seen as being central to the investment’s success.\nOn the Select Committee, we have raised our concerns continually about safety. Personally I still have grave and to be frank, unanswered concerns about the expansion of All Lane Running on our motorways and the effects it will have on road safety. The Minister here today has no direct responsibility for this area, it is his colleague’s Bailiwick.\nIt is the Minister’s colleague, who along with his Whitehall Mandarins at our Select Committee crossed the proverbial central chevrons as far as I was concerned, and then were caught like rabbits in headlights as they suddenly realised that the Transport Select Committee, and myself particularly, did not buy into their sanitised sweetness and light view of motorway driving and All Lane Running.\nThe moral jury is still out on their decision to forge ahead, and despite blanket radio coverage of public information for drivers on the subject of how to use All Lane Running Motoways, I do not believe increasing capacity on the cheap is what a Government I am a part of should be involved in - in either the short term nor obviously the long term.\nThe Government in my view still seems reluctant to take those concerns we have raised seriously and runs the risk of needlessly causing more road causalities.\nHowever, if such changes do go ahead, the Government must ensure this Association and its members play an absolutely front and centre role in doing everything possible to improve safety. And at this point I would point out that I am sure the Minister of Transport, my esteemed colleague and fellow Lincolnshire Member of Parliament John Hayes is taking note! And possibly contemplating the promulgation of my views to his Ministerial colleagues and maybe the Whips’ Office too.\nOne other point if I may, to continue to make our Country a great success we need our companies to keep reinvesting in their existing staff and also to train new people – especially Apprentices.\nNow while it may not be fashionable or even politically correct to say so and those who know me know I have never been one to follow the Guardian’s worldview, but in the main these are the type of Apprenticeships and jobs that young men are more likely to be attracted to than young women, although of course we want opportunities open to all and when contemplating your areas of expertise I am sure there will be suitable avenues for the full spectrum of apprenticeships for both genders.\nFor far too long now physical outside jobs have been viewed as not as important nor as attractive as those in the service sector. Let us be clear they are as, if not more, important than many roles in the sector, particularly when viewed with safety goggles on…\nIn my eyes they provide a vital role in giving meaningful employment, careers and opportunities to many young men. In the transport sector as a whole, we on the Committee have taken evidence from the sector about the skills gap and while others such as in Highways England and the education sector should do more, I am glad that this Association and its members are playing a key role themselves.\nOn behalf of the Transport Select Committee who greatly value the work of the Association and its members for all road users in all four corners of the United Kingdom, I would like to thank you for everything that you do. I would also like to thankyou all at this reception for the support that you have given the Association and also your contributions to next Spring’s report on Making the Network Work.\nI would now like to introduce the Minister of Transport and my good friend and fellow Lincolnshire Member of Parliament, the Rt. Hon. John Hayes, to say a few words from the Government about the invaluable work of the Road Safety Markings Association.\nI hope many of you will have heard from the Minister before, if you have not you are in for a treat. There is, so I am told and reassured, no truth in the rumour that John was contemplating singing, or rather rapping, the opening verse and chorus to the Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five’s 1983 hit White Lines (Don’t Don’t Do it) which is a stone groove for any of us who love our dance and hip hop music… maybe it’s a good thing we are spared that today, but a wonderful mental image for us all to contemplate as I hand over to the Transport Minister…. A true rappers’ delight…",
  "https_www_karlmccartney_co_uk_/https_www_karlmccartney_co_uk_news_karl-welcomes-and-attends-opening-lincoln-high-street-footbridge/content_92.html": "Network Rail and Karl McCartney MP were today joined by representatives from Lincoln City Council and Lincolnshire County Council to celebrate the opening of the new footbridge over the level crossing at High Street.\nBefore the bridge opened the crossing was ranked as the highest risk for misuse in the region.\nThe crossing on High Street sees over 140 trains per day pass through; with the latest census report showing almost 35,000 pedestrians or cyclists use it every day. Worryingly, pedestrians are often seen running over the crossing once the lights sequence has begun and even when the barriers have started to lower, significantly increasing the risk of a safety incident. Now Network Rail is urging people to use the new footbridge and not to take a risk by using the crossing once the lights sequence as begun.\nKarl McCartney JP MP, Lincoln’s Member of Parliament, said: “I am delighted to have attended and played an integral part in the official opening of the High Street footbridge now that Network Rail have, at last, been able to complete this vital transport project that I pledged to deliver for Lincoln before I was first elected as our City’s Member of Parliament.\n“Level crossing safety and appropriate bridges have always been an issue I have campaigned on, but the High Street level crossing, in particular, was one of my key promises to the people of Lincoln and will be of huge benefit to the City.\n“Alongside the coming Brayford Wharf East footbridge and better direct rail services to London, Lincoln will soon be one of Britain’s most rail friendly cities for passengers, pedestrians and motorists alike - a very different situation to when I was first elected in 2010.\n“The missing pieces of the transport jigsaw in Lincoln are all coming together to create a joined up City, exactly what we need to take advantage of Lincoln’s thriving economy in the 21st Century.”\nThe bridge has been opened to the public as soon as possible in order to bring its benefits to the people of Lincoln. Finishing work will continue on site. In order to complete this safely the bridge will be closed overnight from 11pm to 5am for the next three weeks.\n- ENDS -\nFor further information, please contact Karl McCartney JP MP at [email protected] / 020 7219 7221.",

It was a hugely tough challenge selecting the winner from the wonderful designs from the ten bright and joyful designs that stood out. Anfisa not only showcased her talent for art, she also captured the Christmas spirit. My huge congratulations and my heartfelt thanks for all the hard work and thought she clearly put into the design.\n“Thank you also to all those who entered and sorry to those who were not chosen as winner or runners up this year – there were so many beautiful and heart-warming designs to choose from.

  "https_www_karlmccartney_co_uk_/https_www_karlmccartney_co_uk_news_four-questions-every-wannabe-prime-minister-needs-address-conservative-backbenchers/content_84.html": "Being in Parliament at this time, is both exciting and bears a heavy responsibility. Exciting because of the need to execute the decision made by the Great British public in the European Referendum last week and sadly the need for a new Prime Minister. And responsibility, because of the need to make the right decisions.\nIt is also a rare time, often for the only time, Conservative Backbenchers are the kingmakers. Within Parliament, many (not all) Backbenchers spend most of their time acting as if they are on “Parliament’s Got Talent” in the vain hope that at some time the wheel of political fortune will land on their number. Some flutter their eyes at the Whips, march through the Government Lobby come what may (extending Sunday Trading anyone?) and even during the Referendum debate, campaign for Remain despite being selected by their Associations on a clear Eurosceptic/Leave ticket. Some even changed sides on the eve of the Referendum when it looked like Remain would win just to improve their chances of being plucked from the supposed obscurity of the Commons Backbenches.\nThis time, the roles are reversed. William Hague said in the Daily Telegraph on Monday that “Each MP is besieged with calls, testing, probing, recruiting, as the candidates try to assemble a credible team of followers or decide, with as much grace as they can muster, to bestow their support on another.” It is certainly true, my mobile is permanently on charge and buzzing. Suddenly I am transformed from being a part of the audience (I was never one for fluttering my eyes at the Whips) to having Simon Cowell-like status. In fact, all Conservative Backbenchers can claim “We are all Simon Cowell now!”…but without the high waistbands.\nFor me as a Conservative Backbencher in a marginal seat, there are four questions that I will be asking all potential leadership candidates this week.\nMy first question relates to the outcome of the European Referendum and whether during their negotiations with the European Union, they are fully committed to asserting our National Sovereignty. This includes the issue of our borders, our economic trade and our Parliamentary Sovereignty as well as on other issues such as our fisheries, agriculture and taxation. The Great British people have spoken and they have given a clear message to Parliament that they want to regain control of our lawmaking, our democracy and on those who govern us. They want to elect those they can remove. Any candidate not fully committed to this will not receive my support.\nThe second question is whether the candidates will be more collegiate and listen to the views of real Backbenchers before they make big political decisions, including on matters that were not in our manifesto and also on what will be in our 2020 manifesto. We already have had attempts at railroading big political matters through without Backbench consultation such as an extension to Sunday Trading and also compulsory schools academisation. And when I talk about listening to Backbenchers, I do not just mean those from the “same old same old” backgrounds and professions, I am talking about those who have real world experience, who have stayed close to their roots and who have to fight for every single vote at General Elections in their constituencies. Those Backbenchers have, and maintain, a real authenticity and their views chime with many of those who voted Leave last week. It is time their voices are heard more, and given more responsibility in the Party many have fought for years in.\nThe third question to ask is whether they believe we need another General Election. Any candidate proposing such a move will not be receiving my support and I expect will not be receiving many other votes from marginal seat Backbenchers either. The General Election last year gave a clear mandate for a Conservative Government to maintain its path of economic growth, reducing Government debt and improving our public services. It also voted for a Conservative Government to deliver a European Referendum. Whoever the new Prime Minister is will not change that path or direction. The manifesto we were elected on remains the central pillar of Government policy, whoever the leader is.\nFinally, and some may say this is a parochial Parliament issue, but we need reform of the supposed Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA). No one can argue that there is not a need for independent oversight of Members of Parliament given the terrible expenses scandal of 2008/09 but the way that the current IPSA behaves needs reform. There will barely be a Backbencher (from any party) who is not unhappy with their offhand negative attitude, their belief that MP’s are an inconvenience and not experienced the hurdles they place in the way of MP’s which prevent them from being able to serve effectively. They have a core belief that all MP’s are millionaires and are only in it for themselves. Anyone wanting to know why many MP’s have not taken up all of the personal security options available should understand that to arrange for Lone Workers’ Devices means entering a world that even Franz Kafka would not dream of. Many of us have complained bitterly about their attitude and the need to reform their culture and attitude. This is an issue that must be tackled by any new Prime Minister on behalf of the whole House and the future of our democracy. Reform will help attract the best people to want to be a Member of Parliament.\nThese four questions are those that all Conservative Backbenchers should be asking those who seek our support to be the next Leader of our Conservative Party and Prime Minister of our Country. They are questions that need to be answered and any candidate will need to give those commitments if they want to make it through to the final round and go before the wider Conservative membership.",
  "https_www_karlmccartney_co_uk_/https_www_karlmccartney_co_uk_news_my-2016-reflections/content_9.html": "What a year in Westminster and in Lincoln.\nI have been involved in politics for over 30 years now and I have never seen such a momentous 12 months, let alone been involved in it.\nIf in January you would have told me we would have a new Prime Minister, Donald Trump as President-elect in the US and Jeremy Corbyn would be overwhelmingly re-elected Labour Leader, I would have shook my head in disbelief. It is different on Brexit of course - I always believed a resounding Leave vote would happen.\nWhat these events show is a general disenchantment with the direction of politics with a growing void between the public and the “Establishment” – government, big businesses, ‘experts’, media and trade unions (I still find it staggering that no one in the ‘labour’ movement has questioned the TUC specifically, who urged its members to vote Remain and were roundly ignored). I am confident that the new Prime Minister will bridge this gap over the coming years but it does show that politicians should never take the public for granted.\nOn Brexit, I always felt that if there was the opportunity for a Referendum, the British public would be brave enough to vote Leave, and so it proved. My key reflection is that the public are far wiser and more independent than the “Establishment” gives them credit for. You can only scare people into supporting your opinion, if you already have them on side. This is why Project Fear did not work because many of those (not all) did not have the credibility to frighten voters. Having Tony Blair and Lord Peter Mandelson promoting a Remain vote was a gift that kept on giving and I see that Labour’s Mayor of London has now appointed Lord Mandelson as a Brexit advisor…\nThe fact that the economy is still growing and unemployment is falling shows those who predicted economic meltdown did not have the good sense that the British public has.\nFrom a local perspective, Lincoln is now the jewel in the crown for the whole of the East Midlands, if not, the whole Country. Business is booming, tourism rising, universities thriving, unemployment falling and crime tumbling. We also have a fantastic civic community with charities and volunteers playing their full part in making Lincoln an exciting, vibrant and welcoming place. This is all before we recognise the fantastic heritage that we have with our magnificent Castle, Cathedral and Magna Carta.\nIt is worth reflecting that after years of constantly knocking on the right doors in Whitehall and raising my voice in Westminster, it does pay off in the end.\nThis year, we have seen the successful completion of the Lincoln East-West Road Link, a vital footbridge over the railway line in the City Centre and last month we had the re-confirmation of the full funding of the single carriageway Eastern Bypass - a project that will start in 2017. I was able to help the City and County Councils and others obtain the permission and funding they required to make all these projects happen. In the case of the Eastern Bypass I have always said a dual carriageway is the best, and needed, solution. It is a shame County Councillors in South Lincolnshire do not agree with me. These infrastructure projects, with many more to come, are vital to keeping our County and City moving and growing. Perseverance pays off.\nI am already excited about 2017 for both the Country and Lincoln. Next year, we will be taking the next vital steps in regaining control of our Country and the City will continue to bloom. I also hope that after what seems to have been a turbulent 2016, next year will be calmer…\nFinally, I would like to say thankyou to everyone who has played a part in Lincoln’s success story and also to those who have helped me play my part. A great City like this only succeeds with everyone working in partnership together. Thankyou.",
  "https_www_karlmccartney_co_uk_/https_www_karlmccartney_co_uk_news_vote-leave-brighter-better-britain/content_72.html": "Today is an historic day in the life of our Great Country.\nIt is the day when we all have a once in a lifetime opportunity to Vote to Leave the European Union. By doing so we will take back control of our Country’s future and make Britain a better and brighter Nation for current and future generations.\nFor those of you who have still not made up your minds on how to vote, I wholeheartedly believe there are five positive and good reasons to Vote Leave on Thursday which I would ask that you consider before deciding where to place your cross on the ballot paper.\n1. Better for our jobs and our businesses\nMore jobs will be created in our County and Country as we will cut the burden of endless Brussels’ bureaucracy on our businesses from the smallest to the largest. We will be able to trade more freely with the whole world as well as with our European neighbours just like we do now.\n2. Better for our public services and housing\nBritain will once again be able to address the unprecedented number of economic migrants coming into the County who are placing huge pressure on our schools, housing, welfare and health services. Every year our population grows by the size of Nottingham with over 250,000 people coming to Britain every year from the European Union alone. We can do nothing to reduce that figure.\nWe will also no longer have to send £350 million every week to the European Union which means we can decide what public services in the County we want to spend that money on.\n3. Better for our household and family budgets\nThe European Union forces us to charge VAT on everyday items like petrol and on family and household fuel bills. By Voting Leave we can set our own taxes again, meaning lower bills.\n4. Better for our security\nThe European Court of Justice can overrule our own laws on important matters like national security, border controls, and whether prisoners should get the vote. No wonder we have 4,600 European Union nationals in our prisons who each cost £36,000 per year to ‘look after’.\n5. Better for our democracy\nBy leaving the European Union, we will regain control of our laws, our democracy and on those who govern us. We will be a sovereign Country once again. Those who we elect we can remove, something that is impossible inside the undemocratic European Union. We have five European Union Presidents who impose rules and laws on us, can you name any of them?\nThe final question to ask yourself is to imagine the Referendum was the other way round: would you vote to join the European Union if we weren’t in it already?\nWhatever way you do vote, and, whatever the result, the fact that there has been such a lively and full debate in the City, County and Country, shows why it was so important that everyone had a say in the future of our great Nation. Long may it continue.\nI have seen enough European Union 'integration' over the last 40 years, and we are not voting for the status quo, and I do not want to see another 40 years of further integration, whether that be the Euro as our currency, an European Union Army or many more unelected Brussels bureaucrats, that is why I hope you will join me and Vote to Leave the European Union.",

It gives certainty to business, our European cousins and importantly, to every single person in our Country.\n“By also setting out clearly that we are leaving the European Union and the single market, and, having full control on immigration again, the world knows where we stand. The fact that so many Countries want to negotiate a free trade deal with us including key friends like the USA and key members of the Commonwealth, show that we will again be a global nation and not be held back by our membership of the European Union.\n“It is now time for those who want Brexit and our Country to fail, like the Labour Party, Liberal Democrats and the Scottish Nationalists, to realise they need to back the Prime Minister.

All sorts of reassurances were made by the then Highways England [now National Highways] about safety measures such as SVD.\nToday, after five years in which our warnings went unheeded, we are urging ministers to stop building smart motorways with immediate effect. A failed and dangerous experiment must come to an end now.\nLives cannot continue to be put at risk by this ill-conceived attempt to save money while expanding the capacity of our motorways.\nSmart motorways were introduced by the Labour government in 2006, with the first trial on the M42 around Birmingham.\nSince then, this type of traffic management — intended as a means of increasing motorway capacity when traffic is heavy — has become increasingly ‘popular’.\n‘Popular’, that is, only in the minds of the bean-counters in the civil service and the highly paid top brass at National Highways.\nThey have consistently given bad advice to successive government ministers of all parties and, as the committee concludes, failed to resolve safety concerns.\nGreen activists like smart motorways, too, because they never want to see any expansion of the road network under any circumstances — even if it would give them more places to glue themselves to.\nBut this scheme has always been viewed with high suspicion by most motorway users and motoring organisations.\nAnd rightly so. It defies common sense to take away the one lane — the hard shoulder — that has long been a (relatively) safe haven for those suffering breakdowns or accidents.\nIt is no wonder, as an RAC poll found recently, that six in ten motorists want the scheme scrapped. The chairman of the Police Federation, John Apter, has condemned it as ‘inherently dangerous’.\nAnd that is before we consider the fact that much of the technology is not 100 per cent operational, or even in working order, along much of the 360 miles of motorway (north and south bound) from which the hard shoulder has been removed so far.\nAs the Mail has reported, failures are numerous and persistent and I make no apology for repeating some of them here.\nThis newspaper found that one in ten cameras are not fully working — either broken, facing the wrong way or misted up.\nFlawed\nSoftware crashes in the six regional control rooms are frequent. One control room logged an average of nearly two CCTV and technical faults every day throughout 2020.\nSome of the hardware dates to 2004 — described by a staff member at National Highways as ‘a lot of faulty c***’.\nA frustrated camera operator told the Mail that his team had been unable to control signs and signals for several hours at a time.\nDrivers were told that lanes were open when they were closed, while speed limits signage could not be changed.\nOn one day, September 17 this year, the Mail discovered that almost half the cameras along one of the busiest sections of the M25 were out of action.\nEmails between senior managers acknowledged the existence of blindspots on this motorway, which sees perhaps the heaviest traffic in Britain.\nOn the same day, one in four cameras at junction 34 of the M1 near Sheffield were out of order or facing the wrong way — a particular concern, since this section of road is a notorious accident blackspot.\nA comment from a control operative overheard by the Mail’s reporter best sums it up.\nAfter an HGV struck a bridge on the M1, a lorry fire on the A14, and vital signals needed on smart motorway sections of the M25 and M4 were not operational, he joked: ‘We’ve got no signals, you’re all going to die… whichever god you believe in, start praying now.’ Black humour, one assumes, but not so very far from the truth.\nTwo weeks ago, whistleblowers at National Highways told the Mail that on one section of the M62, outside Manchester, two-thirds of the roadside message screens were out of action.\nIndeed, there are many members of National Highways staff who believe the organisation has been rolling out flawed technology and knowingly putting lives at risk.\nCertainly, the catalogue of system failures and glitches is horrendous and data about wider problems is often difficult to obtain.\nIn 2019, we were assured that all new smart motorways would have SVD technology fitted as standard, and existing stretches would be retrofitted. This has not happened.\nEarlier this year, amid plans to increase the total of ‘smart motorways’ to 500 miles, the same commitments were again made to the committee. Nothing has changed. This is unacceptable.\nCoffers\nSmart motorways are a failed policy and it is time to pull the plug. Drivers know that and now ministers should accept it, too.\nWe need to invest in expanding the motorway network so it can cope with increased traffic. And we have the money to do so.\nVehicle excise duty and fuel duty combined raised nearly £35 billion in 2019/20, of which only £11 billion was reinvested into our roads.\nGiven current petrol prices, the Treasury’s coffers are also brimful of money from drivers with all the extra VAT income.\nAnd I would go further: we need a full public inquiry to ensure those who brought in this lamentable policy are held to account for the failings — and the deaths — their decisions have caused.",
  "https_www_karlmccartney_co_uk_/https_www_karlmccartney_co_uk_news_brexit-select-committee-relentlessly-negative/content_95.html": "In response to the publication of the Committee on Exiting the European Union’s latest Report, Government's Negotiating Objectives: The White Paper, Karl McCartney JP MP, prominent Vote Leave campaigner and Conservative Member of the Committee, said: “I did not sign up to the Report, in its entirety, because its tone is relentlessly negative about the Government and is suggesting, erroneously, that our Conservative Government has not set out clearly what its intention and approach is to secure a successful Brexit.\n“Whilst the Committee, like all Select Committees, has a role in scrutinising and guiding the Government and perhaps suggesting policies to follow, it has to take into account the wider picture especially those issues outside our Government’s control. The latest Report does not sufficiently take into account the need for a co-operative attitude and a spirit of good neighbourliness from the European Commission, especially. This is not a one-way negotiation.\n\"It also does not take into account the needs of the 27 European Union Countries in ensuring Brexit works for them given the fact they need a free-trade deal with us as well and sell more to us than we sell to them. Nor will relying on World Trade Organisation rules be in the interests of the ‘27’ so the Committee should be clearer that this is the case rather than just placing all of the emphasis and pressure on our own Government.\n“The Report reads as if it expects the UK to be the only one that has to ‘give’ and our European neighbours to ‘take’. That is not a view that I, nor my sound minded colleagues, would be ‘bounced into’ - far from it in fact. Hence we made our disquiet and intentions clear in our private deliberations with the rest of the Select Committee and one would hope that the ‘Remain’ majority on the Committee will at last get over the result of June last year and start to take a more optimistic, positive and less gloomy view.\n“They perhaps need to take a more pragmatic view of reality, a bit like we did when confronted with their partisan report.\"\n- ENDS -\nFor further information, please contact Karl McCartney JP MP at [email protected] / 020 7219 7221.",

These could include human moderation, blocking content flagged by other users or sensitivity and warning screens.\nFirms will be made to show how they enforce their user age limits, to stop children from circumventing authentication methods, and they will have to publish details of when the regulator Ofcom has taken action against them.\nKarl said: “As increasing numbers of children across Lincoln use the internet, more needs to be done to make sure they are safe online.\n“That is why I welcome the Conservative Government’s improvements to the Online Safety Bill, making the internet safer for children while also protecting free speech – including by criminalising the encouragement of self-harm, requiring firms to show how they enforce user age limits, and prohibiting platforms from banning users where they do not breach their terms of service.\n“These important updates will make online content safer and hold social media giants to account, whilst ensuring that tech firms and future governments cannot censor legitimate views.”\nThe changes to the Online Safety Bill have been welcomed by the Children’s Commissioner For England, Dame Rachel de Souza; alongside charity Kick it Out, which opposes racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia in football; Mumsnet; the Jewish Community Safety Trust; and the Antisemitism Policy Trust.\nThe Conservative Government is boosting protections for women and girls online by requiring platforms to take proactive steps, including allowing users to manage who can interact with them or their content.\nNew duties on tech companies will strengthen the Bill’s protection of free speech by preventing social media giants from removing or restricting user content, or suspending or banning users, where their content does not breach either their terms of service or the law.\nDigital Secretary Michelle Donelan said: “Unregulated social media has damaged our children for too long and it must end.\n“I will bring a strengthened Online Safety Bill back to Parliament which will allow parents to see and act on the dangers sites pose to young people. It is also freed from any threat that tech firms or future governments could use the laws as a licence to censor legitimate views.\n“Young people will be safeguarded, criminality stamped out and adults given control over what they see and engage with online. We now have a binary choice: to get these measures into law and improve things or squabble in the status quo and leave more young lives at risk.”\n- ENDS -",

  "https_www_karlmccartney_co_uk_/https_www_karlmccartney_co_uk_news_importance-staying-true-what-you-believe/content_44.html": "Politics never sleeps.\nWe are only a few weeks into the New Year and we have already seen the soap opera surrounding the outgoing and incoming Presidents of the USA taking fresh twists and turns.\nThe Labour Leader, the Rt. Hon. Jeremy Corbyn PC MP, has proved himself again to be beyond satire as he seemingly changed his mind on EU immigration policy and salary caps within a matter of hours.\nWe have also seen our financial institutions and economists starting to (finally) admit their forecasts on Brexit were overblown as we see the economy grow apace meaning more jobs and wealth for our Country, though the important thing for me is to ensure everyone benefits.\nThere continues to be pressures on the NHS nationally and locally, and I would like to pay tribute and thank our local doctors, nurses and other health professionals for their sterling commitment and support over the Christmas and New Year period. We all should remember that they do the same important role every day of the year.\nIn terms of those pressures, the decision by the local Clinical Commissioning Group to close two surgeries in Lincoln, displacing 5,500 people, remains a real concern. A decision that risks increasing GP appointment waiting times across the City. Further pressures from any other closures in either the City or our County will only add further pressures to the service.\nThe pressures on our NHS also show why we need to urgently bring immigration down. Figures released just before Christmas showed 333,000 more people settled in this Country than left – the equivalent of having to accommodate the population of cities such as Nottingham or Leicester every single year. These immigration figures need to be addressed urgently. It is now the time to do, not just say.\nI was pleased to see that our Prime Minister, Rt. Hon. Theresa May MP, in her first major speech of the year set out a clear Conservative vision for the United Kingdom, a vision of a Shared Society is one I wholeheartedly agree with. Like her I want to ensure that everyone in our Country, County and City is able to share in the success of the Country and be able to make the very best of their lives, for themselves, their families and the community.\nThe key question as ever is to how to put this in practice. The support the Conservative Government has made in raising the national living wage, allowing people to earn more before they start paying tax and the recent announcement to tackle homelessness in our City are vital steps on this journey. I will be playing my part in this, especially in continuing to raise the profile of the need to tackle the underachievement of boys in the education system and the lack of male teachers in our schools.\nI commend the speech I made on this subject in September 2016 to everyone and it can be read and viewed here.\nI was struck on Thursday with the Thought for the Day from Canon Angela Tilby on BBC’s Radio 4. It is well worth a listen. She speaks very eloquently about the need for authenticity in politics and the pressures placed on politicians to not say what they really feel and believe in. This does not just apply to Members of Parliament, it is also applies to our City and County Councillors from all sides. There is always this constant pressure to conform.\nThis stems from collective decision making, the fact that political parties are “broad churches” so there will never always be agreement on all party policy and also pressure from Party Whips trying to bring everyone into line. For some, the far too many who only venture into politics for self-advancement, this is not an issue as they do not believe in anything, except of course, their own self-advancement.\nPlease rest assured there are a substantial number of my colleagues who like me are firmly staying true to what I believe remains key to what I do and say, both in Lincoln and in Westminster – something that will never change, no matter the “pressures” I come under to conform. It is what I believe the people of Lincoln want from their Member of Parliament. It is also what I believe the people across the Country partly showed in their actions and votes in last year's Referendum.",

All of these will support workers, families, pensioners and businesses right across Lincoln, Skellingthorpe, Bracebridge Heath and East Waddington. All have been greatly welcomed by Lincoln MP, Karl.\nThese measures include:\n- Better Childcare Support: Extending 30 hours of childcare a week to working parents of children aged 9 months to 4 years.\n- Supporting Energy Bills: Extending the Energy Price Guarantee at £2,500 for three months.\n- Freezing Petrol Duty Again: Fuel duty is frozen for a thirteenth year, saving the average driver around £200.\n- Protecting Lincoln Pensioners’ Incomes: Protecting the Triple Lock, providing certainty in retirement for all of Lincoln’s pensioners. This means that in April, the State Pension will increase in line with inflation, which is the biggest cash increase in the State Pension ever and will benefit all pensioners.\n- Raising Incomes for Lincoln’s Low Earners: Increasing the National Living Wage, providing a £1,600 annual pay increase for low-paid workers across Lincoln. From 1 April 2023, the National Living Wage will increase by 9.7 per cent to £10.42 an hour for workers aged 23 and over, delivering the largest-ever cash increase for the National Living Wage.\n- Better Journey for Lincoln’s Motorists: Investing £23 million to fix potholes across the East Midlands, funding enough to fix the equivalent of 460,000 potholes and improving journeys for motorists.\n- Better Support for Disabled People in Lincoln: Establishing a new Universal Support programme for disabled people and the long-term sick.\n- Supporting Lincoln’s Pubs: Delivering a Brexit Pub Guarantee so draught duty will always be less than duty in supermarkets.\n- Supporting Lincoln’s Businesses: Ensuring the UK still has lower corporation tax rates than the US, Germany, France, Italy, Japan and Canada alongside new tax credits for businesses to encourage greater investment.\n- Supporting our RAF: Investing an extra £5 billion in defence and national security over the next two years, improving our resilience and readiness of our defences - all of which will support RAF Waddington.\nIn response to the Budget, Lincoln MP, Karl, who always Puts Lincoln First, Karl McCartney, said: “Today's Budget once again has shown only the Conservatives are on the side of Lincoln’s workers, families, pensioners and businesses.\nIn this Budget, we are protecting pensioner incomes, helping families with childcare and energy costs, supporting motorists by freezing petrol tax and fixing potholes, as well as boosting the wages for those on low pay.\nWe are able to do this because we are successfully managing the economy through the current global cost of living crisis and because we believe in supporting the law-abiding majority.\nStarmer and his Lincoln Labour cheerleaders would wreck the economy and local jobs. They would put up taxes likely they always do, lose control of inflation that eats into everyone’s income and fails businesses, large and small. Like normal for Labour\".",
  "https_www_karlmccartney_co_uk_/https_www_karlmccartney_co_uk_news_speech-covid-19-vaccination-children/content_96.html": "It gives me deep and great pleasure to speak under your chairmanship, Dame Angela. I compliment my hon. Friend the Member for Penistone and Stocksbridge (Miriam Cates) on securing the debate.\nMany of us, when we come to put a speech together, think of different ways and processes to do it. Some use the rule of three, and I want to refer today to three words that I hope my hon. Friend the Minister and her colleagues in the Government take notice of: “Do no harm.”\nRegardless of the Chief Medical Officer’s overruling of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), I would say that when it comes to our nation’s children and young people, the people in these roles should remember that their actions should “do no harm”. Our colleagues in the Government —whether newly appointed or not—should also be mindful, in respect of the electorate’s children, that they should “do no harm”.\nThe new Minister will be aware of the strength of feeling displayed to her predecessor, my right hon. Friend the Member for Stratford-on-Avon (Nadhim Zahawi), and the Government in the recent urgent question on covid passports. It is, again, a fallacy that the direction that the Government wish to take will protect our children, especially as 50% to 70% of them are likely already to have contracted and survived Covid-19, according to the Office for National Statistics. Are we really showing that we are “doing no harm”?\nWe are told that any vaccination programme would not negate potential future school closures, so what is the point? Where is the political backbone? Is the Government’s plan that any future upsurge in age 12-to-15 cases could be ascribed to an Epsilon or a Zeta variant, or perhaps an Eta or a Theta variant? Will anyone give an Iota of credence to such an occurrence after what we have seen with hospital transference to care homes and the subsequent surge in cases in our older generation, and with the recent vaccinations and the delta variant that has emerged?\nWe should be mindful as politicians on both sides of the House, and I note at this point that there are not even three Opposition representatives on the other side of the Chamber, although I do see that the Opposition spokesman, the hon. Member for Leicester West (Liz Kendall), is in her place. We need to “do no harm” for myriad, if not a veritable plethora of, reasons.\nI turn now to the so-called Gillick principle. As no trials that have been made public are definitive, I fail to see how any child below 16 can be fully informed on the safety or otherwise of the vaccines? One would have to say that their teachers and head teachers cannot be fully informed either,\nThis is in particular in the light of the heart impacts on young males and the reported effects in more than 35,000 females of reproductive age reported in the UK national media this very last weekend. Can the chief medical officers and the JCVI, after their recent decision-making process, hold themselves to the maxim that they will “do no harm”?\nVaccine passports are not a first line of defence against a potential so-called winter wave of coronavirus, as Downing Street spokesmen are reported to have said. Our children of 12 to 15, like their older siblings and other under-25s who frequent nightclubs, bars and restaurants, are not to be used as a second line of defence either.\nI urge the Minister and her colleagues in the Government to remember to “do no harm”. There is no medium or long-term study data. I admire Chris Whitty and his colleagues for many things that they have done in the past 18 months. However, citing educational disruption, or the fear of more of it, as a justification for child vaccination against JCVI advice seems a little desperate, as far as I am concerned.\nWe were told that all those at risk needed to be vaccinated. They have been. Many others have caught and survived Covid-19. What real justification is there now to vaccinate those under 40 at all, some would ask?\nWe have had millions of various vaccinations. How many of those under 40 without any underlying health issues have died or been hospitalised purely because of Covid-19? So why are our children still taking tests after a whole summer of not doing so, as has been referred to? Is it perhaps because there are thousands, if not millions, of the tests sitting in warehouses? What sort of reason is that for imposing this sort of regime on them?\nAre we ensuring that we are “doing no harm”?\nAre the zealots in the civil service, the NHS and Government going to stigmatise and demonise any parent who expresses concern about the vaccination of our young children? This through fear and perhaps even lies, about taking a vaccine that has had no long-term testing and does not stop someone getting the virus or passing it on?\n“Do no harm” starts to have a very hollow ring.\nIf the Covid-19 risk for young people is much lower, while with vaccination there are heart risks for males—that is a real concern—and reproductive females are suffering side-effects, how does the Minister square that circle that we should “do no harm” to the young of the UK?\nThat next generation will be paying for this Government’s and the Minister’s decisions for many, many years and, I fear, perhaps in more ways than one.\n- Ends -",

With the big plans this year marking the Second Battle of Lincoln and the Charter of the Forest, our heritage and tourism sector continues to celebrate our past and expand 'our offer' for the future.\nIn addition, less than two weeks ago, as part of the Conservative Government’s Budget, more investment was announced to ensure our infrastructure keeps apace with the growing demands on the City. Again many of us, through the Greater Lincolnshire Local Economic Partnership (LEP) have worked away behind the scenes to ensure the success of the applications for our City and County.\nI joined LEP representatives including Cllr Colin Davie with Andrew Percy MP, the Parliamentary under Secretary of State at the Department for Communities and Local Government at the University of Lincoln as he announced £5 million for the development of a Greater Lincolnshire Centre for Health Science. He also announced £11.2 million for a Greater Lincolnshire Advanced Engineering, Research and Development Centre developed between Siemens and the University of Lincoln.\nOur two universities, our College, UTC and all our excellent schools add real depth to our City, which due to its size, means that students coming here from all four corners of the globe to learn and study will always take away good memories of our 'most loved' City. They will feel they have been a part of its fabric. I have always felt that going to university in one of our big cities is a whole different experience to studying in a smaller City like Lincoln. While you are there to learn and study at both, you may not feel the same sense of belonging to the community by studying in a large City rather than a smaller one.\nOne of my key political themes over the past and next year has been on boys’ education. It is why I was particularly pleased that the Chancellor announced extra investment into further and technical education which will benefit girls and boys alike – and of course those accessing courses at Lincoln College.\nI have felt for a long time that university is not for everyone and therefore the focus on A-Levels and degrees has been at the cost of perhaps a focus on, and an appreciation of, technical education and a non-academic education. In my mind, both are equally as valid, so, introducing T-Levels as the equivalent of A-Levels is indeed great news. The extra investment will also see a 50% increase in the number of hours students will be trained for and replace the maze of 13,000 qualifications with just 15. This is not just good news for students and business, it is good news for our Country and our County and nation's economy.\nWe are a long way down the international league when it comes to technical education – in fact we are placed 16th out of 20 developed economies. This has to change. By aiming to ensure our teenagers are \"work fit\" in a number of key industries, we will help bolster the City, County and Country’s young workforce and better take advantage of the opportunities that I firmly, positively and optimistically am sure Brexit will bring us.\nThe Government also announced an extra £2.5 million in road junction improvements on the A46 Lincoln Bypass, specifically the junctions with the A15 (to Scunthorpe), Nettleham (A46 to Market Rasen) and Wragby Road (A158 to Louth). This is on top of the extra Sunday trains between Lincoln and Nottingham announced by East Midlands trains and the start of the work to build the Eastern Bypass around the City, an issue I have relentlessly argued for at all levels of local and national government.\nEnsuring Lincoln is the jewel in the crown for the whole of the East Midlands, if not, the whole Country is my priority. We enjoy a real partnership between the public, private and charity sector across the whole of our City, and I will do my best to help ensure this continues. This is why the Government when looking to invest in key sectors, looks instantly to Lincoln as a real area of opportunity because of its buccaneering, partnership and positive outlook and willingness to do things differently and better. Lincoln is definitely now viewed as a place to be - and long may that continue.",

Our waters are a precious natural resource and they must be managed carefully. The future of the communities that earn their livelihoods from the sea and the biodiversity of the ocean depends on a balanced and considered approach to fisheries management.\nThe UK has 357 Marine Protected Areas covering a quarter of our Country’s waters, but the EU’s Common Fisheries Policy currently restricts our ability to impose more stringent protections on our own seas. After the end of the ‘transition period’, however, the UK will be able to introduce stronger measures so that we can manage our waters as we see fit.\nThe Fisheries Bill currently going through Parliament will help to protect our marine resources and develop plans to restore our fish stock back to more sustainable levels. This builds on a manifesto commitment which promised to introduce a legal commitment to fish sustainably as we become an independent coastal state once again.\nI understand that the access of super trawlers to UK waters is of significant concern to local fishing communities and to those working to protect our seas. That is why I am glad that the Fisheries Bill will provide the Government with powers to licence foreign vessels in UK waters. Foreign vessels will have no automatic right of access to our waters in the future. Any vessel granted access to our waters will also be required to abide by UK rules, including on sustainability, and I fully support this approach. We will once again be in control of how we protect our waters. I am confident that the Government is listening to concerns and taking action in the best interests of the UK. I will not be signing the campaign letter for this reason.",

  "https_www_karlmccartney_co_uk_/https_www_karlmccartney_co_uk_news_celebrating-our-great-past-looking-forward-future/content_22.html": "We in Lincoln are well aware of the pivotal role our beautiful Cathedral City has played in our nation’s history, heritage and democratic tradition. Indeed, when I was first elected in 2010, the City of Lincoln became the oldest constituency in continuous existence in the United Kingdom having been established in 1265.\nIn 2015 we celebrated the 800th Anniversary of the Magna Carta of which we have one of the four original copies here in our Castle - some say the best of the originals…\nAnd this year in Lincoln we can look forward to a year where we celebrate our great past by looking forward to the future.\nWe mark the 800th anniversary of two hugely significant and pivotal events in the history of our great City which have had a significant impact on the history and tradition of our Country.\nAs local historians know, on 20th May 1217, the Second Battle of Lincoln took place. This pitted the forces of France, who were occupying the City of Lincoln, against those forces of King Henry III under the command of William Marshall. Lincoln was one of the major cities in England and of utmost strategic importance. Despite the fall of the City late in the previous year, the Castle itself had been kept in the hands of the Crown by a formidable woman, Nicholaa de la Haye. Due to the bravery of de la Haye and Marshall, they rescued Lincoln by initially repelling and then ultimately defeating the invaders. Given that London at the time was effectively already in the hands of the French, if Lincoln Castle had fallen alongside the already occupied City, historians predict that we, as a Country, would have again been under foreign rule - something like 1066 all over again. The City was then looted by the victors (known as the Lincoln Fair) which is obviously something I do not want to see this, or any, year!\nFast forward a few months to 6th November 1217. In conjunction with the re-establishment of the Magna Carta, a 'companion' Charter was created entitled The Charter of the Forest - AKA 'The Charter of the Common Man'. Whilst the former was based on protecting the rights of the Barons and the aristocracy, the latter was based on re-establishing the rights of free-men.\nThis Charter was needed because the two previous Kings (Richard and John) had been guilty of land grabbing by placing restrictions on the usage of Royal Forest Land (forest in those days also included heathland, moors and fields) by common men thus making life harder for those who needed the land to survive and thrive.\nThe Charter of the Forest prevented the monarchy from taking land without a form of due process and re-established land boundaries from the time before the two Kings had taken the throne. It also started the process of limiting unaccountable sovereign power and provided real rights to all. By happy (or planned…) coincidence, today, the only place in the world where you can see original copies of the Magna Carta and the Charter of the Forest alongside each other is actually in our Lincoln Castle.\nStanding shoulder to shoulder with our Castle is our historic Cathedral which working with others over recent months I was proud to assist and help secure £11.4 million of lottery funding to convert the existing Deanery into a Visitors’ Centre, café and shop. As part of the Lincoln Cathedral Connected project, the Dean’s Garden will also be opened up to the public for the first time. It will create a number of new jobs and volunteering opportunities, and provide training for Cathedral staff and volunteers. It will also secure the future of our internationally renowned and historic Cathedral as it approaches its 1000th year.\nOur Cathedral and Castle, which has also received much welcome investment recently, are two of our nation’s greatest treasures and are pivotal to Lincoln’s aim to become a top tourist destination in both the County, Country and the World. They play an essential and central role in our City’s history and also play the same role in our City’s future. We should celebrate and cherish both in equal measure at every available opportunity.",

He was also influenced by his wider family including both sets of Grandparents, especially his maternal Grandfather who was a plasterer. Karl was educated at local schools: Woodfall Lane, Birkenhead School for Boys, Neston High School and then later at Willink School in Berkshire. He read geography at St David’s University College in Lampeter, where he was the Student Union President and captained the Welsh Universities’ Football Team.\nKarl worked as an election agent and researcher at Conservative Party Central Office in the early 1990s, he also worked with various Lord Mayors of London in the City in the late 1990s. He later took an MBA at Kingston University Business School and then worked as a Management Consultant for a number of clients and agencies including Westminster City Council, Transport for London and the Strategic Rail Authority before working directly for Terry Smith at Collins Stewart and Tullett Prebon, and was the successful Campaign Director of the ‘Sir Keith Park Memorial Campaign’. In 1999 he received the Freedom of the City of London. He has also been a Parish Councillor and school governor and since 1999, a Magistrate.\nHe moved to Lincolnshire after being selected to fight the Parliamentary constituency of Lincoln and reduced the Labour majority in the 2005 General Election. Five years later a further vote swing of nearly 6 per cent saw him elected as Lincoln’s Conservative Member of Parliament, which is now the oldest constituency in existence since the 13th Century.\nBy “Putting Lincoln First”, he has always been a strong advocate for the City and notable successes have been secured in seeking resolutions to the City’s many transport issues. Since 2010, he has been able to secure funding for the East-West Link Road in the centre of Lincoln, the vital Eastern Bypass (opened in Christmas 2020), dualling sections of the Western Bypass and a wide range of bottleneck and pinch-point improvements. Karl has also helped secure initial weekday direct services to London and then six daily Direct Trains to and from London, improved cross-country train services and Level Crossing Footbridges in the City Centre. He also secured £11 million in funding from DfT for Lincoln’s Transport Hub.\nThe Cathedral City of Lincoln is situated in one of the largest Counties in the United Kingdom and Karl has been a vocal supporter of traditional Conservative values in the House of Commons. In 2012 he was elected by his Conservative Backbench colleagues to the Executive of the influential 1922 Committee and throughout his time as a Member of Parliament, he has continuously been re-elected to the same position.\nIn 2012, Karl was also elected onto the Transport Select Committee, which is charged by the House of Commons to examine and scrutinise the expenditure, administration and policy of the Department for Transport and its associated public bodies. Throughout his in Parliament, he has continuously been re-elected to this Committee.\nKarl was a prominent Leave Campaigner in the EU Referendum of 2016, subsequently being elected by his colleagues to be a Member of the Exiting the European Select Committee (known colloquially as the ‘Brexit Committee’) in 2016, and he led the successful political campaign across Greater Lincolnshire during the EU Referendum. Also, during the 2015 - May 2017 Parliament Karl was a leading advocate in the House of Commons in tackling the educational underperformance of boys and the gender education gap, and also for ensuring there are curbs on false whiplash car injury insurance claims.\nIn 2019, Karl was successfully elected again to be Lincoln’s Member of Parliament, with a majority of 3,514. This majority was nearly 2,500 votes higher than when he was first elected to represent the Parliamentary constituency in 2010. He continues to support transport investment in and around the Constituency, champions local business and is a huge supporter of the wonderful heritage that forms the beating heart of the City.\nKarl acted as Parliamentary Under Secretary of State in the Department of Transport from 8 July 2022 through to 8th September 2022.\nAs well as supporting his family including his two sons, his interests outside of politics include most sports, and particularly football, rugby, cricket, snowboarding and motorsports. He is also a mini-rugby coach on Sunday mornings at Lincoln Rugby Club and has been for eight years.",

I have recently been informed I have passed the first stages of the CCHQ selection and am now one of six Members of our Party on the short list from which the Conservative Party Candidate for this new and important public office will be chosen on the 7th December. I look forward to these next steps.\nI pledge to serve the people, businesses and Conservative Party across our wonderful County using my experience, dedication and tenacity, as I have done in my previous role as a Member of Parliament for Lincoln. I will always ‘Put Greater Lincolnshire First.\nAs the MP for Lincoln for over 12 years, my proven track record of successfully delivering for Lincoln and Lincolnshire speaks for itself. I believe this positions me well to be a strong candidate both amongst my peers and on the hustings amongst our electorate whose support we must ultimately win in May next year.\nAs well as my career in Parliament, which means I understand well how the machinery of Government operates, I also have deep experience of local government having been a local government officer for over five years and a Councillor for five years, standing in various elections in different areas. I believe knowing how both tiers of Government work (national and local) will be essential for the new Mayor. I have also served at various levels in our Party as a volunteer, as a Branch Chairman, Association Officer roles and as a qualified Agent in the early 1990s, and in 2007 I was the Area Chairman of Lincolnshire.\nI also have business experience having operated in various roles in the City of London, working with the Lord Mayor of the City, and in roles such as a Logistics Analyst and as a management consultant in the private sector with Initiate and directly for both the Country Land and Business Association and other organisations such as the Strategic Rail Authority and TfL. I worked across London and the South East, and the Midlands, as well as nationally and internationally and that professional and business acumen is the third leg of the stool of experience that I believe the new Mayor of Greater Lincolnshire needs to have.\nMy plans for future prosperity for our County focus on economic growth, improved transport infrastructure, and housing, which are vital for Greater Lincolnshire's success.\nAs Mayor, I would work closely with local councils, businesses, and community organisations to deliver on these themes. I would collaborate with the Police and Crime Commissioner to improve policing and reduce crime across Lincolnshire; despite all the good work, Lincolnshire Police are still underfunded.\nThis role requires an outward-facing advocate for Lincolnshire - someone who can focus on securing investment and attention from Westminster without interfering with how our Councils are run. As Mayor, I would be the focal point for making the case for our historic County, highlighting its importance not just in food and agriculture but also in emerging industries like defence and energy.\nSuccessful Mayors, such as Andy Street and Lord (Ben) Houchen, have shown the value of partnering with all levels of Government to speak with one voice on critical issues like transport and housing. That is the approach I would take for Greater Lincolnshire. It should not be for any Mayor to start dictating to local Councillors where they should and should not be building houses.\nNext May will be politically challenging, and conversations I am already having indicateThe Reform Party poses a real threat. My deep experience in Lincolnshire politics, and fundraising, would help drive a campaign between now and next May to ensure we do not see a repeat of past losses. My extensive network of contacts across the County and Country, both within and outside of our Party, will enable me to raise a significant Fighting Fund that, together with County Councillors and Candidates, we can use to ensure Lincolnshire stays blue.\nI am the right candidate to represent the Conservative Party and win this Greater Lincolnshire Mayor election. I will campaign across the County alongside Conservative Candidates to ensure our shared success in May 2025.\nI would welcome your support and would be grateful for your endorsement and any advocacy you might be minded to undertake. If you would like to discuss any ideas or priorities, please do not hesitate to contact me in the most convenient way for you. Thankyou for your time and consideration.",

The five promises are: • Halve inflation this year, to ease the cost of living and give people financial security • Grow the economy, creating better-paid jobs and opportunity across the country • Getting our national debt down, so that we can secure the future of public services • Cutting NHS waiting lists, so people can get the care they need more quickly • Legislating to stop the boats, making sure if you come here illegally, you are detained and swiftly removed Those five promises are not the limit of the Conservative Government’s ambitions.

This week’s tragic deaths in the Channel show the urgency to deal with this problem.\nLincoln’s Conservative MP, Karl, fully endorses this plan in dealing with the unacceptably large number of migrants coming to the UK illegally, which includes over 40,000 from across the Channel. He also strongly condemns the socialist Labour Party for opposing any plans to deal with this problem, which is no surprise, given how weak they have always been on illegal immigration, in the past as much as now.\nOver 40,000 people have illegally crossed the Channel in small boats this year, putting pressure on public services. Many originate from safe countries and travel through safe countries, which is why the Prime Minister has prioritised this issue since he took office. So far, he has delivered the largest ever small boats deal with France which increases UK-funded patrols by 40%, re-established the Calais Group of Northern European nations to disrupt traffickers, and set a long-term ambition for a UK-EU wide agreement on migration.\nHowever, the measures announced this week go even further and include:\n- A new agreement with Albania so that the vast majority of Albanian claimants can be removed, with weekly flights\n- A new, permanent, unified Small Boats Operational Command in the channel with 700 new staff\n- Tougher immigration enforcement with 200 new staff and better data sharing with banks\n- Cheaper accommodation sites so we can move migrants out of expensive hotels\n- Clear the initial asylum backlog by 2023 by doubling the number of caseworkers and radically streamlining the process\nLabour is very weak on illegal immigration. Throughout his career, Keir Starmer has blocked steps to strengthen our immigration system. On 36 occasions he has failed to vote for strengthening asylum rules. Instead, he’s spoken in favour of weakening our asylum rules and has stood against illegal migrants being arrested for illegally working here.\nKarl, who always Puts Lincolns First!, said: “As a country, we need to get a grip on illegal immigration and I am confident this new five-point plan will do just that. It has my full support. The numbers coming into this country through illegal means have to stop. It is putting pressure on public services as well as causing serious concern amongst the majority of people across Lincoln, Skellingthorpe, Bracebridge Heath and Waddington East. It is unfair to those who come here legally, unfair to those who have a genuine asylum claim – and unfair to the British people who play by the rules. This week’s tragic deaths in the Channel show the urgency to deal with this problem.”\n“Only the Conservative Government is taking this issue seriously. Labour’s Leader has continuously voted against attempts to strengthen the rules. The whole Labour Party has always been weak on illegal immigration and it is no different now. It is no surprise of course, given Labour does not care about issues that concern normal people as their sole focus is on policies which are popular in Islington and Hampstead, not what people in places like Lincoln want.”",

The City of Lincoln was certainly at the top of the list and in fact, in the year I was elected (2010), Lincoln became the oldest constituency in continuous existence in the United Kingdom having been established in 1265.\nIn 2015 we celebrated the 800th Anniversary of the Magna Carta - and we have one of the four original copies here in our Castle - some say the best of the originals… This year in Lincoln we now mark the 800th anniversary of two hugely significant and pivotal events in the history of the United Kingdom – where we took back control of both our liberty and our nation. The events and characters in 1217 bear more than a striking resemblance to the same events facing our great Country in 2017 – and despite the best efforts of the Labour Party, Scottish Nationalists, Liberal Democrats and some on my own side of the House, I am confident that the same result will be achieved again (without the bloodshed and the sacking of our beautiful City though!).\nOn 20th May 1217, the Second Battle of Lincoln took place. This pitted the forces of France, who were occupying the City of Lincoln, against those forces of King Henry III under the command of William Marshall. The City was one of the major cities in the whole of England and of utmost strategic importance. Despite the fall of the City late in the previous year, the Castle itself, had been kept in the hands of the Crown by a formidable woman, Nicholaa de la Haye. Due to the bravery of de la Haye and Marshall, and their soldiers, they defeated the invaders and Lincoln was eventually rescued. Given that London at the time was effectively already in the hands of the French, if Lincoln Castle had fallen alongside the already occupied City, historians predict that we, as a Country, would have again been under foreign rule - 1066 all over again.\nFast forward a few months to 6th November 1217. In conjunction with the re-establishment of the Magna Carta, a companion Charter was created entitled The Charter of the Forest - AKA 'The Charter of the Common Man'. Whilst the former was based on protecting the rights of the Barons and the aristocracy, the latter was based on re-establishing the rights of free men.\nThis Charter was needed because the practices of the two previous Kings (Richard and John) had not only increasingly placed restrictions on the usage of Royal Forest Land (forest in those days also included heathland, moors and fields) by common men, they were also declaring more and more land to be defined as Royal Forest. This greatly affected those who used the land to live: for industry, cultivation, housing and grazing. In effect, the Kings had not only been guilty of land grabbing, they were making life harder for those who needed that land to survive and thrive.\nThe Charter prevented the monarchy from taking land without a form of due process and re-established land boundaries from the time before the two Kings had taken the throne. It also started the process of limiting unaccountable sovereign power and providing real rights to all. By happy (or planned…) coincidence, today, the only place in the world where you can see original copies of the Magna Carta and the Charter of the Forest alongside each other is actually in our Lincoln Castle.\nWhilst there are clear parallels with today, and the displayed need and action by the people of our Country to wish to return our Sovereignty to our shores, certainly perhaps one can suggest that our Prime Minister is more than a worthy successor to de la Haye in defending our nation. Further, the very British principles behind the events 800 years ago are the same now as they were then; sticking to key principles, delivering the will of the people and not giving in when events are making life tough. As can be seen by the joy that some of my fellow Parliamentarians have met the last few week's events with, many do not share or understand these principles. What of course is so disturbing is that they boldly state they do, when we all know their game. They clearly want to thwart or overturn the Referendum result and to not only delay it, but to damage it and damage our Country’s good name and standing in the world – all for their own ends. My sound colleagues and I on the Brexit Select Committee see examples of this self-interest and self-absorption every week from some Members. It is becoming a bore, but is necessary to continually remind them to respect the Referendum result.\nCome what may though, this year, in the shape of the forthcoming Great Repeal Act, we will see a new version of that original Charter of the Forest. We took back control in 1217, I am proud to say that we will do so in 2017.",
  "https_www_karlmccartney_co_uk_/https_www_karlmccartney_co_uk_news_launch-active-lincolnshire/content_56.html": "Thankyou Janet for inviting me to such an important event, and through you I would like to thank your Board and your team for all of your work in creating this new strategy and the important change in your name and the work that you all do and of course I wish you well in the future too.\nBeing from a public relations background, I fully understand and appreciate the need to ensure that the name of the organisation reflects both its values and also what it does, which is why this change will further build on the success of Lincolnshire Sport.\nIt will have a broader appeal to those who are perhaps put off by the word sport, (those of you who know me will appreciate that I do not suffer from such an apprehension – I’m willing to give most activities a go – although bungee jumping holds no attraction whatsoever…) but those put off potentially by the word sport, should be reassured as they can now feel that there is something they can do that does not need them to join, take part and enter competitions – as being active – going for a walk, gardening or cutting the grass, is something you can do on your own, in your time and at your own pace.\nOur County of Lincolnshire has so much going for it, a rich history, successful businesses, a great rural economy, a lovely County City – the most loved City in the East Midlands certainly, and a strong civic culture in its towns and villages and Countryside that is the envy of many areas elsewhere.\nOn top of all of that we have great people living and working here and also great organisations such as those of you in the room, all working together to provide the best support possible to everyone in our County. This creates a real sense of belonging so people are proud to be a Yellowbelly, or feel as I and some of my family do, that they are part or honorary yellowbellies as they make our County their adopted home.\nThis is why being active is so important because it binds people together. There are of course the health benefits, the economic benefits and the mental benefits, which are clearly articulated in the strategy and the vision. And I hope that we can make sure more than 20,000 people who are currently inactive across the County lead a more active life by 2021.\nBut on top of all of this, there are the social benefits.\nI and my wife Cordelia both coach and referee my youngest son’s rugby teams every Sunday and are also involved in other sports with them such as football, tennis, cricket and rowing. I myself in my time was a mean/keen footballer, an agricultural cricketer and I am now one of our country’s largest and slowest rugby union fly-halfs…allegedly. I still don the boots of my youth from time to time …if truth be told when any opportunity arises.\nWhat makes this all fun is not just seeing my sons play, it is the camaraderie with the other parents and teams – the common purpose and experiences you share, the spirit of being with people from all walks of life and of course the gossip. And never forget complaining about the referee… except when I am the man in the middle of course.\nWe can also see this in how the whole City and County came together behind the exploits of Lincoln City FC in the FA Cup and it would be really be interesting if we can find out how this has had an effect on young men and women wanting to start playing football in Lincolnshire, and being more active.\nThis camaraderie we can see not just in sport in its purest sense but in fitness activities in gyms, walking clubs, jogging clubs, slimming clubs, walking football games, bowls and or just those who want to walk home from work rather than getting in their cars.\nWith such a rural landscape where there are plenty of activities, it can seem strange at face value that we need an Active Lincolnshire at all, but often it is human nature not to appreciate what is on your doorstep. This is why this organisation is needed more so than ever and why I really welcome this new strategy and the new name. I would also like to mark my thanks to Active Lincolnshire and to thank everyone from Sport England, our local authorities, schools, sports clubs and individuals who all play a role in keeping Lincolnshire Active.\nLastly, and I know there will be many official thanks before she leaves, but I would like to start the ball rolling by saying that it has been a great pleasure working with Janet since I was first elected and we both wish you the very best for the future. I know over the 17 years at Lincolnshire Sport, including the last seven as Chief Executive that Janet has made a real difference to the lives of people in the City and Constituency I represent, and across the County. This new strategy and name are a fitting legacy.",
  "https_www_karlmccartney_co_uk_/https_www_karlmccartney_co_uk_news_educational-performance-boys-and-gender-education-gap/content_79.html": "It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship this afternoon, Mr. Walker, and I am pleased to see so many Members from all sides of the House here and I do hope everyone will have an opportunity to take part, should they so wish.\nI am delighted to lead this debate, because the educational underachievement of boys is a One Nation issue, it is an equality and fairness issue and an issue that should be front and centre of this Country’s conversation on education and social mobility.\nThe issue of our gender education gap and its impact is one that I feel has not been adequately addressed by this House, by successive Governments of all colours and one that the education sector itself seems reluctant to take action on. And that is a shame.\nThis is not an issue just about working class boys or no income families, albeit this is a group, of course, that does need attention, it is an issue that affects boys across the board including a group that is so often missed out, those boys from the low to low middle income households.\nAs Members of this House, we all hold dear the desire to ensure every young person in our great Country has the opportunity to make the make the most of their life and their skills. We also all want a cohesive society, the opportunity for social mobility for all and a successful economy, even more so in a positive post-Brexit economy. We all may have different ideas on how we achieve this but our aims are surely all the same.\nSo the reason for this debate is to set out what the gaps are, its impact to date, the reasons and what action I believe needs to be taken. For it is this positive action to tackle this inequality, that has been lacking and which needs to be quickly addressed. We cannot afford to keep letting more generations of our boys down by not addressing this glaring gender education gap – talk, or more talk, and no action will no longer pass muster.\nIt is also important to set out the framework of the debate in that this is about closing the gap between the education performance of boys and girls but not at the cost of reducing girls’ performance - that is a Socialist creed that I will not countenance. I want levels of attainment for all to be comparable and raised, not lowered. We need the performance of both to keep on improving but for the gap between both to close.\nThe statistical background\nIt has to be recognised that the performance of boys has continued to improve over time. The number of boys going to university each year is 46,000 higher than a decade ago and there has been a steady improvement in GCSE and A-Level results.\nWhat has stayed the same though is that there is a clear gap between boys and girls and in some areas such as higher education, this gap is increasing.\nAt Key Stage 2 level, (in old money, 11 year olds) the pass rate gap is six percentage points and often when boys are entering primary school they are already behind.\nFor 5 GCSEs including English and Maths in England, the gap is now 9 percentage points. In my County of Lincolnshire the gap is 10 percentage points. The gap at 16 years of age in Wales is 7.5%, Scotland 7% and Northern Ireland is 7.3%. For EBaccalaureates the gap is just under 10%.\nAs we move further through the education system, at A-Level, the average grade for a boy is C and for a girl it is C+ albeit a higher percentage of boys achieve 3 A or A* stars than girls.\nIn terms of higher education, fewer boys go to university due to lower attainment in earlier school or college years. 60,000 less in 2015 and a gap of 460,000 over the last ten years. Results at university also show that boys will also achieve lower grades and are more likely to drop out as well. Two thirds of all courses now have more women than men on them.\nThe impact of underperformance\nAs we all know and see every day in our Constituencies, while facts are one thing, it is the actual impact on the lives of individuals and their families that matter. This gap also affects our community, our businesses and our ability to compete as a Nation. I see its impact when driving around certain areas in the daytime and see young men hanging around when they should be in work, on an Apprenticeship or at university or college.\nMost male NEETs are unemployed. For these men with no, or low, skill levels, this has an impact on their mental health, employment and predilection to commit crime. These men constitute the largest group within our criminal justice system.\nWhen it comes to Apprenticeships, there are now 30,000 more female apprentices, a trend and gap that has been in place for at least the past five years.\nAfter university, a lower percentage of male graduates will be in full time work when they leave, a higher percentage will be unemployed and also far fewer enter the professions. Nowadays there are more women becoming doctors, vets, dentists, solicitors and teachers than men every year – a reflection in the numbers taking related degrees. Twice as many women are now training to be a GP than men.\nLastly, we can see this all played out when it comes to wages, because according to the Office for National Statistics on average men in full time or part time work under 29 years of age are paid less per hour on average than similarly aged women. This remarkable transition flies in the face of the shrill equal-pay brigade who whilst proclaiming the need for equality, seem to quietly gloss over this fact when shouting from the roof tops with regard to equal pay. I want equal pay for those with equivalent experience and qualifications and skill levels regardless of their gender, and their age.\nThe causes of the gender education gap\nBut what is causing this gap, a gap that broadly was not there before the 1980s and one that has been increasing since then?\nThis has been an area of some contention which may partly explain why so little investigation has so far taken place, because it is difficult to agree or find solutions if there is no agreement of what is causing the problem.\nIn essence there are a number of themes:\nThe first theme is that boys develop more slowly in their teen years than girls so boys and girls are not at the same natural development level, even when they are the same age. Many of us long ago accepted that boys and girls are different.\nThe second is around social attitudes and background.\nThere is some evidence that boys’ attitudes towards education is lower than girls and they receive less support at home.\nThe role of fathers, and role models, is seen as vital to instilling into their sons the importance of education - perhaps longer working hours and one parent families where the father is not the primary carer are an issue.\nThe economy has changed so the value and job opportunities in masculine type work such as in heavy industry has changed or are not available as much as they once were.\nAnother theme is whether the education system is ‘boy-friendly’?\nI believe the education system, schools and the sector as a whole is not focussed enough on supporting boys. This could be because schools lack understanding about boys and what makes them tick. The need for practical education, a level of freedom to think and act for themselves, clear goal setting, career and subject choice support - all within a clear disciplinary framework. And, an environment that nurtures and celebrates, not denigrates masculinity.\nThis is exacerbated by the lack of male teachers and role models in schools and if boys only see women in schools, in whatever roles, this reinforces their view that education is just for girls.\nI, and others have noticed that the majority of pictures in the national papers recently, and each year it seems, were just of girls celebrating their exam success, not boys and girls – sending a subliminal message to boys that education and success is a girl issue – and not for them.\nPerhaps the education sector shies away from any focus on boys because it is not pc - politically correct. Certainly there is deafening silence from the education trade unions and others. There would be no silence if the genders were reversed, of that I am sure.\nAlso the move from all or nothing exams to continual assessment at GCSEs has been seen as favouring a female way of learning, albeit with the recent changes swinging the pendulum slightly back towards a level playing field, it will be interesting to see whether this makes any difference to the gender education gap over the next few years.\nLastly, is there something else at play around the 16-18 age range regarding the welfare system especially for low or no income families, particularly the effect on young men who may be reluctant to take up an Apprenticeship because their families lose child benefit and it affects their working families tax credit. Some families do not want their sons and daughters to take up Apprenticeships.\nThis is an issue a well-respected and successful training provider in Lincolnshire called Lagat has found and they have made me aware of various examples of opportunities being denied young people, of both genders, because their families do not wish to be disadvantaged financially. My colleagues in Government need to take heed and act positively to ensure this penalisation is removed quickly!\nWhat strikes me most out of everything to do with this issue are two things.\nFirstly, there is not a wholesale body of research, nor agreement on the causes, and the education sector is not focussed on this issue at all it seems. This is despite the valuable work by pressure groups, charities and think tanks from organisations such as the Higher Education Policy Institute and particularly the HEPI Report 84 authored by Nick Hillman and Nicholas Robinson with a foreword by Mary Curnock Cook, which I recommend to anyone who is interested in this issue. Other organisations with good research on this matter also include Save the Children, the National Literacy Commission, the Sutton Trust and the Social Mobility Commission and many others.\nThe second issue is that there does not seem to be agreement on what causes the gender education gap and of course this then makes it far harder to decide on what to do to positively address the problem.\nThe solutions\nSo I have set out so far, the statistics, the impacts and the broad debate on the causes but what are the solutions?\nWhat we do know is that the limited amount, if any, of the solutions that have been implemented, are not working because the gap is not closing.\nThe first theme is to encourage and instil in the minds of parents and their sons that a good education is to their benefit and to re-instil a sense of aspiration, pride and understanding.\nAs Steve Biddulph’s books on parenting show, parents need to step up to the plate too in ensuring that boys are inspired and given opportunities to excel and aspire to do as well as their fellow female pupils at all ages.\nBy using practical examples, case studies, mentors perhaps, destination data, inspirational people from the local community, the National Citizen’s Service and other methods like this will surely have a positive effect as quickly as possible.\nWe have to provide clear reasons for boys to go to school and college and to concentrate and work hard whilst they are there. We need to communicate to parents and ensure they and the interaction they receive supports them every step of the way. The fact that no, or low, income girls still do better in educational attainment means that parental attitudes is not the only issue at play in this arena.\nThe education sector at a national and local level has to and can do more. Certainly we know there are schemes that form part of University Access Agreements to persuade more boys to go to university, but it is no criticism of the universities as they need more boys to achieve the grades to be able to go – and stay and not drop-out.\nI believe, and I know many others such as Mary Curnock Cook, the Chief Executive of UCAS feels similarly, that we need more male teachers in schools at every level. Less than one in six primary school teachers are male and less than two in five at secondary level and this ratio is not improving on an equality level. This cannot go on and I am confident it is one of the main causes of boys being behind their female classmates.\nWe also need schools to rethink everything they do to ensure that everything they do is boy-friendly, not just girl-friendly.\nThe third theme is to be positive about masculinity in schools.\nBoys need outlets for their creativity, energy and natural instincts. They need to know it is OK to be masculine and that masculinity is the equal to femininity.\nIt is a positive thing to like cars, engines, building sites, getting your hands dirty and playing sport. It is also a positive thing to like dancing, painting, sculpture, acting and writing plays – but we must not shy away at any level from celebrating what are traditional male or masculine roles – it is what we as males were born to do.\nIt may also surprise some ladies that some males can multi-task, some of us can cook and wash and sew and manipulate a Dyson without instruction and make a damn good job of it, but we also like to compete at scrabble, cards, jenga, football, rugby, cricket, hockey and whatever else we have the opportunity to engage in. And there is nothing wrong with that.\nI fear the over feminisation of our education system has, and is, turning boys off of education – we need to nurture men and play to their strengths. Boys want to be young men, and young men want to be grown men – this is something that should be seen as a positive.\nSome say grammar schools could be the answer and they may be for some, but we need all schools to be successful.\nBringing back secondary moderns for those who do not go to grammar schools and to ensure they attain the same results would cost a fortune and may not be in the short or long run attainable, so any moves on this policy need to be well thought out – no one, whatever their gender or background deserves to be left behind.\nIf I am anything it is someone who believes in striving for a utopian completely level playing field in life’s chances, but I am a realist and I know that such a dream can never be, but I will do my best to ensure that our young people realise that, as my Maternal Grandma said to me and my younger brothers on more than one occasion – “no-one can ever take your education away from you.”\nShe wanted us to work hard at school and go on to college or university, and it only through the second and perhaps third chances I have been granted – mainly through her and my grandfather’s and parent’s sacrifices that I was able to achieve what I have achieved. It is why I am honoured and privileged to stand here, in this place, in front of you all today as one of the 650 Members of Parliament who have been elected to represent their fellow countrywomen and men – of all ages and educational attainment.\nLong Term Apprentices have a role.\nAdditionally, I believe we also should be having three, five or seven year Apprenticeships that are equivalent to degrees but which are vocational for those who are non-academically minded. These of course should be available to girls as well as boys. We need to think differently. It works in countries like Germany, so why not here?\nUniversity is not for everyone and certainly with an increase in participation rates from circa 5% in the early 80’s to 30% in the early 90’s to 47% now, it should not mean it is automatically the primary option for young people. The Labour con of the late 1990s’ to keep youth unemployment figures low is not a good reason to increase University attendance and participation, whilst, I believe, wanting to win in a global economic race with a well-experienced and well-educated and motivated workforce across the myriad of economic sectors is.\nAnd I find it odd that while we are all promoting more women to be engineers and scientists, there is no such reciprocal schemes for boys. Given the lack of young men now entering the professions, where are the schemes for young men enticing them to apply themselves and to enter such professions where they are now underrepresented; such as teaching, medicine, law, psychology and a whole raft of other subjects and specialisms?\nWe need focus and leadership\nMy final theme is about focus and political leadership.\nThere has been precious little attention and focus from the Department for Education, or anyone else for that matter in Government and Whitehall, in terms of recognition, policy and action on this issue.\nGiven this pattern has emerged and then become embedded for three decades, it is an issue for Governments of all shades including the last Labour Government to hold their heads in shame and their hands up in acknowledgement that they missed a trick and seek redemption.\nIn my view I am almost certain that if the genders were reversed this current situation would not be the case. Indeed for over 20 years there have been copious amounts of taxpayers’ money successfully spent on encouraging female applications for STEM subjects and a plethora of degree subjects, college courses and in more recent years, Apprenticeships. This is all to be welcomed but where has the focus and investment been for boys?\nI also looked at what focus there was from the Government Equalities Department, the Equalities and Human Rights Commission and the educational trade unions. Little if anything was the result of such fruitless searches.\nThis subject is not going to go away. We cannot wait any longer for more generations of boys to fall behind girls educationally. This is why I believe the Government needs to set up an Implementation Taskforce as it has done on so many other important policy areas. This is exactly such a policy area.\nThe Government has rightly given much focus, policy and leadership on matters such as the lack of women on Boards and the gender pay gap. There is an un-arguable case that the Government should give the same level of focus, policy and leadership on the gender education gap as it has on those worthy issues that have received much media and BBC coverage in recent politically correct years.\nThe Department for Education and Ofsted need to step up to the plate and ensure schools, whether run through LEAs, or as academies and free schools, are boy-friendly.\nThe gender education gap is a very serious matter affecting boys, their families, communities, businesses and our Country as a whole. It is a One Nation Issue, a fairness issue, an equality issue and an issue that has been ignored for far too long. Our boys’ underperformance at school deserves national attention and action. They, their teachers, parents, we as their Members of Parliament, and our Nation should expect nothing less.",

Hon. Friend for that answer. She’ll want to join me in welcoming the latest figures showing that employment in the North East, the North West and the East Midlands is all growing faster than in London. Will she ensure that this record of growth and prosperity outside of London continues, reflecting this Government’s One Nation approach?”\nThe Minister of State, Anna Soubry MP:\n“Can I just completely echo all the sentiments of the Hon. Gentleman, and absolutely agree with him. In fact between 2010 and 2014, 58% of net new jobs were created outside of London and the South East, whereas between 2004 and 2010 that was only 37% and, as I say, this is only further evidence of our long term economic plan working.”\nKarl McCartney MP (City of Lincoln):\n“Considering the growth of business opportunities in our County, and particularly the City of Lincoln, does the Minister think we could build on the recently announced £130 million investment in the University of Lincoln, a chief component of the Midlands engine, and grant us Enterprise Status?\nThe Minister of State, Anna Soubry MP:\n“I thank the Hon. Gentleman for his question, and I’m very happy to triumph Lincoln given it’s the City of my birth if I may say. In any event, I’m very happy to meet with him to talk about the future of the University and the real role it can play. As I’ve said before Mr. Speaker, forgive me for repeating it, I met all the representatives from the LEPs right across the Midlands, indeed we talked about Lincoln University and it’s real desire to create this Midland engine and rightly so.”\n- ENDS -\nFor further information, please contact Karl McCartney MP at [email protected] / 020 7219 7221.",

The heating is now back on, the nights are drawing in and some of the mornings are certainly fresher. Following the tremendous Referendum result in June there is also a freshness in Westminster, heightened by the various Conferences. This is matched by a freshness closer to home with recent improvements to the City of Lincoln’s transport system, the increasing vibrancy of our myriad businesses and of course, we have a new wave of students settling in to our two universities. They, along with all the other positive changes to our City will certainly add some seasonal colour and a huge welcome to them all.\nI have always been clear that in addition to representing the good people of my Lincoln constituency both locally and in Westminster and Whitehall, a Member of Parliament has a national role. It is important to seek to make a difference and raise issues that affect those in Lincoln, Lincolnshire and also across the United Kingdom. These issues should always be where there has been a lingering injustice, are just hovering into view or have been overlooked – sometimes on purpose. It is where a Member of Parliament can make a real difference.\nLast year, I campaigned on escalating false whiplash claims resulting from minor or deliberate vehicle accidents, fuelled by greedy personal injury lawyers playing the system. This year, amongst other issues I helped defeat the extension of Sunday trading hours in the spring, campaigned across Greater Lincolnshire and the East Midlands to secure our exit from the European Union in the early summer, and this autumn I am raising the issue of the underperformance of boys within our education system. This has been clearly a problem for 30 years or more.\nBoys are behind girls when it comes to exam results, becoming apprentices and going to university. We also need far more male teachers, and to retain those we already have. I recently led a debate in Parliament on this subject, have also written newspaper articles in the Telegraph and Guardian and elsewhere on the issue and have asked the Government to take some decisive positive action. I will be doing more over the coming months. We cannot continue to keep letting generations of boys and their families down. With Brexit thankfully happening soon, we need to make sure everyone can fulfil their potential.\nLocally, the City is moving apace and proving it is the jewel in the East Midlands crown, if not the whole Country. The past few years have seen a worthy celebration of the City’s past with the Magna Carta celebrations, the Lincoln Castle restoration and the coming transformation of the Lincoln Cathedral environs. The next few years is about putting the final pieces of the transport infrastructure jigsaw together so it is far easier to get in, out and around the City and in some cases bypass it altogether.\nWe have seen many improvements including recently the opening of an East-West Link road and vital railway footbridges in the centre of the City. We also have more to come including an Eastern Bypass and a central Lincoln transport hub. However, it is still not enough. It is why I, alongside Cllr Richard Davies who is responsible for transport across the whole County, held a successful transport summit earlier this month with all those with a big stake and a big say in Lincoln’s transport system invited to discuss a plethora of issues. For instance, we still need new pieces of infrastructure such as the Southern Relief Road, a fully dualled Western Bypass, a park and ride system, and more common sense traffic management systems in the City to help keep traffic moving. Positively, there were lots of areas of agreement, and a clear sense of urgency and strategy.\nThese twin roles, speaking up for the City of Lincoln and Lincolnshire in Westminster and Whitehall and championing national causes, is why being a Member of Parliament is so rewarding. In the coming months, I will keep readers up to date with progress on these fronts, and many more.",
  "https_www_karlmccartney_co_uk_/https_www_karlmccartney_co_uk_news_all-party-parliamentary-group-golf-annual-dinner/content_59.html": "Karl's speech to those at the All-Party Parliamentary Golf Group 2016 Annual Dinner\nThankyou for all coming tonight in the lovely surroundings of the Palace of Westminster for the first anniversary of the All Party Parliamentary Golf Group, which has the singular, and deliberately broad remit, of supporting the sport of golf.\nAgainst this background, we have been very active over the past year and tonight’s inaugural annual dinner is a fitting celebration of that work, and of an exciting year of golf.\nThe Group’s initial focus has been on increasing participation, particularly amongst women and BME groups, and also on improving the lazy and perhaps longstanding, and incorrect, perceptions of the sport.\nOne thing that has become clear since we formed the Group is the huge support for the sport across all four corners of our great Country and right across the full spectrum of our society. This is why we are delighted that so many of the various bodies that represent different sections of the sport we all enjoy are here this evening and if only we had the space tonight to invite everyone who enjoys the sport to this evening.\nAs many of you may know I am an enthusiastic player but not very accomplished, however I will always remember the day I broke ninety. A glorious sunny day so I went and had a few beers in the clubhouse that day and… you know… I was so excited I forgot to play the back nine…\nMore seriously, this year has certainly been an eventful year for golf in the UK.\nIn the professional game, the Women’s British Open returned to Woburn Golf and Country Club for the first time since 1999. Whilst there was no British winner, there have been some encouraging performances throughout the year, particularly from Charley Hull, and we hope to see a strong UK presence in Team Europe at next year’s Solheim Cup.\nThere was success in the men’s game as Danny Willett became the first British player to win the Masters since Nick Faldo in 1996, whilst Justin Rose won the gold medal for Great Britain at golf’s welcome return to the Olympics. The Open returned to Troon and was won by Henrik Stenson, and there was a home-grown winner of the PGA Championship at Virginia Water, Chris Wood. We won’t mention the Ryder Cup.\nIn the amateur game there was success for Great Britain and Ireland over the USA in the Curtis Cup, which the men’s team will be looking to repeat when they travel to Los Angeles for the 2017 Walker Cup. The Men’s British Amateur Championship was won by Scott Gregory from England, whilst the Women’s competition was won by Julia Engstrom from Sweden.\nAll of us I am sure are aware of the importance of encouraging young people to be active and participate in the sport – in fact in any sport. It is good to see many individuals in the room who are working hard to help drive junior participation in golf, and on behalf of the APPG can I say that the Group is delighted to be able to support the Golf Foundation through this dinner, and the excellent work that it does to encourage young people to play the game.\nSo what have we been doing here in Parliament?\nIn March the Group hosted a reception here on the HoC Terrace for The R&A, launching a report by Sheffield Hallam University’s Sports Industry Research Centre into the Economic Impact of Golf to the UK Economy. As Chairman of the Group I also held and led an Adjournment Debate in the House of Commons on the same topic.\nThe Group launched National Golf Month at an event in Parliament ON Speaker’s Green in April, which provided all Members of Parliament with an opportunity to see the excellent work being done in the sport at the community level, and to promote opportunities for people to participate in golf.\nWe also hosted an England Golf Partnership reception in Parliament on developing grassroots participation, and also showcased the “Get into Golf” initiative at the Parliamentary Sports Fair. Some of my fellow Members of Parliament golfing skills certainly had the tourists on Westminster Bridge ducking for cover.\nThe Group continues to be an active voice for the game at all levels, and have supported the campaign to stop the closure of Beckenham Place Park golf course by the Executive Mayor of Lewisham, as well as a variety of other issues across the Country affecting the sport of Golf.\nAnd we provide regular updates to stakeholders around the world about our public-facing activities.\nJust a brief word on our meetings in Parliamentary Meetings\nOur Parliamentary Group welcomes a range of individuals from all levels of golf to speak at its open meetings.\nThis can be seen over the past year where we have heard from\n- The National Golf Clubs’ Advisory Association,\n- The European Tour, and\n- England Golf and Sky Sports.\nAnd we look forward to hearing from many more of our stakeholders in the future.\nMuch of the Group’s work takes place between meetings, and Group Officers have had a plethora of meetings with those in and around the world and sport of golf on a myriad of issues.\nNo anniversary dinner would be complete without giving thanks to a number of key people and organisations.\nI would like to thank all of the Group’s supporters, without whose assistance the Group would not be able to deliver its aims and continue to challenge the issues surrounding golf.\nMy thanks to Covéa Insurance, especially to James Reader, for their support and for this dinner in particular.\nMy thanks also goes to:\n- The R&A,\n- England Golf,\n- The PGA, and,\n- Sky and Sports Publications for their continued support.\nThankyou too to all those Members who have supported golf, both in Parliament and outside.\nOur Associate Members also provide a crucial and critical insight into the challenges the sport faces at all levels. We are grateful to them for their continued support, and it is good to see so many here this evening. You all act as advocates for us at the APPG and the game itself – so thankyou to all of you and from my fellow Officers and I from both Houses of Parliament.\nI would like to say this all would not have been possible without the dedication and hard work of both Jack Baker and Mark Ramsdale.\nMy final thoughts are to urge everyone to become more involved and urge others too as well.\nWe welcome input and everyone here is welcome to join the Group.\nWe do need your support if we are to continue our work, so please speak to me, my Parliamentary colleagues in the room, Mark Ramsdale or Jack Baker about joining or becoming involved on a supporting basis.\nI leave you with a couple of thoughts:\n- The first is that I learnt an important lesson about golf on the Torksey course just to the North of Lincoln – it is that golf is actually played on a very small fairway – that’s about 4 inches wide and stretches between your ears…\n- There is also the old quote that the difference between golf and Government is that in golf you can't improve your lie. With what’s happened in the world of politics in 2016 it is hard to know what is fact or fiction in some cases – or what the future holds, or where things might end up…",

This includes:\n- a £20 million Rough Sleeping Fund to help new rough sleepers, or people at imminent risk of sleeping rough, get the rapid support they need to recover and move on from a rough sleeping crisis;\n- £10 million of funding for Social Impact Bonds to provide targeted support for vulnerable, entrenched single homeless people. This will build on the success of the world’s first homelessness Social Impact Bond in London; and\n- £20 million for local authorities to trial new initiatives as Prevention Trailblazers, working with a wider group of at risk people to help families and individuals before they reach crisis point.\nLocal authorities in Lincolnshire will be a direct beneficiary of Social Impact Bonds receiving a total of £1,251,800.\nAcross all three funds, the Government awarded funding to 84 projects working across 225 local authorities in England, to ensure that more people have tailored support to avoid becoming homeless in the first place, and the rapid support they need to make a sustainable recovery from homelessness. Local authorities will be able to use this funding to bring together a range of local partners to provide an innovative approach to tackling homelessness, with prevention at its heart.\nIn addition the Government are supporting Bob Blackman MP’s Homelessness Reduction Bill, which will significantly reform England’s homelessness legislation and ensure that more people receive the help they need to prevent a homelessness crisis in the first place.\nKarl McCartney JP MP, Lincoln’s Member of Parliament, said: “I was delighted to learn that various local authorities in Lincolnshire, including Lincolnshire County Council, the City of Lincoln Council and North Kesteven District Council who directly serve my City of Lincoln Constituency, will receive a total of £1,251,800 to provide targeted support for vulnerable, entrenched single homeless people.\n“Our Homelessness Prevention Programme, the measures set out in the Homelessness Reduction Bill and our £100 million funding for move-on accommodation will make a huge difference to the lives of the most vulnerable in Lincoln and our society more generally. But there is more work to do across Government and in local areas to ensure that services work effectively together to support people into more independent lives, and prevent people from becoming homeless in the first place. That’s why I will continue to combat the scourge of homelessness in our City.”\n- ENDS -\nFor further information, please contact Karl McCartney JP MP at [email protected] / 020 7219 7221.",
  "https_www_karlmccartney_co_uk_/https_www_karlmccartney_co_uk_news_belvoir-lettings-lincoln-landlord-seminar/content_33.html": "Thankyou Paul for inviting me here tonight and thankyou to everyone for coming to hear my reflections on Brexit and all of the issues and opportunities that it brings, and of course how I feel that reflects and impacts on the private rented sector. I will also touch upon the Housing Sector more widely and answer any questions at the end.\nAs many of you know I voted and campaign to Leave, primarily because I wanted to bring back control of our laws, taxes, borders and regulations, but also because I believe it will have a positive impact on our City, County and Country.\nAs the Article 50 letter has been safely received in Brussels, alongside the publication of the Great Repeal Bill and the White Paper, it is important not to keep going over past arguments and debates on whether we should Leave or Remain, we need to look to the future now and make it work. We all have an exciting future if we stay positive.\nHowever, there is always a downside and for me it is in Parliament because it is clear that elements of Labour, Liberal Democrats and the SNP still do not want Brexit to happen, at all, and cannot look to the future.\nYou only have to see how they behave on the issue. Of course we all want and need scrutiny, which is why I put myself forward to be elected as a member of the Brexit Select Committee as scrutiny is as important in a democracy as the decisions themselves. But the tone, anger and behaviour of those who oppose Brexit is as bad as you will ever see. It is playground, or student politics stuff, and I believe they will wage another two years of this type of guerrilla warfare in Parliament, which risks damaging our economy, of that I have no doubt. This is not because it is in the interests of our people, our businesses and our landlords, but for purely selfish political reasons, and this is worth you all following as I am sure you will over the coming weeks, months and years ahead.\nThe National Landlords Association regularly surveys its members about Brexit and their latest finding in the East Midlands were 14% were positive about Brexit and 35% were concerned, with over half believing it will make no difference. So I come with a message of reassurance.\nThe reason for setting this out upfront is that broadly speaking there will not be any direct consequences of Brexit on the private rented sector and having spoken to the National Landlords Association this week, they confirmed that to be the case. This is because housing and planning policy has always been under the remit of national Governments, one of the few areas left untouched by the long arms of the EU and the Commission. From my experience being untouched by the European Union, when you are still a member is always fraught with danger as it does not take much for this to be negotiated away and then the tentacles of Brussels will be all over you all in an instant.\nHowever of course there will be lots of indirect areas of where the decision to leave the European Union will have an effect on landlords.\nThe first area is of course the economy. The Bank of England is predicting growth of 2% in our economy this year, higher than the 1.4% they predicted at the end of 2016 and of course far higher than they produced before the Referendum - when they said the world would end overnight. I hope that their powers of prediction have sharpened somewhat over the past year.\nI do not need to tell you that a buoyant economy with record numbers of people in employment, means a healthy demand for people to rent, good rental income and access to investment capital. Once Brexit is fully up and running and we have negotiated trade deals with the rest of the world as well as the European Union, I am confident that this economic growth will continue and hopefully increase a touch.\nA 2%-3% growth rate is a good stable platform for any country – too fast a growth rate can create inflation and instability, and a lower rate can cause uncertainty, negativity and create the conditions for an actual recession. A healthy economy also means lowering the number of people on universal credit or housing benefits and also reduces the risks of any further increases in landlord taxation or tax relief reductions which I know many of you are having to endure from Saturday.\nAn additional area will be around immigration, and hopefully a slowing down of the population growth into the country, not just from people already here but also from immigration. Population growth caused by net immigration is at the moment the equivalent of a new city the size of Nottingham or Leicester every single year, and the challenge is where are these people going to live? No wonder housing growth cannot keep up, leading to higher housing prices and costs as well as general strain on our public services.\nHalf of the net immigration is from outside of the European Union so hopefully when we have new immigration controls in place, we will be able to reduce immigration overall. This is obviously important when it comes to dealing with the Right to Rent checks that you as landlords have to take part in and also demand for private rental accommodation more widely. I hope it will also deal with rogue landlords who house far too many people in a single household. This being a distinct problem in areas of our County.\nIn this City where I expect many of you house students from our two universities and the Colleges, I do not see any new border controls having an impact on the numbers of international students, so there should be no decrease in demand. This is especially the case as the Government has made it quite clear that this Country will always remain a welcoming place for foreign students.\nI lastly just wanted to touch on housing more broadly. It has been clear for at least a couple of decades now that housing policy and the sector in general is not working, and if the housing sector is not working, our Country is not working to the best it can.\nHouse prices are far too high, if the asking prices are being achieved, and if I am being honest, rents are probably too high, which itself is a direct result of the house prices being too high.\nThe cost of housing as a percentage of average incomes is now nearly 50% whether you buy or rent, and people are living at home with their parents for longer which I do not think is a good thing and in fact it is not fair to our younger generation – for those of you of a certain age you are probably thinking – hey Karl, it is not fair on the older generation either…\nWe, I presume, are aware we in the UK are not building enough homes which I know the Government is starting to now really force a change of pace on this. Though they do have to be in the right place and I have real fears about building houses on floodplains which the City Council seems hell bent on doing in their promised Swanpool Development to the West of Lincoln. I am not reassured at all that this is the right thing to do.\nI further recognise that overall the Government may not be the flavour of the month in the private rented sector when it comes to changes in tax relief, checks on the right to rent and a future ban on upfront fees for letting agents. Where the Government is coming from though is to try and rebalance the system - which has been moved away too much from home ownership in the past two decades. The ideal is to have a housing economy where more people have the choice whether to buy or rent and that there is both inter-generational fairness and a sense of fair play.\nAs in all sectors, people like yourselves who care about the homes you rent and the tenants you rent to, can feel as though you are being singled out, but it is the rogue landlords the Government is after.\nWith 20% of households now living in private rented sector across the Country, the Government has to be sure that such an important part of our housing economy is working well. While I have heard the concerns that the sector has about a lack of a general co-ordinated Government plan for the private rented sector, I hope that is changing and in fact the National Landlords’ Association does recognise that this Prime Minister is listening to the sector whilst that did not happen perhaps as much under the previous Prime Minister and Ministers.\nLastly, I would like to thankyou all for making sure people in Lincoln and the County have good homes to live in and that we have that flexibility in housing that we need. Even more so, with such a large student population who may only be here for three years, I want to make sure they are in well-maintained houses. The same is said for our young professionals and those coming to work here for short periods due to the international manufacturing base in the area. The private rented sector is a sector that adds real value to this City, a City that is booming and has become the most loved city in the whole of the East Midlands. You are all playing an invaluable part in the Lincoln Success Story of today – and for that I thankyou.",
  "https_www_karlmccartney_co_uk_/https_www_karlmccartney_co_uk_news_lincoln-civic-trust-agm-speech/content_43.html": "Thank you Mr Chairman for inviting me to your Annual General Meeting today and it is a real pleasure to have been asked to speak on a subject that is very close to my heart.\nI have too been saddened by the news earlier this week regarding former Conservative City Councillor Richard and Mary Lucas and I wish to pass on my condolences to their family. Certainly much of what I will say this evening is a tribute to the work that he undertook as your former President.\nThere is no doubt that Lincoln is the cultural heart of our Country\nAbout 450 years BC, the Greek Statesman, Pericles said, just because you do not take an interest in politics doesn't mean politics won't take an interest in you. So nearly fifteen years ago, I sat down with my wife Cordelia to decide what constituencies I would like to apply to become a Member of Parliament for, and what the criteria should be. With 650 to potentially to choose from, this was no easy feat.\nPretty near the top of the wish list was to stand for a recognised constituency that had played a pivotal role in the history and life of this great Country, that celebrated and promoted this history and also a constituency that had a real civic ethic - where those that lived there took a full part in protecting and promoting its heritage.\nIt would come as no surprise that at the top of the list was Lincoln. Which was why I was delighted, and maybe surprised myself, to have been selected to stand for Parliament here in 2005, going on to win in 2010 and winning again last year.\nLincoln really is a City that stands apart from everywhere else and it was only when I had to give my Maiden speech in the House of Commons, that the full significance of where I was representing really became apparent. Traditionally, when a Member of Parliament gives their Maiden speech, they spend five minutes talking about the seat they represent, it is one of those traditions that has lasted centuries.\nAnd indeed it was apparent in Parliament that Lincoln is not just another name in the list of 650 constituencies. It is a City that plays and will continue to play a pivotal role in our nation’s history, heritage and democratic tradition. In fact, in the year I was elected, Lincoln became the oldest constituency in continuous existence in the United Kingdom having been established in 1265.\nWhen I spoke in Parliament, I explained that Edward III presided over a Parliament in our Cathedral, in fact Parliament met in Lincoln three times 1301, 1316 and 1328 and I went on to remind everyone that the Cathedral is one of the glories of English architecture, particularly remarked on by Pevsner, dominating the City and a large swathe of the County. It is still as impressive today as when it stood as the tallest building in the world for 238 years—the only building in the UK ever to have held that title.\nI even offered that if my Government ever feel the need, I am sure that Lincoln will be willing again to host a meeting of Parliament or of the Cabinet at a date of their choosing. Given the fact that Parliament may well soon need to move out of the Palace of Westminster for six years while it is urgently being repaired, this is an idea I will be pushing for – but I fear only a meeting of the Cabinet in the City again may become a reality.\nAnd with so much that Lincoln has given to this Country and the heritage that we have here, it is hard to promote everything but the significance of the 800th anniversary of the Magna Carta should never be underestimated.\nWhile the Magna Carta celebrations were a reminder of the City’s past, they also acted as a reminder that the same values, customs and principles that serve us so well today – especially free elections, the Rule of Law and Habeas Corpus. This historic charter has not just laid the foundation stones of our City; it is the foundation stone of our Country and much of the World.\nAnd our Magna Carta Year was a reminder of the history of the democracy we live in - and perhaps a happy coincidence that it was also a General Election year – more exciting for some of us than others maybe... And it is why Lincoln was marked by a visit from the Prime Minister David Cameron and the Rt. Hon. William Hague in April last year to launch the English Manifesto of my Party - which has now thankfully been placed into Law.\nAs I am sure you all know Lincoln Castle is now the only place in the world where an original 1215 Magna Carta and the smaller charter, the 1217 Charter of the Forest can be seen side by side, on permanent loan from Lincoln Cathedral. The Barons came to signify the 800th celebration of the Magna Carta across Lincoln and I am sure the knights on their horses are going to do the same next year as we celebrate the Charter of the Forest in much the same way. These examples are telling because while history shows us that it is ideas that shape the world, without the physical representation and physical protection of those ideas, they would be far harder to protect and preserve, far harder to be accessible and far harder to be passed from one generation to the other.\nAnd this is why preserving and protecting our cultural heritage in Lincoln is so important. Would the World be able to view the Magna Carta and Charter of the Forest 800 years after they were written without both Lincoln Castle and Lincoln Cathedral?\nThis also demonstrates why the work of Lincoln Civic Trust is so vital because while apart from foreign invaders who have always wanted to destroy key buildings such as our Castle and Cathedral, I do not need to tell you that Lincoln is not just about those historical landmarks it is about so much more.\nThe fact that we still have the nationally iconic Jews House, St Benedict’s Church and St Mary’s Guildhall is testament to the work of the Civic Trust and its forbears. These and all those other historic buildings and civic amenities come together to make Lincoln the special City it is today just as it has been so special for previous centuries, and a City that is very much the heart of this Country. No wonder we see tourist numbers increase year on year.\nSo I believe all of us have a duty to be Looking after our City’s future\nI am doing all I can to continue to place Lincoln at the heart of this County and Country by ensuring Lincoln is better connected to our Country’s major road and rail networks. We need more direct train links to and from Lincoln and today’s news this morning shows we will see an increase by 2019 albeit I fear not as many trains as I would have liked – but with a link taking only 100 minutes between our great City and Kings Cross Station in the village of London, I am pleased we are heading in the right direction in the 21st Century. We also need more road bypasses so that unneeded traffic does not gridlock the City and I will continue to put pressure on the City and County Councils to create a comprehensive Park & Ride scheme that serves no just commuters or visitors to the City, welcome though they are – it must also assist residents in travelling around the City and its environs that they grew up and live in. Other cities have such a scheme so why not Lincoln? The new footbridges over the railway lines will also stop the City being cut in two by level crossings.\nI have also been a keen supporter of the increase in hotel accommodation and the fact that Double Tree Hilton Group had the confidence to build such a superb hotel at Brayford Pool is testament to the direction upwards of the City, along with the other new hotels we have seen appear over recent years.\nAnd with the continual pace of growth and development in the City fuelled by the University, our manufacturing base, our growing creative industries and the great overall environment here, Lincoln continues to be an engine of success and prosperity in the East Midlands and also across the UK.\nDuring the General Election campaign, last year I was invited by the Creative Hope graphic design studio, right in the heart of the City on Silver Street, to discuss the work of a Member of Parliament. Those who set up the Agency had come here from London and their work was amazing, employing local people from the College and University, winning contracts from around the Country and County and producing designs that were breathtaking. They are a key example of the modern creativity this City has to offer and they revel in the inspiration the old and stunning building they occupy offers them all.\nThe need to preserve our heritage comes under pressure from new developments, including where we find something new from our past such as the Roman Burial Ground found recently and then at the other extreme the Councils have preserved 11 sites Uphill to ensure we have the right limestone to help repair the Castle and Cathedral for a few more centuries.\nWhile our preserving of our history is vital, no City can stand still and still be relevant. And it is why when I see and visit the great cultural activities in the City - the concerts, the plays, the arts and even the great comedy, I realise this is a City that has one eye on the past and one on the future. It is a City that proudly combines the old and the new, its past and its future and both conservation and creation.\nOccasionally though the City Planners do get it wrong, historically the Eastgate Hotel was a boil, perhaps even an abscess, on the face of Lincoln, the vista around the Cathedral, and everyone welcomed the re-facing and renovations that this modern building has undergone to soften the impact on the built environment it inhabits.\nElsewhere the arrival of the University has seen great steps forward for the City, especially around developments on tainted areas of the City, but some historical views have not been protected; some aspects of new development by the University itself are incongruous and out of place, the architects’ building is to my mind uninspiring, incongruous and looks ike a ship in a desert, and some of the various accommodation blocks quite Stalinist, and some of the associated developments have been huge and cityscape changing. The planners, and City Councillors were and are responsible for these mishaps, that we all now have to live with.\nThe planners also missed the opportunity to help the business economy and to take a more rounded and long-term view by seeing the problems created by dragging students home along the north side of the Brayford on their way back from enjoying the night-time economy of Lincoln. Despite triple glazing it cannot be right that some of our best and most modern hotels find their guests asking not for rooms with views of the Brayford (a natural assumption) because of the noise well into the early hours of the next morning that disturbs their sleep and tranquil visit and hotel stay on our genteel, traditional Cathedral City, instead they opt for a room at the back of the hotel overlooking the car park…\nFurther some of our heritage has disappeared for ever – one of the reasons I publicly countered the University plans for the pea warehouse by the Brayford Pool that the City Councillors couldn’t wait to pass was that although it wasn’t the best architectural building to preserve, it was a surviving link to the industrial past of our City and the Brayford Pool’s history as a port and trading post for the County – it cannot be replaced and it is a sad loss.\nAnd whilst criticising some of the University’s ivory towers, I am well aware it is the University of Lincoln which provides so much of this modern life our City now enjoys, and considering it was not a University until 2002, it is an amazing achievement that it is now one of the top 50 Universities in the UK. In fact, when I was applying to go to College in the late 1980’s, Lincoln was not even on the list. Having such a University here combining with our long standing seat of learning, and now second niversity, Bishop Grossteste, is a vital part of the City’s Culture and future and something we should never want to lose.\nThe importance of Lincoln Civic Trust cannot be underestimated\nThese pieces of the Lincoln jigsaw I have so far outlined are all very well on their own, but it takes someone, or an entity, to pull the pieces together to create the whole picture and to tell the whole Lincoln Story. And this is why the work of the Lincoln Civic Trust, since its inauguration in 1953, has been so vital in the past to the City and will continue to be as vital to the City’s future.\nYour role in aiding the preservation of our City cannot be underestimated, developing our public amenities and promoting our arts is a role that cannot be under-played or overlooked. Your work in co-operating with the Councils and of course applying pressure when needed is something both the City and County should be thankful for. This City is the historic, artistic and cultural flame in the heart of the County and you are the Keeper of that Flame.\nI firmly believe that The Government’s Recognition of Culture is clearly evident\nThe significance of our national and local heritage is something that can never be ignored and this Government is certainly alive to its value. So much so that just two months ago, it published a Culture White Paper, the first for over 50 years and given this year is the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare’s death the timing is perfect.\nIt sets out the Government’s vision, strategy and proposals for the cultural sectors such as the arts, museums and galleries, libraries, archives and heritage and recognises there are three key themes where the value of heritage and culture combine.\nFirstly it has intrinsic value and the Government defines this as enriching the value of culture in and of itself.\nIndeed, evidence suggests that culture has an intrinsic value through the positive impact on personal wellbeing. This research shows that engaging with culture through visiting, attending and participation significantly increases overall life satisfaction.\nSecondly, it adds social value such as improving educational attainment and helping people to be healthier. There is considerable evidence of the beneficial effects of the arts on both physical and mental health.\nThis includes improvements on clinical outcomes, decreasing the amount of time spent in hospital and improving mental health more widely.\nEvidence also shows that engaging in culture can increase the likelihood of a young person going on to further and higher education\nLastly, it has clear economic value with a significant contribution to economic growth and job-creation.\nIn 2014, the economic contribution of museums, galleries, libraries and the arts was £5.4 billion – 60% higher than in 2010. Heritage Tourism dwarfs this though and contributes £26 billion per year.\nOverall the number of people employed in the cultural and creative sectors has been increasing since 2011 and now stands at 321,000. A thriving economy in general is good news for heritage, culture and the arts because people have more disposable income which means they are more likely to spend money and time wanting to go enjoy these activities – it is a self-fulfilling cycle.\nThe Paper also establishes a review to examine how Church buildings and Cathedrals in England can become more financially sustainable and Lincoln has certainly led the way with the newly announced £16 million renovation project which is expected to draw an extra 125,000 visitors a year to Lincoln Cathedral by 2020. This is in addition to the £22 million project just finished at the Castle, and various grants and awards I have helped Lincoln buildings secure from the Heritage Lottery people and Government .\nObviously the Government is very active in the field, funding organisations like English Heritage, protecting buildings of special architectural or historic interest and protecting nationally important sites but this White Paper is really important to pulling all of these threads together.\nOf particular interest are sections on the Government’s commitments to support Historic England in establishing new Heritage Action Zones like the one created in Boston.\nIt also wants to encourage local authorities and property owners to make more empty spaces and buildings available for cultural activities on a temporary basis and encourage them to consider cultural elements, such as artists’ studios, when planning new developments. I think that this could add real value to our City.\nI would recommend members of the Civic Trust read the paper, it’s on the Government’s website called The Culture White Paper and see how the themes and detail can further enhance Lincoln, it is even perhaps worth summarising it and briefing the Council and others on it.\nCertainly, I can see no reason why Lincoln should not bid to be the next City of Culture in 2021. Next year’s City of Culture is Hull so there is no reason why Lincoln should not be chosen – I am not sure the City has ever made a Bid. It should do. I was aware late in the day that a few years ago we made a bid for World Heritage Site Status – and made the long list of 38 but progressed no further. I made enquiries and took a delegation to meet those in Liverpool who had led a similar bid and had been successful and their advice was very useful and the examples of work they had done very comprehensive. I would hope in the future a similar but better resourced and ultimately more successful bid was brought together, I think we have all the constituent parts that would see such a successful and City enhancing development on the international stage.\nSo Ladies and Gentleman, I view myself as a traditional Conservative and it is why I am on the side of everyone in the City who wants to not only conserve the brilliant culture and heritage we have in the City, but want to celebrate it and also promote it to people all around the world. Contrary to that I am not against modernisation, but measured and appropriate modernisation I can support and welcome wholeheartedly. As I have said before this City is very much alive combining the old and the new, the past and the future and the need for both conservation and creation is evident wherever we look. My role is to enhance the City I have the honour and privilege to represent and to have enjoyed living in. I do not say there is anything wrong with our City, it is a beautiful and restful, traditional and friendly City, my role is to help it improve and develop in the right way as I see it. Unfortunately I do not see some of the usual suspects having the same ideals, whether they be representatives of companies, organisations or groups or Council representatives, they naturally have vested interests that sometimes take far too much precedence.\nHowever, without the work of the Lincoln Civic Trust protecting, preserving and promoting our culture and heritage, this great City would be a much poorer place. So thank you to each and everyone of you for everything you do, for listening to what I have to say and thankyou for inviting me to speak at your Annual General Meeting and I look forward to a lively question and answer session with you – but do remember some pubs still close at 11 o’clock…",
  "https_www_karlmccartney_co_uk_/https_www_karlmccartney_co_uk_news_overwhelming-support-bringing-back-refreshed-and-traditional-lincoln-christmas-market/content_8.html": "Results from a survey organised by Lincoln MP, Karl McCartney MP, to residents in Lincoln, Greater Lincolnshire and from elsewhere in the UK, show overwhelming support for bringing back the world-renowned Lincoln Christmas Market. This was closed in secret by the City Council last year and they have refused to even contemplate bringing it back in a revised form.\nThe online and paper-based survey results show a clear consensus that a refreshed Christmas Market should be spread over a number of weekends (instead of the one as previously was the case) and should be spread further across the City. This would help resolve previous issues about congestion and public safety. There were also views suggesting the market should also be more Lincolnshire-focused with an emphasis on local art, crafts, farmers and traders.\nThis and other information was presented at a meeting with key City stakeholders on Saturday morning in Lincoln who have come together to find a way forward on bringing the Market back. The City Council refused to attend. However, they are obviously welcome to attend future meetings and would be greeted as a positive partner.\nHighlights from the survey conducted in December 2023 which included over 600 Lincoln responses were:\n- 90% did not agree with the decision to permanently close Lincoln Christmas Market;\n- 89% believed the closure of the Christmas Market will have a negative impact on the reputation of Lincoln (93% from those in Greater Lincolnshire);\n- 94% said the closure will impact local businesses and shops;\n- 93% said the closure will impact tourism;\n- 80% said the closure will impact local jobs;\n- 62% of respondents said they visited every year and 27% most years;\n- 65% said their visit lasted 2-4 hours, 19% 1-2 hours and 9% said all day (this was a popular answer for those outside of Lincoln/Greater Lincolnshire);\n- The average amount spent was £58 overall with higher figures for those from across the UK (£71);\n- In terms of what changes need to be made, the most popular answers were for it to be spread over a number of weekends like in other cities and also for it to be spread further across the City. Over 70% of respondents mentioned this whilst there was little support for ticketing and for no changes. There was also support for a more Lincolnshire-focused market with an emphasis on local arts, crafts, farmers and traders.\nIt was recognised that the Christmas Market not only brought visitors to the City for the four day period, it also serves Lincoln all year round. This is due to market visitors being ‘reminded’ to come back at other times to enjoy the City’s museums, galleries, independent shops and heritage.\nKarl McCartney MP, who always Puts Lincoln First, said: “The survey results are clear that the public in Lincoln and elsewhere want our Christmas Market back in a refreshed and more traditional format.\n“The decision made by the City Council to permanently close has been a monumental mistake and the public recognises it has damaged our reputation, tourism, jobs, businesses and charities.\n“What is also clear is that positive changes can be made so that it can be brought back safely. There is a clear common-sense view that the Christmas Market should be spread over more weekends and further across the City Centre. It should also be far more Lincolnshire-focused with an emphasis on our local art, crafts, farmers and traders.\n“A positive meeting at the weekend was held with a wide range of local stakeholders including business groups and we will be continuing to pursue solutions on bringing our wonderful Christmas Market back.\n“The City Council has a golden opportunity to rethink its position especially when it is so out of step with what the public and businesses want. It is time to put political differences aside and all of us work for the greater good of the City and County. Which means creating a refreshed and traditional Lincoln Christmas Market.”",
  "https_www_karlmccartney_co_uk_/https_www_karlmccartney_co_uk_key-achievements/content_55.html": "When I was first elected in 2010, I pledged that I would always stick to my commitment of “Putting Lincoln First”\nI would always ensure the voices of my Constituents were heard in Westminster as well as ensuring our wonderful City received the improvements it rightly deserved.\nAs I reiterated on the tenth anniversary of my Maiden Speech in Parliament, my priority was focussed on: “...enhancing and improving the infrastructure of our City and the surrounding areas as we all benefit through better education, work opportunities and transport links, be that if we live, work, study or are just visiting the lovely constituency of Lincoln and its position as the gateway to the greater County of Lincolnshire”.\nThe list below sets out a range of these achievements.\nWhilst a number of the big projects have been completed or are starting, given the increasing popularity and importance of the City as a place to live, work, study and visit - there will always be a more to support. Time never stands still in Lincoln as it remains as vibrant today as it was when the Romans were here. Tomorrow will be no different.\nKEY ACHIEVEMENTS FOR LINCOLN, SKELLINGTHORPE, BRACEBRIDGE HEATH & WADDINGTON EAST\nTRANSPORT\nKarl led the campaign to create a ring road around the City – despite being told when first elected in 2010, that this was unachievable. This will be in place by the end of this decade.\nFurthermore, he has banged on Conservative Minister’s doors, led and supported campaigns, and always passionately argued the case for significant improvements. This includes new rail services, a new bus station, building railway pedestrian crossings and other improvements including tackling traffic bottlenecks.\nThe fact already that in January 2023, the Conservative Government has agreed to provide £20 million to fund the essential new traffic bridge between Skellingthorpe Road to Tritton Road is clear proof of Karl’s effectiveness as the Member of Parliament for Lincoln.\nAt a national level and as a senior member of the Transport Select Committee in Parliament, Karl has led the campaign against the so-called ‘Smart Motorways’ introduced originally by a Labour Government. The current Government, due to political pressure from Karl and others, has decided to build no more and are currently undertaking a review.\nKarl has also been successful in playing a leading national role in stopping the plans that would no longer allow new petrol/diesel cars and vans to be sold from 2030. This has now successfully been pushed back to 2035.\nLincoln “Ring Road”\nKarl led the support with Lincolnshire County Council for the creation of a £122 million Lincoln Eastern bypass connecting the A158 Wragby Road with the A15 Sleaford Road. Opened in December 2020 and often referred to by many, as “McCartney Way”.\nHe also ensured the dualling of sections of the Western Bypass (A46/A15) around Lincoln. These sections were finished in 2013.\nKarl worked closely with Lincolnshire County Council in securing £110 million from the Government to fund the North Hykeham Relief Road (Southern Bypass) linking the new Lincoln Eastern Bypass with the existing Western Bypass. This will create a ring road around Lincoln and will be completed by the end of the decade.\nOther Road Improvements\nKarl has actively campaigned for the Conservative Government to provide £20 million to fund the essential new traffic bridge between Skellingthorpe Road and Tritton Road. The Government agreed this in January 2023, and it would not have happened without Karl’s leadership.\nHe has supported the increase in capacity and improvements in traffic flow at the A46 Riseholme roundabout which included an extra lane alongside the extra entrance and exit lanes at all approaches and exits. The work was completed in 2020.\nHe also secured funding from the Government for the £22 million East-West Link Road in the centre of Lincoln thereby providing a direct link from the High Street (at its junction with Tentercroft Street) to Pelham Bridge and Canwick Road. This meant traffic can bypass the City Centre’s level crossings. This was opened in 2016.\nKarl has also successfully pushed for the funding of a range of bottleneck and pinch-point improvements including the upgrading of both the top and bottom of the hill on Canwick Road in the South-East, and Brant Road / Rookery Lane & Newark Road in the South-West. These works were completed in 2015.\nLincoln Transport Hub\nKarl fully supported the creation of the Lincoln Transport Hub including persuading the Department of Transport to contribute £11 million to the project. This included a new bus station. The new transport hub was fully opened in 2018.\nHe supported the introduction of the successful Park and Ride scheme from the north of Lincoln into the City Centre. This was opened in 2017.\nRailway Improvements (including pedestrian crossings)\nAs soon as he was first elected in 2010, he ensured there were direct trains again from Lincoln to London. These started in 2011 and there have been continual improvements which Karl has campaigned for including directly lobbying the rail companies.\nHe has improved cross-country train services, especially at weekends connecting Lincoln to the rest of the East Midlands, Lincolnshire and South Yorkshire. Karl is actively supporting the introduction of quicker speeds on these lines.\nKarl led the campaign for the Lincoln High Street footbridge to be built by the level crossing, therefore allowing pedestrians to cross the railway line safely 24/7. This was opened in 2016.\nHe also campaigned to persuade Network Rail to fund an aesthetically pleasing pedestrian bridge over the railway by Lincoln's Brayford Wharf East. This was opened in 2019.\nEDUCATION\n------------------\nSecuring Lincoln’s position as one of the Country’s leading national education centres has and always been a priority for Karl, given the brilliant universities, colleges and schools in the City. Below is a list of just some of his key achievements.\nKarl worked with and fully supported Bishop Grosseteste University in being conferred university status in 2012.\nHe has supported the expansion of the City’s two prestigious Universities (16,000+ students) whilst encouraging them to play a fuller role in the business and civic life of Lincoln.\nHe played a full role in campaigning for the creation of Lincoln Medical School at Lincoln University which was opened in 2021.\nHe also campaigned for and supported the creation of the first new Engineering School in the UK for 20 years at the University of Lincoln.\nHe has been supporting the growing success of Lincoln College including its ground-breaking Air and Defence College. Karl has also successfully campaigned for more investment in further education and apprenticeships across the City.\nThe Conservative Government, which Karl fully supports, has continued to invest in Lincolnshire’s primary and secondary schools with continuing increases in funding. This can be also seen with recent increased funding for buildings such as at Lincoln Castle Academy, Lincoln Manor Leas' Junior and Infants schools, and Bracebridge Heath St John's Primary Academy.\nKarl worked with the Government to bring up school standards, so the vast majority of schools in Lincolnare rated as Outstanding or Good by Ofsted.\nHe has also supported new facilities which have been funded by the Conservative Government recently such as the new St Giles Community Centre , new community facilities at the LNER Stadium and a brand new school, St Christopher’s Primary School[BM4] on Skellingthorpe Road.\nHEALTH AND SOCIAL CARE\n--------------------------------------\nKarl has always championed the need for further investment in local health services and social care. Supporting further investment in Lincoln County Hospital and improving its performance remains a key priority. Below is a list of just some of his key achievements.\nHe, with a Conservative Government has successfully ensured that Lincoln will have its first new Testing Centre (Community Diagnostic Centre).\nHe successfully lobbied the Conservative Government to increase funding and support for Lincoln County Hospital including:\n- £7 million investment in the A&E facilities\n- new mental health wards\n- new investment into the neonatal intensive care unit\n- new mobile breast cancer screening unit\nKarl campaigned for and supported the creation of Lincoln Medical School at Lincoln University which was opened in 2021.\nHe also supported the creation of a Centre for Innovation in Rural Health in the heart of Lincoln with an investment announced in 2020 of £1.3 million.\nKarl successfully lobbied the Conservative Government to help with rough sleeping in the City with a positive result in 2020 when the Government gave the City Council over £1 million to support some of the most vulnerable people in our community.\nHERITAGE AND CULTURE\n-----------------------------------\nKarl is a champion of the City’s wonderful heritage given it is the jewel in the crown not only within the East Midlands but across the whole of the UK too.\nAs a Member of Parliament, he has always campaigned and supported new investment and raised the profile of the City’s history and culture – making it a key tourist destination for visitors from across the UK and the world.\nHis many and wide-ranging achievements in this area are set out below:\nHe successfully lobbied the Conservative Government to provide Lincoln with £19 million at the end of March 2020 from its Towns Deal Fund. This is supporting 14 projects from the restoration of the Central Market in the heart of the City, the restoration of Greyfriars and also the re-opening and redevelopment of the Drill Hall. This is in addition to the funding for a range of other key projects including funding to support the redevelopment of the Cornhill Quarter.\nHe championed the wonderful Lincoln Cathedral including backing successful Lottery bids for the Lincoln Cathedral Connected project and for Government investment to support repairs and its upkeep.\nKarl also supported extra investment and helped raise the profile of Lincoln Castle including the Magna Carta Centre which was opened on the 800th anniversary of the Magna Carta. A 1215 copy of the Magna Carta can be found next to the 1217 Charter of the Forest at Lincoln Castle which is the only place in the world where the two documents can be seen side by side.\nKarl is a champion for more tourism into the City and as well as the above, he promotes the Museum of Lincolnshire Life, The Collection and especially The Usher Gallery.\nKarl also recognises the importance of civic life in the City and has always supported the Civic Trust, the various Rotary Clubs of Lincoln and the hundreds of community groups that enrich the life of the City.\nAs Lincoln's Member of Parliament, Karl supported the need for the Conservative Government’s Covid-19 Culture Recovery Fund to include Lincoln’s thriving arts community which has seen nine arts organisations receiving over £300,000 in support. In addition, twelve churches in the Lincoln diocese have received £1.8 million, and Lincoln Cathedral has received £1.2 million from this fund.\nHe has played a key role in opposing the Labour Party’s terrible decision to close the world-famous Lincoln Christmas Market, damaging businesses, tourism and the reputation of the City. As he has said: “Our Christmas Market is part of the city's rich heritage as much as the cathedral, castle and the Romans. To cancel it will clearly damage tourism, traders and Lincoln's way of life. It is a shallow, stupid and shoddy decision.”\nHe carried out important research on the Christmas Market and the clear consensus is that it should be spread over a number of weekends, spead further across the City and to be more ‘Lincolnshire’ with an emphasis on local traders, businesses, arts, craft, charities and farmers.\nCRIME AND POLICING\n-------------------------------\nKarl has resisted attempts to close Lincoln Prison and has campaigned for the Government to invest in extra prison places, thereby helping to reduce overcrowding.\nKarl has ensured the delivery of the Conservative Government’s 2019 manifesto for an extra 20,000 police officers. This has included ensuring that Lincoln and Lincolnshire as a whole gain their fair share of Police funding. Over 160 extra police officers have been recruited since the end of 2019.\nBUSINESS INVESTMENT AND JOBS\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nKarl has continuously championed the case for more funding into the City and is currently a member of Lincoln’s Town Deal Board.\nRecent investments that Karl has championed include:\n- £19 million from the Conservative Government’s Towns Fund deals announced in the 2021 Budget which are supporting 14 projects across the City.\n- Strengthening the riverside walls along Foss Bank, as part of a £6 million Conservative Government investment in the City’s flood defences.\n- £3.4 million to support Lincoln Science and Innovation Park (Phase 2).\n- £1 million in Conservative Government cash to revamp the High Street end of Cornhill.\n- £87,000 from the Conservative Government’s Welcome Back Fund to help local high streets reopen and attract shoppers and tourists.\n- £1.3 million for the Centre for Innovation in Rural Health.\nKarl campaigns to ensure that Lincoln remains a business-friendly City and leverages its position as a UK-leading science, innovation and engineering centre. This includes world-leading companies such as Siemens, Bifrangi and Inzpire.\nHe has supported crucial business developments such as the creation of the Lincoln Science and Innovation Park to create a world-class environment for science, research and innovation in the City. This had an extra £3.4 million of Government support being earmarked. for Phase Two of its development which is due to be completed in early 2022.\nKarl always advocates local employment programmes to help people into work and also Apprenticeships and other related skills schemes. He has run many successful job fairs and recently opened the 2021 Greater Lincolnshire LEP online Jobs Fair too.\nEven before Karl was first elected as the Member of Parliament for Lincoln, he was at the forefront of the successful campaign to keep the Bailgate Post Office open.\nENVIRONMENT\n----------------------\nKarl has lobbied the Conservative Government for more investment in the City’s flood defences and with £6 million in funding for the Lincoln Flood Defences Project, this will maintain the existing standard of flood-risk protection for around 4,000 homes and businesses in Lincoln.\nHe raised concerns about the environmental (including flooding), increased traffic congestion and infrastructure impact (especially schools and health service) of the Labour City Council’s Western Growth Corridor (Swanpool) scheme, which includes over 3,000 houses.\nHe will continue to hold the City Council to account on this issue, whilst ensuring that it lobbies the Government to ensure it provides infrastructure funding (as he has successfully done with respect to the £20 million road bridge between Skellingthorpe Road and Tritton Road).\nROYAL AIR FORCE\n---------------------------\nKarl always supports the Royal Air Force and the Armed Forces more widely – especially RAF Waddington which is in his constituency.\nSupported the £94 million investment into RAF Waddington from 2021 by the Conservative Government. This is because it has been chosen as the home of the Protector International Training Centre.\nAlongside Sir Edward Leigh MP, he campaigned to ensure that the Red Arrows base remains in Lincolnshire, with the world-famous air display team transferring to RAF Waddington in 2022.\nRAF SCAMPTON\n---------------------------\nKarl opposes the use of RAF Scampton (in Sir Edward Leigh MP’s constituency but three miles away from Lincoln) as a base to house up to 2,000 adult male immigrants (most, if not all, will have arrived here illegally).\nHe has raised significant concerns about the impact on policing, business, the community and the health service. He is particularly concerned about any increase in crime and that the lessons from the outrage at RAF Bassingbourn in 2014 are not repeated. This included three of the Libyan cadets sexually assaulting a woman in Cambridge and two more raping a man. He has constantly raised these concerns directly with the Government including at Prime Ministers’ Questions.",
  "https_www_karlmccartney_co_uk_/https_www_karlmccartney_co_uk_news_conservatives-putting-lincoln-and-country-first/content_15.html": "This month has seen the Government announce a huge range of measures putting our wonderful City and Country First. I have also been busy making sure the voices of people in Lincoln, Skellingthorpe, Bracebridge Heath and Waddington East have been heard loud and clear.\nHere is just a selection of measures and issues.\nState Pension\nAt the start of April, the Conservative Government increased the State Pension by 8.5%, meaning pensioners in Lincoln will be £900 better off.\nThis comes on top of last year’s 10.1% increase and our commitment to the Triple Lock.\nOnly the Conservatives are on the side of pensioners.\nLincoln Christmas Market\nLabour councillors on the City of Lincoln Council continue to refuse to bring back the Christmas Market they so cruelly closed last year – against the wishes of the public and businesses in the City. Here I raise the matter again in Parliament: https://www.facebook.com/share/v/WULGAFoddnbBGuvz\nRwanda Bill\nWe passed the new law to allow us to deliver a deterrent that will break the business model of the criminal gangs and save lives. This country and this government should decide who comes to the UK, not criminal gangs. It will start the flights and the stop the boats.\nWe also need to scrap the plans for RAF Scampton to be used to house people who have arrived here illegally.\nDefence Investment\nGiven our RAF Waddington is at the heart of defending our Country, I was especially pleased to see the Prime Minister announce this week that the UK will increase defence spending to 2.5% of our annual income by 2030 - an increase of £75 billion.\nThis is the biggest increase for a generation and shows how we Conservatives are fully committed to the first duty of any government - the security of the British people.\nGiven the war in Ukraine and other conflicts around the world including the threat of cyber warfare, we have to strengthen our national security at home and abroad. It has to be a priority for our Country as the world becomes more dangerous and unstable.\nIt also comes as no surprise to anyone that Labour refuse to commit to this, causing more uncertainty for our defence industry and putting our national security at risk.\nProtecting Shopkeepers\nThe Conservative Government are making assaulting a shop worker a standalone criminal offence. With tougher sentences too.\nIt is completely unacceptable that shoplifters and those abusing shopworkers think their treatment of those who provide such a great service is acceptable.\nI will certainly be supporting this in Parliament - protecting our Lincoln shopworkers and those across the Country.\nWestern Growth Corridor/Swanpool\nI was pleased to recently meet with Cllr. Tom Dyer, Leader of the City of Lincoln Council Conservative Group, at the site of the planned Western Growth Corridor traffic bridge.\nThe bridge will connect Tritton Road with the Western Growth Corridor development. £20m worth of funding was awarded from Government to ensure this vital infrastructure project could move forward.\nYou can watch the video here: https://www.facebook.com/KarlMcCartneyLincoln/videos/1906255233127055",

This is in support of requests from the local universities.\nHis letter states that he has “been made aware that some students and residents are afraid to walk home in the dark. I realise the return to a more 24-hour economy' of the City of Lincoln after the hiatus of the pandemic lockdowns will have prompted this request maybe. It seems this ’safety aspect’ of life in a City is being revisited and so streetlights are the Student Unions’ latest big issue for the areas of travel as students make their way home who live both on and off campus. I am told that the issue is replicated by Bishop Grossteste’s university too, following a meeting earlier this week with local police officers at South Park.\n“Keeping women and girls (alongside men and boys) safe at night is a key Government priority – not only as tackling violence against women and girls was added to the revised Strategic Policing Requirement as a national priority but it is also aligned to the Safer Streets initiative. This request therefore should be seen as part of delivering on these overarching commitments.”\nConcerning the request, Karl said: “Keeping everybody safe in our City Centre is vitally important but it is crucial that they also feel safe. Having street lights turned off in our City Centre will certainly not do that. That is why the County Council needs to change its stance and also why Lincolnshire Police needs to be demanding they do so. I fully support the local student unions in their requests for change.”",

These will support workers, families, pensioners and businesses right across Lincoln, Skellingthorpe, Bracebridge Heath and Waddington East. All have been greatly welcomed by Lincoln MP, Karl.\nLincoln’s workers can find out how much the cut in national insurance benefits them via this online tax calculator: https://taxcuts.conservatives.com\nThese measures include:\n- CUTTING NATIONAL INSURANCE FOR LINCOLN’S WORKERS BY 2p: Cutting national insurance for Lincoln’s workers is a huge boost and applies to those who are self-employed too. It is vital taxes on working are as low as possible so people can spend more of what they have earned. This is brilliant news.\n- A Lincoln shop worker on £21,058 will be better off by £340.\n- A self-employed Lincoln plumber on £34,361 will be better off by £846.\n- BOOSTING THE NATIONAL LIVING WAGE TO RECORD LEVELS: From 1st April, the national living wage will increase to £11.44 an hour - a 9.8% per cent increase which will benefit so many of Lincoln’s workers.\n- SUPPORTING LINCOLN’S PENSIONERS: The Conservatives are boosting pensions, in line with our Triple Lock, by 8.5%, ensuring dignity in older age for those who have worked their entire lives. We will uprate the basic state pension, the new state pension and pension credit standard minimum guarantee by 8.5% in April 2024.\n- FREEZING FUEL DUTY FOR LINCOLN’S DRIVERS: For the 14th year in a row, the Conservatives are freezing the duty rates drivers have to pay at the pump. The last Labour Government cruelly introduced a scheme that continually raised fuel duty after they had run out of money once again. They needed to try and fleece those who had the nerve to want to own a car or van – hitting local Lincoln drivers and businesses. The Conservatives have never supported this.\n- REDUCING INFLATION TO SUPPORT LINCOLN’S FAMILIES AND PENSIONERS: High inflation is hugely damaging and hugely affects everyone’s costs of living. We have reduced it from 11% to 4% and independent forecasters say it will be just 2% by the summer. A Conservative Government delivering what it said it would.\n- FREEZING ALCOHOL DUTY TO SUPPORT OUR LOCAL PUBS ACROSS THE CITY: Our local pubs play such a vital role in our community bringing people together and employing so many people.#\n- MORE SUPPORT FOR LINCOLN’S NHS: The Government announced welcome plans to boost the numbers of people it supports by freeing up clinicians’ time to focus on patients and cut wait times – especially at Lincoln County Hospital.\n- MORE SUPPORT FOR LINCOLN’S SMALL BUSINESSES: The Government is increasing the VAT registration threshold for small businesses for the first time since 2017, raising it from £85,000 to £90,000. This will be a real benefit to many of Lincoln’s small businesses.\n- SAVING FOR BRITAIN: The Government is launching a new UK Individual Savings Account (ISA), with a £5,000 allowance, to promote investment in UK assets and funds. It creates a tax-free investment opportunity for savers to invest specifically in UK assets.\nLincoln’s MP, Karl, who always Puts Lincoln First, said: “Today's Budget has shown once again that only the Conservatives are on the side of Lincoln’s workers, families, pensioners and businesses. We are cutting taxes for workers, driving down the cost of living and supporting firms.\n“We are able to do this because we are successfully managing the economy with falling inflation, a forecast growth in the economy and cutting taxes.\n“Starmer and his Lincoln Labour cheerleaders would wreck the economy and local jobs in Lincoln. Their actions in closing Lincoln’s Christmas Market which has damaged local businesses, jobs and charities, shows they have no clue. They would put up taxes like they always do, lose control of inflation that eats into everyone’s income and fails businesses, large and small. That is ‘Situation Normal’ for Labour.”",

For those of you who don’t know me, my name is Karl McCartney and I am the Member of Parliament for Lincoln. It is my great pleasure to welcome you tonight as we mark Her Majesty The Queen’s Platinum Jubilee with the lighting of the Jubilee Beacons.\nIn a few short moments, Lincoln will join towns and cities across the UK and the Commonwealth in lighting beacons to mark this momentous occasion. In total, more than three thousand beacons will be lit at the same time around the world. You can see our beacons on the castle wall behind me, and tonight they will be lit by the Lord Lieutenant of Lincolnshire, Mr. Toby Dennis, and the Right Worshipful, the Mayor of Lincoln, Councillor Mrs. Rosanne Kirk.\nThere is a long tradition of celebrating Royal Jubilees, Weddings and Coronations with the lighting of beacons. In 1897, beacons were lit to celebrate Queen Victoria’s Diamond Jubilee. And 10 years ago, Lincoln Castle was host to beacons to mark Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II’s Diamond Jubilee.\nBefore we light the beacons tonight, we will have some more music. We will first hear a piper playing a piece called Diu Regnare – which is Latin and translates too: ‘Long to Reign’, and a bugler playing a piece called ‘Majesty’, both from the Castle Walls behind me, before the Lincoln Amateur Operatic & Dramatic Society Choir sings ‘A Life Lived With Grace’, the winner of the ‘Song for the Commonwealth’ competition, written especially for this unique occasion.\nThank you to you all for joining us tonight and I hope you enjoy this 70th Platinum Jubilee celebration here in Lincoln.\n=================\nClosing message\nThank you once again for joining us tonight here at Lincoln Castle. And thanks too, to Lincolnshire County Council, the City of Lincoln Council, and all others involved in organising and performing at this event this evening.\nThroughout this weekend, there will be more live entertainment from the bandstand here. And throughout the weekend, coverage of many other Jubilee events around our Country will be shown on the screen at Lincoln Castle for all to enjoy, including on Saturday night coverage of the Platinum Party at the Palace in London and all are invited to continue the celebrations.\nSo you are welcome to bring a picnic and come and enjoy and extend the atmosphere of this unique moment in our Country’s history, if not this unique moment across the world.\nNow before we finish with a traditional round of applause for everyone involved and for you all to each other for turning up, I think as one of the oldest cities in her Majesty’s Kingdom, in the oldest Parliamentary Constituency in her Majesty’s kingdom, we yellow bellies can show our appreciation of our Sovereign’s long, kind-hearted and goodness filled reign.\nBy showing how proud we are to be the best of British - and singing is a joyous group pursuit – and the music we have heard this evening has been wonderful, but I think we would all like to take part in something together, so a song you all know, maybe even a hymn, but I think a lasting memory for all of us would be to sing one verse of the national anthem – with all our might and as if there was a roof on Lincoln Castle and we are trying to raise it up with our voices.\nEnjoy the rest of your Jubilee weekend, thankyou Lincoln and Lincolnshire, and goodnight.",

I welcome our Prime Minister’s decisive action to overturn convictions and quickly deliver compensation.\n“But we must seek prosecution and redress against those at Post Office @RoyalMail Fujitsu in the UK & Ireland, and civil servants - who knew the prosecutions were unsafe and purposely covered up the problems.\n“Ministers of all colours (remember, Horizon was introduced by the Labour Government in 1999 and who oversaw many of the prosecutions) need to be held to account, not least LibDem Leader Ed Davey, but importantly so do the civil servants who advised them there was nothing wrong and there was ‘nothing to see here.’\n“Hansard is clear on those Backbenchers in the House of Commons who have consistently and unyieldingly kept up the pressure on successive Governments, despite reassurances and platitudes from those at fault.

  "https_www_karlmccartney_co_uk_/https_www_karlmccartney_co_uk_news_delivering-brexit-2017/content_16.html": "Published on The Lincolnite Web Site\nThe last four weeks have been busy in both Westminster and Lincoln as is often the case as each year comes to an end.\nOne pleasing aspect is the fact that despite what all the doom-mongers predicted about the future of the UK economy if we voted to Leave the European Union, the economy is happily still growing. So much so in fact that the Chancellor, in his recent Autumn Statement, raised the limit to £11,500 before people have to start paying tax and he also froze vehicle fuel duty.\nIn my mind, the key obstacle to a successful Brexit is from the “enemy within”. These are the legions of Labour and SNP MPs, media commentators and vested trade union and business interests who on the one hand say they accept the result, yet are doing all they can to derail it. They keep talking our Country down, spreading fake news and putting Parliamentary and legal obstacles in the way of an orderly departure from the EU. It is as if they want this Country, and our economic well being, to fail. I see this every week from the SNP Members who I sit with on the Brexit Select Committee. Rather than taking the job of both scrutinising and supporting the Government seriously, they act like they are in a student’s union debate.\nSuch Machiavellian behaviour is immature, anti-democratic and un-British. It is also out of kilter with the millions of people, including those in the City of Lincoln, who voted Remain in the Referendum. While the vote did not go their way, they, and the vast majority of our Nation have accepted the result in a grown up way. They, like the rest of us, now want the Government to be allowed unhindered to strike the best deal with the European Union and of course with the rest of the world. I wish those who deliberately want Brexit and our Country to fail would take a leaf out of their book by behaving in a sensible, British and mature manner, their tantrums have lasted long enough.\nWe know, not unexpectedly, that the European Commission (and Council) (not our fellow European countries though) is being deliberately unhelpful. This is especially the case on reciprocal rights for UK Citizens living and working in the EU, and EU citizens living and working here. Perhaps the Commission should remember that they are not democratically elected and their behaviour was one of the reasons people in Lincoln, Lincolnshire and the whole of the UK voted Leave.\nAt a local level, I am gravely concerned about the decision by the Lincolnshire West Clinical Commissioning Group (LWCCG) to close two of the City of Lincoln’s GP surgeries in January next year. This means 5,500 patients have had to register elsewhere in our City.\nMy concern is not just for those patients who have to find a new GP surgery but with the knock-on effect this will have on the whole City. Unless the LWCCG can find extra capacity in the City to replace the surgeries they are closing then there is a clear risk that GP waiting times will increase for all. They have stated that they will provide extra financial support to enable other GP practices to take on additional staff. However, that is not good enough without a clear commitment that there will not be an increase in average waiting times. It seems to me that the LWCCG are forgetting that local people pay their taxes and expect better public services, not worsening services. This is even more so when the Conservative Government continues to spend more on the NHS each year. Please rest assured, I will be continuing to hold the LWCCG to account over the coming months.\nOn a more personal and non-political note, I wish everyone in Lincoln and across the whole County a Merry Christmas and best wishes for the New Year.",
  "https_www_karlmccartney_co_uk_/https_www_karlmccartney_co_uk_news_personal-injury-fraud/content_69.html": "I declare an interest as both a justice of the peace and one of the 30 million-plus drivers in our country. I am also a freeman of the City of London, and since securing this debate I have been contacted by various claims management companies, solicitors and insurers, big and small, who have offered information and briefings to assist my contribution. I explicitly thank the Industry and Parliament Trust and Liverpool Victoria, or LV=; I spent Monday with various of their personnel who deal daily with fraudulent personal injury claims, claimants and the companies that are farming information—or vishing, as I learned—to generate moneys for themselves. Ultimately, anyone with an insurance policy is paying for this immoral action through rising insurance premium costs.\nBefore I had the luck, honour and privilege to become a Member of Parliament in 2010, I was the victim of a car insurance scam, having previously suffered twice after uninsured drivers caused accidents involving my family’s vehicles. In 2009, at a roundabout near Cheshire Oaks, a car purposely stopped in front of me for no reason. The ensuing collision slightly damaged my bumper—well, in fact it was the front bumper of my father’s three-week-old 700 series BMW. Despite the low speed and very minimal damage to just his bumper, a claim was made with my insurers for some £16,500.\nThe court threw out the claim—after a protracted, three-year-long case—as, among other things, the car owner claimed £1,000 for a vehicle recovery charge from a company owned by his cousin in St Albans, when actually he drove the vehicle away. The two circa 21-year-olds in the vehicle were, he claimed, actually his father, who used the vehicle in his work as a driving instructor. As the case progressed, it turned out that the driver of the vehicle with which I collided was not the driver who attended court.\nAfter the hearing, it was revealed that the same scammers had attempted, with success, similar claims on six previous occasions in just a few years, with the vehicle registered at the same address. My experience was a classic example of an induced motor accident—a “crash for cash” scam—but what happened to the fraudsters? The judge was very good in his summing up, but admitted that even though he wanted the police to investigate the perpetrators, there was little likelihood that that would occur. Taxpayers, who fund the court system, find that they pay not only higher insurance premiums, but in a secondary way, through the valuable court time taken up with disputing and proving that fraudulent claims are being made.\nDuring my time with Liverpool Victoria on Monday I was shown various examples of fraudulent personal injury claims in which judges really did not get it. Refreshingly, though, there is some evidence that rare individual judges are taking positive steps to halt the onward and upward march of fraudulent claims, which cost the Government and the population of our country considerable sum each year—and all power to them. I trust that my right hon. and learned Friend Jeremy Wright, my hon. and learned Friend Robert Buckland, and my right hon. Friends the Members for Derbyshire Dales (Mr McLoughlin), for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove) and for Tatton (Mr Osborne), along with their ministerial colleagues, will take note if passed details of this debate.\nThe list of most eminent places and their elected representatives that I have just elucidated helps to crystallise part of the problem we have in dealing with this issue: it cuts across a number of Government Departments. But that should not be a problem, now that it has been clearly identified; we just need someone, and their civil servants, to want to proactively take control and deal with it. I am sure that the good Minister, who represents Gosport, will have noted my plea, along with our other colleagues, and will pass it on to open ears in the corridors of power.\nAccording to the insurance company Aviva, as well as Enterprise Rent-A-Car, City of London Police, Keoghs, Liverpool Victoria and many others who have contacted me and operate in the transport, insurance and judiciary sectors, a minor personal injury—mainly whiplash—claim adds at least £93 to the average annual motor premium. It is a £2.5 billion per annum problem, and around half of the costs relate to very minor injuries which require little or no proof of injury.\nIt would seem that we in this country have the weakest necks in the world—certainly in the parts of the country that are hotspots for such claims. Funnily enough, as a geographer, the correlation seems to be phonetic: most of the places begin with B—but I digress. It is such a serious issue that Volvo engineers from Sweden are most interested in our seeming propensity for whiplash injuries, especially as for some years their cars have been designed and engineered to minimise such neck complaints in minor and low-speed bumps and scrapes. Later in my speech I will return to how we compare to other nations in our likelihood to suffer from so-called whiplash injuries.\nThe culture of personal injury fraud is often fuelled and overseen by organised crime, and there are many examples of opportunistic claims that put innocent motorists’ safety at risk and inflate their premiums. Many fraudulent claims stem from nuisance calls made by some, but definitely not all, claims management companies, and—perhaps more worrying—by so-called marketing companies acting directly at the behest of some infamous and certainly not morally superior solicitors and law firms.\nThe so-called marketing companies are directly providing leads to claimant solicitors, underlining the fact that there is still too much cash in the system, despite the changes made in the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012, known colloquially as LASPO. How are these solicitors and law firms and their partners in crime, the marketing companies, securing the supposedly outlawed trade in personal data—our email addresses, home and mobile phone numbers through which we receive unwarranted and unwanted emails, calls and texts exhorting us to make claims, as there is “£3,000 to £4,000” just waiting for each person who makes a personal injury claim? That is the nub of the problem.\nWe need to stamp out the cold calling, and quickly. I have suffered, as have many of my constituents and those of other colleagues present, and, indeed, those of colleagues who could not attend, such as Paul Flynn, who offered his support but is engaged elsewhere in the House. I believe that my hon. Friend Chris Philp will speak about cold calling and its relationship to the myriad fraudulent claims in the country as a whole later in the debate.\nPersonal injury insurance fraud can be summed up as manifesting itself in a number of ways, and some aspects are easier to detect than others.\nThe three most common strands of third-party fraud are: accidents fabricated or deliberately staged purely with a view to submitting false claims for compensation; fabricated personal injury claims where a genuine accident has occurred; and genuine accidents and injuries, but with aspects of the claim being fabricated or exaggerated.\nFraudulent injury claims cause increasing costs in car insurance for consumers and businesses. The UK now sees more compensation claims for whiplash per car accident than any other western European country. As I have already said, we are known as having weakest necks in Europe. Efforts by the Government have had limited effect, and personal injury claims are now at a record high. In the first quarter of 2015, the number of personal injury claims made through the Ministry of Justice claims portal was the highest on record, with 13% more than in the same period for 2011-12, before LASPO was introduced. Claims data for 2015 so far show that, for some companies, 80% of all personal injury claims received were related to whiplash.\nLiverpool Victoria estimates that, in 2015, at least 11% of the average car insurance premiums it provides can be attributed to paying for whiplash claims. That is a significant and unnecessary cost for consumers—our constituents. At Liverpool Victoria, 10% of claims handlers are employed purely to tackle fraudulent claims, at an annual cost to the business of £4.5 million to run the team. Those costs are ultimately paid for by customers, further increasing the cost of car insurance for individuals. Businesses are also affected by rising commercial insurance premiums for company vehicles. For small businesses in particular it is an unwelcome and unnecessary cost.\nThe Information Commissioner’s Office received 180,000 complaints about nuisance calls or texts in 2014-15—a 12% increase on the previous year. According to research that Liverpool Victoria commissioned in July 2015, each British person—importantly and unfortunately, this includes children—receives an average of 468 nuisance calls and text messages every year. We waste six and a half hours a year dodging calls, deleting texts and listening to phone messages that none of us wanted to receive. One in three reported receiving more nuisance calls and texts than calls from friends and family, and more than 80% of those who receive personal injury calls have never even been involved in an accident for which they could, if they wanted, have made a claim.\nFraudulent claims also have a cost for our GPs and the NHS as a whole. This is an area of great concern, as fraudulent claims are putting additional pressure on an already-strained NHS. Liverpool Victoria research carried out with GPs shows that GPs now see 116,000 people every month that they suspect are inventing or exaggerating an injury to claim compensation, which equates to nearly 1 million wasted GP hours every year. At this point, I will depart from my written speech and say that I may include the Secretary of State for Health in the list of eminent persons I read out earlier, because this is a serious issue for the NHS.\nClaims farming generated by rogue solicitor firms and claims management companies is creating high volumes of fraudulent and exaggerated personal injury claims. Aged claims farming is the new norm, and it has increased since LASPO was introduced. Insurance firms have seen a significant increase in claims farming—the practice by which a claimant solicitor or a claims management company targets individuals with nuisance calls and texts to encourage them to make a personal injury claim. It now represents between 20% and 28% of all claims received by some companies each month. In January 2013, before the introduction of LASPO, the figure was 13% or below.\nA high volume of farmed personal injury claims are being generated by just a few rogue solicitor firms. Despite evidence being passed to the Solicitors Regulation Authority, this behaviour has not been challenged, but it should be. Although the practice of claims farming is widespread, a minority of law firms are driving the problem: Liverpool Victoria’s analysis shows that more than 41% of suspected farmed claims that it received in 2015 were submitted by just 10 law firms.\nLet me turn to the issue of cold calling and vishing. There is clear evidence, as my hon. Friend Karen Lumley said, that claims management companies and solicitor firms that cold call and text people are targeting vulnerable individuals. Claims management companies target individuals by calling directly from purchased marketing lists. The practice is widespread. Research conducted by Liverpool Victoria in June 2015 shows that the UK public collectively receive more than 60 million nuisance calls and texts every day—equivalent to 43,000 a minute. A significant proportion of the approaches are from lawyers or claims management companies trying to encourage individuals to make a personal injury claim.\nWorryingly, the number of claims being made without the knowledge or consent of the claimant is increasing. A range of unlawful tactics are used to obtain and verify the data. In such cases, claims management companies act without formal instruction and the claimant does not sign any documents. Some claims management firms have even forged claimants’ signatures. The practice of vishing insurance companies is rife. As I heard on Monday, the number of vishing calls that London Victoria’s staff receive is rising: in just this year to October, it received more than 3,000 vishing calls.\nI believe that the Government need to address the root cause of motor insurance fraud and customer harassment: the excessive cash in the system that creates unwarranted incentives. To deal with the problem, the Government should, first, introduce a minimum threshold for simple whiplash claims and replace cash compensation with rehabilitation, which would deal a fatal blow to those making nuisance calls and the “cash for crash” industry.\nSecondly, the Government should ensure that magistrates, district judges and Crown court judges are aware of the cost of fraudulent claims to the nation and the need to take affirmative action, including dealing with uninsured drivers with parity. Why would somebody get insurance if they need to be caught and fined four times in a year to equal the cost of insuring their vehicle?\nThirdly, the Government should remove the civil court aspect of chasing a fraudulent claimant. We need to stamp out this pernicious crime. Only by instructing the Crown Prosecution Service to go after fraudulent claimants actively, backed up by the police, will we do so.\nThe real kicker of those three simple undertakings is that the vast majority of the voting public—certainly, 100% of law-abiding, insurance premium-paying drivers—would be utterly joyous and would commend us for doing some good in this place and making their lives easier and, ultimately, cheaper.\nThe challenge is that, as the Association of British Insurers’ premium tracker shows, the average motor premium for the second quarter of 2015 is £367, and it is increasing. Similarly, the number of whiplash claims is showing worrying signs of rising again. The Ministry of Justice’s claims portal shows that it has increased by 6% in the past nine months. There remains excessive cash in the system, which continues to fuel exaggerated and fraudulent personal injury claims, putting upward pressure on motor premiums. Organised and opportunistic crimes such as “cash for crash” continue to put motorists’ personal safety at risk while inflating all of our insurance premiums. Nuisance calls encourage fraudulent behaviour, leave law-abiding drivers vulnerable and mean that the staff of our insurance companies are encouraged—hounded, even—to breach data rules. Bogus data management companies and similar organisations, such as some data marketing companies and claimant solicitors, continue to plague motorists with texts and calls. They need to be regulated as a whole while the compensation culture and the opportunities remain.\nAccording to the ABI, almost 130,000 cases of claims fraud were detected in 2014, totalling more than £1.3 billion—a 4% increase in value compared with 2013. In addition, there were 212,000 cases of application fraud. Between 2009 and 2014, the overall value of fraud detected rose by 57%. The insurance industry detects fraud in less than 2% of claims, but one in nine whiplash claims are fraudulent. The average cost of a bodily injury claim is £10,680, and the overall average for all claims is £2,649. Bodily injury claims make up 9% of the total number of claims, yet represent 51% of the total value of claims.\nMany insurers have made it clear to me that they are taking action. Between 2005 and 2013, the number of UK motor accidents fell by 30%, but the number of whiplash claims increased by 62%, a large number of which are believed by the insurance industry to be fraudulent or grossly exaggerated. During that time, the average cost of a bodily injury claim increased by 73%. Indeed, one of Enterprise Rent-A-Car’s largest ongoing costs is the impact of personal injury claims as a result of accidents involving its vehicles. It is its third highest expense after fleet acquisition and personnel costs. Its fleet liability costs have been significantly impacted in recent years by the huge increase in personal injury claims. The growth is driven by low-value claims for soft tissue injuries.\nWe have a compensation culture problem that has not been dealt with and is not shared by many other European countries. According to Frontier Economics’ whiplash report, whiplash claims in France comprise only 3% of personal injury claims, in comparison with 94% in the UK. In Germany, the number of bodily injury claims has dropped in line with the fall in road traffic accidents. In Norway, most minor injury claims are handled without the involvement of a solicitor. In Sweden, a de minimis threshold means that symptoms must appear and be assessed within three to four days of the accident.\nWhat can we learn from those examples? Whiplash claims are not as significant in other European countries, due to the much more stringent conditions that must be met before a victim can successfully claim compensation for a whiplash injury. In April 2013, 70% of personal injury claims following road accidents in the UK were for whiplash, compared with 30% in France and Denmark, 31% in Spain, 35% in the Netherlands and 68% in Italy.\nCertain European countries have implemented a variety of measures to reduce the frequency of claims. In France, the diagnosis of a whiplash claim requires objective proof, based on more rigorous medical testing. Claimants are made to pay for an initial report on the injury. France also requires medical practitioners diagnosing whiplash to be specially trained in bodily injury diagnosis. Its small claims limit, which is greater than the UK’s, allows more claims to be settled without solicitors. I am also sure that it would not allow medical examinations to take place in Pakistan via Skype.\nIn Germany, a severity scale is used to assess the extent of the disability caused to a claimant by their injury, and compensation is awarded accordingly. Emphasis is placed on having a high level of proof of the injury when a claim is made following a low-speed collision, and injuries are diagnosed using clear objective criteria. Finally, contingency fees are permitted only in cases where the claimant cannot afford to hire a lawyer, meaning that lawyers are less incentivised to pursue cases.\nIn Sweden, claims for whiplash injuries can be made only if symptoms appear and are assessed within three to four days of the road traffic accident. There is a table of predictable damages, as used in the UK for workplace personal injuries and in Norway, meaning that claims are limited to the type of injury caused, increasing the efficiency and transparency of the handling of claims. Spain also uses a table of predictable damages, and it requires medical practitioners diagnosing whiplash claims to have specific qualifications, like in France.\nSome companies and organisations believe that establishing an objective test for whiplash is imperative in reaching the core of the current problems surrounding insurance fraud. That would filter exaggerated and fraudulent claims out of the claims process, ensuring a reduction in the number of whiplash claims. At the same time, it would ensure that those who have genuine claims were not prevented from making them.\nI want to go a bit further than Europe and refer to a taskforce report from Quebec, which is in Canada for those whose geography might be a bit rusty. It was produced in 2001 and provided an objective basis for diagnosing whiplash. It is a little bit old, but it has since been endorsed by several other Canadian provinces. The task force divided whiplash-associated disorders into five grades. At grade 0, no neck pain, stiffness or any physical signs are noticed. Grade 1 involves complaints of neck pain, stiffness or tenderness only, but no physical signs are noted by the examining physician. Grade 2 disorders indicate neck complaints, and the examining physician will find a decreased range of motion and point tenderness in the neck. Grade 3 encompasses neck complaints, plus neurological signs such as decreased deep tendon reflexes, weakness and sensory deficits. At grade 4, people may suffer neck complaints and fracture or dislocation, or injury to the spinal cord. As I said, severity scales are also used in Germany, where the number of bodily injury claims has dropped in line with the fall in road accidents.\nI recognise that the Government of which I am a part have taken and are taking steps to address such matters. I welcome, for example, their insurance fraud taskforce, set up by my right hon. Friend Chris Grayling in his former role, and I look forward to it reporting next month. I also welcome the fact that Her Majesty’s Treasury and the Ministry of Justice have commissioned a fundamental review of the regulation of claims management companies following concerns that CMCs fuel speculative unmeritorious claims for compensation and create a significant social nuisance through unsolicited calls and texts, misleading marketing and high charges.\nHowever—I will state this clearly for the record—CMCs are only the tip of this fraudulent iceberg. The dodgy solicitors and law firms, some from the other side of the world, need to be investigated and shamed too. The consultation on the taskforce’s review closed last Friday, and I hope that its report will focus on customer outcomes, with fewer nuisance calls, and on having a new, more stringent and encompassing regulator, like the Financial Conduct Authority, to ensure consistency across the entire financial world and its markets.\nI commend the City of London police’s model. The insurance fraud enforcement department was established in January 2012, when insurance fraud was reported to be costing £2 billion and the coalition Government were reducing police force budgets. It is a specialist police unit operated by City of London police and funded by the Association of British Insurers. Since its establishment, IFED has been responsible for more than 1,300 arrests and interviews under police caution, 172 convictions, 256 police cautions and 150 people being on bail to court or police, and 325 investigations are in progress, with new cases coming in every week. An example of IFED’s work was the bringing to justice of a Keighley pair, who were jailed for creating an insurance web of deception worth thousands of pounds. I will briefly summarise their deception. Those two fraudsters created insurance policies for people who did not exist and then submitted 300 false personal injury referrals worth £167,000 for made-up road accidents. Both have been jailed for four and half years.\nHowever, loopholes remain in the current personal injury referral fee ban and inducement laws. The regulation should include the data marketing companies, claimant solicitors and law firms, which are well known and easily identifiable, that are under the radar of the current regulator. We should outlaw insurance payments for whiplash injuries before proper medical examinations have taken place and concrete proof is provided. The key issue in the personal injury market is the level of financial incentives that still exist, despite the referral fee ban and the reduction in legal costs. It is still far too easy to make a claim for whiplash, and the rewards for doing so in terms of damages and legal costs have created and maintained the adverse behaviours that have prevailed since 1999 when no win, no fee was introduced in the UK. The small claims track for personal injury claims has been left unchanged for 16 years despite all other track limits increasing.\nThere is simply too much cash in the personal injury system, which is borne out by the continuing menace of the nuisance calls that we and our constituents receive and the fraudulent activity of some CMCs, so-called data marketing companies and some solicitor and law firms. Recent increases, which are way above current inflation rates, in the Judicial College’s suggested awards for minor injuries will just make matters worse. We need a more stringent and proportionate legal and regulatory regime that addresses the financial incentives in personal injury, cuts out the nuisance calls and ensures that all benefiting parties are regulated.\nAlthough I am grateful to the Government for the steps they have taken to date, and to the Minister for taking the time to be here today to respond to this important debate, further reform is needed to keep insurance premiums for law-abiding motorists down. In addition to introducing a minimum threshold for simple whiplash claims and replacing cash compensation with rehabilitation, I would like to see, as a minimum, a ban on nuisance calls and better regulation of those who farm data, such as some solicitors, law firms, CMCs and marketing companies; the removal of all referral fees from the claims process; a limit of £5,000 on personal injury claims; a reduction in the limitation period for bringing minor whiplash claims from three years to 12 months after the accident; and the introduction of a table of predictive damages linked to a percentage of severity or disability to cut down unnecessary legal arguments. I note that France, Spain and Norway have fixed damages tariffs for whiplash-type injuries.\nOnce again, I thank the Minister and other colleagues for attending the debate, and I urge her to do everything that she can to deal with and limit fraudulent personal injury claims and to support the law-abiding motorists of Lincoln and the 30 million-plus drivers across the country. I believe that I have managed to outline a fair few potential processes that could be undertaken to reduce this blot on our road transport landscape. I hope the Minister and our friends in Government and the good offices of Whitehall will feel the same to a great degree.",

All of which couldn’t carry out their important work without the diligent efforts of trustees, most of whom are volunteers.\nTrustees Week which runs until 13 November highlights the important work that charity trustees do all year round and raises awareness of how people can gain valuable experience and skills through volunteering as a charity trustee.\nKarl McCartney, MP for Lincoln, said: “The charities in Lincoln wouldn’t be able to make a difference without the important contribution of the charity trustees. With so many great local charities doing important work, I want to mark the start of national Trustees’ Week by thanking the 1,741 local charity trustees for their tireless dedication to the civic life of Lincoln. It is why I hold an annual thankyou event to charities across Lincoln every year”\n“I would like to encourage anyone thinking of becoming a trustee to use Trustees’ Week to find out more about the role and the various ways they can get involved. Trusteeship brings excellent opportunities including meeting new people, developing new skills, and applying existing expertise to new, real-life challenges.”\nWilliam Shawcross, Chairman of the Charity Commission, said: “We know the work of trustees is crucial to the success of their charities, and they often bear a considerable load. However, this Trustees Week we want to encourage trustees to keep doing excellent work - and remind them that despite the recent increase in focus, the legal burden hasn't changed.\nWe see great stewardship in our engagement with charities, often by trustees facing difficult and complex situations. Some of the best decision-making we have seen has been a product of having diversity on boards, meaning trustees can challenge each other and offer conflicting perspectives to ultimately achieve the best outcome for their charity.”\nTrustees’ Week runs until 13 November 2016.

So all of us here today can clearly claim to be the successors of the first railway pioneers and that we represent the global home of the modern railway.\nFast forward to 2016 and a modern East Coast Rail artery is as vitally important now as it was in 1825. In a post Brexit Britain we can only make the most of the opportunities leaving the European Union will bring and protecting what we already have if we see serious investment in the transport network and especially the railways – not only in building capacity but also in making them cheaper, more resilient and reliable. We cannot afford to ignore the circa £9 billion, that investment of around £3billion in the rail infrastructure, will bring.\nThe focus, and this is in my personal opinion as a Lincolnshire and East Midlands Member of Parliament, tilted a little too far towards the North West… as if only better London links between Birmingham, Liverpool Chester and Manchester matter. Whilst we have seen some rebalancing with the investment in the Trans Penine region including a renewed impetus on HS3 - to form the perfect rail triangle, we also do need extra investment in the East Coast Mainline. This will ensure that the cities and towns that we all represent are treated as equals and are fully plugged into a modernised rail network, that rightly links us all quickly and regularly to our capital City.\nThere is something very British about the railway system, it forms part of the history and soul of our nation, because of the enabling ability railways give us to:\n- allow businesses to trade\n- to bring families together\n- to leave home for the first time and move around the Country to study, and\n- to literally being able to buy a ticket, hop on a train and visit new places the length and breadth of our great country on a whim if we so wish.\nBeing able to travel from London to Inverness or Aberdeen, looking out of the window to see what a great and varied Country we live in is a must for anyone and should in fact be on the national curriculum. School trips to museums are important of course, but train journeys for young people around the Country will open their eyes – to different places, people and our industrial and mechanical heritage.\nTo me, railways capture of the buccaneering spirit of the British people and all of us here today representing different areas, different businesses, different parts of the railways sector and from different Parties, all want to see more investment in the East Coast Mainline - it is an unarguable case. All we ask is to be included and all of us Members of Parliament here today, and those who could not be here, will not cease in making that case.\nThankyou all for coming this afternoon and I hope you enjoy the rest of this event and the rest of your day.\nKarl McCartney JP MP",

Screening will focus on areas where it is most needed, tackling health disparities and improving diagnosis rates.\nThis investment will also help deliver a more accessible NHS where patients receive care close to home.\nKarl, who always Puts Lincoln First, said: “This investment is very welcome news and shows the Conservative Government’s commitment to improving women’s health here in Lincoln and across the County. This is one of many recent investments by the Conservative Government into the hospital which as the Member of Parliament is something that I will always continue to campaign for.”\nHealth Minister Helen Whately, said: “A cancer diagnosis can be terrifying but it is vital that this cruel disease is detected as soon as possible and then treated.\n“It is also important that women across the County can access high-quality healthcare wherever they live and this investment helps deliver that.\n“These units at Lincoln County Hospital mean more targeted services are available locally ensuring we have the best chance at detecting and treating breast cancer across Lincoln and Lincolnshire as a whole.”\nThe funding is now in place for NHS trusts to spend within the 2022/23 financial year and the timing for delivery of units will be individual to each trust.\nThe commitment to provide additional breast screening units was made in the Women’s Health Strategy published in July 2022 which is designed to improve equality of healthcare.\nThe government has also committed to improving diagnosis, treatment and survival rates as part of the NHS Long Term Plan. By 2028, the government has committed to 75% of people with cancer being diagnosed at stages 1 and 2, up from 55% and for 55,000 more people each year to survive their cancer for at least five years after diagnosis.\nEach year more than two million women have breast cancer screening in the UK. Screening saves around 1,300 women every year with around 21,000 cancers detected.

It is with a heavy heart today that I will be voting in favour of my Honourable Friend’s amendment, the Member of Enfield Southgate, who spoke so eloquently earlier to keep Sunday Special. I say that because, to keep Sunday special, I will be voting against my Government—a decision that no loyal member on this side of the House wants to take, certainly not regularly.\nMy reasons for supporting this amendment and why I believe other members should consider supporting it, are based on three core issues:\n- my Conservative Principles and the traditions of our Country\n- the impact on staff in all shops, and also, particularly,\n- the impact on small independent shops, their owners and their staff. These places are\n- well used and well liked in the City of Lincoln, but if Sunday is no longer special, we will lose them.\nThere is something uniquely British, perhaps Anglo-Saxon, Christian and traditional about how we mark Sunday in this great country of ours – it is the one special day we have every week and to lose that means losing something special about Britain. A week where every day is the same, will be a drab and very grey Britain.\nAnd as a Conservative who believes in our country’s traditions and culture, undermining this special day is not something I can support. I personally would go even further and look at protecting other days in the year such as Boxing Day, Good Friday and Easter Monday by maybe imposing current Sunday opening hours on these days too.\nSunday already provides enough opportunities for large scale shopping if you are up early enough– in fact, a full six hours!\nAnd those who want to shop online will do so whether or not larger shops are open for longer on Sundays.\nFor those who do not want to spend all day shopping in large malls or superstores on Sundays, there are plenty of convenience and independent shops to go to and I am fearful of the impact on these shops, the lifeblood of so many communities across our Country.\nI want to live in a country with a rich mixture of shops, not an endless sea of large faceless superstores. I fear extending the hours of larger shops on a Sunday will diminish choice, impact on the livelihood of those owning and working in those smaller shops and will ultimately damage businesses in our high streets.\nI am also concerned about the impact on the families of the shopworkers. As well as Sunday being a special day for those who do not have to work, we need to make sure it remains a special day for those who do work.\nIf we extend shopping hours, then there will be no respite for them and throughout the week all they will have is snatched time with families – they will be on a conveyor belt of work that never ends. Everyone needs ‘quality family time’ – or just time away from work - we should all work to live – not live to work.\nI understand from a big business point of view that they want to sweat their assets. Closed large stores in Bluewater, Meadowhall or anywhere around the country earn no money from shoppers, and hence no profit for their owners. In the middle of the UK, I am sure Bicester Shopping Village would want to open 24 hours, 365 days a year but what would be the effect on the staff working there?\nSunday, as it is currently, is a Great British Compromise that works for everyone.\n- Retailers can trade\n- Customers can shop\n- Shopworkers can spend some quality time with their family, and,\n- We can still have that one special day of the week.\nThe full debate can be found on Hansard at:\nhttp://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201516/cmhansrd/cm160309/deb… 9-0002.htm#16030943000002",

They would rather look to the past and do their utmost to wreck any positive actions, rather than look optimistically to the future.

Scrutiny is pivotal to all democracies. But the tone, anger and behaviour of those who oppose Brexit is as poor as you will ever see.\nThat is why I could not sign up to all of the Brexit Committee's latest Report entitled, Government's Negotiating Objectives: The White Paper. Not only is its tone about our Conservative Government relentlessly negative, it suggests, erroneously, that the Government have not set out clearly what its intention and approach is to secure a successful Brexit.\nWhilst this Committee, like all Select Committees, has a role in scrutinising and guiding the Government and perhaps suggesting policies to follow, it has to take into account the wider picture, especially those issues outside our Government's control.\nIn particular, the latest Report does not sufficiently take into account the need for a co-operative attitude and a spirit of good neighbourliness from the European Commission. The British-EU negotiation is not a one-way street.\nFurther, the Brexit Committee's Report fails to take into account the needs of the 27 EU states in ensuring that Brexit also works for them given the fact that those countries need a free-trade deal with us as well and sell more to us than we sell to them. Nor will relying on World Trade Organisation rules be in the interests of the '27', which is why the Committee should have been clearer that this is the case rather than just placing all of the emphasis and pressure on our own Government.\nThe Report reads as if it expects the UK to be the only one that has to 'give' and our European neighbours to 'take'. That is not a view that I, nor my sound minded colleagues on the Committee, would be 'bounced into' - far from it in fact. Hence we made our disquiet and intentions clear in our private deliberations with the rest of the Select Committee. We were also clear in making this disquiet known, frankly, when we were first told of the imminent draft report two days before we all received it.\nOne would hope that the 'Remain' majority on the Committee will at last accept the result of last June's Referendum and take a more pragmatic and positive, less gloomy, approach in the future. A bit like we did when confronted with their partisan Report.\nAs we face the opportunities ahead of us on this momentous journey, our shared values, interests in ensuring the wellbeing and best outcome for UK plc and our ambitions for trade and links across the whole world can - and must - bring us all together.",

Albeit, the Government may at a later date house an additional 300. Both Sir Edward and I have met the Migration Minister, Tom Pursglove MP, on numerous occasions, and again this week to discuss this matter:\nWhilst it could be seen as a positive that the numbers have been reduced, it does not go far enough because I still strongly believe that it should not be used at all. The Home Office Minister has reassured me though it will mean Gainsborough’s and Lincoln’s hotels, houses or other buildings will not be used to house immigrants, many of whom, if not all, have arrived here illegally. That is a positive.\nRAF Scampton should solely be used for regeneration and local jobs, including supporting my Constituents with work opportunities. Even with reduced numbers, I remain gravely concerned about the numbers of these men coming into Lincolnshire. I worry about the problems that this could cause. This includes issues of course surrounding public safety. I am still not reassured that the lessons learned from the terrible events at RAF Bassingbourn ten years ago have been learnt by Ministers and Civil Servants.\nAt least we Conservatives are trying to reduce illegal immigration, unlike the Labour Party who have voted against every option we have brought forward and implemented to curb immigration. But that is no surprise as they admitted their policy pre-2010 was an ’open door’ one, and they welcomed all to our shores.",

And for many, many reasons – not least that education and educational attainment is so important to me and I believe for those I seek to represent. I can think of no better way to ensure as a City, County or region, or country that we are ‘leveling up’, or enabling social mobility if you like, than giving everyone the best possible opportunity to get on in life through their education and training possibilities and this can, in fact, take place whatever their age. If I have time I will touch on the importance of lifelong learning – for all of us here this evening, in my view – ‘every day can and is a school day’\nSo this is why this invitation made the cut, not just because by presenting you with your certificates, I would be following in the footsteps of\n- the Bishop of Lincoln\n- the Lord Lieutenant for Lincolnshire\n- the High Sheriff of Lincolnshire\n- Air Vice-Marshal Warren James, and,\n- the Leader of Lincolnshire County Council\nIt was because\n- Lincoln College is not just the best College in the County, it is the best college in the Country in my humble opinion – and you might be thinking, yeah he’s just saying that – but no, I mean it;\n- it has brilliant leaders like Gary and his management team,\n- the best and most dedicated teachers and lecturers you can find anywhere, and yes, I do know some of them, some of them quite well in fact…\n- and of course, the college has some of the most talented students and now...the most talented graduates too.\nI also know some of you studied in Newark too, so I’m happy to say you are all part of this Lincolnshire and East Midlands family too!\nJust like this wonderful location in Lincoln Cathedral, the college and all of you who have graduated today represent the best of our wonderful City, a City that I have always said is the best place in Britain to live, work, visit and study. And it is probably the most loved City in the Midlands too.\nThis prestigious location matches the success of Lincoln College as it represents the hard work, dedication and talent that go into making anything a success – and all of those traits that you have all needed to show, grasp, and apply to enable you to graduate today.\nHowever, these traits were even more important than ever, given the huge disruption that you have all had due to the pandemic over the last 20 months – and I sincerely hope we are over the worst of the effects and impacts of that on our normal everyday lives.\nBut because of your strength of character, commitment to learning, and the support from the college, you have made it through. And I obviously hope that none of us ever have to go through the impositions on our freedoms that we have endured during these last 20 months again.\nAnd this evening is just the next part, or step, of your life’s journey - and even perhaps more so, given that your qualifications are all directly linked to careers - which is the real strength of taking studying at the college, which is often very different to studying at a university.\nWe have graduates here tonight studying on courses ranging from\n-\n- Business and Management to Violin Making\n-\n- Computer Science to Acupuncture\n-\n- Teaching to Sports Therapy\n-\n- And many, many more that are all very workplace applicable\nAll of which offer a clear route into successful careers in those fields.\nThe qualifications you have proudly attained are of course important from an academic and also a career perspective, but also for me, they open your eyes up to a world of possibilities.\nFor many of you, you arrive as a teenager fresh out of school, and leave as a fully grown man or woman, not just in a physical sense but also in a mental sense too.\nWhen I started studying after school, far too many moons ago now,\n- the pubs were not open all day, and in the part of Wales I was in did not open at all on a Sunday\n- we only had four TV channels in total, and,\n- the worldwide web had only just been invented\nHow our lives have changed….\nI never thought I would be a Member of Parliament, I thought that was for other people, but when I left with a degree and started my career, suddenly I thought, well, why not me?\nAnd that will now be the same for you, not necessarily being a Member of Parliament...and believe me, with some of the untrue things said about politicians, I do sometimes wonder whether I made the right choice...\nBut with these qualifications under your arm, and, with the maturity and the wider perspective you have on life, the possibilities are endless.\nThis is why it is even more apposite for you all graduating at this wonderful cathedral, some of you will know, but others may not, but between 1311, after its completion, and up to 1548, this was the tallest building in the world. For over 200 years – 500 years ago – you are now graduating in the then tallest building in the world. History can be amazing.\nLiterally, the sky was the limit back then and this is how you should all feel now.\nWhen you all look back on this part of your life’s journey, it is important to remember the people who helped you on your way.\nWithout the wonderful college, its leadership team and of course the brilliant teaching staff, who do not often the credit they rightly deserve, you would not be here today.\nSo can I ask you all as graduates to stand up for a bit of audience participation – any of you sleeping during my speech, this should now wake you up - please can we all give them all a hearty round of applause? Stay standing, please.\nWe also should not forget friends, family and guests either, so if you would like to turn around\nThey are the people in the background who are always being positive, supportive and provide that crucial shoulder to lean on... even more so when you have only a few hours to finish an essay or complete an assignment you have only just remembered you have to do.\nSo please can we all give them a round of applause too. If you turn around…\nNow as graduates you have thanked all those who have helped, assisted, taught, supported and nurtured you, and now it’s time for you to offer thanks and congratulate all of those immediately around you on your course, your peers – and maybe you can stand up – and as you give each other a round of applause, maybe all the friends family and guests, and the college team of management and teaching staff can join in a joyous and hearty round of applause to say a generous ‘group’ ‘well done indeed’ to all of you…\nLastly, as you settle back in your chairs, should you choose to continue to build your careers in this wonderful city, thankyou. And if you do not, just remember, we will always welcome you back – but enjoy and thrive whatever you do and wherever you chose to be – you have my, and everyone here’s, good wishes\nI look forward to seeing you out and about in the city in the future, or when I visit the wonderful employers we have here in the City and County.\nFor those who do move away, hopefully temporarily, but if you do, you must also tell everyone about how brilliant Lincoln College is and what a wonderful City you studied in, if you wish to, you could also say the Member of Parliament is not a bad bloke either – but that’s all anyone of us in Lincoln can ask.\nSo congratulations to each and every one of you for graduating tonight, it is very well deserved and all the very best from me as your MP – I am very proud for you all – and as my maternal Grandma always said to me and my younger brothers – usually when we complained about school or homework ‘Just remember… no-one can ever take your education away from you.’\nYou are all a part of our future! And the future is yours.\nThankyou. And a ‘Good Evening’ to you all.",

Housing the Synthetic Training System for the aircraft, the centre will enable crews from the RAF and international partners to conduct a significant amount of their training in a secure environment, linking in future with the Defence Collective Training environment under the UK Gladiator programme.\nThe new campus will support jobs across the Constituency and the County as a whole, with contracts awarded in the coming months for infrastructure improvements at the base. The campus will feature new Single Living Accommodation for Protector ground crews, a hangar, office facilities, a new road to the Protector area of RAF Waddington and a new taxiway.\nKarl, whose Lincoln Constituency includes RAF Waddington, said: “This investment is a real vote of confidence in RAF Waddington and continues to cement the air station’s place as being fundamental to the defence of our country. It is a huge milestone in the Government’s and ensures the RAF continues to have world-leading capability.\n“This investment including the new campus will support jobs across the Constituency and the County as a whole, which is of huge benefit too. Lincoln is already world-renowned for its high-technology defence and engineering sector and this investment is another clear signal of the quality why it has such a strong and deserved reputation.”\nOperating from the Lincolnshire station, the SkyGuardian aircraft has undertaken a number of sorties showcasing its impressive capabilities while also providing vital information for personnel at RAF.\nThe investment marks an important step in the development of the revolutionary Detect and Avoid technology, permitting Protector to fly in unsegregated airspace safely – as the world’s first Medium Altitude Long Endurance (MALE) Remotely Piloted Aircraft System, Protector will significantly boost the RAF’s armed Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition, and Reconnaissance (ISTAR) capability.\nThe UK’s Protector programme and the investment at RAF Waddington form part of commitments outlined in the Defence Command Paper to ensure the RAF are equipped to face future threats.

He is asking them what format a future Lincoln Christmas Market should take as he believes it should be reinstated, with changes if necessary.\nThe Lincoln MP will also be launching a series of video interviews with local traders about the impact that it has on their businesses and why they want to “Bring Back Lincoln Christmas Market”.\nKarl and his Conservative Councillor colleagues on the City of Lincoln Council have opposed the decision by the Council to close the Market. A decision made earlier this year, in secret, without asking for the opinions of local businesses, the public or community organisations. All Labour City Councillors have point blank refused to discuss or consider re-opening the Market in 2024, even in a different format, when they opposed a motion to do so. This was presented by the Conservative Councillors at the end of November.\nClosing the Market has put livelihoods, jobs, charity donations and the City's reputation at risk. The Market brings the City together and provides benefits to Lincoln’s tourism and hospitality economy all year round. This is due to visitors who come being reminded of how wonderful the City is. So, they revisit the museums, galleries, Castle, Cathedral and shops at other times of the year, and subsequent years, and puts our City firmly on the national and international map.\nIn fact, the secretive and destructive decision by Lincoln’s Labour Party, has led to widespread national ridicule of the City with negative headlines on national radio and in newspapers including papers stating “Locals slam 'bizarre' decision to scrap England's oldest Christmas market as it's too popular”, “Off Market: England’s oldest Christmas market visited by more than 300,000 people is scrapped over ‘safety risk’” and “England's oldest Christmas market is scrapped as Labour scrooges say it is too popular and would cause a 'safety risk'”.\nThe survey launched by Karl from today, is available online and as hard copies delivered across the City, and coincides to when the Market would have started. This survey asks for the views of the public and businesses on what format they believe future Christmas Markets should take in the future. That could include it being a ticketed event or being held over several weekends. Safety concerns are real but shouldn’t be used as a ‘shield’ by Labour Councillors as they rely on this to defend their indefensible decision to cancel a successful event that was great advertising for our City. It equated to probably millions of pounds of advertising spend and enhanced various sectors of our City and County’s economy - most notably hospitality, retail and tourism.\nLincoln MP, Karl, said: “From today until Sunday, our City should be welcoming people from all parts of the UK and further afield to our Christmas Market, but instead, the Labour City Council decided in secret to close it, permanently. Even though there are clear benefits for local jobs, shopkeepers and charities, as well as giving us the chance to bring the whole Lincoln community together.\n“The short-sighted decision to permanently close our historic, world-famous and much-loved Market has had a huge and long-lasting impact. The City is being ridiculed nationally.\n“It is why the decision has to be reversed and we need to ‘Bring Back Lincoln Christmas Market’.\n“The survey I have launched asks business and my constituents in various locations across the City for their views on what changes they think need to be made to the format of the Market, if any.\n“We cannot just accept this decision, but at the same time, we do need to sensibly consider what the future options are – including ticketing the event, or spreading the market over more weekends. The latter is normal both in the UK and abroad, including with our German Twin, Neustadt. Please do fill in, and share, the survey and let me know your views.”\nThe Survey can be found below.\nKarl will be publishing a range of videos over the next four days from his Facebook Page: https://www.facebook.com/KarlMcCartneyLincoln/",

I have let CCHQ and those managing the process know that I am intending to apply to be our local Greater Lincolnshire Mayoral Candidate ahead of the election in May 2025.\n“Should I be successfully chosen as the Conservative Candidate, I would campaign the length and breadth of our County alongside my County Council Candidate colleagues through to May next year. As the Mayor, I could build on my extensive links with local and national government, businesses and third sector bodies, and replicate my proven track record in delivering a range of benefits for Lincoln and Lincolnshire over the last 14+years. My plans for future prosperity, economic growth and transport infrastructure improvements for Greater Lincolnshire, will be a positive reason for the diverse electorate across our historic County to once again support Conservative Candidates.\n“Even those voters who maybe are reluctant to consider voting Conservative, I would hope might have an open mind as I positively make the case for my Candidature. Starting from today I shall be putting forward my plans for the future of Greater Lincolnshire and the exciting opportunity this Mayoral role offers, as I seek selection as our Candidate for next May. I would bring my 20 years’ experience of ‘Putting Lincoln and Lincolnshire First’ to this new important role in both Local and National politics.\n“I have a vision for Lincolnshire’s future growth, including economic, housing, energy and transport infrastructure provision improvements, which could and will empower our future, utilising strategic investments to achieve our collective aims, enabled by the role of Mayor of Greater Lincolnshire working in collaboration with the various councils across the Greater Lincolnshire area. I will bring my considerable business experience in various roles, plus knowledge from my MBA and current PhD studying Agri-tech’s role in supply chains, along with my cross-party political skills, to ensure this role successfully delivers tangible benefits for all the people across Greater Lincolnshire.\n“There is a potential for Lincolnshire to be at the forefront of various sectors in the UK with the new Greater Lincolnshire Mayor leading on the following:\nA Green Energy Hub and Lincolnshire Energy Commission - promoting a Clean Energy Corridor from Grimsby through Boston to Spalding, creating jobs and opportunities\nA rural homes for families initiative providing better planning processes and sustainable homes in places they are needed and a Town Revitalisation Fund\nTransport improvements including A15 and A16 improvements plus a Rural Mobility Partnership to improve Public Transport links and maybe install ‘on demand’ bus services in rural areas to reduce and alleviate isolation\nA Lincolnshire Agri-tech hub to enable our County to become a national leader in agricultural innovation, based in Holbeach and Riseholme, supporting our farmers to boost productivity and sustainability, and positioning Lincolnshire at the forefront of sustainable food production\nGrowing our County’s economy is a priority but we must match that growth with an adaptable, skilled workforce - a ‘Skills for Lincolnshire Programme’could help with this augmented by a Business Start-Up and Growth Fund\nExpanding the already successfully Defence Hub, created by Greater Lincolnshire LEP, with a Defence and High Tech Hub of Innovation.”\nENDS -",
  "https_www_karlmccartney_co_uk_/https_www_karlmccartney_co_uk_news_karl-raises-concerns-over-government-plans-move-electric-only-cars-2050/content_80.html": "Following the publication of the Transport Select Committee’s report ‘Fuelling the Future’ which scrutinised the Government’s plans for the transport sector to be net zero by 2050 in the UK, two committee members (Karl McCartney and Greg Smith) believe the Government’s position on private vehicles is a huge risk for the nation, legacy vehicle owners and our nation’s economy.\nThe report revealed that on the one hand, the Government has said that it is ‘technology neutral’ when it comes to what types of alternative fuel should be used for different types of transport vehicles, however, it contradicts this when it comes to private cars. This is because it is fully focused on these all being electric vehicles fuelled by batteries, with draconian impositions on new vehicles from 2030, rather than in parallel supporting the development of sustainable fuels such as biofuels and synthetic fuels. These are already being developed and increasingly used including in motorsport, high-performance cars and an RAF test flight.\nKarl, a longstanding Committee member called the Government’s position hypocritical, risky and one that does not match the reality of the available technology or affordability for normal motorists.\nKarl said: “This headlong herd-like, fashionable and naïve rush by the Government into all private cars being electric by 2050 does not make sense. There is no guarantee the number of batteries needed will be ready given worldwide demand, especially from China. Nor is there any guarantee that enough affordable electric cars will be available or there will be enough charging points that fuel such cars very quickly.\n“It makes no common sense to place all our eggs into one basket and solely rely on electric fuelled cars when there are alternatives that are already being used and developed which are also as environmentally friendly. We need to have a choice and not place our fuel future at risk which is what the Government is currently doing.\n“If it goes wrong and reality bites, as it surely will, then the Government position will be like the Emperor and his New Clothes, all bluster about how this is the future but when the time comes, it will be revealed to be not all there and individuals, business and the nation’s economic well-being will suffer.”\nGreg Smith MP (Conservative, Buckingham) added: “The virtue signalling around vehicle fuel types and electric vehicle evangelism has led us to an uncomfortable place that cannot be seen as realistic, especially for HGVs, construction and farming vehicles, but particularly ‘legacy’ internal combustion engine (ICE) private vehicles and rural areas of the UK too. The reality is that many, many people will still be driving their own ICE vehicles well after 2030, 2035, 2040 and 2050, and the most environmentally responsible decision the Government can make is to facilitate their continued use through better fuels, but negate the use of further energy and raw materials to make more new vehicles of any fuel or engine type.”\n- ENDS -",
  "https_www_karlmccartney_co_uk_/https_www_karlmccartney_co_uk_news_unseen-difference-member-parliament-can-make-lincoln/content_37.html": "Published on The Lincolnite web site\nNovember has been one of those months where as a Member of Parliament you feel you are really making a difference, locally and across the Country.\nLast week, the Ministry of Justice announced they were consulting on a new crackdown on false whiplash claims which I have been leading the campaign on in Parliament ever since I was elected and held a Parliamentary debate on in 2015. It cannot be right that the number of road accidents in the UK has been falling and cars are becoming far safer, yet the number of whiplash claims has been increasing. How can that be without some of crooked collusion?\nSo it is about time that those who falsely claim to be victims of whiplash injuries (often by faking and deliberately creating accidents) who are then in cahoots with personal injury lawyers are brought to heel. They have essentially been extorting money from insurance companies and thereby pushing up premiums for law abiding drivers – a situation that has gone on for far too long. It of course can also affect the individual insurance premiums of those who are falsely accused. We will also no longer have those law firms putting pressure on legitimate victims to exaggerate their claims and we may even end the endless telephone calls stating that you have been a car accident when you haven’t!\nI would want to go a few steps further in two ways.\nFirstly, those making false insurance vehicle claims that reach the courts must be prosecuted and actively pursued by the relevant police force. They are thumbing their nose at all of us who live within the law and should be prosecuted for it.\nSecondly, we need to increase the fines for those driving while uninsured and if they are involved in an accident, their punishment must be far more severe than it is now.\nAs this is a consultation and changes will be required, it will still be a while until concrete action takes effect, but we are moving in the right direction at last.\nLast week was also the first meeting of what is known as the Brexit Select Committee which is a committee of backbenchers who are scrutinising the Government’s progress on leaving the European Union. This was a matter I covered last month and I am proud to be a member of this Committee. I will be keeping readers up to date with progress as the months go by, but please be assured I will be not only ensuring the Government delivers Brexit but also make sure the Committee is not used as a means of delaying or stopping the process. This includes making sure the Committee is not used as a vehicle to drive anti-Brexit headlines in the Guardian or the BBC.\nAt a local level, there has been more good news for Lincoln recently. Unemployment continues to fall (45% since 2010) and we have secured more direct services to Lincoln for the Christmas market.\nAlso on Friday, the Official Opening of the Lincoln East-West Link Road took place. This type of infrastructure project is so vital in unclogging the roads of the City Centre especially for those moving around the City but do not want to go directly into the Centre. It is also the type of project where a Member of Parliament can make a real difference. For some unknown reason, the previous Labour Member of Parliament for Lincoln, despite being a Transport Minister herself, was unable to obtain the funding – even though there are clear environmental and economic benefits especially for a growing thriving City like Lincoln. By constantly knocking on the right doors in Whitehall and raising my voice in Westminster, I was able to help the County Council obtain the funding they needed to make it happen. That is an important and often unseen role that a Member of Parliament can make – and one I will never cease in undertaking.",
