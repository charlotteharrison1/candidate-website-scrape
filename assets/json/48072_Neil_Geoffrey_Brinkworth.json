Liberal Democrats had proposed this at the time that the County Council set its budget back in February but the Conservatives voted down the idea.\nLiberal Democrat education spokesperson Mark Watkin said:\n\"They say that they have now found more money for special educational needs (SEND) but we explained how they could do this, rather than just keeping additional cash in reserves for a rainy day, nearly three months ago. It is good that they have now admitted that they were wrong to block this, but it is a pity that children across Hertfordshire will have to wait an additional three months for the extra help that this money will provide. Also, while the money is welcomed, the key question is how it will be spent and we will fight to make sure that it is used to make a real difference to the families with SEND children.\"\nCouncillors were told at this week's County Council meeting that more cash would be made available for SEND but the details will not be available until next month with the decision not expected to be finally confirmed by the cabinet until July, so real improvements in the SEND service from this are still months away.",

The alternative, to create a new website would be costly and delay the reopening of the cinema. They also refused to grant permission for a summary of the legal advice to be provided to non-Councillor members of the Cinema working party. This restriction negatively impacts the operation of the working party and prevents key stakeholders; Royston First BID, cinema volunteers and programme management from having all the relevant information. None of the Councillors who voted against providing this legal advice, spoke at the meeting to explain their reasons.\nThe council appointed a cross party group, including Liberal Democrat councillors Ruth Brown and Emma Squire-Smith and Labour councillor Stephen Lockett, to the Cinema working party in April 2023. The group have been working alongside two members of the public and representatives of Royston First BID to investigate options for reopening the cinema. The project has faced several delays, due to the financial regulations councils have to abide by when procuring services, whilst the election periods meant the group was unable to meet.\nDespite the Town Council appointing a working party to investigate solutions to reopen the cinema, two proposals were submitted from outside of the working party, without their prior knowledge. One proposal was for the Council to investigate employing a cinema manager; during the meeting Councillor Squire-Smith revealed that this was something that had already been raised within the working party and that work should have already started to investigate such an option, several months ago. A further motion proposed the council purchase the cinema equipment and seating from Royston First BID. The BID have been active members of the working party and are keen to see the cinema reopen. Councillor Brown detailed how the BID have supported the Picture Palace in the past and the key role they have played in the operation of the cinema, including providing funding to enable it to stay open for an additional six months in 2023, whilst a more permanent solution was found.\nEmma Squire-Smith said “When the Cinema working party was appointed in April 2023 there were councillors from all political groups involved and the council was aligned in wanting to see the cinema reopen. Since then significant time and effort has gone into investigating the options for the cinema. However, Monday night’s meeting has proved that certain groups within the council wish to politicise the cinema and went as far as blocking two motions proposed by the cinema working party. I am hugely disappointed as the cinema is a key community asset and am firmly of the belief that councillors should be working together for the good of the town.”\nRuth Brown said “My Councillor colleagues Emma Squire-Smith, Stephen Lockett and I remain strongly committed to continuing our work, in partnership with the BID and other stakeholders, to re-open Royston Picture Palace at the earliest opportunity.”",

Where we transfer your data to a service provider that is outside of the EEA we seek to ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place to make sure that your personal data is held securely and that your rights as a data subject are upheld – in almost all cases we do this by ensuring that the agreements between us and our chosen service providers contain what are called the ‘model clauses’ that oblige them to treat your personal data as if they themselves were based in the EEA.\nIn addition, we may share your personal data with third parties when we are required to do so by law (for example, with the Police where they ask us to assist them with their investigations).

This made up 1 in 6 of all GP appointments that month, up from 1 in 10 in January. Across the country, over five million GP appointments took more than two weeks in September, making up 17.9% of all GP visits.\nThe Liberal Democrats said the “alarming figures” show that patients in Hitchin and Harpenden are being let down. It comes as the Liberal Democrats have set out plans for patients to have a right to see their GP within a week, or within 24 hours if in urgent need.\nThe policy would enshrine this right in the NHS Constitution, putting a duty on the government and health service to make sure it happens. It would be achieved by increasing the number of GPs, fixing pension rules to prevent so many doctors retiring early, and increasing the number of nurses and pharmacists who are fully qualified to prescribe day to day medicines.\nThe proposals are being set out by Liberal Democrat Leader Ed Davey at a major Autumn speech this weekend, which is being attended by local health campaigners.\nSam Collins, Liberal Democrat candidate for Hitchin and Harpenden, said:\n“These alarming figures show our local health service is being driven into the ground under this Conservative government.\n“Behind these statistics are so many people and families in Hitchin & Harpenden anxiously waiting for an appointment for worrying symptoms. Many are being seen far far too late.\n“I am proud that Liberal Democrats have put forward a credible plan to ensure everyone is seen by a GP within one week. It should be implemented with urgency to save our local health service and finally give people in Hertfordshire a fair deal.\n“Every day this Government’s promises become more and more hollow. The sad truth is they are disinterested in our NHS, and refuse to take action to pull it back from the brink. People in Hertfordshire will pay the price if this government continues to take us for granted and sit on their hands”\n“The problem is very serious, there are not enough GP’s, and access to surgeries is getting harder, as residents of Kimpton for example know too well. The Government needs to take urgent action to get more people to train as GPs, by increasing places in the relevant training courses and facilities.”\nLiberal Democrat Leader Ed Davey added:\n“Far too many people in Hertfordshire and across the country are struggling to get a GP appointment when they need one, leaving them waiting anxiously for the care they deserve.\n“This can lead to missed or delayed diagnoses, or people turning in desperation to our overstretched A&E departments instead.\n“Patients are suffering from years of neglect under the Conservatives, who have repeatedly broken their promise to recruit more GPs.\n“Liberal Democrats would guarantee people a right to a GP appointment within one week, or within 24 hours if they are in urgent need. This would reduce pressure on our hospitals and paramedics, saving crucial time and money elsewhere in the NHS.”",

People here are being forced to suffer unfair tax hikes and cuts to our public services for years to come.\n“We need a fair deal, including support for people unable to afford skyrocketing mortgage bills and rents, and protecting funding for local health services. This could be paid for by reversing tax cuts for banks and a proper windfall tax, instead of imposing years of stealth taxes on ordinary families.This is an out of touch Government which has no plan to help people in Hertfordshire with their bills.\"",

This made up 1 in 6 of all GP appointments that month, up from 1 in 10 in January. Across the country, over five million GP appointments took more than two weeks in September, making up 17.9% of all GP visits.\nThe Liberal Democrats said the “alarming figures” show that patients in Hitchin and Harpenden are being let down. It comes as the Liberal Democrats have set out plans for patients to have a right to see their GP within a week, or within 24 hours if in urgent need.\nThe policy would enshrine this right in the NHS Constitution, putting a duty on the government and health service to make sure it happens. It would be achieved by increasing the number of GPs, fixing pension rules to prevent so many doctors retiring early, and increasing the number of nurses and pharmacists who are fully qualified to prescribe day to day medicines.\nThe proposals are being set out by Liberal Democrat Leader Ed Davey at a major Autumn speech this weekend, which is being attended by local health campaigners.\nSam Collins, Liberal Democrat candidate for Hitchin and Harpenden, said:\n“These alarming figures show our local health service is being driven into the ground under this Conservative government.\n“Behind these statistics are so many people and families in Hitchin & Harpenden anxiously waiting for an appointment for worrying symptoms. Many are being seen far far too late.\n“I am proud that Liberal Democrats have put forward a credible plan to ensure everyone is seen by a GP within one week. It should be implemented with urgency to save our local health service and finally give people in Hertfordshire a fair deal.\n“Every day this Government’s promises become more and more hollow. The sad truth is they are disinterested in our NHS, and refuse to take action to pull it back from the brink. People in Hertfordshire will pay the price if this government continues to take us for granted and sit on their hands”\n“The problem is very serious, there are not enough GP’s, and access to surgeries is getting harder, as residents of Kimpton for example know too well. The Government needs to take urgent action to get more people to train as GPs, by increasing places in the relevant training courses and facilities.”\nLiberal Democrat Leader Ed Davey added:\n“Far too many people in Hertfordshire and across the country are struggling to get a GP appointment when they need one, leaving them waiting anxiously for the care they deserve.\n“This can lead to missed or delayed diagnoses, or people turning in desperation to our overstretched A&E departments instead.\n“Patients are suffering from years of neglect under the Conservatives, who have repeatedly broken their promise to recruit more GPs.\n“Liberal Democrats would guarantee people a right to a GP appointment within one week, or within 24 hours if they are in urgent need. This would reduce pressure on our hospitals and paramedics, saving crucial time and money elsewhere in the NHS.”",

Liberal Democrat Parliamentary Candidate Sam Collins slams mini-budget: “Local homeowners have been betrayed by Truss and Kwarteng’s out of touch Conservative Government. A typical family faces a £2,000 rise in mortgage bills following last week’s disastrous budget.\"\nFollowing the Chancellor’s budget, thousands of households in Hertfordshire are are expected to be hit by a “monster” mortgage rate rise over the coming months, new analysis by the Liberal Democrats has revealed. This includes more than 37,000 households in the North Hertfordshire and St. Albans Districts.\nA third of all homes in Hitchin & Harpenden are owned with a mortgage, above the national average of 28%, meaning that this increase in rates is going to hit our area harder than some others.\nThe fallout from last week’s budget is predicted to force the Bank of England to raise interest rates to as much as 5% next year, costing the average mortgage borrower on a Standard Variable Rate a staggering £2,100 per year. Those on an average tracker mortgage would face an even higher annual increase of £3,000 per year if interest rates rise to the predicted 5% next year. This would more than wipe out the government’s assistance on energy bills for average households.\nThe Liberal Democrats are calling on Liz Truss to recall Parliament and amend the budget which has crashed the pound and seen the national debt skyrocket, as well as leading to predicted rises in mortgage interest rates.\nSam Collins, Liberal Democrat Parliamentary Candidate for Hitchin & Harpenden, said:\n“Local homeowners have been utterly let down yet again by this chaotic Conservative government. I’m not sure if it is because they are out of touch or is they are simply incompetent but in their first budget, Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng have introduced unfunded, and unnecessary tax cuts for big banks which have sent the financial markets into turmoil. Staggeringly the local Conservative MP, Bim Afolami has described the budget as ‘re-assuring’ in a recent newspaper column.\n\"I don’t think the thousands of people in our area with mortgages who have been left to to pick up the bill for this mess will be at all re-assured by this mini budget or Afolami’s support of it.\n\"Instead people on the doorstep are telling me that they are really frightened by this upcoming interest rate rise. Many simply don’t know how they’ll afford to pay thousands of pounds more a year, especially in the midst of a cost of living crisis.\n\"Liz Truss owes local people an apology for this shambolic budget. Afolami owes local people an apology for supporting it. Parliament must be recalled to fix this budget before it’s too late. This Government’s experiment has clearly failed, and people in Hitchin & Harpenden and across the country are paying the price.\n\"I don’t think it would be controversial, or even a matter of dispute, to say that our area, and the whole nation is utterly fed up of a Conservative government lurching from one crisis to another. It is time for a change, we badly need a general election.\"",

Specifically, that processing may include using those aspects of your personal data to help us to plan and execute political campaigns, canvass for your support (such as by visiting or calling you), raise funds, and perform casework that relates to you and your local community.\nYou do have rights to ask us to stop processing your data for these purposes, and you can read details about those rights here . In addition to the above we may also process your data for other purposes where you ask us to, or enter into a relationship with us that requires us to.\nFor example, if you choose to join us as a volunteer we will need to process your personal data to record that you have given us your support in this way. A contract will be put in place between you and us and we will process your personal data to the extent that we need to in order to fulfil our obligations under that contract.\nSimilarly, you may from time to time give us your consent to send you communications by e-mail (or similar mediums) which promote our work. Where you do that we will use your details to send you those kinds of communications until you tell us otherwise. Should you ever ask us to stop sending those kinds of communications we will hold your details on file to ensure that we respect that request – we justify that retention on the basis that we have a legitimate interest in holding your data in that way.\nFinally, where we have received your personal data in the various ways described above, we may continue to hold it as part of our records after the relevant processing has stopped. We hold data in this way because we have a legitimate interest in doing so. Specifically, where you have been a member or a volunteer (or have otherwise engaged with us such as by attending a conference or event, or by responding to a survey or questionnaire) we have a legitimate interest in holding your personal data to help us to monitor the numbers and the diversity of people who engage with us, as well as a legitimate interest in making sure that we can follow up any complaints or grievances which you may raise (or which people may raise about you).\nThe Party will not sell your personal data to third parties.\nDepending on how and why you provide us with your personal data it may be shared within the Party (e.g. between local, regional and national parts of the party) and our elected representatives. It may also be shared with those who provide services to the Party (“service providers”).\nWe may use service providers to undertake processing operations on our behalf to provide us with a variety of administrative, statistical, advertising and technical services. We will only supply service providers with the minimum amount of personal data they need to fulfil the services we request. We oblige all of our data processors to sign contracts with us that clearly set out their commitment to respecting individual rights, protecting your personal data – including not using it for any purpose other than providing us with an agreed service or fulfilling their legal obligations - and their commitments to assisting us to help you exercise your rights as a data subject.\nWith your consent, service providers may hold personal data about you in order to facilitate the provision of future services or financial transactions to which you have agreed, such as a payment processor retaining your payment details in order to process agreed future payments from you.\nPlease note that some of our service providers are based outside of the European Economic Area (the “EEA”). Where we transfer your data to a service provider that is outside of the EEA we seek to ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place to make sure that your personal data is held securely and that your rights as a data subject are upheld – in almost all cases we do this by ensuring that the agreements between us and our chosen service providers contain what are called the ‘model clauses’ that oblige them to treat your personal data as if they themselves were based in the EEA.\nIn addition, we may share your personal data with third parties when we are required to do so by law (for example, with the Police where they ask us to assist them with their investigations). In some cases, this may result in your personal data becoming public.\nIn particular, the Party and our candidates are required to submit records, including personal data, of donations above certain thresholds to the relevant regulatory authority. In some cases, some of these donation details are made public.

I urge everyone to use this excellent new Road Safety asset.”\n\"Safety of local residents has always been a top priority for me\n“Some residents have queried its closeness to the Chells Way/Mobbsbury Way junction but the Highways engineers said that is the only practical location for it.\n“I have made sure that there are floodlights on all the other 4 zebra crossings in Chells Division but the designers were clear that this one does not need floodlights. I would be interested in local residents’ views on this aspect of the new crossing.\n“My observations show that already it is very heavily used, which is excellent, because that was my intention.”",

With your help, we can right this wrong and we can demonstrate to the people of Hitchin and the villages that they can trust me as their next MP to serve the people and not the narrow interests of either the trades’ union puppet masters or to feather the nest of the big money donors.

Specifically, where you have been a member or a volunteer (or have otherwise engaged with us such as by attending a conference or event, or by responding to a survey or questionnaire) we have a legitimate interest in holding your personal data to help us to monitor the numbers and the diversity of people who engage with us, as well as a legitimate interest in making sure that we can follow up any complaints or grievances which you may raise (or which people may raise about you).\nThe Party will not sell your personal data to third parties.\nDepending on how and why you provide us with your personal data it may be shared within the Party (e.g. between local, regional and national parts of the party) and our elected representatives. It may also be shared with those who provide services to the Party (“service providers”).\nWe may use service providers to undertake processing operations on our behalf to provide us with a variety of administrative, statistical, advertising and technical services. We will only supply service providers with the minimum amount of personal data they need to fulfil the services we request. We oblige all of our data processors to sign contracts with us that clearly set out their commitment to respecting individual rights, protecting your personal data – including not using it for any purpose other than providing us with an agreed service or fulfilling their legal obligations - and their commitments to assisting us to help you exercise your rights as a data subject.\nWith your consent, service providers may hold personal data about you in order to facilitate the provision of future services or financial transactions to which you have agreed, such as a payment processor retaining your payment details in order to process agreed future payments from you.\nPlease note that some of our service providers are based outside of the European Economic Area (the “EEA”). Where we transfer your data to a service provider that is outside of the EEA we seek to ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place to make sure that your personal data is held securely and that your rights as a data subject are upheld – in almost all cases we do this by ensuring that the agreements between us and our chosen service providers contain what are called the ‘model clauses’ that oblige them to treat your personal data as if they themselves were based in the EEA.\nIn addition, we may share your personal data with third parties when we are required to do so by law (for example, with the Police where they ask us to assist them with their investigations). In some cases, this may result in your personal data becoming public.\nIn particular, the Party and our candidates are required to submit records, including personal data, of donations above certain thresholds to the relevant regulatory authority. In some cases, some of these donation details are made public. For more details about this, please contact us.\nHowever, save for the limited circumstances noted above, we will never pass your personal data to any unrelated third parties unless you have given us your permission to do so.\nA cookie is a small text file placed on your device when you visit a website.

For example, where you have signed a petition and are clearly informed that this petition will be presented to a third party.\nThe Party is a registered national political party in the UK; our work is designed to promote our values and to engage UK citizens in the democratic process.\nAccordingly, our work is considered to be of substantial public interest. Because of that public interest basis we are entitled to process sensitive personal data which relates to your political opinions, and your personal data more generally, for the purposes of enabling us to perform our work effectively. Specifically, that processing may include using those aspects of your personal data to help us to plan and execute political campaigns, canvass for your support (such as by visiting or calling you), raise funds, and perform casework that relates to you and your local community.\nYou do have rights to ask us to stop processing your data for these purposes, and you can read details about those rights here . In addition to the above we may also process your data for other purposes where you ask us to, or enter into a relationship with us that requires us to.\nFor example, if you choose to join us as a volunteer we will need to process your personal data to record that you have given us your support in this way. A contract will be put in place between you and us and we will process your personal data to the extent that we need to in order to fulfil our obligations under that contract.\nSimilarly, you may from time to time give us your consent to send you communications by e-mail (or similar mediums) which promote our work. Where you do that we will use your details to send you those kinds of communications until you tell us otherwise. Should you ever ask us to stop sending those kinds of communications we will hold your details on file to ensure that we respect that request – we justify that retention on the basis that we have a legitimate interest in holding your data in that way.\nFinally, where we have received your personal data in the various ways described above, we may continue to hold it as part of our records after the relevant processing has stopped. We hold data in this way because we have a legitimate interest in doing so.

We will only supply service providers with the minimum amount of personal data they need to fulfil the services we request. We oblige all of our data processors to sign contracts with us that clearly set out their commitment to respecting individual rights, protecting your personal data – including not using it for any purpose other than providing us with an agreed service or fulfilling their legal obligations - and their commitments to assisting us to help you exercise your rights as a data subject.\nWith your consent, service providers may hold personal data about you in order to facilitate the provision of future services or financial transactions to which you have agreed, such as a payment processor retaining your payment details in order to process agreed future payments from you.\nPlease note that some of our service providers are based outside of the European Economic Area (the “EEA”). Where we transfer your data to a service provider that is outside of the EEA we seek to ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place to make sure that your personal data is held securely and that your rights as a data subject are upheld – in almost all cases we do this by ensuring that the agreements between us and our chosen service providers contain what are called the ‘model clauses’ that oblige them to treat your personal data as if they themselves were based in the EEA.\nIn addition, we may share your personal data with third parties when we are required to do so by law (for example, with the Police where they ask us to assist them with their investigations). In some cases, this may result in your personal data becoming public.\nIn particular, the Party and our candidates are required to submit records, including personal data, of donations above certain thresholds to the relevant regulatory authority.

In these difficult financial times it is important to maintain our commitment to support local businesses and shoppers.”\nLiberal Democrat District Cllr, Tim Johnson and local businessman, Paul Bowes of Bow Books, both additionally addressed the meeting in support of retaining free after three parking.\nCllr Johnson said, \"It's so important that we stand shoulder to shoulder with our local businesses who add so much to our quality of life in Royston.

The alternative, to create a new website would be costly and delay the reopening of the cinema. They also refused to grant permission for a summary of the legal advice to be provided to non-Councillor members of the Cinema working party. This restriction negatively impacts the operation of the working party and prevents key stakeholders; Royston First BID, cinema volunteers and programme management from having all the relevant information. None of the Councillors who voted against providing this legal advice, spoke at the meeting to explain their reasons.\nThe council appointed a cross party group, including Liberal Democrat councillors Ruth Brown and Emma Squire-Smith and Labour councillor Stephen Lockett, to the Cinema working party in April 2023. The group have been working alongside two members of the public and representatives of Royston First BID to investigate options for reopening the cinema. The project has faced several delays, due to the financial regulations councils have to abide by when procuring services, whilst the election periods meant the group was unable to meet.\nDespite the Town Council appointing a working party to investigate solutions to reopen the cinema, two proposals were submitted from outside of the working party, without their prior knowledge. One proposal was for the Council to investigate employing a cinema manager; during the meeting Councillor Squire-Smith revealed that this was something that had already been raised within the working party and that work should have already started to investigate such an option, several months ago. A further motion proposed the council purchase the cinema equipment and seating from Royston First BID. The BID have been active members of the working party and are keen to see the cinema reopen. Councillor Brown detailed how the BID have supported the Picture Palace in the past and the key role they have played in the operation of the cinema, including providing funding to enable it to stay open for an additional six months in 2023, whilst a more permanent solution was found.\nEmma Squire-Smith said “When the Cinema working party was appointed in April 2023 there were councillors from all political groups involved and the council was aligned in wanting to see the cinema reopen. Since then significant time and effort has gone into investigating the options for the cinema. However, Monday night’s meeting has proved that certain groups within the council wish to politicise the cinema and went as far as blocking two motions proposed by the cinema working party. I am hugely disappointed as the cinema is a key community asset and am firmly of the belief that councillors should be working together for the good of the town.”\nRuth Brown said “My Councillor colleagues Emma Squire-Smith, Stephen Lockett and I remain strongly committed to continuing our work, in partnership with the BID and other stakeholders, to re-open Royston Picture Palace at the earliest opportunity.”",

Liberal Democrat Parliamentary Candidate Sam Collins slams mini-budget: “Local homeowners have been betrayed by Truss and Kwarteng’s out of touch Conservative Government. A typical family faces a £2,000 rise in mortgage bills following last week’s disastrous budget.\"\nFollowing the Chancellor’s budget, thousands of households in Hertfordshire are are expected to be hit by a “monster” mortgage rate rise over the coming months, new analysis by the Liberal Democrats has revealed. This includes more than 37,000 households in the North Hertfordshire and St. Albans Districts.\nA third of all homes in Hitchin & Harpenden are owned with a mortgage, above the national average of 28%, meaning that this increase in rates is going to hit our area harder than some others.\nThe fallout from last week’s budget is predicted to force the Bank of England to raise interest rates to as much as 5% next year, costing the average mortgage borrower on a Standard Variable Rate a staggering £2,100 per year. Those on an average tracker mortgage would face an even higher annual increase of £3,000 per year if interest rates rise to the predicted 5% next year. This would more than wipe out the government’s assistance on energy bills for average households.\nThe Liberal Democrats are calling on Liz Truss to recall Parliament and amend the budget which has crashed the pound and seen the national debt skyrocket, as well as leading to predicted rises in mortgage interest rates.\nSam Collins, Liberal Democrat Parliamentary Candidate for Hitchin & Harpenden, said:\n“Local homeowners have been utterly let down yet again by this chaotic Conservative government. I’m not sure if it is because they are out of touch or is they are simply incompetent but in their first budget, Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng have introduced unfunded, and unnecessary tax cuts for big banks which have sent the financial markets into turmoil. Staggeringly the local Conservative MP, Bim Afolami has described the budget as ‘re-assuring’ in a recent newspaper column.\n\"I don’t think the thousands of people in our area with mortgages who have been left to to pick up the bill for this mess will be at all re-assured by this mini budget or Afolami’s support of it.\n\"Instead people on the doorstep are telling me that they are really frightened by this upcoming interest rate rise. Many simply don’t know how they’ll afford to pay thousands of pounds more a year, especially in the midst of a cost of living crisis.\n\"Liz Truss owes local people an apology for this shambolic budget. Afolami owes local people an apology for supporting it. Parliament must be recalled to fix this budget before it’s too late. This Government’s experiment has clearly failed, and people in Hitchin & Harpenden and across the country are paying the price.\n\"I don’t think it would be controversial, or even a matter of dispute, to say that our area, and the whole nation is utterly fed up of a Conservative government lurching from one crisis to another.
